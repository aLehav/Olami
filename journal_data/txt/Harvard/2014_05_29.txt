After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At halftime against Cornell, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team was tied, 6-6, with the then-No. 2 Big Red.
But this was not just halftime for the game. This was the halftime for the season.
To that point, the Crimson had gone 6-4, struggled against talented opponents, and had losses to UNC, Duke, UMass, and Albany, with hardly any impressive victories.
But the Harvard squad that emerged from the locker room break was not the team that went into it.
“We knew that if we played our best, we were going to win,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “I vividly remember seeing a genuine sense of confidence in our players’ eyes.”
The Crimson outscored Cornell, 6-1, in the third quarter, ultimately clinching the victory and taking a step in a new direction while handing the Big Red its first loss of the season. From that point, Harvard won four of its next five games, beating ranked conference opponents Princeton and Yale.
Harvard finished with the best record in the Ivy League, and ultimately came  in second in the Ancient Eight tournament just one year after finishing 6-8 overall and 2-4 in the conference.
“The Cornell game was the turning point,” Wojcik said. “It was a breakthrough for us for the rest of the season.”
And perhaps even more importantly, largely thanks to the victory against the Big Red, the Crimson was able to put together a strong enough résumé to receive one of eight at-large bids to the NCAA tournament, in which it eventually succumbed to Notre Dame in the first round on May 10.
This was the first time that Harvard had defeated Cornell since 1999, breaking the 16-game streak of dominance by the Big Red.
Last year when the teams played in Harvard Stadium, the Big Red won, 14-12, coming back from a three-goal deficit to finish the game on a 5-0 run. This year, playing in Ithaca, the expectations for the Crimson were low.
“We’ve come close to beating Cornell before,” co-captain defenseman Joe Petrucci said. “But since I’ve been here, even though the score has ended up close, we never really were ready. They always had so much more confidence and would approach the game as if they had already won it.”
This time, however, things were different. In the end, Harvard did not just win the game, but won handily, and made a strong case for its emergence as a potential national power.
“Cornell has been the standard for the Ivy League over the last 10 years,” Wojcik said. “To beat them on their home field was a validation for our players that we can legitimately beat anyone.”
The Big Red jumped out to an early lead in the contest, outscoring the Crimson, 4-1, but Harvard came back to tie it with 13 minutes left in the second quarter.
Cornell then quickly went up by two goals, but once again the Crimson answered, led by co-captain Peter Schwartz. The midfielder forced a turnover in his own end of the field, scooped up the ground ball, ran the length of the field, and scored, invigorating his teammates and cutting the lead down to one before sophomore attackman Will Walker tied the score going into halftime.
Harvard had been outperformed by its opponent in several aspects of the game up to that point. The Big Red had controlled most of the ground balls, had committed fewer turnovers, and—despite giving up several man-up opportunities—had prevented the Crimson from capitalizing on these chances.
The one aspect of the game in which Harvard had been better than Cornell was in faceoffs, which was the primary reason that the game was still close. Senior midfielder Gabe Mendola won 10 of the 13 faceoffs in the first half.
“We looked at each other at halftime and knew that we were sick of being the ‘little brother’ to them for so long,” Petrucci said. “We wanted to change that attitude, and we did.”
In the second half, the Crimson began securing more ground balls and limiting its turnovers, and Mendola continued to dominate in faceoffs, finishing 20-of-26 and scooping up 10 ground balls on the day.
As a result of this, Harvard dominated the possession game, which led it to outshoot the Big Red, 38-21.
Walker finished with four goals and one assist, while sophomore attackman Devin Dwyer had three assists and one goal.
“Lacrosse is a game of runs and momentum,” Wojcik said. “We came out of the locker room at halftime and began playing the best lacrosse we had played up to that point. The confidence continues to build after a game like that, and it really made a difference for our season.”

Six and a half billion dollars. Is Harvard worth it?
It is the question that every potential donor, no matter how deep his or her pockets, must ask as they mull the Harvard’s record-seeking capital campaign. As University leaders are fond of saying, a capital campaign is much more than just raising money: it is a chance to crystallize—in dollars, buildings, or initiatives—what Harvard is today and what it is becoming. From techniques in the classroom to the University’s physical footprint to the composition of its faculty and student body, the campaign shapes Harvard as much as it reflects its aspirations.
It also represents a turning point in the history of Harvard and its place in an increasingly globalized economy of knowledge and wealth. Harvard, like much of the world, has slowly recovered from a devastating financial crisis. It has endured consequential administrative scandals—in Massachusetts Hall in the first decade of the 21st century, and in University Hall in the second.
This capital campaign—its motivations, its methods, and its goals—will show the world how, and how effectively, Harvard’s leaders are addressing the challenges and opportunities that new landscapes of education, labor, research, and finance present. 
 
This special report takes aim at those challenges and opportunities, scrutinizing some of Harvard’s biggest pedagogical and research aspirations, taking stock of its attractiveness in a crowded philanthropy market, and analyzing the financial performance of its $32.7 billion in-house investment arm, where much of the money it stands to raise will be funneled. These stories also peer into the University’s influential fundraising apparatus and carefully coordinated outreach effort, with the understanding that how Harvard makes the pitch says something about what it is selling.
While The Harvard Campaign is far from all that is going on at this large institution, making sense of it is, at the very least, a useful tool in understanding where Harvard stands in 2014. We hope this serves as that resource to you.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the past two seasons, the Harvard men’s tennis team went 6-1 in conference play to capture the Ivy League title, earned an NCAA Tournament berth, and ultimately reached the Round of 32 before falling to a highly-ranked major-conference opponent.
This year, the squad replicated all of those feats except for another Ancient Eight championship, which Columbia captured by virtue of its undefeated conference season.
But though the Crimson fell just shy of winning its third-straight Ivy crown, it still put together another strong conference campaign and proved that it can consistently compete on the national scene.
“[Achieving national success] means a lot,” junior Shaun Chaudhuri said. “Before my class came in, we wanted to make Harvard tennis a national-caliber program. With the help of the upperclassmen and the new additions, we’ve been able to do it.”
Last year, the squad was reliant on its doubles teams to set the tone and give the team an early advantage in matches, but this year’s edition of the Crimson was able to maintain most of its doubles prowess while packing a stronger punch in singles.
“This year, we had some new doubles teams,” Harvard coach Dave Fish ’72 said. “We learned we could gut out a lot of matches without winning the doubles point, and that gave us a different type of confidence.”
Co-captain Casey MacMaster and junior Denis Nguyen had another banner year at No. 1 doubles. The duo was ranked as high as sixth nationally and earned an NCAA doubles bid.
In singles, junior co-captain Alex Steinroeder maintained his consistency in the middle of the lineup, posting a 10-5 mark in dual play, while freshman Sebastian Beltrame’s emergence allowed Chaudhuri to slide down to the third slot, where he went 7-3 in dual matches.
Nguyen also took a leap forward this year in his second go-around in the top slot, finishing 11-4 in dual play. Nguyen, who was ranked as highly as No. 31 in the country, was named to his third straight All-Ivy team and received an at-large selection into the NCAA singles bracket.
The team’s ability to sustain the success of the past season after the departure of Andy Nguyen ’13 while working three freshmen into the lineup makes the squad’s accomplishments all the more impressive.
Andrew Ball was a solid contributor at the bottom of the singles lineup and had a 25-9 overall record for the season. Brian Yeung was a valuable member of both the singles and doubles teams, earning a 9-6 record in singles dual play and partnering with sophomore Nicky Hu—Andy Nguyen’s former partner—to go 21-10 at second doubles.
But the freshman who had the largest impact was Beltrame, who stepped in and worked his way up to the No. 2 singles spot by the end of the season, posting a 9-9 record in dual play. The Windermere, Fla., native also teamed with junior Christo Schultz to lock down the No. 3 doubles spot, and the duo went 12-3 in dual matches.
It was trial by fire for the first-years, as the team commenced its spring season by facing top competition such as Mississippi State and South Carolina.
“We could see the potential of the team, but we also saw the learning curve,” Fish said. “The freshman got to see right away what real national competition looked like.”
Harvard found its rhythm as the spring progressed—until it ran into Columbia. In the first match of its Ivy title defense, Harvard got off to a poor start and was humbled by the Lions, 7-0. Columbia eventually advanced to the Round of 16 in the NCAA Tournament, falling to No. 1 University of Southern California.
But from there, the Crimson blitzed through the rest of the conference season, clinching second place with a 4-1 win over Dartmouth and playing well enough to earn an at-large bid to NCAAs.
Harvard showcased its strength in singles in its first round matchup, when it lost the doubles point to Auburn, but roared back with four efficient victories in singles to advance. The Crimson then pushed No. 2 Oklahoma in doubles in its second round matchup but ultimately fell, 4-0.
“By any standard, this was a very successful season,” Fish said. “But we also left a little bit hungry that we could do more. We’re not satisfied.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After experiencing some growing pains with a young squad, the future looks bright for the Harvard women’s tennis team. While the Crimson struggled in conference play, finishing fourth in the Ivy League, the team closed out the season with an 11-8 overall record and victories against three ranked opponents to end the year seeded 53rd nationally.
“I’m really proud of the way our team came together this season,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “We played a lot of tough competition and really found our stride towards the end of the season. Unfortunately, some of those close matches didn’t go our way, but we learned a lot, and we really set ourselves up nicely for next year: we have a national ranking, and we also had some individual success.”
Harvard’s most impressive victory came on Feb. 21, when the Crimson stunned 11th-ranked Clemson with a 4-3 victory to earn the program’s first ever win over a top-15 opponent under Green.
With her team facing a 3-0 deficit and first set losses in three of the top four singles matches, freshman June Lee provided the momentum shift for Harvard, easily dispatching her opponent in two sets. Her teammates then rose to the occasion, as the Crimson rattled off four straight wins to pull off the comeback victory against the Tigers.
“It was an amazing comeback,” Green said. “Everyone was energized and enthusiastic all the way through and believed all the way…. I’ve never seen a match like that in my life, to be down by so much and come back against a very good team.”
The Crimson owed much of its success to the impressive play of its freshman class. Spencer Liang, Monica Lin, and Lee competed in the top three singles positions, with Liang remaining in the top spot the entire season. Lin also proved to be a force in the second slot, where she owned a 13-4 mark in dual action.
“Our freshmen were very talented,” Green said. “They sort of propped us up most of the season. They did run into some bumps along the way; our upperclassmen had to lead the way from time to time, but we’re looking for more good things out of them next year.”
After a stellar freshman campaign, Amy He played most of the year at fourth singles behind her younger teammates. The sophomore thrived in the fourth spot, leading Harvard in Ivy League play with a 6-1 record while posting an 11-4 overall mark on her way to being named the team’s Most Valuable Player.
Despite the flashes of brilliance from the Crimson’s younger players, Harvard struggled in Ivy League play at the close of the season. The team dropped four matches, including its last two, to conclude the season with a 3-4 conference record and fifth-place finish.
There were bright spots even amidst the struggles, however, such as the team’s hard-fought win over Penn immediately after a tough loss to Princeton.
After going back and forth all match, senior captain Hannah Morrill rallied in the third set to grab a 7-6 victory off the tiebreaker and clinch the win for Harvard.
“Hannah was our senior captain, so that’s a significant loss for us,” Green said. “She surprised us a couple times this year where her singles actually made a jump. She clinched quite a few matches for us in those 4-3 matches…. [She] will be a loss for us, but I’m very confident that our new captain coming in will be able to fill her shoes.”
With Morrill the only senior graduating from the Crimson’s starting lineup and the freshmen having gained a year of experience under their belts, the team hopes to build off of its successes this season to accomplish even more next year.
“Everyone really came together as a team and fought really hard this year, and we are starting to set new goals for ourselves,” Lee said.
“We definitely want to win Ivies, but we want to look at the bigger picture, what standards and goals that we’re setting in practice,” she added.  “If we set high goals and have the right mindset in practice, we’ll be able to execute in matches. That’s definitely our main goal, and the results will come.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The scoreboard read 29-24.
When the final whistle blew after 80 minutes of play, the Crimson gathered off the field. It was a disappointing defeat, having given up a 19-0 halftime lead to fall to Indiana University in the consolation match of the USA Rugby Collegiate Division I National Championship.
But even a loss in the final game of the season could not diminish the success that the Harvard rugby squad had achieved in its inaugural season as a varsity team.
“I am really proud of the progress the team made this season, both in the fall and the spring,” co-captain Xanni Brown said. “I think the progress we made in the fall, we very much built on in the spring. I was very proud of how the team played. How we showed up at nationals, I think, is a huge testament to how much work the team put in this year.”
It was a historic season for the Crimson (7-6), as the squad captured its first-ever Ivy League Championship to cap off its fall schedule in November. A 10-5 loss to Dartmouth was the only major blemish in the first half of Harvard’s season, but the Crimson stormed back a month later with a 29-0 rout of the Big Green to take the Ancient Eight title.
The success of the fall set the stage for a strong spring campaign. Unfortunately for Harvard, a slew of season-ending injuries to key components of its starting lineup posed a challenge for the up-and-coming team. In the second half of the season, the injury-hampered squad matched up with some of the toughest competition it faced all season, including a road trip to No. 1 Penn State.
“We lost quite a few starting players,” said co-captain Brandy Machado, who missed much of the spring slate with a concussion. “The teams we were playing were very hard, [but] we didn’t get smashed, and that was with a lot of new players on the field. That’s a really good sign for the future of the program. I am really excited to see where they take the team after [the seniors] are gone.”
The Crimson—fielding some fresh faces in the lineup—ended its inaugural season with three straight losses to top-tier talent. Harvard held its own in a 50-12 loss to the Nittany Lions, and followed up the defeat with a pair of close losses to UNC and Indiana at the national championships in Bowling Green, Ohio.
“There’s a huge difference  from August—anyone on the team would attest to that,” co-captain Ali Haber said. “We have been working really hard all year. We better understand how a varsity Harvard team works and what it’s like to try to play on the national level.”
In its first varsity season, the Crimson had to navigate the hurdles in switching from a club program to a full-fledged varsity squad. The transition meant that the team had full access to varsity ammenities—a locker room, a full weight room, and a training staff. Being varsity meant the squad no longer had to scrounge up money for cramped hotel rooms at away tournaments.
But the switch to varsity came with an increasingly demanding practice and travel schedule, which required each player to step up their commitment to the team.
“It was really good for us to see how people managed the commitment,” Haber said. “For a lot of people, it strengthened their commitment to rugby. Some people left, and we knew that would happen, but for a lot of people, it became a choice to really commit to this, and I think that is really good for the future of the program.”
Building on the foundation left from the Radcliffe rugby club team, and under the tutelage of coach Sue Parker, the Crimson rose up the rugby ranks with its strong fall season, carrying a No. 11 national ranking into its spring slate.
“We have set our standards now, and what we know as success and what we will accept as competitive excellence,” Brown said. “The team next year is going to be much more competitive than it was this year, and it’s been exciting seeing a program built up like that.”
Parker, who previously coached perennial rugby powerhouse Navy along with the U.S. women’s rugby national team, brought a wealth of coaching experience at the national and international level to the Crimson. While Parker has certainly provided her guidance from the sidelines, the players themslves have begun to increasingly take leadership roles on the field for Harvard.
“One of the things [the coaches] stressed during the spring season was smart decision-making based on what was going on during the game, and having players on the field be leaders making the decisions,” Machado said.
While the early exit from nationals was a somewhat disappointing end to an otherwise breakout season for Harvard, the Crimson has much to look forward to when the team reconvenes in August for its second time around the block.
While all of Harvard’s current players walked on to the squad, the Crimson will welcome the addition of experienced rugby recruits to its roster for next year’s campaign. The team hopes this will soften the blow of losing nine seniors, many of whom have been significant contributors to the team’s success for the past four years.
“The season we had this year—not so much the record, but the way people worked and the attitude that people have approached it with—has set a really solid foundation for a varsity rugby program that will continue to be competitive and dominant many years in the future,” Brown said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A double team, a read-option, a designed rollout. On its first three plays of the game, the Holy Cross football team did everything it could to keep the ball away from Harvard junior defensive end Zach Hodges on Oct. 5.
It didn’t work. 
The 6’3”, 235-pound force finished the game, a 41-35 Crimson victory, with five tackles, a sack, two tackles for loss, a forced fumble, and a fumble recovery. He even recorded a pass breakup. The Crusaders did all they could to run away from Hodges, but they just couldn’t hide.
Hodges made his impact early on this season, starting with a fumble return for a touchdown in a 42-20 win over San Diego to start the year.
“We knew it was going to be a fight,” Hodges said after the game. “We like a fight.”
The Harvard football team might be the only party that enjoys being in a fight involving Hodges.
Hodges’ five-game sack streak was snapped against Princeton, as Ivy League teams who had learned their lesson in past years paid even closer attention to the pass rusher. Even though Hodges was kept relatively quiet over the final five games, the conference’s coaches still rewarded him with Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year honors in December.
“To even be mentioned is all I came here expecting,” Hodges said after the presentation.
Incoming Crimson captain Norman Hayes added that Hodges was never frustrated by the lengths that offenses went to in order to keep him away from the action.
“I don’t think he has any...trouble with the double teams and the schemes against him,” Hayes said.
Hodges helped the Harvard defense hold opponents to an Ivy-low 97 rushing yards per game. The Crimson also led the league in both forced fumbles and interceptions, thanks in large part to Hodges’ relentless pressure, on its way to reclaiming a share of the Ancient Eight title.
The threat of Hodges on the outside also made things a little easier for senior defensive tackle Nnamdi Obukwelu, who tallied 4.5 sacks on the year, second to Hodges’ 6.5. Obukwelu is now a member of the Indianapolis Colts, and in his absence Hodges will likely be given even more attention by opponents in 2014.

Just over one year ago, the Harvard women’s golf team outpaced the rest of the field to win its second straight Ivy League title. And while there were only five Crimson women on the squad for the 2012-2013 season, it looked as though the group would be hard pressed to top its growing list of accomplishments.
But with all five veteran golfers returning this past fall and the addition of two solid recruits, Harvard managed to do just that. Beginning with a 12-stroke win at the Princeton Invitational in September, the Crimson won five of the eight events during the fall and spring.
The team also further cemented its status at the top of the Ancient Eight with its third consecutive Ivy League title and among the elite of Division I golf programs with a Harvard-best 13th-place finish at the NCAA Division I Central Regional in Stillwater, Okla.
Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads voiced his happiness with his team’s performance in his ninth year at the helm and pointed to the stellar play of Ivy League Rookie of the Year Anne Cheng in particular as the driver of its success.
“I think we were deeper than even last year when we were really good,” Rhoads said. “I thought Anne’s year exceeded expectations…. Having that in addition to the already strong [returning] team was great.”
Not only were Cheng’s consistent performances impressive at the Ivy League level, but also her 74.32 score average was just outside the top 100 in the nation. She had five rounds out of 22 at par or better, and had five top-five finishes on the year. Cheng also set the Harvard record for lowest scoring average for an entire year, beating teammate Tiffany Lim’s 2011-2012 average of 75.45 by over a stroke.
The freshman saved the best for last, finishing at the top of the leaderboard at the Ivy League Championships and tied for 10th at the NCAA Central Regional en route to attaining Ivy League Rookie of the Year honors.
“[Cheng] in some ways grew into herself, but it was more for her about adjusting to balance school, travel, and the team, as well as college golf versus high school golf,” Rhoads said. “All facets of her game are strong—she’s a really good ball striker and she’s very consistent.”
Lim matched Cheng’s two tournament wins and nabbed a second-place finish of her own after a middling sophomore campaign that didn’t yield a top finish and saw her average score rise over three strokes.
The San Jose, Calif., native had the Crimson’s top single round of the season with a 66 at the Princeton Invitational in Harvard’s first competition of the year. Her six-under-par day was the best of the field by four strokes, and Lim would ride her stellar start to a three-stroke tournament win. Lim also shot 11-over-par over three rounds at the Ivy League Championships in April, which was good enough to tie for fourth.
Held at Baltusrol Golf Club in Springfield Township, N.J., the conference-deciding event saw four of the five Crimson golfers finish in the top seven. Following Cheng and Lim, captain Bonnie Hu and sophomore Christine Lin tied for seventh for the three days.
“I think this was a really good tournament, but we had a very good year in general,” Lin said. “Coming this close to qualifying for nationals motivates us even more and basically proves to ourselves that we are as good as any other team out there.”
Lin came away with a share of the top spot at the Claremont Mudd Scripps vs. Harvard event over spring break, tying sophomore teammate Courtney Hooton at one-under-par. Just a stroke behind, Hu took home a third-place finish.
Though she did not compete in the postseason, Hooton had a strong spring season, earning the top spot at the CMS vs. Crimson event, a ninth-place finish at the Rebel Intercollegiate tournament, and a spot just outside the top three at the Brown Bear Invitational.
Junior Brenna Nelsen, who is also a Crimson sports executive, only competed in three spring tournaments, but still managed to pick up a second-place finish at the Brown Bear Invitational with a 14-over-par mark. Also appearing in only a few events, freshman Nina Fairbairn shot a 163 at Providence, R.I., which was good enough to tie for 13th.
In another sign of the Crimson’s recent rise to the top of the conference, the current Harvard women hold 12 of the 15 lowest single-season scoring averages in program history.

The Harvard football team had a running back problem.
Entering the 2013 season, the Crimson had graduated first team All-Ivy halfback Treavor Scales ’13, one of the top backs in program history. And in the first game of the fall against San Diego, sophomore Zach Boden went down with a knee injury that would sideline him for the rest of the year.
In this position of need, Harvard turned to sophomore Paul Stanton, and the running back more than just stepped up. For the rest of the year, Stanton served as the Crimson’s go-to runner out of the backfield, averaging nearly 95 yards per game while racking up 17 touchdowns.
“Stanton definitely had a breakout year,” incoming captain Norman Hayes said. “He is an incredible running back and a great teammate all around, but I don’t think anyone was surprised by that. Everybody knows how much potential he has.”
In his freshman campaign, Stanton carried the ball just three times per game. But his reps and production skyrocketed in 2013, and Stanton was named to the All-Ivy second team after finishing second in the conference in touchdowns and fourth in all-purpose yards.
Consistency may have been Stanton’s most valuable asset, as he appeared in every game and scored a touchdown in every matchup except one. However, it just so happened that the sophomore rushed for a season-high 146 yards in that game—including a 63-yard dash down the sideline—to help Harvard notch a 24-21 victory over Dartmouth. Yet what Crimson fans likely remember most vividly about Stanton was his dominant, four-touchdown performance against Yale.
Stanton found the end zone on each of Harvard’s first four drives, with two scores coming on rushes and the other pair on screen passes. As a result of Stanton’s efforts—aided by some timely blocks up front—The Game was effectively over after two quarters.
“That was a great experience,” Stanton said. “I’ve never played in front of that many people, and to be able to play that well in that game was an amazing feeling, to be able to do that for my team.”
Entering last fall, Harvard was searching for answers out of the backfield. Stanton emerged not just as a fill-in, but as a force to be reckoned with. If the Crimson has its way, the rising junior will continue to run wild out of the backfield for the next two seasons.
“Based on the premise that Paul was only a sophomore last year, our expectations are for him to take the next step,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “He’s a terrific player…. He’s one of the guys who can make something out of nothing. The guy you’ve got to contain because he can take it to the house on every play.”

When the Harvard men’s golf team stepped up to the tees at the Princeton Invitational in April, almost five years had passed since the Crimson had last recorded a tournament victory. But after shooting a 20-under 832 as a team—a new program-best score relative to par—Harvard cemented its status as a threat in the Ivy League.
After posting just one top-five finish last season, the Crimson surprised the conference with seven such finishes in its 2013-2014 campaign. Six times the team finished in the top three.
“The guys really [increased] their work ethic and their work level to new places every year,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “So it’s not surprising that it showed with some really nice results, especially in the spring, [when] we got our level to a really great place.”
After finishing atop the leaderboard at Princeton, the Crimson built an early 15-stroke lead one week later at the Yale Invitational and coasted to its second consecutive win.
These two victories marked the first time since the 2008-2009 season that Harvard had earned two wins in the same season. These results also included two outstanding individual performances.
At Princeton, junior Akash Mirchandani finished atop the leaderboard—the first time an individual had won a championship for the Crimson in three years. He shot an eight-under 205, edging out freshman teammate Robert Deng for first by one stroke.
At Yale, competing as an individual, sophomore Rohan Ramnath notched his first individual win in his college career. After a mediocre five-over-par performance in the opening round, the sophomore played some of his best golf in the second round of the day, shooting six-under and surging to the top of the pack.
“We have really good talent on this team,” Rhoads said. “Akash is a really good talent, and as a sophomore, Rohan…has a huge work ethic.”
Coming off two consecutive wins, the Crimson entered the Ivy League Championships as one of the favorites. Harvard led the field after the first round with a 299, but was stifled by a remarkable second-round performance by Columbia, as the Lions shot a 276 en route to the conference title. Yale edged out Harvard by two strokes to take second with an 893, leaving the Crimson with a third-place finish.
But Harvard did not leave the tournament empty-handed. Captain Theo Lederhausen shot a five-over 215 and became the first member of the Crimson to capture the individual Ancient Eight crown since 1998. The senior was consistent all throughout the weekend, shooting a 72 in the first two rounds before closing with a 71.
“He had the spring you hope every senior can have,” Rhoads said. “He finished no worse than 10th in every tournament, punctuating it with winning at Ivies. That’s a strong career.”
The victory for Lederhausen was enough to send the captain to the NCAA Regional tournament, in which Lederhausen finished 61st in the 75-player field, shooting a 232 over three rounds. His best round came in Saturday’s finale, as he capped his collegitae career with a three-over 75.
The spring season was one of Harvard’s all-time best, as the team earned five out of a possible six team and individual wins over its last three tournaments.
“We talk about it all the time that the focus is on the process, and the outcome takes care of itself,” Rhoads said. “That’s nice to say when you’re not getting results...but once you start to get results thinking about things that way, people start to buy in more and more.”
In the fall, aside from one slip-up at the Windon Memorial Classic, in which the team finished 15th out of 16 teams, the Crimson also had success. Harvard opened the year with a second place finish at the Doc Gimmler Invitational at St. John’s. The team also tied for fourth at the Temple Invitational and grabbed second place at Ivy League Match Play.
The Crimson will lose Lederhausen along with fellow seniors Seiji Liu and Kevin McCarthy to graduation, but Rhoads will have the majority of his core back next year. Mirchandani will be the only senior on the squad next season.
“We are strong, young, and deep,” Rhoads said. “I have a lot of confidence in where we’re going moving forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Freshman Anne Cheng was on the green of the 54th hole of the Ivy League Championships when her normal routine was altered by a stray bug that had wandered into her putting line. A crowd of almost a hundred players and spectators had gathered to watch the leader group play out the final hole of the Ancient Eight championships, and Cheng entered the final hole of play with a five-shot lead over the field.
Befitting of her calm and kind demeanor, instead of hitting or squishing the creature, Cheng gently nudged it out of harm’s way and went right back to work as if nothing had happened, putting out to seal the victory.
While you may never guess it from her outward behavior, this year’s Ivy League Rookie of the Year has the killer instincts and skills on the course that have enabled her to gain the respect of her teammates and competitors.
“Her head is incredible,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “She’s unfazed by anything that’s going on around her—good shots or the occasional bad shot. Her game is built to do well and to do well consistently.”
Cheng came out of the gate solidly with a tied-for-fourth-place finish at the Princeton Invitational.
The freshman followed that up a few weeks later with her first collegiate victory at the Harvard Invitational, notching a two-round score of one-over 143.
While her 10th-place performance at the NCAA Division I Central Regional—her seventh top-10 finish in eight tournaments—may have been impressive, it was a five-stroke win at the Ivy League Championships that was the highlight of her season.
“I’m sure Anne was very excited to win, but she didn’t show it as much as we did,” sophomore teammate Christine Lin said. “She’s just very humble, and we all know that she was really happy inside, and we were definitely yelling and screaming at her when she won.”
But it’s not just the freshman’s ability with the club that sets Cheng apart from the crowd.
One moment, she is Anne Cheng, the Harvard student, studying Chinese before her final-round early morning tee time at regionals, and the next minute, she is Anne Cheng, the Crimson golf star, shooting a 74 in those last 18 holes to finish tied for 10th in the tournament.
The Torrance, Calif., native was also recently recognized for her attitude and support off the golf course when she was granted Harvard golf’s Warren Smith Sportsmanship Award.
“As soon as her own shot is over, she can let it go, and in those moments, she tends to ask how everyone else is doing,” Rhoads said. “Yes, she was excited to do well individually, but again, her thoughts always go back to the team and to what’s best for it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The stakes were high and the battle was tense. On Oct. 26, the undefeated Harvard and Princeton football teams faced off in Cambridge, with the winner earning the driver’s seat in the race for an Ivy League championship.
The showdown featured nearly a thousand yards of offense, close to 100 total points scored, and lasted just under four hours.
But at the end of the day, the lasting image was the Princeton team mobbing wide receiver Roman Wilson after he reeled in a game-winning touchdown pass from quarterback Quinn Epperly in triple overtime to secure a 51-48 Tigers victory.
“It was definitely an exciting game,” captain Norman Hayes said. “It took a lot of heart from both sides just to play for as long as we did. They ended up making that last play, and we kind of fell short. But it was a great game nonetheless.”
The game was compelling from start to finish. Twice during the second half, Princeton jumped out to a seven-point lead after Epperly touchdown passes. When the Tigers seized a 35-28 advantage and picked off Harvard quarterback Conner Hempel with under five minutes to play, Princeton appeared to be in firm control.
But senior cornerback Brian Owusu saved the day for the Crimson, forcing a fumble that was recovered by Harvard. Three plays later, Hempel found senior tight end Tyler Ott in the end zone to tie the game.
The back-and-forth play continued in overtime, when the two teams traded touchdowns in the first extra period. After Princeton settled for a field goal on its second possession, junior kicker Andrew Flesher converted an important 38-yarder of his own to extend the game.
But Harvard’s luck ran out there. After another Crimson field goal, the Tigers needed just three plays for Epperly to connect with Wilson in the back corner of the end zone to win the game and silence the Harvard faithful. 
The Crimson no doubt had flashbacks to the prior season—in the 2012 Harvard-Princeton meeting, Epperly found Wilson for a 36-yard touchdown with 13 seconds remaining to complete a 29-point fourth-quarter Tigers comeback.
“If you look at the games the last four years against [Princeton], we’ve not only had a hard time stopping them, we’ve had a hard time even slowing them down,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “One of my priorities for our defense this year is to find a way to stop Princeton, find a way to slow them down.”
While the game provided an exciting narrative, the statistics were perhaps even more compelling. By the day’s end, Epperly had thrown for a Princeton-record six touchdowns, and Hempel posted four TDs of his own. Crimson senior wide receiver Ricky Zorn amassed a career-high 168 yards in the air, and time of possession was almost dead even.
“That was a very devastating loss for us,” said sophomore running back Paul Stanton. “We lost to them the year before at the very end too, and we know that this year we can’t let that happen again. We can’t take the pedal off.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tied at halftime in its game against then-No. 2 Cornell, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team turned a corner and essentially started a new season.
It was one of the greatest second halves in program history.
The Crimson went on a 6-1 run in the third quarter and, ultimately, held on to beat the Big Red, taking sole possession of the top spot in the Ivy League after early nonconference losses to UMass, Albany, UNC, and Duke.
After the Cornell game, Harvard went on a tear, winning three of its next four games, including victories against ranked conference opponents Princeton and Yale. Its only loss came against 11th-ranked Penn in overtime on the road in Philadelphia.
The Crimson won its first regular season conference title since 1990 and went into the Ivy League tournament as the top seed and host, needing to win it to guarantee itself a berth in the NCAA Tournament. Harvard’s résumé was strong after its recent wins, but the early losses made its chances of receiving an at-large bid to the tournament more tenuous.
“Winning the championship for the first time in 24 years was a huge accomplishment,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “The league was very strong this year, and I am very proud of what we did.”
In the first round of the conference tournament, the Crimson challenged Yale and won by a single goal for the second time in two weeks over the Bulldogs. However, it lost to Penn again in the final.
Harvard was then forced to await the NCAA Selection Committee’s decision with trepidation, not knowing if its losses would come back to haunt it.
Finally, at the very end of the selection show, the Crimson found out that it would receive the final at-large bid to the tournament and would play against Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind. This was the first time that Harvard had been to the national tournament since 2006. The team ultimately struggled against the Irish and lost, 13-5, in a game that it never led in.
“Our guys got a taste of what it is going to take to win at an elite level,” Wojcik said. “It is a building process to being able to win late in May, but the experience from this year is going to be big for us.”
Harvard’s leadership came primarily from its senior class, headlined by co-captains Peter Schwartz and Joe Petrucci. Schwartz, a midfielder, finished with the second-most points on the team and was named second team All-Ivy, while Petrucci anchored the Harvard defense throughout the season.
“Finishing our careers as Ivy League champions is really special,” Petrucci said. “It has been a lot of work over the last four years to get to this point, and to finally see it all pay off is a really great feeling.”
However, a large portion of the Crimson’s talent is concentrated in its younger classes.
Sophomores Devin Dwyer and Bobby Duvnjak were both named first team All-Ivy. Dwyer missed the first four games of the season, including the Albany and UMass defeats, but still managed to lead the team in points. His 35 assists were the most in the Ivy League, with the second-highest being just 23. Duvnjak ranked second on the team in turnovers forced and was a key component of the Harvard defense all season.
Rounding out Harvard’s All-Ivy selections were junior goaltender Jake Gambitsky, sophomore defenseman Stephen Jahelka, sophomore attackman Will Walker, and senior midfielder Carl Zimmerman.
“Coming into the season, we felt disrespected in the league,” Petrucci said. “No one really expected us to finish first and have a great season like that. Instead, we went out and proved everyone wrong.”
Next year, with many of the key contributors from this team returning, the Crimson will no longer be regarded as an unlikely candidate to win the Ivy League. Harvard has emerged as a potential force to be reckoned within the scope of national collegiate lacrosse.
“We took a big step forward for the program this year,” Wojcik said. “But our guys still finished the season yearning for more. We had a lot of success in the conference, but we still need to take big steps to win at the national tournament level. Next year, we have to be even better and even hungrier.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a season filled with triple-overtime games, nail-biting victories and defeats, and last-second field goals, what was perhaps the most crucial game for the Harvard football team was not even played by the Crimson.
Hours after Harvard (9-1, 6-1 Ivy), fueled by four touchdowns from sophomore running back Paul Stanton, claimed victory in the 130th playing of The Game, Crimson coach Tim Murphy received some unexpected news.
“We’re on the ride home, and I’m not even thinking about the Dartmouth game, but it’s eerily quiet on the offensive bus,” Murphy said. “[Junior tight end] Tyler Hamblin, who’s a very respected kid on the team, comes shuffling down the aisle and says, ‘Coach Murphy, Dartmouth’s up by five with five minutes to go in the game,’ and I go, ‘I don’t want to hear it.’”
In the final Ivy League matchup of the season, the Big Green was locked in a battle with Princeton, the Ancient Eight leader. With a Princeton victory, the Tigers would lock up sole ownership of the title. With a Dartmouth win, the Crimson would snag a share of the title.
“About five minutes later, kids are pushing [Hamblin] up the aisle, and he’s saying ‘I don’t want to talk to him,’” Murphy said. “[Hamblin] says, ‘Coach, Dartmouth just intercepted the ball with 30 seconds left and Princeton has no timeouts.’ I say, ‘Is that what I think it means?’ Tyler goes, ‘Yeah coach, we just won the Ivy League Championship.’”
With how dominant Princeton had been throughout league play—undefeated to that point—a Tigers championship had appeared to be the foregone conclusion. But on a snowy night in Hanover, the Tigers faltered, and the result was a Harvard football team that had double the reason to dance in the streets of New Haven that night.
“Beating Dartmouth and having them beat Princeton was probably the greatest feeling ever,” Stanton said. “We knew that [Dartmouth] had a chance because of how close the game was with us and we knew that they were a great team…. When they did that it was probably the happiest moment of most of our lives.”
Princeton, which handed the Crimson one of its two losses the previous season, was responsible for the only blemish on Harvard’s otherwise undefeated 2013 record. In its second triple-overtime game of the season, the Crimson had a chance to take the lead with just over a minute left in regulation, but junior kicker Andrew Flesher’s ball sailed wide left from 50 yards out, and the teams headed to overtime.
On second and goal in triple overtime, Tigers quarterback Quinn Epperly found wide receiver Roman Wilson—the same duo that connected for the game-winning touchdown a year ago—in the back of the end zone to conclude the game. The loss knocked the Crimson out of first place in the Ancient Eight, giving Princeton complete control of its title destiny.
A week later, the Crimson found itself in another tight battle when it faced Dartmouth. Flesher redeemed himself, hitting a field goal with under a minute to play, and senior cornerback Jaron Wilson grabbed the game-clinching interception in a contest that would prove to have significant title implications.
“Dartmouth’s as good as anybody,” Murphy said. “They’re a couple plays away from having won the whole thing, too. When you consider it, they’ve beaten Princeton two years in a row. When you consider it, we had to make a fingertip catch on a double reverse pass down in the far end zone to win the game, plus a game-winning field goal. They’re legit.”
Though the Crimson notched a win in almost all of its games, the success was preceded by uncertainty heading into the season.
The 2012 team graduated many key offensive players, including quarterback Colton Chapple and tailback Treavor Scales. After wavering between senior Michael Pruneau and junior Conner Hempel for much of the preseason, Murphy named Hempel as starting quarterback before the first game.
But when Hempel was sidelined halfway through the season with a knee injury, Pruneau filled in, leading the team to victories against Cornell and Lafayette. The transition back was smooth, however. Hempel returned the following week to throw for four scores against Princeton.
Stanton, who filled the starting running back spot left by Scales, proved to be one of the biggest surprises of the season, rivaling Scales’ senior year statistics. The sophomore rushed for 936 yards and 15 touchdowns, and notched another two touchdowns in The Game off of Hempel passes.
“A year ago, you look at all the impact players we lost and you wonder, ‘How are we going to replace this guy, and this guy?’” Murphy said. “There were a lot of really pleasant surprises, which is kind of the identity you have as a championship-caliber team year in, year out—the tendency for guys to step up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After back surgery in the August prior to his junior year, Jake Gambitsky returned to the Harvard men’s lacrosse team before the 2014 season as a better goaltender and a better leader.
“I really think his technique has improved,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “Adam Ghitelman has done a great job coaching Jake and all of the goalies…. When you combine his improving on some of the finer points with his increased confidence, I think that makes him a great goalie now.”
 Gambitsky began his career at Harvard strongly. As a rookie, he appeared in nine games, serving as a starter in seven. The then-freshman made 74 saves in his first year of collegiate play.
 “As a goalie, you are definitely humbled coming into college,” Gambitsky said. “It is easier to succeed in high school as a goalie, when the shots are slower and the attackers aren’t as strong.”
 The following year for Gambitsky proved more difficult than his first. As a sophomore, he appeared in just two games, serving as backup to then-senior Harry Krieger.
 “[In my] sophomore year, play time was rocky at times,” Gambitsky said. “I had Harry Krieger in front of me…. I kind of learned under him last year a lot. It was great to see how his playing style compared to mine. I tried to take things out of his game and influence them into my own.”
This year, however, Gambitsky served as the sole starting goalie for the Crimson. Under the coaching of Ghitelman and using the techniques he learned from watching Krieger, Gambitsky ranked 28th in the nation for goals against average.
 The junior let just 9.87 shots per game pass him on average, and was named second team All-Ivy.
 “I think we have one of the best defensive units in the country ,” Gambitsky said.
“[Co-captain] Joe Petrucci, [sophomore Stephen] Jahelka, and [sophomore Bobby] Duvnjak down low are all protecting me and are aggressive guys,” Gambitsky said. “They definitely give me the opportunity to make saves I want to make.”
 But a big part of Gambitsky’s job description as goalie is to direct his defense to guard the formidable attackers Harvard faced all year. Thanks to both his ability to communicate and talent for stonewalling the opposing offense, Gambitsky was voted as one of the captains for the upcoming season.
 “I think that one thing we saw with Jake this year, too, was his improved communication, which is really important for a goalie,” Wojcik said. “It is actually a skill in lacrosse to be able to effectively communicate, which will no doubt help carry over to his role as captain.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To Maura Crowell, it’s a little like “riding a bike.” Taking over one of the most acclaimed college women’s ice hockey programs in the nation may not have been entirely shocking, but it certainly carried a new set of expectations and pressures.
 This past season, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team earned 23 wins, an Ivy League title, and an at-large berth to the NCAA Tournament. Nearly every day, the Crimson laced up at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center and trained as the team has done since its inaugural season in 1978.
 Yet, while Katey Stone may remain the Landry Family Head Coach for Harvard Women’s Ice Hockey—the post she has held for the past 20 years—it was Crowell who manned the ship at the Bright, acting as interim coach this year and coaching a barebones Crimson lineup of just 18 skaters.
 While Stone was announced as the coach of the USA Olympic women’s team in July 2012, Crowell, who came to Harvard in 2009 after coaching UMass Boston, was not named her temporary replacement until around nine months later.
 “It wasn’t a huge surprise to us that [Stone] was going to be named the Olympic coach,” Crowell said. “We were really excited for her and for the program…. We had talked for years about my taking over the program and what that would look like.”
 Few transitions are seamless, but Crowell took over after plenty of preparation and with sufficient leadership and the support of the players on the team.
 As Stone left the Bright for the USA Hockey Selection camp, Crowell assumed control of the small but talented squad with plenty of faith from her predecessor.
 Having already been in Cambridge for three years, Crowell was well adapted to the style of play, which Stone has used for decades at Harvard, that has brought the team consistent national acclaim.
“Maura’s attention to detail and hard-nosed approach to a game are similar [to mine]; it’s one of the reasons I think we get along so well,” said Stone at the start of the season. “She believes in the details of the game and that the little things matter.”
 With the graduation of several key players—starting goaltender Laura Bellamy ’13 and leading scorer Jillian Dempsey ’13—and the Olympic departures of Lyndsey Fry, Michelle Picard, and Josephine Pucci, Crowell began the school year knowing it was back to square one.
 Just a couple of weeks into September, the roster thinned even more as two players, including co-captain Kalley Armstrong, withdrew from the team because of season-ending injuries. 
 Without Armstrong, who was a top-scoring forward intended to share captain duties with  junior defender Marissa Gedman, Crowell was left with a team consisting mainly of underclassmen that returned just one of the previous season’s top-five scoring players.
 “When we had our opening meeting, what we talked about with the players was that we can’t focus on who’s not in the locker room,” Crowell said. “This is about who is in the locker room.”
 And the locker room had plenty of talent. Crowell, who had watched much of the team since they were still high schoolers, was tasked with the job of turning rookies into starters who were ready to contend with formidable ECAC opponents.
 “Whether they were experienced or not, we had a ton of freshmen, and a lot of them came from winning programs, and that’s really important in building a successful team,” Crowell said. “It’s having kids who really know how to win and what it takes to win and believe that they can win.”
 And thus, Crowell’s transition was not just one of individual and personal change, but more reflective of an era of transformation on the team itself.
 Despite all that Crowell had to contend with—a new position, a depleted roster—success came quickly to the Crimson as it opened its season with consecutive wins over preseason-favorite Quinnipiac and Ivy-rival Princeton.
 “To beat [Quinnipiac] and to turn around and beat Princeton when giving up close to 90 shots over that weekend was kind of a statement,” Crowell said. “I was thinking, ‘Okay, we have something here.’”
 The wins kept coming. The team lost just once between October and December, and beat eventual national champion Clarkson on the road in Potsdam, N.Y. Amidst the shifting lines, Crowell showed why she was the winningest coach in UMass Boston history. Players and coach alike were confident in the change occurring.
 “It wasn’t an easy transition, obviously,” sophomore forward Miye D’Oench said. “She was cool and collected the whole time. She filled that role really well.”
 Meanwhile, to Crowell, despite the shifts from being a Division III head coach to an assistant coach at Harvard to eventually running the Crimson program, certain concepts have remained consistent no matter what position she held or school she coached at.
 “I still think a lot of it is just coaching, relationship building with players, [and] communication,” Crowell said. “A lot of those same themes carry over no matter where you’re coaching, but I’d say the expectations and the exposure are 10 times bigger here [at Harvard].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sophomore Devin Dwyer of the Harvard men’s lacrosse team came into the 2014 campaign as the reigning All-New England Rookie of the Year. Despite the target on his back, the attackman only gotten better this season, despite teams focusing their defenses on stopping him.
“Teams are going to start getting out on him and try to eliminate his ability to feed,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “We already saw that a lot this season.”
However, Dwyer was unfazed by defensive attempts to cut off his passing game. Despite an injury that sidelined him for the first four games of the season, the sophomore still led the team in assists.
“Once he came back later in the season, that really helped bring up our offensive production,” co-captain Peter Schwartz said. “I think that Devin acts as the quarterback for us behind the net [with how he] finds other teammates consistently.”
Dwyer led the Ivy League and finished the season ranked seventh nationally in assists. Appearing in just 13 games, Dwyer dished out 35 assists, averaging 2.69 per game.
“[Dwyer] can see the passing lanes and then execute a really precise pass onto his teammates’ sticks,” Wojcik said. “Because of that, Devin really makes his teammates around him better. It is a special skill set to have that lacrosse IQ, that vision, and execution.”
The top two Crimson scorers, sophomore attack Will Walker and Schwartz, who scored 35 and 25 goals, respectively, received a combined 15 passes from Dwyer that ultimately found the back of the net.
“I think me and Devin had a lot of chemistry on the field,” Schwartz said. “And it only improved throughout the year. It really helps for me as a player to know that if I get to an open space, that I will get the ball—that’s what Devin does.”
In many of Harvard’s close games this year, Dwyer’s passing abilities gave the Crimson the edge it needed to defeat well-matched opponents. In the last game of the regular season, Harvard faced up against Yale on the Bulldogs’ home turf.
On the line against the No. 13 Bulldogs was the Ivy League title. Yale had won the tournament the year before, securing the conference title and the automatic berth in the NCAA tournament.
However, the Crimson eventually topped Yale, 11-10, with six assists from Dwyer. The sophomore assisted sophomore attack Deke Burns to start the scoring and had three assists in the first quarter as Harvard withstood an early Bulldog charge. Four of the team’s first five goals came on assists from Dwyer, who also assisted on classmate attack Sean McDonagh’s goal with nine minutes to go that pushed the lead to 11-9.
“Though it’s an overall team effort. We were able to draw slides and get the ball to him,” Wojcik said. “Devin is clearly a crucial element of our offense, and his passes tipped the scale our way.”
One week following the game that clinched the Ivy League title for Harvard, the Crimson came up against the Bulldogs again in Ancient Eight tournament play. Harvard topped Yale, 10-9, and again Dwyer proved essential, contributing five assists on the night.
“If [the Crimson is] going to be successful in upcoming years,” Schwartz said. “Devin is going to have continue to get better and have more of a leadership role. The sky is the limit for him.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In college women’s ice hockey, 21 players are allowed to dress for a game in which skaters fluidly hop the rink barrier to sub in and out regularly. Twenty-one players are expected to fill each team’s bench, ready to assume the ice and compete instantly.
 This past season, just 18 Crimson players and their interim coach, Maura Crowell, called the Bright-Landry Hockey Center home. Three under the normal roster size, there was no room for injury or inefficiency. And few missteps were taken, as a team depleted by graduation, the Olympics, and health-related departures contended for the ECAC title and finished the season 23-7-4, just one win short of its 2012-2013 total.
“It’s about us,” Crowell said. “This 18. This small team of 18. That’s all it’s about, and no one else is coming in the door to help us out. No one else is going to feel bad for us this year.”
For the first time since the 1993-1994 season, Katey Stone was not at the helm of Harvard women’s ice hockey, temporarily leaving her post to coach Team USA in its preparations for and competition in the Sochi Olympics. As Stone and a quintet of Crimson current or former players trained for international contests, a Harvard squad faced its situation—the absence of four of the five top scorers from the previous year and one of two contributing goalies.
 With a notable personnel deficit, a new cast of characters came to the frontlines to keep Harvard consistently ranked in the top 10 nationally. Sophomore Miye D’Oench doubled her offensive production, while classmate Emerance Maschmeyer continued to defend the goal, posting the second-highest save percentage in the league through the season’s end. 
Youth propelled the team, with just six players in their second half of college.
 Still, veterans like junior Marissa Gedman, the team’s sole captain this year who took off the 2012-2013 season due to a ruptured Achilles tendon, provided experience on defense, while forwards Hillary Crowe, Samantha Reber and Gina McDonald continued to pack an offensive punch.
 Lack of experience did not seem to be a problem for the team as it suffered just four regular-season losses, notched eight total shutouts, and played the middle portion of its schedule, from Nov. 2 to Jan. 10, undefeated.
 From the official season opener against Quinnipiac to the closing game at Wisconsin, the Crimson played a barrage of talented opponents. Victories over highly-ranked teams landed the squad toward the top of the ECAC for much of the season.
 Wins and losses ranged from 5-0 shutouts to double-overtime dramas, with some providing career-best performances or program superlatives. Maschmeyer notched a personal record of 51 saves during an overtime tie against Boston College on Dec. 7. 
 For the first time since the 2008-2009 season, Harvard beat Cornell at Lynah Rink in Ithaca on Jan. 13 as the then-No. 5/6 Crimson topped the then-No. 3 Big Red, 3-1, for sole possession of the top spot in the ECAC.
 “All season people have talked about the adversity we faced, but the confidence in ourselves is unwavering,” said Gedman after the Cornell win. “Now people are seeing the teams we are beating and they are starting to respect us as much as we respect ourselves.”
 Despite regular-season success, playoff wins were harder to come by for Crowell’s team. Two double-overtime nailbiters against Yale in the ECAC quarterfinals nearly denied the Crimson a trip to the semis, in which the squad fell to Cornell’s comeback effort in the third period. And while the team received an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament, it was unable to upset fourth-seeded Wisconsin for a spot in the Frozen Four.
 If a shortage of bodies was a problem this year, it will certainly be the opposite next year, when Stone returns and brings with her Lyndsey Fry, Josephine Pucci, and Michelle Picard, all members of Team USA. Pucci and Picard will share captain responsibilities with senior Kalley Armstrong, who took this past season off due to concussion-related symptoms.
 “It’s going to be a much bigger team, so that’s going to be interesting going from 18 to about 26,” Crowell said. “But that’s a good thing. There were times this year when we started games with 14 or 15, and it’s very difficult to compete at the D1 level with that few bodies on a roster.”
 The team will expand back to a normally sized roster, full of Olympians, breakout stars, and highly-touted recruits.
 “It’s going to be great,” Crowell said. “It’s going to increase the competitiveness at practice every day. It’s going to be battling for ice time and with that brings good things and it also brings challenges. We have what we think are all of the pieces of the puzzle here lined up really well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off of a 2013 season that saw the team win just three games, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team improved its record greatly in 2014, going 9-7 and gaining a berth in the Ivy League Tournament for the first time in two years.
One of the key differences between the schedules in 2013 and 2014 was the number of home games that the Crimson played. Last year, Harvard competed in front of its home crowd in just three of its 14 contests. But this season, eight of the team’s 16 games took place on Soldiers Field or at Harvard Stadium.
The first half of the campaign saw the team struggle against top-20 teams such as Stanford, Penn, Syracuse, and Boston College. The team’s loss to Princeton on April 12 was the first time that Harvard fell to an unranked team, going down, 15-6, in a pivotal game at home.
In regular season conference play, the Crimson ended the year narrowly above .500, going 4-3 against opponents in the Ancient Eight. The team was able to counter losses to Penn, Princeton, and Dartmouth with wins against Cornell, Yale, Brown, and Columbia.
The team’s success garnered a top-four spot in the conference and a bid to the Ivy League Tournament, in which Harvard was matched up with Penn once again. Unlike the previous contest between the two teams—when the Crimson fell, 9-4—the tournament game stretched into double overtime, but Harvard ultimately went down, 10-9, after almost two hours of lacrosse.
The competitive manner in which the season concluded served as proof of how far the team came in one year.
“That was honestly the best way [the season could have ended],” co-captain Chelsey Newman said. “Staying competitive in that game against a team that we haven’t had the best success [against] gives the team a lot of hope for when they play them again next year.”
Newman was among the three seniors graduating from the team this season, along with fellow co-captain Kyleigh Keating and attacker Chloe Soukas. Together, the seniors contributed 22 points and 18 goals.
However, it was the underclassmen who stole the show this year. Freshman attacker Marisa Romeo led the Crimson in scoring for the first four games of the season, scoring as many as five goals during the course of one game. Romeo ended the year with a league-leading 48 goals, amassing 58 points and playing all 16 games of the season.
Sophomore attacker Audrey Todd  showed great improvement from freshman year and ended the campaign with 29 goals and 36 points. Todd had a hat trick in three consecutive contests and led Harvard with 38 draw controls on her way to being named to the All-Ivy first team for the second year in a row.
One of the team’s major goals coming into the season was to improve the number of draw controls the squad won each game. By doing so, Harvard could have the opportunity to take the advantage in possession minutes, potentially leading to more scoring drives.
The team was able to maintain its consistency despite facing injuries and adversity throughout the season.
After a knee injury sidelined freshman midfielder Maeve McMahon, classmate Megan Hennessey was called from attacker to play at midfield. She stepped up to the challenge, scoring 23 goals on year.
The balance that the offense brought to the field each game allowed there to be many scoring options that opposing defenses struggled to defend.
“Everyone thought that we were a really young team, and we were,” Newman said. “But we needed to prove that it was going to help us on the field.”
Throughout the season, the squad focused on maintaining physicality each game in order to stay competitive against every opponent.
“Everyone was set on overcoming all of the challenges that we faced throughout the year,” Newman said. “I think making it to the tournament was a huge accomplishment that will be a great stepping stone and a great experience for the young players going into next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Heading into its 2013-2014 season, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team was already facing an uphill battle.
The Crimson had graduated its leading scorer, Jillian Dempsey ’13, and had lost three other key players along with long-tenured coach, Katey Stone, to the Olympic roster. 
But despite what appeared to be a thin lineup, the Crimson still had a strong season, posting a 23-7-4 record and clinching the Ivy League title.
The loss of personnel left ample room for new leaders to emerge on the ice. Sophomore Miye D’Oench did just that, spearheading Harvard’s offensive production with a team-leading 21 goals and 18 assists on the year.
“Our sophomore class stepped up hugely, especially Miye,” said Harvard interim coach Maura Crowell. “[The sophomores] just stepped into the role, having more experience and more confidence because they were playing a lot more.”
According to Crowell, the added ice time gave the forward a newfound poise, which she carried throughout the season.
“Obviously, she has some sweet hands, and we were able to see that more,” Crowell said. “That comes with confidence, adjusting to the speed of the game, and knowing when you have the time to do it. She’s not afraid to put the puck on the net, and she did a tremendous job on her off-ice strength and conditioning coming into the season, so she was stronger and in better shape.”
The sophomore’s offensive presence was consistent throughout the season, as the forward posted a goal or an assist in 24 of the Crimson’s 34 contests.
“I got to play with some really great players, and we started clicking,” D’Oench said. “We gained some chemistry, that X-factor when you’re on the ice and you know where each other are. That was awesome and really fun to play with people you are very comfortable with.”
D’Oench posted a pair of goals on four separate occasions and netted the game winner in as many contests. She had a knack for coming up big when the Crimson needed her most, including scoring the Crimson’s game-winner in double overtime of an ECAC quarterfinals contest. 
The Crimson faced a one-game deficit in a best-of-three series, but D’Oench’s overtime score in the 84th minute of play forced a third game against the Bulldogs, which the Crimson capitalized on en route to an appearance in the ECAC semifinals.
D’Oench, who was second in the Ivy League in points per game and scored the fourth-most goals in ECAC league play, was named a first team All-Ivy League and third-team All-ECAC selection.
The rising junior will continue to be a strong force for the Crimson offense, which next year returns three players from the Olympic roster and adds a bevy of talented fresh faces from a strong recruiting class.
“We’re going to be really deep and have a lot of competition for ice time,” D’Oench said. “You always want to have a fuller roster and a lot of talent. There’s a lot to be excited for.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It has been a season of adjustments across the river in Newell Boathouse, as both the men’s heavyweight and lightweight teams found themselves getting used to new coaches this year.
After the death of legendary coach Harry Parker on June 25, Harvard was forced to find a new head for the heavyweight program for the first time in over 50 years. The search lasted almost all summer, but in the end the heavies didn’t have to go very far—Charley Butt, the coach of the men’s lightweight program, accepted the heavyweight men’s position after 28 years at the helm of the H-150 crew.
“I’m looking forward to continuing to be able to work with Harvard students,” Butt said in the fall. “I feel like it is my mission to carry on the tradition that is a very competitive, ready-to-race-every-weekend kind of team.”
With the lightweight position now open, the search committee once again hired from within, as lightweight women’s coach Michiel Bartman switched over to coach the men after two years with the Radcliffe rowers.
With only the IRA National Championships and the Harvard-Yale heavyweight regattas remaining on the schedule, the year is nearly over for both crews. In a season of transitions, the No. 3 heavyweights haven’t seemed to miss a beat, with wins in every dual race, while the lightweights have struggled to pull together a fast boat, losing three head-to-head contests after going undefeated for the last two years.
HEAVYWEIGHTS
The Harvard heavies have carried on the winning tradition of Parker this spring, as the first varsity boat followed up an undefeated dual season with a win at Eastern Sprints for the second consecutive year. The team won the inaugural Harry Parker Cup for its victory in the 1V race, which the team won by 1.2 seconds over top-seeded Brown on its way to posting a blistering time of 5:27.27, just .27 seconds off the course record.
The crew also won the Rowe Cup for the highest team point total overall, as the first freshman boat finished second and the 2V finished in fifth. A year after earning a silver medal in the 1V race at IRAs, the team will head into the national championships hoping to continue its perfect season.
Despite beginning the spring slate with very little on-the-water practice time—due to the ice covering the Charles River that just never seemed to melt—the team has not shown any sign of ill effects. The crew began its season with a win over Cornell and followed it up by taking home the Stein, Compton, and Adams Cups with victories over Brown, Princeton and MIT, and Penn, respectively.
The crew also experienced success during the fall regattas and was consistent throughout the year.
“The heavyweight men’s rowing team started out the 2014 season in tremendous fashion,” captain Andy Holmes said. “The seniors led in the fall with two great victories in Oklahoma, starting the year off with a bang. A month later, the whole squad performed exceptionally to post wins at both Head of the Charles Regatta and at Tail of the Charles.”
LIGHTWEIGHTS
After winning the last two IRA National Championships, the lightweight team has struggled in its quest for a three-peat. The Crimson began the season ranked first in the country but faltered in its dual races, losing to Cornell early and then coming up short in its attempt to defend the Goldthwait Cup against Princeton and Yale.
“While we might not have gotten the results that we wanted, I think that the feeling on the team is that if we put our heads down and grind for three weeks, we can come out of it stronger and faster, and that we can show some more speed at Sprints,” junior captain Zander Bonorris said after the HYP race.
However, Harvard could not pull it together to defend its 2013 Sprints title, as the Crimson managed only a fifth place finish in the varsity eight grand final. Not a single Harvard boat came away with a victory in the regatta, as the first freshman boat was upset by Penn.
Despite the losses at Sprints, the Crimson remains focused on its final race of the collegiate season at IRAs in a few weeks.
“As an athlete, it is essential to look to the future and continue on the road to more speed,” Bonorris said. “Looking back rarely helps, and I think that our squad has done a wonderful job of working hard to maximize our boat speed coming into the championship regatta.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What was the high point for the Harvard men’s hockey team this year?
“Good question,” responded rising junior forward and incoming co-captain Kyle Criscuolo. “Um, I’ll have to come back to that one.”
Criscuolo’s hesitation is understandable. The Crimson’s 2013-2014 campaign, which ended in a two-game sweep by Yale in the first round of the ECAC tournament, offered few rivalry victories or memorable upsets.
After placing last in the conference for the first time in program history last year, Harvard finished just one spot better this season, with the same number of wins in the conference (six) and overall (10).
“I think it was just a tough year,” Criscuolo said. “We didn’t score many goals, and that kind of hurt us with a lot of freshmen.”
New excitement surrounded the Crimson program as coach Ted Donato ’91 began his 10th season behind the bench. Harvard welcomed a top-tier recruiting class, promoted a special game with Yale, and prepared for renovations on its rink.
Yet just like the current construction on the Bright-Landry Hockey Center, Donato’s rebuilding plan is not complete.
“I thought that our commitment to defense and our compete-level and effort was there,” Donato said. “I think that we just were an exceptionally young team, and we struggled to score goals.”
Freshman centers Sean Malone and Alexander Kerfoot stepped in  to replace Alex Fallstrom ’13 and Luke Greiner ’13 on the team’s top two lines, where the rookies joined classmate Luke Esposito and sophomores Jimmy Vesey, Brian Hart, and Criscuolo.
Sophomore defensemen Max Everson and Patrick McNally, meanwhile, returned from year-long hiatuses as the Crimson tried to address the graduation of All-American Danny Biega ’13.
On offense, the growing pains were evident. The Crimson averaged 2.23 goals per game—the eighth-lowest in Division I—and Harvard blue-liners combined for only four goals.
Multiple injuries and roster withdrawals placed extra responsibility on the Crimson’s underclassmen as the season progressed. Harvard ran three full lines of freshmen and sophomores for several games in the middle of the season.
Donato feels that the lack of veteran experience on the team’s top lines created a challenging dynamic.
“I think there was, at times, a little bit of a lack of cohesion in leadership throughout the group,” Donato said.
After a promising start that included a comeback tie on the road and a shutout win at home against Rensselaer, Harvard would not string together a pair of back-to-back wins until early February.
In ECAC play, the Crimson compensated partly for its struggles on offense with a highly efficient penalty killing unit and strong goaltending from senior Raphael Girard and sophomore Steve Michalek.
Harvard’s lack of experience, however, proved costly in tight matchups. All eight of the Crimson’s one-goal losses this season came against conference opponents.
“We started out pretty well, and then we were kind of inconsistent,” Criscuolo said. “We didn’t play a full 60 minutes for a lot of the games, I think.”
Harvard and Yale added important chapters to their rivalry this year. On Jan. 11, the Bulldogs cruised to a 5-1 win over Harvard in the first Rivalry On Ice game at Madison Square Garden.
In the first round of the postseason, Yale shut out the Crimson, 4-0, in game one and took game two, 2-1, in a comeback win with two goals 38 seconds apart.
“I think [our games against Yale] will certainly be a point of emphasis next year,” Donato said. “We’d love to return the favor to Yale.”
By game two, Harvard was broken down. Injuries to Esposito, Kerfoot, and other forwards forced the Crimson to fill its fourth line with defensemen. All told, 10 players who were listed on the Crimson’s roster at the beginning of the season were inactive by the closing contest.
In the final weeks of the regular season, however, the team showed signs of progress. In February, the Crimson put together its only winning streak of the season.
During the stretch, the team’s young stars led the way. Vesey scored his league-leading fifth game-winning goal with an overtime clincher at Clarkson on Feb. 14. Meanwhile, Malone, who led the team with 14 assists, registered a five-game point streak.
The coming months will test the 2013-2014 campaign’s legacy as a rebuilding year. Only then will Crimson fans know if the foundation has been set.
“Overall, I think the season had its ups and downs, and it was a frustrating finish,” Donato said. “But I thought that our younger players really had a substantial learning experience and played a lot of important minutes for us, so I think that bodes well for us in the future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s been a successful season so far at Weld Boathouse, as both the women’s heavyweight and lightweight crews head into their respective national championship regattas ranked in the top 20 nationally.
After a difficult start to the season, the Radcliffe heavyweights rallied in the third annual Ivy League Championship to overcome their sixth-place seeding, finishing in third. The result was good enough to earn the 11th-ranked Black and White an at-large bid to the NCAA Championships.
Meanwhile, the departure of coach Michiel Bartman to the lightweight men’s team could not slow down the Radcliffe lightweight women. After an undefeated dual race season, the varsity eight will head into the IRA National Championship as the heavy favorite to win a national title.
HEAVYWEIGHTS
After finishing seventh against the best competition in the country at the Head of the Charles Regatta in the fall, the Black and White stumbled to open up the spring season. The first varsity boat lost three straight races against Ancient Eight competition, as the crew followed a loss to No. 3 Brown in Providence with defeats at the hands of Princeton and Cornell on the Charles a week later.
The team bounced back with wins over local competition, taking the Beanpot over BU and Northeastern,  but once again faltered against an Ivy League opponent in its final race of the dual season. Yale’s top boat bested Radcliffe by five seconds on the Housatonic to win its third straight Case Cup.
After the disappointing effort against Yale, the team chose to focus all their energy on the upcoming Ivy League Championships. Between the two races, the team had almost three weeks of uninterrupted training to regroup.
Coming into the weekend seeded sixth out of eight teams, Radcliffe outpaced its seed and finished third, ahead of both Cornell and Yale. The late-season performances were good enough to earn the No. 12 Black and White the last Ivy League at-large spot in the NCAA Championships in Indianapolis.
“The afternoon was one of those races that as a rower you only get to experience very rarely,” senior Jenna Gregoire said. “Everything seemed to come together and we were just so excited to be competitive with Princeton and Brown, who we consider to be national title contenders.”
 
LIGHTWEIGHTS
The Radcliffe lightweights faced a problem at the start of the 2013-2014 season: they didn’t have a coach. After Bartman improved the Black and White’s performance in each of the last two seasons—turning the crew into a national title contender—his sudden departure for the men’s team left an empty seat in the launch for the women’s squad.
The few weeks without a coach did not prevent Radcliffe from establishing dominance early on, however, and Lou Berl replaced Bartman just in time to lead the first varsity eight to the top collegiate finish in the Head of the Charles.
The Black and White carried the momentum from the fall into the spring season, in which the first varsity went undefeated in dual races. The most notable victory came at the Lightweight Invitational in April, where then-No. 2 Radcliffe swept four top-10 teams to establish itself as the team to beat.
“We have great depth on this team right now,” said junior Adelaide Backer after the race. “Since I have come to Harvard, I don’t think we have had such a competitive seat-racing season. I think [our depth] has really increased our competitiveness across the board this year and is really promising going forward.”
Last weekend at Eastern Sprints, the team’s first varsity once again proved its dominance on its way to winning a gold medal in the 1V race for the second straight year. The boat won by more than four seconds with a time of 6:26.536, setting the course record.
After being ranked No. 1 going into nationals last year and yet losing to Stanford in the grand final, the Black and White is not taking anything for granted. The crew will head into IRAs as the favorite to take home the gold, but may once again need to finish with a victory over the Cardinal to claim its first national championship since 1997.
“I think our [second-place] performance [last year] really left us hungry for more,” said co-captain Elizabeth Lenczowski at the start of the season. “We’re looking forward to the challenge of topping that. We’re all really motivated to work hard toward a gold medal at the IRAs this year…. We all came back ready to train hard and win a championship this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What would you put on your bucket list if you found out you only had a few months left to live? It’s a question people love to speculate about, but I don’t think you could possibly know the answer until you are actually faced with your own mortality.
When my grandfather, Konstantinos “Gus” Ilvanakis, was told that he had anywhere between two and 12 months left to live last July, his answer was simple and not at all surprising to anyone who knew him:
“Doc,” he said, “I want to see the Seahawks win the Super Bowl and watch my grandson graduate from Harvard, can you do that for me?”
That these were the two ambitions for a man who was born on the other side of the world 53 years before the Seahawks existed and whose formal education ceased after middle school is pretty remarkable, and yet Grandpa believed.
Unfortunately, cancer caught up to Grandpa Gus before he could tick off either wish; in October, his incredible life of 90 years came to an end. I’ve never been one to trust in fate or the supernatural, but as the Seahawks marched to their first Super Bowl in franchise history, I couldn’t help but think that he had something to do with it. When Russell Wilson, the Legion of Boom, and Co. went “Beast Mode” on the Denver Broncos at the MetLife Stadium, I was overcome by emotion. Three months later, the feeling hasn’t gone away—I recently told a friend that I haven’t had a bad day since Feb. 4. Somehow, 53 men I’ve never met removed a massive weight from my shoulders that I didn’t even know existed. The Seahawks are Super Bowl champions; I only wish Grandpa had been alive to see it happen.
Grandpa Gus was born in Kavala, Greece in 1923. In his 40-plus years before settling down in Bellingham, Wash., he lived through World War II and the following Greek Civil War, during which he learned the skills to be an electrician for the rest of his life. He came out of it all with an incredible joy for life and a deep belief in the singular power of an education—a belief he and my Grandma Maria passed on to their daughters, who passed it on to my brother and me. Neither of them had seen the fruits of an education in their own lives, but they chose to believe, and I’ll never be able to thank them enough for that.
If the greatest thing about America for Grandpa Gus was the access to an education, then professional sports were definitely somewhere in the top five. Unluckily for him—and, until recently, for me and generations of Koenigs far and near—for all the wonderful things about the Pacific Northwest, it was far from the ideal place for someone who loves sports to settle. The Sonics were the first Big Four professional team to come to Seattle in 1967; they won a championship in 1979 and were pretty good in the 90’s, but otherwise were largely irrelevant. The biggest moments in Mariners history are a double in 1995 and a really good regular season in 2001. The Seahawks have mostly been competitive, but before Pete Carroll showed up in 2010, my two most vivid memories of the team are of Matt Hasselbeck throwing a pick-six and the refs deciding Super Bowl XL. Long story short, it was a lofty goal Grandpa set for the Seahawks this year.
But he believed, and so did I, and so will millions of fans of dozens of teams next year and every year into the future until finally that belief is rewarded. Because that’s all you can do when you care a great deal about the outcome of something you have no control over: believe. Grandpa’s annual belief was contagious. Surely, if it was ever going to happen for my Hawks it had to be this year, with this team. Being taken along for the ride to the title was an incredible experience, made all the better by the thought of how happy it would make Grandpa to see our dreams coming true. “I can’t help but say it,” my Dad wrote after the game, “This one was for Gus. The 12th Man is everywhere.”
No matter the time of day or the thousands of miles between us, when the Seahawks are on I know that the 12th men of the Koenig-Ilvanakis clan are watching and believing. And when I walk across that stage to get my diploma, I know that they’ll be watching too, wherever they may be.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s water polo team entered its match against then-No. 14 St. Francis with a 3-8 record, trying to get its season on the right track.
The Terriers had not lost a game at home since 2002 and had been one of the more dominant teams on the East Coast for years, but Harvard desperately needed a win to gain some momentum in late September.
The Crimson went down to St. Francis early in the contest, but came back with a strong 6-3 resurgence in the third quarter, eventually winning the contest, 14-11.
From there, the entire season changed.
“The big win at St. Francis was huge,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “It would have been really easy for us to just be satisfied and say ‘that win defines our season,’ but we kept playing hard and kept playing against good teams and still [got] good results.”
The Crimson went on a seven-game winning streak—all against conference opponents—to improve to 10-8 on the season and 8-1 in CWPA Northern division competition.
Eventually, Harvard would go on a second seven-game streak in late October, which included another defeat of St. Francis, improving to 11-1 in conference play.
With its late-season surge, Harvard seized the regular season conference title and finished its 2013 campaign with an overall record of 18-14 and an home record of 7-1 at Blodgett.
“We achieved almost all of our goals,” Minnis said. “I was very proud of the way that we played this year…. We love playing here [at home], and we love the crowds that we get. We always want to make sure we are playing our best here.”
The Crimson eventually fell to St. Francis in the conference tournament—its only loss at home—but its second-place finish in the league was the highest spot that the team has claimed since 2004.
After having not made the national rankings since 2002, the team finished its season ranked 17th in the country, maintaining its spot in the national polls for a team-record eight straight weeks.
Having springboarded the program to its current success, Minnis garnered CWPA Coach of the Year recognition. Before this campaign, Harvard had not had a winning record since 2004, illustrating the magnitude of the team’s turnaround.
“This year was a major improvement from last season,” sophomore goaltender Colin Woolway said. “We made a major step up from a team with a lot of potential to a team that is truly competing with the best teams on the East Coast.”
Making its accomplishments all the more notable is the fact that the Crimson team is remarkably young.
Its seniors, though integral to the team’s chemistry and overall performance, were not the main contributors to the team’s efforts in the pool.
Co-captain attacker Will Roller missed many games this season due to injury, and fellow co-captain goaltender Jimmy Field split time with Woolway, who received the lion’s share of the playtime.
“[Roller and Field] have been amazing,” Minnis said. “They are two great leaders. They accomplished all of their goals and I couldn’t have asked for better.”
The vast majority of the team’s production came from its freshman and sophomore classes. Over half of the Harvard roster is composed of sophomores, including the top two scorers, attacker Noah Harrison and 2-meter Ben Zepfel.
In addition to leading the team with 70 goals, Harrison also had a team-high 69 steals. He was named to the All-CWPA second team, and Zepfel garnered first team accolades for the second straight year.
“The sophomore class came in last year with a bang,” Minnick said. “They came back this year and really just continued [what] they started. I am just happy we have them for two more years.”
Also integral to the team’s success was the play of its three freshmen.
Attacker Joey Colton led the team in assists, was second in steals, and was third in goals, also earning a spot on the All-CWPA second team.
Attacker Viktor Wrobel and 2-meter defender Dan Stevens both scored over 30 goals, putting them in the team’s top five scorers.
“We were by far the youngest team at our championship,” Harrison said. “Without a doubt, we are a growing and improving team, and as time goes on, we will continue to get better. Our youth is really going to help us to maximize our potential going forward into next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It may not have had the perfect ending, but that may have been the only flaw in the Harvard women’s squash team’s impressive 2013-2014 season. The Crimson, which was ranked first in the country for the entire year, went undefeated in the regular season in its quest to defend the 2013 CSA Team Championships, college squash’s naional title, ultimately falling just short, 5-4, in the Howe Cup final to Trinity.
“As coaches, we were very proud of the team,” Harvard coach Mike Way said. “The reason I say that is because even though we didn’t win the national title, we did not think we were the best team in the league at the beginning, and the girls had to step up. There was no way that we would have sat here and said, ‘Okay, these are all going to be W’s.’ So then [having] the [undefeated] season  and winning the Ivy title was just fantastic.”
The national title contest was a rematch of last year’s final, a 5-4 Harvard victory, as well as a rematch of the teams’ regular season matchup two weeks earlier, which the Crimson also took by a 5-4 margin.
The latest iteration was no less dramatic, as the match saw four contests go to five games and came down to the last match to crown a national champion.
With Harvard down, 4-3, freshman Dileas MacGowan came back from two sets down at the sixth position to stay undefeated in her first collegiate season. However, Trinity freshman Anna Kimberley stayed tough against sophomore Saumya Karki despite losing the first set. Kimberley worked her way back in, winning two straight games and going up, 10-8, in the fourth game to give herself two match ball opportunities. Karki managed to get within one with a strong shot, but Kimberley held on for an 11-9 win, giving the national title to the Bantams.
“Perhaps [the difference] had to do with this level of expectation,” Way said. “We just went in there [in the regular season]...going into that cauldron of Trinity is tough, but we didn’t really have that huge target on our back. But we were very impressed with them in the nationals.... If you’re going to lose to a team, you want to lose to a team like that.”
Despite the loss in the Howe Cup finals, the Crimson earned wins over tough competition to stay undefeated in the regular season. While the team was ranked at No. 1 for much of the season, Harvard went into several matches as the underdog on paper, and prevailed over perennially difficult opponents like Trinity, Princeton, Yale, and Penn on its way to a perfect record and the Ivy League title.
“The Penn match had such a big impact on the season,” assistant coach Luke Hammond said. “We knew that they were so strong on paper and there was so much parity, and we didn’t really know if there was one strong team that was going to emerge…. That was where the momentum shifted and I felt all of the girls starting to really feel like we were the team to beat.”
Individually, the Crimson saw junior Amanda Sobhy win her third consecutive national championship with a straight-sets victory over Trinity’s Kanzy El Defrawy. Sobhy was named Ivy League Player of the Year, while junior co-captain Haley Mendez and rookie Katie Tutrone were named to the All-Ivy team at the conclusion of the season. The Crimson received notable contributions from freshmen Tutrone and MacGowan, who posted 11-2 and 15-0 records in the third and seventh positions, respectively.
“Dileas MacGowan was the standout,” Way said. “What a ridiculous season she had. She’s just a lovely kid. There’s no one that would have predicted, what, 15-0? No one would have predicted it. And Katie? What an attitude from both of those young women. They went beyond expectations. When we recruited them, we were not expecting what we got. Bloody wonderful, we’ve got them for three more years.”
With Harvard’s entire starting lineup returning, the team is looking forward to avenging its national championship loss next season.
“We were so close this year, and next year everyone knows that we’re only going to be stronger,” Mendez said. “The team is ready to come back with a vengeance. Everyone is planning on training their hardest this summer and throughout next season, because we don’t want to be in the same position we were in this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“This one’s over,” I heard a fan say as he ushered his family out through the gates of Princeton Stadium.
With 13:02 remaining in the fourth quarter, the Harvard football team had scored another touchdown, its fifth of the game, to take a healthy 34-10 lead over Princeton. It appeared almost a foregone conclusion that the heavily-favored Crimson would roll to yet another victory and extend the longest winning streak in the nation to 15.
The season’s only remaining question, it seemed, was whether Harvard would win its four remaining games to repeat as Ivy League champion, and, in doing so, make 2012 the program’s first undefeated campaign in almost a decade.
***
When you cover a team all season, it’s easy to become a fan and difficult to avoid rooting for success. But covering a team is not—cannot—be about that. It’s about the narratives that unfold and the characters who create them.
It’s about the star defensive lineman who perseveres through the deaths of both parents and bouts of homelessness to become the Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year and a legitimate NFL prospect. The quarterback who is too small to be as good as he is and one day hopes to perfect a different kind of Hail Mary, this time as a pastor.
But, even beyond football, it is as much about those who fail as those who succeed. The recruit who never quite gets his shot, relegated to the bench for four long years. The coach who, despite assembling some of the nation’s best recruiting classes, can’t seem to put an elite team together.
These are stories about people, about goals, about teams. And though you’ll find them in the sports section, they’re just as often about something different entirely.
***
In the next five minutes and 19 seconds, Princeton scored not once, but twice, both times successfully converting two-point attempts. The comfortable 24-point lead had narrowed to eight.
Princeton was storming back, and the once-dejected crowd was now reengaged in the game.
***
The Crimson, and my time writing sports, is about other stories, too. Of fall afternoons driving through an ever-changing Northeast, of spring mornings in a small corner of The Crimson making sure this story or that picture is just right.
And, much like the stories we tell, these ones are fundamentally about people, too. Of learning at the hands of a co-Sports Chair whose sheer knack for the craft is unsurpassed by anyone I’ve worked with before or since, or a brother who refuses to shy away from what is right.
***
Perhaps Harvard had reclaimed its rhythm. After Princeton had stormed down half the field in under a minute, the Crimson responded, marching 52 yards in 86 seconds to the Princeton 5-yard line.
One, two, three downs later, and Harvard hadn’t budged an inch, let alone a yard. Fourth down proved to be the most disastrous yet, and a blocked field goal meant the Crimson was thwarted again.
With under 2:30 remaining, the Tigers struck for the third time in the quarter. Another touchdown, putting the hosts only two points away from knotting the score at 34. Mercifully, the two-point attempt proved futile, and the Crimson escaped clinging to the narrowest of leads.
But the bad news kept coming for Harvard. Three-and-out, Princeton ball. First down after first down for the Tigers. And then, a prayer, thrown up and brought down in the corner of the end zone. Touchdown Princeton, ahead, 39-34, with eight seconds left.
Moments later, as time wound down on the game clock and the Crimson’s shot at perfection, the stunned orange-and -black faithful stormed the field.
***
This is my 30th—and final—sports column for The Crimson or, barring something fairly unforeseen, any publication.
Of all the types of stories—the recaps, the blog posts, the features—none captivate me quite like column writing. It offers almost total freedom in distilling a story to its core essence.
For that, I owe a great debt of gratitude to the great LA Times columnist Jim Murray, whose collected works I stumbled upon in the summer of 2011. He understood what makes sports, and people, tick.
About baseball’s spring training, he once wrote, “It’s March. Everybody wins the pennant. Every pitcher is Cy Young. Every batter is Ty Cobb.” He understood that, before every season or even game, there exists a sense of optimism, at least of some sort, and uncertainty.
Because you really never know. Often times, things turn out exactly as planned. But sometimes, the unexpected or, to paraphrase Vin Scully, the impossible happens. The hero becomes the goat, or the goat the hero; the heavily-favored defending champion allows 29 unanswered points in the fourth quarter and, inexplicably, loses.
It’s all part of a circularity, of sports, of stories. You never know where it’s headed, never know what’s coming next. And that’s the point.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Throughout her career in Cambridge, junior Amanda Sobhy has proven one thing time and time again: when she walks onto the squash court, she’s there to win.
For the third straight year, Sobhy cruised through the CSA Individual National Championships on her way to a Ramsay Cup victory. With the triumph, Sobhy became the first player in Harvard history to win the Ramsay Cup three times.
“Winning the third national title is a great feeling,” Sobhy said. “It’s not only winning for me, but also winning for Harvard, so it’s a nice feeling to know that I have done something great for myself and for the school.”
However, it’s not just that Sobhy consistently wins; it’s how she does it. 
In this year’s national championship finals, Sobhy easily swept her opponent in straight sets. Despite finding herself in early deficits in two of the games, the score wasn’t even close, as Sobhy calmly dispatched her opponent with scores of 11-6, 11-5, and 11-3. 
“[Sobhy is] just a physical beast,” Harvard coach Mike Way said. “When you’re thinking from an athletic point of view, there’s just no area where she doesn’t excel, and look how high she sets the bar…. The most impressive thing about her is her work ethic. Her work ethic is ridiculous.”
Sobhy finished the regular season with a perfect 17-0 record, and not a single collegiate player was able to take a game off her the entire season. She holds a perfect 47-0 career record, and shows no sign of stopping as she heads into her senior season.
“The biggest thing for her growth as a player...is maturity,” Way said. “It’s the maturity that you see in athletes as they get older. You can go through the specifics—she’s hitting the ball a little better, she’s more tactically aware—but the real growth is her maturity and mental attitude.”
In team competition, Sobhy helped her team clinch a win over second-ranked Trinity in the regular season, and nearly led it to a third straight national title from the top spot in the lineup, but Harvard lost to the Bantams, 5-4, in the national title finals. 
“She stepped up in a leadership role for the team [this year],” Way said. “At critical moments, she stepped up and she spoke to the team….  She picked her moments, and that was the real maturity for me, was when she held court.... When Amanda came in with the right words, at the right time.”
Sobhy was named Ivy League Player of the Year for the third straight year. She heads into her senior season with two goals: national crowns for both herself and her team.
“It would be great to end my college season on a high note,” Sobhy said. “Next season the team will be a lot stronger, so I think that will give us a lot of confidence to get the national title back.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After graduating only three seniors from the 2013 squad and returning a host of players to its roster, the Harvard baseball team had its sights set on the top of the Ivy League—a place the program had not been since 2005.
But despite finding itself in the race for a berth in the Ancient Eight championship as it entered the penultimate weekend of the year, the Crimson (11-28, 5-15 Ivy) fell flat in the final games of the season—losing seven straight contests to end the year—and settled for last in the Red Rolfe Division.
“We obviously didn’t perform the way we wanted to perform,” junior co-captain Ethan Ferreira said. “We didn’t get as many wins as we thought we would in the beginning of the season.”
But the unfavorable results of those games largely shrouded the squad’s competitiveness. Five of the final seven conference losses were decided by three runs or fewer, and two went into extra innings.
Harvard often fell victim to the big inning on defense, as its opponents racked up hits and took advantage of Crimson walks and errors to put the game out of reach in a single frame.
“There were occasions when we’d have one bad inning and give up five, six, seven, eight runs,” senior utilityman Carlton Bailey said. “And after that, you’re kind of fizzled out mentally…. We [would] play well, and then [in] one inning everything would go wrong.”
These defensive breakdowns made it difficult to generate any momentum, as Harvard managed to win consecutive games only twice this season.
Despite a disappointing end result, however, the spring still contained plenty of positives. Perhaps the most notable was the team taking home the Beanpot championship for the first time since 2005.
Playing at O’Donnell Field on April 9, the Crimson recovered from a 4-0 deficit to outlast Boston College, 6-5, in a game in which six different Harvard hurlers took the hill. Twelve days later, the Crimson defeated UMass, 3-0, to bring the trophy back to Cambridge.
Harvard also registered three wins—one more than last season’s total—against tough competition on its annual spring break trip. The biggest victory of the week came in a 7-3 decision over Michigan State. After being blanked by the Spartans in the previous two games, the Crimson bats roared to life, with co-captain Kyle Larrow driving home four runs in the win.
Another bright spot came in Harvard’s first Ivy League game against Cornell. Things looked bleak when the Big Red tied the game in the bottom of the seventh, but Harvard never blinked. Larrow plated Bailey with a single in the top of the tenth to put the Crimson ahead for good.
“Surprisingly, in the dugout, it was very calm,” Bailey said. “There was no pressing; we were confident. And when we’re confident, we tend to play a lot better and we win games…. We were telling ourselves that if we were going to go that far, then we were going to win that game.”
The Harvard offense saw most of its production come from the top of its lineup. The team’s first three hitters—Bailey, Larrow, and junior outfielder Mike Martin—led the squad with batting averages of .319, .285, and .304, respectively.
On the defensive side, a young pitching rotation guided Harvard through the season with a capable one-two punch of sophomore Sean Poppen and freshman Nick Gruener. The duo led the team in innings pitched and posted 2.51 and 3.88 ERAs, respectively.
“[The pitching staff] looks awesome,” Bailey said. “I wish I could play for the next couple years behind these guys. The fact that they’re so young and performing at the level they are, there’s no telling what they’ll do in the [future].”
The 2014 campaign may have been a disappointment in terms of the team’s win-loss record, but the season was only Harvard coach Bill Decker’s second year on the job. The Crimson will have a host of young talent returning next spring, and Decker’s first true recruiting class will enter Harvard in the fall.
“I definitely feel that the team moving forward is going to be in contention for the title, because the coaches are starting a good foundation for this new program,” Bailey said. “I know they’ll be successful. If they’re not, I’ll be very surprised.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just five games from the end of the Harvard softball team’s 2014 season, everything was looking up for the Crimson. After starting the season with an 8-7 record, a tally that included a stunning victory over Louisiana State and a disappointing 5-7 trip to California, the Crimson embarked on an 18-game winning streak to bump its record up to an impressive 26-7-1.
However, Harvard (28-15-1, 14-3-1 Ivy) was unable to maintain the streak, as the team dropped three of four games to league rival Dartmouth at the conclusion of the season to give the Big Green the Ivy League North Division title, eliminating itself from contention for an Ivy League Championship Game berth.
“The season was ultimately definitely difficult,” junior pitcher Laura Ricciardone said. “Nonetheless, the season had a lot of high points for not only this team in this particular season, but for Harvard softball as a program.”
The high point of the season came early for the Crimson, when the team traveled to Baton Rouge for the Purple and Gold Challenge hosted by No. 23 LSU.
Despite going into the game as the heavy underdog, the Crimson outlasted the Tigers to earn the victory in a contest that lasted 12 innings.
After junior shortstop Emily Gusse knocked in co-captain outfielder Shelbi Olson in the top of the 12th to put Harvard up, 1-0, LSU roared back in the bottom half of the inning to load the bases with two outs. Ricciardone did not waver, however, and recorded the final out on a strikeout to clinch the win for the Crimson, which went on to win the tournament with another extra-innings victory over Jackson State in the final.
However, the LSU victory was followed by a lackluster roadtrip to California, during which the team lost four straight games and managed to come back to Cambridge with a .500 record leading into the Ivy League season.
While the season certainly had its fair share of disappointment and frustration for the Crimson, the coaches and players were quick to point out that this year’s team had a grittiness and resilience that allowed for success even after suffering significant losses.
“It was difficult to have such incredible success in the beginning of and throughout the season...and then not have the outcome that we had hoped for,” Ricciardone said. “The team showed a lot of grit in [the face of] adversity throughout the season.”
The Crimson displayed its collection of high-end talent throughout the year, as both the pitching rotation and the batting order at times showed exceptional ability—although often one made up for the other. Ricciardone led the Ivy League with a 1.53 ERA and tied for the league lead in wins. Freshman Taylor Cabe and sophomore Morgan Groom also posted top-10 ERAs in the Ancient Eight.
With the underclassmen spearheading the team on the mound, the Crimson was led by its two captains at the plate. Co-captain Kasey Lange was second in the Ancient Eight in on-base percentage and hit six home runs. Olson hit .329 and stole 15 bases to finish second on the team in both statistical categories. Junior Katie Lantz also had a breakout year, hitting .326 with 12 doubles and two home runs.
Yet, for the second year in a row, the Crimson dropped three of four in the final weekend, giving Dartmouth the chance to represent the North Division in the Ivy League best-of-three championship series.
“In the end, we didn’t take care of business against Dartmouth,” Ricciardone said. “They are such a competitive team and the results were so close.... It will serve as good motivation for the team next year.”
The squad, which will return a large contingent next year, has now experienced the disappointment of being knocked out of championship contention twice at the hands of Dartmouth, and will be hungry in 2015 for another berth in the championship series that it reached in 2011 and 2012.
In order to do so, however, the Crimson will likely have to face the Big Green once again, the team that ultimately won the championship series against Penn.
“As a team, we did a great job of stepping up, taking everything in stride, and being flexible,” Lange said. “Now [that the team has] some extra motivation, I think that everyone wants to get back to the championship.”

The Harvard men’s squash team executed a nearly flawless season: not only did the No. 1 Crimson (18-0, 7-0 Ivy) go undefeated in the regular season and go on to secure the national title with three 9-0 wins, but senior Ali Farag also captured the individual national crown.
“I think everyone was very dedicated this year,” co-captain Brandon McLaughlin said. “In years past, people have been busy, but I think everyone was really focused entirely on squash for the entire three months of the season, which is really important. We knew we had a good team, so as long as everyone stayed committed, which they were, we would be okay.”
The Crimson’s starting lineup this season included five seniors, four of whom play in the team’s top five spots. Farag, co-captains Gary Power and McLaughlin, Nigel Koh, and Thomas Mullaney all served as strong presences who set the tone for their final season.
McLaughlin and Power kept the team focused and on track to win both the Ivy League trophy and the Potter Cup, college squash’s team national title, according to Harvard coach Mike Way.
“There’s a swagger in [McLaughlin and Power] that was exactly what was needed,” Way said. “They wanted it so badly, and what it meant was that there wasn’t going to be a problem with work ethic. As coaches we would almost have to pull the reins in on the team, which is an easier thing to do than to tell a kid to do more.”
The fact that 12 of the team’s 18 wins were shutouts may make it appear that the entire season was smooth sailing for the Crimson, but that is not the case. 
On Feb. 4, Harvard came up against Trinity, the No. 1-ranked team at the time. The Crimson downed the Bantams, 7-2, in an upset that handed Trinity its first at-home loss in 18 years. With the win over the Bantams in the regular season, the Crimson rose to the top seed going into nationals.
The only two losses came from freshman Bryan Koh and sophomore Nick Hopcroft, who both avenged their defeats against their respective opponents in the finals of the CSA Team National Championships two weeks later. 
“None of these young men will forget this season,” Way said. “How can they? But they’re carrying with them something beyond that…. Whatever is happening mentally during your game, when things slow down and get clearer, you can move forward again. I’m just so happy for them on an individual basis.”
Another matchup that proved difficult was the Harvard-Yale rivalry, in which the Crimson managed to pull away with a 6-3 win both in the Ivy Scrimmages and the regular season matchup. While the game against Brown decided the Ivy League championship, Harvard’s real test came the day before, when its players at the No. 4, 5, and 6 spots  dropped their matches against the Bulldogs. But the squad pulled ahead when it swept five of its six other matchups to claim a share of the conference crown.
While the Crimson dominated its Ancient Eight slate, the players had to keep themselves in check in order to focus on winning the Potter Cup.
“I wanted us to do it as quietly as a men’s team at Harvard can go,” Way said. “So I did not like the brash comments, any public statements. Toning it down and bringing in more respect will actually lower anxiety. I always tell my players that they need to be respectful because that’s the right way to behave, and this is where the deeper level of focus is in an athlete.”
In addition to team accomplishments, the Harvard squad garnered multiple individual awards. Farag claimed his second individual national title after having lost the year before in the semifinals. He was also named Ivy League Player of the Year, CSA All-America first team, and the squad’s Most Valuable Player. McLaughlin joined Farag as an All-America first team member, and he and Power shared the Coaches’ Award at the end of the season. Freshman Dylan Murray claimed the Ivy League Rookie of the Year award, and classmate Koh shared the team’s Most Improved Player award with Mullaney.
“I think the team definitely accomplished what it set out to do,” Farag said. “Not just in terms of squash results, but also more importantly in terms of maturity and court awareness. When I look back at how we carried ourselves in the season the years before versus today, I think we should be proud of how far we’ve come.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the 2013 season began for the Harvard softball team, most of its players had only one objective on their minds: winning another Ivy League championship. The Crimson was coming off of a stellar season in which it had captured the Ancient Eight title and won two games in the NCAA regional round.
Much of that success was due to the performance of then-sophomore Laura Ricciardone, who was named second team All-Ivy for the second time in as many seasons. But as her teammates geared up for another run at a championship, Ricciardone was 1,500 miles away­.
Instead of staring down opposing teams’ batters from the mound, Ricciardone was facing a much bigger challenge. Then a rising junior, she made the decision not to return to campus for the academic year in order to stay home and take care of her mother after she received a cancer diagnosis.
While at home, Ricciardone found a job at a health insurance company. As she balanced taking care of her mother and her job, Ricciardone still found time to train.
“I did a lot of off-the-field conditioning and lifting, as well as softball pitching to stay in shape,” Ricciardone said. “My main focus was on my fitness level.”
So after watching her team come up short in its quest for another Ivy League title, Ricciardone returned this year more motivated and more ready than ever.
Aside from Ricciardone, the Crimson returned a very formidable pitching staff. No one could anticipate that Ricciardone would perform at the same high level after a year without softball—particularly after what she had endured the previous year.
“It was the longest time I have been without softball games since I was very young,” Ricciardone said. “It was definitely different, but coming back, it was like riding a bike. It comes right back and it was a great feeling to be back out there on the mound with my teammates behind me.”
In her first appearance in the circle since defeating Penn in the Ivy League Championship Series 21 months before, Ricciardone didn’t miss a beat. The junior shut out Eastern Michigan, throwing a complete game and notching her first win of the season.
While Ricciardone’s first game back was an impressive performance in itself, her highlight of the season would come a week later when Harvard flew to Louisiana to play in the Purple and Gold Challenge, at which the Crimson faced No. 23 LSU in a homecoming of sorts for Ricciardone.
With as many wins as losses on the season, Harvard seemed to have the chips stacked against it in its attempt to beat the nationally-ranked Tigers. In a duel that took over three hours, Ricciardone was relentlesss, firing 181 pitches and facing 46 batters, while letting none of them cross the plate. Finally, in the top of the 12th frame, junior shortstop Emily Gusse singled to center field, driving in the game’s first run. Ricciardone took care of the rest from there,  even striking out the final batter to end the game.
“Laura pitched incredibly at LSU,” co-captain Kasey Lange said. “It was a homecoming for the ages. They couldn’t hit her, they couldn’t put the ball in play…and she was the catalyst for us all.”
In a season that included an 18-game winning streak, a program home run record, and seven All-Ivy selections, Ricciardone’s gutty performance that day was the highlight of it all.
The junior went on to earn her third All-Ivy accolade, this time as a first team selection. Ricciardone finished the season leading all Ivy pitchers with a 1.53 earned-run average.
In addition, Ricciardone was named the team’s Most Outstanding Pitcher, tied a record with five Ivy League Pitcher of the Week awards, and was given the nod as a member of the NFCA All-Region team.
“Returning, Laura knew she was going to be our ace and she worked hard for it,” Lange said. “She is going to grow even more over the summer and fall, and when she comes back senior year, she’ll be lights out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year, then-junior Ali Farag ended his season early when St. Lawrence’s Amr Khaled Khalifa unseated Farag in the semifinals of the CSA Individual Championships in five games. However, this year the senior on the Harvard men’s squash team was able to reclaim his title as collegiate squash’s national champion in a 3-1 victory over the same opponent.
“Everyone has those players that are just out there,” Harvard coach Mike Way said. “But above and beyond being at the level of a professional player is the actual nature of this ‘boy.’ It’s the ‘boy’ nature—the freshness, the love that this boy has for the game and for people—that is what is so rare. He has this joy that he brings to the game that is infectious.... He led as a player, he led in attitude, he was the most coachable—even as the number one player on the team.”
Before Harvard, Farag was ranked first among juniors in the world, won the 2010 Junior World Championships, and helped lead the Egypt junior squash team to a world title in 2010 as its captain. He hesitated when Harvard offered him the opportunity to study abroad and play collegiate squash because of his ties with his home country. 
“I was very attached to Egypt and I still am,” Farag said. “At first I didn’t want to come to Harvard at all. However, after I did my interview in January, the revolution happened, and at this point I said I had to come here, get a college degree, and go back after and try to do something for Egypt.”
Farag came into the U.S. collegiate squash world with high momentum and built a squash career punctuated by impressive honors. Since transferring to Harvard as a sophomore, he has garnered awards such as Academic All-Ivy, CSA All-America first team, CSA Individual Champion, Ivy League Rookie of the Year, and Ivy League Player of the Year even before his last season here.
“[Farag] has such a clear line of what is right and what is wrong,” Way said. “So when something was not right [on the squash court]—a cheating opponent, a bad referee—it would upset him because he could never, in his life, think about cheating on the squash court. It became a very emotional thing, and he has learned how to deal with that adversity and he’s matured over the years.”
The 2013-2014 season was different for Farag as he not only went the entire season undefeated, but also won each of his matches in shutouts until the individual championships final against Khalifa, who managed to take just one game.
“[Farag] is unbelievable as a squash player, but also as a person,” co-captain Brandon McLaughlin said. “He’s also an engineering student so he’s working all the time. To be able to come to practice...and perform as well as he does is really an incredible achievement and a testament to what a good person he is. I have an immense amount of respect for everything he has accomplished.”
At team nationals in February, Farag was the last athlete to play against Trinity in the finals, with knowedge that Harvard had won the title, but still soundly defeated his opponent, 3-0, to complete the 9-0 victory for the Crimson.
“The one thing I will remember most is just [the] team and the relationships I have made with these guys,” Farag said. “I’m going to take care to see what they do in the future and I hope they will continue to care about what I do in the future too.”
Farag will graduate with the perfect statistics of a 20-0 season record as the No. 1 player for Harvard this season, in addition to a 52-2 career record in that same slot.
“People look up to him,” McLaughlin said. “They look at the way he carries himself leading up to matches, the way he performs, how composed he is—he’s a great sportsman on the court, and just the ideal player that you want at the top of the lineup.”
At the end of the CSA Team National Championships, Farag also won the Skillman Award, given to a player who has demonstrated great sportsmanship in his college career. 
“His legacy is going to go down in history,” Way said. “He’s played a brand of squash here that no one has ever seen in our sport. He’s definitely going to live on for the guys who have played alongside him, and also for us as the coaches. As long as we’re in the driver’s seat, we will refer to Ali and how no one respects the game as much as he does—respecting referees, opponents, coaches—that’s part of his legacy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its 2013 campaign, the Harvard men’s volleyball team advanced to the EIVA tournament finals for the first time in program history. One year later, a season-ending playoff loss in the semifinals to Princeton thwarted any attempt at another title run. But even the loss could not diminish the success of the Crimson’s 2014 season, which was full of program bests in conference wins, national rankings, and all-EIVA player selections.
“Given the whole season together, I think we played some great volleyball,” co-captain Nick Madden said. “I think we did the program proud. We did well on the road, in California, and in the Midwest, and I’m proud of the way we ended.”
Harvard (15-8, 11-3 EIVA) came into the season riding the momentum of past years’ successes. The team had advanced to the playoffs in each of the previous two years. The Crimson entered the season ranked No. 13 in the nation in the preseason polls and looked towards the possibility of supplanting rival Penn State from its spot at the top of the EIVA.
After an early season trip to California, Harvard opened conference play at home against the Tigers, the only other Ancient Eight school with a men’s volleyball program. The rivals have met nine times over the past three seasons, and six of those matches have gone the distance to a full five sets.
Both regular-season matchups against Princeton continued this trend, and both times the Crimson dug out the win in the fifth. With a strong senior class, Harvard was often able to use its experience and veteran leadership in tight situations.
Madden led the team throughout the season, especially in the team’s contests against the Tigers. His 17 kills in the home fixture paced the Crimson, and he followed that up with a double-double showing later in the season at Princeton.
Co-captain and libero Chris Gibbons also stepped up in big games. All season he was Harvard’s defensive stalwart, becoming the program’s leader in career digs. Double-digit dig performances against Concordia, Ball State, and Princeton were impressive performances in road tests.
In six five-set matches this season, the Crimson went 5-1, a testament to the determination and resilience the team showed all campaign.
“Our team is pretty clutch,” Madden said. “We finish tight games, [and] we won a lot of games that went to five this year. Not all of them—that was our goal in the preseason—but we compete really hard. When it comes down to it, we will do whatever it takes to get that win.”
Aside from leadership, another key ingredient in the Harvard recipe is team chemistry. Junior middle blocker Caleb Zimmick, who has been named a co-captain for next season, believes that this cohesion was responsible for taking the Crimson to greater heights this year.
“We’re really tight knit, from all the starters on all the way down on the bench,” Zimmick said. “It’s a really close group, and because of that we’re able to challenge each other and push each other, and I think that definitely helped us to be better.”
And so, 11 conference wins later, with conference losses only to Penn State twice and George Mason on the road, the Crimson prepared to face Princeton in the postseason semifinals. Unfortunately for the Crimson, a 3-1 loss to the Tigers ended Harvard’s 2014 run.
“It was a pretty demoralizing loss,” Zimmick said. “We beat them twice during the year, but at that time, in that game, they were better than us.”
Despite no postseason success, team members had strong individual years. Junior DJ White had another sterling season as a top-five hitter in the conference. Zimmick and junior Kyle Rehkemper made all-conference teams for their work as blockers, and freshman Nick Bendell stepped onto the team as starting setter, garnering Freshman All-American honors.
The Crimson had one of the best offenses in the country, posting a .289 kill percentage for the season, and its defense frequently bailed it out in close games.
Coach Brian Baise has taken this team to a level it hopes to maintain, competing at the top of the conference.
And the Crimson is not going away anytime soon, players said.
“I think the team will continue to get better,” Madden said. “I’m really excited for next season. We’ve got three great recruits coming in, and Caleb and DJ are stepping up into leadership positions and I know they’ll do well. I think we’re on a great trajectory.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dylan Murray already had a decorated squash career before he ever stepped onto a Harvard court. The five-time U.S. Junior National Champion and three-time Boy’s U19 U.S. National title-holder was also a 2013 WSF Men’s World Team Championship member.
This year, the freshman earned even more accolades. He was named Ivy League Rookie of the Year and finished the season in the No. 3 spot, sporting a 13-2 record.
“Dylan is such a talented kid,” senior Ali Farag said. “He works very hard and I think he deserves much more than just that title. What he achieved wasn’t just for him, it was for the entire team.”
Murray started as the fourth player in the Crimson lineup for two games before moving into the top three. In his first year, he helped the No. 1-ranked Crimson to an 18-0 record with 12 9-0 shutouts. The freshman had only two losses. One was a forfeit due to illness, and the other came when he moved up to play at No. 2 against the University of Rochester’s Mario Yanez.
 In an upset over Trinity, Murray defeated Vrishab Kotian in four games to contribute to the 7-2 win. He then went on to dominate Kotian again at the CSA Team National Championships.
“In the college scene, it’s about that maturity level,” Harvard coach Mike Way said. “So the question becomes if a player can learn quick enough to be able to handle that stress, and [Murray]…took it on. He’s grown into that role.”
At the end of the season, Murray garnered not just the Ivy League Rookie of the Year title, but was also a unanimously All-Ivy first team selection along with teammate Farag. 
“Coming in, [Murray] was a five or six-time national champion so he knew he was a good player, but adjusting to college is difficult,” co-captain Brandon McLaughlin said. “He always had high expectations for himself and he lived up to them this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Only a year after finishing in the bottom half of the Ivy League, the Harvard women’s volleyball team (14-9, 9-5 Ivy) climbed the Ancient Eight rankings in its 2013 campaign, claiming second place in conference play.
“It was really nice to come in and do better than we have the past few seasons,” said freshman outside hitterGrace Weghorst.
The highlight of the team’s season was its home match against archrival Yale. Four weeks after losing handedly to the Bulldogs in straight sets, the Crimson found itself one point away from returning the favor.
After having dropped the third and fourth sets, Harvard managed to go up, 14-9, in the fifth and final set. Freshman Corinne Bain served for the win, capping off the Crimson’s 3-2 victory. In the ensuing aftermath, players—and even coach Jennifer Weiss—were in tears elated after the Crimson handed Yale its first conference loss in over two years.
“What really did it was that everyone did their jobs,” said co-captain Natalie Doyle after the game. “We didn’t try to do anything fancy. Everyone kept it simple, we played our system, and we played the best volleyball we’ve ever played.”
With two games left in the season and first place in the conference out of reach, Harvard found itself tied with Penn.
Both teams had lost the previous evening, and after Yale took down the Quakers, the Crimson did not let an opportunity to get ahead go to waste again, and the squad stormed into Ithaca and took down last-place Cornell in straight sets to sit alone in second.
Bain had a standout year for Harvard. The first-year phenom won Ivy League Rookie of the Year honors by a unanimous vote for a campaign in which she set the Crimson record for aces in a single season with 565. She also ranked third for Harvard in digs and kills, with 236 and 186, respectively, while leading the team in points on the season with 260.5.
Bain was not the only freshman to make a statement, as Weghorst was voted first team All-Ivy, finishing fourth on the Crimson in digs with 156 and second in kills with 189, including 21 in the statement win over the Bulldogs.
“The new freshman class came in and immediately clicked with the team,” Weghorst said. “We were able to come in and make an impact.”
Sophomore Kathleen Wallace and junior Caroline Walters rounded up Harvard’s postseason awards on the year. Wallace was the third Crimson player to be selected first team All-Ivy,and led the team with 217 kills on the season. Walters, who ranked fourth in kills for the Crimson with 172 on the year and fourth in the conference with 1.02 blocks per game, was recognized for her efforts by nabbing second team All-Ivy honors.
Despite finishing the season 4-6 on the road, the Crimson was able to notch two crucial road wins back-to-back on its annual trip to Penn and Princeton. Using the momentum from the previous weekend when the team had swept Cornell and Columbia at home, the Crimson easily defeated the Quakers in Philadelphia, 3-1, and routed the Tigers in straight sets, 3-0.
Penn and Princeton finished tied for third, only one game behind the Crimson.
The team also managed to post a winning record in nonconference games, a slate that included three games in California—marking its first trip to the West Coast since 2006. The team was undefeated in nonconference play at home and posted a 3-1 record against fellow Massachusetts-based schools, its lone loss coming at the hands of Northeastern.
The team will go forward without its three seniors: Erin Cooney, Doyle, and Teresa Skelly.
“This senior class was absolutely awesome,” Weghorst said. “They led our team. They were not only supportive on the court, but in everything that we did…. They really pulled together our entire team. We have some big shoes to fill, but I think our rising seniors can do it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Game Day was sacred to Peyton. During our junior season, we played Yale on her birthday, and whenever she was asked about her birthday plans that day, she replied, “It’s not my birthday until after we beat Yale.” This simple statement reflected Peyton’s utter devotion to Harvard women’s soccer. She lived for game day, competition, and getting better.
Peyton’s tangible contributions to helping our team win games can be looked up in statistical archives and box scores, but what I think is even more worth mentioning are the intangibles that have made her a great leader in our program and in athletics in general at Harvard.
The amount of emotional and psychological energy that she put into every practice and game rivaled her physicality, and the way in which she channeled all of herself and immersed herself in every competitive setting gave Peyton the ability to tap into and access an extra gear that is rare in athletics.
Oftentimes, athletes—even if they are not consciously aware—compete like they are saving themselves for something, although coaches constantly demand that we “leave it all out on the field.”
It’s difficult. It requires crossing emotional and psychological barriers to relinquish oneself completely to competition and stepping up in pressure situations.
Peyton is different in that she made herself vulnerable to these situations, acting with a coveted combination of intelligence and emotion, and showed the rest of our team that it was okay to be invested, okay to want to win, and okay to never be satisfied and always be striving for improvement.
The sign of a great leader is having the capacity to not only make yourself better, but also to make others around you better, and the way in which Peyton demonstrated a complete commitment to competition did just that. Every day, she gave all of us the courage to dig that competitive energy out from inside ourselves and work for the teammate next to us.
Her desire for competition and readiness to meet challenges head on are the envy of athletes everywhere trying to reach the next level and significantly contributed to the hunger and resilience that has come to be a defining characteristic of our program over the past few years.
During these four years, and especially during the two when Peyton served as captain, one of the things that I came to admire most about her was her ability to command the respect of players and coaches alike. She always held herself accountable for her actions both on and off the field, and demanded that everyone else do the same. When she spoke, everyone listened. Her confidence in herself and in the abilities of our team gave life to all of us, and she maintained that a belief in both our collective mission and our potential to compete was the necessary first step toward winning.
Peyton set the tone for our team and got everyone on board with this vision. With an emphasis on accountability and belief, she inspired our team to make things happen, not let things happen, and this take-initiative demeanor is the reason why we were able to win the Ivy League twice during our four years here.
Being demanding of one’s teammates is not always an easy task, but her ability to do this with maturity and respect was key to her success as a leader as well as to the success of our team. She empowered all of us to do the same, and this aspect of our team culture will be a prominent part of her lasting legacy on the women’s soccer team.
It is an honor to be able to speak about one of my closest friends in this way, and I feel so grateful for the memories and growth that we have shared over the past four years. She is so deserving of such recognition for all of her achievements and the impact that she has had on our program.
As our college careers come to an end, I know that the road ahead of her is full of even more possibilities and opportunities that she will undoubtedly take advantage of. I cannot wait to see what she achieves in this next phase of her life beyond the soccer field, and could not be prouder of all that she has already achieved here. Congrats, Peyt! Dream team forever.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When freshman Midge Purce arrived on campus last summer for preseason preperation with the women’s soccer team, lofty expectations accompanied her.
As a standout for Our Lady of Good Counsel High School, Purce was named Gatorade Player of the Year in the state of Maryland as a senior, in addition to earning NSCAA All-American honors as a sophomore and junior.
The Olney, Md., native also represented the United States in both the 2012 CONCACAF U17 Championship and the 2012 U17 World Cup, recording a hat trick against the Bahamas to help the United States capture the CONCACAF crown.
Naturally, Harvard coach Ray Leone hoped Purce would make an immediate impact upon her arrival in Cambridge, as the Crimson looked to rebound from a fourth-place finish in the Ivy League in 2012. Purce, on the other hand, had only one expectation for herself and all of her teammates.
“I don’t really ever go into a season expecting anything more than to give my best,” Purce said. “I know that that’s the expectation that the team had of me…and the same I had for them.”
With Purce leading the charge, Harvard certainly did not disappoint. The Crimson dominated the Ivy League, going undefeated against the rest of the Ancient Eight en route to an Ivy League title, the program’s fourth in six years.
Individually, Purce had a historic first-year campaign. The forward earned Ivy League Rookie of the Year and Ivy League Player of the Year honors, becoming the first women’s soccer player in the conference to ever win both awards in a single season.
When Harvard opened the season with three one-goal losses, Purce led the way in geting the team on track and securing the Crimson’s first win. She scored the lone goal of Harvard’s 1-0 victory over LIU Brooklyn, which along with a 1-1 tie with Providence helped jumpstart a 14-game unbeaten streak that lasted until the Crimson’s final game of the season.
“I think sometimes people always just point to that she’s an amazing athlete, she’s very talented, and all that stuff,” Leone said. “[But] she’s more than that. It’s a work ethic. It’s a desire every day to get better. We’ve got to kick her off the field, that’s how much she wants to practice.”
As Harvard looks ahead to next season, Purce’s drive manifests itself in her refusal to be complacent despite her success in 2013.
“I really love to learn from all my coaches, all the new players coming in, and players that we already have,” Purce said. “I just want to be a better soccer player.”
An even better Midge Purce could be a nightmare for the other Ivy League coaches. Last season, Purce had some of her best performances against Ancient Eight opponents, netting five of her 11 goals in the Crimson’s seven conference games. Purce says that she relishes the target that will be on her back as the reigning conference player of the year and a member of the defending champion team.
“I respect every single team in the Ivy League—each team has tremendous players and tremendous coaches,” Purce said. “I feel honored that other teams see us and they want to play us hard…because that makes us a better team.”
As a rookie, Purce still had to adjust to the collegiate game, and as she became more comfortable, she developed. As the season wore on, Purce improved as an offensive catalyst able to create for herself and her teammates.
While three of her first four goals were assisted, only one of her final seven tallies came off of assists from her teammates.
Additionally, after recording only one assist in her first 11 collegiate games, Purce had three in the final seven contests of the year.
“I would attribute it all to the team and the effort that we all put into practice,” Purce said. “We all understood that we had a goal: to win the Ivy League…. The way that the team helped each other…on small levels and on larger levels was absolutely phenomenal.”
Leone recognizes his star forward’s massive potential and says that her work ethic will undoubtedly make her a better player season after season.
“It was a wonderful season for our team and for Midge,” Leone said. “The exciting part for us is that she can be so much better.”

Despite a strong start to the 2014 season, the Harvard women’s water polo team could not continue its winning ways towards the end, finishing 15-20 overall and 2-3 in the Collegiate Water Polo Association (CWPA) Southern Division.
The beginning of the year saw the Crimson come out of the gate strong against Villanova, Iona, and the Virginia Military Institute, opening up the season at 4-0. At the end of the Princeton Invite, Harvard was 5-1, the program’s best start in three years.
On March 15, the team took its annual trip to California to match up against some of the top squads in the nation. The Crimson ended the trip 3-7, dropping games to teams such as UCLA, San Diego State, and Cal Lutheran. Although the record was not perfect, the team was able to come out of the trip with valuable insight into how to match up against the challenging East Coast competition it would face later in the season.
“UCLA was the number two team in the country, and we stayed with them,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “I thought it was a good trip for us because we got better every day, and we were able to use it as a training trip to focus on the games later in the season.”
Coming back from the California trip, the Crimson recorded significant victories against Mercyhurst and George Washington, though sandwiching those wins were losses to Brown, Bucknell, and Princeton. Over the course of the year, Harvard matched up against Bucknell three times and dropped all three decisions. The Tigers, which were ranked as high as ninth in the country over the course of the season, were also a frequent opponent of the Crimson and were able to defeat Harvard both times they played.
Although initially unsure if it would advance to the CWPA Championships based on its rank, the Crimson did manage to earn a berth and went on to play both Princeton and Bucknell in the tournament. Dropping both games, Harvard fell into the seventh-place game but won the contest against Connecticut College to finish seventh in the tournament.
“We definitely did not want to be in the situation that we ended up [in], because we thought we could be better than that,” senior co-captain Shayna Price said. “But, overall, we gave a lot of heart even though some of the calls didn’t end up going our way.”
Price and two-meter Jelena Cyr were the two senior anchors of the team this year. Having been on the team for all four years that Minnis has been with the Crimson program, Price and Cyr’s absence means next year will be the first time Minnis will coach a Harvard team without them.
“Having senior leadership is always important to a team, and this year’s seniors were different than ones I have had in the past.” Minnis said. “This class has been with me the whole time. Everything I’ve done here, they have been a part of, so they really understand the traditions we have started here.”
Seven rookies joined the team this season and contributed significantly throughout the season. Freshman Melissa Balding was named CWPA Rookie of the Year, ending the season with 45 goals and 13 steals. Two Harvard players received all-conference honors, as sophomore Yoshi Andersen was awarded first-team accolades and Price received second-team recognition. Andersen spearheaded the Crimson’s offense throughout the year, scoring a team-leading 72 goals. Price was not far behind, scoring 58 in her senior campaign.
Although the season did not turn out the way Harvard expected, the team was still able to take away valuable lessons to build upon in the future.
“I think this team played with a lot of heart and overcame a lot of adversity this year that other teams don’t have to deal with,” Minnis said. “I think they did a really good job sticking together through the good times and the bad times.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With 45 minutes left to play, the Harvard women’s soccer team looked to hold onto a 2-0 lead. This exact scenario played out two weeks in a row for the Crimson—the first time against Dartmouth with the Ivy title on the line, the second against Columbia with a perfect Ancient Eight record at stake.
After seeing its lead shrink to one against the Big Green with 25 minutes still left in the second half, the Crimson defense and freshman goalie Lizzie Durack blocked five Dartmouth shots to clinch Harvard’s second Ivy crown in three years.
“I knew that we had won the Ivy title, but I had no idea that the actual trophy would be there that day,” co-captain Peyton Johnson said. “It was really special to get to lift that up on Senior Day at home.”
Just a week later, after surrendering a goal five minutes into the second half, Durack and the defense fought off eight Lion shots to complete Harvard’s first Ivy sweep since 1999 and extend its unbeaten streak to 14 games, the longest such run in program history.
“The team played every minute of every game with everything they had,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “I think that was the unique thing about this group—how they trained, practiced, and played the games.”
For the Crimson, which finished the season 7-0 in the Ancient Eight and 12-4-2 overall, the prospect of an undefeated Ivy record—even a championship title—seemed in jeopardy when the season began.
Harvard opened its campaign with three consecutive losses for the first time since 1996, but a 1-0 win at home against LIU Brooklyn turned its season around and the squad went undefeated over its next 14 games.
The setbacks early on in the year helped the team end up where it did, according to Leone.
“[The losses] taught our team that we need to keep working at it and improving and believing,” Leone said. “All we needed was just that first decent result.”
Harvard built its confidence after breaking a 1-1 tie with Penn in the 79th minute of the conference opener, earning the 2-1 victory.
The matchup against the Quakers was the closest contest for the Crimson in Ancient Eight play until its final two games against Dartmouth and Columbia. In between, Harvard outscored its Ivy opponents, 17-4. This included a 7-2 win against Cornell, which marked the team’s highest offensive output in a single game since 2000.
“We know at Harvard that every Ivy team is out to get us,” co-captain Elizabeth Weisman said. “We always had to be prepared. We all had each other’s backs, and we were all there to support each other and pump each other up before every game.”
The Crimson’s team chemistry reflected that of its leadership. Leone, in his seventh season as Crimson coach, has led Harvard to seven consecutive winning seasons and four Ivy titles. Part of Leone’s and the team’s success comes from the dynamic he has created with the rest of his coaching staff. Leone has coached before with associate head coach Mike Calise, and his two assistant coaches—Chris Hamblin and Kerry Baldwin—also coach a club team together. This extensive experience working together keeps the coaches in the same frame of mind.
“The coaches have helped us achieve a great dynamic,” Weisman said. “They all are amazing at what they do, and are so invested in the team. All of the girls know our coaches are there for us.”
Johnson and Weisman took after their coaches’ styles. The senior duo dedicated a tremendous amount of time and effort to ensuring that they were on top of everything and were helping the team run as smoothly as possible. On the field, both players competed in all 18 games of the season and recorded six assists and six goals, respectively.
“Sometimes the captains and seniors will put too much pressure on themselves,” Leone said. “They really didn’t do that [this year]. They just played hard, smiled everyday, and that really carried through.”
Unfortunately for the Crimson, it fell short against crosstown rival Boston University in the opening round of the NCAA tournament. Harvard tied the Terriers, 1-1, in a nonconference double overtime contest earlier in the season, when Crimson freshman Midge Purce scored the only goal BU allowed at home in its regular season. But Harvard could not find the back of the net in the postseason, and a Terrier goal in the 75th minute of play ended the Crimson’s season.
“It was such an amazing season, so of course we were upset we couldn’t move onto the next round,” Weisman said. “But we were more upset that our season had to end and that this team wouldn’t be playing together anymore.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Harvard wrestling, the 2013-2014 season was a roller coaster of highs and lows from the very beginning. The squad saw injuries, comebacks, upsets, and no shortage of tough competition throughout the year, finishing with an overall record of 4-8 and going 4-7 in EIWA conference competition.
“We had a lot of goals in the beginning of the year, and I don’t think we met all those goals,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “But it definitely was not a disappointment. I really think we kept working and grew as a team this year.”
The Crimson had some of its best performances at the end of its season, as it posted its fourth consecutive top-10 performance at the EIWA Championships, finishing ahead of Princeton and Penn, both of whom beat Harvard in dual meets. Five members of the Harvard squad finished higher than their seeds would have predicted, and the Crimson notched its first 141-pound individual title since 1999 with sophomore Todd Preston’s victory.
“As a team, we gear everything that we do training-wise to peak in March,” Weiss said. “Our guys did exactly that, they did a great job and wrestled at their best at the end in there.”
In the postseason, two different wrestlers—Preston and junior James Fox—represented Harvard at the NCAA Championships.
“On the one hand, I’m glad that we’re still sending guys out there [to the tournament],” Preston said. “But we want to be sending 10 guys, not just two or three, and I know this team has the potential to do that.”
The Crimson’s greatest triumph came in a come-from-behind victory over Boston University at the season’s midway point. Heading into the upper weight classes, Harvard trailed, 15-6.  With just four bouts left, the Crimson rallied to regain the lead, winning all four matches to seal the victory. Harvard sealed the Terriers’ fate with Fox’s fall over Aaron Conrad, and heavyweight Nicholas Gajdzik rounded out the night to secure the win for Harvard, 23-15.
“BU had been hyping up that match,” Preston said. “To beat a good team handily was good for our confidence.”
Another high point for the squad came during its first dual meet victory at Rider, in which seven of the 10 Harvard wrestlers recorded individual wins to propel the Crimson to a 25-13 victory.
“[Rider] was a good team, and it was a fun match to be in,” Weiss said. “We came back and wrestled really well. Individually, I liked how the guys fought.”
The Crimson dealt with a great deal of obstacles, however, as many main players for Harvard were kept off the mats due to injury.
“We were young throughout the whole year, and I think injuries didn’t help us to do our best,” Weiss said. “Having guys like [sophomore] Devon Gobbo and [freshman] Eric Morris hurt really set us back.”
One of the hardest losses for the Crimson came at the hands of Ivy foe Princeton, as Harvard fell to the Tigers, 19-17. The Princeton match came right on the heels of another tight loss to Penn, in which Harvard stumbled at home, 23-15.
“It was really difficult,” Preston said. “But we are a very young team. For our guys who just don’t have the experience of the older guys, it’s really tough.”
The Crimson notched just one win in the Ivy League this season, dropping Brown, 30-10.
“Can we do better? Absolutely we can do better,” Weiss said. “I think we’re well on our way to creating that atmosphere in the future. The next couple years are going to be a lot of fun, because now we’ve established this team culture, and it’s good to know that we’ve set such a strong foundation.”
For the entire squad, the year has been a chance to grow.
“What stands out to me most is when I see individuals making big jumps,” Weiss said. “We had a freshman Tyler Grimaldi who had a lot of success in the beginning of the season, and now realizes how much work our season is. He has become more focused mentally and physically, and that’s what I look for.”
Outside of competition, the Harvard squad garnered honors for being the top academic program in the country, the fourth time that the Crimson has received this award.
“They’re really focused on doing great things off the mat,” Weiss said. “They hold each other to this high standard, on and off the mat, and when you see that happen as a coach, it’s just so much fun. It’s a joy to coach.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard wrestling’s Todd Preston has seen no shortage of tough competition.
The sophomore has matched up against some of the top wrestlers in the country in several tournaments. However, even with this experience under his belt, the toughest match of Preston’s career took place entirely off the mats.
A bout with appendicitis kept the 141-pound 2014 EIWA Champion and 2014 NCAA Championships quarterfinalist away from competition for half of his rookie season.
Having missed several key matches, Preston finished out the year with a record of 3-5.
“As a freshman, he went through a lot,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “Last fall semester, if you had told me he would be an EIWA champ, I’d have told you you’re crazy, just because of what he was going through.”
Preston came back with a vengeance his sophomore year, posting a 25-10 record for the Crimson.
“My health put a huge damper on my freshman season,” Preston said. “But in the end, it was a blessing in disguise. I was able to focus on areas where I needed to focus, and it gave me the time to figure out how to achieve my goals.”
After a solid performance at the Midlands Championship, Preston found his stride. The sophomore registered five consecutive victories at the very start of the season and recorded a 12-match winning streak following his victory in a tough bout against Boston University’s Tyler Scotton.
“He’s one of the hardest workers on the team,” Weiss said. “We knew how talented he was, but he made some mental and physical adjustments, and constantly got better.”
The highlight of Preston’s season, however, came at its conclusion. With a consistently solid performance at the EIWA Championships, Preston advanced to the finals.
He maintained his composure in a whirlwind matchup against Hofstra’s Luke Vaith to claim the crown in a tiebreaker for the Crimson.
“I really think it was the mental adjustment,” Weiss said. “He stopped worrying about a lot of things.”
It was Preston’s ability to move on from last season’s disappointments that served him well in the season-ending tournaments.
“In any sport, you have to have a short term memory, and Todd really did that going into the EIWA Championship,” Weiss said. “I knew it was going to be a good tournament for him because he was in that mindset, and that was fun to watch.”
From there, Preston continued on to the NCAA Tournament. He advanced to the quarterfinals before being eliminated.
“I really stopped setting expectations for myself and stopped putting pressure on myself,” Preston said. “That has made the sport so much more enjoyable for me, and that’s really what it’s all about.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On day three of the NCAA Championships in Columbus, Ohio, the crowd gathered inside Ohio State’s French Field House was silent, but not for a lack of suspense or team support.
In fact, not much other than the commands of the referee, the clashing of metal, and the echoing beeps of the scoring box could be heard during the women’s sabré final.
Standing across the strip from Crimson freshman Adrienne Jarocki was her teammate and friend, sophomore Aliya Itzkowitz.
The practice partners had fenced each other in their first bout of the tournament and, after the grueling 23-bout preliminary round, both found themselves in the top four. After winning their semifinal matchups, they fenced for the title.
“It’s a beautiful situation for the coach, but not so much for the two of them having to fence each other for the title,” Harvard coach Peter Brand said. “It’s a big chess game—these two individuals have fenced each other all year long and know each other really well.”
With Brand and the other coaches obligated to not help one Harvard fencer over the other, second-seed Jarocki and top-seed Itzkowitz were on their own for the final bout of the season.
Though the two-time British Junior World Team member Itzkowitz and the U.S. Junior World Team member Jarocki were tied at seven late in the first period, the latter scored six of the next seven touches to claim the NCAA title in her first collegiate season.
“Fencing Aliya in the finals as opposed to anybody else changed the way I approached the bout,” Jarocki said. “I wasn’t approaching it in a competitive nature, but more like it [was] just another bout in practice, and this was going to be fun…. That day I happened to win, but it could have gone either way.”
While Jarocki’s 18-5 pool play record from the previous two days reflects her stellar performance, it still was just two bout victories more than the cutoff for the final elimination round.
“The problem with the NCAA tournament is that you cannot afford to coast because every touch of every bout counts,” Brand said. “It’s actually quite a trap because if you are lulled into coasting, you’re liable to not make the final four, which has occurred on many occasions.”
Yet both Jarocki and Brand still recognized that the groundwork for the final few days of the collegiate fencing calendar needed to be laid months before the actual event took place.
“This was a challenge, to make sure she was on her A-game for each of those 23 bouts,” Brand said. “So the preparation and the entire year helped her manage that, and she understood the entire game by the time she got to March.”
Jarocki attributed much of her success to the support of her teammates.
“At Harvard in particular…the team aspect of the game is very important and very strong,” Jarocki said. “It brings a new [side] to fencing that I wasn’t used to, and I think that’s why I did so well at NCAAs…. You have not only a dream for yourself, but also for your team.”
Jarocki’s 25th victory of the tournament was just another one of the many the freshman earned throughout the year.
She won the first two bouts of her career against Tufts in December, went 18-0 at the Ivy League Round-Robins, and took home gold with a 20-3 record at the NCAA Northeast Regional before putting on her mask for the NCAA Championships.
“[NCAAs] is a long tournament with two days of preliminary competition [and] she did beautifully,” Brand said. “She won that tournament quite handily, to be honest—she was never really challenged at the final four, and she was poised [and] confident.”
Her win also had historic implications for the Harvard fencing program, which added its first women’s sabré individual title to its resume. Jarocki’s NCAA individual trophy is also the first since outgoing senior Alexandra Kiefer won the women’s foil event three years ago.  
“I’m very proud of her attitude—the way she handled the first year of college and the tremendous amount of pressure that was mounted upon her,” Brand said. “Overall, she’s one of the best fencers that I’ve ever had the pleasure of coaching.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every season has a turning point.
For the Harvard men’s soccer team (7-8-2, 5-2 Ivy), it was a 2-1 loss to Yale in which the team gave up both the tying and game-winning goals within a 120-second span in the final three minutes of play.
Senior midfielder Kevin Harrington described the game as an opportunity for the team to show its resolve or pack it in. Harrington was on the team the last  two seasons when it went winless in Ivy play. The senior attributes that lack of success to letting one loss spiral into more, and focusing only on the result, not on the process.
“You could see an increased energy in practice [the week after the Yale game] in that guys weren’t going to let it be the end of our season,” Harrington said. “The fact that we survived that next week was the turnaround point. In past years, guys have thrown in the towel and, intentionally or not, given up.”
“When you put everything out on the line, sometimes you’re going to lose, but you have to put it all out on the line,” said first-year coach Pieter Lehrer in October, regarding the talk he had with his players after the Yale loss. “That was the result that night, but as we keep putting it out there, the results are going to change in our favor.”
After the Yale game, the team had a season-defining five-game winning streak in conference play. It went on the road to Cornell, the defending league champion, and pulled out a 2-1 double overtime victory on a game-winning header from Harrington.
“From our defense to our bench, everyone contributed to that win,” senior defender Ross Friedman said. “We went ahead early and they tied it up. We went into overtime, and Kevin stepped up and said, ‘Send me the ball.’ Our coach was saying play near point and Kevin said ‘No, give me the ball’.... Sometimes, in order to be great, you have to put yourself out there.”
Harrington’s header in the 102nd minute came off a cross from Friedman and sparked a run to the top of the conference.
In the next four league games, all wins, Harvard’s defense—a point of emphasis all season for Lehrer—allowed just three goals.
The offense, which had been punchless in the early part of the season, came together to post nine goals in five games at one point.
Heading into the final weekend of play, the team was tied atop the league with Penn, which came to visit Soldiers Field with the league title on the line.
Two early goals put the Quakers ahead, and the team’s conservative play after the second goal made the lead stand up, giving Penn the conference crown.
“The loss to Penn was difficult for us, but at the same time everyone realized what we had accomplished,” Friedman said. “We had to look  in the mirror and accept that Penn outplayed us. Some guys were banged up and not every bounce went our way, but we gave it our all. At the end of the day, we hadn’t won a [conference] game in two years, and [at the end of the 2013 season], we were sitting on five [Ivy] wins.”
The team rose and fell on the shoulders of Friedman and Harrington.
Friedman led the league in assists in Ivy League play, putting up 10 in seven games—four more than any other player. Harrington tied for the team lead in goals and shots on goal.
In goal, sophomore Evan Mendez wrested control of the starting job from co-captain Brett Conrad midway through the year and went on to excel, placing second in the league in goals-against-average.
“Evan has been great for the team,” said Friedman after a 2-0 victory over Brown. “He brought a lot of calm to our back line and our play. He has a clear mind and an ability to [control] the game. That’s what a lot of people don’t think about when they think about a goalkeeper: he has got the intangibles and he has the communication aspect of it, which is great.”
The focus all year, however, was not on results but rather on the process. Lehrer put his stamp on the program early on by telling his players to concentrate on the steps leading up to a given contest, and not on the statistics or the results on the scoreboard.
“[Lehrer] came in and there was immediately a switch within the team in the very beginning—a new level of focus and level of detail,” Harrington said. “His whole philosophy is to focus on what we are doing on a daily basis and to really solidify what our goals for the future are and to see what we are doing today to get that goal.”
During the beginning of the season, when the team was struggling to get wins—the Crimson won just once in its first nine games—Friedman said that it was important that the players completely bought into Lehrer’s philosophy.
In past years, players would allow losses to affect practice and their takeaways from games, something Lehrer tried to avoid.
“Everything that we did we focused on how we did it versus the results,” Friedman said. “Sometimes you are not seeing the results [you want], but we continued to do the right things. And at the end of the season, we looked back and could say we really improved and the results changed as we improved.”
Harrington said that he believes that after a recent downturn, the program is back in the right direction under Lehrer.
The Crimson finished in the conference’s top two for the first time since 2009, when it took home the Ivy League title.
Furthermore, the squad brought in the nation’s 34th-ranked recruiting class this year. No other Ancient Eight team was ranked.
“You can just tell that he cares about [the team] more than any single player does, and having a coach behind you that cares about how we are doing not only on a team but on an individual-basis helps a team go forward with confidence,” Harrington said. “I think that this program has a very bright future with him in charge.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Riding the talents of new and newly-established members, the Harvard men’s and women’s fencing teams both made runs at Ivy League titles during the 2013-2014 season. While the Crimson women came up just short of their goal with a second-place conference finish, the men’s side went 4-1 to capture a share of the championship for the second straight year.
A few weeks later, the squads joined together to  compete for a team title at the NCAA combined championships and took fifth place. In a program record, four Crimson men and five women earned All-American honors with top-10 results at the four-day tournament.
“I think we pretty much accomplished what we set out to do,” coach Peter Brand said. “The only goal I thought we had a better shot at doing a little better was at the NCAAs.”
WOMEN’S FENCING
While the team may have broken records at NCAAs, the biggest story of the tournament came as second-seeded Harvard freshman Adrienne Jarocki stared down sophomore teammate and top seed Aliya Itzkowitz for the individual sabré title, marking the first time two Harvard fencers have faced each other in the national tournament final.
A former top-ranked junior, Jarocki calmly took control after falling behind, 6-5, to win the bout, 15-10. The final bout came after Itzkowitz had defeated her in the preliminary pool play round.
“To be able to do this in my freshman year kind of sets the ground for me for the next few years,” Jarocki said. “Since I did it now, I know that I have the ability to do it for the next three years.”
Along with Jarocki and Itzkowitz, captain Alexandra Kiefer and sophomore Isabella DiTella took sixth in foil and épée, respectively, while junior Emily Vaggo finished ninth in épée. The All-American honors for the five were the most in a single season in Harvard history.
The winner of the 2011 NCAA foil event, Kiefer finished with a 16-7 record and a plus-26 differential. Her fourth straight All-American nod tied the Crimson individual record.
“Alex was a tremendous fencer and captain and was someone who worked tirelessly for all four years,” Brand said. “She’s one of the best [Harvard] has ever had.”
A little over a month before NCAAs, the women went 5-1 at the Ivy League Round-Robins, finishing short of the title.
“It definitely [wasn’t] a perfect season, and we would have loved to win that Ivy title,” Itzkowitz said. “We were so close, so I think that was a big disappointment.”
MEN’S FENCING
In the culmination of conference play, the fourth day of the Ivy League Championships at Providence, R.I., proved to be stressful for coaches and fencers alike.
“It was definitely one of those roller-coaster rides,” Brand said. “We only had to win one of the last three bouts against Columbia [for the outright title], but we lost all three.”
Though the Crimson fell to the Lions, 14-13, in its fourth matchup of the competition, a Princeton victory against Columbia left the door open for Harvard to earn a share of the top spot.
And with a 17-10 victory over Brown, the Crimson’s 4-1 record was good enough for the championship split with Columbia.
“We hit our goal with winning the title, but it’s tough to win outright—Columbia’s team was especially strong,” co-captain Michael Raynis said.
Coming into the year, earning a second consecutive Ivy League title looked to be much tougher with the absence of épeéist Peregrine Badger, who took a year off after taking third individually at the NCAA championships in 2013.
“Certainly, [the men’s épée] group was our question right from the outset,” Brand said.
Following the league finals were the NCAA championships, which saw the Harvard men compete against loaded fields that included former Olympians.
But the Crimson men came into the event poised and prepared, and four of the six Harvard fencers earned top-10 finishes.
“Our team dynamic is our best asset,” Raynis said. “At the NCAAs you’re taking what’s basically an individual sport and adapting [it] to a very team-based competition format.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the end of the 2012-2013 season, the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team was hungry for more.
After finishing 9-0 in dual meets, with seven of those wins coming against Ivy opponents, the Crimson fell just short of an Ivy League Championship, finishing second to Princeton, then the four-time defending champions.
But this season, Harvard (8-2, 7-0 Ivy) finally reached the top.
The regular season was similar, with an unbeaten record in the Ivy League and the regular season dual meet title. The difference, however, came in the final stretch, as the team was finally able to end Princeton’s five-year streak and claim the Ivy League Championship title.
With a new coach at the helm, the team knew some things would be different. Before this season, Tim Murphy had led the Crimson for 15 years and coached the team to a 122-11 dual meet record.
But just prior to the start of the year, Murphy announced he would be leaving Harvard for Penn State.
Former assistant coach Kevin Tyrrell stepped up as the interim coach for the year and has since been officially named the head coach for the 2014-2015 season.
“We kind of set a new plan with the captains, senior leadership and the coaches, and worked out a plan for the upcoming year,” co-captain Chris Satterthwaite said. “We reorganized what the team’s priorities were and what the goals were. We worked on prioritizing process-oriented goals rather than outcome-oriented goals, and I think that really helped us achieve what we wanted to do.”
The Crimson faced its first challenge of the season at the end of November against Columbia. Although Harvard did win the meet 170-130, it was a close contest for much of the day.
“Columbia tested us,” Tyrrell said. “[It] was important for our guys to overcome difficulties in the middle of a meet.”
The team’s next competition was also an important milestone, as the Crimson went south to the Texas Invite. This meet gave the team a chance to measure up against top-tier national competition outside of the Ivy League.
“We went to Texas and had a phenomenal invite where a lot of guys had great times on very little rest,” Satterthwaite said. “That was kind of evident that our training was paying off and our plan had been working.”
But the biggest breakthrough of the regular season was the Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet, in which Harvard defeated Princeton, its biggest competition for the regular season and Ivy League titles, as well as the Bulldogs.
Over the course of the meet, the Crimson set six pool records and won 11 of 19 events.
Though the team still had one more meet before Ivy League Championships, the HYP meet gave Harvard momentum as it headed into the championship portion of the season.
The team capped off the exciting season at the Ivy League Championships, breaking through with a major victory in its home pool as the Crimson claimed its first Ivy League title since 2008.
Harvard jumped into the lead from the start, finishing the first day with a 105-point lead over Princeton. The Tigers managed to cut the deficit to 82 over the next two days, but the Crimson never relinquished the top spot on its way to spoiling Princeton’s five-year conference title-winning streak.
Junior Mike Mosca was named Diver of the Meet as he swept both the 1-meter and 3-meter events for the second year in a row.
Freshmen Jack Manchester and Eric Ronda continued their strong rookie campaigns. Manchester claimed pool records in the 200 backstroke and as a member of the 400 freestyle relay, while Ronda took second in both the 100 and 200 back events.
Satterthwaite capped off a strong Harvard career with two individual wins and four relay wins. The co-captain was a consistent swimmer all year long, and will leave a hole for the team to fill next season.
“We graduated an outstanding senior class, particularly sprint freestylers and sprint backstrokers,” Tyrrell said. “We need our underclassmen to take control of those roles. It will be key for us.”
Following the Ivy League Championship, five swimmers and one diver competed at the NCAA Championships. Junior Mike Mosca was the lone diver for the Crimson, while Eric Ronda represented the swimmers individually and senior Danny Crigler, junior Griffin Schumacher, sophomore Jacob Luna, and Manchester competed in four relay events.
The Crimson had a strong showing against national competition, with a pair of top-30 finishes.
According to Tyrrell, beyond all the technical swimming improvements made this year, the most important adjustment was the team coming together as one cohesive unit.
“We really came together as a team,” Tyrrell said. “I think we believed in each other more than we did before, and I think we had a lot of fun as a team throughout the year. That translated into a championship.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Down by one with six seconds left on the game clock, the seniors on the Harvard women’s basketball team watched their final moments in a Crimson uniform tick away.
 After a hard-fought battle with Iona in the first round of the Women’s National Invitational Tournament that saw the Gaels fight back from a double-digit deficit to go ahead in the final seconds, Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith made the decision to put the ball—and the game—in co-captain Christine Clark’s hands.
Clark, whose foul had given Iona the free throw it needed to take a one-point advantage, redeemed herself as the clock counted down. Moments after Gaels guard Aleesha Powell sunk the and-one attempt, the veteran drove down the length of the court, weaved past every Iona defender, and hit an uncontested layup.
“There were six seconds left, and this could be the last six seconds of my college career,” Clark said. “[After the layup], I’m just more in a state of relief that we won rather than realizing that I just did something pretty cool. Everybody was celebrating and super excited, and I’m just standing there trying to breathe because I thought I was going to be the reason we lost.”
The 90-89 victory over Iona sent Harvard (22-8, 11-3 Ivy) into the second round of the WNIT for the third consecutive year, capping a season in which the squad accomplished something it had not done since 2009 in winning at Jadwin Gymnasium against Princeton, who was the Ivy League champion for the past five years.
Princeton’s home court had long been a near-impossible place to win for the Crimson, but in the teams’ first matchup of the season, Clark shook off an early-season injury to post 25 points en route to a 78-68 victory over the Tigers. Junior forward Temi Fagbenle posted a double-double in the victory, adding 13 points and 13 rebounds as Harvard dominated Princeton on the glass to the tune of 15 offensive reboun ds. 
“That was the highlight of the year, absolutely,” Clark said. “That win was monumental...just because we’d come in second place to them for three consecutive years and never beaten them. That win put us on top, put us in the number one spot in the Ivy League.”
But a day later, Harvard gave up its claim atop the conference, posting its lowest shooting percentage of the season at Penn. 
The Quakers, who eventually took home the title, hit just 36.4 percent of its shots, but the Crimson made only 18.3 percent of its attempts, scoring 34 points on the night.
Hopes of winning the championship were dashed a few weeks later, when the Crimson hosted Penn and Princeton at home. Losses to both dropped the Crimson to third in the Ivy League, out of reach of automatic bids to the NCAA tournament and WNIT.
But Delaney-Smith’s squad won the remainder of its regular season games, and the team’s performance did the trick—on Selection Monday, the Crimson received an at-large bid to the WNIT, marking its third consecutive trip to the tournament and the first time any Ancient Eight team earned an at-large bid to the WNIT outside.
An injury-depleted Crimson squad fell to Rutgers in the second round of the WNIT, 63-52, marking the end of a season in which the team fell short of its most important goal—winning an Ivy League championship. 
The team has not won the title since the 2008 squad split the title with Cornell and Dartmouth.
“I think all teams have [injuries], we have an extraordinary amount of sort of chronic injuries that need to be managed,” Delaney-Smith said. “That always takes its toll, but we were good enough and deep enough that we should have been able to reach our ultimate goal of winning the title.”
Despite the disappointments, the season was marked by a number of individual and team accomplishments, including Delaney-Smith’s 515th career victory, a stat that makes the longtime Harvard coach the all-time winningest Ivy League basketball head coach. The 22 wins of the squad were the most of any of Delaney-Smith’s Harvard teams. 
On the defensive end of the floor, the team was led by senior guards Melissa Mullins and Jasmine Evans. The teammates combined for 2.5 steals a game, harassing opponents on the perimeter. Behind Mullins and Evans, Fagbenle was a force inside, leading all Ivy League players by averaging 9.3 rebounds per game during conference play. 
In her final season playing at Lavietes Pavilion, Clark totaled 446 points to become the fourth all-time leading scorer in program history with 1,711 points. The senior, who has garnered numerous accolades during her time in a Crimson uniform, plans to play abroad after graduation.
“Clarkie, from the day she stepped on Harvard[‘s campus], was a role model for her work ethic, she’ll go through the walls for you,” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s an incredibly intense competitor—a talented, hardworking, player. And because of that, she broke a lot of records and was one of the best to wear the uniform she’s in.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard claimed the 2014 Ivy League Women’s Swimming and Diving Championship back in February, coach Stephanie Wriede Morawski '92 didn’t attribute the win to any individual performances.
She instead characterized the victory as a test of the team’s ability to respond to adversity, with the swimmers and divers finding strength in one another at the Crimson’s most important meet of the year.
“Everyone had a role to play on the team, and roles can change at any given point, but the team comes first,” Morawski said. “Every individual is secondary to the greater good of the team. That has to be the way it is if you’re going to try and win a championship. They really believed it.”
Harvard won the championship in 2012, but after going undefeated the folowing year, lost the title to Princeton.
“I think we were the fastest team in the Ivy League last year,” Morawski said. “When we were challenged for the first time in the Championships [last year], they didn’t know what to do. This year, when we lost the first meet of the season [to Columbia], it was an eye opener for all of them and the expectations were off. [The upperclassmen] kept looking at what they were doing, and looking long-term and knew they were going to be working on the process all the way through.”
The Crimson faced challenges all season long, including injuries and illnesses, but the squad’s success can be attributed to overcoming these obstacles.
“It was people pulling through and grabbing points or picking people up in spirit,” co-captain Deirdre Clute said. “We had the strongest team that faced the most adversity that I’ve seen in four years, and was better because of it and was the best because of it.”
Recognizing that seniors essentially shape the team, the captains and coach emphasized the importance of cohesiveness from the start, divvying up responsibilities to ensure every member contributed to the team’s collective performance throughout.
“I just felt lucky to be in a class with some of the most amazing girls that I have ever met in my entire life,” Clute said. “Our goal of the season was to make sure that we showcased the best form of unity and strength as a senior class as we could, so hopefully it would spread to future classes. We have a lot of different personalities, and we just found where our strengths and weaknesses were.”
After the slow start, the turning point was the team’s annual Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet, from which the Crimson emerged victorious for the third year in a row.
“After training abroad and then on campus during J-term, the ball was rolling,” co-captain Dani Schulkin said. “We were fighting hard because we knew what it felt like to lose to Columbia, and we didn’t want to do that again. And the night before [Ivies], there were motivational talks and tears. You could feel the energy running through our hands, our fingers, our hearts.”
Although the swimmers may have had rocky start at the Championships, the divers stepped up on day one. Freshman Elina Leiviskä, senior Alex Stanton, junior Schuyler Moore and classmate Cassie Corneau all placed in the top eight of the 1-meter dive.
“[The divers] gave us enough points to keep our heads up and keep pushing through the rest of the meet,” Clute said. “That was one of the keys to our success this year.”
Sophomore Danielle Lee contributed to the team’s victory by qualifying for the NCAA Division I Swimming and Diving Championships. But her performance, personal best times in the 100 and 200 backstroke events and the butterfly, left no one in shock.
“To go those times, you have to do even more amazing things in practice,” Schulkin said. “As wonderful and as excited as I was when Danielle Lee got 52.77 [in the 400 medley relay performance at Ivies], I wasn’t necessarily surprised. I was just proud that her hard work in the water shined.”
Putting the emphasis on the team’s efforts as a whole, both Schulkin and Clute recognized a shift in mentality that carried them through the entirety of the season.
“We didn’t walk in there and win because we knew we were going to win and we were the best,” Clute said. “We won because we were the strongest, and we were the ones that could push through, and we came together as a team more than I’ve ever seen us do.”
After a successful season, Clute believes the team can repeat as champions next year.
“If we keep our focus on ourselves, and what we do best as a team, then I have no doubt that we can handle whatever is thrown our way and whatever comes next year because our team is strong enough that we can push through anything when we stick together,” Clute said.

He may have been one of the youngest members of the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team but that didn’t stop freshman Eric Ronda from making a splash in his rookie year. In his inaugural season for the Crimson, Ronda quickly adjusted to the fast-paced tempo of collegiate swimming.
Ronda was the only swimmer on the Ivy League Championship squad to qualify individually for the 2014 NCAA Division I Swimming and Diving Championships, competing in the 100 and 200 breaststroke races.
Ronda’s high school swimming career prepared him well to compete on a national stage against some of the nation’s best swimmers.
“Eric was very fortunate that he’s been on the U.S. National Junior Team, so he had a high level of experience before he got here,” Harvard coach Kevin Tyrrell said. “So that made the transition easier for him.”
Despite his impressive swimming resume, the rookie still had to make adjustments transitioning into Tyrrell’s program.
“He’s very talented and he’s very strong but he isn’t particularly efficient,” Tyrrell said. “He learned how to do a better job at controlling his stroke, which made him go faster.”
In the season’s first meet against Dartmouth and Cornell, Ronda also earned his first wins of his collegiate career by claiming the top of the podium in the 100 and 200 breast. The pair of victories was Ronda’s first of three sweeps on the season of his two primary events. In the final dual meet of the season, Ronda swept the events for a third time against Penn with a time of 56.73 seconds in the 100 breast.
Facing top-tier talent, Ronda’s 11th place finish in the 200 breast at the Texas Invite gave him the chance to compete on a national stage during the regular season, and he finished with a time of 1:58.60.
But the freshman’s best time in the 200 breast came at the Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet, arguably the most important meet of the regular season, as the victory enabled the Crimson to capture the Ivy League regular season title. Ronda’s time of 1:57.13 was a personal best and broke Yale’s pool record by almost a full second.
Ronda also contributed crucial points to the team’s Ivy League Championship victory. The freshman took second in both the 100 and 200 breast events, falling to Dartmouth’s Nejc Zupan, who was the only other Ivy League qualifier for the NCAA Championships.
“Learning to swim for different coaches is always a transition, and he adjusted by the end of the season but he had some ups and downs during the year,” Tyrrell said.
All the hard work and training from the regular season showed in strong swims at the national championships. Ronda finished 28th in the 200 breast with a time of 1:56.15 and took 39th in the 100 breast, clocking in at 54.4. Though he did not qualify for the finals in either event, the meet was an important learning experience to cap off a season of adjustments.
Along with his strong individual performances throughout the season, equally significant was Ronda’s ability to find his role on the team.
“High school swimming is a much more individual sport,” co-captain Chris Satterthwaite said. “A lot of it is about chasing after your best time to get recruited by colleges and putting yourself on the map. Ronda did a very good job about embracing the goals of the team and really embracing the bigger ideal. He is an incredibly hard worker, which we saw in and out of the pool every day.”
The Greenwich, Conn. native was also a member of the often-victorious 200 and 400 medley relay teams, swimming the breaststroke leg of each race.
With a year of college swimming under his belt, the coaching staff is expecting even bigger things from him next year as he has already improved leaps since he entered the pool in September.
And with a strong senior class graduating, Ronda looks to play an even bigger role in the Crimson’s future success. Being one of just a few swimmers on the team with NCAA experience, others will be looking to him as a role model. Ronda’s success will perhaps show how a newcomer can make a splash in his first season with the Crimson.

For the Harvard skiing team, winter break is spent in a cabin in Vermont, with each skier training hard to prepare for the season against the top competition in the nation.
“The ski team is very small,” said sophomore and incoming captain Samantha Udolf. “We start training in November and go out to Colorado. We spend all of January in Vermont.”
This intense training is necessary for the team to match up against many skiers who are on the World Cup circuit or on the Olympic level.
For the men’s alpine team—a young team consisting of six sophomores and freshmen—this season was about catching up and learning to race to the fullest of each skier’s potential while overcoming nagging injuries.
“This year was better than last year,” said sophomore Simon Merryweather, an incoming captain. “I think the next two years should be an improvement over the past two.”
“People put in more effort [last] summer because they realized what it took,” he added.
While the team did not qualify any skiers for nationals, it achieved marginal successes, including finishing every run in the Slalom event at regionals.
Merryweather finished 51st in the giant slalom, making him the top representative for the Crimson.
Freshman James Stevenson led the way in the slalom event, finishing in 1:45.13, good for 52nd place.
The Crimson women’s alpine squad led a strong, competitive season despite its small size.
Captain Rebecca Nadler, who two years ago became the first skier in Harvard history to win an NCAA title, has consistently shown that it is possible to be a competitive Harvard skier on the national stage.
Once again, Nadler had a successful year, placing 16th in slalom and 8th in giant slalom at regionals to qualify for nationals.
There she earned All-American honors in the giant slalom, placing sixth out of 34 entrants.
She placed 20th in the slalom, a 12- position jump from her start position.
Freshman Katie Gibson placed 33rd  at regionals.
Harvard’s nordic team had a successful carnival season as well, putting two of its skiers in position to qualify for nationals going into the final weekend of the regular season in Middlebury, Vt.
On the women’s side, senior Jen Rolfes had a solid carnival season, marking a vast improvement from her junior season performance and securing her spot in the NCAA Championships before regionals began.
She finished 12th that weekend in the women’s 5k classic, earning her All-East recognition.
For the men’s team, junior Akeo Maifeld-Carucci and senior Chris Stock both qualified for nationals.
Maifeld-Carucci was well on his way to qualifying before the final weekend at Middlebury, but the fate of Stock was less certain.
Fortunately for the skier, a 39th place finish gave him just enough points to head to nationals.
At nationals in Park City, Utah, Rolfe missed the cutoff for the top 10, finishing in 17th in the classic 5K.
In the 15K, the senior finished in 43:03.00, a time that slipped her into 23rd overall.
After the 2012-2013 season in which the only Harvard skier at nationals finished 15 spots behind her bib spot, the team as a whole improved greatly this year.
As a squad, the Crimson finished 14th in a field of 23 at nationals. Harvard racers managed to earn points in five of the six races in which they competed.
Going forward, the team will have to replace Nadler, the most decorated skier in Crimson history.
“[Nadler] put Harvard skiing on the map,” Udolf said.
Nadler’s example, however, will live on in the team’s memory and the squad’s training.
“The team will miss her tremendously,” Udolf explained. “[Nadler] has definitely been a role model for the entire team.  Everybody has looked up to her—not only on the slopes, but off of it as well.”
With the continued work, the squad is hoping to build the program and qualify more skiers for national competition in the future.
“I think ultimately the goal is always to qualify kids for NCAAs,” Merryweather explained.
“We’ve had a lot of problems with being able to race as well as we trained,” Merryweather added.
“So I think we have to get ourselves in the correct mentality so that both the practice and competitive runs can link up with each other, and we can race as well as we train.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It all started with a crazy goal, one that even his coach thought should be reduced to a more “realistic” feat at the time.
Maksim Korolev wanted to be among the top five finishers at the NCAA Championships. A year after placing 201st in the field of 245 runners—well behind the top 40 places that allow an athlete to garner All-American status—Korolev came back determined not only to improve his placement, but to put himself amongst the top runners in the nation.
“[Korolev] approached me and said he wanted to be top-five at nationals,” Crimson coach Jason Sartesky said. “I tried to talk him down [and said], ‘Start by being All-American, top-40’.”
After an inconsistent and disappointing junior year, Korolev came into the season determined to make sure that this campaign was not plagued by the same mistakes. His preparation started before the season, as Korolev and co-captain James Leakos underwent an intense training regimen together. The hard work quickly played dividends, as Korolev and Leakos dominated early on in the season with a one-two finish versus Yale, as well as top-15 finishes for both at the Paul Short Invitational.
But after Leakos sustained a leg injury in the final stretch of the season, Korolev was left to lead the team, a role that he quickly embraced. Building on a solid start, Korolev placed second in the prestigious Wisconsin Adidas Invitational in a field full of All-Americans. After dominating the regular-season Ivy League races, the senior would go on to win the individual title at the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships and the NCAA Northeast Regionals, helping the team qualify for NCAA nationals for the first time since 1979.
It was there that Korolev would shine his brightest, despite unfavorable conditions. In addition to a stacked field, the conditions of the course were not conducive to an easy performance.
“It was incredibly muddy, windy, and cold out there, and I think that got to a lot of people,” Korolev said in November. “I remember thinking at one point, ‘Wow, I can see over all of these guys,’ but I still tried to draft.”
With his goal in place, Korolev started the race unfazed, starting strong and establishing himself in the lead pack early on along with about nine other runners. At the 3000-meter mark, Korolev found himself right where he wanted to be—inside the top five. The senior crossed the mark at 8:27.8—just a half-second behind defending champion Kennedy Kithuka, the leader at the time.
Korolev stayed in the front group until just before the halfway mark. At that point, the leaders began to break away from the pack in order to pick up the pace. It was here that Korolev made arguably his most crucial decision. Instead of pushing, he stayed behind and kept himself at a pace that he could maintain while staying within striking distance.
“I just gauged the situation, and I felt like [running with Kithuka] would have pushed me over the edge a little bit.” Korolev said in November. “I was happy with where I was in the top five, so I decided to be a little more conservative about it, rather than do something crazy.”
The maturity that the senior demonstrated in that moment reflected the mentality that Korolev had adapted to help him avoid inconsistencies in his running.
“He really [allowed] himself to get out of most difficulties by not always pushing as hard as he [could] earlier on,” Saretsky said.
This decision proved key for Korolev, as he would never drop from the top four for the rest of the race, clocking in at third place at the 8000-meters mark before unleashing his powerful kick.
With a reserve of energy in tow, Korolev finished out the race with a quick 6:04 2000 meters, the fifth-fastest closing time of all runners.
With eventual winner Edward Cheserek out of sight and about 100 meters left, Korolev found himself within striking distance of Kithuka. Though he managed to reel the Texas Tech runner closer and closer, Korolev just ran out of room, finishing a half-second behind the defending champion. But his time of 29:59 made him the top American runner in the race and was the best finish by an Ancient Eight runner in NCAA Championships history.
Korolev claims that a large reason for his success this year was his new perspective and approach to the races.
“Last year it was a little too stressful, and I let the pressure get the best of me,” Korolev said. “[This year] I was more relaxed. I just had more fun with it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although nearly every other Harvard team has wrapped up its season, it is not yet over for the men and women of the Crimson sailing team, which qualified for ICSA National Semifinals by coming in ninth in the Coast Guard Alumni Bowl last month. This marks an improvement from last season, when the Crimson failed to qualify.
Throughout the year, the squad has competed in over 50 regattas along the north Atlantic coast, and twice Harvard has come in first place.
Both top finishes were in regattas hosted by the Crimson on its home waters of the Charles River.
Harvard did not earn a berth to nationals until the final weekend of the regular season.
“We started the year off strong with many top finishes, but ended up faltering a bit towards the end of the fall.” junior Michael Drumm said. “However, we regrouped during our winter break and came out strong [enough] to have good finishes and qualify for nationals.”
In addition to making the national championship, Harvard also had three sailors named for all-NEISA teams in the same regatta: senior Isabel Ruane, junior Brian Drumm, and sophomore Jake Bradt.
Sailing World has the Crimson currently ranked at No. 13 in the nation as it heads into the end of its season.
“These achievements were the product of a full year of hard work by over 30 people—freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors,” sophomore co-captain Andrew Mollerus said.
“Through [the team’s] tireless work and determination, we managed to create a culture of growth which will serve the team long into the future,” Mollerus said.
The end of the fall season was filled with mixed results for Harvard.
For two weekends in a row in six regattas, the Crimson couldn’t finish better than 11th place. One bright spot came in early November, when freshman Juan Carlos Perdomo came in second place for the singlehanded nationals.
The winter proved to be a brutal one in Cambridge, and the Charles River thawed two weeks later than it normally does.
Harvard thus struggled to get time on the water and was left to make up practicing with chalk talk.
This lack of practice on the river proved a challenge for the squad as it headed into the spring season, according to Michael Drumm.
“We specifically focused on our mental approach to sailing and working as a team,” Michael Drumm said.  “[We found] great success.”
The two regattas in the opening weekend of the spring season, the Sharpe and Wood Trophies, were both scheduled to be hosted by the Crimson, but were canceled due to the unseasonably cold weather.
Two weeks later, the weather also led to the calling off of Central Series Two, the final cancellation of the year.
But for the Crimson, warmer weather brought better racing, as Harvard placed in the top 10 in every regatta except three.
“I’m proud of how we were able to come together as a team to put good results up and to set ourselves up to put a good foot forward in nationals,” Michael Drumm said.
Mollerus credits the team’s coaches, Michael O’Connor and assistant Bern Noack, for the squad’s success.
“Of course, none of this would have been possible without the two best coaches in the country, Mike and Bern,” Mollerus said. “They rallied us, pushed us, and drove us to be the best sailors we could be.  The team is extremely grateful.”
In its time off from competition before nationals on June 3rd, Harvard has a few scrimmages lined up to keep its movements fresh on the water.
“All this said, we know that there are many challenges ahead of us,” Mollerus said. “With three weeks until nationals, we each have many points to hammer out, many skills to hone. The entire team is excited for the next three weeks of intensive training that will include scrimmages against Boston College, Dartmouth, and Yale.”
After nationals, the Crimson squad will shut down competition for the summer. While Harvard is graduating a number of sailors, nine rising seniors will return to lead the younger members of the team.
“I am incredibly proud of the team’s achievements and growth this season, and look forward to the incredible effort our sailors will exhibit in the coming weeks,” Mollerus said. “The sky is the limit.”

With the disappointment of not meeting expectations last season weighing heavily, the Harvard field hockey team is already looking forward to the fall with a new mentality and concrete goals in mind.
“Last year was more of a transition period,” said incoming co-captain Caroline Code of the team’s 2012 season, referencing the addition of then-new coach Tjerk van Herwaarden.
“We had to start over with fundamentals and smaller things,” Code added. “This year, we started to see a lot more progress in bigger games and strategies. Our goals [for 2014] are stretching the field, pulling wide, and just having more tactics.”
The Crimson ended its 2013 campaign with an 8-9 record, a marked improvement from the squad’s 3-13 record the previous season.
Harvard also posted a 2-5 record against Ivy League competition, with a pair of wins bookending its Ancient Eight schedule.
After early losses during its nonconference competition, the Crimson opened Ivy League play with a 3-2 win over Yale, which was a standout victory according to incoming co-captain and junior midfielder Caitlin Rea.
“When we get pumped and we know we have nothing to lose, we work well under the pressure of good teams,” Rea said.
Van Herwaarden said the game against the Bulldogs was especially important for the seniors, who had never defeated Yale.
With goals coming from three different players, the game helped the entire team realize its potential early in the season.
An internationally recognized field hockey coach, van Herwaarden recently led Team USA’s women’s field hockey program in the 2014 Champions Challenge, in which the team earned a gold medal at the beginning of May.
“He tries to incorporate some of the things he learns from [coaching the US women’s team] into our programs,” Rea said. “He’s good at keeping us accountable, making us think about what we were doing [when we won], and getting us in the right mind frame again.”
Harvard’s second Ivy League win came in its final contest of the season against Columbia, its first victory over the Lions since 2007.
Although the Crimson had a slow start, which set up a one-goal deficit, the team tied Columbia during regulation, 1-1.
Sophomore Elizabeth Jacobson scored her second goal of the contest for the win, netting the score in the first two minutes of overtime.
“The game against Columbia wasn’t a pretty game, but [was decided by] hard work, overall mentality, and which team wanted it more,” said van Herwaarden of the 2-1 overtime victory. “We tied the game up when we were playing a man down with three minutes left on the clock. There was a real desire to win.”
Jacobson scored six goals this season and recorded the game-winner in overtime against Fairfield in a nonconference victory.
Forward Marissa Belleza was the Crimson’s leading scorer this year with 12 goals, twice as many as any other teammate.
The freshman also posted a team-high four assists, garnering second team All-Ivy accolades in her first season for Harvard.
“I think this year’s freshmen really pushed the upperclassmen to step up,” Code said. “As a freshman coming in, you’re always trying to get a spot. They came in strong and fit, talented and skilled, and just having that extra push made everyone else want to work to their potential as well.”
While she watched the freshmen improve their game on the field this past year, Rea hopes to encourage their vocal presence next year.
“They’ve stepped it up play-wise, but now they’re stepping it up with communication, too, which is huge,” Rea said. “Being in the backfield and having a freshman shout at you that you’re not on your mark is what we need. And the fact that that’s happening now is so helpful. If you see something, you need to let people know.”
The Crimson players typically arrive on campus right before their season begins, leaving each athlete with the responsibility of staying in shape over the summer and preparing for the year ahead.
“We want to work on getting the team in the right mindset,” Rea said.
“We have the capabilities,” she added. “We bring it so well in some games, and then in other games, we lose it. We’re trying to get a constant mindset coming into every game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This would be so much easier if I were writing a recap of a cross country meet.
I’d wait for the meet results to be posted online, scan them for Harvard athletes and determine the team’s top performers, and then conduct a couple of interviews and write the recap.
I was taught to focus on the key details and standout performances from the meet results, and after three years of covering the Harvard cross country and track and field teams, it became second nature.
This parting shot asks me to do something similar, but incredibly more difficult: to reflect on my time on The Crimson and at Harvard and pick out the key details and standout memories.
As a former cross country and track and field beat writer, I’ll remember Maksim Korolev and James Leakos’ incredible senior seasons, the women’s track and field team’s Indoor Heps title at Gordon Indoor Track, and Nico Weiler and Martina Salander placing among the nation’s best athletes at the NCAA Championships.
As a former Crimson Sports comp director, I’ll remember hiding scavenger hunt clues in The Coop, accompanying my compers to surprisingly intense field hockey games, dinners with the compers and my co-comp director, and, of course, The Centurion.
And as a former Harvard College student (sad face), I’ll remember the time when we almost accidentally burned down Dewolfe, when I woke up with pinkeye on freshman move-in day, when my blockmates became the biggest band on campus, my freshman River Run (oops), and, of course, the boy dance parties.
These memories are great, but as I see them listed in front of me, I can’t help but feel that so much of the story of my undergraduate career is missing.
Focusing on the significant moments is a perfectly fine way to recap a cross country meet, but it’s a pretty terrible way to summarize a four-year, life-changing experience.
So as I prepare to leave the Harvard bubble and enter the real world, I’ll take both the large and small memories with me. The late-night study sessions and the parties, the basketball games and the Sports Board meetings, and all of the hilarious, miserable, debaucherous, and unforgettable moments in between.
A huge thank you to everyone who helped me navigate this place for four years. It’s been a hell of a ride.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Track is a sport defined by its metrics: how many seconds it takes to run 100 meters, or how many meters an athlete can throw a discus. But for the Harvard track and field team, two numbers in particular stood out in the 2013-2014 season.
One of those numbers, 19, represents the number of records rewritten by the men’s and women’s squads throughout the indoor and outdoor seasons. The other, two, indicates the number of Ivy League championships won by the women’s program, which claimed the top spot in both the Indoor and Outdoor Heptagonal meets.
“The ultimate goal for this program is for both the men and women to be competing for the triple crown at Heps,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said.
At the Indoor Heptagonal meet, the women dominated, beating out host Dartmouth on their way to totaling 122 points, the most in program history. Senior Adabelle Ekechukwu nearly surpassed her own Ivy League record in the weight throw on her way to winning her second straight Ivy League title, for which she was named the meet’s Most Outstanding Performer. Junior Danielle Barbian also took the opportunity to rewrite the history books, breaking the conference record in the 60-meter dash.
Coming off a strong cross country season, senior Maksim Korolev continued to shine indoors. After earning the highest-ever finish at the cross country nationals by an Ivy League runner, Korolev claimed the Ivy records in both the indoor 3K and 5K races.
“[The break between cross country and track] is not a lot of time to regroup, but it’s tough,” Korolev said. “It’s definitely hard to keep rolling, but ...we’re always competing year round. It’s difficult but you just kind of have to do it.”
After the men’s team managed a third-place finish for the third straight year at Indoor Heps, Korolev, alongside fellow co-captain James Leakos and junior Erika Veidis, competed at the Indoor National Championships. Though the three did not have their strongest performances, the competition marked another chance to show that Harvard track can compete against some of the country’s top schools.
Though the teams are still competing in championship meets through June, neither squad showed any signs of slowing down its momentum as it moved into the outdoor season. The women won five individual events on their way to claiming the Outdoor Heptagonal Championships.
Barbian, junior Ashley Collinsworth, freshman Jade Miller, and sophomore Autumne Franklin broke the Ivy League record in the 4x100m relay, scorching the rest of the field with a winning time of 45.40 seconds. Freshman Nikki Okwelogu continued her impressive rookie campaign with a throw of 16.03m in the shot put, shattering the old school record by over a meter on her way to winning the Ivy title.
“In the past couple of weeks, my form has been coming together,” Okwelogu said after the meet. “I’m just glad it manifested in this meet where it counts.”
On the men’s side, freshman Elliot Safo had one of the meet’s top performances, breaking a 93-year-old record in the long jump. Overall, the men finished in third place, the same result they achieved in the Indoor Heptagonal Championship. But the team has high hopes for the future.
“Seeing what the women have accomplished, [the men] have closed the gap where they are very much in the hunt [for a Heps title],” Saretsky said.
Senior Hannah Mayer continued the team’s record-breaking ways a week later at the IC4A/ECAC Championships with a throw of 48.15m in the javelin, which earned her first place.
Despite the loss of seniors such as Mayer, both squads have several top performers returning next year, and the team has no expectations of slowing down.
“When I look at those record setting performances, I think about how many are also Ivy League record setting performances, like Maks Korolev in the indoor 3K and the 5K, Danielle Barbian in the indoor 60 and the outdoor 100, Adabelle {Ekechukwu] with her weight throw,” Saretsky said. “To be setting Ivy League all-time records is just really remarkable and incredibly special.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In cross country, where each runner’s talent is measured by the ticking of a clock, there are no grey areas: you are either fast, or you are not.
For the members of the Harvard cross country team, 2013 was the year in which they proved just how fast they could go, as both the men’s and women’s squads demonstrated that they could be competitive on the national level.
Co-captain Maksim Korolev led the charge for the men’s team all year, racing in the top spot for a Crimson team that was able to qualify for the NCAA Championships for the first time since 1979.
On a cold and windy day in Terre Haute, Ind., Korolev tore through the muddy 10K course with a time of 29:59.5, capping his Harvard career with a third-place finish at nationals—the best placing in Ivy League history.
Pushing Korolev all season long was fellow co-captain James Leakos, who began the season with two big wins in the Harvard-Yale meet and at the Paul Short invitational.
But Leakos battled injuries for the rest of the season.
While he managed to finish the national meet, Leakos found himself in the bottom half of the field with the rest of the Harvard harriers, unable to reach the same heights as his co-captain and competition.
Despite Leakos’ lackluster finish, Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said he gained a lot by racing at nationals.
“It was a great experience for those guys,” Saretsky said after the race. “Obviously, the conditions were less than ideal, and it’s unlike any other race we have been to...But I thought we gained a lot of experience from it, and there’s a real hunger to get back [to nationals] and cement this program[’s place] as a national-caliber program.”
On the women’s side, the team was unable to match the men’s success, just missing out on making it back to nationals for the second consecutive season.
However, the Crimson did break into the national rankings for the first time since 1995 after finishing third in the Heptagonal Championships and seventh at the Paul Short Invitational, the latter a six-place improvement on the previous year’s result.
Junior Viviana Hanley improved on her strong sophomore season with an exceptionally consistent third-year effort. After starting the season with a one-second victory against Yale to lead the team to a 20-39 win, Hanley established herself as the team’s top female runner.
Senior captain Morgan Kelly also finished the season with several impressive results, providing her Harvard squad with a solid one-two punch in every race.
The teams got a chance to compete against some of the country’s top runners a few weeks later at the Wisconsin Adidas Invitational.
Kelly led the way for the women, while Korolev finished second behind eventual NCAA champion Edward Cheserek, firmly placing himself in the national conversation and establishing himself as a strong contender for the NCAA championship. Overall, the men finished just 13th of 35, the first time all season to that point that the Crimson had finished outside the top third at a meet.
“The meet that really got us to nationals was Wisconsin, when we beat nationally-ranked teams,” Korolev said. “That was probably our best showing as a team.”
At the Heptagonal championships, the women’s squad repeated last year’s result with its  third-place finish, while Korolev led the men’s team to a fourth-place showing.
Korolev’s time of 23:28.2 in the 8k race was good for an Ivy League record, besting the old mark by more than 13 seconds.
Though the team will be losing Korolev and Leakos next year, the Crimson men will look to strong runners such as sophomore Tom Purnell and juniors Will Geiken, Adam Cotton, and Nephat Maritim.
Hanley will be the women’s top returner in her senior season.
“For cross country, without a doubt we want to be able to compete for a Heps title,” Saretsky said. “We’ve seen the women’s team for track do it…. The men’s and women’s cross country  [teams] would love to have that opportunity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With its third straight NCAA Tournament appearance and second consecutive trip to the third round, the 2013-2014 Harvard men’s basketball team (27-5, 13-1 Ivy) proved that Cinderella can wear the slipper twice.
The team bore the weight of expectations all season—if last year’s team was characterized by coach Tommy Amaker’s statement “We may not have had what we had, but we have enough,” this year’s team was known for an embarrassment of riches. Six different players were named to All-Ivy teams, while three-star recruits and potential All-Ivy talent populated the bench.
“They won because they had depth and could afford injuries,” said Yale coach James Jones after Harvard clinched the Ivy League title on his team’s home floor. “If [sophomore point guard] Siyani [Chambers] is injured, you have [co-captain] Brandyn [Curry] on the bench. How many teams have a first or second team All-Ivy guy on the bench?”
Last year’s team was good enough to get the school’s first-ever NCAA Tournament win, but also enough to raise the hype to unforeseen levels for Ivy League teams. Enough to garner preseason AP Top 25 votes and cause the team to be unanimously predicted to repeat as Ancient Eight champion. Enough, even, to be tapped by one ESPN analyst to make the Final Four.
The expectations were not without reason. After a year off, Harvard welcomed back senior forward Kyle Casey and Curry—both All-Ivy talents. The freshman class included top-100 recruit Zena Edosomwan, the first player of such status to choose Harvard. The team had lost only one senior—Christian Webster ’13—from the previous year’s squad, and he returned to the bench as an assistant coach.
The challenge with an abundance of riches was to find balance and define roles.
“We know how important it’s going to be for everyone to sacrifice something of themselves for the greater good,” Amaker said before the season.
The team was defined by its ability to share responsibilities early. In its first five games, four different players led the Crimson in scoring. Harvard rattled off four victories to start the season before its first setback, a 70-62 loss at Colorado in which the Crimson led by 12 at the break.
After the loss to the Buffs, Harvard would not lose again for nearly six weeks. Along the way, the Crimson swept Denver, Green Bay, and TCU to take home the Carrs/Safeway Great Alaska Shootout title.
The team hit a bump in the road after the winning streak, dropping two of three for the only time all season with road losses to eventual national champion Connecticut and Florida Atlantic. After the FAU loss—the worst program defeat in the last three years—the team rallied for Ivy League play, running off five straight wins to begin the year.
Then came Yale. The Bulldogs came into Cambridge on Feb. 8 and broke the Crimson’s 20-game winning streak at Lavietes Pavilion with a 74-67 victory that evened their record with that of Harvard atop the Ivy League.
“I know this group, and we will respond,” Curry said afterwards.
Indeed, the team emerged from the Yale loss with a renewed sense of urgency. It won in double-overtime at Columbia, overcoming 34 points from Lions junior Alex Rosenberg. A week later, it went to Princeton and did something it had not done in 25 years—win at Jadwin Gymnasium. Despite falling down by nine points early, the Harvard defense put the clamps on the Tiger offense, which shot just 34 percent, in a 12-point Crimson victory.
With the finish line in sight—all the Crimson needed to do to clinch its fourth straight Ivy League title was win out—Harvard played its best basketball of the season. On the season’s penultimate weekend, it crushed Cornell and Columbia by a combined 58 points at home. It clinched the title with a 12-point revenge victory over the Bulldogs in which it led buzzer-to-buzzer.
“I think we’ve shown that we have been the best team in our league,” Amaker said after beating Yale.
For its 26 wins, the Crimson was rewarded with a 12 seed by the NCAA Selection Committee, matched up with the fifth-seeded Cincinnati Bearcats. Led by senior guard Sean Kilpatrick, the Bearcats played a bruising defensive style of basketball. In the regular season, Cincinnati had taken out defending champion Louisville and cracked the nation’s top 10 before a late season swoon.
Harvard entered the matchup as a popular underdog. From Seth Davis to President Obama, many pundits had the Crimson as their trendy second-round upset pick. If the year before had been about being underestimated, this year was about the weight of expectations.
However, Harvard delivered once again with a 61-57 victory over the Bearcats. Chambers had five of his 11 points in the final two minutes, while Harvard set a program record with 27 wins.
“They’ve got real players,” said Cincinnati coach Mick Cronin after the game. “If it wasn’t for two slip-ups…you’re talking about a team that would have been 30-0.”
The Crimson’s season would end in the next round, however, at the hands of Michigan State. The No. 4-seeded Spartans were a popular pick to win it all and showed it in the first half, jumping out to a 12-point lead behind a flurry of transition points from junior forward Branden Dawson.
In the second half, the Crimson went small—with four guards surrounding junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi inside—to kickstart a 19-3 run that gave Harvard its only lead of the game, 62-60, with seven minutes to go. However, Michigan State would nail threes on three of its next five possessions to take an eight-point lead. Harvard was never closer than four the rest of the way.
“I can’t say enough about our team and the effort [that] the guys...showed in the second half to make a run, to take the lead,” Amaker said after the game. “We have had an amazing season.… I’m proud of our program, proud of our team.”

The Harvard rugby team may have been a freshly-minted varsity squad in the 2013-2014 season, but at its core was a slate of seniors who carried on the spirit of the former Radcliffe rugby club squad.
“The fact that we have nine graduating seniors, most of whom played for all four years, shows how significant this graduating class is [to the team], both in numbers and in what I hope we left,” co-captain Brandy Machado said.
Among those senior standouts was co-captain Xanni Brown, who spearheaded the Crimson’s offensive charge as the team’s leading scorer.
Brown anchored the Crimson’s core at fly-half, a taxing position that leads both the offensive and defensive efforts. In one notable display of dominance, the senior made her presence known in the Crimson’s October contest at Brown, scoring 37 points in a 57-7 rout, Harvard’s first victory against the Bears in over a decade.
However, the co-captain, who played on the USA Rugby national team following a standout freshman campaign, saw her senior season come to an end during the Crimson’s spring match against No. 1 Penn State. A broken foot and the ensuing surgery sidelined the senior for the final two games of Harvard’s campaign at the 2014 USA Rugby National Championships.
“The injury came at a pretty disappointing time, so I didn’t necessarily get to the big games this spring,” Brown said. “But I was very grateful that I got to be there to cheer folks on from the sidelines and stay involved in the final stretch.”
It was a tough blow for the senior and for the rest of the Crimson squad, which struggled to fill the hole in its lineup with the absence of its top scorer.
And while her force on the field will no doubt be missed, Brown along with her classmates have left a strong foundation that the young squad can build upon in future years.
“For me, having come into rugby when I did many years ago, when we were scraping it together, it was very exciting for me to finish my senior year with the program looking like it does right now,” Brown said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One step comes after the other. Steve Moundou-Missi knows that. He’s been doing it, and thinking about it too. Another step. This one comes down the sideline in Spokane, Wash. Moundou-Missi is sparking a rally in the Harvard men’s basketball team’s biggest game ever—how else but step by step?
Steps, those are what brought Moundou-Missi to America from his home country of Cameroon. Finding a prep school, convincing his skeptical parents, filing for a visa, step after step. Lifting his first weight, becoming fluent in English, fitting in at Montverde Academy. Some steps were painful, others arduous.
Moundou-Missi reminded himself of where the steps could take him; thinking about the rewards helped motivate him. Thinking, he does a lot of that, too.
More steps. Moundou-Missi rarely dribbles, but there he is, racing up the court. Then, there are no more steps.
No, now he is leaping.
Gone are the thoughtful strides, the contemplation of what to do next. Moundou-Missi says he has always preferred to sit back and observe, to figure out where things are going. Now, he is going—leaping for a thunderous dunk that will bring the Crimson to within four against Michigan State, 55-51, in the third round of the NCAA Tournament. It’s a huge moment for Moundou-Missi, for the team, for the school.
But really, it’s just another step.
Moundou-Missi is a thinker. He always has been. Harvard coach Tommy Amaker could tell the forward was a little different as a recruit, when Moundou-Missi’s logic-driven approach made it hard for the coach to get a read on the high schooler’s preferences, even if Moundou-Missi tried to explain them.
If you are confident Harvard is the right place for me, Moundou-Missi told Amaker, then you should also be confident that I will end up playing for you because I’m going to make the logical choice.
Moundou-Missi’s future teammates caught on quickly, too. It was on his official visit that Moundou-Missi explained he would rather observe Harvard and its students than go out and explore.
He preferred to take it in, not jump in it.
“My teammates were like, ‘Who is this dude? He is kind of weird,’” Moundou-Missi remembered.
It did not take long for recently hired assistant coach Adam Cohen to notice the quirk either. Within weeks, he was begging the forward to “Just play,” telling him “You think too much.”
That’s exactly what Moundou-Missi has been thinking.
“I think too much,” Moundou-Missi said. “That’s the problem.”
The idea came to him last summer when he was playing with the Cameroonian national team.
He noticed the older players enjoying everything about the demanding practices, even the suicides.
Before, Moundou-Missi got through lifting sessions and late-night problem sets by thinking about how it would help him win an Ivy League title or pass a final. Now, he is just trying to enjoy the process.
His national team teammates taught him to live in the moment, and Moundou-Missi has had some good ones to live in since.
The junior scored 23 points against Bryant back in November and had 20 against Denver a week later. Sophomore Moundou-Missi never scored 20 points in a game. But Moundou-Missi says his best game came at Columbia on Valentine’s Day, a 22-point outburst that he credited to a lack of thought.
“Early in the game, I was struggling —and then I found a rhythm,” Moundou-Missi said. “It was one of the few games where I felt like I couldn’t miss.”
Moundou-Missi made his greatest strides this year at the free-throw line, where he exchanged contemplation of what might happen if he missed for confidence. That helped him go from a 70-percent shooter to 76-percent shooter, second on the team to co-captain Laurent Rivard.
When Moundou-Missi returns to Cameroon, even relatives strugge to recognize him as the 180-pound boy that left for America years ago. People think he’s joking when he says he goes to Harvard. Telling them that the quiet kid they knew is now the face of Crimson basketball probably does not help convince anyone.
After the 2013-2014 season ended, Moundou-Missi was voted a captain by his teammates.
He said it’s an honor, especially given how he struggled to fit in with his team in high school and even when he started at Harvard.
But, he added, taking more responsibility in the locker room as a senior—it’s really just another step.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 2013-2014 Harvard men’s basketball season posed a relatively new challenge for coach Tommy Amaker, but it was a challenge that any head coach would have welcomed without a second thought. Perhaps unlike any other season he’d had at the helm of the Crimson, Amaker had more talent than he knew what to do with. Anything but a fourth consecutive Ivy championship would be viewed as a waste of the talent he had accumulated in Cambridge.
But managing expectations is a skill in coaching just like any other, and Amaker did that expertly, calmly guiding his team to a program-best 13-1 conference record and another bid to the NCAA Tournament.
This season, Amaker saved his best coaching moment for last. In its first game of the NCAA Tournament, Harvard narrowly edged No. 5-seeded Cincinnati, 61-57, and then faced a showdown with preseason No. 2 Michigan State in Spokane, Wash.
Against the Spartans, Amaker was going up against one of his coaching nemeses from his previous stint coaching at the University of Michigan, Tom Izzo.
Amaker and Izzo, who first met while recruiting Chris Webber more than twenty years earlier, had coached against each other multiple times in the early 2000s.
Izzo came out on top almost every time since the rivals met for the first time in 2002.
In the opening half, Amaker and the Crimson looked as if they might be swept away by the athletic, aggressive Spartans, taking a double-digit deficit into the locker room as Michigan State forward Branden Dawson put up 20 points on an array of fastbreak dunks and layups.
But after the break, it appeared Amaker had outfoxed Izzo.
Trotting out a small lineup against the bigger Spartans allowed the Harvard guards to finally find both some space in the lane and their open shooters, whose three-pointers fell much more readily than they had in the first period. Harvard made four threes in the second half after just two in the first.
The Crimson stormed back into the game, even briefly taking a two-point lead on co-captain Laurent Rivard’s three with seven minutes to go, and winning over the Spokane crowd in the process.
But in the end, the boost Amaker had given his team could not overcome the Spartans’ edge in talent, and the Crimson fell, 80-73, under a barrage of threes from the Spartan wings.
“I thought that group in particular really gave us the effort that we needed,” said Amaker after the game about the smaller lineup. “We spaced the floor a lot better being smaller…. [W]e wanted to stay with that group.  That group was the group that obviously got us back into it and made the run, and we were hoping that that group [was] going to be able to bring it home for us.”
With all this season’s accomplishments, Amaker appears to have completed the five-step process he outlined upon taking the Harvard job: upstart, contender, winner, champion, and, finally, dynasty.
The Crimson is the first Ivy team to win four straight titles in two decades as well as the first to win 20 games in five consecutive seasons since the 1970s. The team had never won an Ancient Eight championship before Amaker arrived; now it has taken home the last four.
And with Harvard returning a bevy of talent next season, there is no indication that he (or the team) will be slowing down anytime soon.
“Tommy is a great leader, a great coach and a great educator,” wrote Athletic Director Robert L. Scalise in a statement after Amaker announced that he would return to Harvard next season. “He is an inspiration to many in the Harvard community.”

When co-captain Brandon McLaughlin stepped onto the exhibition squash court at the CSA Team Championships, the Harvard men’s squash team only needed one more match to claim the national title.
 
“If we had won that team event 8-1 and if [McLaughlin] was the one who lost, I think that to his dying day he would never forget that, and the victory would have never felt the same,” coach Mike Way said. “I had every confidence that we were going to win another match to win the national title. My only concern was for Brandon. He had his mom and dad in the crowd, people were going wild, and I only wanted it for him.”
 
After wins by freshmen Dylan Murray and Bryan Koh, junior Tyler Olson, and senior Nigel Koh put Harvard up by four against Trinity, the crowd gathered in the stands to watch McLaughlin play his last collegiate team match.
 
“It was the pinnacle of my career,” McLaughlin said. “Especially since I probably won’t play competitively ever again. I’ve been training for a pretty long time to get to this point, and it was a great way to finish. The whole season was built towards this match. Squash is a very individual sport, but the whole team was working towards [winning nationals], and it’s great that we all showed up on that day and performed really well.
 
In the 2013 team championships, McLaughlin had gone up against the Bantams’ Juan Vargas, but came up short with a 1-3 loss. So this year, after Trinity’s Karan Malik came back to take the lead, 2-1, Way was worried that last season’s result would repeat itself.
 
“Last year, he was killing his opponent and something happened in his head,” Way said. “He had the guy, he was in total control, and something happened. I think that he was in the driver’s seat on and off in this match, but there was a period in the fifth game where he really had to catch himself, and he did.”
 
McLaughlin managed to compose himself to win the fourth and set up a deciding fifth game.
“What he needed to do in the fifth game was pretty straightforward,” Way said. “But he had dug himself an enormous hole at the start and had to change things. With him, as well as others, it’s about sticking to the plan. He sometimes gets away from the game plan and wants to finish the rallies too soon, which is when unforced errors creep in.”
In the fifth game, Malik fought back to a tie it at 10-all. At game point, the crowd was completely silent as the rally started. However, once McLaughlin delivered a drop shot that Malik was unable to return, a deafening cheer rose as the senior turned around and fist pumped to the audience.
 
“I just had so much adrenaline going,” McLaughlin said. “I had played [Malik] before so I had a game plan for how I wanted to play with him. He’s a pretty talented player, so I wanted to keep him in the back as much as I could. But in a match like that, it’s much more about emotion. We’re both pretty good squash players, so it was whoever wanted it more.”
 
The senior’s last home match gave him a final mark of 13-2.
 
“Brandon has carried the team as the captain and leader by example, not just by words,” classmate Ali Farag said. “He’s led the team by his work ethic and maturity, and no one could have [earned that] victory as he did. Being down, 2-1, and coming back is just incredible. I think that what he did is something he will remember for his entire life.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard basketball fans have gotten very accustomed to the phrase “Three-pointer.  Laurent Rivard” in Lavietes Pavilion over the past four years. But how could they not? Laurent hit quite a few of them in his time at Harvard. There were 287 to be exact, which is the most threes in Harvard history and the second-most in Ivy League history. Laurent was so deadly from deep that teammates and fans often began the three-point celebration as soon as the ball left his hand. No need to wait and see; the result was imminent. But while these deep threes might be the first thing that comes to mind for fans when looking back on the career of Laurent Rivard, his most significant contributions to Harvard basketball were made behind the scenes, far removed from the announcers and screaming fans.
Laurent arrived in Cambridge as a freshman ready to contribute. In his first season, he played over 25 minutes and averaged 11 points per game. Even as a newcomer, Laurent stepped up in the big games throughout the year. Most notably, he scored a career-high 23 points in a big win for Harvard at Boston College. He was awarded Ivy League Rookie of the Week three times and finished third among rookies in scoring. These trends continued throughout his four years at Harvard as Laurent finished his career ranked 11th in scoring in Harvard history with 1,270 points. Laurent also received an All-Ivy League honorable mention his junior year and was second team All-Ivy League his senior season.
During his four years at Harvard, Laurent developed significantly as a player, teammate, and leader. As a senior, Laurent had added dimensions to his game that every team needs in order to be successful at the highest level. While displaying the same three-point stroke he was known for, he became an excellent help-side defender, providing the support and rotation necessary to keep opponents from getting good looks at the basket. Despite being a more traditional wing player, Laurent embraced his role guarding opponents’ big men in order to create a matchup nightmare defensively for other teams when their bigs were expected to guard him.
Similarly, he was never afraid to lay his body on the line and take a charge against opponents driving to the hoop. If teams tried to spotlight him and keep him from getting open on the perimeter, Laurent kept the ball moving, and became a great screener to generate even better scoring opportunities for teammates. These aspects of basketball are not as glamorous or awe-inducing as a clutch three, but all have been staples of the Harvard basketball identity and crucial to the success of this program.
As an underclassman, Laurent was able to lead by example and let his work ethic, dedication, and on-court performances do the talking. However, as his time at Harvard progressed, so too did his leadership. With each year came a better understanding of what it takes to be successful as well as the confidence to relay this understanding to the rest of the team. As a co-captain his junior and senior seasons, his criticisms came without a personal agenda, with only the success of the team as a whole in mind. Laurent was always his own biggest critic and most suggestions he brought to the team were changes for “us,” not changes for “you.” These things are not easy to say, but, again, were necessary for the success of Harvard basketball.
Despite these developments, there were some things that remained a constant for Laurent during his time as a Harvard basketball player. The first is his tireless work ethic and dedication. It never mattered if Laurent were in a drought or riding a hot streak for his shooting; he was always in the gym. Whether getting up thousands of shots on the shooting machine or working with coaches on other aspects of his game, Laurent was always improving and striving for perfection. It’s easy to have an opinion that matters in a locker room when you sacrifice and put the individual work in for your team.
The second constant during Laurent’s four years here at Harvard is winning. Four years, four Ivy League championships, three NCAA Tournament appearances, and two NCAA Tournament wins. These accomplishments speak for themselves and are even more impressive considering that Harvard had never won an Ivy League title when Laurent’s freshman class stepped on campus.
This is not to say that Laurent is the biggest factor in these Harvard basketball achievements—and he would be the first to make sure everyone knows that. It is this hard work, dedication, and team-first attitude that will be missed by his teammates, coaches, and the Harvard community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Fédération Internationale de Football Association. That sounds French, you say; you don’t trust it. Well, fine, but we haven’t even opened the box yet. What if I just gave you the acronym? FIFA. FEE-fah. Yeah, I know you dig that alliteration.
I didn’t much follow soccer before playing EA’s FIFA series, and I didn’t particularly care to. Largely because of the deficit of hand-eye coordination native to the Frenchman, the sport did not involve the use of one’s hands, as all red-blooded sports must, and so I dismissed it as a curiosity.
But along came college and all sorts of curiosities to which I could expose myself, one of which came on an Xbox in a Matthews Hall dorm room. And as I reflect on the last four years, I realize now that my greatest competitive battles at Harvard have come not at the MAC or in an Ec 10 lecture hall, but with my rear planted firmly on some species of futon and my hands wrapped around a small video remote.
Once I began to get the hang of it, FIFA quickly became a staple of my idle leisure time. It served as the pregame, the postgame, and sometimes, if one chose to introduce the proper dosage of malt liquor into the equation, the centerpiece of the night itself. Shuttle in 20 minutes? Let’s get a quick game in. Paper due at midnight? Let’s get in a 30-minute FIFA break.
The release of each successive iteration of the game every year was followed by the same series of emotions: relentless anticipation in the weeks leading up to the first preorder date, unbridled joy when the game first arrived; frustration when trying to master the new tweaks in the gameplay (“they RUINED it this time!”), and, within a few days, the sense of growing satisfaction that, as one continued to invest the necessary hours, mastery of the craft would once again return.
The most intense FIFA experience on campus could be found in Currier House, where 12 individuals, using customized teams selected in a 15-round fantasy draft, played a full round-robin season against one another. As with any other fast-paced, highly demanding competitive environment, those that could not measure up were ritualistically shamed into improving their skills or dropping out altogether.
A loss by a score of 5-0 or worse mandated a Facebook post from the loser to the winner—a public apology for the waste of the victor’s precious time. A 10-0 loss required a handwritten letter to the victor’s parents expressing more fervently the loser’s remorse in putting forth such a dismal challenge. I have only ever seen one handwritten letter; the author hasn’t picked up a controller since.
I can still remember the most beautiful goal I’ve ever seen live. It was a game of two-on-two, a format that typically doesn’t lend itself to beautiful goals, as one’s moments of inspiration must blend with the whims of an often unpredictable partner.
My teammate beat his defender down the left flank and dribbled the ball toward the net along the end line. Crossing the ball into the box was the only viable option—not pretty, but workmanlike.
Then, from the sharpest of angles, he released a point blank chip shot that crested over the keeper, heading toward the back post.
For a moment, the game’s gravitational engine seemed to malfunction. How could it be possible for an object to float so gently, so slowly that all 22 players on the pitch paused, transfixed by its arc?
Or, more accurately, 21 players. Just before it crossed the goal line and was cushioned by the side netting, the ball met the path of my player, charging blindly up the field on a forty-yard sprint. With the gentlest of thuds, it glanced off my chest and into the wide open goal.
My player stopped for a moment after his momentum carried him into the back of the net, a newly scored goal at his feet. He looked suddenly woken from a trance, unable to explain his behavior, unsure what share of the credit to claim. Hesitantly, he glanced over at his teammate. A knowing smile; all was well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
On March 10, 2007, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team played over 127 minutes in a quadruple-overtime heartbreaker loss to Wisconsin that sent the Badgers to the Frozen Four. The game was the longest in program history and, at the time, the second-longest ever in women’s college hockey.
Nearly seven years later, the Crimson played its next contest that stretched into multiple overtime periods. Looking for a spot in the next round of the ECAC playoffs, the Crimson took to the ice against Yale for 241 minutes of game time that spanned three contests from Feb. 28 to March 2.
No drama was spared, as a Friday night double-overtime loss to the Bulldogs was followed by another double-overtime game—this time a Harvard win—and a decisive Sunday afternoon showdown that sent the Crimson off to face Cornell in the conference semifinals.
 “It’s kind of a track meet out there,” said interim Harvard coach Maura Crowell at the time. “Both sides are getting their chances, goalies are coming up big, and it’s a rollercoaster.”
Statistics from the series, like the almost 13 periods of hockey played or the 131 saves made by Yale goalie Jaimie Leonoff, tell a story of superlatives, but the real story lies in the four hours of tense, stalemate hockey punctuated by last-minute key plays.
Crimson rookie goalie Brianna Laing took to the ice for the two most important starts of her career during the Saturday and Sunday contests, fending off any momentum the Bulldogs carried in from their 3-2 Friday win.
Calm under fire, Laing made many clutch saves down the stretch on Saturday, while sophomore Miye D’Oench found openings past Yale’s blueline and Leonoff to tie and win the game, 3-2.
“I think it needed to happen,” said D’Oench after her game-winner, which went under official review. “Something needed to go our way. It was a lucky bounce, and we haven’t been getting a lot of those.”
Sunday saw the Crimson blank the Bulldogs, 4-0. Harvard capitalized on tired Eli legs, and a flurry of Crimson players were able to send the puck past the crease for the win and the berth in the next round.
While Harvard was unable to upend the Big Red for a place in the finals, the team played some of its best hockey of the year throughout the Yale series, displaying endurance and perseverance in the face of two contests that seemed to have no end.

Thanks to his ability to empathize with the players and his talent for recruiting, coach Chris Wojcik ’96 led the Harvard lacrosse program to new heights in the 2014 season. 
 
“The past three years that I have been with [Wojcik], he has continued to progress as a coach like our team has progressed as a unit,” junior goaltender Jake Gambitsky said. “He works really hard to be in tune with everything that goes on in our lives, academically, socially, and on the lacrosse field.”
 
Wojcik, who captained both the Harvard varsity lacrosse and soccer teams as an undergraduate, is in tune with the needs of his players when it comes to balancing academic demands and athletic ones.
 
“I’ve been in the players’ shoes as a student-athlete at Harvard,” Wojcik said. “I know the demands that they are under…. I know they first have to take care of business with their academics and then second be able to be a Division I athlete…. I can then devise our overall program around that.”
 
Success as a head coach was not immediate for Wojcik, as the 2014 season was the first time since his start with the Crimson squad in 2011 that the team has had a winning record in both overall games and Ancient Eight play.
 
Harvard also captured its first Ivy League regular season title in 24 years this year, and advanced to NCAA tournament play for the first time since 2006.
Wojcik’s recruiting capability has played a major factor in the team’s success.
 
“The success that we had this year was a result of the talented players that we had,” Wojcik said. “Bringing in talented players is obviously very important to any program. We have been able to successfully recruit some strong classes, and I think you can see that on the field.”
 
Harvard has boasted a top-10 recruiting class every year since Wojcik started with the Crimson. It is his hope that, with a strong lineup, the Harvard men’s lacrosse program will see even greater success in the future.
 
“I think our goals are always simply to be the best that we can be,” Wojcik said. “Tangibly our goals are to win the Ivy League regular season championship, win the Ivy League tournament, and then win the national championship. I hope that our NCAA tournament appearance this year will inspire our players to be even hungrier next year.”

When Harvard’s public face is most needed to sell the University to donors in London, Rio de Janeiro, or Hong Kong, being buried in papers and committee work in Massachusetts Hall does not do much good. To inspire donors and seed their stake in Harvard’s expensive list of capital campaign priorities, University President Drew G. Faust takes to the road.
With a capital campaign to run and dollars to raise, Faust has been spending an increased amount of her time traveling, headlining alumni events, and speaking with donors. In the last few years, Faust’s travel itinerary has spanned not just the United States, but at least four continents, as she visited cities ranging from New York to Seoul and Mumbai. Faust says that she now spends up to 50 percent of her time on campaign-related efforts, travel among them.
“It’s a year that has been defined in many ways by the campaign and by the various events University-wide and at the individual schools relating to the campaign, so that’s been a standing part of my life since the launch in September,” Faust says.
She is not alone. As Harvard embarks on an ambitious, $6.5 billion fundraising drive, leaders across Harvard’s schools have adjusted their schedules, exchanging time in their Cambridge or Boston offices for airports and hours on the road. Eight months into the Harvard Campaign’s five-year public phase, regular events across the world attract large audiences of alumni and other potential donors, along with high-profile Harvard administrators who deliver remarks urging audiences to give.
University officials see traveling for the campaign as a means to solicit donations outside of Cambridge, but  it also offers them a chance to school alumni around the globe in the University’s priorities. And as they increasingly leave their desks for the road, top administrators take their work—and their cell phones—with them, stretching their schedules and prompting some to question whether the University’s leaders should more highly prioritize their day-to-day roles on campus.
DIVIDING THEIR TIME
Along with Faust, Harvard’s other central administrators in particular focus much of their attention on the University-wide drive—and its priorities—they are tasked with spearheading. Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 says he spends 30 to 50 percent of his time on campaign-related activities, even if he spends “much less time” traveling than Faust.
Deans of the University’s various schools likewise devote time on the job to fundraising and making pitches to donors. Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith says he spends half his time campaigning for FAS, the school whose $2.5 billion goal indicates that it will benefit most from The Harvard Campaign, which altogether is poised to set the international record for drives among institutions of higher education.
Dean of Harvard Business School Nitin Nohria writes in an email that the campaign “has certainly required my attention and focus.” Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood '75 similarly says he is spending an increased amount of time on the road and meeting with donors, though he did not specify a percentage.
These efforts take up not only a great deal of time, but also require far-reaching travel. Faust has flown across the country—to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., among other cities—and across the globe to promote the University and its campaign priorities to alumni and potential donors.
She spoke in Davos, Switzerland, and London in January, and at a “Your Harvard: New York City” event in mid-May, where she addressed Harvard affiliates on a decommissioned aircraft carrier on the Hudson River.
Even day-to-day events that involve interacting with students or alumni seemingly independent of the campaign can become campaign-related if donors are in attendance. Varsity basketball games, for which alumni fans—some of them prominent donors—regularly descend on Cambridge, are a recent example.
“There’s a certain overlap and confusion between activities that are student-facing, dean-facing, management-facing, and at the same time alumni-facing,” Faust says. “Some [activities] fit into multiple categories.”
Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Cherry A. Murray also says she multi-tasks; she often speaks with alumni on trips she takes to Washington for the several advisory boards she sits on external to her responsibilities at Harvard.
Of course, administrators’ heavy focus on fundraising is not new to this capital campaign’s public phase—even in non-campaign years, administrators including the University president and FAS dean devote significant amounts of time to speaking with alumni and donors.
Former FAS Dean William C. Kirby, whose time in University Hall in the mid-2000s did not coincide with a capital campaign, says he still spent a “significant amount” of time fundraising and engaging with alumni throughout his tenure, taking a number of trips to New York and “all across the country and to Asia and Europe.”
RALLYING THE TROOPS
Whenever University leaders take to the road, they have a chance to fundraise. But perhaps just as importantly, administrators seek to inspire a heightened sense of excitement at campaign events and use it as an opportunity to educate alumni worldwide on the priorities that Harvard has chosen to fund with its campaign. While this may not consist of directly soliciting, administrators say that it serves an important role in building social capital, which they hope will translate to physical donations.
Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Tamara E. Rogers ’74 says that Faust, in particular, is in a position to attract alumni to events.
“The President is always a big draw,” Rogers says. “Many alumni don’t have the opportunity to hear her speak. By her going around the country, it’s a great chance for people to finally have a chance to see her and hear her and then perhaps meet her at the reception afterwards.”
Garber, who serves in a similar role when he travels, agrees that Faust is the campaign’s prime messenger.


“President Faust is very much the public face of the campaign, and she tells the story like nobody else can,” Garber says.
Former University President Neil L. Rudenstine, who traveled extensively when he led what is considered Harvard’s last capital campaign in the 1990s, suggests that the president’s most significant role is articulating the University’s priorities to the larger alumni community, rather than asking for money.
“That's the most important thing a President can bring,” Rudenstine says. “If you have a significant, very large campaign, as we did—at least measured by the ’90s standards—people want to hear from the President why it's so important. It's much more important than actually asking people directly for the money.”
When he traveled for his campaign, Rudenstine says he spent probably no more than half his time speaking with donors.
“I found on the whole that my asking people [for gifts] was very, very limited, and I much preferred to talk to people about what the needs were,” he says.
Kirby, for his part, says fundraising and engaging with alumni enables administrators to hear outside perspectives on Harvard.
“It’s very important to get out and talk with others,” he says. “It’s a central part of the job, irrespective of a campaign.”
OUT OF OFFICE
With increasing travel commitments and fundraising responsibilities, the campaign adds to schedules already stretched thin by running a major research university. According to Kirby, when going on a fundraising trip necessitates traveling to a significantly different time zone and then returning to campus, “you’re basically up most of the night."
“You are simply busier, without question, if you’re on the West Coast or you’re in Europe or you’re in East Asia, than you’d otherwise be,” Kirby says, adding that administrators are “totally plugged in” to the goings on in Cambridge while they are off campus.
Faust maintains that she still runs the University when she is on the road for the campaign—she says just using her cell phone allows her to keep in touch with her responsibilities on campus.
“The fact is, the deans and Drew [Faust] and I—we all are pretty much available 24/7,” Garber says.
Other administrators, like Nohria, similarly suggest that they are able to keep up with day-to-day roles in Cambridge despite increased focus on the campaign. Murray says she can delegate work on campus to two executive deans.
Still, some faculty members question the effectiveness of leadership whose topmost executives devote as much, if not more, time to fundraising than to addressing faculty concerns. Ali S. Asani ’77, a professor in the Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations Department, says that it is difficult for faculty members to meet with Smith, and suggested that “the campaign definitely affects” the dean’s level of engagement with the academics in the departments he oversees.
“There are so many demands on [the FAS Dean’s] Office—you’re an administrator, you’re in the campaign, you’re doing this—that he has no time for faculty,” Asani says.
An FAS spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on the claim that Smith has become inaccessible to faculty members.
Richard M. Losick, the interim chair of the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, says that he remembers “an era when the senior leadership was much more engaged with the faculty and students than is the case today.” He says that while a lack of connection across the University hierarchy may or may not be a direct result of campaigning, it is commonly used as an explanation for it.
“I didn’t notice an abrupt change that I could attribute to the campaign, but I’ve heard this brought as an excuse,” Losick adds.
Even administrators who insist that they are fully engaged with their on-campus responsibilities while fundraising acknowledge the added demands of a campaign.
Although at “crucial moments” it could take up to two-thirds of his efforts, Rudenstine says that he set a personal rule not to spend more than 30 or 40 percent of his time on his campaign, as an average, when he was president.
“There were just too many other academic and other things to attend to that had obvious, very high priority, and while the campaign was an immense priority as well, one just had to ration what one did,” Rudenstine says. Still, he says that traveling on the road was “tremendously important” in his own experience.
"It might seem to some people to take the President or other people away from the University, which in one sense it obviously does, for a reasonable amount of time,” Rudenstine says. “At the same time...there's no way to communicate what the University means and what it’s doing and what it can achieve without actually having group sessions, without meeting with individuals, without having large alumni gatherings where you can give talks, and so on.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Innovation is the watchword for Harvard as it begins to unveil and bring to life its vision for education at a time when the classroom, the centuries-old center of learning, is in upheaval.
An ongoing capital campaign—launched this fall and set to break global fundraising records—offers Harvard’s flagship school the opportunity to modernize its approach to one of its core missions of teaching and learning amid the rise of virtual education and challenges to conventional classroom practices.
With an emphasis on innovation and technology, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, home of Harvard College, is funneling $150 million toward a priority titled “Leading in Learning.” If brought to fruition, the school’s vision could transform not only the way members of the Harvard community teach and learn, but also the physical spaces they inhabit.
But while campaign showrunners have shared their plans to inject funds into three key areas—the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, Harvard’s branch of the online learning platform edX, and the expansion of classroom infrastructure—much about the direction of their vision remains unclear.
Seeking to learn about learning, and ultimately, lead in the increasingly crowded and progressive landscape of higher education, Harvard is planning its vision of the liberal arts in the 21st century. Yet some faculty members question what “innovation” really means, where it will lead FAS, and to what extent these changes will enhance education at a centuries-old institution.
DISRUPTION IN LEARNING
To take center stage in the rapidly evolving field of higher education, Harvard has zeroed in on technology and innovation as a means of diversifying models of learning while carrying on its liberal arts tradition.


The “Leading in Learning” priority represents 6 percent of the FAS’s total $2.5 billion campaign goal. While the school’s other priorities will bolster and expand existing faculty programs, financial aid, and renewal of the undergraduate houses, the “Leading in Learning” initiative, as reflected in its title, is one of Harvard’s most direct attempts to respond to new challenges to its traditional model of education.
“At this moment of disruption and change, Harvard will shape the future of education,” reads a 30-page booklet distributed at the campaign’s launch last October mapping out the school’s vision for the initiative.
With the increasing presence of education-oriented digital technology in the form of online classes, virtual learning applications, and data analysis methods, Harvard is presented with many opportunities to transform education.
At the same time, while many consider other top-rated schools—namely Stanford and other members of the Ivy League—the main challengers to Harvard’s position as the world’s foremost academic institution, it is smaller liberal arts colleges that are pushing the boundaries of teaching and learning, FAS administrators and faculty members say.
“It is true that our challenge is to compete not only with the Stanfords and Yales and Princetons as research universities,” says History  and Business School professor and former FAS Dean William C. Kirby. “But also, we hope, to offer students the kind of education that you can also get at Williams, and Amherst, at Carleton and at Oberlin.”
Kirby says he believes students at these colleges are inspired with a sense of excitement about academics that leads more of them, proportionately, to go on to graduate education at the doctoral level than their counterparts at large research universities.
Robert A. Lue, professor of the practice of molecular and cellular biology professor and faculty director of both HarvardX and the Bok Center, says that to meet this two-pronged challenge, Harvard must focus on supporting the development of teaching and learning techniques as well as strengthening faculty research endeavors.
“What we increasingly realize is that in the same way you can push the envelope in your scholarship, the faculty and colleagues realize you can push the envelope in teaching and learning,” Lue says. 
 
But with competition from these more intimate and undergraduate-oriented institutions, says longtime Sociology professor Howard E. Gardner ’65, Harvard has a chance to look to others for ideas rather than being forced to conceive of solutions from scratch.
“We shouldn’t be too narcissistic and just look at ourselves in the mirror,” Gardner says.
The “Leading in Learning” priority includes investments in programs that foster faculty innovation and the communication of best practices, along with the creation of infrastructure to allow faculty to experiment and teach in novel ways.
FAS Dean Michael D. Smith emphasizes the school’s focus on building and expanding models of learning. These changes, he says, are necessary in part because of the modern skillsets and practices of the students who now populate Harvard’s largest school.
“Ten years from now, I think you’ll see many different kinds of teaching styles [and] learning environments,” Smith says. “You’ll see changes in our physical environment to help support that.”
EXPERIMENTING IN LEARNING
Driven by this mission to learn about learning, the early stages of the campaign have been defined by experimentation and expansion, a trend that worries those seeking articulation of what this change is meant to achieve.
Two of the most prominent initiatives, the two-year-old HarvardX and the Bok Center, are testing out different types of teaching methods and gathering information about how students best learn.
In some courses that are adapted for HarvardX, like Peter L. Galison’s “The Einstein Revolution,” faculty members screen lectures prior to class time, during which students engage with and discuss the material rather than listen to the professor speak. This, often referred to as the “flipped classroom” method, is designed to optimize the time that students spend with their professors in class.
Molecular and Cellular Biology professor Richard M. Losick says that using the flipped classroom model allows students to use class time for what is often referred to as “active learning.”
“There is material you can learn on your own and [you can use] the classroom for delving more deeply into concepts and for discussion about these concepts,” Losick says.
Similarly, the Bok Center encourages Harvard’s teaching staff to adopt new instructional methods and to move away from the traditional practice of what Losick calls the “sage on the stage.”
In March, The Crimson reported that the Bok Center will more than double the size of its 15-person staff and open a number of satellite offices across campus. Campaign literature has stated that funding for the Bok Center will be channeled toward improving “media literacy” among faculty and graduate students, developing the speaking and student engagement skills of College students, and generating and spreading best practices for teaching and learning.
While HarvardX and the Bok Center, the portions of the “Leading in Learning” initiative aimed at testing and honing ideas for new teaching models, have begun to develop, infrastructural changes are still yet to appear on campus.
However, an unofficial document penned by faculty and administrators at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences offers a glimpse into the vision for the new facilities of the school. The writers of the white paper champion variety and dynamism in physical spaces, calling for “curvilinear designs,” “transparent walls,” and “sunlit” spaces that blur the lines between spaces for teaching, research, and socializing.
In addition, FAS officials also plan to use “Leading in Learning” funds to expand the SEAS incubator and finance less clearly defined capital elements like new classrooms and teaching styles.
While FAS campaign literature broadly outlines goals to improve teaching and learning, however, the specific procedures necessary to improve teaching and learning are still unclear to some faculty members, Philosophy professor and chair of the Committee on General Education Edward J. Hall says.
“I do not have the sense that the faculty as a whole feels like, ‘oh, there’s this initiative that we are all implicitly a part of,’” he says. “Whatever the initiative is, it hasn’t been broadcast to the faculty in the way that’s going to have that type of impact.”
According to Hall, the campaign widely broadcasts its emphasis on lofty themes to donors through speeches and literature, but the faculty have yet to hear a cohesive message about how professors and students should interact with each other in and outside of the classroom due to new technology and practices.
“‘Innovation’ carries a clear connotation of change for the better, change in some exciting new direction that’s going to lead us to do something we were doing before in a new and much improved way,” Hall says, referring to terms he has often hear in tandem with the campaign's goals. “If you’re being honest you need to show that what you are doing in the classroom is not merely different than what you had done before, but [that] it's really much more effective in targeting the goals of your class.”
Classics professor Richard F. Thomas agrees, saying that the campaign literature has been less specific than that of the previous campaign on goals related to teaching and learning.
“I think a lot of the language is very vague, abstract, and not very useful in many ways,” he says. “There’s a certain vagueness which can probably be attributed to the fact that a lot of the people don’t know where the technology is going and in what ways that technology will be applied to teaching and learning.”
QUESTIONS IN LEARNING
The campaign literature’s emphasis on the importance of new technologies and innovative learning environments raises concerns beyond the issue of clarity for some. While funds can ensure that touchscreens, mobile whiteboards, and egg-shaped tables find their ways into unconventional classrooms and that lectures are recorded and broadcasted for the entire world to view, some caution that the capital campaign’s touted “innovation” might not be effective and, in some cases, could even negatively impact Harvard education.
Although showrunners envision new classrooms that allow for a broader range of teaching methods, some say that the efficacy of these methods depends on whether Harvard’s teaching staff is prepared to utilize these new spaces and techniques.
“Faculty are the content experts in the material they know and are imparting to students,” Education School Professor Joseph P. Zolner says. “They are not focused on the best ways to impart that knowledge through new forms of media, through new technologies.”
Given their relative lack of awareness of new pedagogical techniques, Zolner says, it is important that faculty members seek out the resources of the Bok Center, which provides training and professional development resources to Harvard teaching staff.
However, Kirby says, senior faculty members across the country rarely go to the teaching centers like the Bok Center for remedial work, though those who teach HarvardX courses have recently utilized the Center’s resources.
Despite increased use of the Bok Center by these senior faculty members, some still question how large the dividends of HarvardX—another of the campaign’s priorities—will be.
Criticizing the administration’s prioritization of HarvardX both inside and out of the capital campaign’s context, a number of faculty members have raised concerns about the special attention the online education platform has recently received.
In May 2013, 58 faculty members wrote a letter to FAS Dean Michael D. Smith, urging him to convene a faculty committee to oversee FAS’s involvement with HarvardX and to help determine if the platform aligns with the school’s educational goals.
“It is our responsibility to ensure that HarvardX is consistent with our commitment to our students on campus, and with our academic mission,” the signatories wrote.
Hall, one of the letter’s signatories, cautions that HarvardX, while with potential benefits, might distract faculty members away from their on campus students.
“It can easily lead to situations where you as a faculty member can fool yourself into thinking you can do something that really counts as teaching on that kind of scale,” he says.
He and others also warn that by asking undergraduates to rely on HarvardX rather than in-person lectures, students’ educational experience might be impaired.
“Any kind of course that you hope will have some kind of transformative effect on the students, it’s just not going to happen when a student takes a course online,” Hall says, explaining that HarvardX materials must be used in tandem with in-class engagement to have any benefit.
As faculty members continue to explore new methods of teaching and capital campaign money is slated to fund further experimentation, Zolner says that it is important to keep in mind the true role of technology in bringing the Harvard education into the 21st century.
Explaining that while it can greatly benefit pedagogy, Zolner says technology in and of itself is not the improvement. “Technology is an infrastructure. It’s not the solution, it’s the means,” he says. “We need to make sure that the technology tail does not end up wagging the teaching-and-learning dog.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
As the staff of The Crimson is well aware, involvement in extracurricular activities on campus can necessitate a significant commitment of time and effort. Some faculty members have expressed concern over the time and energy students at Harvard are spending outside the classroom; the opportunity cost, they argue, is a more intense, fulfilling, and informative academic experience. The nation was shocked to learn that the median grade at Harvard is an A-, a statistic that many interpret, rightly or wrongly, to mean that Harvard is too easy—that the attention of its students must be focused elsewhere.
While grade inflation is a complex issue, we would not be so quick to discount the role that extracurricular activities can play in shaping young minds—indeed, as the cliché goes, in “teaching students how to think.” For while student groups function largely without faculty oversight, there are things one can learn in a play, during a debate round, or through service in the Phillips Brooks House Association that simply are not teachable in the classroom. 
Whether that learning is about teamwork, leadership, perseverance, or a specific subject area, students in organizations have a unique set of motivations: to win a competition, display a skill, feel a sense of belonging. The members of Harvard’s highly successful Fed Challenge team, for example, work hard in part because they are interested in macroeconomics and monetary policy and in part because they want to remain national champions. In their own ways, organizations like the Anscombe Society, which advocates for abstinence from pre-marital sex and against same-sex marriage, and Munch, a discussion-based group for students interested in BDSM, provide safe and supportive forums for conversations that might otherwise not be had. The passion of individual student groups often spills over into the College community as a whole. The Kuumba Singers of Harvard College, whose music expresses black artistry and spirituality, put on performances that are educational as well as impressive. The incredible success of the men’s basketball team in recent years also highlights how the dedication of a handful of students can excite the entire student body, helping to foster the sense of community that is so important at a liberal arts college.
Given the positive impact student group membership has on the undergraduate experience, the University should play an active role in removing financial barriers to participation. We were disappointed that Undergraduate Council representatives’ call for an additional $250,000 in funding fell on deaf ears. UC President Gus A. Mayopolous ’15 has called the approximately $500,000 UC budget significantly smaller than budgets at other schools. For instance, the student government budget at Georgetown is nearly double the UC’s. Predictably, a gradual stretching of the UC budget, which was last increased eight years ago, has resulted in diminished funding for club sports: The maximum subsidy has fallen from $2,000 to $1,275, and some teams have been forced to raise fees or enact spending cuts. With a $32 billion endowment and a president whose total compensation hit the $1 million mark in 2012, we think the $250,000 request is more than fair. The University is committed to making a Harvard education affordable to all; it should commit to making the full Harvard experience accessible and affordable as well.
Budget constraints have become a problem in part because of the large number of campus student groups, now at 399. And even that number excludes Harvard’s 65 club sports teams and 86 PBHA-affiliated service groups. On the surface, a broad array of extracurricular options is a positive. As Harvard admits an increasingly diverse set of students, it seems only natural that an increasingly diverse set of talents and interests be represented on its extracurricular landscape. But there may be some more pernicious factors at play. If students are compelled to form new, redundant organizations because they feel excluded from those that exist already, then the growth of student groups may reflect a deeper cultural problem at Harvard, one that sometimes takes the form of intense elitism and competition. We are also concerned about pre-professional pressure felt by students, who feel they must be a president or a treasurer in order to land a summer internship or job post-graduation. 
Organizations like Veritas Financial Group, the Harvard College Consulting Group, and Harvard Undergraduate Women in Business have an obvious pre-professional slant. Student publications provide a journalistic experience impossible to replicate in the classroom. Clubs like the Entrepreneurship Forum and Hack Harvard teach valuable entrepreneurial and technical skills.
But just because a skill cannot be taught in a lab or lecture does not mean it is not worth learning. We hope the undergraduates who participate in pre-professional clubs are gaining real expertise. Even managing the finances or travel schedule of a club with no connection to a particular professional field can teach skills that may be very useful in one’s eventual career. Of course, membership in certain organizations may serve simply as a signal of interest to employers. If a student who would prefer to play Quidditch or compete at a poetry slam foregoes a passion in order to add a more vocationally minded line to a resume, then that is a shame. 
And so we offer guarded support for efforts to fund and sustain the diverse slate of student groups at Harvard. We believe firmly in the importance of keeping a robust set of extracurricular activities accessible to all members of Harvard’s community. As such, we condemn the administration for refusing to grant the UC’s request for additional funding. And although we remain worried about the role that Harvard’s culture of elitism and competitiveness has in the undergraduate experience, we hope that the diversity of student groups—pre-professional and otherwise—represents a healthy variety of interests and increased opportunities for students to feel included.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
As one of the nation’s premier institutions of higher learning, Harvard is naturally selective in its admissions. A 5.9 percent acceptance rate reflects that. The precise nature of Harvard’s selectivity, however, is a matter of ongoing debate. Harvard aims to build a class of students with high SAT scores, excellent grades, and impressive slates of extracurricular activities. It also aims to build a diverse class, wherein individuals from a wide variety of backgrounds enhance the educational experience of the student body as a whole. With an increasingly competitive pool of applicants, Harvard can achieve this second goal without sacrificing the academic quality of its students. Accordingly, admissions officers at schools like Harvard, Yale, and Princeton wield enormous power, even if they commit to a fair application of academic criteria: For which precocious 17- and 18-year-olds should they throw open the gates?
“Diversity” is a noble goal, but it is also an ambiguous one. In sorting through that ambiguity, the College can and should further its mission as an educational institution facilitating equality of opportunity. Recent increases in the racial and socioeconomic diversity of admitted classes provide reason for celebration. But the designers of Harvard’s admissions policy have a number of kinks and contradictions to hammer out if the school’s admissions philosophy is to be consistent.
First, the positive. Of the 1,031 regular and 992 early applicants receiving offers of admission to the Class of 2018, a record number of students came from minority backgrounds. African American students made up 11.9 percent of those admitted, and Latino students 13 percent. Asian Americans comprised 19.7 percent of admits, and Native Americans and Native Hawaiians 1.9 percent.
This increased diversity was made possible in part by Harvard’s increasingly generous provision of financial aid. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative. As a result of this overhaul, families earning less than $65,000 per year pay nothing for their children to attend Harvard. According to the HFAI website, 90 percent of U.S. families would pay the same or lower tuition at Harvard versus a state school. And the College has rightly recognized that money-fueled imbalances affect the decision to apply in the first place. Low-income outreach programs like the Harvard College Connection now leverage social media to provide socioeconomically disadvantaged students with information about their college and financial aid options.
But there remain important causes for concern with Harvard’s admissions process. A mere 45 percent of admits to the Class of 2018 were female, which represents a significant decrease from the more equal gender distribution of previous years. Dean Fitzsimmons attributes this discrepancy to two causes: first, to the fact that more males than females applied to the College; and second, to a widening interest in concentrations at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, such as engineering, computer science, and applied mathematics. But more available data on the trend in applicant gender would indicate whether this year’s discrepancy reflects a new change in applicant makeup this year or a conscious shift by the College. We wonder if such a slight toward a traditionally marginalized group would be tolerated so easily if that group were not women but, say, an underrepresented minority.
The ongoing practice of privileging candidates whose mothers or fathers attended Harvard also continues to trouble us. While Harvard congratulates itself for its admission of students who are the first in their families to attend college, and many question the legitimacy of race-based affirmative action programs, legacy preference goes largely unchallenged in the public discourse. Granting an additional advantage to legacy applicants—who are disproportionately white and of high socioeconomic status—is strangely at odds with efforts to increase the number of African American and Latino students at the College.
Legacy preference encourages alumni “engagement” with Harvard, the argument goes, increasing their willingness to donate to the University. We are not naive—we understand that money plays an important role in Harvard’s operations, and that the parents of legacies help foot the tuition bills of less fortunate students. In the past, we have called for Harvard to more definitively measure and articulate the opaque benefits—legacy preference should continue only if the College as a whole unambiguously stands to gain from its effects. We know it is possible to operate a world-class educational institution without favoring children of alumni: MIT, Oxford, and Cambridge have no legacy preference. A stronger foundation for University development would rest on genuine interest in an equally-accessed educational mission, rather than on familial connections.
Moreover, the efforts implicit in Harvard’s admissions policy should not end at matriculation. Developments over the course of the past semester highlight the importance of making all members of a diverse student body feel included when they arrive on campus. The “I, Too, Am Harvard,” campaign brought to light the discrimination felt by African American students. An anonymous op-ed on the subject of sexual assault made waves. There were nationwide calls imploring universities to do more to prevent and investigate sexual assault, a necessary measure if women at Harvard and other institutions are to feel safe on campus—now more of a challenge with women a minority here, by a 10 percentage-point spread in the incoming class.
The College pays lip service to diversity and meritocracy and, as the ethnic composition of the Class of 2018 shows, it sometimes follows through. Harvard nonetheless has a long way to go if its admissions practices and the environment it fosters for the members of its community are to align with the goal of educating the deserving—regardless of race, sex, or socioeconomic status—and shaping a better society.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
On March 31 of this year, an anonymous student wrote a harrowing first-person account of sexual assault on Harvard’s campus and the allegedly inadequate response of administrators in an op-ed that captured the attention of the campus community and national media alike.
After seeking recourse from administrators multiple times and failing, the author seemed resigned to the reality that “my assailant will remain unpunished, and life on this campus will continue its course as if nothing has happened.” 
“Dear Harvard: You might have won, but I still have a voice. And I plan on using it as much as I can to make things change,” she wrote.
But things did change. “We must do better,” University President Drew G. Faust wrote in an email to the Harvard community four days later, announcing the creation of a task force chaired by Professor Stephen E. Hyman that would provide recommendations to improve Harvard’s handling of sexual assault. The task force returned four early recommendations in mid-May to President Faust, who accepted them and placed them into immediate effect.
Among the recommendations are increased funding of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Research and a proposal that the University’s constituent schools develop sexual-assault prevention education for their orientation programs in consultation with OSAPR and the Title IX office. Both are important—understaffed and underfunded resources for students dealing with sexual assault risk slow and ineffective responses.
In early May Faust also announced the creation of a committee, composed of faculty and four students that will work on updating the individual schools’ policies to be more in line with the as-of-yet unapproved and unreleased revised university-wide policy. While this is all encouraging, the University has repeatedly come under fire for doing too little. Harvard only appointed a University-wide Title IX Coordinator in March of last year, after a Title IX complaint against Harvard Law School for its sexual assault policies drew an ongoing investigation from the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights. More recently, students filed a complaint against Harvard College this April.
These developments come as a string of high-profile investigations at the University of Connecticut, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and others have drawn national attention to the epidemic of sexual assault on college campuses. The Department of Education made public a list of 55 colleges and universities under investigation for sexual violence policies in conflict with Title IX. Harvard College and Harvard Law School both made the list, unfortunately.
President Barack Obama convened a White House task force in January to address the issue, and the group’s first report released in April rightly faulted many universities for not doing enough to prevent this plague on their campuses and released new guidelines for how schools should combat this problem. The White House also launched a new public service campaign, “1 is 2 Many,” featuring several famous actors, the vice president, and the president, encouraging men “to speak up and step in if they see someone in danger of being sexually assaulted.”
These are productive steps forward at a time when one in five women is sexually assaulted while in college. Yet, there is only so much change that can be instituted from the top—no matter if from individual administrators, university presidents, or the White House itself. A true and permanent change can only come from eliminating the culture of shame, silence, and repression that surrounds sexual violence.
The recommendations of the Harvard task force are in line with that spirit. Funding OSAPR and ensuring robust Title IX enforcement are needed for proper responses, but prevention begins with educating the entire student body on their duty in preventing sexual violence on campus. There can be no idle bystanders.
One easy first step is attending the Sexual Assault Awareness Month events.  Another is to have campus organizations proactively educating themselves on sexual assault prevention.  The new OSAPR liaison program is an example, where school organizations with a significant social component or space are invited to have one or more members participate in a half-day training on sexual assault prevention. The liaisons continue to have biweekly meetings focused on changing the culture of their organization and get continued victim-response training. 
Integrating this education in each school’s orientation programs is an important development. Harvard students should, from the outset of their time here, be made aware and vigilant.
Despite the importance of culture, there is still more that Harvard could do. The College’s policies for disciplining sexual assault, although currently under revision, have not been updated since 1993, and remain inadequate.
The Administrative Board through which victims of sexual assault can seek recourse remains stubbornly stuck to an opaque “sufficiently persuaded” standard. Most of Harvard’s peers have adopted a “preponderance of evidence” standard, which has a much clearer legal basis. Adhering to “sufficiently persuaded”—thought to require a higher threshold than the preponderance of evidence standard recommended by the OCR—makes it more difficult to discipline students accused of sexual misconduct, causing even more strife for their victims.
No student’s time here should be marred by the trauma of a sexual assault, even if it were dealt with in the swiftest and most just way possible. No student should feel so isolated and abandoned that he or she is forced to issue a public plea in order to receive some remedies. 
In the words of President Faust: “Sexual assault should not exist on campus. … It is just totally at odds with everything we believe in and want to be.” Though Harvard is on the way there, we have a lot of work left to create a campus culture that truly practices the mantra “1 is 2 Many.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
From club sports to periodicals to PBHA organizations, you name it I went to the info session freshman fall. There was one activity, however, that I found particularly intriguing. It wasn’t a prestigious publication or a club known for its social caché: It was ballroom dance.
The fact that I resemble a crippled lemur on the dance floor did little to deter me from attending the first info session for the ballroom dance team.
It was during that now-distant time at the beginning of freshman year when we really had no idea where college would take us. Every person we met in Annenberg could become our friend for life, or at the very least someone to pregame with in Canaday. Every poster in the Yard beckoned with our future extracurricular-fueled lives. The ballroom team’s flyer read “Beginners Welcome!” Now that sounded promising.
At that first meeting I arrived with a group of recently made friends. We were all ballroom amateurs, drawn by the desire to join something different than what we had done in high school. Who needed yawn-inducing activities like the yearbook or the newspaper when we could join new, exotic extracurriculars specific to college life?
We watched enraptured as members of the team displayed their dancing skills. A couple performed the rumba. “I could do the rumba,” I thought to myself.
Next, a different pair performed the tango.
The tango appeared to be a little bit outside of my comfort zone.
Despite my misgivings about the tango, I left that meeting honestly believing that I would join the team or at the very least, learn the rumba. After all, they offered many “open” classes, which I would presumably attend regularly even if I didn’t make the grade for the traveling “A team.”
I chatted with my friends, and we all pledged to keep at it. “Seriously, we could do it!” I said. “Yes, seriously!” they replied.
And yet, that word, “seriously” came not to describe our commitment to ballroom dance—I never made it to a single other meeting—but rather to encompass our new view of ourselves and the way we should spend our time at Harvard. We started taking ourselves very, very seriously.
The activities we did became all-consuming and all-important. Sometimes, our self-worth and our GPAs became inextricably linked. The desirable extracurriculars presented themselves as well-known and established, prestigious and selective. Every club I joined claimed to have had T.S. Eliot as a member (T.S. was apparently quite busy during his time at Harvard).
Within that culture of seriousness, one of high achievement and unlimited ambitions, there was little time to spend on pursuits unlikely to take us any further toward a job or those that didn’t seem impressive to our peers.
It would have been ridiculous to spend a single afternoon learning how to ballroom dance, let alone join a club devoted to the practice. I would have just spent a few hours per week learning how to ballroom dance and presumably be laughed at and laugh at myself. I would never have been very good at it anyway. Or so I reasoned then and still do now.
In short, I spent a lot of time working on the newspaper.
I don’t regret doing the things I did—newspaper included. I would have been a terrible ballroom dancer. I cannot imagine myself ever mastering the rumba. But, I could have spent an hour a week laughing at myself. I could have struggled at something while impressing no one at all. I think we all could have benefited from that.

I ended my first night of college at J.P. Licks, eating chocolate ice cream and listening to the president of Hillel as she told me how much she loved her Sanskrit classes. I did not realize that discussing dead languages with friends was how nearly every college evening would play out for me over the next four years.
For me, this time was defined by the verbal, including editing, and occasionally writing, some sentences for this newspaper. I’ve been a bit too comfortable within the beautiful, motionless world of carefully articulated ideas. The vicarious excitement of studying history and literature, and critiquing the present, has worn off.
I am exasperated with my naivete. The blank page held appeal because it came with infinite choice and creative power. But now it seems a prison. It holds my ideas captive. It annihilates and institutionalizes them, making them linear, safe and designed to be appealing to others. The existence of words is contingent upon societally shared meanings. Those shared meanings embody all of the generalizations, inconstancies and prejudices I want freedom from.
My own words are less well suited to explaining my situation than those of a couple of my favorite literary characters, who seemed sensitive to their imprisonment on the page. Isabel Archer asked, “What’s language at all but a convention?” She mentions that it makes no sense to pretend we are able to express ourselves with “original signs,” but awareness makes the reality no less constricting.
Education by way of words has not led to “high places of happiness, from which the world would seem to lie below one, so that one could look down with a sense of exaltation and advantage, and judge and choose and pity, [but] rather downward and earthward, into realms of restriction.”
And despite that, there is a certain freedom to be found within the restrictions imposed by the communal nature of language. It happens when we lose our senses of self in the words of others. As when Lizzy Bennet’s love overcame prejudice to the point that she “listened, wondered, doubted and was impatient for more” when hearing words “most opposite to her ideas.” She discovered unique, intended meaning rather than closing her mind to a projected, constructed meaning.
Can I escape the tyranny of societal meaning and, as much as is possible, replace it with meaning that I create with others, out of passion, understanding, and love? Isabel is right, “we must take our duty where we find it, and we must look for it as much as possible.” My suspicion is that defining our duty in terms that are of our own making is the only way to go forward. For when we create the language by which we conceive, the world becomes immense. “The world, in truth, had never seemed so large; it seemed to open out all around her, to take the form of a mighty sea, where she floated in fathomless waters.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
When you boil it down, the main goal of the college experience is, quite simply, to learn. Sure, a shiny diploma is nice, as is a lifetime of H-bombs (or “going to school in Boston”); an impressive GPA or extracurricular accolade may help land that sweet job post-college. But at a fundamental level, it’s about learning, broadly defined—about yourself, about your passions, and about the world around you.
And so as my four years at Harvard wind down, it’s natural to reflect upon what, and where, I learned.
Admittedly, my views on learning at college are somewhat skewed. As president of The Crimson, I, like many others before me, spent an unhealthy amount of time at 14 Plympton Street. Without a doubt, the most important lessons I learned came not in a classroom but in a newsroom.
Yet, while my specific case may be somewhat unusual, it speaks to a larger truth: At a school known best for and, in large part ruled by, academics, the most enriching learning experiences of an undergraduate’s career can often come in a different place entirely. Certainly for some, academic settings are the sites of greatest learning, yet for others it’s in their houses interacting with peers, or it’s running a club, or debating. For others still, it’s competing as part of a team.
“This is a small classroom, to be honest with you,” longtime Harvard women’s basketball coach Kathy Delaney-Smith told The Crimson for a 2013 story on athletics’ place in the College. “Yes, we’re trying to win, but … the way you win is to develop all of those life skills … and what better way to develop all those life skills on a daily, repeated basis than by being on a team?”
It doesn’t matter particularly where the learning happens. Sure, different activities will teach different lessons and enhance different skills. But Harvard’s greatest luxury is the number of paths it affords its students to learn—a byproduct both of the school’s sheer number of opportunities and the people who fill its classes—and importantly, each of these paths has its own value and importance. 
Yet there is, at times, a prevailing attitude that schoolwork must be students’ main focus. As one professor told The Crimson in the same 2013 story, “If that pressure [to devote less time to academics] is real, then there is a serious imbalance, because Harvard should be a place where academics are the priority.”
This over-prioritization of academics can be seen in other places too, like the perennial reluctance to fund more travel for student groups, or Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay Harris’s recent announcement that the Q Guide will no longer post course difficulty. Harris’s move both bespeaks the notion that students should take classes independent of difficulty and downplays the idea of balancing schedules. 
Thanks to enterprising Computer Science students and their separate course guide, this decision likely will have little to no impact on course selection. Yet, it is intended to push towards a more single-minded definition of what “learning” constitutes, as determined by faculty members—long removed from their college days—who, by evidence of their occupation, likely found that type of learning most productive. 
Yet going down that road limits the school’s tremendous variety. It’s not that academics are not important—they certainly are. But the extent to which they are differs for everyone. For the prospective math professor, they matter and are more exciting, a more fertile ground for learning, than for, say, the average president of The Crimson.
Not only is that OK, it’s the way it should be. It’s an attitude administrators would do well to foster and students would do well to embrace. The more paths available and encouraged, the better off the student body will be, in both the short and long term. For it is in this way that we discover our passions, what makes us tick, and thereby begin to answer the ever-looming question of what it is we plan on doing once our Houses cease to be our homes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
I have a friend. Her hair is copper-colored like the wires poking out of my broken computer charger and she bikes down Mass. Ave. slightly too fast for comfort. She will receive a master’s degree from the University of Cambridge next spring and her thesis on histone deacetylase inhibitors—a synthesis of years in the laboratory—left me befuddled, occasionally, but also impressed, always. For a year, she managed one of the largest and most public student organizations on campus, the Harvard University Band, and her emails are now tinged with the maturity that comes from constant communication with people of authority.
I have no doubt that my friend will one day lead some of our generation’s most innovative and important medical research. She is ambitious, focused, and assiduous. But she is my role model for more than these qualities alone. As with all of the friends and mentors I admire, I look up to her because she is kind, generous, and sincere.
From the very beginning of college, I quickly mastered speedwalking. More days than not during my first seven semesters, the rainbow blocks on my Google calendar stacked back to back to back well past sunset, and I tumbled from class to meeting to rehearsal to Crimson interview like the stereotypical over-committed undergraduate. Often, I had no time to stop by the band room before a Harvard University Band rehearsal, or I needed to run off directly after a performance. So I would text my friend, the musical chemist mentioned above and a fellow flautist, and request her to bring along my flute and music or take it back after rehearsal. Each time, she responded right away. “No problem, Radhika!” or “You got it.” 
The task itself seems trivial; a flute is practically weightless, especially when compared to most other band instruments, and as a senior staff member my friend was invariably in the band room before rehearsal anyway. But for me the gesture was monumental, because it gave me a few extra moments when I did not have to make a choice—I could leave two colored blocks on that gcal back to back. And I will never forget that my friend did not complain once of the favor, nor make me feel that I had burdened her. 
Many times during college I have wondered what I have to offer, not just to my immediate community but to the broader spheres of influence that ripple ever larger as we get older. During crisis after crisis of self-confidence, I have looked at my peers at Harvard and judged myself small by their side: not as forceful, not as funny, not as athletic, not as eloquent, not as engaged in social justice. When I applied to medical school and nearly every university asked me to describe how I would contribute to its diversity, I struggled to articulate why I was special; I could think of nothing that made me exceptional compared to my fellow applicants. 
It was my friend who reminded me that I should not always measure excellence by my position in the hierarchy or the breadth of my impact but rather by the moments of goodness I might share with others. To be good to each other is enough, we decided together during one of our many conversations. No, it is more than “enough”—it is the essential foundation upon which all else rests. I realized that I needed to measure my self-worth in the same way I did hers: first and foremost in units of character.
It is still so important to be ambitious, focused, and assiduous. To study at Harvard is a gift of enormous proportions, an opportunity to learn and grow at a place imperfect but also perfect because it throws us together to think and question and make it, ourselves, and the world—better. We should strive to be leaders; we should strive for our best. But in this striving I hope we remember to draw inspiration not only from the achievements of our role models and friends but also from the ways in which they have been thoughtful, empathetic community-builders. 
Did I slow to smile when our paths crossed on the street today, or did I miss your eyes? Did I surprise a friend with a note today? Did I offer a critique gently, or was I disrespectful? Did I express gratitude for a small gesture? Did I ask for or assume consent? Did I revisit my vocabulary to iron out inadvertent microaggressions? Did I think twice about giving a favor? On this Commencement day, let us draw much confidence and pride not just from the diploma in our hand but from the fact that we anchor our lives around such questions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The last time I took a job that did not involve a pay cut was in 1988. That was the year I graduated from law school. I went to work at a Wall Street law firm, and I stayed there for four years. I learned a ton. I worked hard and was surrounded by very smart lawyers. We spared no expense. We scorched the earth. It was exciting.
But the experience tested my ethical compass, and it coarsened my behavior. I was sometimes a jerk in dealing with my adversaries. I was sloppy in accounting for my time. I managed to care deeply about whether associates at the firm across the street were making a few dollars more. I did almost no pro bono work.
Don’t get me wrong. You get excellent training at big law firms. Many of the lawyers there do good and honorable work. But the big firms are built on a set of ethical tensions.
One of them is rooted in the adversarial system. If better lawyers get better results—and they do—the justice system is easily warped. Justice should not turn on the quality of the lawyer you can afford, but it does.
A second pervasive problem is hourly billing. It leads to punishing work schedules, unhappy lawyers, ill-served clients, over-lawyered cases, perverse incentives, and outright fraud. 
I get a lot of calls from young lawyers looking for advice. Here is the most important thing I tell them. Get the best, highest paying job you can. Try it out. But don’t get used to the money.
Don’t find yourself in this position: You are terribly unhappy in your work (and a lot of lawyers are). You want to make a change. But you are locked into a mortgage and lifestyle that will not allow you to do something else, something that brings you satisfaction, if not joy, and something that makes the world a better place.
If you’re locked in, you won’t be able to be flexible and to think straight when the phone rings and the voice on the other end is talking about a great job in the government or in education or in public service. Leave yourself able to say yes when the phone rings. Leave yourself free to follow your heart.
My heart told me to leave my law firm. So I took a pay cut to go in-house. For a decade, I was a First Amendment lawyer in the legal department of the New York Times Company, which was then a thriving media conglomerate. I gave legal advice to journalists, tried to help them get access to information, and fought subpoenas and lawsuits. It was a sleepier job than working at a firm, but I admired my clients and was happy to help them.
You probably have a dream job. I confess that mine was to be a reporter for the New York Times. You may think I’m crazy, that I could have picked a better dream. But hey, dreams aren’t supposed to make sense.
 I didn’t quite know how to achieve my dream, which is why I practiced law for 14 years before turning to journalism. But I did know that I could at least get in the neighborhood of journalism, so I concentrated on First Amendment law and then worked in the Times’s legal department. I once heard a great piece of advice from Judge Robert D. Sack of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. He was asked the secret to getting your dream job. Here’s what he said: “Hang around the hoop and hope someone gives you the ball.”
One day I got the ball and I grabbed it. And I took another pay cut to do it. 
All three jobs—at a firm, in a corporate law department, in a newsroom—were good jobs. But each one made me happier than the last. Each one was more satisfying than the last. Each one was I think more valuable than the last. 
As a purely economic matter, I suppose I made stupid choices. But life is not a purely economic matter.
You’ll make your own calculations. But you will be making a mistake if all of those calculations are financial.

In the next year, there is one question that will control your life. It is a part of your dreams, a part of your nightmares, a part of your every waking moment:
Why?
This is not the “Why?!?!” shouted in the heads of hundreds in dining halls across Harvard the night before a big exam, or the “Why?!” of the Winthrop resident who cannot walk through the back gate of Harvard’s most illustrious house. This “why” is the question that you’ve likely avoided for the better part of your college life, and the one that is worth agonizing over.
In order to fully engage in the work that you have set out to do next year, you will have to find the purpose behind your choices and the motivations for them. There are no ifs, ands, or buts about it. 
So sit down. Grab a piece of paper and a pencil, or don’t. Write it down or think out loud. Why do you do the things you do? Why do you value the things that you do? Why, why, why?
This question was posed to me in my second month of teaching: “Mr. Acevedo, you went to Harvard, so you probably had other choices. No offense, you’re cool and all, but why are you here? This is East Los Angeles. ... I mean, you know.”
It was a loaded question that involved a history of perceived and real neglect. It was a question that made me cringe and made me want to hug that student. She said it because the vast majority of teachers from last year did not come back. She expressed feeling like she had been abandoned. I told her that I was there because I saw myself and my friends in each one of them. Her question led me to really examine what my motivations are for the work that I do.
My purpose is crafted from pieces of my parents’ experiences in the war-torn country of El Salvador in the 1980s, of an upbringing in one of the toughest neighborhoods in Los Angeles, and of the stark educational inequities that I experienced in public and private schools. 
I get up in the mornings because, no matter how bad my night of work was, I have students who are struggling with shots fired in their housing developments, with mental health issues that their school isn’t nearly prepared enough to help them deal with, with families that struggle with substance abuse, and with living environments that sometimes excuse domestic abuse. 
What’s your purpose? What gets you up in the morning? Why are you not doing something else? Why are you standing in the very spot that you are standing in right now?
Your reflection should not be divorced from action. The best part is this: You get to define what that means. When we reflect, we are reminded that we don’t have to be where we are now. We are not slaves to our current conditions. If you chose to be somewhere, you chose it for a reason. Make that reason matter like your soul depends on it. It does.

This is my 50th Commencement and my last as an active professor, since I’m becoming emeritus at the end of this academic year. I’ve taught nearly 10,000 students and learned much from them. This is a very different and much better place than it was 50 years ago. The diversity of the student body—virtually everybody was a white male back in 1964—has added much to my education. I learn more from my students than I did back in the day.
People often long for the good old days, but for the most part, the present is better than the past and the future will be better than the present. That is largely your responsibility as graduates, and from what I know of you, I expect much. 
Now the inevitable few words of advice from an old fogey: My first suggestion is somewhat counterintuitive. Don’t necessarily do what you are best at. Some of the least happy people I know are those who figure out what they are best at and then tailor the job to their particular expertise. The problem is that what you’re best at is not necessarily what gives you the most gratification or what is most important. Our educational system steers students toward courses and areas in which they excel. Grades are, after all, quite important to getting into college and law school.
It’s alright to take courses in which you will excel. But courses only last only a few months. Life is forever. So pick a career, or an area within your career, that balances excellence and gratification. It should challenge you every day and have you waking up eager to confront the day’s challenges. Obviously, you don’t want to pick something you’re not ever good at, no matter how much you might enjoy it. If I had decided on a career I enjoyed but was not very good at, I would be playing point guard for the Boston Celtics. Instead, I picked a career I love and one that I’m pretty good at. 
Second, don’t live for the weekends. You never want to be in a career where you’re always saying, “Thank God it’s Friday.” You want a career where you can’t wait until Monday. 
We’ve all heard the cliché, “Nobody on their death bed ever regretted not having spent more time at the office.” Sure! If you achieved a high degree of professional and financial success during your lifetime. But the reality is that there are many people who should regret not having spent more time at work. These are the people who failed to achieve their potential because of laziness or misplaced priorities. We rarely hear their deathbed regrets: “Damn, I should have spent more time working and less time with my ungrateful kids and the wife who left me for a more successful guy.”
So strike a proper balance among work, play, and family. Better yet, try to integrate the various aspects of your life so that there is no sharp separation.
Most important, live the passion of your times. Passion should not be reserved for the bedroom. It must extend to your life’s work. You will spend far more time and energy working than making love—or playing sports or eating or listening to the opera. Yet the common advice for Harvard graduates is to be dispassionate, removed, objective, detached—in a word, professional. There is no inconsistency between passion and professionalism, so long as each is employed appropriately.
Passion is the motivator. Professionalism is the means by which the task is carried out. Even if the means requires objectivity and detachment, passion can stimulate the best use of these tools.
Don’t let the passion of your times pass you by. I have a psychological malady called FOMS—fear of missing something! It’s contagious. Catch it. Don’t regret missing things. I certainly haven’t. 
Most important, enjoy life. It goes by so quickly. Make the most of it. Do great things and do them greatly, unapologetically, with passion, enjoyment and a love of life.
Let me end with a thank you—a thank you to 50 years of students who have taught me that education doesn’t end with graduation, and that it continues throughout one’s lifetime. I have learned so much from my students and for that I will be forever grateful.

I’m pretty sure that, all its defensive sputtering aside, Harvard will eventually divest its holdings in fossil fuel companies. Four reasons come to mind:
First, the logic of the divestment campaign has so far gone unassailed. No researcher, and not even any oil executive, has disputed the core idea students have been putting forward for two years now: The fossil fuel industry has many times more carbon in its reserves than researchers calculate the atmosphere can handle. If Exxon et al. follow through on the promises made to shareholders and governments—the promises to dig up their reserves and sell them—then this industry will make massive climate change inevitable: There’s no mystery about it anymore, no drama. If they carry out their business plans, the planet tanks.
Once you know those numbers, these are no longer normal companies. They are rogues, breaking not the laws of the nation, but the laws of physics. And there is no gentle way to rein in rogues: So far this year, both Exxon and Shell have made formal announcements that they plan to burn everything in their reserves and keep on hunting for more hydrocarbons. Having the proverbial “seat at the table” to discuss change is, in these cases, useless, since there’s not a fixable flaw in the business plan of these firms. The business plan is the flaw.
Students know all this—they understand the grave importance of this battle. They know that heroes of the past, like Desmond Tutu, have joined their voices to the call. But they know, much more, that their future demands action. If we can’t quickly break the power of the fossil fuel industry, then we’ll never get the logical steps, like a tax on carbon, that would give us some chance of breaking out of our global logjam. That’s why students have proceeded with such vigor: polite and well-informed, but firm and persistent. They are organizing with all the passion of their predecessors in the eras of civil rights or Indochinese war—and with the all the networking might that comes in the age of Facebook and Twitter.
And—probably most crucially—students have a great ally in their fight. Not just the faculty, who have begun to chime in loudly; not just alumni, most of whom have graduated in the years since we started understanding climate change. But most of all Mother Nature.
Every week she adds another sad but powerful layer to the case against carbon. This month, it was not just the record heat spawning fires in San Diego or record rains producing monster floods in Bosnia; it was also the gut-wrenching news from the South Pole that the West Antarctic ice sheet is now in motion, melting with sinister speed as warm water begins to float it from beneath. Harvard owns a piece of those fires and floods; all of us who’ve made a donation have a share in that melt. That’s literally where the money that we’ve given over the years is now invested. 
College administrators have an ever-bright hope that their student adversaries will graduate and issues will disappear. But in this case, the flood of horrifying data will only grow, a mounting toll that will eventually grind down even the mighty Harvard Corporation. At some point—as Stanford has already concluded—they’ll figure out that they don’t want to be on the wrong side of the greatest crisis our species has ever wandered into.
But damn, let’s hope it doesn’t take as long as it did for Harvard to begin, grudgingly, to divest from apartheid South Africa. Because global warming is a timed test, and every semester that goes by digs our hole deeper. Students will win this fight, but the rest of us need to help them win quickly.
So write a letter to Massachusetts Hall—a letter, not a check. Tell them you love Harvard, love it enough that you want to see it live up to the standard set by its physicists and philosophers. Divest because of the typhoon in the Philippines and the rapidly acidifying ocean. Divest because we’re headed for the sixth great extinction. Divest because Harvard disgraces herself when she arrests peaceful protesters. Divest because if you’re alive when the Antarctic begins to disintegrate and you don’t act, then your soul will start to wither. Divest because this place, so soaked in the past, is really about the future—a future that won’t exist unless we get very fast to work.

To students of the College,
Writing letters has been one of the joys I have had as Interim Dean and it has been gratifying that many of you have appreciated them.  Indeed, I have been surprised by the positive reception the letters have received and have asked myself how it can be that a mode of communication as seemingly old-fashioned as an email became an event that you anticipated.  I know that you find the letters funny and quirky. I know that my family would agree on the quirky part.
I hope you have taken seriously some of the advice about caring for yourself and your friends.
I am impressed that you have enjoyed some of the natural history lessons on topics derived from observations in the Yard.  Indeed, right now you can find inky-cap mushrooms (a species of the genus Coprinus) there.  They are on the ground around trees and buried stumps.  The flesh of this mushroom dissolves leaving a black, gooey mass that can be used as ink.  Remember this when you want to leave a note and have lost your pen.  Also as you walk through the Yard these days you will see, on the ground and floating in the air, the disc-shaped, winged fruits of the elms—millions and millions of them.
In my regular letters the following section would be where I mention some of the activities you have undertaken—performances, scholarship, inspired events.  In this letter I will mention three of the mentors, now no longer with us, who were important to me in the 40 years I have been at Harvard.
I admired Mason Hammond ’25, professor of classics and master of Kirkland House from 1945 to 1955.  Professor Hammond was an imposing character.  He was the original Monument Man. He wrote a guide to the Latin inscriptions found around Harvard. He led the Kirkland graduates to chapel on Commencement morning until he was well into his 80s.  Once at Kirkland House, when I was fussing over how the chairs were set-up or some other trivial thing, Mason’s wife, Florence, said to me, “Oh, you are just like Mason, he has the soul of a janitor.”  I took it as a compliment.
Geneva Sayre spent her teaching life at Russell Sage College in Troy, New York.  She studied mosses, the literature devoted to their description, and the history of the 18th and 19th century expeditions on which these plants were collected. She came to Harvard in retirement to use the collections and library at the Farlow Library and Herbarium. She arrived a few years before I showed-up as an assistant professor and curator at the Herbarium. She taught me to be patient and to write carefully, and she, a former department chair, instructed me in the politics of academics.  Although we were at opposite ends of our careers we became friends and worked together to make the collections at the Farlow better and more accessible.
Reed C. Rollins was director of Harvard’s Gray Herbarium and Asa Gray Professor of Systematic Botany. He was the chair of the search committee that brought me here.  He studied plants in the mustard family but also did research, in the World War II years, on Guayule (a member of the sunflower family), an alternative source of natural rubber.  He was from Wyoming; indeed he grew-up on a ranch with many siblings, and came to Harvard first as a Junior Fellow.  After a stint at Stanford he came back to Harvard.  He was Director of the Gray Herbarium for all of his years on the faculty.  After his retirement he did field work in the West and in Mexico in order to augment a major treatise on the mustard family in North America. He was the person I could turn to for advice on topics from taxonomy, nomenclature, and systematic biology to buying a house.  He was a wonderfully supportive colleague and friend.
I am still reading Jon Meacham’s “American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House.”  I started this because it was there. If a reviewer gives a book the thumbs-up my wife and I are likely to pick it when we are at a bookshop.  The result: two rooms taken over by bookshelves and stacks of books in almost every room.  Friends give us books, our children take books—we are the center of a swarm of books that go visiting and come home again.  So, what I read is often determined by what is home at the time.  Mysteries and histories are favorites.  Mysteries because of the ingenuity it takes to write a really good one. Histories have a way of relating to my curatorial job.  Reading about Jackson I am reminded that I have studied the specimens collected on the United States Exploring Expedition (1838-1842) and that it was in his administration that the expedition began to take form.
This is the last of my little missives as interim dean.  Thank you for a great year. Please remember to stop by and see me at my office in the Harvard Herbaria.
With fond memories,
Donald Pfister

Some people buy a motorcycle. For the occasion of my own 25th college reunion, I’ve decided to speak my mind about the relationship between elite colleges and social inequality. For reasons I’ve outlined elsewhere, I believe this and global warming are my generation’s defining failures. I further believe that though elite colleges have a moral obligation to combat social inequality, they’re actually making the situation worse. A basic data point is stunning: According to The Crimson’s 2013 Freshman Survey, as many entering Harvard students come from families in the top one percent of earners as from the bottom 50 percent.
I’ve been working with a group of current Harvard students and recent graduates to create an alternative endowment that will hold contributions in escrow pending Harvard’s ending of legacy preferences, inquiry into ability to pay, and communication between the development and admissions offices. These steps wouldn’t be sufficient to cure inequity in higher education, but they would be a substantial step in the direction of fairness and equal access.
I’ve been heartened by the responses we’ve received as we’ve begun to make this case; I’ve personally received hundreds of emails from current and former students who feel ostracized and think that access to private colleges is fundamentally flawed. It’s clear, though, that a challenge we’ll face in making this argument is how to communicate the need for dramatic change without suggesting that individual legacies are to blame or expressing disrespect for the institution. I feel neither of these sentiments. To the contrary, I feel quite warmly about Harvard. I root for the basketball team and I’m always happy when I have the chance to walk in the Yard. At the same time, I think Harvard needs to do a lot more than it does, and I wish that reunions would have a focus on social justice. These messages seem perfectly consistent to me but I understand not to everyone. The irony is that Harvard’s homogeneity is at the root of these different worldviews.
It’s been my odd lot to spend half my life in a universe of privilege and the other in what I’ll call, for want of a better word, the real world. At John Jay College of Criminal Justice, I’ve taught many students who scored over 2100 on their SATs and easily could handle the work at Harvard. In 14 years, though, I’ve yet to meet a single one who said he or she applied to an Ivy League college. They simply don’t think it’s within their grasp. About half of my students come from families making less than $30,000 per year. Almost all of them work. About half work more than 20 hours per week. To them, it seems perfectly natural to say that elite colleges are rewarding in the name of merit qualities which are really the product of opportunity, and that there’s nothing personal whatsoever in making this argument.
At Harvard, where I taught undergraduate sections for three years during law school, I never met a single student who told me they worked full-time. I’m not making any judgment—I don’t want my children to work their way through school—I’m simply pointing out the gross disparity between the experiences of kids who attend elite and public colleges. 
A consequence of this difference is that some privileged types allow themselves to be consoled by false claims, such as the idea that a majority of rejected Harvard applicants are incapable of handling the work or that the SAT measures ability to succeed in college. If one correctly rejects these premises, for example, you’re much less likely as to hear the statement “legacies don’t deserve special treatment” as a personal statement than as either a rejection of the concept of “desert” or a much broader conception of what makes one “deserving” of a place in college, which is what it’s intended to be. 
Among the most fascinating parts of “The Price of Admission” by Daniel L. Golden ’78 are the stories told by the kids of wealthy donors to rationalize the preferential treatment that they received. Inevitably they conclude that they deserve their spot because they worked hard in high school, or because their parents earned their wealth, or because their network will be a contribution to the college. These are legitimate perspectives. My students would say that they are equally deserving of a spot because they too worked hard, and are capable of handling the work, and because their life experiences would be a substantial contribution to the college. These are also legitimate perspectives. 
Of course, today we only treat the first of these perspectives as legitimate—not because of reasoned deliberation, but simply as an assertion of power and wealth in defense of the status quo. It’s impossible to imagine this persisting in a university with equal access and meaningful class diversity. In such a place, perspectives about the entitlement to wealth and privilege would be forced to compete with and accommodate perspectives on the innumerable life events and conditions that can inhibit a child from reaching his or her full potential. It would be a fraught, gut-wrenching, personal conversation drawing on many academic perspectives. As a teacher, it’s almost impossible to imagine something more exciting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
An open secret circulates in University Hall: Compared to their peers at other institutions, Harvard students are deeply unhappy and dissatisfied with their campus experience. The recent “I, Too, Am Harvard” campaign reveals some of the reasons for this discontent, and, through The Diversity Report, minority students make concrete suggestions about much that needs to be done. However, an overarching lesson in these developments must not be missed. As a Harvard alumnus, former Harvard professor, and parent of a graduating senior, I have come to understand this lesson firsthand.
Two years ago, a very highly accomplished Harvard classmate of mine—a white male—told me, “At Harvard, we never really learned anything in class. We were smart enough to bullshit our way through.” My friend had evidently mastered the art of the superior gesture, clever ellipsis, and obscure allusion that embarrassed his audience (including many professors) into presuming his intelligence and not demanding proof for his pronouncements. By contrast, I tended to read the whole book, underline, summarize, and highlight in search of evidence for my own often contrary interpretations. He graduated cum laude; I graduated magna.  And we are both at the top of our professions. 
At Harvard and in the U.S. generally, some people’s lack of melanin confers an automatic benefit of the doubt. On the other hand, I still hesitate to leave any probative detail out of my publications. The disadvantage is that I write long. But I make points that come out of my distinctive experience. 
My friend’s revelation also helped me understand what several white female faculty colleagues told me during the 18 years that I taught at Harvard. They said the key to demonstrating authority in department and in general faculty meetings is just to speak. Just speak, even if you haven’t yet figured out what you want to say. Due to my own racial insecurities, I needed to formulate my ideas evidentially and syllogistically before I talked. Some of my colleagues in the academy, however, hid their equally human insecurities behind a shiny armor of whiteness and opaque language, or silence.
On more than one occasion at Harvard faculty meetings, when a questionable decision was announced, I would turn to an older, white male colleague and whisper, “What happened?” One such colleague whispered back, “I don’t know. I’ve been here for 30 years, and sometimes I still don’t know what’s going on!” He had no more courage to speak up than I did.
However, there was one occasion when parliamentary procedure was violated so unfairly that I stood up and said no. I was virtually alone in the subsequent fight. But I called the bluff because Harvard belongs to no one more that it belongs to me, and I have a permanent stake in Harvard’s fairness to all, and, because of my race, a greater stake than most.
But it is not black students and faculty alone who feel the need to prove ourselves against doubters (even if we do so more than others). So I fully understand the sentiments behind the editorial that helped provoke the “I, Too, Am Harvard” Campaign.
In November 2012, Sarah R. Siskind ’14 wrote a column in The Crimson in which she lamented, “I am kept up at night by the thought that simply because my father has attended and donated to the University, I might have taken the spot of a more qualified applicant.” However, she took comfort in pointing a finger at her brown and black classmates, even claiming that her campaign was an attempt to spare them the humiliation of having their degrees regarded as worthless.
In her article and a presentation in the “Harvard Speaks” lecture series, Siskind says she is “picking on” racial affirmative action: first because the real indices of disadvantage are poverty, femaleness, descent from the enslaved, Jewishness, etc., and not “race” (which is but a false proxy), and second, because, to her, the products of affirmative action are like “visually impaired pilots.”
Through clever ellipsis, Siskind pretends that white women, whose sex is equally visible, have not been the greatest beneficiaries of affirmative action. She also forgets that it took a world war to secure equal rights for Jews. She confesses that the legacy of racial slavery can never be righted, but she sweeps under the rug the well-documented forms of ongoing racial discrimination and exclusion that affirmative action has been used, quite effectively, to offset.
So why does Siskind bring up her legacy status and father’s donations, and then assume they won’t make her one more “visually impaired pilot?” Because of her confidence that people who look like her (or her father) will be in power and therefore keep the secret of her own dangerous impairments? Siskind’s gymnastic effort to question the worth of race as one of the numerous characteristics considered in admissions, while leaving the issue of her unearned privileges unquestioned, is no balanced analysis and no expression of concern for the stigmatized. The problem of racism is and has always entailed the taken-for-granted privileges of some races, as well as the explicit handicapping and exclusion of others.
So what is it that distinguishes black students and faculty from others, like Siskind? 
Throughout the history of both the U.S. and Harvard, we have been unable to hide. The canonization of the Declaration of Independence alongside the maintenance of racialized slavery branded black people as uniquely and hereditarily unworthy of the equality of opportunity promised to every other citizen.
And our nation has yet to supersede this history. A recent study showed that emailed appeals for mentorship from equally qualified people were considerably more likely to be answered if the sender’s name seemed to belong to a white male. Similarly distinct and significant is the effect of applicants’ race on job and bank loan applications and of defendants’ race on conviction rates and length of imprisonment for equal crimes. Such cases demonstrate not just the reality of systemic discrimination but also the processes by which white people of all classes benefit from their own form of affirmative action every day of their lives. 
But I have no doubt that America and Harvard belong to me and I to them. One reason is that the role of being the perennial Constitutional Other of the nation and of the University gives many black people a clarity of mission unclouded by the option, available to Siskind, of pointing a finger at others in order to hide their own vulnerability. The “I, Too, Am Harvard” campaign exemplifies this insight. Therefore, I urge the Harvard community to follow The Diversity Report with care. They stand to learn a great deal about what many have chosen to overlook.
And to all you fellow sons and daughters of Harvard—whatever your color, ethnicity, region of origin, gender, sexual orientation, class, or professional rank: Can you feel the alienation that we feel, in a place you have every right to feel is your own? The “I, Too, Am Harvard” campaign is the proverbial “canary in the coalmine.” Once we all see ourselves in that coalmine, we may find a path toward cleaner air.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
When I graduated from Harvard in 1975 it rained. Not a sprinkle but a torrential downpour that soaked our robes and our armbands demanding equal admissions for women to Harvard College.
Not only did our big day defy the decades old maxim that it never rains on a Harvard graduation, but the economy was also in a dismal state. In reaction to the oil shocks and gas rationing, the economy had shut down and there were no jobs, even for Harvard grads. 
Much like then, today’s jobless recovery is a source of anxiety for many of the Class of 2014. Though Harvard students have a myriad of opportunities and many of you have jobs lined up or plans for graduate or professional school, I am sure that most of you wonder whether the future will be for you and your classmates as secure as you might have once imagined. 
If history is any indication, some of the women and men sitting in the Yard on Thursday morning will decide to create their own jobs. Following a great tradition of Harvard graduates (and non-graduates), many will start and grow their own businesses. 
Entrepreneurship is America’s secret sauce. We are the envy of other countries as millions of our citizens take risk and open their own startup businesses in pursuit of the American Dream. Entrepreneurship has become a critical part of the American economy, as small businesses create two out of every three net new jobs in this country.
Some of the class of 2014 might take an early route to entrepreneurship. Others could wait until the second half of their life to become “encore entrepreneurs”. In fact, according to the Kauffman Foundation, more people over the age of 55 start new businesses than young people right out of college.
And entrepreneurship is playing an ever more important role in solving society’s most difficult problems across the globe. This is the focus of the work of Tracy Palandjian ’93, (and current Harvard overseer) the co-founder and CEO of Social Finance, which aims to connect the social sector with capital markets.
Whatever your path, now more than ever in our recent history, it is essential that Harvard and its graduates play a leadership role in shaping the future of this country. You can make an important impact as scientists and engineers who make new discoveries and partner with others to turn your innovations into enterprises. Or you can create a new service or program as entrepreneurs and leaders who make a difference in the world by starting businesses and nonprofits. 
So, to paraphrase the words of President Drew Faust in her speech last fall in Sanders Theater, opening the capital campaign, here is my wish for the class of 2014:
May Harvard and its graduates today be as wise as they are smart, 
as restless as they are proud, 
as bold as they are thoughtful, 
and as good as they are great.

To graduate from this great university, ranked first of all universities in the world, is a great privilege. It also brings with it equally great responsibility. And the graduating class of 2014, like the hundreds that have preceded it, will know this in their bones.
As someone who is neither a Harvard graduate nor an American, I know this from experience: When you meet Harvard graduates in countries around the world, there is an automatic expectation of excellence in their field of study, research, or professional endeavor. And so the lifelong challenge for Harvard graduates is to continue to live up to this enduring expectation. 
When “Veritas” was chosen as the University motto, I presume it was for no idle reason. The founders believed, as the world now expects, that this university’s graduates would be in the core business of the lifelong pursuit of the truth of things, both for its own intrinsic virtue, but also in the service of humankind, and will be straining every sinew in the course of that pursuit.
Service to the community, your country, and, more importantly, the world writ large thus constitutes the further part of this university’s unwritten charter. This should never be seen as some sort of fleeting philanthropic commitment, or as a calculated program in networking, branding or personal advancement. Very simply, for those to whom much has been given, much will be expected.
And that, in a nutshell, is how the world feels about Harvard. The aggregate brainpower of its alumni and their capacity to organize is of itself of sufficient capacity and quality to deliver at least a major dent to most of the great problems of the age in which we live.
My own field is Sinology. And here, Harvard has great talents within its tent: Those who understand the depth and breadth of Chinese civilization itself, and those who embrace, engage, and, from time to time, contest China in the multitude of policy and professional fields that China now impacts across the world—from mechatronics to macroeconomics, and from missile modernization to metaphysics.
This 2014 graduating class will be among the last to emerge into a world where America is indisputably number one, starting with the size of its economy. In this sense, the classes of the second decade of this century will have much in common with those graduating in the 1870s, when the Europeans, not the Americans, still dominated the global economy. 
One of the core questions of our century is how China and America can negotiate this great transition in a manner that preserves a Pax Pacifica, maintains regional prosperity, enhances sustainability, and is based on a sufficient commonality of interests and values to underpin it all.
Because Harvard has such a vast Sino-American alumni network, as well as an equally vast body of knowledge between them, the University is marvelously placed to conceptualize, to incubate, and to operationalize new cooperative dimensions to the future relationship between China and the U.S., a relationship that will be so critical for us all.
Deep traditions of scholarship and service to the world also have further utility for the wider Harvard community. The happiest people I have met in life are those who are serving a higher purpose beyond themselves, their paycheck, and their careers. The unhappiest are those who are not. And that goes for the graduating Class of 2014 as well.
Lives enriched by the deep satisfaction that comes from a commitment to professional excellence, lives ennobled both by a sense and sensibility of service, and lives worth living through the sheer joy of giving—for some this might be seen as the road less travelled. But in fact it is the path to a life well lived.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Everyone gets a little wiser during Commencement week. In economic terms, the world experiences something like a wisdom bubble. Advice that, in normal market conditions, has roughly the worth of Confederate currency, or zucchini—“Don’t be afraid to fail!” “The world has never been more complex and interrelated!” “Wear sunscreen!”—becomes inflated with inspirational and nutritional value. The moral economy produces a glut of sensible sayings. Gravitas is all around. Some people are even able to exchange it for honorary degrees. By June, though, you can’t give the stuff away.
Professors are sometimes imagined to be persons engaged in the wisdom supply business, and we are therefore often called upon to meet this urgent but temporally circumscribed demand. Some professors require less inducement than others to disburse the needed commodity.
I’ve always been suspicious of the belief that professors possess greater wisdom about life than doormen or airplane pilots do. What makes people assume this? Maybe it’s because we give grades, and pilots and doormen don’t.
However, we do know something about education, most of us having spent, since approximately age three, our entire lives in the business, either on the consumption or the production end. And one thing we know about education is that it teaches us how little we know, and how little we will ever know. Graduating seniors: Take one last look at the Courses of Instruction. There are 8,000 courses listed in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Most of you took 32. Meaning that there are 7,968 you will never take. Even if, say, three quarters of those courses are too advanced or esoteric for you, you still left hundreds of courses on the table.
Education is about empowerment and skilling and confidence building and all those robust good things. But it’s also about learning that you, by yourself, are not all that supersmart and omnicompetent. College is the place where this humbling is supposed to happen. High school hot shots are like philosophers in the days before the Scientific Revolution: 4.0s in everything. Four years later, those same people discover that they are the assistant sous chefs in the kitchen of knowledge, quite good at shredding the carrots, but not much else. As long as the world continues to want high-IQ carrot shredders, they will do fine. But they will never be asked to poach the plums.
The reason professors know all about this kind of humility is because as the graduating senior is to the Courses of Instruction, we professors are to our own disciplines. Universities produce specialists (that’s what Ph.D. programs are for) and they reward specialization (that’s what tenure is about). And the more specialized we become, the less we know of what the specialist next door knows, even if the specialist is in the same department.
Universities operate this way on the principle of the division of labor. You get a better product if you use the best-trained expert to make each component, like in an automobile assembly line. Of course, at the end of the automobile assembly line, there is a car. At the end of college, there is… whatever remains from those 32 courses.
This is why the social side of college life is as important as the academic side. You did learn a lot, after all, even if it was a fraction of what is still out there to learn. But a ton of education, not just emotional but intellectual, happened on the social side (which includes interactions with your peers in the classroom). That’s what justifies the price of four years in a residential college. You learn that to solve any problem or to create any product, you need other people. You can’t do it all by yourself. So keep in touch with your friends.
Oh, and the best advice is probably Augustine’s: Love God, and do what you like.

As you chart your agenda, enlarge your aspirations from what lies immediately ahead to what lies far in the future. Every decision about the present and the near future charts a line that may be followed to the horizon. When the outer limit of that trajectory engenders doubts, it is wise to consider rethinking your near-term strategy—whether in career decisions or personal relationships.
Aspire to reshape the world in which you find yourself. Your imagination, your ideals, your intellectual acuity, your success are all means to effect a redrawing of societal values and priorities. You cannot be a force for good in the world unless you look beyond your personal situation. Whether helping those whose existence is compromised by circumstance, solving urgent social, scientific, and environmental problems, or altering the spirits of your fellow human beings through artistic or philosophical revelations, your actions can and must make a difference.
But before you change the world, you must transform yourself. All of us struggle with an awareness of frailties that challenge our sense of self-worth. Even the greatest material success is often undermined by self-doubt. To allow uncertainty or worries about inadequacy to cloud our daily existence creates a cage from which we may not easily escape; even should we reach material success beyond all expectations and dreams, self-loathing can snatch all fruits of worldly accomplishment from us.
The path to fulfillment and to making a difference begins with self-acceptance. The ability to judge ourselves affectionately but without illusion is where we must begin. Acknowledging our weaknesses is the prologue to rising above them, for only when we achieve the ability to understand and accept our faults as well as our strengths can we reshape ourselves with patience and confidence. And as we grow within ourselves, so we can and should interact with others to mutual benefit.
When the sand in our personal hourglass has run out, how shall we be remembered? What will our legacy be? A nurse who brings relief to a victim in a battle-scarred distant country, a teacher in an inner-city school who brings hope and the tools to combat and rise above prejudice and disadvantage, a scientist who invents a life-rescuing medication or a process that changes daily lives around the world, an anthropologist that alters forever our understanding of our origins, a poet or musician who quietly sets pen to paper with a message that will bring tears to all future generations—all of us have within us the power to create a potential bequest in our outreach to our fellow human beings.  My life as an artist has been dedicated to inspiring fellow musicians to keep audiences up at night with incandescent and shattering messages of ecstasy and terror, of heroism and tenderness.  Every human domain offers parallel opportunities.
We may often feel that our fate seems to be to trudge through the mud of natural catastrophe and personal sorrow, but with our eyes fixed confidently on the stars, we can, and must, astonish ourselves and those all around us by transforming the world in ways great and small.
With an open mind, a glowing spirit, and a full heart, the world beckons. There is not a moment to be lost. Hail, farewell, and until our next meeting!

In his “Autobiography,” Benjamin Franklin describes the moment when, at the age of 20, he decided to undertake “the bold and arduous project of arriving at moral perfection.” His reasoning goes like this: I know what is right and wrong, so I should simply “always do the one and avoid the other.” Easy! Franklin develops a list of virtues to help himself along: beginning with Temperance (“drink not to elevation”), and ending with Humility (“imitate Jesus and Socrates”).
But he soon realizes that he can maintain only one or two of these virtues at a time—tranquility gets in the way of industry, resolution steamrolls moderation, and so on. More often than not, Franklin falls short of the virtues to which he aspires. But, he insists, it is all worth it—there is value in aspiration itself, in effort and belief, and in the lessons of failure.
Those of us charged with instructing and mentoring students at Harvard recognize that a 20-year-old with the sense that good might be done in the world is a powerful and precious thing. And we assemble here some of the most promising 20 year-olds in the world. They arrive ready to form their lists of virtues, and they listen carefully to what we say and do: not just in words at convocation and Commencement, but also in the deeds of our collective daily life.
Because students are watching and listening so closely, the choices Harvard makes about what to say, and how to say it, have the potential to either shore up or undermine our other work.  How do we respond to a recent failure of good governance, or argue against fossil fuel divestment, or time the announcement of an unpopular decision? Very often, we have relied on a kind of vocalizing apparatus: lawyers, communications people, or others who would prefer that nothing ever had to be said at all.  When we do hear a real voice, too often it is trying to say as little as possible.
But what are we here to do, if not to say what matters?
Harvard’s power in the world derives not just from its production of knowledge, but also from the integrity of its voice. A place as big and important as Harvard should have the courage to try and speak not from a calculated distance, but humanly, with real voices aiming for their objects. It should welcome the full chorus and cacophony of those voices whenever it is productive to do so. Because this is where our students—a category that frankly includes us all—learn whether or not to chime in and try to speak the truth also. Part of our mission is to send students into the world to countervail untruth and ignorance wherever they find it, whether in the lab or in the Capitol. If what they learn here, by our example, is to be doubtful of the wisdom of doing that in their own voices, then we have failed them fundamentally.
Is it a little naive to think that if we can just “speak truly,” the world will be better? Perhaps—but I find myself in good company believing it. Our own William James told an audience in 1896: “We want to have a truth; we want to believe that our experiments and studies and discussions must put us in a continually better and better position towards it.” We want to believe, and we want to believe together, which is in some ways the most important point of all. This is a bold and arduous common project, to educate young women and men to lead us bravely in their turn. We will fail at it, perhaps as much as we succeed. But we have to try, and we have to do it out loud.
 
Halfway down the list of Franklin’s virtues is Sincerity. The starch has gone out of this word for us, in the 21st century, but here is how Franklin glosses it: “Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and if you speak, speak accordingly.” If I have a hope for Harvard, for our graduates, and for all of us, it is this: that we should speak more sincerely, recognizing that the earned authority of our voices is our greatest asset. The practice of this humble virtue surely clears the way for all of the others.
Except perhaps Temperance. For that one, you’re on your own.

When I was an undergraduate in England, one of my professors suddenly stopped halfway through his lecture. “Research shows that people your age can only concentrate for 25-minute bursts, so there is no point me carrying on,” he said. “Let’s take a break. But, rather than waste that time, let’s learn something random.”
He then described how to survive when approached by a bear. “If a grizzly bear attacks, play dead! However, if a black bear attacks, fight back!” He added an important qualification: “Only if you are sure that the black bear is a mother protecting her cubs … play dead!” The class erupted with laughter. 
I do not remember anything else from that course. I can’t even remember its subject. Fluid dynamics? Optimization? But I do remember the bears.
I tell this story not to deliver an inspiring message about fighting back, nor to advise you, somewhat less inspiringly, to play dead. I imagine that you will be quite capable of distinguishing between the black bear and grizzly bear situations that come your way in life. No, I tell this story in praise of the unexpected, the informal, and the random knowledge one encounters in an undergraduate experience.
Twenty-five years later, faced with daunting 90-minute afternoon sessions teaching a class in the Science Center, I introduced my own lecture breaks. I delve into Harvard’s rich sporting past and the history of its cricket team. I speak of my experiences of 9/11 and how they found echoes in the days following the marathon bombings. I talk about great Cambridge mathematicians (“wranglers”), like Stokes and Maxwell, whose work created the applied math canon. I share Cadbury’s Dairy Milk and explore Salman Rushdie’s early career, writing commercials for chocolate bars. I reveal who really invented Bayes Theorem. I listen to David Willcocks conducting “Zadok the Priest.” And I uncover the connection between John Milton, Charles Darwin and Borat (all members of Christ College at Cambridge). I talk about random facts, memories and experiences.
As you process through the Yard today, amongst the applause, the speeches, the choirs, and the pounding of the Middlesex Sheriff’s staff, you will hear another sound: the clank of knowledge falling from you. P-sets are complete, finals taken, essays written—and we faculty all appreciate that you will start, happily, to shed chunks of what you learned in formal instruction at Harvard in the lecture hall, laboratory, and library.
But we are equally sure that you will retain into the future much from your informal Harvard experience: late night conversations with friends; unexpected interactions with professors; moments of self-discovery; surprising insights; random knowledge. 
You leave Harvard supremely proficient in a variety of disciplines. Many congratulations on your achievements and your scholarship; it has been an unqualified pleasure to play even a small part in your Harvard education. 
But do not be surprised if what stays with you in the years ahead is the random stuff. Just like the bears.

Twenty years ago, as a member of the Harvard Class of 1994, I left Massachusetts and returned to my native Kentucky to start my next great adventure. In a few weeks, after finishing up my stint as director of the Institute of Politics at Harvard, I will once again leave Massachusetts and return to my Kentucky to start my next great adventure—this time, as president of the Northern Kentucky Chamber of Commerce.
When I left campus in 1994, I didn’t have a plan to run for office, but I definitely had a plan to get involved as a political and community volunteer to make Kentucky a better place to live and work. The only certainty was that I would obtain a joint JD/MBA degree from the University of Kentucky and then take it from there. 
No one who knew me from my involvement with the IOP during my college days was surprised when I ran for Kentucky Secretary of State in 2003. For it was the spark from my time at the IOP—and its dozens of forums, fellow-led study groups, and other events that I attended over those four years—that convinced me that political participation was truly a noble calling. It was also at the IOP—with its bipartisan approach to politics—that I developed a style of working across party lines for a common goal that continues to serve me well.
Unfortunately, for most members of the millennial generation, which includes almost all of those receiving diplomas today from the College, politics is not viewed so favorably. According to the IOP’s most recent survey of 18- to 29-year-old Americans, while 70 percent say community service is an honorable thing to do, only 32 percent say the same about running for office. This is not a surprise when 62 percent of those surveyed say that elected officials are motivated by selfish reasons and 58 percent say elected officials don’t share their priorities. 
Clearly we have a lot of work to do, and for the past three-and-a-half years, as the IOP director, I have worked hard to encourage more students to consider careers in politics and public service—the IOP’s primary mission.
This mission is more important than ever before, given the broken state of our politics and the challenges that our country and world face. Fortunately, for those who find this a challenge worth tackling, there are plenty of opportunities for young people to volunteer and make a difference or even run for office at a young age. 
Right now for example, former IOP student leaders are running for governor in both Massachusetts (Juliette N. Kayyem ’91) and Maryland (Anthony G. Brown ’84), running for congress in New York (Elise M. Stefanik ’06), and running for the state senate in Massachusetts (Eric Lesser ’07). 
I can personally testify to this. I worked my way up—first as a volunteer, then taking on leadership positions—always putting in the necessary sweat equity to help my candidates win. This put me in the position to start my campaign for secretary of state at age 30, the youngest in the country at the time of my election. I am proud of what I accomplished in that office and am proud of my time here at Harvard.
I want to encourage this year’s graduates to consider stepping up and entering the arena like Juliette, Anthony, Elise, Eric, or me. Or if being the candidate isn’t for you, find someone who you can support with your time and your money. Campaigns are staffed and managed by young people, and are often best fueled by young volunteers.
Perhaps it is fitting as the director of a living memorial to President John F. Kennedy ’40 to conclude with Kennedy’s 1963 remarks to an audience at Vanderbilt University: “The educated citizen has an obligation to serve the public. He may be a precinct worker or a president. He may give his talents at the courthouse, the state house, the White House. He may be a civil servant or a senator, a candidate or a campaign worker, a winner or a loser. But he must be a participant and not a spectator.”
It’s time for all of us to be participants and not spectators. The stakes are too high.

Trey Grayson ’94, former Kentucky Secretary of State, is the director of Harvard's Institute of Politics. In July, he will begin service as president of the Northern Kentucky Chamber of Commerce.

With professors who study computer science, economics, history, and statistics, the Harvard Law School faculty of today touts a wide array of academics, many of whom boast Ph.D.s or scholarly work in other subjects. Yet this was not always the case.
“Somebody who got into a top law school, did very well and then completed a prestigious clerkship was well situated to be hired on the basis of those credentials,” said Law School professor Richard H. Fallon, who attended Yale Law School and clerked for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell.
Now, however, the Law School looks for a greater breadth of academic qualifications in its prospective faculty, including “demonstrated scholarly accomplishment, a promising research agenda offering both relevance to legal analysis or law practice, and an ability to present and effectively defend a thesis or argument before faculty members,” according to Law School Dean Martha L. Minow.
As the expectations for aspiring law professors have changed, faculty and administrators say, so has the tenor and complexity of today’s legal scholarship, sparking a continuing debate on the merits and drawbacks of new approaches that incorporate other academic fields into legal training.
CHANGING EXPECTATIONS
In 1963, Charles Nesson had just graduated summa cum laude from Harvard Law School and was headed for a clerkship with Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan.
“I received a call from the dean asking if I wanted to come teach,” Nesson said. “I didn’t apply. I said yes, and that was it.”
After clerking for Justice Harlan and working for the Department of Justice, Nesson joined the faculty in 1966 and has remained on Harvard Law School’s campus ever since.
But the days when of top students, such as Nesson, could expect job offers right after graduation seem to have passed. Today, the road to professorship has fractured into many, lesser-travelled pathways, most of which require significant scholarship beyond the attainment of a law degree.
If a student approached him about becoming a professor,  Fallon said, “the thing that I would start to talk to the person about is how the person would get himself or herself into a position in which it was possible to produce significant legal scholarship before going on the job market.”
“I think what’s really changed is the demand for published writing,” he said.
As new scholars are added to the faculty today, they are expected to write prolifically, and many of them already have for their dissertations.
“You have to think about the fact that the main job for a law professor is to write,” said Law School professor William B. Rubenstein. “You have to enjoy the process and think of yourself as writing term papers for the rest of your life. They kind of see us in the classroom and are less familiar with the scholarship.”
Many prospective law professors earn their scholarly credentials in Ph.D. programs, Law School professor James Greiner said, noting that the three years of law school do not provide enough time to teach students how to complete serious research.
“If we're going to require that everyone have two or three published papers before they apply for an entry-level job at a national law school, we are essentially requiring them to do a Ph.D.,” Greiner said.
Those who earn Ph.D.s typically do so before completing their law degree or in a joint program, according to Greiner.
Greiner himself, however, followed a different approach, earning his law degree, practicing in the field for six years, and subsequently pursuing a Ph.D. in statistics, which he now incorporates into his classes.
CHANGING APPROACHES
As the Law School faculty expanded to include a wider variety of backgrounds, professors began to study the law in new ways, often using empirical evidence and other fields of study as a lens to examine the law.
“In the last 20 or so years, legal scholarship has increasingly turned to tools from other disciplines, including economics, history, literature, political science, psychology, and statistics,” Law School Dean Martha L. Minow wrote in an email. “This change has brought great range and depth to legal scholarship.”
As a result, the ways in which professors think about legal scholarship have also also changed, according to Greiner.
“What law school professors mostly did, what they thought of themselves as doing, was analyzing legal doctrine,” Greiner said. “Modern tenured and tenure track law professors...bring their methodology that they learned about in their Ph.D. and they analyze law with the Ph.D. principles,” Greiner said.
Yet this change comes with both benefits and drawbacks, he said.
“It leads to an extraordinarily diverse faculty that can deploy lots of different ideas when we come together, but we come together less frequently. It leads to less of an integrated experience for the students, but a broader experience for the students.” Greiner said. “It's harder for me to read my colleague's work now because they are deploying lessons in economics for instance and I've never taken an economics course in my life.”
Greiner said this trend is representative of a larger movement away from the “nuts and bolts of practice.”
“We focus less on stuffing our students heads completely full with what the doctrine in different areas of law looks like,” Greiner said, noting that the Law School teaches less legal writing than in the past.
CHANGING LAWYERS?
When brought into the classroom, some professors find these new frameworks to be impractical and overly abstract. But others counter that interdisciplinary approaches enhance legal training by helping students view the law in a broader context.
For Nesson, some of the empirical approaches of today’s law professors are often  “just boring” and “irrelevant.”
“Now they argue from data and think that this is going to be interesting,” said Nesson. “You go to a workshop where someone is delivering a paper, and you wonder, why would you spend your time working at this level of detail on this topic and who can you get to listen to it...It tends to lose me.”
Others fear that the influence of Ph.Ds has made classes less practical, shifting the law school’s education away from its primary goal of professional training.
“We can’t turn law schools into graduate school for the study of law,” Law School professor David B. Wilkins ’77 said. “Most of the people who graduate from law school are going to be lawyers, or at least practice law for a period of time, and therefore we need professors who understand that dimension as well.”
Despite this fear, Wilkins credited the shift with bringing a more robust, interdisciplinary approach to legal problems.
“I think this has been a very important and very good trend in many ways if we think that legal problems aren’t just independently legal problems but are connected to economic efficiency or political institutions and how they operate our culture,” he said. “If that’s right, then we do need people who have the training to think critically about these issues.”
For Alan M. Dershowitz, who taught at the Law School for 50 years before retiring last December,  both types of professors are necessary to give students the best possible experience.
“We have to have a balance of people who can teach future lawyers to do what they will be doing as well as philosophers and people with academic backgrounds,” he said. “I think the best teachers are those who have both practical experience and a good base in theory, but I think we need to strike a balance between the Ph.D.s and the practitioners.”
To focus on the practical aspects of law, Dershowitz himself refrained from using hypothetical examples in his own classrooms, instead electing to only use real cases.
“In my own life, I’ve tried to bring my theory into the courtroom and my practice into the classroom, and that’s a combination that’s necessary at the Law School,” said Dershowitz, who defended a number of high profile cases during his career, including the murder trial of football star O.J. Simpson.
As law schools continue to search for this balance, they must remain true to their mission of preparing students to practice law, Dershowitz said.
“We are after all a professional school, and we perform a service to the profession and to the country by turning out superb lawyers, and superb lawyers have to be able to integrate theory and practice,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
When Sheila S. Jasanoff ’64 entered Radcliffe College in 1960, she defied the image of a typical “Radcliffe girl.”
 
For one, she was over two years younger than most of the other freshmen, after being placed ahead of her age’s grade level when her family moved from Mumbai to suburban New York four years earlier. Jasanoff concentrated in mathematics, which was a choice Amy M. Cohen-Corwin ’64, her college friend and fellow mathematics concentrator, described as “extremely uncommon” for students at Radcliffe.


She was also one of the few South Asian students on campus at the time. “Most of the people we met had never met an Indian before,” Jasanoff recalled. “It was not a particularly diverse student body at the time.”
These atypical traits and choices during her time at Radcliffe foreshadowed her varied and trailblazing academic career.
 
After concentrating in mathematics as an undergraduate, Jasanoff completed her M.A. and Ph.D. in linguistics. She then received a J.D. from Harvard Law School, after which she focused on environmental law. Then, Jasanoff settled into her present field of Science and Technology Studies, which she helped pioneer. In 1998, she returned to Harvard, a place Jasanoff said she and her family have always been particularly attached to. She is currently a professor of Science and Technology Studies at the Harvard Kennedy School.
 
Although Jasanoff said that her career trajectory has been propelled by the “accidental convergence” of opportunities, her friends and family credit her personal and professional success to her kind, pragmatic personality and her creative, adaptive mind.
MAKING AN IMPRESSION
 While at Radcliffe, Jasanoff made a strong impression. Edith D. Sylla ’63, who Jasanoff said was her closest friend in college, recalled that Jasanoff was very thoughtful, practical, and talented.
Though Jasanoff described Radcliffe as an “intimidating experience,” Sylla said, “I didn’t perceive Sheila as being more insecure than other people. I would have said she was very grounded.”


Once, at a conference in 1985, Jasanoff was approached by a stranger who told her that his sister-in-law had attended Radcliffe with her; he asked if she knew how impressive she had appeared in college.
“I thought to myself, ‘Ridiculous!’” Jasanoff said. “I was going around thinking how impressive everybody else was.”
A CAREER OF CHANGE
According to Jasanoff, her father, who worked for the UN, intended for her to return to India after she completed her education. Those original plans changed when Jasanoff was completing her M.A. at the University of Bonn in what was then West Germany.
While in West Germany, she changed her field of study to linguistics, a decision that she said led to her father cutting her off. It was also in Bonn that she met her future husband Jay H. Jasanoff ’63, a professor of linguistics at Harvard. Though their college years had overlapped, the two had not met at Harvard.
 
Jasanoff returned to Harvard twice afterwards, first for a Ph.D. in linguistics from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and then for a J.D. from the Law School.
“Harvard is woven into the fabric of our family in a very engaging way,” Jasanoff said. “This the place where [my husband and I] both grew up, got married, had kids.” Jasanoff’s husband and daughter are both professors at the College, and many members of her immediate family attended the College.
She added that asking why she chose to return to Harvard several times is akin to asking, “Why did you decide to come home?”
Jasanoff practiced environmental law in Boston from 1976 to 1978 until she and Jay Jasanoff accepted job offers at Cornell University.
PIONEERING A FIELD
 She said that it was at Cornell that her career in Science and Technology Studies began. STS is an interdisciplinary field that explores how scientific discoveries and technological advances impact social structures like law, public policy, and ethics.
“Back then, the field didn’t exist. The field gradually came into being in the 70s and onwards, and it didn’t crystallize until the 80s and 90s,” Sheila Jasanoff said. “It was a cluster of researchers who had interests in this field, but they weren’t trained in it.”
As the founding chair of the STS department at Cornell, Jasanoff greatly contributed to the establishment of the field. The field of STS has blossomed since its founding, with popular programs at schools like Cornell, MIT, and Stanford. Since 2002, Jasanoff has taught and conducted research in the STS program at the Kennedy School.
Jasanoff’s daughter Maya R. Jasanoff ‘96, a history professor at Harvard, called her mother a “very creative and field-defining scholar.”
 
“I have learned from her how to look above and beyond the established conventional categories that academia might be cut into,” Maya Jasanoff said. “She thinks very creatively about how to link ideas together.”
Cohen-Corwin said she was unsurprised by Jasanoff’s career path. 
 
“I’m never surprised by the careers bright, serious people develop,” Cohen-Corwin said, recalling their diverse conversation topics and what she described as Jasanoff’s “great balance” between being both engaged and rational about the issues of the day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the first day that she taught a section at Harvard, Margaret Doherty walked into a Robinson Hall classroom only to realize there were more students than chairs.
“I spent the first 15 minutes of that very first section carting chairs from one classroom in Robinson to the other,” Doherty, an English Department teaching fellow, recalls.
That semester, she was teaching two sections of an English lecture course. Each section included about 18 students, a number that she says caused unexpected problems as she found herself sitting in her office for five extra hours of individual meetings with students each day the week before a paper was due.
“That was really challenging, and I don’t think I gave students the right amount of attention that first semester,” she says.
Concerned that large sections like these might diminish the quality of the undergraduate experience and hinder their ability to train as professors, a group of teaching fellows united this spring to demand that the University restrict sections to 12 students.
Though the Harvard Teaching Campaign has drawn support from various departments and faculty members, the self-described “grassroots” coalition has yet to reach out to University administrators, who say that the universal section cap is neither needed nor practicable.
CAMPAIGN FOR A CAP
Citing pedagogical research and personal anecdotes, Campaign members contend that smaller section sizes can benefit both students and teaching fellows.
According to Doherty, pedagogical research suggests that class discussions involving more than 14 students are not as effective as those with fewer members.
“We thought that if 14 is the maximum, why not have it slightly below the maximum?” Doherty says of the campaign’s ambition for a 12-student section cap.
The section cap would replace the current size goal, which, according to Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, is 18 students for most lecture courses; though that number “varies depending on the type of course,” he said in February.
Doherty says that in her seven years as a graduate student, she has seen section sizes increase from eight to 12 students each up to 18 to 22, a rise that she says has decreased student engagement in sections.
History professor Daniel L. Smail, who supports the Campaign, dates the growth back to the 2008 financial crisis, which he says caused the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to cut back on teaching fellows.
Doherty argues that larger sections have not only undermined undergraduate instruction but also made it harder for graduate students to learn how to teach, a skill which the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences policy on teaching appointments—the comprehensive set of policies on teaching fellows—calls “an integral part of professional training.”
Larger sections also increase the burden of administrative tasks such as sending emails, hosting office hours, and grading work, says Cristina V. Groeger, a History Department Ph.D. candidate.
“[Teaching fellows] cannot devote the same amount of personal attention to each student” as they could if they taught smaller sections, Groeger writes in an email.
SIGNATURES AND ENDORSEMENTS
In light of their grievances, Campaign members have urged members of the Harvard community—from undergraduates to faculty members and alumni—to sign a petition calling for smaller sections. In the past semester, the petition has amassed over 1,000 signatures, according to Groeger.
The group has received support for their mission from a number of faculty members, including collective endorsements from the Philosophy and Sociology departments. In a statement, Philosophy faculty members wrote that graduate programs serve to train the “next generation” of professors and called for “better working conditions” for teaching fellows.
In addition, more than 90 percent of the History Department signed a letter of support to various administrators, including Harris and FAS Dean Michael D. Smith.
Yet the group has yet to reach out to administrators, as they hope to build a “critical mass” of support from a more diverse range of departments, according to Michael A. Thornton, a teaching fellow for the Program in General Education and the History and East Asian Languages and Civilizations departments.
He and others have stated that the Campaign does not have any official leadership, and, as a result, that they could not speak about the group’s plans for future dialogue with administrators.
CONCERNS FROM THE TOP
Although they have yet to be approached by Campaign members, administrators say that they have concerns about both the rationale of the group’s demands and the feasibility of reducing section sizes.
One critique is that a section cap would be an inappropriate solution to issues that do not have a one-size-fits-all answer.
“I can imagine that for some courses, a very, very small section size, like maybe fewer than ten, would be appropriate. In other cases, it could be many more,” University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 says. “We should think about section size as being dictated by the needs of the specific course.”
In a letter to the editor published in The Crimson in March, Sociology professor Christopher Winship called the Campaign’s demand “off the mark,” arguing that sections without required attendance can be effective even with more students. Winship is a key figure within the FAS governance structure as vice chair of the committee that sets agendas for monthly Faculty meetings.
In response to these critiques, campaign member and chemistry Ph.D. student John M. Nicoludis says that he wants to fight the perception that courses in certain subjects do not need small sections to facilitate an ideal learning environment.
“[Sections] are all meant to be participatory, discussion-based learning environments,” he said.
But even if a 12-person cap would improve the classroom experience across the board, University leaders say that the policy could create a supply-and-demand problem.
“Reducing the size of every section offered across our curriculum would instantly provide a greater number of teaching opportunities but risks creating more sections than we have qualified teachers," Smith writes in an email.
The focus, Garber says, should be on making sure that section leaders are well-qualified.
With a lack of qualified individuals to fill teaching fellow positions, graduate students might be assigned to teach outside of their areas of expertise to staff the new sections created to accommodate the section limit, Winship and others argue. If departments must hire teaching fellows from other schools in the University or even outside of Harvard, they may lack any preparation for teaching and may not have attended the trainings conducted by some departments. 
 
Another issue, Garber argues, is the College’s current course shopping system.
“You can't at the outset know exactly how many students that you will have,” Garber says. “Therefore, you can't always perfectly anticipate how many teaching fellows you will need.”
While he says that he supports the movement, professor Nicholas J. Watson, interim chair of the English department, wrote in an email that he does not know “if there’s too much the [College] can do to manage section sizes while it remains unclear if 40 or 400 people will sign up for a given course.”
Doherty and other Campaign members have said that they would compromise with administrators about the section cap for certain courses.
“Whether or not that number is 12 across the board, I think that’s something we’re open to discussing,” says Doherty. “If there’s a compelling reason that 14 is fine in a section for a science course, then okay.”
But without outreach to administrators, negotiations and other discussions about the limit have yet to take place.
“Right now, I don’t really have a timeline, and the group as a whole doesn’t really have a timeline for when this would actually happen,” says Thornton.
Instead, members of the Campaign hope to attract support from other segments of the University community, from undergraduate and graduate students and their parents to faculty members and alumni.
“Once that happens, I think it will sort of unfold from there,” Thornton says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Harvard’s current large-scale fundraising drive is not nearly the first such venture in the University’s 377-year history. During his tenure as Harvard president from 1991 to 2001, English professor Neil L. Rudenstine led Harvard’s last capital campaign, and the first that stretched across nearly all of the University’s disparate schools.
As The Harvard Campaign progresses through its public phase’s first year, Rudenstine spoke with The Crimson about the experiences and lessons learned during Harvard’s last drive, both from the perspective of a fundraising president and of an institution trying to prepare itself financially for a new millenium. The interview has been edited for clarity and concision.
The Harvard Crimson: I know that you led a really large capital campaign when you were here as president, and I’m curious as to how much of your time you devoted to the campaign and to talking with donors and traveling.
Neil L. Rudenstine: Well, I think one would have to say that it’s irregular: that is, there are times when it’s very intense and one might be giving as much as two-thirds of one’s time to the campaign at crucial moments. At other times, much less intense, and so it might shrink down to a quarter time or something like that. And I had...my own rule that it should never go beyond 30 or 40 percent of my time, no matter how important it was, as an average. There were just too many other academic and other things to attend to that had obvious, very high priority. And while the campaign was an immense priority as well, one just had to ration what one did.
THC: Speaking to that, when you were working on the campaign speaking to donors, how did you decide what to prioritize, and when the campaign would take priority?
NLR: It wasn’t so rational a decision in the sense that one could sort of sit back and say, ‘Well this week I’ll do this, and then two weeks later, I’ll do that.’ Doing a campaign involved an enormous amount of logistical and other kinds of work. And it depends as much upon other people and their timing as it does upon one’s own. So, you simply have to be careful not to get too much on the docket so to speak in advance…. For example, we went to the far east and visited Hong Kong and mainland China, [Korea], and Japan and Taiwan. And that probably took the better part of a year to plan, and once one got everything lined up, one was simply committed to it. And so, as I said, its a two-way street in the sense that you try to do as much as you can to shape it, but at the same time it depends an enormous amount on the schedules...of other people.
THC: Speaking to traveling internationally, as well as I’m sure domestically, when you were going to a new city or a new country, how did you spend your days on the road? What was it like when you were in a new city and speaking to donors? What did your schedules look like?
NLR: Well, you weren’t only speaking with donors, of course. We tried very hard to make sure that there was a mix of people. Donors, obviously, are the largest part of it. But when we went to Japan, for example, we met with the prime minister and some members from the government. Then, the next day we had an audience [with] the Emperor and Empress and then the Crown Prince and Crown Princess…. So, the schedule was definitely not simply a donor-driven schedule.
We spent, I guess, a whole afternoon at a place called Katsura, which is the royal imperial families’ beautifully maintained gardens. And we also went to see some neat gardens somewhere else. So, if you don’t sort of try to immerse yourself to some extent in the culture as a whole to meet lots of different kinds of people, then you don’t learn anything much; and they don’t necessarily learn anything much. Part of the mission is to have a chance to discuss important issues or less important issues with all kinds of people. And as I said, one obviously spends a fair amount of time talking to donors as well. But I would say that probably no more than half the time was devoted to donors, and a good deal of time to these other kinds of activities.
THC: Did you similarly spend about half the time, no more than that, talking to donors when you were traveling domestically as well?
NLR: Well, as I said, there were times when it was more than that depending on schedules and there were times when it was less than that. And I tried to keep it, as I said, sort of in the 40 percent range throughout the campaign or less because I wanted to make sure things on campus were properly attended to. And there were a lot of things going on educationally..., that simply had to take a high priority.
THC: Speaking to your responsibilities on campus and Cambridge and Mass. Hall, considering your kind of involvement in the campaign, compared to a non-campaign year, did you manage or delegate responsibilities any differently in a campaign year than you would have in a non-campaign year?
NLR: Well, to be honest, there weren't that many non-campaign years. I guess [in] the first three years, we were not in a public campaign, but we were already laying groundwork for the campaign and already talking quietly to donors because in order to make the kind of target we had set out for ourselves, we had to have raised a very substantial of money at the time we announced publicly what the campaign would be. So I arrived in 1991, and it wasn’t really long after that we began actively planning for the campaign because the campaign was going to last five years and the planning took at least two to three years. And I was there for a decade and my last year, of course, was a rather different kind of year. So I wouldn't say that there was a whole lot. One of the things I did do, though, very early on, was to create the position of provost. We had a rather small group of both associate provosts and myself in Massachusetts Hall, plus the five vice presidents. But that huge difference because provost did not evenly split a good number of days either on the road or at home.
THC: Speaking to your role going and traveling and doing these various things on the road, but also talking with alumni and donors, I’m curious as to what you saw as your role as University President as doing on the road? Of course, I’m sure there are others with you and the development office also played a role.  What did you think that you could communicate to people that you met, either abroad, or in other cities, about the University’s priorities or these different issues? What did you bring to the campaign personally by being there?
NLR: Well, I think the most important thing you can do [in] a campaign is to be clear about what the University's most important needs are and their priorities…. In effect, the agenda, the case, [is] truly the driving force, there’s no point in having a campaign unless you have exceptional things that you feel are very important to be able to advance the mission of the University in educational terms. And so, in effect, knowing from the bottom up, so to speak, what it was the institution needed, and why.… And I found on the whole, that my asking people was very, very limited, and I much preferred to talk to people about what the needs were, and what the upside in terms of what one could achieve educationally was. And that was far more important, as well as more enjoyable. And that if people were persuaded, then they were likely to give. That was the premise.
THC: What are your thoughts on having that One Harvard messaging in the way that [President Faust] talks to donors, and I have heard speak to at events. Do you think that that kind of messaging and emphasizing that kind of vision is helpful in trying to really truly have a University-wide campaign with initiatives across schools?
NLR: It’s also the case that from the point of view of motivating people, for whatever reason, they do respond to the idea—they think of themselves as “Harvard.” They don’t think of themselves as just School of Public Health graduates, or art department graduates, or whatever the case may be. They think of themselves that way, too. But the name Harvard is the vision of a single place that they are somehow connected to. And we found that people were motivated much more strongly, much more generously in their giving when they rose to the idea that it was really [the] University as a whole that made sense.…
And so it’s not a phrase as it were, or as you said a message. It’s really a reality that has to be brought into being. If you are working on environmental problems, there is no point working on them if you can't involve people from the Medical school or the School of Public Health, especially, people from law who know about law having to do with the environment, people from the Business School who know something about how businesses are going to to be affected by changes in regulation and so on and so forth. People in arts and sciences, and the certainly biological sciences, as well as other places.... It’s not just a message or an abstract vision, it’s an educational and research reality.
THC: Do you have any more thoughts either on the One Harvard idea, or on anything else you would like to add about your experiences traveling or being on the road on the campaign?
NLR: Well, I think that, I don't question that the experience of traveling on the road was tremendously important. It may seem to some people to take the president or other people away from the University, which in one sense it obviously does for a reasonable amount of time. At the same time, there is simply no way to...learn about what people think is important in the University, educational process of the president and other people. And there’s no way to communicate what the University means, and what it’s doing, and what it can achieve without actually having group sessions, without meeting with individuals, without having large, alumni gatherings where you can give talks and so on.
It is as much an educational process as it is a financial process. And because people are not going to give back [simply] because it’s Harvard. They are going to give because they believe that something that is excellent can be made more excellent. And in order for them to do that, they have to understand what it is, what's the educational mission here, what’s the research here, what are we giving to and why.
So, its very important to stress that part of it. [There are] people who feel that campaigns are just “fundraising” and that fundraising is some kind of a mechanical process where you go and ask people for money and they give it. It’s totally different from that. It’s a human process and an educational process, which obviously involves a financial dimension that is extremely important. But the financial dimension, which simply shrinks in terms of its significance without the other part….
I guess I would add one thing. I've been up to Harvard a few times and I’ve heard a fair amount [about] what is being planned in the campaign and so on. And I think that President Faust and her colleagues are just doing an extraordinarily excellent job. And so I can’t praise them enough. And so I hope the whole University, including the students, will get behind it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Early on a chilly Saturday morning in April 2013, a group of Harvard’s most elite donors gathered in the Business School’s Spangler Center. After breakfast in Spangler’s sunlit Williams Room, the attendees were treated to a day of Harvard celebrity: an hour of conversation with University President Drew G. Faust, a panel moderated by Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, and discussions throughout the day with some of the University’s most celebrated professors.
The annual symposium of the Committee on University Resources—or COUR, as it is known by its members—is an invitation-only event, and only the University’s most valued donors are on the list. COUR, like the alumni council of advisors convened by Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith or other alumni visiting committees at various schools, is both a reward for past support and an engagement tool meant to bring top alumni to campus and into conversation with the University’s top leadership.
Taken together, the committees form a crucial part of the powerful fundraising machine built by Harvard’s Office of Alumni Affairs and Development, which is operating at full horsepower during the University’s ongoing capital campaign. But while COUR and other committees like it unite hundreds of well-heeled donors, for most Harvard supporters life after graduation does not begin on a top committee with the ear of Smith, Garber, or Faust.
There are many different types of donors and many different paths to giving, and the Development Office’s robust fundraising network aims to cull them all. For many supporters, the process runs through events, reunions, and other gatherings planned by University staff and eventually culminates in a gift of $10,000 or less each year.
But for those who give more—often much more—the relationship is far more intimate, with access and attention ratcheted up. When big gifts are on the table, Harvard’s Development Office antes up, making available top professors and leadership and giving big donors a chance to craft just how their money is spent.
BEHIND THE CURTAIN
With an ambitious University-wide capital campaign in full swing, one of Harvard’s most important arms is in a fairly nondescript office building at 124 Mt. Auburn Street. Inside, staffers at Alumni Affairs and Development operate the behind-the-scenes machinery of Harvard’s famed fundraising apparatus. University Vice President Tamara E. Rogers ’74 runs the show from two offices: one inside the Development Office and another with the central administration in Massachusetts Hall.
“Our alumni don’t owe us philanthropy,” Rogers explains late on a Monday afternoon this May, outlining the overarching mission of her office. “What we want to do is to make them feel as though, given that they’re philanthropic, that Harvard is a place where they would want to be philanthropic.”
But before Rogers and her staff make the pitch to potential supporters, officers at Alumni Affairs and Development work with a robust in-house research team to study Harvard alumni—and even some potential targets with no affiliation to Harvard—who might be interested in donating, as well as trends in finance and philanthropy.
The research usually amounts to an extensive collection of publicly available information, Rogers says, ranging from the academic field of the relevant graduate to other philanthropy the target might be involved in, to corporate board postings, and much more. A particular focus of the research team is previous work with nonprofits and giving to higher education.
“There is an astonishing amount, of course, that one can learn from public sources about potential interests of prospective donors, be they alumni or non-alumni,” Rogers says. She adds that her best source of information is often the groups of volunteers her office organizes around the world. After volunteers interact with potential targets, Rogers says, they often report back to the central fundraising office on the target’s overall interest and any specific programs that might seem attractive.
“People, when they come together to talk about fundraising [might say], ‘I think you might approach this person for this and that person for that,’” she explains. “[Volunteers] may know more than we do.”
For those who think that development amounts to a few mailings and a lot of phone calls, Rogers, with a laugh, insists, “it’s not quite that simple.”
Indeed, after the research is done, more than 200 frontline gift officers—some working from the Development office itself, the others working at individual schools—bring the results into the field. Hundreds more work in support as assistants, analysts, and event and financial planners across the University.
According to various online job postings by the University, new gift officers are expected to commit a large part of their year—up to two months—to life on the road, where they meet potential and existing donors on their home turf. Annually, these officers are expected to conduct hundreds of in-person meetings with alumni and are also required to continually generate new leads of potential donors in the $100,000 plus range.
‘A WHO’S WHO OF HARVARD’
Those who establish a pattern of significant giving are likely to hear more from the Development Office and, in some cases, Harvard’s leaders, as they gain eligibility for an important perk of sustained support: the alumni committee.
“Once you give serious money, they will never let go of you,” Byron R. Wien ’54 says.
Major donors like Wien fill out formal and informal committees spread across the University’s schools and run by top administrators. The committees have various functions, but nearly all have a similar, overarching goal: keep alumni on campus and in touch with Harvard.
Keeping alumni engaged, Rogers says, “means ensuring that they meet people who could be of interest [and] revisit the campus.” Depending on the donor, these visits often include facetime with top University officials. “It’s quite, quite common that they have the opportunity to spend time with various leadership,” she says, adding later that for the donor who wants to stay abreast of what is going on at Harvard, committee work is often very attractive.
“There are people who are very interested in committees, they are interested in helping the University solve certain kinds of problems or look at certain issues,” she says.
Among the most exclusive of these groups is the Committee on University Resources, founded by the Board of Overseers in 1940 and envisioned by University officials and COUR members as a capstone recognizing generous support to Harvard. While wealthy alumni often serve on various visiting committees or deans’ councils, many of the wealthiest are united by COUR membership.
Some members say they did not even know COUR existed before they were invited to join, but most insist that admission to the committee does not necessarily come with the expectation of future support. Once invited, members say that COUR becomes a place where a group of dedicated supporters can connect with one another and with top Harvard officials in an intimate setting.
“I was just amazed at the individuals who were invited to participate in it and what they had accomplished in their lives,” says Paul J. Zofnass ’69. “In my view, it was the who’s who of Harvard.”
Zofnass adds that while he had given generously to Harvard before being invited to join COUR, he “wasn’t even close” to the $1 million figure that some have claimed is a membership requirement for COUR.
Most COUR members interviewed for this story say that the highlights of the group’s annual meetings are the enhanced access to University leadership and the discussions with other members.
“You broaden your knowledge about the University and its needs, and there's a certain camaraderie that develops. Everybody has a similar mission,” says Kenneth Lipper, a graduate of the Law School and a member of COUR. “It gives you a chance to have a dialogue with the president and various officers of the University.”
According to Zofnass, the common ground established by COUR membership quickly forges relationships.
“If you go to one of these annual events, you meet somebody for the first time, and a year later, they’re like old friends even though you probably only knew them for 10 minutes,” he says.
Each COUR annual meeting comes with a guiding theme: in April 2013, the gathering focused on innovation and the sciences and ended with a tour of laboratory spaces that many COUR members had helped to fund. Despite the insistence that COUR membership does not represent a forward-looking quid-pro-quo, members say that this programming, coupled with the access to Harvard’s leadership that COUR provides, can lead to more giving.
Mitchell L. Dong ’75 says he discovered an interest in public health and environmental policy while he was a freshman at the College, but his decision to support the School of Public Health came after a presentation by the school’s then-dean, Harvey V. Fineberg ’69 at a COUR meeting.
“I got friendly with Harvey and he invited me to join the [School of Public Health] visiting committee,” Dong remembers. “I just kind of gradually got sucked in.” 
When Dong’s 25th reunion came around, he and his wife, Robin, worked with Fineberg, then the provost, to make a major gift to the School of Public Health to endow a professorship.
THE BIG ASK
While donors say that committees are effective tools of engagement, they add that the Development Office often moves beyond the committee and brings in the closers—top University administrators—when it comes time to make a big pitch.


Especially during a capital campaign, officials like Faust, Garber, and the deans and alumni campaign co-chairs of various schools play a crucial role in fundraising. When members of this group travel, the Development Office arranges meetings with potential supporters and ensures that days away from Cambridge are well spent.
“Development would like to fill every waking minute,” Faust says of her schedule when she travels for fundraising purposes. “And they... often succeed if I don’t say, ‘between 3:30-4:00 I’m going to take a nap or go for a walk or call in back to the office and find out what’s going on in Cambridge.’ I just have to say in advance, ‘don’t take that time,’ or they’ll take every minute of it. So they’re extremely effective in that way.”
When it comes time for leadership to sit down with a potential benefactor, the Development Office makes sure that the administrator—who might meet dozens of prospects during a day on the road—is prepared for the crucial one-on-one session. For meetings with new acquaintances, the administrator is usually provided with a concise, bulleted biography of the prospect.
“Ultimately, [the researchers] make sure that our leadership and volunteers have the best information in front of them when they sit down for a meeting,” says Alumni Affairs and Development spokesperson Patrick S. McKiernan.
The preparation is understandable; for many donors, these meetings are a crucial final step in the decision to make a large gift, coming after a long courting process by fundraising officers, group meetings with leaders, and committee work.
For Kenneth C. Griffin ’89, a long-term relationship with University leaders translated this February into a $150 million gift to the University, $125 million of which was designated for undergraduate financial aid.
Griffin served on the FAS’s Financial Aid Task Force before making his record-setting gift. “They are really, really engaged on the task, and its a hard task, to make sure that not just with respect to our country, but with respect to the world, Harvard stays at the forefront of education.”
When New York real estate magnate Peter J. Malkin ’55, another member of COUR, and his wife decided in the early 1980s that they wanted to make a major gift to the University, they immediately approached then-President Neil L. Rudenstine and then-FAS Dean Henry Rosovsky. At the time, the Indoor Athletic Building between Kirkland and Lowell Houses was nearly six decades old and badly in need of attention. Rosovsky presented the project to the Malkins.
“The Dean said that Harvard needed  to renew the Indoor Athletic Building, a crucial facility for the entire community,” Malkin remembers. “It was a project that, when it was presented to us, struck us as something that could really mean a lot to the students, faculty, and staff.”  In 1984, the Malkins celebrated the renovation and renaming of the building as the Malkin Athletic Center.
Like other donors, the Malkins have stayed involved with their project, allowing the University to assume the day-to-day operations and upkeep of the MAC but holding onto the final say when it comes to big decisions. When the MAC came up for renovation in the early 2000s, Malkin consulted architect J. Timothy Anderson ’55 and ultimately revised the University’s proposed changes to the exterior.
Malkin adds that the role of University leadership is crucial when it comes to soliciting philanthropy. “It is the personal touch that the president or the dean provides that really brings those big gifts,” he says. “You're more likely to give if you are called on that way. If the president of Harvard asks you to do something, then you're going to give it a lot more consideration.”
COMING TOGETHER
Though there are many paths to making a donation to Harvard, Faust has emerged during the University’s capital campaign as a uniting force. Though she often meets with donors in small groups, she also travels to generate wide interest in the capital campaign and promote alumni reconnecting with the University.
“I give a lot more speeches,” Faust says of her campaign responsibilities. “Those kind of events mean a more public presentation of the campaign, supporting the different school campaigns, [and] setting the agenda for the larger meetings.”
This May, Faust traveled to New York City where, aboard the decommissioned aircraft carrier Intrepid on the Hudson River, she rallied nearly 600 alumni and donors. In attendance were some of Harvard’s wealthiest benefactors along with some Harvard affiliates who had recently graduated and for whom the registration fee of less than $50 had been waived.
After delivering her standard campaign stump speech, in which she outlines the fund drive’s priorities and speaks of her vision for Harvard’s future, Faust mingled with the crowd in the ship’s hangar, posing for photos and working the room.
“The president is always a big draw,” Rogers says. “Many alumni don’t have the opportunity to hear her speak. By her going around the country, it’s a great chance for people to finally have a chance to see her and hear her and then perhaps meet her at the reception afterwards....some of the students from 2013 and 2010, 2011, and 2012 said, ‘wow, we wanted to come back; we haven’t heard her since our baccalaureate speech.’”
But while Faust is a uniting force, the Development Office is well aware that every potential donor has a different Harvard story and a different interest in supporting the University.
After Faust’s speech and the well-appointed spread at the night’s reception, alumni gradually made for the exits. As they stopped to retrieve their coats, many dwelled over a crimson-clothed table bearing various bowls of pins. In the bowls were symbols of Harvard experiences, ranging from the undergraduate Houses to the University’s graduate schools. As they went their separate ways, some alumni grabbed a few, others just one.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
During his tenure in the early 19th century, University President John T. Kirkland emphasized the independence of each Harvard school, famously saying, “it is our rule here for every tub to stand on its own bottom.” Yet the University’s current capital campaign, which will complete the first year of its public phase this fall, highlights an ongoing shift away from this 200-year-old philosophy as it applies to accruing resources and setting goals for Harvard’s various schools.
Today, the mission of “One Harvard” permeates campaign messaging, washing over centuries of difference. From promotional materials delivered to mailboxes around the world to pitches made to billionaires over cocktails, the notion of University cohesion through inter-school collaboration has dominated official campaign messaging and planning.
Though differences in cultures across schools persist and with them, the redundancies and particularities of a large, decentralized body, the $6.5 billion campaign considered to be Harvard’s first truly University-wide giving push has brought it closer than ever to acting as one University. And as campaign officials have mobilized to unify fundraising efforts and donors have contributed to multiple schools and cross-school initiatives, they have sown the seeds of physical structures and research ventures that have the potential to tie together long-independent pieces of the University for decades to come.
CROSSING OVER 
Stemming from the ambitions of modern University leaders and the demands of a changing global landscape, the desire for increased University cohesion has gained traction across the Harvard community, manifested in the increased promotion and donor support of initiatives that cross school boundaries.
University President Drew G. Faust’s focus on the One Harvard mission, which she has championed since assuming the presidency in 2007, represents a culmination of a vision two decades in the making.
While leading Harvard’s last capital campaign in 1990s, then-University President Neil L. Rudenstine established a $40 million goal for a set of unprecedented inter-school endeavors, including the Mind, Brain, and Behavior research program. The initiatives ultimately failed to attract the donor support Rudenstine had hoped for, though, with the goal still unmet just six months before the end of the $2 billion fundraising effort.
Rudenstine’s successor, Lawrence H. Summers, was somewhat more successful after he moved to Massachusetts Hall in 2001. He galvanized support for cross-disciplinary efforts such as the Stem Cell Institute and pushed for centralization of donor databases across schools, resisting “bureaucratic Darwinism,” a term coined by Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean William C. Kirby to describe inter-school competition for donors.
Summers’s appointee for the position of vice president of alumni affairs and development, Business School chief financial officer Donella M. Rapier, identified increased collaboration as a priority as Harvard prepared for its first truly-University wide campaign. “The plan is...not to say, ‘You get a smaller slice, we get a bigger slice.’ The whole pie expands,” she said in 2003.
When the financial crisis stymied ambitions for the Summers campaign, Faust—a vocal advocate of the One Harvard mission—moved to carry on the dreams of a more unified institution.
Faust replaced Rapier with Tamara E. Rogers ’74, the then-fundraising dean at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, where Faust herself had been dean before her presidency. Within months of her appointment, Rogers assembled a team devoted to fundraising for cross-school programs, and in an interview last spring, she said that her office has focused on increasing coordination to avoid duplication in donor outreach efforts. A web-based application launched by HUIT last fall allows Harvard’s 300 “frontline gift officers” to share notes and contact information for donors and minimize redundant communications.
 
The creation of University-wide priorities such as the Smith Campus Center, campus sustainability, and virtual education also illustrates increased collaboration. Rogers attributes the rise in multi-school efforts to Rudenstine’s campaign, which helped promote ideals of cohesion and collaboration.
Donors have responded positively to these priorities throughout the quiet phase and first year of the campaign, public records show. Gifts have included a combined $250 million donation for the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, a $40 million gift to be allocated for teaching and learning initiatives across the University, and an $80 million contribution for Harvard’s first-ever campus center—a stark contrast to the amounts raised during Rudenstine’s tenure.
Rice University President David W. Leebron ’76 said that the One Harvard mission resonated with him as a donor because he thinks that contemporary global issues call for interdisciplinary collaboration.
“What often sets apart somebody who is quite extraordinary is their ability to...look at problems from more than one perspective,” Leebron said, citing public health and climate change as examples.
“There is continuing and active effort to try and encourage joint gifts to donors who have interests that could be fulfilled by more than one school,” said Sidney R. Knafel ’52, a longtime donor who co-chairs the campaign for the Radcliffe Institute. “That will have a lasting impact on Harvard as an institution.”
LESS OF A TUB, MORE OF A POOL
In addition to funding inter-school initiatives, donors have also displayed support for the One Harvard vision by contributing to campaigns at different schools, regardless of degree affiliation.
According to Faust, alumni increasingly believe that invigorating parts of the University can strengthen Harvard as a whole, with many beginning to identify themselves “as citizens of the whole university, not just their school.”
For example, College and Business School alumni are directing campaigns at schools such as the Graduate School of Education, the Graduate School of Design, and the Divinity School that typically do not have alumni with the same level of financial means.
John K. F. Irving ’83, did not attend the Graduate School of Design but donated $10 million to the school last year and will co-chair its campaign. Irving, who said design has always piqued his interest, said that bolstering individual schools is essential to creating a “great university.”
“Every tub on its own bottom didn’t necessarily get all of the schools to the level that they should be at from a resources, profiling, or even a funding, or strategic point of view,” he said.
Similarly, although he attended the College and Business School, Knafel chairs the $70 million Radcliffe fundraising drive. The campaign is more than halfway to its goal, a fact that Knafel attributes to support from affiliates of other schools, such as FAS and the Business School.
“Radcliffe is dependent on One Harvard,” he said.
Rogers said her office has encouraged University supporters to work for campaigns at these schools—which she says present “a challenge for philanthropy”—to increase donors’  “exposure to the breadth of Harvard” and help them invest in passions that may align with particular schools.
Faust echoed this sentiment, saying that she and Business School Dean Nitin Nohria have discussed the ways in which Business School alumni, who form a relatively rich donor pool, could donate to various other schools.
“If [a donor’s] real passion is education or religion, we’d like to capture that for Harvard rather than have them give a minimal amount to the Business School and nothing more to Harvard at all,” Faust said.
In fact, integration with other parts of Harvard is one of the five priorities of the Business School’s $1 billion campaign.
Robert S. Kaplan, professor and the school’s senior associate dean for external relations, said that potential donors are presented with an overview of initiatives going on at the Business School as well as schools across the University—a technique that has been popular with donors.
“Our participation rate continues to climb because we can offer our alumni philanthropic options that are broader than in the past,” Kaplan said.
Many alumni agree that propping up schools with more limited resources and smaller donor bases can, ultimately, fulfill the One Harvard mission.
“The hope and the opportunity is that the resources you give back benefit any Harvard community member, whether they attend the school you graduated from or a different one,” Peter A. Boyce II ’13 said.
A CONFEDERATION OF CAMPAIGNS
Still, amid unprecedented levels of support of the One Harvard mission, schools have conducted discrete campaigns with priorities and fundraising structures tailored to their needs, a fact that some view as an institutional reality.
The individual school campaigns are “very real” with “their own volunteer structures, leaders, and needs,” Rogers said. In addition to University-wide initiatives and events, each school promotes its own set of priorities and celebratory events.
Some University supporters say that a truly cohesive campaign is impossible given the varying missions and histories of each school. 
 
David L. Yermack ’85, who is also an alumnus of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the Law School and the Business School, identified donor allegiance to particular schools as an obstacle to a unified effort.
“[A completely centralized campaign] would be a radical change in approach from what they’ve been doing for well over a hundred years,” he said. “I’m not sure the message is really going to resonate with alumni...whose identity is really completely connected only to [their] school.”
According to Kaplan, “the power of Harvard” emerges through the integration of schools, even though the specialized priorities and objectives of the schools still necessitate separate campaigns.
Rogers characterized the lack of complete cohesion as a desirable and necessary quality.
“It’s a confederation of school campaigns and also it’s a University campaign. There’s a logic to that. There are genuine, legitimate needs in each school,” Rogers said. “And yet there’s so much more you can imagine if you think of the place whole. It’s hard to imagine only doing one or doing another.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When leaders of the Undergraduate Council led Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister into the Adams House Lower Common Room one Friday in early May, they told him they would be discussing student transportation.
But with balloons, cupcakes, mushrooms, and dozens of undergraduates waiting in the room, it quickly became clear that policy was not up for discussion. While one excited participant instinctively suggested singing happy birthday, there was no confusion as to why the UC had arranged the surprise party: to congratulate and thank Pfister for his work in the last year.
Just a couple of days later, professors and administrators gathered in University Hall for the last full Faculty of Arts and Sciences meeting of the year rose to applaud Pfister, who will step down from the position of dean of the College this summer, after ushering the school through a year of transition.
The scene was markedly different from one that had unfolded in the same room just a year prior, when faculty members at their end-of-year meeting peppered administrators with questions about governance and trust. That meeting proved to be an inflection point in a tumultuous academic year that began with the College’s largest cheating scandal in memory and ended with revelations of secret email searches and, ultimately, the resignation of Evelynn M. Hammonds from the College deanship.
A year after she left office, the strain and strife that roiled the College community under Hammonds has largely been assuaged by her successor, students and administrators say. Improved relations between the Dean’s Office and other parts of the College administration and student body have slowly restored trust, and with it, a sense of productive normalcy.
As the interim year comes to a close and University Hall prepares to welcome its third College dean in just over a year, students, faculty, and administrators say that for all he has accomplished, Pfister has served his role without introducing substantial reforms, setting the stage for incoming dean Rakesh Khurana to chart a more permanent vision for Harvard’s flagship school.
THE SHADOW OF SCANDAL
Pfister moved into his office in early July 2013 and eased into his position at the helm of an administration largely left in disarray.
A breakdown in relations in the spring had led students to question the actions of administrators, some even calling for the then-College dean to resign from her position. At the same time, Faculty members spoke of a loss of trust with FAS and College administrators, who they felt had violated their email privacy policy and infringed upon principles of academic freedom.
All the while, College staff found it difficult to address day-to-day duties, as the administration careened from one scandal to another.
The first had come in late August 2012 in the form of an investigation into about 125 students suspected of improper collaboration on a final take home exam. Even as the University sought to protect the confidentiality of the disciplinary process by declining to reveal the identities of those being investigated, media organizations published confidential information, increasingly worrying administrators about the source of the suspected leaks.
Faced with concerns that the Administrative Board’s confidentiality had been compromised, Hammonds and FAS Dean Michael D. Smith secretly authorized the search of all resident deans’ administrative email accounts.
Come springtime, when those searches came to light, administrators would face a second scandal, one that would permanently sour perceptions of the dean of the College among students and faculty members.
While students and faculty expressed concern over the searches, criticisms of the Dean of the College and the wider administration reached a fever pitch just under a month later, when Hammonds admitted to Faculty members that she had authorized a second round of searches—this time targeting both the administrative and faculty email accounts of a specific resident dean—unbeknownst to Smith.
This violation of existing faculty email privacy policy outraged faculty members and students, as administrators, yet again, faced intense scrutiny. After Hammonds resigned from her post at the end of June, Pfister was appointed to lead the College, left to repair relations with students and staff following a tumultuous year.
THE STUDENT’S DEAN
With the start of the academic year in September, Pfister began sending emails to the student body once every two weeks or so. Filled with College news, short reflections on the seasons, fun facts, and frequently a book recommendation, the messages quickly became hallmarks of his administration, demonstrating to students the accessibility Pfister said he was so interested in promoting.
UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 says that these correspondences, often laced with mushroom and fungi references, revealed a “larger desire on [Pfister’s] part to know what was happening with students and to be a part of it.” So successful were the emails that UC leaders say they looked to Pfister’s example when deciding how they themselves would communicate with the student body.
Indeed, student leaders say Pfister has restored trust and transparency in the College’s top office through constant communication and increased relatability with undergraduates, repairing what UC Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15 calls “frayed relations” believed to be caused in part by the email searches and Gov 1310 cheating scandal.
“Dean Pfister has done a phenomenal job at coming out and really restoring that sense of community, of humility that people like to see in the dean,” Goffard says.
While UC leaders also mention the increased visibility that came as Pfister handed cupcakes to undergraduates during reading period and distributed bookmarks on the Quad shuttle earlier this spring, they emphasized his heightened advocacy for student concerns among FAS administrators.
In their frequent meetings, Mayopoulos says that Pfister was an active supporter for the UC’s initiatives, including proposed funding increases, gender neutral housing, and issues of race at campus brought up by the “I, Too, Am Harvard” campaign. UC leaders say that because Pfister’s deanship was temporary, he was able to be more honest and “relaxed” in discussing the reality of the administration, even when the outcome was not that which students wanted.
“I've never encountered another administrator that was so frank,” Mayopoulos says. “I think in a lot of ways he was very free to talk to with us how he wanted.”
The change in tone and exposure, while seemingly simple to achieve, has significantly shaped the way students look at the position, former UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14 says.
“If this has been a year of pause, an interim year...without any big, long-scale policy, and yet Harvard students feel so much better about him than they did about the previous administration, I think it’s a pretty profound statement about what we value,” Raghuveer says. “And I think what we value is the humanity that he has shown us that we haven’t really seen from a lot of other people.”
TURNING DOWN THE TEMPERATURE
Speaking in his office down the hall from Pfister’s, Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde says that he recalls a tense atmosphere among College staff when he arrived on campus last spring to begin his position as head of the Office of Student Life.
“Everyone was in reaction mode all the time, being constantly bombarded by one controversy after another,” Lassonde says. “That’s a difficult environment to operate in. You don’t feel like you can ever make progress and address student needs and think about and anticipate what those should be.”
But Lassonde says that Pfister was largely successful in maintaining the stability of the College staff coming off a year when administrative cohesion was hard to find. In particular, he says that the “really necessary trust” between the resident deans, who were at the center of the email search scandal, and central College administrators has been restored over the course of Pfister’s tenure, with increased dialogue between the groups and the completion of an FAS review of the resident dean position that reaffirmed the resident deanship’s role in the College.
Pfister says that one of the priorities he set for his year-long tenure was to “build, help, and enhance the College staff,” a task he believes was accomplished by making sure his “door was open” to colleagues and ensuring that they felt their voice was heard in the office.
Russ Porter, the College’s interim dean for administration, praised in an email statement Pfister’s efforts to “strengthen the entire community.”
“Much has been written already this year about his special charm and way with the students, but I want to add that he has that very same impact on the staff here at the College,” Porter wrote.
Adams House resident dean Sharon L. Howell, who was a vocal critic of the handling of the email search scandal, praises the connections she sees Pfister having made among students and administrators.
“It’s been clear that he values resident deans,” Howell says. “This is a moment and has been a moment of transition in a lot of ways, and [Pfister] has been an ideal person to have at the helm in a transitional moment like this because he is calm, and careful, and listens to all of the constituencies.”
Though Pfister says that he did not make specific efforts to reach out to faculty members during his time as dean, members of the Harvard community say that Pfister’s presence itself was restorative for the group.
Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations professor Ali S. Asani ’77 explains that the real rift between faculty members and administrators existed with the FAS Dean’s Office, not that of the College Dean.
“Because he is a respected faculty member who has been at Harvard for a long time, and people know him and he’s been a House master, appointing someone like him actually was seen as a good sign. Okay, here’s somebody that we can trust,” Asani says.
‘PAR FOR THE COURSE’
Despite Pfister’s strides to improve perceptions toward the dean of the College position, students, faculty, and administrators say that they recognize that Pfister’s tenure was a year of pause in policy, one where initiating long-term projects and reforms took a backseat to providing a smooth transitional administration while Smith searched for the next dean of the College.
Pfister facilitated the decision to expand gender neutral housing and saw through the conclusion of the resident dean review, but, when he departs University Hall this summer, he will leave his successor complicated and unsolved questions regarding academic integrity and vacancies among the College staff.
Former Hammonds advisor D. E. Lorraine Sterritt left her position as College dean for administration in the fall, a vacancy that has gone without a permanent replacement throughout Pfister’s tenure. An exodus of staffers at the academic year’s end is expected to include Howell, Secretary of the Ad Board John “Jay” L. Ellison, and Cabot House Resident Dean Emily W. Stokes-Rees, all of whom played a large role in the adjudication of the cheating case through their involvement with the Ad Board.
Khurana will also be faced with implementing the recently approved honor code and creating the student-faculty judicial board charged with hearing academic integrity cases. And other student life issues will remain on the plate for the College’s next top administrator as well, including the recently created “inclusion” working group, which is set to begin meeting in the fall, an ongoing Department of Education Title IX investigation, and a new University-wide sexual assault policy that is awaiting Dept. of Education approval.
“It’s par for the course,” says Currier House Master Elizabeth A. Ross. “I imagine you’re focused on working on the issues that are most important for that year and thinking about who’s going to take over in the long-run. You’re not the dean; you’re the interim dean.”
Howell agreed that Pfister has in many ways “set the stage” for Khurana to work with others on future, substantial initiatives.
“I think there’s a way that the kind of atmosphere that Dean Pfister has created...has made it more likely that collaborative projects like the honor code or College initiatives will be successful,” Howell says. “Fostering that trust might not always seem like sweeping and substantive work, but it over time creates a better space for good things to happen.”
For his part, Pfister acknowledges that his tenure was not one that was particularly full of big projects and goals.
“Knowing that you’re interim, it’s...unfair to saddle someone who you know is going to be following you with projects or ideas or special things they may or may not agree with or may not feel the same way that you do about them,” Pfister says.
Reflecting on his year, Pfister says that he believes he was largely successful as dean of the College.
“I think a very healthy organization and set of relationships are being handed off, and I’m proud of that,” Pfister says, adding that he is confident Khurana would also be successful. Mayopoulos and Goffard both say they are confident their already strong relationship with Khurana will allow for productive negotiations next year, as well.
But others, while agreeing with Pfister in his assessment, emphasize that it is not so clear that things will be the same with a permanent dean.
“Let’s not be reductive about this...let’s not just have the expectation for dean of the College be that they send cute emails,” Raghuveer says. “We need to expect more of the leaders of this institution. Ideally that is a part of it, ideally that communication is maintained and that humanity is maintained, but we need to ‘get shit done.’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When hedge fund billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin ’89 donated $150 million to Harvard for financial aid and an endowed professorship earlier this year, it was page one news from coast to coast. The gift—the largest in the history of the College—came just months after the University publicly launched its $6.5 billion capital campaign, and it provided clear evidence to many that the record-seeking fundraising effort was gaining traction among the University’s richest alumni.
On campus and in campaign stump speeches, the gift was lauded as “transformational” by Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 and “a marvelous standard of generosity” by University President Drew G. Faust.
But as it rippled through the national media, news of Griffin’s donation was accompanied by an oft-leveled criticism that supporting Harvard, and its $32.7 billion endowment, potentially comes at the expense of other worthy, yet less-established institutions. “Cut Off Harvard to Save America,” economist Richard K. Vedder wrote on BloombergView, joining several other pundits in a small but vocal criticism of adding to an already large reservoir of capital.
Indeed, giving to Harvard means giving to the richest institution of higher education in the world and one of the wealthiest nonprofit organizations in the United States. Every dollar put into Crimson coffers is one that could have gone elsewhere, to an aid organization or an independent laboratory with fewer resources, where experts say the impact is more immediately felt.
On the other hand, according to University donors and fundraising experts, Harvard’s ability to attract hundreds of millions of dollars in donations each year—including $1 billion in the last eight months alone—in such a crowded philanthropic marketplace points to the perceived value of investment and the savvy of its outreach. Where many other organizations offer a singular cause with potentially uncertain results, those alumni and experts say that Harvard presents donors with a proven track record of success and a unique stake in an elite community of scholars and leaders.
All things considered, they say, investing in Harvard’s social capital is one of the surest bets on the philanthropic market.
SEPARATING FROM THE CROWD
Of the more than $316 billion that the public service initiative Giving USA estimates Americans donated to charitable causes in Fiscal Year 2012, a near-record $31 billion went to colleges and universities, according to the Council for Aid to Education.
Given those numbers and Harvard’s own projected giving total, the University will likely be among the five or so highest grossing charitable causes in the United States when Harvard’s current fiscal year ends on June 30, among groups like the United Way, the Salvation Army, the Task Force for Global Health, and Feeding America. Stanford, Harvard’s closest university fundraising rival of late, which raised a record $931 million in Fiscal Year 2013, is expected to fall into second place after nine years at the front of the university fundraising pack.
All of which points, like Griffin’s gift, to the traction of Harvard’s campaign and the priorities that have been laid out for donors, they say.
Experts divide philanthropic gifts into two major categories: those that reduce suffering in the near and long term and those that invest in human potential. Giving to a higher education institution like Harvard capitalizes on both of those motivations, according to Eugene R. Tempel, president emeritus of the Indiana University Foundation and the founding dean of the School of Philanthropy there.
“If Harvard can do outstanding research with big brains and big egos I think that is worthwhile,” says Paul G. Schervish, the director of Boston College’s Center on Wealth and Philanthropy. “[Donors] look at the University as the foundation for intellectual capital.”
Harvard and other academic institutions can present donors with an all-embracing philanthropic opportunity—one in which supporters can donate to an art museum or cancer research or even unrestricted funds, contributing to the resolution of immediate global problems, while also financing future generations of problem solvers.
To this end, the University actively tries to sell itself to as many different types of donors as possible, playing to their individual interests, says Vice President of Alumni Affairs and Development Tamara E. Rogers ’74, a strategy that allows it to encompass the social missions of many other organizations.
“What we want to do is to make them feel as though, given that they’re philanthropic, that Harvard is a place where they want to be philanthropic,” Rogers said. “It really is our responsibility to make them feel that out of all the different things that they could support in this country and in the world that Harvard makes a difference.”
Michael D. Smith, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the head of its $2.5 billion campaign, echoes Rogers, explaining that tailoring the pitch to individual donors maximizes effectiveness.
“When I sit down with a donor and they say, ‘I have an ‘X’ amount of money to give, and I can give it to you or I can give it to this other very worthy charity down the street,...[I respond that] each dollar that’s given is actually going to very meaningful activities, like financial aid, like the things we’re trying to do in the Houses, and so forth,” Smith said. “And when you start explaining it like that, it’s very meaningful especially to our own alumni who have experiences here, or to parents who have children who are now experiencing what’s happening here.”
For high-wealth donors, for whom giving to charitable causes is not a zero-sum game, excitement about a cause is as important as its worthiness, administrators and philanthropy experts say, and each individual must negotiate a personal set of factors.
“You can always trump someone’s philanthropy—you can always say you should be giving your money to ‘X’ or ‘Y’ cause instead,” Schervish says. “There’s always this possibility that what you see as more important is something that other people are not inspired to give to.”
TRIED AND TRUE
If an exciting cause is necessary to get donors to the negotiating table—be it for a building, a professorship, or a scholarship fund—the decision to make a gift is ultimately based largely on confidence in the institution to carry out its objective.
Many upper-level donors view their philanthropy in terms of a “portfolio,” according to Frederick M. Hess, the director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. And these donors see Harvard as a long-term, low-risk investment compared to many other younger, more volatile causes.
“It may or not be the most exciting thing you can do—it's not a startup, it's not going to eradicate malaria,” said Richard A. Marker, the founder of New York University’s Academy for Grantmaking and Funder Education. “But in the long run...there's a very, very high likelihood that it will do something good.”
For many potential donors, Harvard’s track record of producing world-leading ideas and people, as well as its sophisticated organizational structure, indicate that the University is well-equipped to handle and use donations effectively.
“They have a plan put in place to deal with that money,” said Maria Di Mento, an assistant editor for the Chronicle of Philanthropy who covers big giving. “Large institutions know what to do with the money, they really have a plan of how to handle the money, and they can offer something that donors can see.”
Hess says that with Harvard’s celebrated faculty, for example, donors who endow a professorship do not have reason to worry. “If one professor leaves, the whole [organization] will not fall apart.”
Donors interviewed for this story largely agree, saying that giving to Harvard entails a perpetuation of historical excellence that relies on the reputation of the past and continues it into the future. In the same way that Faust describes Harvard’s investment perspective as “long-term,” donors often view their gifts to Harvard as long-term investments in a better world.
“If you want to have an impact on the world, I can’t think of a better way to have your funds used with great leverage. I’m giving to one of the great educational institutions in the world,” says long-time University donor and venture capitalist Sidney R. Knafel ’52. “The extent that I can help that institution to raise its standard, to raise the standards of education institutions all over, will create a better educated populace in the future who will probably do a better job than we did.”
Even bumps in the investment record, like Harvard’s decades-long foray into Allston, questions about the management of its natural resources investments, or professorial ethics violations, tend to have little effect on the overall confidence in the University’s ability to translate gifts into successful research or other outcomes.
What’s more, according to Schervish, at a large university where money is fungible, even the impact of earmarked gifts will extend beyond a particular short term initiative.
“There are alumni that you are always in touch with and bringing on campus for tours and roles like the Board of Overseers and so forth, and you want them to recognize that the University is changing, and you need to stay on the leading edge of knowledge in fields that demand that people be a little bit flexible about their willingness to support,” says David Yermack ’85, who is an alumnus of the College, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the Law School, and the Business School.
PAYING TO BE A PART OF THE CLUB
Long before a donor ever gives Harvard a monetary gift, big or small, the University has in most cases been working to inspire confidence and maintain loyalty. And unlike other charitable causes where donations result in merely a letter of thanks or a one-time award, Harvard offers its backers a continued stake in an influential community long after they leave campus or even if they never stepped foot on it.
From the the senior class gift to a donor’s inclusion of Harvard in his or her will, the University employs a host of committees, reunions, networking events, and, for a wealthy few, access to top professors and leadership, to keep potential donors involved and invested. More than just altruistic satisfaction, giving to Harvard has tangible benefits.
“Once you give serious money, they never let go of you,” says Byron R. Wien ’54, a vice chairman at Blackstone Advisory Partners who donated both a professorship in drama and one in the life sciences. “Someone in the development office maintains a relationship with you and will be a presence in your life,” Wien added.
Rogers insists that while “alumni don’t owe us philanthropy,” the Alumni Affairs and Development Office ensures that donors meet representatives of the University that could engage their interest. Griffin, for example, has become close friends with Smith, according to Faust.
“Harvard keeps contributing to their life,” Schervish says, adding, “Harvard is the gift that keeps on giving, and that’s why Harvard gets gifts.”
Smaller donors, who Rogers delineated as those who contribute $10,000 or less, cite allegiance to Harvard and the desire to give back to perpetuate the opportunities from which they benefited as reasons they give.
“I am aware that for centuries people have had their educations subsidized at Harvard by alumni who donate back to the school,” says Yermack, adding that he and his wife “want to contribute to the education of the next generation knowing that the previous generation contributed to ours.”
Yermack’s perspective speaks to the University’s multilayered appeal. Familiarity and an appreciation for its mission mix with confidence in its capacity to bring an ever-widening array of goals to the marketplace of ideas.
“Whatever money I give will go a lot further than if I do it on my own or give to a lesser organization in terms of name recognition and convening power,” says Paul Zofnass ’69, who established a sustainability initiative at the Graduate School of Design with a $500,000 donation in 2008. “If you want to do some good things, having Harvard involved can power it through.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
When a Harvard College junior was handcuffed and loaded into a Harvard University Police Department van outside of Massachusetts Hall, observers knew that the arrest, which ended a blockade of top administrators’ offices, indicated that on-campus activism for fossil fuel divestment had so far reached its peak.
The increasingly visible activism, which mirrors similar movements across the country, comes after a year in which the University announced a series of high-profile, sustainability-focused initiatives—first the creation of a vice president of sustainable investing role within the Harvard Management Company, which invests Harvard’s endowment, and, more recently, Harvard’s signature on the United Nations-backed Principles for Responsible Investment.
Yet some members of the community remain unsatisfied, saying that Harvard, in the process of balancing sustainability and financial concerns, is ignoring a moral obligation to remove itself from a fossil fuel industry causing harm to humanity on a global scale. The decision to divest, they say, would follow in the footsteps of Harvard’s decision to do so for social or political reasons on previous occasions, some of which were spurred by student and alumni activism.
This disconnect between a university that believes it is taking significant strides on the sustainability front and members of the community that continue to push for more—is rooted in two fundamentally different conceptions of the meaning of responsible investment. Widening the gap is what some characterize as an eroding mechanism for incorporating student feedback into investment decisions.
THE BOTTOM LINE
University leaders have framed HMC’s commitment to environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, considerations not as a broad moral or political statement but instead as a prudent financial decision, especially in the context of the company’s status as a long-term investor of Harvard’s $32.7 billion endowment, which is the largest of any institution of higher education in the world.
 
When it was founded in 1974, HMC was tasked with managing a significant portion of the University’s endowment in-house, with the belief that their own managers could create higher returns than the traditional third-party asset managers. Since then, the company has long emphasized alternative asset classes, like private equity, natural resources, and real estate—a sharp departure from the traditional bond and stock-heavy portfolios of most university endowments.
This unique history has shaped how HMC has answered the challenge of the responsible investment movement.
Today, HMC leaders say that they consider environmental, social, and governance factors as some among many indicators of the long-term profitability of an investment.
For example, according to Jameela Pedicini, the recently hired vice president for sustainable investing at HMC, “Health and safety issues and also labor standards can play a real role in how you value a company, and ne can see that one company that has ESG performance, so here, having a good health and safety record and good labor relations, was actually performing better  than a company that didn’t.”
Pedicini’s position, which was created last February, is often cited as evidence of the company’s increasing commitment to ESG factors. She says that she is responsible for reviewing Harvard’s investments with an ESG lens and advising HMC investment managers on sustainable practices. Exactly what these practices entail, she adds, differs depending on the specific asset class.
With wholly-owned alternative assets, for example, HMC aims for compliance with industry-specific ESG standards.
“We’ve always tried to manage our forests  to standards that at least could be certified by a third party auditor,” Andrew G. Wiltshire, head of alternative assets at HMC, says.
He said that HMC takes a similar approach across all assets in the natural resource portfolio.
“We’ve looked for certification schemes that provide similar kind of assurance that what we do, according to a third party independent source, is considered first class, genuinely sustainable, and good for all stakeholders involved,” he says.
Yet HMC officials are careful to not attribute this focus on ESG standards to a deeper social role of the endowment’s investments. When asked how moral imperatives played into responsible investing, Pedicini responds by only discussing the long-term financial benefits of ESG concerns.
On the topic of the fossil fuel industry, University President Drew G. Faust has long acknowledged that Harvard as a research institution has an important role to play in combating climate change, but she has said repeatedly that manipulating the endowment should not be part of those efforts.
“The endowment is a resource, not an instrument to impel social or political change,” Faust wrote in an open letter to the Harvard community in October 2013, as she explained the University’s stance against fossil fuel divestment.
DRAWING THE LINE
Voices on and off Harvard’s campus believe that every one of HMC’s investment decisions carries certain serious political and social ramifications. Given that the significance of the endowment expands beyond Harvard’s balance sheet into the outside world, they argue, the University should ensure that its investments reflect the ethical outlook of the broader campus community, which includes students, faculty, and alumni.
David Wood, director of the Initiative for Responsible Investment, a research organization housed in the Hauser Institute for Civil Society at the Kennedy School,  argues that, regardless of how vocal these groups are, there will always be a moral boundary that, even if unacknowledged by officials, will rein in investment activities.
“One way to think about this is to acknowledge the implicit limits to what people would find acceptable,” Wood says. “No one now presumably in this kind of space would invest in the slave trade in order to make a profit, even if it was the best returning investment out there. Everyone has a limit and the question is, where do you set it?”
Whether for financial or political reasons, the University has in the past divested its endowment from interests that broad swaths of Harvard’s stakeholders found objectionable. Specifically, University leaders removed investments in some companies doing business in apartheid South Africa in 1978, from tobacco companies in 1990, and from PetroChina, an oil company with close ties to genocide-ridden Sudan, in 2005.
In making the decision to divest from tobacco companies, then-president Derek C. Bok expressed justification on a social justice platform.
The move, he said, according to a New York Times article at the time, “was motivated by a desire not to be associated as a shareholder with companies engaged in significant sales of products that create a substantial and unjustified risk of harm to other human beings.''
In the view of today’s advocates for restricting investment practices, the academic and ethical mission of universities in general cannot be separated from the mission of HMC.
“Ultimately, as an educational institution, Harvard has a unique role as a thought leader and as an action leader,” says Sam F. Wohns ’14, a co-founder of the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition, a group that has recently expressed concerns about HMC-owned timberlands in Argentina—accusations that Wiltshire has repudiated.
“We want to make sure Harvard is upholding its role as a thought and action leader,” Wohns says.
Furthermore, some argue that the unparalleled scope and size of the endowment give Harvard greater leverage to promote ESG causes as an influential shareholder—a role that Faust agreed should be used in a socially upstanding way in her open letter against divestment.
HMC is unique among university endowments in its diversification into alternative assets. As of 2013, according to HMC’s annual report, 13 percent and 10 percent of its assets were allocated to natural resources and real estate, respectively. According to many experts, because it owns most of these assets in full and thus has complete control over management decisions, Harvard has more of an ability to make a direct and immediate impact on ESG standards.
This status stands in contrast to smaller and more traditional endowments with a much larger allocation toward traditional stocks and bonds, which provide the investor with a claim to, at most, a rather insignificant portion of control over its company.
Marcie Hawkins Smith, executive director at the Responsible Endowments Coalition, suggests that Harvard holds considerable influence in the sphere of endowment investment on account of the unparalleled scale of its endowment, which is larger than the GDP of several dozen sovereign nations.
“The potential impact is really huge, if you’re talking about Harvard doing anything with respect to responsible investing,” Hawkins Smith said. “That has incredible ripple effects, not just within education but also across the pension fund space and across the foundation endowment space.”
TOEING THE LINE
At a time when Harvard’s endowment has the potential to shape national discussion on a contentious environmental issue, some say the number of voices at the table is small—smaller, even, than HMC claims.
According to Pedicini, HMC incorporates feedback from the broader university community through two main avenues: first, through the Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility and the Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility, which together form an oversight system created by HMC in 1974. The second channel of engagement, Pedicini says, is the the informal option open to student groups of sitting down with Pedicini herself.
As has been the case since the body’s inception four decades ago, the ACSR is tasked officially with making recommendations on proxy votes that come up for companies included in HMC’s public equity portfolio, which often, although not always, take up ESG concerns.
But ACSR, which consists of four students, four faculty members, and four alumni, serves in merely an advisory role. The oversight process was designed so that the ACSR reports to the four members of the Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, who sit on the CCSR, and that the CCSR wields ultimate authority over any divestment decisions.
In recent years, however, the ACSR’s influence over the endowment seems to have further diminished. Public equities have decreased from 58 to 33 percent of the portfolio since 1995, and the CCSR has voted on fewer and fewer resolutions, dropping from 157 votes in 2004 to 56 in 2013, according to the 2012-2013 CCSR annual report.
As frustration with HMC’s institutional mechanisms for incorporating student input has mounted, HMC leadership has addressed the responsible investment movement with an approach that is subtly but nonetheless fundamentally distinct from the thought process of student activists.
While HMC, like the student activists who criticize it, has stressed the importance of ESG factors in its decision-making processes, in focusing on long-term profitability instead of values, it has framed this importance  in a different light than those students.
“A lot of values talk is being buried into a business case frame,” Wood says. “There are places when [ESG and profit] overlap, but also, it’s just a more comfortable frame to have this investment discussion.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Following the first significant changes in its more than 300-year history, Harvard’s highest governing body is entering a new era with a new leader—one who, members say, reflect the stated priorities of a Harvard Corporation of the 21st century.
After a dozen years on the Corporation, Robert ‘Bob’ D. Reischauer ’63 will retire from his post as the Corporation’s senior fellow as he hits a term limit that was the cornerstone of sweeping reforms that he helped implement over the past several years. Intellectual property lawyer William F. Lee ’72, in his fourth year on the board, will take the helm as senior fellow in July 2014.
Reischauer will step down from a very different Corporation than the one that he entered, and will do so with Robert E. Rubin ’60—both of whom were appointed by and close colleagues of former University President Lawrence H. Summers. In the spring of 2010, under then-senior fellow James R. Houghton ’58, the governing body launched an internal review of its policies in response to criticism that it was disconnected from the community and excessively secretive. The reforms entailed increasing member size from seven to 13, limiting six-year terms to two in number, and instituting subcommittees on specific areas such as finance, governance, facilities and capital planning.
Building upon the foundation of the review process set up by Houghton, who served on the Corporation for 15 years, Reischauer is largely credited for working with other members of the governing body and University President Drew G. Faust to make it more open and available to students, faculty, and alumni, and to “incorporate their views in our thought process,” in the words of University Treasurer James F. Rothenberg ’68.
“[Reischauer’s] legacy, as the senior fellow who did so much to shape and implement our recent governance reforms, will carry on for decades ahead,” Faust, who also sits on the Corporation, said after the announcement of Reischauer’s retirement.
That legacy, which Lee seems poised to continue despite representing a much different generation of Harvard alumni, also defines the role of senior fellow as a soundboard for the president, rather than a forceful driver of University policy.
NATURAL CHOICES
After spending his early years living a stone’s throw from Harvard Yard at the end of Divinity Avenue—now the location of the University Herbaria—Reischauer’s affiliation with Harvard began at birth. His father, Edwin O. Reischauer, a Harvard professor in Japanese studies and former U.S. ambassador to Japan, carved the Reischauer family’s place at Harvard in stone when the University’s Institute for Japanese Studies was named in his honor.
Elected in 1996 to the Board of Overseers, the University’s other governing board for which he served a six-year term, the younger Reischauer served as director of the Congressional Budget Office and worked with Summers at the CBO. Reischauer began his term on the Corporation in 2002, and his years of service to the University made him a natural choice for senior fellow when Houghton retired.
Houghton recounts the process of the senior fellow’s appointment as something that “sort of happens.”
“It’s the fact you’ve been there the longest,” Houghton says of the “smooth” transition from him to Reischauer.
Though many also see Lee as a natural choice for the job, he differs notably from Reischauer in both his personal and professional background. While Reischauer grew up with strong Harvard ties, Lee says that he and his brothers, who also attended Harvard, could especially appreciate the opportunities it gave them, with parents “who got off the boat in 1948 without a penny to their name.”
After teaching at the Law School, involvement in a “number of different alumni activities,” and eventually election to the Board of Overseers, Lee served on the search committee for the next University President and helped make the decision to approve Faust.
“That’s where Bob and I first got to work together a lot, because it was a Corporation-Overseer committee,” Lee says. “I got to know University governance, I got to know her [Faust], and when the chance came to serve on the Corporation, it was just a unique opportunity to really come full circle and to give back to a place that had really given me an opportunity.”
Like Reischauer, many Corporation members refer to Lee as “very thoughtful,’ and say that the appointment, like that of Reischauer, came as little surprise considering his numerous years of his service to Harvard. Lee’s background in law, which Corporation members say has proven instrumental to handling legal issues, was an added bonus.
“He’s been very good about a lot of the topics that we have to deal with which...in today’s world are increasingly legalistic,” Rothenberg says.
LESS SENIOR, MORE FELLOW
With six new spots on the Corporation, which were gradually added over three years and culminated in a 13-member body in the summer of 2013, Corporation members say that the enlargement has had little effect on the group’s dynamic or Lee’s upcoming role as what has in recent years been called “the first among equals.”
Described by Faust as “a very calm voice” that will “take on any problem with great thoughtfulness and judiciousness,” Reischauer, Corporation members say, carefully considered the process of coming together and reaching agreement on a set of practices rather than dictating any outcome, a style that Lee plans to reproduce.
“He’s a low-key leader but a very effective one,” says Nannerl O. Keohane, a Corporation member since 2005 and Princeton professor who studies and teaches leadership. “He wants to make sure that issues are addressed [,] make sure that everyone is heard, and bring us to a resolution at an appropriate time. He doesn’t compose anything.”
Reischauer’s subtle leadership style fits the responsibilities required for the senior fellow of the Corporation, which is more collaborative than the title might indicate, according to other members.
“I don’t think of the senior fellow [of the Harvard Corporation] as much of a CEO or a powerful figure as you might in the corporate world,” Rothenberg says. “We generally use a retreat in the summer to set up the next year in terms of what our primary themes, topics, [and] focus will be, and it’s much different than what would be a corporate environment.”
Reischauer echoes that idea, saying that he primarily aimed to help Faust set priorities by tapping into the skills and experiences of the individual members.
“You have an extremely talented group of individuals who don’t need to be led,” Reischauer says.
An understanding of the Corporation’s cooperative nature allowed Reischauer to delegate duties to the subcommittees that formed as part of the reforms. Corporation members say that his ability to delegate has increased the group’s functional efficiency.
Keohane says that working through small-scale legal issues with six other people, as was their practice in the Corporation’s original configuration, was an inferior process to receiving recommendations from a subcommittee that has already reviewed a decision’s details, allowing the main body to strategize on a higher level.
“[Now] we’re able to sort through facilities issues, particularly financial issues, in committees and bring recommendations to the full Corporation,” Keohane says. “We discuss them around the big table, but we don’t feel we have to go into them in the same detail.”
Lee says that he intends to emulate Reischauer’s leadership style, given the open, engaged, and informal nature of the group that allows them to effectively tackle issues.
“The key to his leadership has been that he hasn’t been out front saying ‘follow me,’ and Drew’s leadership style is not ‘follow me,’” Lee says, adding that a governance structure not dependent on the particular identity of the senior fellow is crucial for the consistency and stability of Harvard’s top leadership.
To the same end, Lee emphasizes a strong and close relationship with Faust. He says that, since his appointment, he has been in contact with her two or three times each week.
ROADS TO LOEB
In addition to exhibiting an understated leadership style, Corporation members say that Lee is well-positioned to build upon the body’s progress toward opening up to the community from their meeting place in Loeb House—a central goal of its governance reforms.
Over the past three years, the Corporation has increasingly tried to shed its reputation as a mysterious black box by meeting with students and faculty on issues like divestment from fossil fuels.
“I think there’s a lot more input, a lot more openness to outside input that would not have been true a few years ago,” Rothenberg says.
A simple but important advantage of Lee’s appointment is his residence down the Charles River, which will allow a greater physical presence on campus than Reischauer, who lives and works in Washington, D.C. Lee is one of several that help constitutes an increasingly Boston-based corporation. Local businessman Joseph J. O’Donnell ’67, and Lawrence S. Bacow, president-in-residence at Harvard’s Graduate School of Education and former president of Tufts University, also live in greater Boston.
Lee also relates his interest in openness and appreciation of that quality at Harvard in particular to his personal background.
“I was one of the people who were the direct result of President [James B.] Conant’s effort to open up the University to a broader group of folks,” Lee says.
In addition to forming stronger connections with the campus, Reischauer—and, going forward, Lee—has tried to open channels of communication with other institutions. For example, Reischauer has attended meetings of chairs of boards of trustees in the Ivy League, a move that Keohane said has been facilitated by the Corporation’s new committee structure and delegation of responsibilities.
“That has given us all a sense of what our colleagues are thinking,” Keohane says. “Far from diminishing the role, he [Reischauer] has gracefully expanded it.”
It is yet to be seen how effectively Lee will continue that expansion. He has remained relatively quiet about his own priorities relative to Reischauer’s, but Corporation members have speculated that he will continue the progress the Corporation has already made.
“We have a really dynamic student body and faculty,” Lee says. “The question for us is, looking at the short term and the long term, how do we ensure that that is true ten years from now, 20 years from now, 50 years from now?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Under the leadership of an unconventional president, members of the Undergraduate Council mobilized this spring to challenge the priorities of a university currently engaged in an aggressive, multi-billion dollar fundraising drive with a public campaign of their own.
Fittingly titled “UC 250K,” the movement called on University President Drew G. Faust to grant the student governing body a six-figure increase in the pool of money it has available to fund the College’s roughly 400 student groups. The campaign culminated in a rally that drew a crowd of about 100 students who cheered on UC leaders shortly before they walked in to Massachusetts Hall to make their demands.
Harvard’s chief executive would not grant the UC’s request, and instead referred them to the deans within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences with direct control over its budget. And as UC leaders were shuffled from administrator to administrator, it became clear that the body most responsible for funding student organizations would not immediately be seeing a dime—let alone $250,000—of an increase to a budget that has been strained as the number of groups asking for funding has continued to rise.
This public clash between student leaders and administrators over the allocation of Harvard’s budgetary resources reflects a larger debate brewing over the proper place of extracurricular activities within the College’s educational model built on the values of the liberal arts. Administrators and faculty put forth a vision that prioritizes classroom learning as a means for undergraduates to cull critical thinking skills and develop a wide-ranging, rather than specialized, expertise.
While administrators maintain that what makes a Harvard education unique is the access to all-star faculty and vast academic resources, an increasing number of students say that something is missing. These students, seeking real-world skills, are opting to school themselves outside the classroom, charting their own educational courses and defining their undergraduate experiences on a thriving extracurricular culture in tension with Harvard’s institutional priorities.
A CULTURE OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM
When students come to the College, one of their first opportunities to interact with upperclassmen is not in section, but at the fair that showcases the College’s extracurricular offerings. With Annenberg closed for dinner and peers eager to explore what opportunities await, freshmen trek to the Quad, only to be bombarded by flyers, hurried explanations of organizational missions, and requests to join email lists.
Few freshmen have the time or patience to stop at every booth at that fair. Today, there are 399 active, independent student organizations recognized by the College, according to Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich. That number does not include Harvard’s 65 club sports teams, the 86 student-directed service programs offered through the Phillips Brooks House Association, nor any groups that operate without official College recognition.
Over time, this number has steadily increased.
“It’s been a pretty tremendous increase,” Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister says. “I would think probably in the last ten years there’s been 100 new student organizations.”
Student interest in particular groups has also grown. The Harvard College Consulting Group, for example, has seen a more than two-fold increase in the number of applications for membership it receives—from 105 in 2010-2011 to 339 this year—according to the group’s former director, Kenny A. Lee ’14. Likewise, the Institute of Politics, an umbrella organization composed of 13 undergraduate programs, saw a sharp increase in applications in the past year, according to President Eva A. Guidarini ’15.
Large numbers of available extracurricular opportunities fuel a campus culture where heavy extracurricular involvement is the norm. Although freshmen are, with few exceptions, limited to a four-course academic load in the fall semester, students often join not one club when they arrive on campus, but four or five—or even 12. Rebecca J. Ramos ’17 says she joined 15 student groups her freshman year, among those three club sports teams, Harvard Model Congress, CityStep, the First-Year Social Committee, and the sorority Delta Gamma—on top of two jobs.
Not all students at Harvard are so involved in student groups, but for the most invested, participation means devoting more than a few hours to out-of-classroom commitments. According to Cyatharine M. Alias ’15, her active participation in various PBHA programs costs her about half her time every week, with the rest of that time devoted to her personal life and her schoolwork. Guidarini says she spends 40 or 50 hours weekly working for the IOP, and she thinks about it “every minute.” She calls her role as the organization’s top student leader a “full-time job.”
THE VALUE ADDED
Across the board, students immersed in the College’s extracurricular culture point to the opportunity to build friendships based on shared interests and develop leadership skills as they collaborate with their peers as reasons for participating in student groups.
Brett M. Biebelberg ’16, a UC representative who also participates in first responder organization CrimsonEMS, says that student groups fill a need for social opportunities created by Harvard’s lack of a large Greek scene that is present on other college campuses. Other students add that they derive much of their social lives from the students they meet in various groups.
“One of the big drivers of [selecting extracurriculars] are whether or not [students] feel they’re making friends in the activity and whether they feel like they have a strong affinity for the people they’re meeting,” says Thomas S. Wooten ’08, a tutor in Quincy House and Ph.D. candidate in the Sociology Department who is currently researching extracurricular life at Harvard.
Wooten adds that, for some students, extracurricular life seems to be “supplanting social life with a blocking group or social life in a House.”
Beyond the social opportunities, members of student groups learn practical skills by working with peers, planning meetings, and networking while pursuing a passion, they say. The desire for applicable, real-world skills can push students to seek leadership experience in the ranks of one of many existing groups—and if they don’t like their options, they create their own.
UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15, who served as president of the humor publication Satire V before he led the UC’s charge to demand that administrators increase funding for student groups, highlights negotiation as one of the many skills he has developed through extracurriculars.
Ziyao “Eric” Wang ’15, co-president of the Harvard-Radcliffe Chinese Students Association, adds that through extracurriculars, he has learned “how to be a leader, how to manage, how to think about structural and organizational questions, how to build a network,” among other skills. Wang has been involved in a number of other groups, such as Harvard Student Agencies and the Harvard China Forum.
‘THIS IS AN ACADEMIC INSTITUTION’
While administrators and faculty largely acknowledge the educational and social value of participating in student groups, they maintain that students’ commitments to the classroom should and must remain their top priority.
"One thing that we know is that students who participate in activities will get more out of their college experience,” says Friedrich, who at the Office of Student Life oversees the registration process for student groups.
But Friedrich, like many of his colleagues, expresses the concern that some students may be having trouble balancing their extracurricular commitments with academics. “Academics do need to come first,” he says. “They are the priority here.”
History professor James T. Kloppenberg says extracurricular activities are valuable—but only if they are truly “extra” curricular, meaning that they do not supercede commitment to the academic realm.
“They should understand that they’re here to get an education, not to join 15 clubs,” adds Harry R. Lewis ’68, a computer science professor and former dean of the College.
As more organizations are created—43 of the College’s 399 groups were recognized this year, according to Friedrich—administrators and faculty worry that with meetings to attend and conferences to run, students are forgoing the chance to dive into a liberal arts curriculum in favor of fulfilling their out-of-class obligations.
“Students now have more things to do than time. So how do you calculate what you aren’t going to do and what you are going to do?” Associate Secretary of the Administrative Board Brett Flehinger asks. “With extracurriculars...you’ve got an obligation to other people, so if you’re in the leadership in a group or club and you’re running short on time, you still might feel committed to do that.”
Flehinger adds that it is not “uncommon” for students who go before the Ad Board, either for poor grades or allegations of academic dishonesty, to cite overcommitment to extracurriculars as a reason for their academic performance or actions.
Many administrators say they worry that heavy extracurricular involvement is adding unnecessary stress to students’ lives. Others share the concern that students are using their time at Harvard not to deeply engage with ideas, but to add bullet points to their resumes.
“You’ll be 22 when you graduate, you’ll be 70 when you retire, you have 48 years to work on your profession—you have four years at Harvard,” says History professor Charles S. Maier ’60. “You shouldn’t be using your four years to be adding to your 48 years for your profession.”
OUT OF THE BOOKS, INTO THE SUITS
By and large, the students who are most invested in student groups do not contest that even though they enjoy their classes, they have chosen to prioritize extracurriculars. Where their viewpoints differ from those of administrators is that they argue that their education directly benefits from this decision.
Driven in part by the desire to develop real-world skills that they say are difficult, if not impossible, to develop in a traditional liberal arts classroom, these students turn to extracurriculars for what they describe as a more engaging learning experience than the classroom.
“I've never had to manage people in a classroom setting,” Mayopoulos says. “Extracurriculars provide you with all of these opportunities that don't really have any other place to occur at Harvard.”
Although some professors, like Maier, decry this devotion to pre-professional pursuits, extracurricular involvement takes on special significance for students looking to gain the skills necessary for professional careers.
Ryley R. Reynolds ’15, president of HSA, says she chose Harvard over Wharton, the University of Pennsylvania’s business school, precisely to participate in the College’s extracurriculars. Reynolds says she had planned to attend Wharton, but at Visitas, some students at HSA asked her: “Why learn about business when you can actually run a business?” That opportunity—not Harvard’s academics—prompted her to change her mind.
Reynolds is not alone. Many students say they choose to come to Harvard with extracurricular opportunities in mind, and when they arrive, some go as far as to say that they learn more from their experiences outside of the classroom than in it.
“I’m much more passionate about finding a way to make the Harvard China Forum better than trying to figure out how to make my p-set better,” Wang says. “I do both, but I’m more passionate about the former.”
Critical faculty members suggest that students might be less likely to prioritize extracurriculars over the classroom if courses were more rigorous, engaging, or both. Many students say that their extracurricular commitments are actually more challenging than their academics, because peers keep them accountable for doing their work.
“I blame the faculty,” says Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53. “If you get an easy A, there’s no way you’re going to work as hard as if you don’t.”
The academic literature lends credence to this sentiment. According to a paper by sociology professor Christopher Winship, grade inflation in higher education could help explain why the amount of time students spend studying has decreased by 50 percent in the last four decades.
TWO ROADS DIVERGE
The spring’s UC campaign for student funding was, in a sense, demonstrative of conflicting views about the importance of the parts of a Harvard experience.
“When it comes to where you are putting your money, the administration has shown very clearly that they don't see [extracurriculars] as a priority for students," Mayopoulos says.
And while, as reflected in its capital campaign priorities, Harvard continues to reaffirm its identity as an academic institution built on a tradition of teaching and learning, some students still define their undergraduate experiences by their time outside of class. They instead opt to go down their own paths to an undergraduate education, learning from peers more often than books.
“I will always define my experience at Harvard looking back based on the extracurriculars that I did, not necessarily the class work that I did,” Guidarini says. “I love my classes, but the bulk of my life—my social life, my time, my involvement—has been in extracurricular activities, and I think that’s always how I’ll define my time at Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two years ago this month, Harvard and MIT launched edX, a non-profit virtual learning platform to educate people across the globe and shed light on how students learn. To date, the joint venture has attracted dozens of partners, from top-tier research universities to international organizations, as well as more than two million users. Yet questions about the efficacy of online courseware, edX’s rapid growth, and the platform’s financial sustainability remain.
Anant Agarwal, an MIT computer science professor who has served as CEO of edX since its establishment, sat down with The Crimson to recount the challenges of creating courses for an online learning environment, discuss the non-profit’s business model, and speculate about what the future might hold for edX. The interview has been edited for clarity and concision.
 
The Harvard Crimson: At the time of edX’s launch, there was a lot of speculation into what the platform might look like and what it might do to transform higher education. What was your vision for edX at the beginning?
Anant Agarwal: So when we started edX,  our vision for edX had three legs to the stool, so to speak. The first part of our mission was that we wanted to increase access to learners all over the world, millions of students everywhere,  and with our very first course, we reached 155,000 students in 162 countries, and that gave us initial confidence that maybe this would work. Today, two years out, we are at 2.3 million students in 196 countries around the world, and so in terms of the growth and number of students taking courses, it’s certainly exceeded our expectations.
The second leg of the stool for our mission is improving education on our campuses. In other words, how do you improve the quality of education on campuses and online? And our goal was to look at new ways of innovating and learning around multiple dimensions. So for example, one aspect of it was [the question of] how do you create very rich interactives, how do you create virtual laboratories so you get much a better experience for a student taking a course online. Similarly, we wanted to be able to allow students to do things like be able to get instant feedback. When you offer assessments and exercises, students can get feedback, and that is a really good thing. So we want to use that technology of instant feedback to improve the learning experience whether you’re on campus or somewhere 10,000 miles away. For learners even on campus, normally you submit homework, and the homework might come back to you graded hopefully later, sometimes never, and that decreases the motivation for completing the homework, figuring out where you’re going wrong, and trying to do better, but if you can do instant feedback, you can do a lot better. Students get a lot more motivated, and learners are telling us that on campus when they are using the edX platform, they are working much harder on homework because students have a natural competitive streak in them. They want to get things right, and when they know something’s wrong, they keep working at it to get things right. In fact, when I taught a blended class at MIT in our very first course, many students would come to me jokingly and say, “Professor Agarwal, you have me working much harder on homework than I’ve ever worked before.” I said, “what do you mean?” They said, “We can keep trying to get something right so we just keep working hard. I’m just spending way too much time on this platform.” I would joke to them, “well is that a good thing or a bad thing?” So I think creating instant feedback and instant grading and simulation-based laboratories helps more students on campus and worldwide, and combining the best of online and in-person [education], we want to improve the campus experience as well.


 The third leg of the stool was research. We wanted to do research in learning to see how students learn and thereby improve the whole learning experience itself. So when we started, those were the three big aspects of our mission—access, improving education quality on campus and beyond, and research. Two years into it, I feel we’ve made a decent dent into all three of these.
THC: That being said, in the first two years, what were the biggest challenges that you saw in getting edX off the ground?
AA: Oh my goodness. I’m not even sure where to start. There were so many challenges. Frankly, when MIT and Harvard came together to do this thing there was a huge speculative experimental nature to it. We knew where we wanted to go but had no idea how to get there, so it was like jumping off a cliff saying, “we want to get down,” but then looking around and saying, “well, who’s got the parachutes?” But we knew where we wanted to go. The beauty of doing this was that by committing to doing it, you knew that you had to succeed. You had to bring your parachutes along the way, you had to experiment and build things along the way. Failure was not an option, you had to succeed. So we built a number of things as we went along.
I’ll give you a number of examples. One challenge was that for many of the humanities courses—we want to strongly support the humanities—[we needed platforms for] open response and being able to assess students in things beyond multiple choice. You want them to be able to write essays, descriptive answers and so on. When we started edX, we knew that was a challenge but had no idea how to do it, but a year into it, our team built a number of technologies to be able to support that. They built peer-grading. They built A.I. assessment and a number of techniques that they are experimenting with to grade some of these things, and we’ve already gone from version one to version two, so version two of “Open Response Assessment,” called “ORA2” came out three months ago, so we’ve been building and refining a lot of these things. So building an open response was a challenge, so we continued to refine and improve that.
I think a second one was [the question of] how do you do things like answer questions. We knew the moment that we saw 150,000 students taking a course, we had this amazing “Oh-my-god moment.” So the first response we had, which I discussed with our team, our instructors, and our TAs was “seven by twenty-four.” We were going to sit down and answer questions on forums seven by twenty-four, so we thought that was a really big challenge. There, we had a huge epiphany one night. I was up at 2 o’clock at night, answering questions on a discussion forum. I type pretty slowly, and when I was typing an answer, I noticed that a student from Pakistan had jumped in with an answer. It wasn’t quite the right answer, so I tried to correct the answer, and before I could type the right answer, someone else had jumped in. I sat back fascinated, and students kept discussing it and by 4 a.m., they had figured out the right answer. Then I could go in and say that’s the right answer.
THC: So that’s sort of a “Wikipedia” model for answering questions.
AA: Exactly. It’s almost like a Wikipedia-style approach to answering questions, where students discuss themselves. The beauty of this, by the way, unlike Wikipedia, is that learning is in the journey. Oftentimes, when someone shows you the answer, that may not be as good as discovering the answer for yourself. If you’ve read ‘The Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,’ which has been a huge influence in my life, it’s not where you get to, it’s how you get there, so as students work together to get the answer, many have told us that they are actually learning by teaching. So that was a huge learning experience for us. It was a huge challenge, but resulted in the way students answer each others’ questions and learn in the process.
When we first started edX, authoring courses was a real challenge. We had to use XML, which is a programming approach to writing problems and questions, and you had to be a computer scientist in order to be able to author a course. Frankly, at that time, we had somewhat of the naive view that we could help author courses and would build a huge support team to help people author courses. So we would have people that could work with professors and help them author courses where the computer science side of authoring courses would be done by us. We very quickly found that it was very expensive, it would not scale, and that professors and schools wanted much more control over how they did things, so we rapidly, rapidly created a huge initiative called “Studio.” We built an authoring platform as part of the whole system. It’s like GarageBand for courses. It makes it much easier for mere mortals to author courses, and frankly that has been a game-changer. Whether you’re teaching a humanities course or a computer science course or an engineering course, it’s become significantly easier to author courses. Frankly, I think we have a long way to go, but we’ve come a long way. I think that was a huge challenge, and I think we’ve made a dent in authoring courses as well.
THC: On edX’s website, there’s a list of guiding principles, the first of which is, “not for profit,” and the last of which is “financially sustainable.” These two ideas are not necessarily at odds with each other, but are edX’s current sources of revenue sufficient to sustain it long-term?
AA: I’m glad you said that being a non-profit does not mean non-revenue. It does not mean non-sustainable. The difference between a startup and a non-profit startup is that get their investments from venture capitalists. Then, they expect a return on investment, so you have to make profits to return on investments for your investors. At edX, our investment comes from Harvard and MIT. Many of our university partners have contributed substantially as well, and philanthropic foundations contribute. At the same time, we want to be sustainable, so we want to be able to generate revenue so that we can not only sustain ourselves, but more importantly, sustain our university partners. Our university partners are spending anywhere from $50,000 to $250,000 or more to create courses and so right now, they are spending that money to put those courses on edX and also to use those courses on their own campuses. That said, we need to find revenues to sustain their efforts as well so the ecosystem can continue. There’s only so long that courses will keep putting courses on edX without seeing some way of sustaining themselves.
THC: I know initially, there was a $30 million investment from Harvard as well as a matching $30 million from MIT, so a total of about $60 million. How much of that initial investment is remaining two years in?
AA: I want to point out that it’s MIT and Harvard, but many other universities have contributed and many of the foundations have also contributed. I would say that we still have significant portions of all the investments that are still available to us and so, we have a significant amount of runway for several years. We are pretty comfortable that we have the time to reach sustainability, and so we are quite happy with that.
We started out, frankly, with not that many ideas about how to generate revenue that would sustain us, so we have been experimenting for a couple of months. So one model that we used at the beginning was that we would issue certificates for a fee. Right from day one, we said we would charge for certificates and we would charge the order of magnitude of the cost of a textbook for these certificates. So the course would be free, but we would charge for certificates. That was one approach, so we launched verified certificates last year, where a student can take a course for free—they can even get a free honor code certificate. However they would have to pay a fee that could range from $50 to $250 for a verified certificate where we use webcams to compare the face to the photo ID to make sure they are who they say they are. We charge a small fee to do that. So it turns out that that can be quite a healthy source of revenue. However, our experiments have shown that that alone is not going to be sufficient. So, we expect that it’s going to be like a Swiss-army knife, where we need more than a single blade in our arsenal, but that is one blade.
We are experimenting with a number of other approaches. A second source of revenue is called course licensing. As you know, we have open-sourced our platform, so a number of countries have adopted it. The Middle East has adopted our platform and created edRawq. The Queen Rania Foundation. China has launched a platform called XuetangX. France has launched a platform called “FUN”—France Université Numerique. So many of them are coming to us, [asking to license courses from edX.] So a second line of business is that they pay us a fee to license courses, so we are generating a revenue for our partners and for ourselves from licensing courses.
A third approach is executive education or professional education where we create a line of business where you charge for certain types of courses and there’s no free version of certain types of courses and professional ed is one example of a class of courses. We did a pilot with a big data course in partnership with MIT and that partnership went extremely well. We are looking to create executive education as well.
These are three examples of businesses and we believe that these three, perhaps with one or two others that you will discover along the way, give us confidence that we will be sustainable along with our partners.
THC: Is there a quantitative breakdown of edX’s finances in terms of how much revenue has been brought in from things like the verified certificates and course licensing?
AA: Right now, we haven’t provided a detailed breakdown of where revenue is coming from how much the revenue is. It’s still the early days. It’s still very experimental, but I think as we solidify this and get more comfortable with the number and put our future plans together, I think that’s when we can feel a lot more comfortable providing these numbers at that time.
THC: edX saw a major change of leadership in the hiring of COO Wendy Cebula, which was actually on the same day as the hiring of Richard Levin as the [CEO] of Coursera [edX’s major competitor]. What do these two hires indicate about the directions in which edX and Coursera are going in?
AA: At edX, we expanded our leadership team. We were looking for a really strong, business-oriented COO and president, [one] who worked with a large company, someone who understands how to execute on a business, which is why we had an international search and we identified Wendy Cebula and are absolutely delighted that she came on board edX. Previously, she was on the leadership team that was running a billion dollar company [Vistaprint], so we brought her in because we really believe that financial sustainability is a critical, critical aspect of what we have to do. There are three legs of our mission, of course, but at the same time, you want to be sustainable, and bringing in Wendy Cebula was a clear and strong indication that we view sustainability as extremely important, not just for edX, but for our partners. In fact, edX views the sustainability of our partners as one of our corporate goal, so we will use that as a corporate goal to say, “Look, all of us have to be sustainable, not just edX.”
And second is that we want to continue to execute very effectively internally and oftentimes, non-profits have been dinged for less than stellar execution in comparison to a for-profit company, and from day one, we have run edX as a startup company, but a non-profit startup. We want to continue in that vein. Like any startup company, we want to be super innovative. We want to be hardworking. We want to be extremely effective and efficient. We want to continue to be that and so, we brought in Wendy to really continue on a path of extremely effective execution.
THC: Do you believe that virtual education could ever replace face-to-face interactions, which have been the norm for teaching since the dawn of humanity essentially? If so, would that be a worthwhile development?
AA: I really believe that online learning, and virtual education is another tool in our arsenal. What tools have we given teachers for the past 500 years? We’ve given teachers chalk, blackboards, textbooks, and dare I say, the PowerPoint. We haven’t given teachers a whole lot of tools. I think clicker technology is a tool that some people have begun to use, but there’s not a whole lot of tools that technology has given teachers. We believe that online learning is another tool in our educational arsenal. I don’t believe that online learning will replace in-person learning. We believe it will augment it. So for the students who do not have access to school, who do not have access to great teachers, it can suffice for giving them an education. But certainly for students who already have access to teachers and access to learning, online learning can improve the quality of their education by creating models in which we combine the best of online learning  and in-person. That is why I like to say that online learning is like a rising tide that will lift all boats—it’ll increase access to those who don’t have access, and will improve learning for those who do have access. It really could help everybody. I really don’t see it as a replacement. I see it as creating another extremely powerful tool in our educational arsenal.
THC: The finding of a set of working papers this spring showed that relatively few people who registered for a HarvardX or MITX a course actually viewed all the chapters—much less received a certificate of completion. In a physical classroom or a lecture-hall setting, seeing these high attrition rates would likely be somewhat shocking to a teacher. Why is edX not held to the same standards that a physical classroom would be?
AA: First of all, I think edX should be held to the same standards as a physical classroom. However, the metric—the completion rate—is not comparing apples to apples. I would like to answer the question in two ways. First, let’s talk about the metric. The metric says that if you have a 100,000 students who registered, all they did was express interest in the course. All they had to do was click on something and they showed up for the course and 6 percent passed the course. So in the denominator, you have students who simply clicked a link expressing interest in taking a course. If you take a course in a classroom, at Harvard and MIT, the pass rate might be upwards of 95 percent. We are comparing that, in the denominator, to students that have registered for the course, and are taking the course for credit.
I used to teach a course on parallel computing at MIT, and it was typical that on the first day of class, 80 students would show up, so people were shopping around for courses. But if you look at the number of students who pass the course in the end it would be on the order of 40 students, but you don’t say the pass rate is 50 percent, so how do we get 96 percent as a pass rate? 80 students showed up as auditors, but of those, only 45 would end up taking the course for credit, of which 42 or 43 students might pass the course. But we don’t count the pass rate as a fraction of the number of people who showed up on the first day of the course.
So I think we need to think about metrics, so a better metric is a pass rate as a fraction of students who signed up for a verified certificate and are paying a small fee. And if you look at the proportion of students who pass the course as a fraction of those who signed up for a verified certificate, it is on the order of 60 percent. So I think we should compared apples to apples.
That said, we do want to improve the completion rate for courses. We want more people to sign up for certificates and we want more people to pass the course once they sign up for a certificate. We’re looking at a number of ways to improve that as well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
Though he would become a household name in holistic medicine, during his time at the College, Dr. Andrew T. Weil ’63-’64, like many of his peers, was still deciding between concentrations. He would go on to graduate from Harvard Medical School, but as a first-year student he admitted he “had no idea” what he wanted to do with himself.
While Weil thought he might be a writer or a journalist, he changed his concentration from psychology to linguistics before finally settling on biology with a focus on botany.
“He looked like a doctor then,” said Hendrik Hertzberg ’65, Weil’s Lowell roommate and former managing editor of The Crimson.
Hertzberg described Weil as having been portly and balding early, but as looking the same now as he did then, save for the beard. “When he put a white coat on, he...could wander freely through any hospital,” Hertzberg said.
However, Weil’s successful career in promoting integrative medicine, a field he helped found, would come later. At the College, Weil enjoyed the camaraderie, creativity, and hijinks of extracurricular activity.
HARVARD HUMOR
Beyond his academic interests, Weil was well-known among classmates for his sense of humor and practical jokes.
While already an editor for The Crimson, Weil joined the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine. Holding positions on both publications proved to be “fun and a bit tricky,” according to Weil.
“Andy was a wizard and a trickster and he essentially convinced both The Crimson and the Lampoon that he was a double agent for the other side,” Hertzberg said.
According to Hertzberg, Weil orchestrated the theft of the Lampoon’s rooftop ibis statue. He went so far as to publish a series of stories about the ibis statue’s travels around the globe, which ran on the frontpage of The Crimson. The series was printed along with photos that had in fact been staged in front of large posters of the exotic locations, which ranged from Japan to Switzerland.
In another elaborate prank, in his dorm in Claverly Hall, Weil rigged a radio to play classical music and then suddenly cut to an announcement of imminent nuclear war.
“I remember that the then-managing editor of The Crimson immediately called into the The Crimson and started yelling, and one of the richer boys immediately called his family who arranged a private jet to take him to the fallout structure that they had built in the North,” Hertzberg recalled.
Weil’s sense of humor fit in with other members of the Lampoon during his time who went on to expand their comic brand outside of Harvard.
“[Weil] was an extremely funny person,” Hertzberg said. “[He was] a part of a group of people who went on to create the National Lampoon and Saturday Night Live, making American humor as we know it.”
MEDICINE AND A MELDING OF INTERESTS
During his time as an undergraduate, Weil was exposed to the polarizing debate over the use of psychedelic drugs at Harvard. In 1962, the controversial research of Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert, who administered drugs such as LSD and psilocybin to Harvard students in the Harvard Psilocybin Project, was uncovered.
Though Weil was influenced by psychedelic culture, he ultimately chose to combine his interest in alternative medicine with traditional medicine. Weil said he had an intuition that a degree in medicine would prove useful to him.
“I wanted a medical education as a better way of understanding human beings,” he said.
Weil’s choice of medicine was also motivated by a desire to field questions about his post-graduation plans and, amidst growing anti-war sentiment, a way to avoid the draft.
After completing his medical degree, Weil moved to Washington, D.C. to work at the National Institute of Mental Health for one year, but his interests broadened and he became increasingly interested in therapeutic plants and natural medicine.
From 1971-1975, Weil traveled extensively in North America, South America, and Africa to study the use of plants as medicine and alternative forms of healing in other cultures. He also served on the staff of the Harvard Botanical Museum from 1971-1984, furthering his study of medicinal plants.
Nearly a decade out of college, in 1973, Weil and a few friends convened in Bogota to see a solar eclipse. According to Jay M. Pasachoff  ’63, who traveled with Weil, his friends came away from that trip with a better understanding of his interests in botany and medicinal plants, which he was willing to try, and about his controversial beliefs about the body’s ability to heal itself. They learned there that he wanted to start a movement in medicine.
Weil went on to establish the field of integrative medicine, which one author on Drweil.com defined as “healing-oriented medicine that takes account of the whole person (body, mind, and spirit), including all aspects of lifestyle. It emphasizes the therapeutic relationship and makes use of all appropriate therapies, both conventional and alternative.”
Though Weil never became a practicing physician, he used his medical background to pursue its convergence with alternative methods.
“It just happened as a result of following my own truth,” Weil said.
CHANGE THROUGH CELEBRITY
Weil built a brand for himself, selling scores of books, launching a website, and creating his own line of health supplements, all bearing the recognizable image of his white-bearded face. He also continues to serve as the director of the Center for Integrative Medicine, which he founded in 1994, at the University of Arizona’s college of medicine.
The publication of Weil’s first international bestseller “Spontaneous Healing” in 1995 made him a household name and was the beginning of his renown as a proponent of holistic medicine.
Indeed, Pasachoff recalled walking down Broadway in New York City and seeing a large picture of Weil in the display window at Barnes & Noble.
Hertzberg has a similarly memory, “I remember walking around Whole Foods in Santa Fe with Andy…ten years ago… [it was] like going to a rock concert with Mick Jagger. People kept coming up to him and telling him how much he changed their lives for the better.”
Despite reservations about the societal power of celebrity, Weil said the proliferation of the practice of integrative medicine satisfies his wish to start a movement in healthcare.
“I have mixed feelings about [it], but believe I’ve been able to leverage my celebrity to change medicine and medical education…the field of integrative medicine that I founded is becoming mainstream and will shape the future of medicine and healthcare,” Weil explained. “This is what I am supposed to be doing.”
In the career he has established for himself, Weil draws upon a variety of skills beyond medicine.
Hertzberg described him as a writer, a journalist, a reporter, a public speaker whose talks are filled with humor, and a wildly successful businessman. But most of all, “a lot of people have benefitted from what he has done,” Hertzberg said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
In the months that followed the assassination of President John F. Kennedy '40 on Nov. 22, 1963, members of the Kennedy family and administration met routinely with University President Nathan M. Pusey ’28, in hopes of realizing the late President’s wish that his national memorial consist of three parts—a museum, a library, and a political institute—and that it stand next to the Harvard campus.


The plans laid out in 1963 by Pusey and the executors of the Kennedy will would be abandoned over a decade later in the face of legal setbacks and community opposition. Ultimately, the Charles River came to separate the three-part memorial complex Kennedy originally envisioned. The Institute of Politics was established on Harvard’s campus, while the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum was erected across the river in Columbia Point, Boston.
According to reports from The Harvard Crimson, in the spring of 1963, President Kennedy surveyed the Harvard campus twice in search of potential sites for his memorial, settling upon a spot across the Charles River from Dunster House, on the grounds of the Business School. 
President Kennedy and Pusey signed an agreement that summer, solidifying the Business School location as the future site of the John F. Kennedy memorial.
Soon after President Kennedy’s assassination, in December 1963, Pusey announced that the University would deed several acres of land for the memorial to the federal government. But plans progressed slowly, and in the meantime, in 1966, the Institute of Politics opened its doors at its first site next to Lowell House on Mount Auburn St. Supervision of the IOP fell under the Graduate School for Public Administration, which was renamed the John F. Kennedy School of Government. 
The Kennedy Library Corporation explicitly abandoned plans for uniting the Institute of Politics with the JFK Library and Museum at the Business School Site in 1975, due in part to difficulties in securing the land for development and opposition from community members who were concerned about noise pollution and overcrowding from tourists.
But, according to C. M. Trey Grayson ’94, outgoing director of the Institute of Politics, the IOP and the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum continue to collaborate on endeavors like the New Frontier Awards, a set of awards given by the IOP and the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation each year to honor young Americans in public service.
“We somewhat jokingly refer to the Library and the IOP as fraternal twins separated at birth,” Grayson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
While an undergrad at Harvard, J. Michael Crichton ’64 had a passion for writing, though he did not turn his full attention to these pursuits until later in his career. A physical anthropology concentrator, Crichton went on to attend Harvard Medical School, publishing his first novel in 1966 under a pseudonym. 
Crichton, the well-renowned science fiction author who wrote novels such as “Jurassic Park” and “The Andromeda Strain,” was described by former Crimson editorial chair Robert W. Gordon ’63 as having a “multiform intelligence” in College, though in person “he was relatively understated.”
His extracurricular pursuits at the College often dovetailed with his interests in film, literature, and science, which later defined his career. 
Eighteen years after the publication of his best known novel, “Jurassic Park,” Crichton unexpectedly passed away on Nov. 4, 2008, due to throat cancer at the age of 66. 
The online memorial, featured on the author’s official website, quoted Steven Spielberg, who directed the movie adaptation of Crichton’s “Jurassic Park”. “Michael's talent out-scaled even his own dinosaurs of Jurassic Park. He was the greatest at blending science with big theatrical concepts, which is what gave credibility to dinosaurs again walking the Earth.” Spielberg wrote. “Michael was a gentle soul who reserved his flamboyant side for his novels.” 
A Budding Writer 
At the College, Crichton was remarkable for many reasons—from his writing, to his scholarship, to his height. 
Standing at 6’ 9”, Crichton was the tallest of his freshman year roommates in Weld, who were all above 6’ 4” tall. “We were put together freshman year because Harvard was so unimaginative that they couldn’t think of any other way than to put the tall guys together” Crichton’s roommate Joseph W. Esherick ’64 said. 
As a friend, Crichton was well-liked. “Mike was very sharp; not outspoken, not obnoxious, as, I hesitate to say, many Harvard people are.  He was my opportunity to learn certain East Coast manners,” Esherick said.
Crichton also wrote both in public and in private. He was an editor on The Harvard Crimson writing pieces ranging from book reviews to news clippings to sports game recaps. 
Esherick recalled that after taking a creative writing course, Crichton became more serious about his fiction writing. 
According to Gordon, Crichton wrote a number of “pulp fiction detective novels” while he was a student, though none of his books were published until after graduation.
He also succeeded academically, graduating summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa. He was awarded the Henry Russell Shaw Travelling Fellowship, which allowed him to serve as a visiting lecturer at Cambridge University.
Gordon said that Crichton was a person of incredible talent, able to succeed at nearly anything he set his mind to. “It was only later on that many of us learned about many of the amazing different things he was doing at the time.  He was a colossally talented guy,” Gordon said. 
Crichton intended to practice medicine, Esherick said, writing his novels first as a form of personal entertainment, and eventually as means to support himself through medical school. His first five books were published under the pen names John Lange and Jeffrey Hudson. 
He graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1969, the same year that his book “A Case of Need” won an Edgar Award, a prestigious prize in the mystery genre. Upon receiving the award, Crichton decided to dedicate his career to his part-time job as an author and publish under his own name.
Professional And Best-Selling 
Over the course of just over 40 years, Crichton published more than 25 novels and was credited on 13 films. Collectively, 200 million copies of his books have been sold worldwide. 
The film adaptation of “Jurassic Park” (1993) was a huge success, globally grossing over $914 million. Connecting his experience in medicine to his career in writing, Crichton created the Emmy-winning medical drama ER, which was on the air from 1994-2009.
On a memorial page to Crichton, ER executive producer John Wells was quoted, “Michael Crichton was an extraordinary man. Brilliant, funny, erudite, gracious, exceptionally inquisitive and always thoughtful. No lunch with Michael lasted less than three hours and no subject was too prosaic or obscure to attract his interest.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Until the Dean of Women at Penn State University nominated her to go to Harvard Business School her senior year of college, Barbara Hackman Franklin, a member of the Business School class of 1964, had not seriously considered going into business.
“I did not really know what HBS was but at least I had heard of Harvard and that seemed to be a good place to be,” Franklin said.
But after first entering the business world, Franklin never left. She went on to pursue a career in both the private and public sector, becoming a leader in both.
Franklin broke several glass ceilings for women while she served on the board of multiple corporations, worked with President Nixon to increase job opportunities for women, and held the position of Secretary of Commerce under President George H. W. Bush.
12 of 680
When HBS faculty voted to allow women into the school’s two-year MBA program in December of 1962, Franklin was one of the first women to take classes on the Business School’s campus, and one of only 12 women among 680 men in her graduating class.
Her male classmates, Franklin said, had mixed reactions about the new coeducational classes. She noted that while some felt that she was taking away a space from a man, others—such as men with working mothers—had a positive reaction to her presence.
Ed A. Hajim, Franklin’s classmate in the Business School Class of 1964, recalled that Franklin handled studying in a male-dominated environment well. “Among the women [at HBS], she was at least one of the strongest of the group,” he said.
Franklin faced a similar gender imbalance when she entered the workplace, coming up against the attitude that women should not pursue careers.
She recounted one instance of overt gender discrimination. “I knew I was being paid less than another guy who was an MBA, who was sitting right beside me,” Franklin said. “I raised that with my boss, and said that I didn’t understand why I was paid less. I actually was there longer than he had [been]. And I was told ‘you’re doing fine for a girl, and you have a husband who works.’”
However, Franklin also pointed out the amount of change for women she has seen during her career, a change that she helped bring about through her work advocating for more economic opportunity and equality for women.
“Long Story Short, We Did It”
One of Franklin’s first efforts began a few years after graduating. She was approached by a former HBS classmate to work on an initiative by former President Nixon to recruit more women for staff positions. She worked with the president to double the number of women, using an approach she called “management by objectives, Harvard Business School style,” in which she monitored the progress of female employees and reported to President Nixon on their progress.
Franklin also travelled around the country in order to find qualified women to fill these positions, a project she said was often very difficult. One such difficulty, she recalled, was an attempt to work with executive recruiters, but none of them had any women on file.
“There were not that many women in the workforce who were visible,” she said. “And it took some doing to find them, but I did find them. They generally were under-titled, and under-paid given the responsibilities they had.”
She described her success in few words. “Long story short, we did it,” Franklin said. “We passed that milestone before the year was up. We tripled the number of women in the first year.”
Hajim said that these results were typical for Franklin, who displayed a “quiet competence” in her work. “In anything she has undertaken, public or private, whatever she’s involved in, it improves,” he said.
Franklin was featured in the book “A Matter of Simple Justice: The Untold Story of Barbara Hackman Franklin and a Few Good Women” for her work in promoting White House jobs for women.
According to Franklin, President Nixon’s initiative created a ripple effect for other working women, and brought the idea of women’s liberation into more mainstream politics, citing legislation such as Title IX.
“Equality for women became legitimate,” she said.
BOARD DIVERSITY 
In the 1980s, Franklin began to serve on various corporate boards, on which she was often the only woman. According to Reatha Clark King, who serves with Franklin on the National Association of Corporate Directors, Franklin was able to excel in her work.
“When you’re the only woman on the board, the challenge is to get your voice heard,” King said. “[Franklin] was very courageous in being able to do that.”
Franklin said that her experience in public service has allowed her to thrive in the boardroom and provide a unique perspective. Similarly, she reflected that her work in the private sector helped her to be successful as Secretary of Commerce.
Since she began participating on corporate boards, King said, one of Franklin’s main priorities has been to increase their diversity.
A Culture Change
According to classmates and co-workers, Franklin has pursued advocacy for gender equality throughout her life.
As an alumna, she has taken similar initiatives to further promote opportunities for women at the Business School. She recalled a time she sat down with former Business School Dean Kim B. Clark ’74 to discuss how to increase the number of female students.
“I didn’t even know him,” she said. “I got an appointment with him and laid out my little plan.”
More informally, Franklin has helped other women advance their careers, such as by helping them get positions on corporate boards. “I do that out of my back pocket,” she said. “I really believe that women who have achieved a certain level and have the ability to help other women climb the ladder really should do it. I think we have a responsibility to help each other.”
Franklin has also worked to advance the interests of women through more long-term attitudinal shifts in the culture of an organization. She said, “You don’t make culture changes in one fell swoop in an afternoon. It takes persistence and desire to do it.”
According to Hajim, Franklin’s persistence has been one of the defining characteristics of her career. “She’s carried this crusade for women all through her life,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
"Law requires both a heart and a head," U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen G. Breyer, a member of the Harvard Law School class of 1964 said during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing in 1994. "If you don't have a heart, it becomes a sterile set of rules removed from human problems, and it won't help. If you don't have a head, there's the risk that in trying to decide a particular person's problem in a case that may look fine for that person, you cause trouble for a lot of other people, making their lives yet worse. So it is a question of balance."
Throughout Breyer’s career as a professor at the Law School, Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, and finally a Supreme Court Justice, friends and colleagues agree that he has demonstrated his commitment to this balance, striving for justice through a pragmatic approach to the law.
An Early Aptitude for Law
 
Breyer was born in San Francisco, California, in 1938. He attended Lowell High School, where he excelled on the debate team. In a 1994 interview, his high school debate coach said, “You can spot the potential lawyers early.... He would do copious research on a debate topic while other kids were out, you know, doing things like stealing hubcaps." Breyer’s classmates also predicted his future achievements, voting him “most likely to succeed” when he graduated in 1955. 
 
Breyer was accepted to both Stanford and Harvard undergrad, and though he preferred the latter, his parents urged him to go to Stanford as his mother did not want him to become too bookish, according to an article by U.S. News and World Report. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Stanford in 1959. 
He then entered Harvard Law School upon completing two years at Oxford as a Marshall scholar. His criminal law section in the fall of 1961 was taught by Law School professor Charles Fried, who said Breyer was a “very smart, playful, and curious” student. Breyer was the articles editor of the Harvard Law Review, and graduated in 1964 magna cum laude.
Back at HLS
 
Breyer returned to the Law School in 1967 to work as an assistant professor and then as a full professor, teaching administrative law, until 1980. Former professor Alan M. Dershowitz noted that he and Breyer have a similar teaching style. “We’re both very questioning, we’re both very skeptical,” Dershowitz said.
When Professor Charles J. Ogletree was a student, he met Breyer not through class but instead through Breyer’s public interest work. At the time, Breyer was “the force,” Ogletree said, working to ensure that Law School students had public interest opportunities as alternatives to jobs at corporate law firms. 
Breyer has returned to the Law School for many events and lectures over the past couple of decades. In one event this past fall, he held a question and answer session with current Law School Dean Martha L. Minow during which he explained the inner workings of the Supreme Court. Minow noted in an email that Breyer’s “careful and clear explanations of the work of the United States Supreme Court and his candid responses to questions showed what a great teacher he is.”
 
“The Epitome of Fairness”
After working as a professor, Breyer served as Chief Judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, and was then nominated for the Supreme Court by President Clinton in 1994. Clinton said in his announcement, “Without dispute, [Breyer] is one of the outstanding jurists of our age. He has a clear grasp of the law, a boundless respect for the constitutional and legal rights of the American people, a searching and restless intellect, and a remarkable ability to explain complex subjects in understandable terms.”
 
Breyer was sworn in on August 3 as a U.S. Supreme Court Justice of the United States.
Breyer’s friends and colleagues note his pragmatic approach to law. “He is the epitome of fairness,” Dershowitz said. “He never allows an ideological thumb to be put on the scale of justice. He is a man of deep principle and pragmatism at the same time.”
Fried pointed to the continuity between Breyer’s work as a professor and as a justice. “What stands out is an attempt to find reasons and reason in a morass of difficult political controversy,” he said. Fried also remarked on Breyer’s polite demeanor. “His opinions on the court never indulge in any kind of sarcasm...or the dismissive characterization of the views of the other side,” he said. “There’s the total lack of any nastiness—he just doesn’t have it in him.”
According to others in his field, Breyer’s thoughtfulness is illustrated in the arguments and the often complex questions or hypotheticals that he poses on the Supreme Court. “His questions to lawyers arguing before the Court are masterful explorations of practical consequences as well as doctrinal distinctions,” Minow wrote.
Breyer’s intricate arguments are apparent in the numerous length dissents that he has written and presented. He wrote a 44-page dissent District of Columbia v. Heller, in which the Supreme Court struck down a D.C. regulation that banned gun ownership and upheld the right to keep and bear firearms for the purpose of self-defense.
Breyer is typically seen as a more liberal member of the Supreme Court, holding the belief that the Constitution is a “living document” whose broad language should be interpreted according to the changing needs of the country. Breyer’s most recent book, “Making Our Democracy Work: A Judge’s View,” explored the Supreme Court’s role in interpreting the Constitution.
On the topic of how to interpret the Constitution, Breyer explained in a NPR interview in 2011, "Much in the Constitution is written in a very general way. Words like 'freedom of speech' do not define themselves. Nor does the word 'liberty'...The application of those values changes as the circumstances change.”
Maintaining Ties 
 
Despite the fact that Breyer has not worked at Harvard Law School since 1980, he has maintained many friendships from his time there. Ogletree and Breyer have remained close, spending time together with their respective grandchildren. 
Dershowitz said that he and Breyer have been close friends for “half a century.” The night that Breyer was appointed to the Supreme Court, he came to Dershowitz’s house to celebrate. Dershowitz plays poker with Breyer from time to time as well, but said, “since he became a judge, he no longer bluffs.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Students crowded around televisions, and some even turned down dates, to catch a glimpse of a British quartet’s first performance on American television on February 9, 1964. Within days, all the record stores in the Square had sold out of their first shipments of their record, and at the COOP, the shipment of 40 was gone overnight. The Beatles took not only America, but also Harvard and the Square.
“You haven't heard of the Beatles yet? Go back to Lamont, wonk,” reads one article in the Crimson from 1964.
“The Beatles sort of eclipsed anything people were accustomed to listening to, and this was very much their selected music for parties, for dances, for whatever,” Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, who was a freshman at the College at the time, said.
 THAT’S ALL FOLK
Though the Beatles craze eventually caught on, Beatlemania was slow to spread through Harvard.
Michael A. Lerner ’65, a former Crimson editor, remembered in an email, a political world in which he lived and breathed The Crimson, and in which reporting on President Kennedy’s assassination, and writing op-eds on the Vietnam War was the focus. The world at Harvard, at least for the moment, did not revolve around the emergence of rock and roll.
Dingman remembered that “the music scene in the Square seemed to be around Club 47 [now Club Passim] which was largely about folk music.”
Merry W. Maisel ’62, who had been the folk music director for Harvard’s radio station WHRB, said that “folk music was the hottest stuff. That’s what was advanced, and [everyone] was a folk music fan. And so we had folk ‘music orgies’ in the studios [on Dudley street] and all the folk music singers in town would come and sing.”
“I remember Joan Baez sitting in a booth in a sandwich shop near me. I remember Andy Beyer [a former Crimson editor] playing the Righteous Brothers’ ‘You’ve Lost that Lovin’ Feelin’,’ and asking me to listen carefully, which I did,” Lerner wrote.
Maisel had graduated by the time the Beatles became popular on campus, but she recalls their less than positive reception at first. “The folks in Cambridge, at the Harvard radio station… thought the Beatles were horrid! In fact, I remember a friend of mine calling me up and saying ‘Beyettles!’ And I said what? And he said ‘Beyettles!’ And I said I’ve never seen or heard of them.”
She reflected that the Beatles’ initial Harvard reception is now surprising. “Harvard was as affected by the ’60s as any other place, and more so,” Maisel said. “And therefore the Beatles whom all these people now agree were the greatest musical innovators of the century should have had a better reception from us.”
THE BEATLES BREAK THROUGH ON ED SULLIVAN
The Beatles’ breakthrough happened the night of Sunday, February 9, 1964. Many viewing parties on Harvard’s campus were reported, including one where about twenty Crimson editors gathered in The Crimson's Sanctum to watch the Ed Sullivan Show.
Dingman recalled that the premiere was a momentous event. “All sorts of people who weren’t used to watching television were planning to see them on the Ed Sullivan show,” Dingman said. “You sort of picked up their songs everywhere you were going.”
Hendrik Hertzberg ‘65 remembered their performance on the Ed Sullivan as the beginning of an interest in rock and roll. “Everyone in the country under 30 was watching. I was a hard-core jazz fan at the time. Monk, Miles, Rollins. [I had] contempt for ‘hits,’” Hertzberg said. “But I was curious about these seemingly intelligent young Brits.”
To Dingman, the fact that they were from outside the U.S. appealed to many, as did the Beatles’ politically intriguing lyrics, youthful energy, and charisma.
“I think people just found something to attach themselves to in the music,” Dingman said.
 
Lerner reflected upon his attachment to the lyrics, as well. “I remember a young woman from Radcliffe with whom I fell in love. If 70 years of life has taught me anything, it is that love remains the most powerful force in life...That is what the Beatles were saying—that love is the greatest force,” Lerner wrote.
CHANGING TIMES
For many, the Beatles were a signifier of something new, and of changes in the cultural atmosphere.
“Like everything in pop culture, [the Beatles] were disdained by [kids] who were trying to get away from pop culture and be in some sort of elite…There was definitely a hangover of the ’50s,” Maisel said. “The Beatles on the contrary were something very new, and daring, and different, and therefore we didn’t catch on.”
Maisel remembered thinking how different they were from other pop and rock music, and she recalled the optimism and openness to the world that they signified.
“The Beatles had different rhythms and they had different tunes, everything was different. A symbol of what was to come,” Maisel said. 
Lerner also noted that the Beatles were part of a time of changing music tastes. “The ’60s and ’70s were a creative juncture of historic significance," Lerner said. "To be young in that period was a remarkable gift...This was a turning point.”
By early spring 1966, the Beatles were everywhere, remembered Hertzberg.
“‘Rubber Soul’ had been released a few weeks earlier,” Hertzberg wrote. “As I walked around the Square and the Yard, there was never  a moment when I didn’t hear a song from that album, ‘Norwegian Wood’ or ‘Run For Your Life,’ wafting through an open window.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard College prepares to permit gender-neutral housing, it is hard to fathom that just 50 years ago the College maintained “an open door and one foot on the floor” policy, formalized in 1952, that not only prohibited the women of Radcliffe College to visit Harvard men’s rooms during certain hours, but also dictated the specific nature of visits.
A little over a decade after the creation of parietal rules—defined at the time in the Radcliffe Redbook as ”the Harvard-Radcliffe term used for those hours during which students may entertain students of the opposite sex in their rooms"—deans became frustrated at the alleged misuse of these hours.
In a letter to The Crimson in 1963, Dean of the College John U. Monro ’34 stated that parietals were intended to create “a chance for men and women students to be together, and talk together, and enjoy each other’s company, in a private, quiet place, at no extra cost.” Instead, he wrote, they were being misused for “wild parties or for sexual intercourse.” 
Monro’s words disseminated across the national media, as the Associated Press and Boston newspapers covered the story. Sensational headlines and speculation soon followed, primarily highlighted by a piece in the National Enquirer, which published a tabloid that depicted the Harvard social scene as “orgiastic.”
Yet Monro’s stance, intended to uphold the mores of the time period, only ignited further rebellion.
“I still think that was a dumb stance by the dean,” said John A. Purvis ’64. “I think it really was a matter of indifference until the dean said that...We just considered it to be an invasion of privacy.”
Though students saw the ensuing campus uproar as an isolated event, decades later the 1960s would come to be known as a period of sexual revolution that launched not just Harvard, but the nation, into new moral standards.
MORES TO UPHOLD
To some College administrators, the customs of a previous generation were threatened by the behavior of students in the 1960s. 
“People are concerned about the unusual situation in which unmarried men are entertaining young women in what amounts to their bedrooms,” Winthrop House Master David E. Owen said to The Crimson at the time. “This is not an accepted procedure in the US or anywhere in the Western world.”
Many administrators and faculty found reason for concern, if not disciplinary action, with the abuse of the parietal rules.
“It is not appropriate for a Harvard student to entertain a girl in his own room,” said Dean of Students Robert B. Watson ’37 at the time. “It’s our positive duty to deal with fornication just as we do with thievery, lying and cheating, by taking severe disciplinary measures against the offenders.”
For Harvard, the national news coverage that the story generated was a public nightmare as deans did not want the College to appear lax in comparison to prevailing standards. 
“I do not want Harvard to play a leading role in relaxing the moral code of college youth,” Watson said. “We cannot have rules more liberal than a standard generally accepted by the American public.”
From a historical perspective, Elizabeth C. Ahern ’12, who wrote her senior thesis on Harvard in the 1960s, said that the scandal was given added attention due to the University’s status as an important national establishment.
"Harvard was seen as a storied institution,” Ahern said. “[Administrators] were charged, whether fairly or unfairly, with upholding the mores of the time."
As criticism mounted, Monro enlisted the help of University Health Services and Carl A. L. Binger ’40, a psychiatry consultant, to conduct a study on the sexual relationships between Harvard and Radcliffe undergraduates.
Dr. Graham R. Biaine, psychiatrist at UHS, contended that “undergraduates are not emotionally equipped to deal with sexual intercourse,” according to a Crimson article from the time.
The research, however, gained little traction among students. According to the article, “‘When you're in love, it's all right’ [was] becoming the new dictum.”
MORES TO BE BROKEN 
Students had grown to view parietals as a formality rather than a steadfast rule, and the administration’s concern seemed “antiquated” and “paternalistic,” according to Purvis. Current Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 called the system “a little draconian.” 
Monro noted at the time that students were pushing back on the College’s oversight. "When we talked to the students we found a prevailing attitude that what went on in the rooms during social hours was none of the College's business," he told reporters.
There was a sense that “the administration doesn’t get it, they’re too old school,” Ahern said, adding that the student’s of a new generation felt, “you’re an adult and you should be treated like an adult.” 
For many students, the administration’s response to the alleged misuse of parietals was delusional.
“The College authorities know we don't have girls in our rooms just to hold hands and do intellectual exercises, so they must approve of what we are doing,” one student said to The Crimson at the time.
In a 1963 response to Monro’s letter, Paul S. Cowan ’62 wrote in a letter to The Crimson about the differing student and administrative positions. “The gap between how the Administration thinks undergraduates act and how they really do act is presently too great for sensitive legislation,” he wrote.
At a university that most students saw as a bastion of forward thinking, the deans’ views seemed out of place.
“I guess we always thought of ourselves and the school as being progressive,” Purvis said.
“When Dean Watson made that statement it was a bit of a fish out of water in terms of our thinking of the place.”
TIDE OF CHANGE
After the debate that was sparked in 1963, parietals were soon eliminated, but not in the manner that administrators expected.
 The gap between students and the administration that was catalyzed by The Great Harvard Sex Scandal was exacerbated as the '60s progressed. On top of other student protest, in 1969,  then College President Nathan M. Pusey ’28 was forcibly removed by students from Mass. Hall as students protested the Vietnam War.
“Being a college dean then was like living in the public square of a small city inhabited by aliens,” Watson, who was also one of nine administrators dragged out of Mass. Hall, said in 1987. “There was no place to take refuge from the maddening crowd.”
To some, though Harvard students’ pushback against the administration’s parietal rules seemed like a singular event that minorly upset the College, in hindsight, it was the beginning of a transformative generational shift.
“We just considered it to be an invasion of privacy,” Purvis said. “But I don’t think we had the perspective that we have now about the ’60s being a decade of change.”
In 1971, a co-residency program was put into place, allowing men and women to live in the same dorms. For administrators today, the changes over the past 50 years have dispelled the fears that Watson, Monro, and other administrators of the time held about changing mores.
"When they went to having co-ed housing...the naysayers were imagining there would be all sorts of bad behavior but it didn't work out that way," Dingman said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
With the threat of the death penalty looming over him, John W. Perdew ’64 found himself sitting in a jail cell in Americus, Georgia the summer after his junior year at the College.
It was August of 1963, and Perdew had been arrested while protesting racial segregation with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, one of the organizations that staged sit-ins and freedom rides throughout the South in the 1960s. The charge under which Perdew and three other SNCC activists were being held was “incitement to insurrection”—a capital offense in Georgia at the time.
Perdrew remained in jail for three months, until a three-judge federal court declared the Georgia insurrection law unconstitutional on November 1, 1963, paving the way for his release on bail.
Although Perdew was unable to return to campus in time for the fall semester, news of of his arrest did reach campus at the outset of the 1963-1964 school year, a time when the civil rights movement was capturing attention across the University and across the nation.
Writers at The Crimson raised awareness of the Perdew arrest with news on the latest from Americus. Shocked students collected funds for Perdew’s legal defense. And University officials pressed the federal government to monitor the situation in Georgia.
Among the Harvard community, Perdew’s arrest was widely perceived as an injustice, and faculty and students mobilized to his defense.
AT THE FOREFRONT 
When Perdew left for Georgia in June of 1963, civil rights did not yet dominate the national political discussion and the country was two months away from the March on Washington and Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech.
Still, on Harvard’s campus, a sizable group of students was already actively following and participating in the nascent civil rights movement.
A white student born in Los Angeles and raised in Denver, Perdew signed up for a summer placement with SNCC in the South, after crossing paths on campus with John J. Hartman ’64, who had volunteered for the organization on weekends.
“[Hartman] said that he had gone to Cambridge, Maryland, where there was a very strong movement associated with SNCC, and that he had been to a sit-in and spent a couple of hours in jail,” Perdew recounted.
Perdew said he was excited at the prospect of actively participating in the movement that he had only watched from afar up to that point.
Underestimating the grave situation in the South, Perdew expected that his work with SNCC would only last the summer and that he would return to Harvard in the fall. However, his experiences with segregationist violence ultimately compelled him to take three years off from Harvard to campaign for civil rights. 
 
“I really had no idea how deep the hatred was—how thorough-going the segregation and the racial prejudice and the oppression—how complete that was, until I saw with my own eyes and was a victim of it,” recalled Perdew, who said he was considered a traitor to his race by many whites in the South.
‘IT WAS MY FIGHT’ 
Working in Albany, Georgia and later Americus, Perdew underwent considerable harassment from the state police, who followed him, interrogated those he talked to, and looked for grounds on which to arrest him.
“When I was driving, I had to be careful to obey every single stop sign,” Perdew said. “I had to give hand signals when I turned.”
Perdew and the other SNCC workers were finally arrested in Americus, where they held a meeting in a black church. Upon exiting, the activists found that law enforcement had surrounded the building.
“They had baseball bats, blackjacks, riot guns, and they were ready to beat heads, which they did,” Perdew said.
Perdew spent the subsequent three months in a jail cell with fellow activist Ralph W. Allen. Contact with their lawyers was minimal, and Perdew said he was genuinely fearful that a death penalty sentence was awaiting him.
“I remember one point early on in the three-month stay, I realized that the four walls were the physical limits of my world for who knew how long—and who knew what would be waiting for us at the end,” Perdew said. “So, for a long time, I avoided touching the walls and the door.”
Despite all that he had suffered, upon release, Perdew chose to remain in Americus for another year and continue SNCC’s work there. Perdew saw his decision to stay as a political statement—he was showing the community the determination, strength, and perseverance of the civil rights movement.
“[In jail] I had a lot of time to think about why I was there, why in the heck I had come to Georgia, what was going on, what I wanted to do about it,” Perdew recalled. “And I realized it was my fight, not just somebody else’s fight.”
‘THE WHOLE MOOD...CHANGED’
Perdew worked for SNCC in Georgia for three years, before returning to Harvard to complete his degree.
In the intervening years, he married fellow SNCC activist Amanda Bowens, a black woman from Americus. The ceremony took place in Perdew’s home state of Colorado, instead of Georgia, where interracial marriage was illegal.
To support his young family, Perdew returned to Harvard in 1966 to finish his degree. In line with national political trends, the University to which Perdew returned in 1966 was much more engaged with the civil rights movement than the University he left in 1963.
“[Between] 1960, when the first freedom riots happened, and my going back to Harvard, the whole mood of the country had changed,” Perdew recalled, adding, “there were many more students who were concerned about civil rights issues, who were aware of the protests.”
According to Howard L. Shecter ’65 and W. Bowman Cutter III ’64, much of the change on Harvard’s campus took place in the year following Perdew’s initial involvement with SNCC.
Shecter, Bowman, and many other Harvard students attended the March on Washington and heard Martin Luther King’s “I Have a Dream” speech that August. According to Cutter, across campus in the fall, students were closely following the progress of President Kennedy’s proposed civil rights legislation.
News of Perdew’s arrest in the fall of 1963 sparked action among students and administrators.
On October 7, 1963, the Kirkland House Committee voted unanimously to initiate a College-wide fundraising drive for Perdew, with a target of $6000.
John U. Monro ’34, dean of the College at the time, hailed the fundraising effort as “extremely important.” He feared that Georgia state authorities would seek the highest sentence for Perdew and fellow activists as a warning to other “outsiders” wishing to protest Southern segregation.
University officials also sought assurance from Solicitor General Archibald Cox ’34 that the Justice Department would monitor the developments in Americus.
According to Cutter, several students were also interested in traveling to Americus to protest Perdew’s arrest. But they soon decided that a fundraising drive for Perdew’s legal defense would be a more effective measure.
Playing upon the French word for lost, “perdu,” the fund touted the slogan “Perdew is not lost.” Shecter, who was a member of the Kirkland House Committee and a key organizer of the drive, collected funds from undergraduates in various locations around campus, from the Freshman Union to the Radcliffe Quad.
“I didn’t find people who said, ‘He shouldn’t have done what he did,’” Shecter said. “The sentiment was largely, ‘That should not have happened to him. He was doing something that should have been done a long time ago. It’s not fair. It’s not justice.’”
A few days after his release, Perdew spoke of his experiences to students in Lowell Lecture Hall on Nov. 4, 1963. He then learned of the fundraising campaign that had been launched on his behalf. Although Perdew was bailed out of jail before the drive ended, the funds did eventually go towards compensating his legal team, according to coverage in The Crimson at the time.
‘THE EDUCATION OF A HARVARD GUY’
Students at the College during the 1960s witnessed a moment when race relations in the U.S. were being renegotiated. For many, this instilled a lifelong sensitivity to racial politics and a commitment to furthering equality.
In an e-mail to The Crimson, Shecter described race relations as “one of America’s most intractable (and continuing) issues.” He credited his current understanding of that issue to coming of age during the civil rights era.
Similarly, Perdew has continued to advocate for social change, supporting endeavors to curb income inequality and poverty in his current home of Atlanta.
 
In 2010, he documented his life story, publishing a book entitled ‘The Education of a Harvard Guy.’ Proceeds from the book as well as its play adaptation went to support a mentoring program that he runs for urban youth in Atlanta.
“The title is meant to be an ironic statement,” Perdew said, referring to his book ‘The Education of a Harvard Guy.’ “Yes, I went to Harvard, but I also got an education outside of Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Harvard Union for Clerical and Technical Workers won recognition in 1988 after 17 years of efforts, many were uncertain about what relationship the University would have with the new union.
The administration of then-University President Derek C. Bok had previously  filed legal complaints questioning whether the original election by workers for the union was free and fair—something the National Labor Relations Board requires of such a process. When Harvard’s petitions were initially deemed invalid, Bok had an important decision to make—appeal the result to the NLRB or begin negotiating with the organizers.
Although Bok, who had previously taught labor law for over a decade, still contends there was a “technical case” to be made for pursuing an appeal, he decided against it after consultating a close friend and colleague. While the newly unionized crowd, largely composed of women, applauded what would appear to be their victory, uncertainty grew about how the union and its 3,600 constituents would be able to negotiate with the University.
Just one year later, HUCTW and the University would agree on a three-year contract that would be widely seen as mutually beneficial, with added benefits in terms of education, salary, and pension programs, among many other things.
During the negotiations, a powerful collection of experienced labor professors and intermediaries were able to form bonds with union leaders that many say successors have been unable to fully replicate. University representatives used creative means of negotiation and an “unusual” labor leader helped notch significant victories for Harvard workers.
Twenty-five years later, the nearly 4,800 members of HUCTW are still a force in University policy. Though recent years have seen the organization struggle to negotiate with the University, students, union workers, and faculty reminisced positively on their 1989 contract in what many deem to be one of the high points in HUCTW’s history.
CALM AFTER THE STORM
By 1988, the University had been contesting HUCTW’s formation for years, and workers believed the administration had conveyed an obvious sentiment against the union.
“Clearly [the University] didn’t want it,” said Maura Kilcommons, who has been part of the union since its inception. “They were trying to talk people out of it, but they weren’t breaking our thumbs or anything.”
After the NLRB affirmed the legitimacy of the union’s election, the University switched gears to work with
HUCTW rather than against it. Bok said over two decades later that he straightaway switched his focus towards  forming a close bond with the union.
“We really, in other words, changed our policy... We were no longer contesting the union, but trying to develop as constructive a relationship as possible,” Bok explained.
HUCTW members, energized from their official formation and eager to begin negotiations, welcomed the University’s change of heart.
“For the University, I think there was also a little bit of a feeling, certainly not on the surface but kind of lurking in the background, of wanting to make amends for the fact that there had been some pretty aggressive and hostile anti-union campaigning,” said current HUCTW director Bill Jaeger.
Bok quickly appointed his close friend and colleague John T. Dunlop, a former United States secretary of labor and former chair of the Economics Department, as the University’s chief negotiator.
With that, Harvard and its new union set to work preparing its first contract.
A UNIQUE APPROACH
Looking back, many involved in the first negotiations said it marked a new way that workers and employers bargained and embodied an even more significant philosophical shift in regards to the role of unions.
For one, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences professor Frederick H. Abernathy, a friend of Dunlop, described the “enormous diversity” of professions and differing priorities of unionized workers—with older workers focused more on retirement benefits and younger workers chiefly concerned with education and forming a long-term career—that made the task of negotiating initially difficult.
To deal with the wide variety of issues to be discussed, Dunlop created eight subcommittees and tasked each with addressing a specific topic of the intended contract, hoping to pinpoint workers’ differing concerns and ultimately resolve each of them in a specialized contract.
“All of this somehow or another led the late John Dunlap to decide we would have a contract unlike any other union contract,” Abernathy said.
Many HUCTW workers and student supporters attributed their close relationship with the University in their first negotiations to the philosophy set forth by Kris Rondeau, then-director of HUCTW.
“There was something very inspiring about watching that bottom-up organizing,” student advocate of HUCTW Noah M. Berger ’89 said. “It wasn’t about being critical of the employer, it was about the basic principle that work is important in people’s lives, what they do at work is important, and people have a voice in shaping their work lives.”
Rondeau was an “unusual union leader,” Bok said. “She made clear to me her objective was not to fight with the University, but try to achieve changes that would not only strengthen or benefit her members, but also make the University a stronger and better place.”
In the end, the contract took less than a year to finalize. The final product took the benefits package from “fairly good” to “world class,” Jaeger said.
While the union and administrators had seemed to have formed strong and constructive relationships, the “amazingly positive” results of the first negotiation were still surprising and unexpected, Jaeger said.
Though Bok said he did not receive much pushback from faculty or administrators, except for a confrontation in which he was accosted on the subway for his negotiations with the union, others said some felt felt uneasy about the finalized contract.
“Some lower-level administrators thought that John Dunlap had given them too  much in the way of wages,” Abernathy said.
A CHANGING DYNAMIC
When the three-year contract expired in 1992, the University climate had changed. Some of the key players in 1989 negotiations had left—Bok stepped down, Dunlap retired, and Rondeau left to work for the New England Organizing Project, an umbrella organization for several Boston-area unions including HUCTW. Without the strong leadership of the first negotiation present, HUCTW and the University struggled to sustain the strong relationship they had previously created.
“When it came time to renegotiate the contract in 1992, it was an  entirely different atmosphere than it had [been] the first time around,” said John Hoerr, a former labor reporter for Business Week and author of “We Can’t Eat Prestige,” which details the rise of HUCTW.
“There were people in the environment who thought the economic gains of the first negotiation were excessive and needed to be clawed back,” Jaeger said. “We had a very hard time in 1992 mostly just about economic issues, mostly just about where we were going to stabilize the raise program.”
After 1992, the relationship between the University and HUCTW gradually stabilized and negotiations remained cooperative for around a decade. But when the 2008 recession hit, pressures on the University to cut spending caused a return of tense negotiations as HUCTW tried to prevent job losses.
During the hardest economic years, HUCTW agreed to take pay raise decreases in accordance with spending cuts across the University. But when their contract expired in 2012, HUCTW experienced its “worst-ever” negotiations with the University, according to Jaeger.  As the economy recovered, HUCTW believed its members should be getting larger pay raises and more healthcare benefits, but the University claimed it was still hurting from the recession.
“[The recession] produced a kind of stress and frustration in the workplace, which has still really not gone away,” Jaeger added. “Those jobs haven’t really come back.”
Despite economic recovery over the past several years, HUCTW workers have noticed a change in University tone.
“It seems to me the Harvard administration in the last maybe 10 years just has sort of become increasingly corporatized or something,” said Donna Dickerson, a publications coordinator and HUCTW member since its founding. “There’s been a change in their willingness to engage in sort of bilateral discussions. There’s been a sort of hardening over the last few years.”
Jaeger voiced concern that HUCTW has not been getting its desired negotiation agreements because the University is under pressure to speed up growth in other areas such as online education, building in Allston, and the House Renewal Project. However, he suggested that the University doesn’t need to sacrifice worker interests in order to achieve its other goals.
“Our big slogan back in ’89 was ‘it’s not anti-Harvard to be pro-union.’ In the modern era, in 2014, we would say ‘it’s not anti-growth to be pro-taking care of the people in the core,’” Jaeger said.
While they say they have faced recent setbacks, many HUCTW members claim that the mission of the union and its approach to negotiations has remained constant over the last 25 year. Kilcommons, a faculty assistant at the Medical School, expressed optimism about the sustaining role of HUCTW.
“I think that might be the change—it’s no longer a struggling upstart—it has a very defined role, it has a defined culture, people know who we are, that sort of thing,” Kilcommons said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The lyrics from a Stevie Wonder song blared across Leverett House’s dining hall from a boombox while Aya de Leon ’89 and her friends listened to the words.
“I just never understood,” Wonder sang. “How a man who died for good would not have a day that would be set aside for his recognition. Happy birthday to you.”
It was Martin Luther King, Jr.’s birthday and de Leon had chosen the Wonder song to commemorate the strides the visionary had taken during the Civil Rights movement.
De Leon remembered a senior administrator approaching her friends and brusquely insisting they turn off the music, seemingly oblivious to the occasion.
Only a few hours later, the same administrator rapped on her door and proceeded to apologize profusely for his mistake, while de Leon stood in the doorway, laundry and clutter strewn around her room.
“It was one of those moments where I just felt deeply uncomfortable racially,” de Leon noted, recalling how vulnerable she felt.
The incident speaks to a wider trend on campus during 1988 and 1989. Many minority students felt marginalized by the University while administrators walked on eggshells, tiptoeing around racial issues.
Some student activists felt that the legacy of discrimination at Harvard before the Civil Rights era still loomed large.
But it was not only racial minorities who felt ignored by the University. Many women at Harvard College also felt marginalized. Radcliffe women had once been banned from Lamont Library and, according to the Radcliffe Student Union website, were required to clean the dorms of male students living around Harvard Yard.
Discrimination had taken a slightly more subtle tack by 1989. It was a glass ceiling that now prevented women from acquiring the most prestigious and coveted professorships or reaching the upper echelons of the faculty and administration. During 1988, the University began to make efforts to change the face of an administration still dominated by white men by making several strategic appointments to high profile positions.
Those efforts signaled to some that the University had begun to recognize the role that minorities ought to play at Harvard. Others claimed that the University had not done enough.
Harvard students rallied behind movements demanding change on campus, sparking a wave of dialogue and discussion over the treatment of minorities and women at the College.
OFF THE TENURE TRACK
Three decades had passed since the 1954 Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education, which desegregated American public schools and prompted sweeping civil rights legislation. The wave of reforms included the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited employment discrimination among other things.
Yet Harvard only employed a few faculty members who were either women or minorities.
By the end of the 1989 school year, The Crimson reported that only 1.8 percent of the 400 senior faculty were Black.
Minorities overall accounted for only 7 percent of the senior faculty. 8 percent of the tenured faculty were women.
The junior faculty displayed a slightly more diverse membership. Just over 12 percent of the junior faculty were minorities, and 27.7 percent were women. Even among undergraduates, no woman had ever served as a chair of the seven-year-old Undergraduate Council.
Some faculty members chose to challenge what they saw as a glass ceiling preventing them from entering the tenure track.
Barbara Bund Jackson ’66, for example, filed a suit alleging that the Harvard Business School had denied her tenure because she was a women. The U.S. Massachusetts District Court ruled against Jackson and she subsequently appealed the decision during September 1989.
According to court documents, HBS professor Gordon Donaldson originally testified that the Business School was hesitant to hire qualified women for prominent leadership positions.
“There’s a reluctance to accept women into certain leadership areas where traditionally they have not had such roles,” Donaldson testified. “I believe that business is one of those.”
The presiding judge eventually handed down an opinion that held that discrimination, while it may exist, was merely a reflection of pervasive stereotypes that the Court could do little to alter.
“Dean Donaldson’s statements, which the plaintiff portrays as evidence of discriminatory  intent, are merely a recognition that the general culture’s stereotypes and prejudices undoubtedly influence, albeit indirectly, the composition of the Harvard Business School student body and faculty.”
Jackson, however, objected to the prejudice adopted by Business School administrators and faculty, saying that it made her feel out of place while on the tenure track at HBS.
“It was not comfortable,” she said. “You were very aware that this wasn’t the tradition.”
The lack of women and minorities on the faculty may have dissuaded some qualified scholars from pursuing tenure. Wesley J. Paul ’91, an Asian-American member of the Minority Student Alliance, recalled that phenomenon.
He had a “bright, well-spoken, and highly thought of” teaching assistant who had expressed interest in pursuing tenure, but seemed reluctant because she was an Asian-American woman.
“I think she came to some kind of a realization that, as an Asian-American woman, her likelihood of getting onto the tenure track for Harvard or some other well-known law school was pretty slim,” Paul said.
MARGINALIZED AT HARVARD
Faculty members were not the only group to voice concerns about discrimination. Many minority students also felt that Harvard had not fully distanced itself from the discrimination that ran rampant before the Civil Rights movement.
When de Leon entered Harvard College as a freshman, she was unprepared for the sheltered upbringing of many of her peers.
She sometimes felt that she and other minority students were at Harvard to provide superficial diversity to the student body.
“In a lot of ways, we got the impression that we were there... to be a part of the diversity experience for the white students, that we were there as some kind of prop or set dressing, and that our needs weren’t the most important thing,” de Leon says.
Students at other colleges had demanded and received cultural houses that offered a space for minority students to gather and support one another.
Harvard, however, had yet to provide such a space, according to de Leon, who felt that the University did not appreciate the needs of the African American community.
Paul also felt that the the Asian American community was at the time misunderstood both on campus and across the nation.
“I do think there was a perception that Asian Americans don’t need any help, that they’re going to be fine, that they are generally fairly studious,” Paul says.
Jackson also noticed a subtle, if unconscious, disparaging attitude toward female students at the Business School.
“It seems to me that I was having lunch with one of the senior administrators, like a consigliere to the dean or something like that,” she says.
Jackson remembers hearing a senior administrator telling her over lunch that the school did not want to admit more women because it wanted to train the “leaders of the future.”
For de Leon, the exclusionary atmosphere was heightened by the limited course offerings at the College. De Leon remembers that when she first arrived at Harvard in 1984, the College offered only two courses about Africa and no courses on African languages.
According to de Leon, her high school offered a wider range of courses than Harvard.
“It was shocking to me that my public high school had better offerings in African languages than Harvard,” she says.
According to de Leon, Harvard focused instead on the culture and history of Western Europe—a disparity that made some students think that the University prioritized studying the West over ethnic studies. Thus, for minority students, even the course catalogue cemented the idea that Harvard paid too little attention to racial issues.
PLANTING THE SEEDS
Students rallied behind campus groups that demanded greater recognition for women and minorities from the administration.
Final clubs were the focal point of feminist discussion at the time. One group, Stop Withholding Access Today, embarked on a crusade to upend the male dominated clubs.
SWAT had been founded after Lisa J. Schkolnick ’88 sued the Fly Club for its male-only admissions policy, which she claimed violated Massachusetts prohibitions on discrimination by sex. The case continued into 1989.
Other feminist groups rallied for reevaluating campus security protocols after a woman was raped in her office.
Minority organizations—including the Minority Student Alliance, the Black Student Alliance, and the Third World Student Alliance—also sought greater representation on campus.
Paul remembers the Minority Student Alliance sitting down with various deans and administrators to have an open dialogue about increasing number of minority faculty members.
The group also focused on recruiting and mentoring younger members.
“I think it was a hope from our organization that we could plant the seeds for future generations of people who were involved in the minority community would sort of carry the flag forward,” Paul said.
Perhaps due to pressure from student groups, the University began to make changes to its policies regarding minorities.
In 1988, Harvard launched a review of Asian-American admittance rates.
The effort, sparked by a federal investigation that alleged discrimination against Asian American applicants, examined the disparity between white and Asian admissions rates, which over the past 10 years had averaged 17.0 percent and 13.3 percent respectively.
Student activists also began to call on Harvard to divest from South Africa, which was still operating under the apartheid system.
Their efforts prompted the Board of Overseers to elect Desmond Tutu, an Anglican bishop who led the anti-apartheid movement, in 1989, demonstrating its opposition to the apartheid regime.
Although University administrators claimed that would not succumb to student calls to divest, Harvard announced in April that its investments in South Africa fell from 230.9 million to 163.8 million during the last six months of 1988.
Additionally, Harvard appointed its first woman, Judith R. Hope, to the Board of the Harvard Corporation.
De Leon now says that her activism on campus has influenced her trajectory after Harvard.
She was a member of yhe Zealots in Protest, yhe Black Student Alliance, and the Third World Student Alliance. Although those groups failed to inspire sweeping changes to University policy, she still believes her work protesting the entrenched injustices at Harvard helped shape who she became.
“The people who were most affected by that campaign were those of us who engaged in it,” de Leon says. “I think about it in terms of the making of activists.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students were divided. House masters were conflicted. Associate Dean of the College of the House System Thomas A. Dingman ’67, however, was sure.
Starting in 1988, Harvard’s administrators debated a major alteration to the University’s House system. Originally created in the 1920s and later tweaked in the 1960s, the housing system was leading to “preppy ghettos” and racially imbalanced communities by 1988-1989.
Still, a group of House masters were reluctant to change the system. Dingman was only fully convinced change had to happen after reading a letter penned by a recent graduate, who wrote about the flawed House system.
The student, an athlete, had moved into an upperclassman House with everyone on his team—a common phenomenon as athletes were often assigned to the same House. The teammates spent every minute of the day together, practicing on the fields across the river, eating meals at the same dining hall table, and even attending classes together since they were all disproportionately studying economics.
As graduation drew near, the student noticed that his social circle had grown more and more insular. Looking back on the four years he spent at Harvard, the student wrote that he was disappointed that he got to know so little about his peers across the class.
“This made us wonder if we were really educating people for the lives they were going to have after college,” Dingman says. “We knew we had to change the system.”
Ultimately, the change would only be a temporary step in a process that would take years to conclude. But the debate over housing in 1988-89 represented one of many battles as an increasingly diverse University attempted to modernize.
HISTORY OF THE HOUSING SYSTEM
The debate embroiling campus in the late 1980s was far from the first surrounding the University’s housing system.
When then-President Abbott Lawrence Lowell structured and implemented the Harvard housing system in the late 1920s with the idea that each of the 13 Houses be a “microcosm” of the College, the elites complained about mixing with others, The Crimson called the plan arbitrary and disrupting, and freshmen were concerned about their future.
From the inception of the system in 1920 to 1967, the housing system was structured such that 75 percent of the entering upperclassmen were hand-selected by the House masters, while only 25 percent were randomly assigned a House.
“It was a bit scary to go and be interviewed by the distinguished old House masters,” remembers Howard M. Georgi ’68, the current Leverett House master.
The system was first modified in the late 1960s. It was a period of great student unrest and a time when students “did not trust any faculty, any administrators...or anyone over thirty,” says Biology professor John E. Dowling ’57.
The students demanded that the system change, leading to the creation of the ordered choice system, in which students ranked their top housing choices and received a lottery number that determined their assignment.
This system worked well and the Houses continued to be diverse and “essentially a microcosm of the College,” Dowling says.
It was not until the early 1980s that certain Houses began attracting specific groups of students, so that by the mid-1980s the College began to see certain groups of people in different Houses.
“That was disturbing,” says Dowling, who became the Leverett House Master in 1981.
“All the African-American students were in one or two Houses, all the gays and lesbians were in one House, and all those that either came from prep schools or thought they should have been coming from prep schools were in another House,” he says. “Then all the athletes were heading to yet another House, and the science concentrators to yet another House.”
A study done in 1982 found that African Americans made up 21 percent of Currier House compared to less than three percent of Kirkland and Eliot Houses. The study also showed that athletes made up just under half of Kirkland House, while they made up only five percent of Adams House.
“When I returned to Harvard as a post-doc in 1971, the old system had been swept away, and replaced by the pre-randomization system” Georgi says. “I think that this was a disaster for Eliot House. It had become a preppy ghetto, and I could not find the diversity of students that I had so enjoyed as an undergraduate a few years earlier.”
HOUSE MASTERS DEBATE
In December 1987, Dingman first mentioned the issue of House segregation in a House committee meeting, and in March of 1988 the House masters first debated the issue.
The masters were divided. Those that were against the proposed change argued that pure random assignment would “take away the real energy,” Dingman remembers.  They were worried that if, for example, a House that had been known for putting on theatrical productions no longer had this distinction, then no House would be able to mount anything of the sort.
“But we knew this wasn’t true,” Dingman says, “because a House at the time was winning the Strauss Cup—an award for intramural success—and this House had been randomly assigned… This same House was also putting on its own in-House musical.”
Other House masters, like Dowling, pushed for change.
“We think every House should be a microcosm of the College, and that the students can learn as much from one another as they can from us faculty. If it’s all the same in every House, it would really be a mistake...we would be negating what Lowell set up as the ideal House system.”
The students were also divided. Some thought that this “social engineering” would ruin Harvard, while others thought it would provide for a richer undergraduate experience.
According to Dowling, an Undergraduate Council survey showing mixed feelings on the issue helped encourage the House masters to move forward.
By June of 1989, the housing administration resolved that they had to adjust the lottery system, and the non-ordered choice system, in which students could list four choices but not rank them, was implemented on a trial basis.  The new system was the result of a compromise among some students who wanted to retain ordered choice and many House masters who insisted on fully random housing allotments.
HOUSING TODAY
In 1993, the House masters noticed that the Houses were continuing to have imbalances under the non-ordered choice system, and three years later, in the Spring of 1996, switched to complete randomization to promote greater diversity.
When the new procedure was first announced, 82 percent of the student body opposed the change.  Dingman says that in the year following the transition to complete randomization, “it was problematic, because if you were a House that prided yourself on being athletic, then those rising sophomores that now had no interest in athletics felt it was a funny fit.”
In quick order, however, “it was not a problem,” Dingman says.
House surveys showed that House system satisfaction rose in the years after the shift to random assignment.
“I think it’s a much better system,” Dowling says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although Kelly M. Dermody ’89-’90 would eventually become known as a prominent gay activist on campus, she began her college career feeling isolated and disempowered.
Harvard lacked a visible gay community or political framework to foster gay activism and Dermody, a star lacrosse player, was forced to grapple with her sexual identity on her own. There was no established network designed to provide support for queer students at the time.
“It felt like dropping off a cliff,” Dermody said. “I was really, really, really depressed and demoralized personally. It all felt like this huge deceit.”
Despondent, she took the following semester off to work for Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56 in Washington. It was 1987, during the buildup to the Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights, and the city was awash with renewed vigor for civil rights causes.
Dermody returned to campus, energized and ready to fight for gay community at Harvard. The charged environment had permeated the Harvard campus as well, inspiring a movement for heightened awareness of queer issues at Harvard.
“It was a crazy time to be in school, because all of that was percolating out there on the national landscape, and then on campus,” Dermody said.
The 1988-1989 school year was marked by a series of controversies over queer issues, which ranged from an alleged assault of a gay student to a renewed debate over ROTC on campus.
The developments fostered a more cohesive gay community, one that galvanized open discussion and activism.
“We had to come out, we had to help each other, we had to ask for the dignity that we wanted as opposed to waiting for someone to show up and realize it should be afforded to us,” Dermody said.
REFORMING CAMPUS CULTURE
Dermody recalled that Harvard at the time appeared to ignore queer concerns, sweeping them under the rug.
“As far as you could tell, no one talked about gay issues, [and] the absence of that dialogue meant people were very scared of being seen as gay,” Dermody said.
At the time, there were only two queer student groups on campus, the Bisexual Gay and Lesbian Student Association and the peer counseling group Contact.
Dermody and others felt that these groups did not adequately address the needs and concerns of the community. Harvard’s queer community lacked a “political arm” capable of creating changes on campus, according to Clarissa C. Kripke ’89.
Dermody and five other students, including Kripke, co-founded the political student group Defeat Homophobia to fill this gap.
Defeat Homophobia presented the administration with a list of demands. These ranged from the creation of courses on queer history and issues, to publicly identified, gay-friendly resources on campus, to University employee benefit plans that were inclusive of same-sex couples. The group also ran an awareness campaign about homophobia on campus and sought support from the Undergraduate Council for its goals.
The University would eventually adopt many of Defeat Homophobia’s suggestions later that year.
“I’m impressed with what we came up with,” Kripke said. “The agenda that we set out was a forward-thinking one—one that I think we largely accomplished.”
According to Kripke, the activities of Defeat Homophobia brought queer issues to the forefront of campus debates and discussions. Kripke noted that it became “the issue” on campus, a constant source of conversation.
A YEAR OF CHANGE
The spring semester brought a host of opportunities for Defeat Homophobia to continue its activism.
During a dance in Mather House in February of 1989, a gay student approached a high school visitor to the College. From there, the story blurs. Some claimed that the gay student was harassing the high schooler, while others alleged that the gay student had done nothing but talk to the visitor.
The gay student subsequently alleged that he had been assaulted by friends of the visitor.
Accounts of the incident are blurred and often contradictory, but the debate sparked by the event was clear.
Defeat Homophobia took the opportunity to spread its message, and staged a kiss-in where group members occupied Mather dining hall, kissing each other during Sunday brunch.
The protest also ignited intense debate throughout the House community and in Crimson editorials.
A few months after the incident at the Mather dance, the UC shocked the Harvard community by voting to ask the administration to reinstate the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps on Harvard’s campus. The University had kicked ROTC off campus in 1969 as a result of student protests related to the Vietnam War.
Kenneth E. Lee ’89, the UC Chair at the time, recalls that the initial debate largely revolved around the inconvenience faced by the approximately 90 Harvard students with ROTC scholarships at the time. Because of Harvard’s restrictions on the ROTC,  they were forced to commute to MIT to fulfill their scholarship requirements.
Student activists, however, were outraged, rallying in support of the ban on ROTC because the military forbade gay and lesbian people from enlisting.
Lee noted that the debate over ROTC gradually evolved to center around the controversial ban on gays in the military.
“It wasn’t until later in the debate that the focus shifted to the U.S. military’s discriminatory policies toward gays and lesbians,” wrote Lee in an email. “I think that shift changed a lot of people’s minds, including my own.”
Lee described the ensuing debate as both messy and chaotic. Some argued that the ROTC ban conflicted with Harvard’s anti-discrimination policy. Others said that it was “economic discrimination” to force students with ROTC scholarships to travel to MIT for training.
The UC ultimately withdrew its support from ROTC’s return to campus. However, the issue would drag on intermittently for years, until Harvard finally allowed the ROTC to open a campus office in 2012—once the military revoked “don’t ask, don’t tell,” a policy that forced gay members of the military to remain in the closet.
“That was the beginning of a conversation that took several decades to win,” said Kripke, referencing the recent defeat of the policy.
LOOKING BACK
Kripke noted that her experiences at Harvard taught her the importance of being true to herself.
“Part of what we were doing was practicing living our lives openly, honestly, and unapologetically,” she said.
For Dermody, activism in the gay community at Harvard was empowering, despite the struggles she faced.
“It had its hard moments, because shoot, we had to go to school, and we had to deal with that too, but it also had its great moments, so many incredible and powerful and human moments, that it definitely affected my path afterwards,” she said.
She now remembers Harvard fondly.
“I love Harvard,” Dermody said. “For all that adolescent angst and struggling with your issues, going through all your changes, with all of that, I really loved Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you’re a Harvard hockey fan, pay a visit to the Bright-Landry Hockey Center on any Sunday morning after the renovation crew moves out in the next few months. You may be treated to a reunion game with some of your favorite players, from Ed Krayer ’89-'90 to the Fusco brothers. Don Sweeney ’88 might even make an appearance.
Of course, there’s no guarantee that you’ll recognize any of them out on the ice. Well, except maybe one skater.
“We’ve all gotten a bit slower,” says former Crimson forward Andrew Janfaza ’88. Then he pauses.
“Except for Lane.”
Twenty-five years after captaining Harvard to the University’s first NCAA-sanctioned championship in a team sport, B. Lane MacDonald ’88-'89 is still the fastest guy on the rink.
The Crimson’s all-time leading goal scorer has maintained his seemingly effortless skating stride while smoothly transitioning into coaching, investing, and fatherhood. Yet his glide into Harvard Athletics lore was far from easy.
PLAYING THROUGH THE FEAR
As the Star Spangled Banner played, MacDonald felt an overwhelming sense of relief. He was standing on the ice with his Team USA teammates before their first game in the 1988 Winter Olympics.
“I still remember the tingles up and down my spine, kind of feeling, ‘Ok, I made it,’ after all the various issues,” MacDonald says.
MacDonald’s journey to the Olympics started with his Canadian father, Lowell, who played 13 seasons in the NHL before coaching Lane and his brother as prep school players in Milwaukee. Harvard coach Bill Cleary ’56, who had captured gold and silver medals for Team USA as a star forward in 1960 and 1956, also inspired MacDonald.
Realizing his lifelong dream, however, was not the only thing that made MacDonald emotional during the national anthem. Three weeks before the Opening Ceremonies, MacDonald had seriously considered withdrawing from Team USA.
The numbness. The loss of vision. The struggle to turn on a shower, button a shirt, or remember a name. MacDonald experienced traumatic migraines and concussion-like symptoms throughout his college career, and the symptoms only became worse as MacDonald deferred his senior year at Harvard to train for the Olympics.
“There were times when he was visibly shaken,” Janfaza recalls, “and next thing I know he’s back on the ice performing at a really high level.”
MacDonald continued to stun defenses as he quietly played through the increasing fear of worsening symptoms. In Calgary, Team USA missed the medal rounds with a seventh-place finish, yet MacDonald finished the tournament tied for the team lead in goals with six in six games, including two strikes in a tight loss to the Soviet Union.
MacDonald reached a new breaking point, however, after he experienced symptoms in his first game back at Harvard the next fall. He credits the University’s resources for helping him finish his final year in a Crimson uniform.
“I really got to the point where physically and emotionally I was just a little exhausted, just in terms of all the worries, all the fears,” MacDonald says. “Fortunately, I was in an environment like Harvard where there were people like Bill Cleary, [assistant coach] Ronn Tomassoni, and [former Athletic Director] Jack Reardon [ ’60] who could help with some of these issues.”
Top Harvard neurologists monitored MacDonald’s condition, and a resident sports psychologist helped MacDonald. With the fastest man in college hockey back on the ice with new confidence, the Crimson had all the pieces in play for a championship run.
AN UNQUESTIONED LEADER
MacDonald proceeded to dominate the NCAA in his final year. During the season, he broke Harvard’s all-time marks for career goals, power play goals, and shorthanded goals and led the Crimson to its first Beanpot win in eight years with an MVP performance. At the season’s end, he became Harvard’s third and most recent athlete to accept the Hobey Baker Award as the nation’s top college hockey player.
“He was just so smooth,” says John Connolly, a longtime college hockey writer for the Boston Herald. “He was like an NBA player who you just know is going to cash in that three-point shot when he gets the ball. He would just get the puck in the goal, and [it was] effortless.”
MacDonald made his high expectations for his last season clear in his first team meeting as captain, yet he preferred not to give rousing locker room speeches. Rather, he inspired his teammates with humble leadership and an indomitable work ethic.
“Lane was the consummate captain,” says former Crimson defenseman Scott Farden  ’88. “He led by example and nobody worked harder than him, nobody was more selfless. When the best player is also the hardest worker, everyone else tends to fall in line, and that’s how he led. Lane was our unquestioned leader.”
Reardon, who traveled frequently with the team during the 1988-89 season, noticed MacDonald’s ability to connect with the underclassmen and communicate with Cleary.
“Basically, it was like having another coach out there,” Reardon says. “Lane helped keep everybody together all the time.”
In the national championship game, MacDonald put Harvard up on Minnesota midway through the second period with a classic MacDonald goal. Gathering speed up the wing, he split a pair of defensemen and threaded a low shot between the pads of opposing goaltender Robb Stauber.
Later, an overtime goal from Krayer would cement MacDonald’s place in Harvard history. After all the fear and doubt, the captain could finally celebrate.
“People jump off the bench, throwing gloves, piling on people, and you have the emotion of having achieved,” MacDonald says. “The chance to share it with 25 people who sacrificed, fought, and worked together for a long period of time with one objective—rarely in life do you get that one group of people.”
CAPTAIN CONSISTENCY
MacDonald currently lives with his wife, Wendy, who played college hockey for Cornell, and his children: Catherine, 13; Ben, 10; and Madeline, 8.
After graduating cum laude out of Kirkland House with a degree in economics, MacDonald turned down NHL opportunities because of health concerns and played briefly for a Swiss professional team and the U.S. national team. He came back to Harvard as an assistant coach for the 1990-91 season and with Janfaza founded the Crimson Hockey School, a summer program they ran for 10 years.
MacDonald also dabbled in broadcasting, serving as a hockey analyst for TNT’s daytime coverage of the 1992 and 1994 Olympics.
Yet MacDonald found his ultimate vocation in investing. Janfaza feels that the same characteristics that made MacDonald a successful captain have made him a successful businessman.
“He’s had great success in business and has accumulated a wealth of knowledge,” Janfaza says. “He is very thoughtful, and people like him and trust him to make good decisions.”
Earlier this year, MacDonald left his new post as Harvard’s Managing Director of Private Equity after five years with the Harvard Management Company to become president of Crosby Advisors—a small group of investors that handles the wealth of Fidelity Investments chief Edward C. Johnson III ’54 and his family.
“It was an incredibly difficult decision to make,” MacDonald says. “I really love Harvard Management Company.... I felt like you were there to make money for a great cause, particularly for admissions and financial aid.”
MacDonald recently finished his term as President of the Harvard Varsity Club. He coaches his son’s team, and he plays non-contact pick-up games with former teammates and a collection of older and younger alums from other hockey programs on Sunday mornings.
According to Janfaza, MacDonald can keep up with the 25-year-olds. In the last quarter century, not much has changed about MacDonald, from his conditioning to his character.
“I’ve seen most of the body of work, and he’s been so consistent for so long at such a high level,” Janfaza says. “He never surprises me.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Long before the days of shiny smartphones or high-speed wifi, Kenneth C. Griffin ’89 was trading bonds from his Cabot House dorm room between economics classes.
It was 1987 and one of the only ways to receive updated portfolio information was by setting up a satellite dish to receive stock quotes. Griffin had convinced Cabot maintenance to rig a dish on the roof, winding cables through a window and elevator shaft, down a hall, and into his second floor dorm room.
The entrepreneurial student also raised $265,000 from family members and friends to finance the investment scheme.
Although his fellow Cabot residents might have deemed the endeavor a bit unusual, Griffin said it was not all that uncommon.
“The great thing about Harvard is there’s such diversity in the student body and so many students are doing really fascinating and interesting things,” Griffin said. “In the context of Harvard, this story wasn’t exceptional.”
Although Griffin downplays the Cabot investment scheme, he has since received widespread acclaim for his exceptional track record as a hedge fund manager.
Griffin is now the chief executive officer of his very own private equity firm, Citadel Capital, a company that oversees $19.6 billion in investments. In 2013, he was among the youngest members of Forbes 400 wealthiest Americans, holding his position at 103 with a net worth of $4.4 billion.
Earlier this year, Griffin gave a $150 million gift to Harvard—the largest single gift in the history of the College.
Griffin now says the three years he spent at Harvard helped foster his passion for investment and commitment to philanthropy
ALL BUSINESS AT HARVARD
Today, as entrepreneurial tech geeks have entered the national spotlight through hit blockbuster films and HBO series, Griffin appears to exemplify one of those success stories.
One of his freshman year roommates, George J. Juang ’90, recalled how he immediately realized that Griffin possessed an acute knowledge of management and economics.
“He was already very intense and a savvy businessman as a freshman,” Juang said.
Even before he started trading stocks out of his Cabot dorm room sophomore year, Griffin had already helped launch another business.
During his senior year of high school, Griffin founded EDCOM, a company that provided low-cost educational software to professors.
According to Juang, the company dominated a large portion of Griffin’s time during his freshman year.
“He was on the phone all the time with his manager,” Juang recalled.
During business transactions, Griffin strove to maintain a mature persona and to avoid flaunting his young age.
Griffin told the Fort Lauderdale newspaper, Sun Sentinel, in 1986,“Do you think anyone would trust their product line to a 17-year-old kid?”
Although Griffin attempted to assume a professional attitude, he did not appear different from his peers, Juang said. The freshman roommates still had a relatively normal year that included plenty of partying and socializing.
“He was a hardworking, fun guy to hang out with,” Juang said. “Nobody thought of him as being above anyone else. He was an ordinary undergraduate.”
AN EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE OF A LIFETIME
Griffin still says his years at Harvard were formative, teaching him how to tackle everyday challenges and grapple with political questions.
Amid floods of fond memories, Griffin reminisced on a class he took with Richard E. Neustadt, a legendary White House advisor and historian, on the power of the American presidency.
According to Griffin, Neustadt, who died in 2003, used to invite students back to his house for dinner, drinks, and political conversations. It was those conversations that Griffin now remembers as some of the best he had at Harvard.
“I can’t remember if Richard was in his seventies or older at that time, but as the night wore on, he showed all that he had us beat in every dimension,” Griffin said. “[Neustadt was] just a brilliant thinker and he could outdrink all the freshmen.”
Although Neustadt was known for advancing liberal political dogmas, Griffin developed a conservative streak. According to the New York Times, Griffin has donated large sums of money to Republican candidates, such as Scott Brown and Mitt Romney, and conservative Super PACs like American Crossroads, the brainchild of Karl Rove.
Griffin has also focused his philanthropic efforts on his alma mater, donating to Harvard several times over the years. He made headlines last fall when he contributed the record-setting $150 million to the College, stipulating that about $125 million would go to fund financial aid.
“It sets a marvelous standard of generosity and also a standard for financial aid giving,” University President Drew G. Faust told The Crimson earlier this year.
Last week, Griffin lauded previous donors, whose generosity helped make his Harvard experience so memorable.
“When you walk into the doors of Harvard, you just look across the yard and you look at the names of the buildings,” Griffin said. “You realize that people helped make what you and I enjoyed a reality because of  their hard work and willingness to give back to the University.”
Griffin has now joined the ranks of alums who have helped shape the lives of so many students.
For him, the proveriable adage about education lasting a lifetime rings true. His experiences at Harvard have fueled a desire to remain immersed in the life of the University.
“Being part of the Harvard community is a lifetime experience. And over my lifetime, I really look forward to being continually involved with both the administration and faculty, but more importantly, the students who comprise the student body and the Harvard community,” Griffin said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lowell Common Room was pitch black. The audience shuffled. Instruments fell silent and the music began. Alternatively dissonant and melodic chords rose and fell, interrupted by meditative poetic passages.
Alan Gilbert ’89 had just entered Harvard College as a freshman. He was playing the violin that evening, performing an experimental piece that juxtaposed the chamber music “Quartet for the End of Time” by French composer Olivier Messiaen with the lofty poetry set “Four Quartets” written by T.S. Eliot.
“He was so totally committed to the music, very unselfconsciously absorbed,” said Yun Soon Lee ’87, who played piano in the quartet with Gilbert that evening. “He projected a very natural confidence and authority based on his musicianship.”
Gilbert has now served as director of the New York Philharmonic for the last five years, honing a reputation for unexpectedly intermingling the symphony with other artistic forms.
He has managed to define a cohesive musical philosophy that relies on technical proficiency while approaching the complex, and often unfamiliar, landscape of modern music.
Today he says that the years he spent at Harvard profoundly shaped how he approaches musical performance at the Philharmonic by encouraging him to take risks while maintaining technical exactitude.
A YOUNG MUSICIAN AT HARVARD
Gilbert estimates that he participated in about 100 productions over the course of his four years––one for about every week he was on campus.
“We had to do everything ourselves, so resultantly we were always putting on concerts,” he said.
Gilbert also used his time at Harvard to develop his eclecticism. Already an experienced conductor as well as a violinist, Gilbert was constantly asked to conduct works by a slew of known and more obscure composers.
“The range of things was really impressive,” he said.
Harvard ultimately fostered a unique community, which Gilbert acknowledged could verge on pretentious.
“It was extremely highbrow and unbelievably austere and pretentious,” Gilbert said. “It would only have happened at Harvard.”
Although the Harvard music scene could be overly highbrow at times, it offered Gilbert a chance to pursue a wide range of academic and musical opportunities.
A conservatory, on the other hand, would have offered a more focused path.
“If I want to be able to experience a broader liberal arts education and spend time around people who would be exploring all different fields of inquiry, the time to do it was right after high school,” he remembered thinking.
According to Gilbert, the music faculty was instrumental in inspiring and challenging him by encouraging him to broadly examine the music he studied.
Lee, now a professor of English literature at Wellesley, painted the faculty at the time as worthy of immense respect, but also remarkably open. Gilbert also respected his former professors, particularly the composer and faculty member Earl Kim who mentored him.
“[Kim and I] would become beautifully obsessed about the smallest detail in a piece of music or a sauce that he was making for his food,” Gilbert said. “The kind of aesthetic delight that he embodied is something I think about to this day.”
Although Gilbert formed strong bonds with professors like Kim, some of his fellow students thought he was aloof. Justin Davidson ’87, who is now a music and architecture critic for New York Magazine, took several classes with Gilbert and was initially surprised by his persona.
“You have this idea that conductors have natural charisma and physical grace,” Davidson said. “Alan in college was quiet and somewhat aloof.”
Even Gilbert jokingly admitted that he might have rubbed fellow students the wrong way.
“I remember being unbelievably confident––even annoyingly so––about my approach to music,” Gilbert said. “I was probably kind of insufferable.”
THE DIRECTOR
As musical director of the Philharmonic, Gilbert has departed from the orthodoxy of predecessor Lorin V. Maazel to craft challenging and contemporary programming.
“I’m still figuring out how to allow musicians to be fully themselves while remaining true to myself,” Gilbert said.
While acknowledging that there is room for continued growth, Davidson lauded the current state of the Philharmonic.
“The Philharmonic––and I never would have said this ten years ago––is one of the more modern orchestras.”
Davidson praised the maestro’s daring choices, highlighting how Gilbert has  mounted a performance of Stockhausen’s intricate “Gruppen” in the booming Park Avenue Armory, presented a staged version of Ligeti’s “Le Grand Macabre,” and collaborated extensively with visual artist Douglas Fitch ’81.
Gilbert was forced to be creative since the number of patrons willing to buy subscriptions to the Philharmonic has dwindled in recent years, creating a need for constantly engaging content.
According to Davidson, Gilbert has managed to generate the interest among New Yorkers that the Philharmonic needs to thrive.
Gilbert’s genius, Davidson suggested, lies in his ability to generate widespread enthusiasm with his ingenuity.
Describing how New York has responded the programs crafted by Gilbert, Davidson said, “something interesting is going on at the Philharmonic––and it isn’t just another Mahler concert!’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
On March 21, 2013, an overlooked, undersized Harvard men’s basketball team took on the highly-touted third-seeded University of New Mexico in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. After 40 minutes of play, the Crimson busted the vast majority of March Madness brackets, taking the favorites down, 68-62. The victory was the team’s first-ever postseason win, advancing it to the third round of the Big Dance. Two days later, however, a talented Arizona team took down the Crimson, handing it a 74-51 defeat.
Months later, when the curtains opened on the 2013-2014 season, Harvard was one of the few NCAA teams whose postseason successes were more memorable than its disappointments. Following the upset victory, expectations for the Crimson were as high as they’d ever been. A program that hadn’t won the Ivy League until 2011 had votes for the AP Top 25; one ESPN expert even picked it for the Final Four.
The Crimson’s season followed the script. Although Harvard dropped its two big road contests—against Colorado and UConn—it was without key players in both games. Against lesser opponents, Harvard took care of business; the team went 26-2 against non-tournament teams and 13-1 against the Ivy League. Its 13-point average margin of victory in Ancient Eight play made it the league’s strongest champion in a decade.
For the Crimson’s efforts, the Selection Committee awarded Harvard with a 12-seed and a date in Spokane, Wash., with the Cincinnati Bearcats. Pundits made Harvard a popular upset pick. CBS analyst Seth Davis made Harvard his “upset lock of the day” and President Obama selected Harvard over Cincinnati in his tournament bracket.
The game was gritty. The Bearcats’ bruising style, which prioritizes long bodies that choke passing lanes, stymied the Crimson offense. Co-captain Laurent Rivard kept the team in the game with a barrage of three-pointers, and Saunders’ defense on Cincinnati senior wing Sean Kilpatrick eventually broke the game open. When the game clock hit zero, the underdog’s 61-57 upset was complete, and Harvard was Cinderella once more.
And so the Crimson found itself in a familiar place: back in the third round of the tournament, and facing a team that was considered bigger, quicker, and more talented than the Ivy League representative.
This time, Harvard was matched up against perennial powerhouse Michigan State—the preseason No. 2 and a consensus favorite amongst experts, Vegas, and the President to win the national title.
It was a matchup of David and Goliath, and, at least for the first half of the game, Harvard and Michigan State’s performances matched what the brackets had predicted. Thanks in large part to the above-the-rim play of Spartan junior forward Branden Dawson, Michigan State took a 12-point lead into intermission. The opening 20 minutes saw a surfeit of Harvard turnovers, Spartan fast breaks, and Dawson alley-oops, recalling for the Crimson memories of the Arizona blowout from a year prior.
However, a change in momentum spurred by an emotional halftime speech from Crimson co-captain Brandyn Curry would prove the game far from over.
What follows is an oral history of the Harvard-Michigan State third-round matchup. The Crimson, which was considered down and out before it even took the court, was playing on the biggest stage in program history. The Spartans, which had reached the Sweet 16 in five out of their last six campaigns, were looking to avoid being the latest giant toppled in a tournament replete with upsets. What ensued was 40 minutes of play that truly typified the madness characteristic of postseason collegiate basketball.
In the 20 minutes prior to intermission, the heavily-favored Spartans painted the key green. Michigan State tallied four dunks and four layups in the opening half, scoring largely off of Harvard turnovers and the ensuing fast break opportunities. Dawson spearheaded the Spartans’ play, notching 20 points in as many minutes. When the buzzer sounded signaling the end of the first half, the Crimson found itself down, 45-33, and just 20 minutes away from ending its season in a manner similar to how it had ended 2013: in blowout fashion.
Siyani Chambers (guard, Harvard): At the beginning of the game, we weren’t as prepared as we should have been. We came out, we were taking forced shots, we weren’t getting back on defense. Their speed and transition game surprised us in the first half.
Laurent Rivard (forward, Harvard): I don’t think we had played a team that athletic, especially [Dawson], their power forward, [all year]. They were so fast. They’d rebound the ball and [Dawson] would be out leading the break…. They knocked us back on our heels.
Tommy Amaker* (coach, Harvard): They put us on our heels right away and then...put us in a big deficit and a big hole.
John Ezekowitz ’13 (attended game in Spokane): The first half felt like it went by in a blur. It mirrored how fast MSU was playing the game.
Steve Moundou-Missi (forward, Harvard): I thought, ‘Here we go again like last year,’ We were [so] happy to be there that we were [emotionally] drunk, and lost sight of why we were there—which was to compete.
Tom Izzo* (coach, Michigan State): We played so well early; one turnover in the first half is a record for us.
Julian Benbow (writer, The Boston Globe): [Those opening minutes] were unbelievable…. [F]or a second, you see Dawson getting anything he wants in terms of layups.... They were contested, but he just jumped higher. He just kept going up. You kind of thought [Harvard] was going to get run out of the gym.
Vince Lackner ’72 (former Harvard player, attended game in Spokane): MSU had some pretty amazing interior passing that let them split through our defense. It struck me as a higher level of basketball than we had ever encountered.
Dan Shaughnessy (columnist, The Boston Globe): The way the game started you really thought “Oh boy, here it comes”.... We were working on a deadline, and I was deep into a “they are overwhelmed, they are outclassed” story.
Christian Webster ’13 (assistant coach, Harvard): The big thing we wanted to focus on coming in was transition defense. A lot of people don’t give [MSU] credit for how they get up and down [the court], and they were able to do that. That’s how we dug ourselves in a hole. You can’t turn the ball over against guys like that.
Rev. Jonathan L. Walton (traveled with team to Spokane): I was depressed, I was stressed out, we were all kind of stressed out.... It felt like it was turning into a dunk contest. 
Mitchell L. Dong ’75 (attended game in Spokane): Everybody was like “Oh my God, it’s a fluke that we are here [in the Tournament].”  We thought we shouldn’t be there. It was just playing out our nightmare in reality.
David Tannenwald ’08 (freelance writer covering Harvard basketball): I was at John Harvard’s [Brewery & Ale House], and [the first half] was a little bit tough to watch, but also it didn’t feel devastating.... There was a sense—and I think Brandyn said this in a postgame interview—that [Harvard was not playing] its best basketball…. You don’t want to have a performance like that on the biggest stage of the year.
Down 12 and 20 minutes away from elimination, Harvard headed into the locker room at halftime with heads low and emotions high. For the seniors, the mentality was now or never: if the Crimson didn’t step up its play soon, their collegiate careers would end on a familiarly sour note—on the wrong end of a lopsided contest. Curry, in particular, felt that something needed to be said in order to change the direction of the game. So he stood up in the locker room and began to speak.
Moundou-Missi: When we got back to the locker room, everybody was mad, everyone was really upset about the way we had played. We knew that a similar thing had happened the previous year [against Arizona], and we knew that [if] we were going to lose again, we were going to lose while competing and competing hard against a really tough team.
Chambers: It was pretty serious [in the locker room]. Guys really wanted to win and we went after each other. We knew what it was going to take and we knew we had it in us, we just had to get it out of each other, and so it was pretty heated, pretty intense.
Moundou-Missi: I remember coming into the locker room, everybody is really quiet, and their faces are really telling of what the situation is. They were outplaying us, clearly, and we were all sitting there and Brandyn as a captain stood up, and the first thing he said is “We do not lose like this. We are not going to lose this game like this.” At the time, everybody’s faces were down, and after he stood up and said that, everybody looked up to him…. It was really emotional, it was a really powerful speech.
Chambers: It was a really serious talk. Brandyn [discussed] how we can be better and how we know that we can be better, and how we had to go out there and show it. It really got us motivated to go back out there and prove to ourselves and prove to everyone else that we’re not an underdog team, and we can actually compete at this level. All we had to do was go out there and play like we know how to play.
Webster: [Curry said] we are not going to look intimidated like we did in the first half.
Brandyn Curry* (guard, Harvard): [It] being my last game...I told the guys that we just need[ed] to fight. We were down in a big hole, and I felt like the first half wasn’t us out there.
Ezekowitz: There was a feeling at halftime that this is a bit like what happened against Arizona, [but] that if we can throw out a run in the first five minutes of the second half, there’s a chance. It felt like the odds of a comeback were low, but it didn’t feel like last year when there was no chance.
Moundou-Missi: The previous year we got our asses handed to us by Arizona, and that wasn’t something we were trying to have happen again.
Despite Curry’s speech, the beginning of the second half saw results similar to those of the opening period. With 15:43 remaining in the game, Spartan sophomore guard Gary Harris sunk two free throws to extend his team’s lead to 16, 52-36. The Harvard fan section was silent, while the Michigan State cheering section was raucous. However, a pair of three-pointers by Curry in a 30-second span shifted momentum from the favorites to the underdogs.
Webster: We always say take it four minutes at a time with the media timeouts. We feel like [if] we can win every segment, then we can win the game. We tried to chip away at it four minutes at a time. We tried to win every segment from then on out once they got up big. We tried to focus on taking it four minutes at a time and being persistent and not doing more.
Moundou-Missi: [Curry’s halftime speech] is why at the start of the second half we had a different mentality coming in. You could see it right away, we were a lot more aggressive, we just weren’t scared to confront those guys, whether in the post or at the perimeter. It was a different mindset in the second half.
Ezekowitz: When the comeback started to happen, it wasn’t an immediate thing in the second half. Brandyn made a couple of threes and then it started. There was a sense of build ing—that we didn’t play our game in the first half. The Harvard team that fans had seen all year didn’t show up in the first half, [but began to in those early second-half minutes].
Benbow: They understood that they were in a hole and they also understood that they were not going to go down laying down.
As the game clock ticked under 12 minutes, Harvard quickly narrowed the gap. Coming out of the under-12 TV timeout, Saunders drove to the basket, drawing the foul on Spartan senior guard Keith Appling. After two made free throws, Harvard fell back into a press. Curry forced an errant pass from Harris, and Saunders deflected the ball into the hands of Moundou-Missi. With Moundou-Missi sprinting up the court, only Michigan State sophomore Denzel Valentine stood between the junior and the basket. The junior went over, not around, the Spartan—throwing down a two-handed dunk that cut the lead to four. What was a blowout was then, suddenly, a battle. 
 
Moundou-Missi: All I remember is Wes deflecting the ball and it was about to go out of bounds. I don’t think I’ve ever run that fast actually, but I saved the ball and I got control of the ball. The only thing I thought about was how the lane was wide open. One defender was coming and he stopped right before the block, and I remember [thinking], “Okay, I’m going to dunk the ball. I’m going to dunk over him.” I rose up and he kind of cleared the lane, and I just went for the dunk—that was it.
Chambers: That was another [big] play. [Momentum] had been on our side, and we just needed a few fast break points to show that we could stay in it.
Moundou-Missi: The only time that I heard the crowd really loud was after that steal. As I dunked it—I almost missed it—I looked over to the other side and saw [former Harvard co-captain] Oliver McNally [’12] going wild, the entire crowd was wild, and that’s when I realized how big [the play] was…. I was dead tired because Kyle was down [with fouls], and [Amaker] only played five guys for the longest time…. [At that point], I was in a rhythm. It just felt natural.
Tannenwald: That was amazing. John Harvard’s was going pretty crazy…. In the second half, they played exceptional basketball. [Moundou-Missi’s dunk] was a powerful moment. [Throughout the game], there was not a sense of panic. In the first half, it felt like they were a little overwhelmed by Michigan State’s athleticism, but I think in the second half what struck me the most is that they looked like any really good college basketball team in the country that was making its run.
Benbow: I think Dan [Shaughnessy] and I were both looking at each other like ‘We are going to have to rewrite our stories.’ Moundou-Missi ran into the [press] table and some girl [spilled] a coffee and we had to clean this up and we were on deadline with coffee all over the place. It was a crazy game.
On the next Harvard possession, a tip-in by Moundou-Missi brought the Crimson within two. The next time down the court, the team went to its junior forward again, who was blocked on the ensuing layup attempt by Spartan sophomore forward Matt Costello. But as Costello prepared to throw the ball upcourt, Saunders intercepted the pass. Two dribbles and he was at the rim, dunking the ball home and tying the game for the first time since tipoff. With nine minutes to go, the game was tied at 55.
Chambers: At that point [of Saunders’ dunk], it was all about needing buckets, quick buckets, and getting another stop on defense. Wesley and Steve’s dunks both came on fast break points, which is what we were trying to get. We were trying to get open shots at the rim…. [Our mentality at that point was to] just keep doing what we were doing: working, getting the stops, giving up one shot only, getting the rebound, pushing it up the floor, and trying to get quick, easy buckets at the rim.
Moundou-Missi: [Right before the basket], I got blocked. I didn’t really see it—I turned my head, and [Saunders] was dunking the ball. That was it. I remember it being a big moment, the crowd was so loud, and we were tied.
Adreian Payne* (forward, Michigan State): We knew that they were going to go on a run. Coach kept talking to us and telling us that they [had done] this before.
Walton: It started trending on Twitter that Charles Barkley said at one point “Michigan State has to decide if it is going to match Harvard’s physicality”...and someone put that on Twitter with the line “This is the first time that this has ever been said about Harvard.”
Michigan State responded to the shot as favorites do, by launching a haymaker. In this case, it was Harris draining a three from outside and finding Dawson two possessions later for a layup. Four free throws, two apiece from Chambers and junior forward Jonah Travis, had brought Harvard within one when Curry stole the ball from an unsuspecting Dawson. Running on the break once more, Harvard had the Michigan State defense where it wanted it—in disarray and with nobody on Rivard. Seeing his co-captain alone in the corner, Curry rifled a pass to Rivard, who waited in front of the Harvard section. The fans were on their feet as the shot left the senior’s hands, and jumping in celebration as it splashed through the net. 62-60. Harvard.
Rivard: I was really excited. At that point. I hadn’t hit a shot yet. [After that basket], we had all the momentum.
Chambers: That was a really big shot in the game. It was a big play. All we needed was a stop after that. [Without that] shot, the game would’ve been a lot different. I think that shot put a lot of pressure on Michigan State to make a play after we did.
Dong: From the ashes we rose. That was one of the most amazing feelings I’ve ever had as a sports fan. I watch a lot of sports, but going from being down by 16 to up two was unbelievable. Crazy.
Gary Harris* (wing, Michigan State): We knew they were going to make a run, because they [were] here for a reason.
James Jones (coach, Yale): People don’t believe that [Ivy League teams]  are as good as we are outside of our conference. Last year, New Mexico acted like they did not know who Rivard was, and they didn’t respect him from that level. I don’t think teams at that level respect [his abilities], and I think that hurts them.
Moundou-Missi: Laurent has the ability to always hit the big shot. He is always at the right place at the right moment.... Every time he shoots the ball, we expect it to go in. You can see the entire bench rise up, with three fingers up, always. When he hit that, I was like “Here we go, we have a chance to win this game.” It was a really big moment, a big change of momentum in the game, but it was also a big statement overall that we can compete as an Ivy League team against those power conference teams.
Lackner: [Watching Rivard at that moment] was almost like watching a Babe Ruth or Roger Maris attacking the home run record. Every time he tees it up there is an air of anticipation because more likely than not he is going to make it.
Dong: The fans went berserk at that point, when we caught up and actually went ahead. I’ve never cheered so loud and been such a crazy fan. [McNally] and everybody that was there were completely going berserk.
Tannenwald: The single [word] that comes to mind is “crazy” at John Harvard’s…. You just felt like you were watching a great college basketball game, you didn’t think “Wow, there’s this anomaly, this Ivy League basketball team.” You actually forgot the name on the jersey at that point.
Trice: The thing we knew was that no matter what happened, they were not going to give up—they proved that tonight. When we got up big, they kept fighting.... That’s a great team.
But ultimately, Michigan State responded. Following Rivard’s basket from deep, Spartan junior guard Travis Trice drilled a three to put Michigan State ahead for good. From there on out, the Spartans maintained control, and minutes later, clinched the 80-73 victory. While the matchup with Michigan State ended in bittersweet feelings rather than in a bid to the Sweet Sixteen, Harvard players and students, alums and reporters all share the sentiment that the team’s success in the 2014 Tournament was not a one-time occurrence, but rather was a sign of a program on the rise.
Webster: That [Trice three] is everything.... If we get a stop there, it changes everything. [If we had] come down with the ball there and with the momentum we had and with everyone in the arena going for us, there is no telling what happens. If we score, we put game pressure on them, which they had not had in a while. If we could’ve done that, it could have changed it all.
Webster: I have never seen a locker room that distraught. For an Ivy League team to come that close—I know people at Harvard were shocked, but we thought we were good enough and capable enough to make the Sweet Sixteen. We were going into the game not trying to keep it close, but to win.
Tannenwald: Harvard more than held their own, they had every reason to believe that they could win that game in the second half, and Michigan State is one of the top teams in the country. So I think that game was the biggest difference maker [for Harvard’s reputation]…. Going into the Michigan State game, frankly, I was less optimistic [than I was about the Cincinnati matchup]…. But after watching the game, there was this feeling like “Wow, this could’ve happened.”
Moundou-Missi: I think every year we take another step…. We want to keep on moving and do better than we did the previous year, and that’s the goal for next year—to see if we can break through that third round.
Dong: Obviously, [Harvard] is great in lots of academic areas, and we’ve had great achievements athletically, but being in March Madness in basketball, it really brings the community together…. I think we’re not an anomaly, we’re not a one-trick pony, I think this is the sign of a legend.
Tannenwald: I think that Harvard was one of the top 30 to 35 college basketball teams in the country. I think they were a really, really good team. I know this is going to sound crazy, or not that crazy, but I actually think it’s possible for Harvard to make a Final Four run at some point in the next five years. My thinking is if George Mason can do it, then there is no reason to think that Harvard couldn’t do it. There’s no reason to think that Harvard can’t be a Gonzaga of the Northeast.
Andy Katz (reporter, ESPN): The Crimson [is] a legit national player. There should be no reason Harvard shouldn’t consider itself in play for a bid every season and at least one win in the NCAA tournament.
Chambers: [The Tournament run] shows that not only ourselves, but the Ivy League is a league to be reckoned with, and people overlook us, but we’re able to compete with the best of them. Even though we’re a mid-major school, we’re talented enough to go out there and play with some of these top schools.
Tannenwald: In the second half, at the end, it was just two good college basketball teams going at each other. And maybe that’s the bigger point. How good was Harvard? It’s hard to say with specificity, but they were a very, very good college basketball team.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Robert A. Lue has a full plate these days. On any given day, the professor of the practice of  molecular and cellular biology can be found working on projects in one of three campus offices or traveling the world as a spokesperson for the “Leading In Learning” initiative of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ ongoing capital campaign. Richard M. Losick, Lue’s co-professor for the popular course Life Sciences 1a, remembers a time when he could drop into Lue’s office at random to chat. Now, he says, it is “almost impossible to find him” on a whim.
Lue’s rise within Harvard’s growing pedagogical bureaucracy has been swift, and his increased prominence comes hand in hand with the University’s rapid, if uncertain, embrace of technology-informed attempts at innovation in the classroom. Since 2004, when he was appointed director of Life Sciences Education at the College, the popular biology professor has been named the inaugural faculty director of the Harvard Allston Education Portal, of HarvardX, and of the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, respectively.
“I am a different type of faculty member,” says Lue, who is not a tenured member of the Faculty. “I like occupying a space that is sort of in between so many things, because it gives me enormous flexibility to explore.”
That flexibility, Lue says, offers the opportunity to set the pedagogical agenda for much of FAS, even if, as Lue’s colleagues say, it also carries the risk of getting lost in buzzword-laden generalities. At the highest level, Lue envisions a school that employs the rigor of academic research to understand how ideas are exchanged and breaks down many of the inherited teaching methods that have long dominated Harvard’s classrooms.
With hundreds of millions of dollars in capital campaign funding set to flow into the initiatives he oversees in coming years, that vision is poised to be put to the test, as Lue tries to make concrete a charge that is as unsettled as the technology it attempts to harness. In short, the man who colleagues call the archetypal 21st century professor is trying to lead a 377-year-old research university onto the pedagogical cutting edge.
 
‘A NEW HARVARD PROFESSOR’
 
Today, in addition to advising his own undergraduates, Lue oversees the tutoring of youth in Allston, the training of Harvard’s faculty and graduate student teachers, and the creation of massive open online courses broadcast to students around the world. But when he began his career at Harvard in the late 1980s as a Ph.D. student in molecular and cellular biology, Lue knew only that he wanted to teach.
Daniel Branton, a biology professor emeritus and Lue’s mentor, says the biologist’s proclivity for teaching was apparent early in his graduate years.
“Right from the start it was very clear to me that he would be a very good teacher; he just loved the profession,” says Branton, for whom Lue worked as a teaching fellow.
By his fourth year in the program, having served as teaching fellow for every semester, Lue taught his own seminar on HIV and AIDS. And after completing a postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard in 1996, he signed on as a lecturer in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, deliberately giving up academic research and the tenure track in favor of teaching–a decision that would define his career.
“You have to decide what it is you are going to emphasize,” Lue says, adding, “I realized, what I’d really like to do is to focus on teaching and learning and bring that same sensibility [of academic research] to the process of teaching and learning.”


Today, Lue considers education his field of academic-style research even if he does not have an education degree, and a field that he calls “remarkably challenging.” He treats his classroom as a laboratory and an early testing ground for the methodological experimentation he hopes to scale to the University-wide level–and, in the case of HarvardX, far beyond.
“[Students] are very different from yeast or cells growing in a dish that we can do stuff to and that generally behave in predictable ways,” Lue says. “Human beings in the context of a Harvard class are very complicated, unpredictable.”
This spring, Lue says he conducted an experiment in his class, MCB 54: “Cell Biology,” to challenge traditional course structures that score students based on a midterm and a final. Instead, Lue replaced both exams with six 20-minute “In-Class Evaluations,” or ICEs, spread out over the course of the semester.
“We discussed at the beginning of the semester the idea of changing the way students are examined from this ancient system where you tend to have a lot of focus on midterm and final,” says Vladimir Denic, Lue’s co-professor for MCB 54. “The idea is that a lot of students cram for those types of experiences and then their retention is not very high afterwards.”
Its results aside, the experiment is classic Lue, similar in objective to the globally successful cellular visualization his team created in 2006, which dynamically engages students to better understand course material. Lue’s commitment to the classroom—Losick says that Lue lectures from the aisles rather than talking down from a lectern—has translated to a well-remarked popularity among students and consistently earns Lue Q guide scores over 4.0.
Colleagues say projects like the cellular visualization are exemplary not only of Lue’s intellectual ability, but also of his ability to combine disciplines and find methods for improvement outside of the traditional professorial toolbox.
“Many of us, we burrow into our departments and our own research projects, and he’s wired differently,” says English professor Elisa New, whose course Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding 12: “Poetry in America,” was adapted to HarvardX this spring. “He is able to see over time places where innovation is ready, is ripe to happen, and where he can be effective in coaching and nursing it along.”
‘LEADING IN LEARNING’
On an evening in the middle of April, Lue stood beside Vice Provost for Advances in Learning Peter K. Bol as he gave an interactive talk about Chinese folklore to a group of Allston residents gathered at the Education Portal. About 75 or so residents watched in the room, but Bol’s lecture was also broadcast live to HarvardX viewers around the world as part of a new initiative bridging the online platform and the University’s physical outreach efforts. As Bol delivered his lecture, questions streamed in from the both the audience in front of him and the one connected digitally across globe.
“We’ve seen from the very beginning with HarvardX that it’s an online thing, but we’re trying to encourage more in-person interaction to bring the community together,” Lue said at the event.
The night is just one recent example of how Lue is trying to bring together the various projects he oversees. Like his own classroom, HarvardX and the Bok Center each offer Lue both a venue for research and a venue to apply it. Data gathered from the thousands of students taking HarvardX courses around the world is folded into conversations with information from in-person evaluations of teaching fellows and techniques at the Bok Center. Lue and his team help make sense of the information and apply it to the Bok Center’s training programs and the HarvardX production studio.
“It’s really all about learning,” Lue says. “How do you support learning in very different audiences, how do you use a variety of very different tools, how do things that you learn from the life sciences and approaches in the life sciences really sort of have cross-cutting impacts on other fields?”
In terms of his time, Lue says he splits his days between working with undergraduate students and advisees, helping faculty develop curriculum and courseware, and sharing programming ideas and materials with University outsiders in the world of higher education. And as an advocate for capital campaign initiatives, Lue is often pulled away from campus to expound on his vision for teaching and learning at Harvard.
Denic, who says he and Lue used to run through entire MCB 54 practice lectures for feedback before the semester began, says he thinks of his co-teacher as a “benevolent dictator,” who has brought a centralized vision of education to a diverse field of educators.
For his part, Gregory Nagy, a Classics professor whose course Culture and Belief 22: “Concepts of the Hero in Classical Greek Civilization” has been adapted for HarvardX, says Lue is not so much a “boss” as a facilitator.
“What Robert Lue practices, it’s more like a musical instrument than a weapon, the ability to coordinate the energies of such a wide variety of people as Harvard represents,” Nagy says, “[A] community that is diverse as Harvard is...takes a special kind of person to bring it about.”
But for all their praise, colleagues interviewed for this story had more trouble pinning down Lue’s role and the tangible implications of his vision. Lue himself describes his role as catalyst, visionary, executive, and leader at various points in two interviews, but ultimately settled on something like a “lead facilitator.”
“Someone who basically opens doors, that helps people think about what they need, that can think about resources and help the institution think about what resources are needed for innovation,” Lue says, describing his account of education research.
“There’s so much in teaching and learning that we don’t know,” Lue adds. “It’s kind of a little bit of a wide-open landscape for exploration right now.”
STRETCHED TOO THIN?
Lue quite often spends his nights at an apartment he rents in Harvard Square instead of commuting 25 miles north of Cambridge to his home in Andover, Mass.
“Nights were getting extremely late,” explains Lue, who says that before renting the apartment, he used to spend nights at hotels in order to make 8 a.m. meetings with faculty members and colleagues.
The change evinces the increased workload Lue has taken on in recent years. As his titles have accumulated and the scope of his projects has expanded, Lue says he has kept his roots in the classroom.
“Of course some folks say ‘You're completely nuts,’” Lue says. “Life is intense. Harvard is a place where we live maximally.”
Though most of Lue’s colleagues interviewed for this story say they are confident in his ability to steer one of FAS’s most attention-grabbing endeavors, some wonder if his leadership is sustainable. Lue himself projects that the Bok Center will more than double the size of its staff and open an additional outpost in Allston with funding from the FAS capital campaign.
“One person can be spread too thin,” says Chair of the Committee on General Education Edward J. Hall. “Maybe he has enough energy to handle these things fine, but that’s obviously a general worry, not just particularly about Rob.”
Lue himself acknowledges that the workload can be challenging.
“Do I feel spread too thin?” he says. “Some days yes, but who doesn’t? You also have to think about balance. What is the personal investment and sacrifice that you need to make in this?”
Still, Lue says he has no plans to relinquish any of his positions.
“You have to realize that you don't do everything,” Lue says. “There’s an organizational framework for how these things work, where you have sort of a series of tiers of basically, an organizational structure that allows you to do your job.”
For Lue, having this structure in place for the various organizations he oversees means he is not limited by the particulars of any one class or discipline and can connect ideas and tools already in use with those made available by emerging technology.
“I create a primordial soup, rich complex, nascent ideas and, from that, hopefully I foster,” Lue says, his rhetorical tone characteristically aloft.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the current president of Consent, Assault Awareness and Relationship Educators, and someone directly involved in teaching a sexual assault workshop to incoming freshmen, Demetrio D. Anaya ’15 is well-acquainted with what he believes are deep-rooted misconceptions about sexual violence held by his peers.
"When you get started, you think you're going to walk into a room and teach them about sexual assault, and you're going to change everyone either from indifferent on the issue or neutral on the issue to being huge supporters of sexual assault [prevention], and you quickly realize that to make that kind of change in an hour workshop is almost impossible,” he said.
This difficulty is indicative of a larger problem. Even as Harvard appears to stand on the cusp of changes to its sexual assault policies—University President Drew G. Faust said in April that the University has submitted a revised policy to the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights—activists and administrators alike say that the next hurdle, which is related but perhaps more daunting, is changing a culture that propagates the normalcy of sexual violence and mistreatment of its victims.
SETTING THE STANDARD
In early May, the U.S. Department of Education released the names of 55 colleges and universities across the country, including Harvard, facing federal investigation for failure to comply with Title IX regulations. The announcement came weeks after students at the College submitted a complaint regarding Title IX compliance to the OCR at the Department of Education and four years after federal officials began investigating Harvard Law School for another complaint, a process that is still ongoing.
Across the University, student activists, such as those involved in Our Harvard Can Do Better, a survivor-centric organization that aims to dismantle rape culture on campus, have pointed to the inclusion of affirmative consent, the standard of evidence used in sexual assault cases, and the standardization of procedure across schools as policy changes the University could enact to comply with Title IX while improving sexual assault response and prevention.
A similar conversation has attracted attention on a national scale, culminating in the formation of the White House Task Force to Protect Students From Sexual Assault and public condemnation of its prevalence on campuses from President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and other high-profile politicians and celebrities. In late April, the OCR released a 53-page document on handling Title IX complaints.
That document suggested, among other changes to its policy, that Harvard should replace its current “sufficient persuasion” burden of proof in Administrative Board cases to a “preponderance of the evidence” standard, believed by some to be a lower burden of proof than the standard Harvard current uses.
That discrepancy between Harvard’s policy and what activists see as obvious improvements has provoked outrage, mirrored on other campuses, in a number of forms. Just this year, Our Harvard Can Do Better representatives protested and held signs, including one which read “My friend’s rapist goes to class with me,” as prospective students walked by during Visitas, the College’s admitted students preview weekend.
When University President Drew G. Faust announced the creation of a task force in many ways designed to galvanize a cultural awareness shift, she made clear abiding by governmental regulations is not the only thing at stake.
The recommendations of the task force, which Faust accepted in mid-May, suggested more prevention training during freshmen orientations, increased funding for the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, and funds for a campus climate survey.
“[Legal] obligations should not alone define Harvard’s commitment to providing an educational environment in which all students have the opportunity to thrive,” Faust wrote at the time of the task force’s creation.
BEYOND THE POLICY
While policy considerations have largely driven the national conversation, and, it appears, the administration has taken—or is prepared to take—concrete steps related to sexual assault, many point to Harvard’s culture as a more fundamental source of problems related to sexual assault.
“Policy is great for policy's sake, but we need to be thinking about...how we can make our community safer and make it clear to everyone in the community that these are our beliefs and this is the kind of community we want to live in,” said Anaya, who is also a member of the sexual assault task force convened by Faust in April.
Emily M. Fox-Penner ’17, a lead complainant on the complaint filed by undergraduates in April, and other activists agree and add that the University should do more to effect change in that culture than they do now. In other words, she said that policy and culture are “mutually reinforcing.”
For example, recommendations by University officials and police that students walk carefully or wear certain clothing—suggestions that would more broadly be characterized as risk reduction factors—can place undue responsibility on victims, Fox-Penner said.
Alicia Oeser, director of OSAPR, notes that there is “definitely” a culture of victim blaming at Harvard and nationwide.
Although Anaya agrees that it is important for schools to redress their policies, he likewise said that the broader conversation about the culture behind sexual assault will require more than policy changes.
THE ‘CULTURE PROBLEM’
Jack C. Smith ’15 first heard about Harvard Men Against Rape, a subdivision of OSAPR, from upperclassmen members of Sigma Chi when he rushed the fraternity in the fall of his freshman year.
Through his experiences as a member of HMAR, a group that aims to foster an open dialogue among males about sexual violence and how it affects their own lives, Smith said he has realized the importance of male involvement in changing the culture around sexual violence.
“The ‘culture problem’ as I see it can best be summed up by the fact that, although we know that a very small number of men commit the vast majority of rapes on campuses, they still largely act with impunity,” Smith wrote in an email.
Organizers from Our Harvard Can Do Better emphasize the power dynamics at play in exclusive social spaces such as final clubs, saying that regardless of where students choose to go on campus, they have the right to be safe.
Despite attempts to contact all presidents of male final clubs, each either declined to comment or was unreachable.
Sharon L. Howell, outgoing resident dean of Adams House, said that the power dynamics at play on campus mirror the “larger culture” in which Harvard is embedded.
“I think it’s disappointing that there is still so much power imbalance in the social scene,” she said. “As someone who deals with student issues regularly, that’s very clear to me.”
And while groups such as Our Harvard Can Do Better, CAARE, and OSAPR bring up these common overarching themes as concerns when dealing with sexual assault, some say that a wide range of cultural forces that often have little or nothing to do with alcohol and social clubs factor into this situation.
Jennifer A. Sheehy-Skeffington, a Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment tutor in Winthrop House, pointed out the danger in isolating the different factors contributing to sexual violence. She said that, in her own experience as a SASH tutor, issues involving sexual assault combined with alcohol use or Harvard’s social scene do not typically come up.
“The most common thing to come up in my role as a tutor is just issues of blurred boundaries and the legitimacy of feeling uncomfortable about something that doesn't necessarily fit a category of sexual assault or sexual harassment,” Sheehy-Skeffington said.
The complications she described point to the continuing difficulties in dealing with what she described as a “continuum” of cultural factors, a problem that many are combating by increasing awareness.
CLIMATE CHANGE
Earlier this May, Winthrop SASH tutors took over their house's dining hall during dinner and passed out a survey asking students to report expectations they had about their own social lives. Included were questions ranging from opinions on the definition of “sleazy” to the number of sexual partners a student would like him or herself to have had before finding a lifelong partner.
“For that whole dinner, everyone was discussing all of these issues and debating them,” Sheehy-Skeffington said. “The aim was less to see the results and gather information than to start those conversations.”
Through these discussions, peer counselors and faculty and staff members involved in sexual assault awareness hope to educate members of the Harvard community about the cultural components of attitude toward sexual assault.
With regard to education, Anaya emphasized two main solutions: changing the casual way we use language associated with sexual violence and employing the practice of bystander intervention as a community.
“Once you get the ball rolling, this is a topic that people quickly realize is something that they can be a part of changing,” Anaya said.
Even the people tasked with advising students may not be aware of best practices, Sheehy-Skeffington explained.
“My experience, and anecdotally, is that people will come [and] talk to the tutor that they know best about these issues, and that won’t necessarily be the SASH tutor,” she said. “ The tutor they talk to needs to be trained in how to respond to that issue, and they're currently not.”
While no one interviewed for this story claims that the task at hand is an easy one, students, staff, and administrators still express optimism at the prospect of a shift in the cultural environment around sexual assault awareness.
And culture-oriented measures are already going into effect. In addition to exercises such as the one in Winthrop, each male final club participated in bystander intervention training this year with OSAPR, according to Oeser.
Steven E. Hyman, former University provost and chair of the task force launched by Faust this spring, said that he and his colleagues intend to use the widespread wave of attention to the issue to make a lasting change.
“The goal is not to issue a document that makes us all feel good; the goal is to make a difference,” he said.
Fox-Penner and Our Harvard Can Do Better, though highly critical of University policies, seem to agree on this point.
“I think that there really is hope in terms of getting changes to take root that will go a long way towards changing this campus,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a first-year student aspiring to study computer science, Anne W. Madoff ’15 felt at times that she had the weight of her gender on her shoulders.
“At most, you would see 30 percent women in an [engineering] classroom, often less—you could be in a section where you were the only girl,” Madoff said. “I would feel tremendously scared to ask a question, because I would think if I asked a stupid question, I would make girls look bad.”
Madoff said that she has since overcome that fear, one that she said commonly weighs on female undergraduates studying engineering, computer science, and related technical fields at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, where two-thirds of all concentrators are male—a ratio that has stayed constant even as the school has doubled in size since 2009.
According to Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons '67, this lopsided ratio among those interested in science and engineering fields accounts for a portion of the growing gender gap among the students admitted to Harvard. 55 percent of students admitted to the College this April were male, meaning that nearly 200 more men than women may graduate with a College degree in 2018.
Amid ongoing efforts by administrators and students to decrease the size and effects of the gender gap in SEAS classrooms, questions remain regarding Harvard’s ability to address the gender disparity in its fastest-growing school.
PARTING THE SEAS
As the University allocates substantial resources to SEAS, skewed gender ratios have persisted within the school’s student body, a trend that is highlighted by SEAS’s remarkable growth and reflected in the mass of students applying to Harvard.
With SEAS slated to receive $450 million out of the University’s total $6.5 billion goal in its recently launched capital campaign and projects already underway to expand the school’s facilities into Allston, many have hailed SEAS as a new front for Harvard's liberal arts education.
But compared to other fields of study at the College, the gender imbalance in SEAS concentrations is particularly large. In the last five years, the number of female concentrators in SEAS has ranged from 31 to 34 percent, with statistics of the 2011-2012 concentrator breakdown suggesting that the percentage is even lower in computer science and the branch of engineering sciences that awards S.B., rather than A.B., degrees.
This 2-to-1 ratio of males to females has persisted during rapid growth of SEAS in recent years. Since 2009, the school has experienced a 137 percent increase in undergraduate enrollment, according to data provided by SEAS’s executive director of communications Paul Karoff.
The growing ability of SEAS to attract and retain students already at Harvard—as demonstrated by escalating enrollments in classes like Computer Science 50 and Engineering Sciences 50—can account, in part, for this growth in enrollment. But the rise also stems from increased interest in engineering, technology, and related fields among students applying to college. This year, the Admissions Office saw a 60 percent increase in applicants who said that they were interested in studying computer science, said Fitzsimmons.
Rising application rates from these students can produce gender imbalances in applicant pools, as demonstrated by the 10 percent gap in male and female students in the College’s incoming class. This proportion mirrors admissions trends at schools with the nation’s premier engineering programs. The class set to graduate in 2017 at Stanford and MIT is 53 percent male and 55 percent male, respectively. At the California Institute of Technology, the class of 2017 is 62 percent male.
These imbalances, however, defy general trends in higher education, in which women have represented the majority of college students in the United States since 1979, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. In 2012, the agency reported that women constituted 56.8 percent of the nation’s college students.
PRESSURES IN THE CLASSROOM
SEAS community members across its hierarchy have raised concerns about the lopsided gender ratio at SEAS and its impact on classroom dynamics and the ability of the school to draw talent across the student body.
SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray said that she believes that the gender gap is hindering both the school and the fields of science and engineering more broadly.
“We need the best minds, and a lot of those minds are not choosing the hard sciences and SEAS,” Murray said in an interview in April.
With far fewer women than men in the SEAS faculty as well as in its student body, Murray said SEAS is extending job offers to a greater number of potential faculty members who are women. Her goal for faculty recruitment is to be “fifty-fifty,” although she noted that its achievement will “take a while.” Ultimately, she added, the goal is to attract and recruit students who would otherwise concentrate in a non-STEM field.
Meanwhile, students in engineering and applied science concentrations point to problems in the classroom that result from the gender gap.
Ida B. Hempell ’14, a concentrator in applied mathematics, said that she has often worked on projects in which she is the only female in the group.
“There is a sort of pressure on me not to make mistakes, and if I were to make one or two lapses, I would not be taken as seriously,” she said.
Hempell added that the lopsided ratio of males and females at SEAS can deter female students from enrolling in the school, where she said they may not feel “ as welcome.”
Similarly, Anna Papp ’15, an engineering concentrator, said that she is sometimes self-conscious about group projects, which are increasingly prominent at SEAS.
“I’ve been concerned that maybe guys would not want to work with me,” Papp said, adding that despite her concerns, she has not encountered that problem.
Julie R. Macdonell ’14, a computer science concentrator, said that the male skew in SEAS can reaffirm stereotypes and, at times, isolate female students.
“There is definitely this ‘brogrammer’ culture as you move up in the CS Department,” Macdonell wrote in an email, noting that most of her close friends study the humanities or social sciences. “I’m not making any sort of judgment on that culture, but I do think it makes it more difficult to find your niche as a female CS concentrator.”
She wrote that the gender gap is most noticeable in advanced classes such as Computer Science 124, a course on data structures and algorithms. When she attended office hours for the class, all other students at the session, as well as the teaching fellow, were male. 
“It’s not a threatening feeling by any means, but I can definitely say that I feel a lot more comfortable working on problem sets with women and getting help from female TFs,” she wrote.  “The TFs I have had who are women tend to have more encouraging and nurturing demeanors.”
Macdonell said that “different behavioral patterns” between male and female students during office hours, with male students sometimes pursuing answers to their questions more aggressively than females, call for changes to classes, sections, and office hours. 
Other students, however, said that the gender disparity does not impede their interest nor pursuit of an engineering degree. 
Meisha B. Brooks ’14, who concentrates in mechanical engineering, said that she does not believe that gender diversity in SEAS is a concern that warrants administrative action, and that her interest in engineering was not hindered by the school’s gender imbalance. 
“I definitely do not think it needs to be addressed,” she said.
Madoff, who co-founded Harvard Women in Computer Science, an organization that promotes awareness about and opportunities for women in technical fields, said that despite her initial concerns, her experience as a computer-science concentrator has been “extraordinarily positive.”
BRIDGING THE GAP
Across SEAS, administrators, faculty, and students have worked to address the persistence and impact of the school’s gender gap, though the success of these efforts is difficult to measure. 
Murray attributes part of the gender imbalance, along with disproportionately low representation of students of some racial minorities within SEAS, to variation in students’ academic backgrounds. According to Murray, even if an undergraduate starts at the introductory course Math 1a, the student can still succeed in one of the school’s engineering concentrations, a possibility that she said may not exist at other engineering schools.
“If you don’t happen to have a good math background, which is often what happens to women and underrepresented minorities more so than, let’s just say, white males, then you have a disadvantage for starting in engineering,” she said. “I want to make that disadvantage go away.” 
 
Computer Science professor and former Harvard College Dean Harry R. Lewis ’68 said he would like women to continue to become more integrated in computer science and that he has been supportive of efforts to do so, such as by working with WICS.
According to Madoff, several faculty members in computer science—the largest concentration in SEAS—recruit female teaching fellows for their course staffs. In turn, the increased presence of women in technical fields can help encourage other women to join, said Amy M. Yin ’14, a computer science concentrator who co-founded WICS with Madoff.
“I think in general increased visibility of women in computer science has been a positive,” Yin said. “If you can’t see it, you can’t be it.”
On the student level, WICS works to reach out to female admitted students interested in SEAS, provides mentoring and support for female concentrators, and holds conferences, such as the recently launched WEcode, a set of workshops and speeches from prominent female leaders in technology like Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl K. Sandberg ’91.
Macdonell praised the organization’s efforts. In reference to the distribution of nail polish favors to female students at WEcode, which attracted media attention and claims of sexism, she wrote that the favors helped to reaffirm that “you can be a woman, you can be feminine, and there is a place for you in the tech world where you can keep that identity.”  
Still, it is difficult to measure the success of efforts to attract female concentrators, particularly as SEAS has rapidly grown. Most evidence of these initiatives’ effects is anecdotal, Madoff said.  
Moreover, some students question the efficacy of efforts to recruit female concentrators. Hempel said that the school’s attempts to target admitted female students who have already expressed an interest in engineering does not address the deeper problem of increasing the number of women interested in the field in the first place. 
Vladimir Bok ’14, a computer science concentrator, said that he prefers student initiatives over administrative attempts to address the gender gap. 
“I do recognize it as a problem,” he said.”But I am always having a hard time [with] any centralized effort to engineer something to happen. I am a much bigger fan of the grassroots efforts, such as [WICS].”
In fact, Harvard’s 1:2 ratio of female to male concentrators is actually above the national average. According to a 2009 report from the National Science Foundation, women represented only 18 percent of students enrolled in engineering programs. 
“It’s really a testament to how hard the SEAS faculty, administration, and students have been working—really, before this was a hot topic—to be make the department welcoming to and accepting towards women,” Madoff said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
When University President Abbott Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877, introduced the House system at Harvard in the 1930s, he sought to unify upperclassmen, who had previously lived in disparate conditions across campus.
Yet, for much of its existence, the House system has been anything but equitable. Houses diverged significantly in their resources and attracted particular strains of the Harvard student body. Initially through a selection system based on student interviews with House masters and later through a student ranking process, the composition of each House differed by race, class, and interests.
Only in 1996 did the College implement a randomized sorting system to send freshmen out of the Yard and into the Houses, addressing the inequity of the residential system that had existed for more than 60 years.
Now, with construction on Leverett’s McKinlock Hall set to end in the summer and renovations on Dunster and Winthrop Houses scheduled to begin in the next three years, the House system again finds itself in the midst of change, as a massive renewal project seeks to update aging infrastructure and revamp community space.
However, questions remain as to whether current undergraduates are being left behind in the process. While students and administrators alike recognize the project’s long-term aim to smooth out structural variation in the House system, some express concern that in the short-run undergraduates will have to suffer through a system marked by greater inequality.
DIFFERENT HOUSES, DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES
While the Office of Student Life touts the House system as the “foundation for the undergraduate experience at Harvard College,” with differing facilities, locations, and room configurations, not all Houses are created equal. Some boast squash courts and rock-climbing walls, while others offer a multitude of single bedrooms or a conveniently fast walk to class.
“It’s not an equal process,” says Rob C. Gunzenhauser ’15, “but I like to think that somehow, somewhere, everything works itself out.”
Gunzenhauser, an Adams House Committee co-chair, cites not only physical assets like the Pool Theater as contributing to Adams’ unique identity, but also the culture of acceptance fostered through House traditions like Adams’s Drag Night.
Distinct amenities offered by each House play a role in shaping diverse student experiences. While students pay uniform room and board, set to cost $14,669 for the 2014-2015 school year, those in the unrenovated River Houses must frequently live in walk-through doubles, while all residents of Mather House and many in the Quad enjoy spacious singles.
Jacob S. Miller ’15, a Currier HoCo co-chair, says he believes that Currier residents find that “even without renovations, the rooming quality is very, very high,” as their House boasts some of the largest suites on campus, as well as a plurality of single bedrooms.
Others say that inherent differences in the core features of the Houses, such as room size and distance to the Yard, are hard to overlook.
“It shouldn’t be that something totally random carries so much weight,” says former Undergraduate Council President Tara Raghuveer ’14, referring to the centrality of House life at the College.
“But saying the two things at once, one, this is totally random, and, two, this is supposed to be your everything, you’re really setting yourself up for failure, setting people up for expectations you can’t possibly meet,” she continues.
Administrators agree that Houses are structurally different, but contend that the positive and negative aspects of each House balance each other out.
“Almost every House has something that makes it less attractive,” says Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67.
Co-Master of Eliot House Gail A. O’ Keefe says that staff, tutors, and masters work hard to “smooth out the rough edges” created by physical differences through establishing a vibrant and unique social community in each of the Houses.
For some students, though, the presence of such communities is not enough to assuage what they see as vast differences in experience brought about by the housing lottery.
Raghuveer, who used to live in Currier but moved off campus with her blockmates for her senior year, says that she thinks that balance is often unachievable given differences in student preferences.
“The singles in the Quad doesn’t make the distance okay, and the short distance in the River doesn’t make the rooming situation okay,” says Raghuveer. “Those things aren’t equal, necessarily.”
Claire R. Leibowicz ’16, who is hoping to transfer with her blockmate from Pforzheimer House for the upcoming school year, says that while she loves the House community, the distance made her experience at the College very different from that of her friends who live along the River.
“There’s no worse feeling than standing in the dead of the winter at Widener gate with a million things to do and you don’t even know when the next shuttle is going to come,” Leibowicz says. “It just kind of feels like you’re living your life on someone else’s schedule. And there’s nothing worse than when you’re at a friend’s room…and it’s like, ‘do I leave in two minutes or do I leave in 41 minutes?’”
STRIVING FOR EQUALITY
University administrators hold that the current renewal effort will bridge significant variation between the Houses.
The 2009 Report on Harvard House Renewal outlined the project’s goal of offering similar basic amenities across the system, while maintaining each House’s unique physical profile.
Among its recommendations for the project, the report calls for all Houses to feature “key activity spaces,” like a library and TV room, as well as “at least one unique specialty space,” such as a wood shop or printing press.
According to Assistant Dean of Faculty of Arts and Sciences Physical Resources Merle Bicknell, one of the primary goals of House renewal—a project set to cost more than $1 billion—is to preserve the historic character of each individual House. Yet the renewal project also offers an opportunity to promote more consistency in House facilities.
“Through renewal, each House will retain its unique character and traditions, yet each House will offer students access to similar amenities,” Bicknell writes in an email.
Renovations will also equalize the rooming situations for seniors, according to Associate Dean of Student Life William Cooper ’94. Cooper writes in an email that plans for House renewal include providing all seniors with “n+1” housing.
Some students say they think House renewal will equalize the residential experience by expanding accessibility and possibly establishing more uniform housing quality.
 
Quincy HoCo Co-Chair Chanel E. Washington ’15 says she appreciates the installation of more elevators under renewal plans, as the majority of the Houses are not fully accessible to people with physical disabilities.
Miller also cites renewal’s role in potentially designing living spaces on the River that are on par with the rooming quality in the Quad.
“[With House renewal,] River Houses are at least getting closer to the kind of housing folks in the Quad have been lucky enough to have for years now,” he says.
However, changes to brick and mortar cannot alter certain essential elements of the Houses. Construction, for example, will not shorten the walk down Garden St., a distance which many students cite as the main disadvantage to residence in the Quad.
“The biggest drawback to Currier is just distance, which renovations don’t really do that much about,” Miller says.
RENEWING INEQUITY
In addition to such inherent limitations of renewal, the project may exacerbate pre-existing discrepancies, as renovated Houses coexist with those still awaiting renewal.
“Students won’t be in these [renovated] spaces and experience the renewal that their friends are experiencing and [will] feel envious and unhappy about it,” says Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde, citing the considerable time it will take to renovate all the Houses. “That’s just the pain of this process, and there’s no way to avoid it.”
But with renewal projects set to remain along the River for some time to come, some students are concerned that perceptions of the Quad Houses will suffer.
“There will be students here probably for all four years that exist at a Harvard where the River Houses are just way better than the Quad Houses,” Raghuveer says. “And you need to think about how to make that a little bit more equitable.”
According to Currier House Co-Master Elizabeth A. Ross, structural updates to the Quad Houses that have yet to be renewed will ensure that the Quad is not seen as a “second best option.”
“You can’t just leave them until 2020,” Ross says of the Quad Houses. “You have to make sure that there are renovations and improvements that kind of go along parallel, so that when they do come to renovate it—in the interim—there will have been things that we can all do to make sure that they don’t slip too far behind.”
But the inequities that come with the slow renewal process extend beyond the physical qualities of each House and affect students financially.
In a previous interview, Cooper says that the goal to increase House common spaces took priority over the provision of storage space, which will eventually lead to the loss of on-campus storage facilities. Once the renovations on a House are completed, students will be asked to pay for off-campus summer storage through the Harvard-sponsored Collegeboxes or an outside service.
The average cost of storage at several hundred dollars will be shouldered by Quincy students beginning this summer and Leverett students next summer, while residents of other Houses farther down the renewal pipeline may not face this additional cost for another decade or more.
Washington acknowledges that Quincy’s previous free storage was a privilege that students were fortunate to have enjoyed, but she says she sees an equity issue with the loss of that privilege.
“The way that as each House becomes renewed they lose their storage creates this inequality because you don’t choose your House—it’s done at random,” she says.
Students also raise the question of whether renovated housing is indeed more desirable. Upperclassmen previously opted out of inhabiting the new rooms in Stone Hall, and while Washington praises the patio and high-tech social and study spaces created in the new dorm, she adds that students have generally found the renovated room clusters and public common rooms to be less attractive than the traditional suites in New Quincy.
With the timing and extent of any renovations beyond those on the Neo-Georgian River Houses remaining unknown, these inequities between Houses may exist indefinitely.
“The River Houses are about 80 years old, so it made sense to start there,” Bicknell writes. She adds that the completion of Dunster’s construction will prompt a reassessment of renewal to determine the best path forward, but stresses that the subsequent renewal of the remaining Houses is not guaranteed.
“Beyond [the renewal of Winthrop,] there have been no decisions or announcements made regarding further projects. But our hope is that all Houses will have an opportunity to be renewed,” she writes.

Last fall, the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid released a promotional video targeted at prospective applicants to the College called “Anything Could Happen at Harvard.” Scene by scene, the 16-minute video paints a cheerful and diverse image of an undergraduate experience rife with possibility. Once you are here, the video suggests, the broad spectrum of Harvard experiences is yours for the taking, no matter your background.
Yet, for those who come from low-income backgrounds, not all elements of the undergraduate experience are as fully accessible as they are for their wealthier classmates, in spite of the College’s recent efforts to open its gates to an increasingly diverse group of students.
Ten years into an initiative that has made Harvard’s the most robust financial aid program in the country and likely contributed to the matriculation of the College’s most diverse classes in its 377-year history, the gap between Harvard’s poor and its overwhelmingly affluent student body has become a pervasive part of undergraduate life.
Class background—while no longer as significant a factor in the ability to afford a Harvard education—still plays a large part in determining students’ experiences on a campus dominated by peers far wealthier than the average American. Socioeconomic status subtly shapes undergraduate life in a myriad of ways, as personal finances and class background influence students’ abilities to join student groups and otherwise partake in the experience idealized in brochures.
Many students from low-income households say that the financial barriers they bump up against everyday influence their sense of belonging at an institution that prides itself on inclusiveness.
Students rich and poor describe a reality that contradicts the message Harvard broadcasts to prospective applicants when it claims that anything, for anyone, can happen here.
“‘Anything can happen at Harvard’—that is such an empty statement to me,” says Keyanna Y. Wigglesworth ’16, who says that she receives significant financial aid from the College. “That’s such a Harvard thing to say—‘anything can happen here.’ No, it can’t, because people come from all different types of places in the world and walks of life.”
HARVARD’S INCOME GAP
Harvard is undoubtedly a national leader in offering financial aid to its undergraduates, a fact well-broadcasted both within its gates and beyond them. Launched in 2004, the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative today gives 20 percent of undergraduates—those with household incomes less than $65,000—the chance to attend the College almost for free, with no expected parental contribution.
Administrators tout the program as key to promoting class diversity at Harvard. And as the University celebrates the initiative’s 10-year anniversary, it also prepares to welcome its most racially diverse class of students ever to campus this fall.
“Harvard is much more diverse today than it was even a few years ago and we continue to bolster our efforts to make Harvard even more diverse in the years ahead,” Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 writes in an email.
Indeed, Harvard goes beyond any legal obligation in providing financial assistance to its students and promoting accessibility to its educational resources. Even so, despite the rise in socioeconomic diversity the College has seen since starting the Financial Aid Initiative a decade ago, its student body today is still far from representative of the country’s income distribution as a whole, as Harvard students are disproportionately upper class.
In The Crimson’s 2013 survey of the Class of 2017, 15 percent of respondents reported an annual family income of less than $40,000—a much smaller proportion than the U.S. as a whole. Meanwhile, 14 percent of respondents reported family incomes of more than $500,000; by contrast, less than 1 percent of American households fall within this range.
Even Harvard’s middle-income students earn at least two and a half times the amount that the median American household brings in during a given year, the survey shows. About 70 percent of respondents said their family income was over $80,000. The median household income in the U.S., by point of comparison, was just $51,371 in 2012, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Those statistics offer a glimpse of a freshman class disproportionately filled with students from upper-middle and upper-class households, and comparatively few on the other end of the spectrum, leaving disadvantaged students to navigate a campus dominated—statistically, at least—by peers who hail from backgrounds more affluent than their own.
THROUGH THE GATES
When prospective students, no matter their socioeconomic status, receive letters informing them of their acceptance to Harvard, for a moment they hold in their fingertips the ticket to all the resources and opportunities that a Harvard education has to offer. And when generous financial aid packages enable them to accept that offer, students from low-income backgrounds can look forward to four years at an institution that for most of its history has been reserved for society’s socioeconomically elite.
The College supplements students’ financial aid packages with a number of programs to help them buy and rent winter coats and computers, respectively, and advise them on available resources to aid them in their transition.
Even before students arrive on campus, administrators in the Freshman Dean’s Office will have prepared to facilitate a comfortable transition for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, creating socioeconomically diverse entryways and making sure not to pair a student who receives no financial aid and a student on “extreme aid” together in a two-person room, Ivy Yard resident dean Michael C. Ranen and Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 explain.
But even as administrators sort students into residential settings over the summer, students have already begun sorting themselves along class lines.
While wealthier students are free to spend their summer or even a gap year before matriculation traveling the globe or diving into internship experiences, for those facing serious financial constraints, delaying the arrival to Cambridge can be out of the question. Where the rich can choose from a range of pre-orientation programs in the arts, outdoors, or service, for those who need to earn money, there is often only one option. The chance to earn a few hundred dollars before the term begins can be difficult to pass up, even if the First-Year Outdoor Program offers financial aid.
Wigglesworth, now a Cabot House social studies concentrator, worked for Dorm Crew before her freshman fall to earn money before class started, and she says she met her closest friends there. Almost two years later, she points to pre-orientation programming as an early cause of separation along class lines within the student body.
“Since you already have it split up like that, where...kids who need the opportunity to make money do a certain program and kids who don’t do a different program, you can already see the separation happening,” Wigglesworth says.
Regardless of whether or not they participate in pre-orientation programming, students from low-income households arriving on campus for Opening Days may find that interactions with their wealthier peers can amount to a culture shock, creating, for some, an early sense of alienation.
“My freshman year, I was just really acutely aware that I didn’t belong with the overwhelming majority of people that were here,” says Cody R. Dean ’14, who arrived in 2010 from a low-income household in West Virginia.
Matthew Wozny ’14 says that coming from this sort of background can put students at unease among wealthier individuals whom he saw displaying a sort of “etiquette” he had not seen before. As a result, he felt that he spoke in a way that some classmates did not find appropriate.
Jesse G. Sanchez ’14, a first-generation college student from San Diego, was surprised by the way students dressed at Harvard. In preparation for his freshman year, he purchased a number of large, unmarked, colored T-shirts—called “club pro” or “shocker” tees—to convey a sense of seriousness about his schoolwork. He planned to iron them each morning before class.
When he came to campus, however, he found that his style set him apart from peers he saw wearing collared shirts and brands such as Ralph Lauren instead. Sanchez says he felt out of place at first—and an interaction with a classmate early on that year only served to exacerbate that feeling.
To his surprise, another student approached Sanchez and asked if he was a classmate's Phillips Brooks House Association mentee from Boston.
“I think that there are these small moments where you realize, wow, I really stick out then, if this person thought that there was no way I could have been a student here,” Sanchez says. “I think moments like that are very eye-opening.”
PRICED OUT
When students make it through their first weeks of college and progress into the rest of their undergraduate careers, early disparities between the experiences of disadvantaged students and wealthier peers are often reinforced, rather than relieved, as students become more involved on campus.
While classmates who come from affluent households can choose whether or not they want to work and may even receive allowances from home, students of lower socioeconomic status need to work, sometimes not only for their own financial subsistence, but also to supplement family members’ incomes back at home.
Dean says he looked for employment right away, finding jobs where he could work between 6 p.m. and 2 a.m., when he was not in class, in part to send money back home to his family.
Like many other students, Sanchez praises the work-study opportunities that Harvard offers its students and the opportunity to attend the College that financial aid has given him. But he adds that term-time work can be a factor in determining students’ abilities to participate in other aspects of undergraduate life like extracurricular activities. Participation in student groups—which many graduates will later call the highlight of their four years at Harvard—is more accessible to peers whose schedules are not bound by shifts shelving books in Widener Library, preparing coffee in Lamont Café, or waiting tables at a restaurant in the Square.
Financial requirements of participating in extracurricular activities can limit low-income students’ access to the experiences they offer even further. Groups like club sports teams often charge dues or ask students to pay for their own equipment, and those costs, while perhaps insignificant to wealthier classmates, can deter students on a budget from participating. Sanchez remembers going to the annual activities fair at the start of his freshman year and feeling limited to groups that did not charge membership fees, limiting his freedom to explore as many potential interests.
Programs like the Student Events Fund, a need-based initiative to reduce the cost of attending some campus events for students who qualify, can mitigate some accessibility inequities. Still, SEF covers only a portion of the various extracurricular expenses that can add up over four years at Harvard—some of which are measured in not tens, but hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
Current Undergraduate Council leaders worry that the problem is getting worse as the body faces budgetary constraints and available funding for student groups becomes increasingly limited.
“We don’t think about the costs of certain activities. We don’t think about about the embarrassment of having to talk to a peer if you can’t afford the cost of certain activities,” former UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14 says. “I think that reinforces a divide here.”
Some say final clubs, often seen as symbolic of wealth-based exclusivity, reinforce inequalities because the punch process favors students who know other members. Raghuveer—herself a member of the all-female Bee Club—acknowledges this, although she says she does not see final clubs as the extent of the class inequality problem at Harvard.
Some, if not all, of the clubs offer financial aid. The presidents of Harvard’s male final clubs either declined to comment or could not be reached. According to Raghuveer, the Bee offers financial aid.
Beyond membership fees, the perceived atmosphere of the clubs can deter low-income students from getting involved. Wigglesworth, who says she sees the clubs as a concentration of wealth, was invited to punch this year but did not participate because she felt that she would feel uncomfortable in such an affluent environment.
“I felt weird being around all that money, and all that privilege,” Wigglesworth says. “I felt that when...the privilege difference or gap is so wide and so big, it’s hard for you to get along socially with people and to connect.”
These inequalities in the extracurricular realm reinforce separations between low-income students and the rest of Harvard’s largely affluent student body, separations that are more subtly reinforced by differences in clothing, the ability to eat out, or the way students spend their summers and time off. Wozny says that unlike his experiences in high school, he has found that relationships at Harvard are built along class lines in that students from lower income backgrounds cannot afford to participate in the expensive activities that allow wealthier students to bond.
Even inside the House system, which on the surface serves as an equalizer to students who eat in the same dining halls and reside in the same on-campus rooms, inequities in the form of extra, inconsistent expenses can exacerbate existing disparities. This year, for example, only students in Quincy House were not offered free, on-campus summer storage for their belongings, and according to Fitzsimmons, there is no financial aid fund specifically devoted to covering the additional cost of storage for affected students.
CLASS DISCUSSION
Incoming Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana says that all students, no matter their backgrounds, should feel a “strong sense of belonging and connection” at Harvard, “period.”
But for some low-income students, that sense can be as inaccessible as participation in a club sport or initiation into a final club. Moments of exclusion from the experiences of wealthier peers can add up to create the feeling that they are not welcome at Harvard.
Dean says that he immediately felt that he was an outsider within Harvard’s gates, to the point that he would eventually send out a number of transfer applications to other colleges, compelled to escape the mounting insecurity he felt in his early days at Harvard.
The divergent perspectives from which he and his classmates approached political discussions, Dean says, contributed to the feelings of alienation that in part almost drove him away. He explains that the way his peers talked about alleviating poverty, for example, devalued his background. From these conversations freshman year, Dean says he inferred that classmates were saying, “You’re the type of person that we don’t want to exist.”
“If you can’t relate on…that basic of a level, it’s really hard to feel that you’re a part of an entryway at the level that everyone else does,” he says.
Substantive dialogue that many say could bridge such gaps is itself a rare occurrence at the College. Raghuveer says that the conversations she has had about class at Harvard have not been “productive.”
And when class does become central to discourse, it can provoke callous remarks that push the prospect for discussion further into the shadows. Wozny wrote about his experiences as a low-income student at Harvard and how they deterred him from giving to the senior gift fund in an op-ed published in The Crimson. In the comments section of that article, self-identified students and alumni posted vitriolic statements, dismissing his criticisms of Harvard as ungrateful and insignificant.
Although Wozny says that the negative reactions to his editorial have been “emotionally taxing,” he has since been contacted by other students who have felt similarly marginalized but have not spoken out on the issue because they fear the same kind of backlash he has faced.
While their peers largely avoid discussing an issue that unquestionably affects the quality of their Harvard experiences, a number of low-income students find themselves questioning their place at an institution that tells them “anything could happen” within its gates.
Dean, for his part, did not end up transferring to another school—he graduates from Harvard today—but even as he prepares to depart, he says he is unsure about whether or not an institution that so publicly claims to be a place inclusive to all was right for him.
“I don’t think Harvard is for everyone,” Dean says. “I don’t know if Harvard is or was for me.”
