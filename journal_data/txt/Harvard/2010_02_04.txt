As I watched Bubbles pick up his life again, I was overtaken with emotion.
I was sitting in front of my TV, at home, for the sixth consecutive hour, watching “The Wire.” Bubbles, one of the show’s most engaging characters, was a lifelong crack addict until his mid-40s, when a harrowing experience inspires him to slowly and painfully turn his life around and become clean. As he finds a steady job and reconnects with his kin, I could not help but express my happiness to my entire uninterested family, who could not understand why I was spending my entire break watching this crushingly depressing show. But seeing Bubbles’s growth partially renewed my faith in humanity, a faith that had been somewhat tarnished by hours of continuous exposure to Baltimore’s urban crime environment on “The Wire.”
“The Wire” differed in numerous ways from most of the (very) light television I watched, but most striking and powerful was the very human and real nature of the characters and story lines. Spending time at a college where everyone dreams and imagines having a terrific career and making a difference in the world, “The Wire” was a nice reminder that in the real world, happy endings are not a guarantee (or even likely): half-measures are common, and self-interest usually reigns supreme.  Neither conservative nor liberal in tone, the show is unabashedly critical of every major institution that affects our lives today, from government to corporations and newspapers. There’s a reason the show never won an Emmy, while “Entourage” has won multiple awards.
This is what made Bubbles’ story all the more powerful. In the dark and crummy world of “The Wire,” Bubbles, through sheer force of personality and spirit, survives. As I sat watching his televised redemption, I was glad I could see his story, and get a small, fictional view of the real world.

Real time: 1:17 p.m.  I’m eating lunch in the 20th-floor break room of the insurance company where I worked over January.  “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire” is on the TV in the background—or maybe the local news if more people are paying attention—and I’m savoring my peanut butter sandwich and the next 43 minutes away from my cubicle.
Watch time: 7:17 p.m. If I were still on my semester abroad, I would be walking beneath the almost 40 kilometers of porticos that line the streets of Bologna, Italy, on my way to an aperitivo—technically a before-dinner drink, but with a buffet of appetizers that served as our dinner.
Flying back from Italy and walking into an office building less than 72 hours later was definitely not my idea of la dolce vita, and maybe part of the reason why my watch was still set to Italian time.
Italian espressos had become weak office coffees, and I had traded in cheap flights on Ryanair and my passport for a commute on the Green Line and a CharlieCard. I wasn’t sure how a month of memorizing insurance policy numbers and coding data would compare to strolling through Roman ruins and learning to make tortellini from scratch.
Why, then, did I find myself at 5 p.m. on January 22 (11 p.m.: time to break out the euro-and-66-cent bottle of wine or get some late-night gelato) feeling almost nostalgic about clearing my leftovers out of the office fridge and packing up my personal belongings (i.e., my favorite pen)?
I’d become comfortable with the routine and the idiosyncrasies of the office.  But more than that, I was spending 40 hours a week seeing the way so many other 40-hour weeks were spent. I got a chance to play at real life between my study abroad Euro-trip and life back on Harvard time, and now I’m seven minutes behind instead of six hours ahead.

We wanted what every traveler wants: to shed the dorky veneer of American-ness and dissolve easily, like sugar in coffee, into the city. We had ducked out of the rain into Mesón del Café, a century-old coffeeshop hidden within the narrow, winding streets of Barcelona’s Barri Gòtic.
After an afternoon of shopping success—for Anna, an FC Barcelona shirt for her boyfriend; for Molly, a bottle of absinthe—we deserved a less touristy treat. And there on the menu it was.
“Chocolate soja.” It sounded muy español. It sounded sexy. It sounded good. What was soja? A word that our practical Spanish classes had never bothered to cover. But one of the lessons one quickly learns in Spain is that unfamiliar words often yield tasty results. So we ordered dos chocolates sojas, and then plopped down at a rickety table, primly pleased with our authenticity—“How terribly continental we are!”
Seven minutes of self-congratulation later, the chocolate soja arrived. We’d already experienced the joy of the café cortado, a shot of espresso cut with a small amount of milk, and that of Cola Cao, a Nesquik-like chocolate powder added to hot milk. But this? We wanted to bathe in this.
It was hot chocolate like we’d never tasted before.  Our consumption of our drinks was only interrupted by exclamations of delight.  Whatever it was, it was thick and rich, but somehow decidedly not-chocolatey. Our bellies and our sense of superiority satisfied, we soldiered on to the Sagrada Familia.
Later that night, we did what everyone does on a trip abroad: surf the Internet. We remembered the unknown word from earlier and quickly Google Translated that mother.  Turns out we weren’t as cultured as we thought. Soja means...soy.  We were nothing better than the needy, vegan Americans we scorned, too concerned with their own dietary restrictions to enjoy an authentic Spanish chocolate.

My first semester at Harvard was a whirlwind of red-brick buildings, late nights and early mornings at Lamont, and first impressions of my classmates, explored all while navigating through new extracurriculars and peculiar social scenes. My fall experience was confined to the so-called “Harvard Bubble,” so J-Term in Nicaragua and Honduras provided the much-needed break from my hectic and overly-complicated college life to recharge and reassess who I am and where I am going.
I started winter break in Nicaragua for two weeks of volunteer work with other college students through Friends of Students for 60,000, an organization that oversees continuing community development projects in small villages in the country. We helped launch the “Tengo Un Sueño” program, providing classroom and community support to a class of first graders. It was an amazing experience because of the enduring relationships we established with the local community, teachers, and community liaisons.
The trip was a “volunteer-cation” because, when we weren’t working, we explored the beauty of Nicaragua—surfing down the volcano Cerro Negro, swimming in a freshwater lagoon, playing games like “never have I ever” on cots under the stars, and dancing (or attempting to dance) to reggaeton. Through these shared experiences, I bonded quickly with the other volunteers; maybe because of our common interests, or perhaps our shared lack of cell phones, Facebook, and adequate deodorant, we formed relationships that will undoubtedly carry on even after our return to “reality” back in the States.
After an almost-missed, last-one-to-board-the-plane flight from Nicaragua to Miami to Honduras, my roommate and I were off to visit the orphanage I taught at last summer in the city of La Ceiba. Seeing the same 22 faces that I lived with this past June reminded me that, in spite of all that has happened since the summer, nothing had changed in my relationship with these kids. The important things—the songs we danced to (“Te Amo” by Makano), the English expressions I taught them (OMG or “¡Aye Dios mio!” en español), and the books we read together—were remembered and cherished by all.
Afterwards, my roommate and I went to Utila, an island off the coast of Honduras, to get our open-water dive certification. The island of Utila, known for its diving and nightlife, is frequented by dive junkies and backpackers from all over the world. At the dive hostel, we roomed with a cranberry farmer from Oregon, belted out Taylor Swift with a soldier who had just returned from Afghanistan, and strummed a guitar with a paratrooper in the Israeli army. It reminded me of my meals in Annenberg during the first few weeks of school, meeting my classmates and listening to the unique and amazing stories of what they have done and how they ended up at Harvard.
After four days of instruction and diving, my roommate and I were dubbed licensed open-water scuba divers. We explored the coral reefs of Utila, searching for the elusive local whale sharks. To our dismay, no whale sharks were found, and sea turtles and barracudas had to suffice.
Returning to Harvard after a month of living “la vida sencilla”—the simple life—in Latin America was weird, but in a good way. New friends, new experiences, and a new tan (now peeling) had entered my life, and it was refreshing to come back to school with an enriched perspective. This semester, I want to carry on “la vida sencilla,” really getting to know people, taking time to appreciate where I am and whom I am with, and focusing on the things that matter while letting everything else fall into place. Ah, home sweet Harvard.

They say you can’t teach style, but this spring, the Freshman Dean’s Office is going to try. A new non-credit class for freshman, “Introduction to Fashion” approaches the subject from historical, technological, and commercial perspectives over the course of five weeks.
The seminar is taught by Katiti Kironde ’79, the first black woman to grace the cover of a major fashion magazine. For several years, she has guided students interested in fashion through the Radcliffe Mentor Program and helped out with Eleganza a few years ago.
Even though the curriculum for the course isn’t yet finalized, over 50 freshmen have applied.
“They don’t even know what it is,” said Kironde. “I hope I don’t disappoint them.”
Katie W. Steele, Director for Freshman Programming in the FDO, hopes students get something out of the course that they can’t find other places at Harvard.
“I imagine that it will be both sort of informative and inspiring,” she said. “Those who are hoping to understand the history of fashion and how it’s changed over time, I hope they get a glimpse of that. But then I also hope that it will be inspiring, especially for those students who are considering getting involved in the fashion industry.”
According to Kironde, the class will provide students with the background to think critically about many aspects of the modern fashion industry.
“I want to make it more than just look at these pretty clothes,” says Kironde. “I hope that they get a broad view of what fashion means and what it is.”
The freshmen have already demonstrated a strong interest in fashion. The class was due to start on February 2, but was postponed for one week to accommodate the unexpected number of applicants. Originally designed for 12 to 15 students, enrollment will probably be capped at 20 to 25, according to Steele.

One of my favorite stories to tell goes like this: we were all sitting around our television on the night of Super Bowl XLIII, when one of my blockmates, in an attempt to show off his sports knowledge, said, “Oh man, Kurt Warner just got hit hard!”  He then continued, a bit perplexed, “Hey, but why did the ref just drop his yellow napkin?” To this faux pas I immediately responded with a deep, guttural laugh.  I was (this is the important part of the story) a sports god in comparison.
So perhaps this anecdote is just a crutch for my own insecurities. See, in truth, I don’t really know anything about professional sports. Currently, my favorite athlete is Wiggler, the giant female worm in “Mario Tennis” that, upon winning a match, will squeal and giggle (the cross-species equivalent of a chest bump) and then turn into a flower. And, to make it worse, all but one of my blockmates is just as completely uninformed as I am. On our last blocking group vacation, beach football was almost unanimously booed down in favor of sunbathing after about 15 minutes. We were a failed inception of the Great American Bro Blocking Group. The Brblocking Group, if you will. That is, we were, until “NFL Blitz” came along.
“NFL Blitz 2002” is a video game ostensibly about football for the GameCube.  Having such outdated graphics, each player looks as if he were finger-painted with a steroid-inflated fist, and the style of play is somewhere between a WWE match and a street brawl.  It is the ultimate icon of man, and ever since I bought it last term, we spend hours each week playing it, sitting together amidst the pastiche of filth and tactfully un-disposed beer cans that is our common room, more satisfied with our masculinity than a preening gym rat.  Which is to say, in other words, just sort of bro-ing out.
I have grown added chest hair since buying “NFL Blitz,” I think. But the effects of the game on my blocking group and me have been more profound. The whole thing started like this: One day, as I often did in the beginning of fall term, I was peering into the common room in Gollum-like fashion from my doorway (in New Quincy one single, mine, sits alone next to the common room, while the other four are downstairs). Though we use it heavily on weekends, our common room was always dark and empty during the week, as we are a quite busy and prolific suite. This particular time, however, I saw my roommate sitting alone in the common room, watching the football game that he knew no one else cared about, mournfully doing his Chinese homework in silence. We were both so lonely. It was a deeply moving moment, and it convinced me that we needed video games, stat. “NFL Blitz” wasn’t really just about making girls uncomfortable in our room; it was about bringing our blocking group together.
A cantankerous friend of mine once whined that it takes an “institution” to get people at Harvard to even consider hanging out together. By this she meant that we tend toward things that have a label, that are officially stamped as worthwhile or at least excusable by the powers that be, that fit nicely onto our resumes and succinctly into sentences explaining what exactly we have done with our time on earth. She complained, for example, that no one would waste his or her time having a lengthy intellectual debate unless it was for a debate team or a class; that no one would go on a day trip or organize a dinner with friends unless it was as a retreat for some organization; that no one would, say, spend four years together in a library unless it came with a diploma. I would extend this definition of institution into the more informal realm of culture, for example, to Alcohol: the institution of drinking on weekend nights is so standard for us that even if we nominally regret not having finished that paper instead of “going out,” we don’t usually consider it wasted time. However, if I spent several hours on a weeknight just sitting around with my blockmates, I would probably feel guilty about not doing something more constructive.
In summary, our blocking group needed an institution. This leads us back to “NFL Blitz.” In “NFL Blitz,” you tackle someone by punching them in the face. In “NFL Blitz,” if you are succeeding, you get lit on fire; and if you are lit on fire, and then you leave the couch because you have to go to section or answer an e-mail, “NFL Blitz” will punch you in the face. So yes, “NFL Blitz” has taught us that running plays are the ones with blue arrows and that the best way to sack the QB is with a body slam. But more importantly, it has become an institution for us. It has become a muscular bulwark against homework, e-mail lists and productivity, a serpentine trench in the excoriated battlefield of weeknight Lamonting, a brief but heroic drive through the line of all that would have us be friendless and overworked (and, clearly, also a sort of style guide for my sentences).
In other words, for me, it was never really about the football. And, in truth, it was never really about tying together the splitting shards of our blocking group either. We were doing fine; we were just a bit too busy during the week. And if it takes these sort of minor “institutions” to get people living busy lives to spend more time together, is this really that bad? Actually, it’s a bit exciting.  What’s next for us?  Weekly late-night pajama chats with Häagen Dasz? Cranium night? Hallway football (foam, for comfort)? —Alexander J. Ratner ’11 is a Physics concentrator in Quincy House. If he doesn’t pick up your  phone call, he is likely in the midst of scoring a touchdown.

The interior of my mom’s silver Toyota RAV4 was packed to its metal seams with an explosion of family possessions. A lifetime’s collection of life-size Care Bears held the backseat captive while everything from pillows to plates occupied the remaining space. This car and its contents were the earliest of our things to be transported in a cross-country move from Livermore, Calif. to Wellesley, Mass. It was the first to take the plunge.
After cramming in what we could, my sister Jackie and I watched from the window as an enormous tow truck pulled our RAV4 onto a platform and chained it there, holding both vehicle and heirlooms securely inside. Within minutes, the truck was lumbering away, carrying with it a rainbow-colored array of compact cars and the memories of three turbulent driving tests I had taken with the Toyota.
As it made its way off into the sunset, Jackie and I sadly pondered this permanent departure from our fair weather home to the faraway climes of New England. Although we had moved several times before, our attachment to California was particularly strong, since it was where we really began to grow up.
I spent many of my formative years in Livermore, dealing with a “High School Musical” obsession, witnessing an iguana invade the local pool, and getting to know some of my best friends. Losing the warm temperatures of California was definitely threatening, but even more so was losing the connections I had built there.
When I first left for college, I bade farewell to the West Coast knowing I could always go back. Over J-Term, I left with a much more permanent sense of departure, but also a curiosity for what’s next. After all, I’m going from a place that’s hella awesome to one I hope will be just as wicked cool.

Christmas brings Mariah Carey, 75-percent-off sales, and, for my family, a trip to my mom’s Southern suburban hometown of Concord, North Carolina. Down there, Christmas signifies more than the token tree in the living room and Duane Reade window decorations, and every year, my holiday begins with the Christmas Eve service at my grandparents’ church.
The service is casual and lovely and ends with a quaint ceremony in which the congregants, each holding a candle, light their neighbor’s wick as they all sing the familiar, soothing “Silent Night.”
But in the middle of this year’s service, the choir director’s daughter stepped on stage to sing “Emmanuel,” a drudging ballad of a hymn that I had never heard of before, and as soon as she released the first note, it was very clear that the song was going to be unfortunate. She was terrible. Not voice-cracking, not squeaky—there was nothing particularly notable about how bad her voice was, but it was bad in an off-pitch, out-of-key, YouTube-funny way.
The calm I previously felt devolved into a broadening grin, then a suppressed giggle, then burgeoning self-consciousness at my inappropriate response to her humiliation. Rather than feel bad for the poor girl, standing alongside her dad with the beautiful baritone, my sisters and I started laughing. At first our laughter was controlled, almost squelched. But once one of my sisters released an indelicate, indecorous snort, my control waned. I started laughing so hard that I quaked. I held my hair in front of my face and pinched my legs, but no matter how hard I bit down on my lower lip or tried to imagine that it was I being humiliated on stage, I could not stop shaking, sobbing silently with utter exuberance.
It was wildly inappropriate, terribly disrespectful, and downright mean, and I don’t know where it came from. I would like to think that I am not just a sucker for schadenfreude and that instead the hysterics were partially the result of feeling out of place in the devout setting. Or partially because of the irony that “Emanuel” is also the name of my temple back home. Or maybe it was just an expression of pure immaturity. I really don’t know. Regardless, it was a jolly service indeed.

I have never been able to play golf. The few times when my parents were able to get me on a course, I would last about three holes before my attention began to wander. Admittedly, I was never very good, which makes playing quite difficult.
When I realized that I would have almost three weeks in Florida over J-Term, I decided that it was time to give it another try (the weather also happened to be unseasonably cold, so there wasn’t really much else to do). My first game of nine holes was interesting, to say the least. While the sporadic golf lessons of my youth served me well, the game was not exactly a success. Randomly I would make a great shot, which would cause my mother to emit a siren-like sound—“Whoowhoo!”—to let me know that I was on fire. However, more often than not, my game was catastrophic.
At one point I made a lovely drive onto the fairway of the hole next to the one that I was playing. My mother noted with amusement that I had interrupted the game of the Ladies Club Champion, who gave me a polite smile when I went to retrieve my ball. My worst hole involved my ball landing in the trees off the side of the fairway.
Since I had spent the day with my ball going in any direction other than the one in which I intended it, my mother suggested that I simply aim for the tree and the ball would probably end up on the fairway. Of course, that was when my aim suddenly became accurate; I had to take four swings, and hit four trees, before I managed to make it out of the woods. Yet by the end of J-Term, after putting in a lot of hard work, I did successfully manage to play a few full rounds of 18 holes without embarrassing myself.

Hey,  Don A. Lattin, author of “The Harvard Psychedelic Club: How Timothy Leary, Ram Dass, Huston Smith, and Andrew Weil Killed the Fifties and Ushered in a New Age for America,” what was your reason for writing this book about     Harvard’s LSD-riddled past?
"Like millions of people in my generation, I experimented with psychedelic drugs. I had both positive, incredible, revelatory—can I say—mystical experiences. I also had soul-terrifying, damaging experiences, which I write about in the afterword. I think what is important is not the experiences people had on these drugs, which can be a trip to heaven or a trip to hell, but what you do with these experiences. Does it make you a better person, more aware, compassionate, less egocentric? These four men all did that in their own way. Their experiences influence us all."

Offered for the first time last semester, the course “French 60: French and the Community,”  is all about getting students out of the classroom. Students in the course learn about Haitian culture in addition to sharpening their French by volunteering as French tutors to Creole-speaking children aged 6 to 10 at the Haitian Community Center in Dorchester on Saturdays. Since last month’s disastrous earthquake, French 60 Senior Preceptor Carole Bergin has been working with the Harvard Haitian Alliance and encouraging her students to work as ESL tutors at the Center to help refugees in the area in addition to previous coursework.
While similar versions of the course have been offered in other languages, such a class has never been available to French students, according to Bergin. She was originally eager to create the class, she said, because Boston has the third largest Haitian population of any U.S. city.
Bergin hoped that the course would change the stereotypes students held about Haiti. By exposing them to Haiti’s literature, painting, music and food, she hoped that they would view the country in a different light, particularly after the earthquake: “Especially now, we don’t have to forget what’s happening in Haiti, but we don’t want to forget the beauty of it,” Bergin said.
Natalie E. McBride ’13, who took the course last semester and traces her roots back to Haiti, appreciated Bergin’s desire to debunk stereotypes, such as those about voodooism, which Bergin did by bringing in a voodoo priestess as a guest speaker. And while McBride’s Haitian heritage made the recent earthquake crisis in Haiti hit close to home, she said that taking this course and volunteering in Dorchester made her more “aware.”
Non-Haitian students in the course also developed a new viewpoint on the crisis. Gresa Matoshi ’13, who was also enrolled last semester, confirmed, “I felt like it was different seeing that stuff on TV because I felt like I was connected to it in some way.”

The SOCH was bouncin’ last Thursday night with a juice bar, platters loaded with b.good sliders, and a dance floor full of freshmen eager to learn some new moves for the Snowball, the freshman winter formal held the next day in the Boston Park Plaza Hotel. The fun was, of course, completely dry. After all, this was “How To Dance Sober,” an event hosted by DAPA, whose funds are used to support safe, alcohol-free social events across campus.
The event featured three of Harvard’s dance groups: Harvard Ballroom, Harvard Breakers, and Expressions. Representatives from each taught attendees how to get down and dirty (the sober, non-messy way).
“In DAPA, we’ve been floating around this idea for a couple of years,” explained event mastermind Lindsay M. Liles ’10. “We tried this as a trial run to see how students liked it.”
Melanie J. Comeau ’13 made her way over to the event with two of her friends, ready to break it down in a tank top and sweatpants. “We’re learning how to bust a move in style!” Comeau said, and added that she would definitely be using her new dance move repertoire at the formal. “The kids won’t even know what’s coming.”
Samuel Q. Singer ’13, a member of Harvard Ballroom, wasn’t teaching steps, but he decided to come and check out the moves that his teammates were sharing. “We’ve been taught a few steps of the one-step swing,” Singer said as he hung around the tables, catching a breath before going out again to learn from the Harvard Breakers.
The event was attended by roughly 40 freshmen. “It was a pretty good turn out, considering it’s snowing outside,” Liles said. For future semesters, she plans on expanding the program and presenting the idea to upperclassmen for their dances as well.

By our powers combined, this weekend brought some adulterous lip-locking for certain members of a crew of Harvard athletes. Most attendees of Gilbert’s Saturday throwdown––a truly epic gathering, to be sure––found it particularly difficult to step around the pools of drunken vomit. Likewise, a certain birthday boy found it near impossible to tolerate all the Pudding served at his celebration, and was forced instead to toss his cookies.
Some sad students thought their Saturday most successfully spent pining pathetically (and piss-drunk) after long-lost loves. Here’s a hint: it was “Once Upon A Time in Mexico.” Try elsewhere. FM wishes to remind you that shitshow weekends make it highly unlikely that your eye infection is “just because you left your contacts in.” Oh and BTWs, poppers apparently don’t do jack shit, says one Fox-y Friday night reveller...FUGETABOUTIT!

No three-word combination since “I love you” has packed so many meanings into so few syllables. It’s not that I love “doing” lunch with people. I just love the ambiguity of the phrase and how its apparent simplicity belies the complexity of its usage.
It’s that time of the year: the return from break. And a longer winter break than we’ve ever had, at that. People had a whole month to go to exotic places and work on their tan or go back to school and work on their thesis. In the flurry of the first days back you see them all, mostly in passing.
Close friends I actually thought about during vacation (comprising approximately five percent of encounters), I will sincerely catch up with. Seventy-five percent of encounters are the total randos I didn’t know before break and won’t know after graduation. And then there’s that 20 percent: acquaintances. The “let’s do lunch” contingent (alternatively called the “just the tip” cohort, but that’s for another day).
You’re walking down the sidewalk. You’re in line for hot food. You’re in a crowd leaving class. The conversation goes something like: “Hey!” “Hi!”  “How was break?” “Great, how was yours?” “It was great.” Pause. You’re farther down the sidewalk. You’re spooning some tater tots. You’ve left the class. So then what? If you say “K, bye!” it’s abrupt and awkward. If you try to actually have a conversation, it inevitably gets cut off. So you preempt an uncertain and potentially uncomfortable response with “Let’s do lunch,” and the person automatically agrees. You walk away commitment-free.
It’s a classic evasion tactic with a 100 percent success rate among that 20 percent of people. And I’d guess that eight percent of mine read FM every week, so I may have to find a new phrase.

In the early 90s, this phrase was almost entirely confined to the set of “Melrose Place” and to aerobics classes filled with expectant mothers wearing ASICS and sporting flimsy nylon gym bags.  It was eventually adopted by 50-year-old divorcée art gallery owners with raspy smoker’s voices who wear sunglasses inside and keep their dogs inside their stores.  You know the type of person I’m talking about?  Take your average HAA concentrator, minus the subtle pedantic braggadocio and flowing scarf, and add about 30-40 years. There. Now we’re on the same page.
In 1999, however, something interesting happened. Bill Clinton was finishing his last year as President. The Dow was up (and many predicted that it would keep rising). Other normal things were probably happening all around the world and at Harvard. It was in these times that the phrase made its way to Harvard by way of the most unsuspecting of mules: candidates for the UC, members of Theta, and HAA concentrators who needed to maintain friendship networks to populate the art shows they would eventually host in places like Santa Fe, Seattle, and any other up-and-coming metropolitan area featured in The New York Times travel magazine.
This subtle syntactic shift made it seem like “lunch” was an entity of its own rather than just a means by which humans interact and eat food. Accordingly, there are only certain places where it is appropriate that lunch should be “done”: seemingly modish but actually dull places like Grafton or Daedalus, both darlings of Harvard students on business lunches promoting their social entrepreneurship Web sites or catching up with their roommate back from a semester abroad in Buenos Aires or Shanghai.
Please. Lunch isn’t something that must be “done,” as though it’s an event all on its own rather than a means by which friends eat together. See you at Trata.

The only thing a Harvard student might find more tantalizing than a big fat “A” on a final paper is the prospect of a free slider after a long night of final club hopping.  The Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Service’s Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors (DAPAs), whose late night deals with b.good are just one of their methods of promoting safe and responsible drinking, seems to know Harvard’s penchant for penny pinching quite well.  Though some may think DAPA is no more than the white lettering on that free Nalgene they managed to snag as yet another irresistible giveaway, those who look beyond the loot discover a group of students armed with an important albeit somewhat surprising message.
Since its inception in January 2006, DAPA has spearheaded a mission slightly different than most typical drug and alcohol awareness education programs.  In line with Harvard’s amnesty policy, the student peer-advising group recognizes that students will drink at college and seeks to encourage safety above all else.
FROM THE DELPHIC TO THE DEBATE TEAM
Each fall, DAPA immediately exposes itself to freshmen during their mandatory workshop where the organization instructs students in everything from Harvard’s alcohol policies to the potential perils of final club partying while also demonstrating how few students can accurately pour an appropriately sized shot of alcohol into a Solo cup straight from the bottle. However, the DAPAs make sure to emphasize that they are open and approachable resources who can offer guidance without being judgmental.
“When selecting DAPAs, we look for people from a variety of different perspectives, different fraternities and sororities, social clubs, final clubs, sports teams, basically a diversity of perspective,” says Zachary D. Gober ’11, chair of the group’s Grants Committee. “DAPA is by no means an abstinence-only group.”
DAPA defies the notion that they are composed of only anti-alcohol students.
“People were thinking, oh yeah they are just the alcohol police on campus, which we aren’t at all,” says C. Chloe Orlando ’11, chair of the Events Committee.  “We have people who are drinkers, we have people who are non drinkers, we have people who drink casually but we all practice safe and responsible drinking if we do choose to drink.”
PIZZA WITH YOUR POPOV
DAPA’s duties are comprised of teaching students about the effects of binge drinking on the body, how to drink responsibly, and what to do if a friend has already reached a dangerous level of intoxication. More generally, DAPA sees itself as uniquely positioned to reach out to students in a way that adults and administrators cannot.
“Our purpose is to basically make sure that drugs and alcohol are treated in a mature manner,” says President of DAPA Cullen D. McAlpine ’11. “You don’t need to go out and knock back 10 shots to have a good night, so we hope students will for the most part pick up on that and lead a healthier lifestyle. We know that drinking is not going away so we want to make sure people are as safe as possible.”
DAPA is comprised of 30 student peer advisors who all graduated from an intense training program of 11 sessions. Besides being peer educators, DAPAs can also dish out the dollars for safe partying.  However, their range of funding is not just limited to your typical Wednesday night Monopoly marathon. In fact, DAPA will provide grants to alcoholic and non-alcoholic parties alike, though it will not finance the purrchase of any  alcohol.  Their purpose is two-fold. On the one hand DAPA wants to ensure that ragers don’t go awry because of a lack of food to offset the effects of heavy drinking. At the same time, they want to guarantee that students who don’t wish to rip shots all night have fun and creative alternatives to alcohol.
“With our grant from DAPA, we used the money to buy flavored blood orange sodas,” says Amelia G. Mango ’10 who has been awarded grants on behalf of the Center for European Studies’ annual Garden Party and Ball. “I think DAPA fills a sort of unique need.”
PERCEPTIONS AND PROGRESS
In its early stages, DAPA was perceived in a negative light because students were unaware of their full intent and purpose, merely seeing them as staunch enforcers who frowned upon all facets of collegiate fun.
“We have faced that problem,” says Bay B. McCulloch ’12, chair of the Promotion and Design Committee. “But we really want to promote DAPA as not being this crack down association that doesn’t want people to drink ever and wants to get them all in trouble.”
DAPA shows students that they’re here to help and not hunt by reaching out through various campus events. Their freshman workshops are the centerpiece—freshmen are statistically the most likely to binge drink, according to DAPA—but they also host other functions like last Thursday’s “Learn How to Dance Sober.”  And of course, there are the infamous “1 out of every 2 students don’t play drinking games” Nalgenes.
“It’s nice that the facts on the bottles and the other things we distribute generate discussion on campus about what people actually do,” says Gober. “It helps to combat the peer pressure, the idea that ‘everybody’s getting ridiculously wasted on weekends so I should too.’”
Despite the near-impossible job that DAPA has, its members are proud of how far it has come in just four years of existence.  Already, according to McAlpine, the number of freshman admitted to UHS for alcohol issues has dropped. And don’t worry, your freebie fixation will still be indulged as DAPA is looking to continue getting its name out there and making strides to end alcohol abuse.
“We are at a big turning point heading into a new era,” says Gober.  “An era where a lot of people know about us and respect what we do.”

Who wouldn't want to be the president of Harvard? After traversing through China in 2008 and much of Africa during Thanksgiving last year, University President Drew G. Faust’s next destination is Tokyo, Japan. This, of course, is all for business purposes only, namely in a continued effort to promote Harvard and encourage international scholastic cooperation.
According to an e-mail sent out to the Harvard Alumni Association and the Harvard Club of Japan, Faust plans to dine at the Harvard Club in Tokyo on Tuesday, Mar. 16, from 6 to 9 p.m.
But the price of eating with the president is steep. The meal costs about ¥15,000 or $165 for alumni and guests.  So maybe next time Faust comes to a dining hall near you, take advantage of the opportunity to chat her up—free of charge.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Student Life Fund is back once again after a semester-long leave of absence. The $50,000 fund, which comes from Dean of the College Evelyn Hammond’s discretionary fund, is slated for use by student organizations that wish to travel domestically and House Committees that plan to throw events. Spending on student life is a good cause, but this particular direction might not yield the highest returns for the general student population. While the Dean deserves praise for reinstating the program, we believe it should be reserved only for student groups, with no provision for HoCos.
Student-run organizations serve as the center of Harvard life for many, providing unmatched opportunities and generating countless friendships among their members. However, many of these groups struggle to finance their day-to-day activities. Student organizations deserve additional monetary support, and would therefore benefit from exclusive access to the Student Life Fund. On the other hand, ensuring that HoCos receive supplemental checks that go toward house formals and other activities should not be a priority for the College.
In the past, the Undergraduate Council determined how money from the Student Life Fund would be distributed. However, Dean Hammonds has announced a change: University Hall will now take on this responsibility. While we agree with Dean Hammonds that the UC is not the appropriate body for the task, we remain concerned about the lack of student input in the fund’s appropriation. To correct this, the administration should ensure that a student representative is included in the decision-making process. Specifically, a committee should determine the funds’ distribution—emphasizing transparency—with an undergraduate member always in attendance.
Despite these concerns, we are pleased that Dean Hammonds chose to devote a portion of her discretionary budget to the Student Life Fund this semester, and hope she continues to reaffirm this choice in the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Today, America’s hottest protest movement begins its first national summit. Sarah Palin will headline the National Tea Party Convention at the illustrious Opryland hotel in Nashville, Tenn. Hundreds will demonstrate against elitism and reckless spending by enjoying steak-and-lobster dinners in their $500 seats.
Despite the discordant extravagancies of today’s events in Music City, there are significant and complex elements to the grassroots dimension of the movement, and Democrats need to take them more seriously. During our winter of malcontent, MSNBC’s Keith Olbermann stooped to the level of Limbaugh, referring to Senator Scott Brown, who rode in on a tea party wave, as a “homophobic, racist, teabagging supporter of violence against women.” We need not give the movement undue credit—it’s wrought with internal contradictions and an irresponsible tinge of me-first-ism—but we do need to cease the condescension. Even if the movement doesn’t crystallize into a coherent political organization, its animating sentiments are not likely to disappear soon. Rather than patronizing the tea partiers, Democrats should take advantage of their political weaknesses and offer a clear and convincing narrative of why more expansive government is necessary to tackle our common problems.
Part of the reason Democrats patronize the tea party movement is because the mainstream media has done just that. Even wiser pundits who don’t dismiss the movement’s ideas unduly homogenize it. Moderate New York Times columnist David Brooks has characterized the movement as a mere populist surge against “the educated elite.” In truth, about half of the membership has undergraduate or advanced degrees. Most of its members couldn’t be categorized as populist by most rubrics—they want to live their lives as they privately see fit. Their participation in a civic movement is an ironic last resort. Although members are predominantly white and above  age 50, the movement is comprised of an eclectic mix of Ron Paul libertarians, George W. Bush social conservatives, hangovers from the 1992 Perot campaign, and states’ right-ers agitated by the mere idea of a National Tea Party Convention. Some want to form a third party, and others want to infiltrate the Grand Old Party. They are united by a dislike of President Obama, the debt, future tax increases, and the bank bailout, but currently little else.
But having tensions doesn’t mean they’re ignorant or simply opportunistic. Democrats should avoid making such caricatures. The best strategy is to let them tangle with the GOP machine and in the meantime reaffirm a progressive vision for America, coupled with tangible results. The President’s comment two weeks ago that the administration forgot to speak directly to the American people and their core values is dead-on. A post-election survey by Democratic pollster Peter Hart found that Senator Brown was elected primarily because Massachusetts working-class independents didn’t think the Obama administration was doing enough to address their economic concerns. Folks are upset at a lack of both efficacy and backbone. Democrats have to discard the image of a wonkish organization inextricably attached to Wall Street and an inept bureaucracy. Although this may not change the mind of fervent tea partiers in the short run, it’ll help weaken the movement’s influence on swing voters in the long run.
We need not cater to individualistic temper tantrums, but we also should not dismiss out of hand the views of a large part of the citizenry. Whatever happens in Nashville today, it shouldn’t be taken as a representation of the tea party movement. Democrats must better respond to the concerns of disconcerted Americans. A movement of “leave-me-aloners” can only form so much solidarity and might diffuse rapidly, but only if a compelling response is offered. Democrats need to reaffirm a narrative and clearly outline how our common sacrifices will help American families and communities. The message need not demonize anyone, but only reaffirm the principle that, as Tennessee’s great Aretha Franklin says, “without each other, there ain’t nothing people can do.

The biggest de facto American holiday is quickly approaching. Super Bowl Sunday XLIV will surely rival previous years in terms of massive television viewership and food consumption. In every aspect, the Super Bowl strives to achieve perfection: the best halftime show, the best commercials, and the two best football teams. The success of the Super Bowl is a testament to how popular professional football has become within society. It is impossible to avoid the ceremony surrounding this favorite American pastime, and professional football has more fans than any other sport. But in spite of these successes, there is one distinct feature of professional football that has room for improvement and has yet to be addressed.
Currently, the National Football League is the only major professional sport organization that doesn’t pay its officials a salary. Officials are part-time employees with regular nine-to-five jobs during the week. However, with professional football being as popular as it is, it is time for the officials to become full-time employees of the NFL.
The reason why the NFL should change their policy on officials is the height of the stakes of each game. Consider this: the average NFL team is worth $957 million, the Dallas Cowboys being the highest at $1.5 billion. That is an enormous investment by the teams’ owners and other investors.  In addition, the three major networks each pay an average of two billion dollars a year to broadcast NFL games. With millions of dollars on the line for each game, teams, television networks, and NFL executives give their best effort to produce the best football possible. The officiating should be no exception. If referees were full-time, they could watch film, attend practices, and devote their energies exclusively to football, which would minimize bad calls and misrulings.
The upward trend in overturned calls with the instant replay feature demonstrates the necessity of such full-time officiating. In 1999, there were 133 challenges, and 42.8 percent of challenged calls were overturned, compared to 229 challenges in 2008, of which 51 percent were reversed. The increase in challenges shows a decrease in confidence in officiating, and the increase of the rate of reversal might also suggest an actual decrease in the quality of officiating due to the use of the instant reply as a crutch rather than a tool.
Additionally, the nature of the sport requires an official to keep up with the pace of the game. The NFL is a showcase of some of the best athletes in the United States, and a referee must remain in top physical condition to keep up with them. It is impossible to measure how many missed calls were the result of officials who were unable to keep up with the players. However, officials would certainly be better able to stay on top of their exercise if officiating were their full-time job rather than having to sit behind a desk for a week before being asked to officiate a professional football game.
Of course, one might ask what specific activities a full-time referee could engage in that a part-time referee could not. For one, in addition to watching film and attending meetings with other referees, full-time referees would have the time to attend practices of teams other than those that they would be officiating over the course of a week. This would allow officials to watch and participate in game-speed situations more than once a week. Professional football coach and long time advocate of the full-time referee, Bud Grant writes, in Always on Sunday, “They can use all the bright new technology, but none of that is going to make them a better official who calls more plays right unless he comes to practice and watches what’s happening at full speed.”
Though referees make most calls correctly, there are still many calls that have influenced post-season games that officials later admit were wrong. During the playoffs in 2006, did Troy Polamalu intercept Peyton Manning? Even with instant replays, the referees still got it wrong, as official Peter Morelli later admitted, though the ruling ultimately decided the outcome of that game. Also, many Seahawks fans can attest to there being inconsistent officiating even in the biggest of games, as Superbowl XL demonstrates. Granted, a full-time referee will also make bad calls from time to time, but it is in the best interest of the game to make those occurrences as infrequent as possible.

To the editors:
The patently misinformed op-ed published on January 25 (“Summers’ Theory of Inequality” by Farley and Stone) is based on the false premise that Larry Summers made a confident assertion about gender differences; in fact, he laid out three different hypotheses in his 2005 talk. Farley and Stone refer repeatedly to a theory that simply does not exist. Speculating about three possibilities is quite different from stating (testable) results that follow logically from a collection of axioms—that’s what a theory is.
Their op-ed brims with innuendo and pretends to be revealing the former Harvard president’s views about women and features a “quote” that Summers—they think—would have used to respond to criticism. This would be perfectly fine on a page of a fiction magazine, since the total number of quotes by Summers not dreamed up by Farley and Stone in this op-ed is zero. Among the things Summers did say in his talk was that discrimination against women surely takes place in the U.S., but this reality is conveniently ignored by these creators of a curious new literary genre dressed up as commentary.
Admittedly, the op-ed succeeded at one thing: application of stereotypes. The penultimate paragraph invites readers to, “[w]atch how quickly [women] can figure out that marked-down price of any clothing item during a sale.” Comments on this jewel are hardly necessary.

Thrishantha Nanayakkara’s comments reflect the views of many intellectual elite in Sri Lanka.
In my opinion, it is too late in the game for the world to come up with any diplomatic pressure directly on leaders seeing as those rulers have been allowed to enjoy the dismal silence of the international community too long and to master the art of maneuvering the political tools of democracy and full sovereignty.
The voting pattern in the recently concluded presidential election also indicates a deep divide between two cultures in Sri Lanka. Tamil and Muslim minorities living in the North, East and the hills have said that they are a different people and put forth a resounding no-confidence vote. The elite of Sinhalese in the capitol Colombo have also voted for a political solution and lasting peace.
The election results send a more alarming signal to the Tamils, and to the civilized world at large, that a rural voter in a ‘Democracy by Ethnicity’ like Sri Lanka cannot not go beyond the policy of communal intoxication and anti-western sentiment. Another example of this reality was the conduct of state media during the polls—they continued to depict the ruler as a pious and pure soul offering prayers in the temples, thus not allowing the average voter to think past the Sinhala-Buddhist chauvinism. These are the exact types of policies that nurtured hate and communal disharmony in every Sri Lankan election leading to several ethnic riots unleashed on Tamils.
As hapless as they are breathless, the intellectual elite in the Sinhalese community are deeply frustrated now with the direction of the country. Sri Lanka did not need a presidential election for reconciliation with Tamils. The post-electoral violence, intimidation, and disenfranchisement of Tamils are seen as a precursor for what the Tamils can expect from the present rulers in the days to come.  The anti-democratic excesses of the current regime are likely to increase during the parliamentary election season.
This is the kind of democracy and sovereignty that the Sri Lankan authorities have been using as effective political tools to carry out mass carnage on the Tamil population and to hide the evidences of unimaginable atrocities.
Today, the Tamils in Sri Lanka are a nanion of widows, orphans, and maimed, with many families horribly devastated from the loss of their loved ones.
Sri Lanka is a clear example of a democracy by ethnicity that isn’t working in a culture where the vulnerable members are not protected.
The political pundits and experts on international law must find a way out of the existing system in Sri Lanka if the country’s minorities are to live with security and human dignity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The gun goes off, and after seven seconds I figure that I’ve seen everything I need to see.
The 60-meter dash is the shortest possible race, but one competitor easily separated himself from the field, and it is with little surprise that I note his name atop the overall scoreboard through five events.
Bryan Clay—the best athlete in the world that you’ve never heard of—seems well on his way to another win in the heptathlon, a baby step in his return to international prominence.
Despite gracing the front of a Wheaties box, Clay remains relatively unknown outside the track world. Indeed, the fact that little more than 25 people have come out to watch the man who earned silver and gold medals for the decathlon in the last two Olympics cannot be attributed solely to an uninformed Harvard community. After all, the meet is open to the public.
But I’m not lamenting the fact that Clay’s name doesn’t draw a crowd. If anything, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the “World’s Greatest Athlete” would have time to chat the day before the meet. And as I quickly learned, Clay is much more than even that title suggests.
At Harvard, we are accustomed to visits from the world’s most accomplished individuals. Although Olympians don’t stop by as often as Nobel Laureates, Clay’s pedigree seems fitting—in addition to his medals in Athens and Beijing, the multi-event star is the reigning world indoor champion, and, despite his compact frame, boasts the best discus throw ever in a world decathlon (55.87 meters).
None of these feats are lost on Clay, who shed the humility act that so many use to stonewall reporters.
“I feel like I can call myself one of the best decathletes that the U.S. has ever seen, and I think I can be pretty proud of that fact,” says the owner of the second-best heptathlon and decathlon scores in the nation’s history. “And I’ve got a chance to go and possibly win a third medal at a third Olympic games…and that’s something that no decathlete has ever done before.”
Of course, there is a reason that a third medal has proven so elusive for Clay’s predecessors.
Like NFL running backs, decathletes decline quickly under the strain of such rigorous competition. But Clay, who turned 30 last month, has a chance to defy this tradition. After all, the decathlete scored a 130.40 on the Nike SPARQ test—a sport-specific evaluation designed to determine overall athleticism. Clay’s score in the football version was the highest ever, leaving the NFL’s most electrifying stars, such as Super Bowl-bound Reggie Bush (93.38), in the dust.
So whether or not Clay has the longevity to stand out in London, the decathlete has already proven himself among the globe’s best.
My colleague Dixon asks Clay about his take on the title, and I eagerly anticipate his answer. Surely someone with so much confidence would show some pride in the distinction. But to my surprise, Clay is unimpressed:
“It’s just a fun title to have, that’s how I look at it,” he says. “But does it really change anything? No. I always tell people, I still have to go home, I still have to change diapers, I still have to take out the trash…and I can’t act like an ass to all my friends.”
“So yeah, it’s cool, and it’s an accomplishment,” Clay continues, “but it’s just something that I’ve done, it’s not who I am.”
At this point I’m confused. Clay has spoken at length about “rewriting history books” with a third Olympic medal, and yet would balk at the idea that these efforts define him. But as Clay continues talking, I begin to understand where athletics stand among his priorities.
Rather than let track take over his life, Clay lets his life take over the track.
The decathlete nods in the direction of two young children playing in Gordon Track’s long jump sand pit. I cringe, expecting the derision of an Olympian accustomed to pristine facilities, but instead he explains,
“This is my two kids [on a typical day back home]. My kids are at the track all day…If they want to come see Dad, I live two miles from the track, so [my family] can just hop in the car and come on down. I’m way blessed in that. Maybe some people think it’s a distraction, but it helps me be more focused knowing that my family is happy and taken care of.”
Suddenly, “who” Bryan Clay is becomes clearer. Despite the personal glory that accompanies a highly individual sport and superfluous titles, it is the ability to balance everything important to him that keeps the decathlete working.
“I’m competitive enough that my big goal is…to win a third gold medal at a third Olympic games, but if I don’t,” he shrugs, “then okay, I don’t. The next couple years are just for the love of the sport.”
Of course, Clay realizes that even world-class track and field athletes don’t make enough to lounge around, and it is not difficult to guess what will happen, whether or not he earns his third trip to the Olympic podium.
“When this all ends, I’m still going to have to go out and get a job and figure out what I’m going to do with my life,” Clay laughs.
Back at last Saturday’s meet, I make a crucial mistake following the gold medalist’s dominant performance in the sprint. I leave early to cover the Crimson wrestling team in a double-header, departing just as the warm-ups for the pole vault get underway. It is not until the next morning that I find myself staring incredulously at my computer screen.
Clay finished fourth. Not even on the medal stand. The competition’s standout athlete failed to clear a height in that fateful pole vault, forcing him to concede 804 points to eventual winner Maurice Smith—a blow magnified by Clay’s 785-point loss.
Undoubtedly, Clay was frustrated by his effort, but the Olympian didn’t take time to pout. Instead Clay rushed from Gordon Track immediately, trying to get to California as quickly as possible. He had more important things than the pole vault to think about, such as returning to his wife, Sarah, who delivered the couple’s third child yesterday.
As the two-time Olympian welcomes the fifth member of his family, it seems unlikely that he will brood over the Harvard Multi Meet for very long.
Clay’s experience in Cambridge was not so uncommon. Many of us stride onto this campus as freshmen no less confident than the decathlete seemed last weekend, and unsurprisingly, Clay is not the first of us to face a reality check. But while we may not have Olympic medals to comfort us when we fail, Clay’s perspective transcends his accomplishments. The decathlete insists on consistently focusing on what makes him happy, advice he readily shares:
“The thing I would tell kids and college athletes…is they just need to have a good understanding of who they are, what they believe…and they are going to be successful in whatever they do.”
By track standards, Clay wasn’t successful last weekend, but the decathlete’s outlook allows him to be flexible in his definition of the word. When we inevitably come up short at some point in our four years, may we too be so content in defeat.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A year ago, my fellow men’s basketball beat writers and I traveled to Ithaca, N.Y., to report on a disappointing loss for the Crimson.
My reward later that night?
A chance to rest my weary head on the thin carpeting of a Cornell University dormitory.
This past weekend we repeated the arduous journey upstate, and though hopes were high, my lodgings remained humble.
Following another woeful game, my spine grew intimate with the uncompromising floor of a studio apartment. That was the least of my worries, as the bitter cold forced me to don a hat and coat while attempting to fall asleep.
Believe it or not, the men’s basketball squad experienced an eerily similar case of déjà vu during its return to the land of gorges and waterfalls.
For the third year in a row, the Big Red blew out Harvard at home. And again, the Crimson was overmatched on the interior and allowed the opposition to score at will.
But somehow, this year’s edition of the annual massacre was even worse than before. Last year’s margin of defeat was a mere 21. This time around? Cornell devoured its Ancient Eight rival, 86-50 (for all the Big Red readers out there, that comes out to a margin of 36).
Let’s make this clear: the home squad was by far the better team Saturday night.
As its coach Steve Donahue says, the now nationally-ranked Big Red has the talent, depth, and experience to challenge any school in the nation.
Seven-footer Jeff Foote anchors the frontcourt and draws attention away from a steady rotation of accurate shooters.
Unselfish ball movement flummoxed Harvard’s defense, which often was slow to rotate and left Cornell with wide-open opportunities.
Still, a team fresh off mentions in Sports Illustrated and the Wall Street Journal should not be losing by 36 points.
The game’s outcome might be best explained as a perfect example of the Crimson’s glaring weaknesses—for one, its penchant for turning the ball over.
Harvard ranks 326th out of 347 Division I schools in taking care of the basketball, and many of this weekend’s gaffes were especially egregious.
An electric atmosphere, as well as the Big Red’s quick hands and commitment to defense, played a role in keeping the Crimson off balance, but many of Harvard’s 25 turnovers were unforced. Short passes suddenly became uncatchable, and dribbles went awry.
Unsurprisingly, three of the four leaders in turnover rate on the season for the Crimson are freshmen: forward Kyle Casey, and guards Christian Webster and Brandyn Curry.
Although Casey has improved steadily throughout the year, the wing ran into problems against the size and strength of the Big Red.
Sometimes content to shoot jump shots, Casey had four points and five turnovers, and has experienced issues with foul trouble all year as well.
Due to an injury to sophomore guard Max Kenyi, Webster’s minutes have risen as the season went on—having started all but four games this year—but his field goal percentage has headed in the opposite direction.
The rookie plays the highest amount of minutes of anyone not named Jeremy Lin, yet he possesses the team’s lowest offensive rating on the team and looked shaky against Cornell.
Classmate Dee Giger got off to a hot start, nailing four-of-six threes in the season opener at Holy Cross, but has shot 27 percent from behind the arc since then.
Highly-touted coming into the season, the freshmen may have hit the metaphorical “wall,” and their decline on the offensive end has only added fuel to the perception that Harvard is a one-man show.
While the team is ranked fifth in the country in two-point field goal percentage and eighth at the free throw line, it suffers from the lack of a second legitimate scorer when Lin is double-teamed, or on the rare occasions when the star guard receives a breather on the sideline or is in foul trouble.
Alone in his ability to consistently drive and get into the paint, only Lin was able to reach double-digits in scoring at Cornell.
Contrast this to the fact that all five of the Big Red’s starters reached the milestone.
It does not help that the Crimson’s lone seven-footer, sophomore Andrew Van Nest, makes his living out on the perimeter, hoisting up threes at an accuracy of 28 percent.
During Saturday’s match-up, the Big Red was content to pass the ball around until Foote was guarded one-on-one by Van Nest.
Only then would the all-Ivy big man go to work—which actually involved very little work on his part. Foote simply backed his man down and proceeded to add another two points to the scoreboard.
As one fellow writer remarked, “Watching Foote on Van Nest was like watching a puppy get executed slowly.”
The injury to senior forward Pat Magnarelli has only made matters worse.
The team’s best defender, Lin cannot be asked to take on big men (though, on occasion he found himself guarding Foote one-on-one Saturday night, to disastrous results).
Out on the perimeter, no defender was quick enough to keep up with the Big Red’s Louis Dale.
Not sophomore Oliver McNally, who is shooting at a lower percentage than he did as a freshman, and not Curry, who may be hampered by a reported knee injury that will require surgery at season’s end.
Add in a long bus ride the night before to the burden carried by Harvard last Saturday, and the blowout starts to make a little bit more sense.
This is not to rain on the revival of Harvard basketball, but simply to remind to keep expectations reasonable.
Head coach Tommy Amaker has done a commendable job in his short tenure at the helm, as his team now has the chance to break the school record for most victories in a season.
Though it looks to be Cornell’s year—and even if the Big Red comes to Lavietes Pavilion Feb. 19 and takes down the Crimson again—it’s truly a season to be savored for fans of Harvard basketball.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The adage "write what you know" is one of the most well-worn pieces of advice in the old literary playbook. For Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell, the creators of the musical "[title of show]”—which runs through February 13 at the Boston Center for the Arts— this saying became the playbook. And as an aspiring writer, perhaps I can follow in their footsteps.
I considered writing this review. Then I wrote some words of this review, deleted some words, played some video games, tried more words, ate some food, tried more words again, ate more food, more words, more video games, more food. And then I deleted it all.
Here I am, writing about writing a review of a “musical about two guys writing a musical about two guys writing a musical.” Simple. Yet, catchy enough to make it all the way to Broadway.
The show follows a rather unexciting and predictable plot line: the development of the production itself. Originally created as a submission to and eventual performance at the New York Musical Theatre Festival, "[title of show]" (which is so named after the "title of show" position on the Festival's application) marches from the musical's conception in 2004 to its run off-Broadway at the Vineyard Theatre, after which it transferred to Broadway. These developments in the show's history were incorporated into the script as they came.
However, it is not the plot that one would expect to drive this performance. Any suspense about the internal play's success is muted by the performance's very existence. Once the premise is established—here are four friends sitting on four chairs in a New York City apartment trying to achieve their dream—the expectations are set for a show that has cloyingly put a keyboardist, Larry (Will McGarrahan), in the corner of the apartment space to acknowledge as its self-awareness sees fit.
What ultimately engages, then, is the snap of the dialogue and the wit of the lyrics. In the original productions, Bell (who wrote the book) and Bowen (who penned the music and lyrics) co-starred alongside their three original collaborators: Susan Blackwell, Heidi Blickenstaff, and musical director Larry Pressgrove. In this production presented by the SpeakEasy Stage Company, the actors benefit from such an organic breeding ground; the chemistry between them is easily channeled into the jokes that play on the comfortable freedom of imagination that comes from being among friends.
Such evidence of homegrown humor often takes the form of the portmanteau: "hangry" as a word for hunger-induced anger, "procrasturbating" as one for procrastinating by masturbating. The interactions of the characters—Jeff (Jordan Ahnquist), Hunter (Joe Lanza), Heidi (Amy Barker), and Susan (Val Sullivan)—necessitate both the familiarity of raunchiness for hilarity's sake and the innocence of expression. From this dynamic, the most memorable moments are born: an entire number dedicated to the idea of a monkey riding a speedboat constructed around the theme of "Broadway musicals"; the hilarity of "What Kind of Girl Is She?" as Heidi and Susan both imagine that the other "might try to steal my husband! She might try to have my baby!"; and the earnest resistance in the face of critics and the breezily creative as embodied in the line "a little part of me just wants to punch those motherfuckers in the teeth," from the song "Die, Vampire, Die."
But at about the time the show reaches off-Broadway, the shtick starts to get a bit stale. Hunter's attempt to exclude the too-committed Heidi from the Broadway run puts an exceptionally cliché bump in the fabulous foursome's trail, while the inclusion of any of the musical’s developments or numbers starting with the song "Change It, Don't Change It/Awkward Photo Shoot" only serves to supplement the uncomfortable, forced mood in the most unfortunate of ways. "A Way Back to Then" is the exact sort of mushy, heartfelt song that Jeff stops Hunter from singing in the beginning; "Nine People's Favorite Thing" is a cute and mediocre attempt at a number based on a number.
“[title of show]” offers self-referentialism, off-color jokes, and hilariously naïve attempts at inner-city slang. But like a wittier "Will and Grace," its execution—endearingly realized in this iteration—is weighed down by sticking too closely to the book.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Awake at 9:15 a.m. Into the shower, breakfast and coffee, off to class at 11 a.m. Return to Eliot House. Hang with friends, go to lunch, check e-mail.
It’s now 2:30 p.m., and up to this point, it’s an average day for any Harvard student.
But for senior Jack Brady, that’s when everything changes.
Brady walks across the river, where, as captain of the Crimson track and field team, he arrives at practice early to speak with his coach about the day’s events.
Once his teammates arrive, it’s time for a quick warmup of stretching, running, and different agility exercises. And then  after that, Brady’s ready to go.
“He’s probably the most committed person I’ve ever known,” says Brady’s girlfriend, Molly Boyle ’08, a former Harvard track captain herself.
“He spends most of his free time looking up videos of new techniques, videos of the best athletes. He can tell you who the best athletes in high school, college, and the pros are...[and] he’s always on blogs and message boards looking up what’s new in the sport.”
Today, on a cold February afternoon, he practices the weight throw—and all the footwork and technique vital to its success—for an hour and a half. That means spinning around four times to gather strength and then throwing a 35-pound ball attached by a chain to a metal handle that Brady holds.
Then it’s off to the weight room for an hour and 15 minutes, followed by the occasional ice bath (which he calls the “horrible part of being an athlete.”)
It’s now 6:30 p.m.
Not such a normal day anymore.
It’s a routine Brady’s been accustomed to since the seventh grade, when he first got into track and field.
But during those years, he wasn’t focused on his throwing. The events he was most interested in were the triple jump and the long jump.
“I love to brag about how great of a middle school jumper I was,” Brady says.
Towards the end of seventh grade he picked up a shotput—a 16-pound ball that is thrown from the neck—for the first time.
By the time he entered high school, Brady was six-foot-five, and his size put an abrupt end to his jumping career.
He began to focus more on throwing the shot and the discus. His junior year in high school, he finished in the top 10 in Illinois state track meets in the shotput and the disc throw, earning all-state recognition.
Brady began to think about possibly being recruited to play the sport in college, and for the academically-minded athlete, the Ivy League made sense.
He sent former Crimson throws coach Paul Turner a letter expressing his interest in the program, and when he applied to Harvard early action, he was accepted. The small-town, Midwestern boy was overjoyed.
“Nobody from where I live goes to Harvard,” he says.
But then there was football, which he also excelled at as a defensive lineman—so much so that he had full scholarship offers from Division I schools such as Northern Illinois, Miami of Ohio, and Central Michigan sitting on the table.
Though it was tough to turn down the chance to play Division I football on a free ride, he immediately called the programs and told them he was going Ivy.
“I understood there was a large difference between Northern Illinois and Harvard,” he says. “Now that I’m here, I could never understand turning this down.”
When he arrived as a freshman, he tried to do what few at Harvard have done—be a multisport athlete.
That meant that the Monday immediately following The Game, Brady was off to track practice and competed in his first meet the following week.
Despite the exhausting schedule, Brady truly enjoyed playing both sports.
He eagerly looked forward to his freshman summer, when he would be going to England for three weeks to participate in the Harvard/Yale vs. Oxford/Cambridge meet–the oldest continuous international amateur athletic event in the world.
It was an event he had been looking forward to for a while. But then, tragedy struck.
The day before his plane was set to leave, Coach Turner passed away.
“It was very difficult,” he says. “You just tried to wipe it out as much as possible. [But] our head coach had to leave England to go to his funeral...it was a constant reminder. There were lots of “cheers to Paul” chants, and we were thinking about him a lot.”
The team was victorious in its coach’s honor, winning 14 of 20 events. Yet Turner’s passing remained on Brady’s mind.
“It made me reevaluate, made me think,” Brady says. “My freshman year was a little bit crazy, [and I thought], if I’m going to spend the next three years of my life here, what do I really want to be doing? At the end of the day, it came down to the fact that I really wanted to be involved in the track program.”
Despite his love for both sports, the exhaustion of his routine and the hit that his grades were taking made the hassle not worth it.
He knew he had to quit football.
Though today he has no regrets about that decision, there’s always that slight feeling of nostalgia every time he walks past Harvard Stadium.
“I miss it,” he admits. “Games were so much fun. I miss hitting people and getting hit. I still watch tons of football, eat it up. I love the sport.”
Yet his love for track and field soared to even greater heights as it presented new challenges.
Though he had focused on the shotput and the disc throw in high school, he had only competed in the weight throw during his first year at Harvard—a decision Brady wasn’t happy about.
“I hated it,” he says. “I threw it like 12 meters, which is not good. I was embarrased.”
His sophomore year, his new coach, Catherine Grace Erickson—who coached an NCAA-record holder in the weight throw—encouraged him to keep working at the event.
Erickson’s experience immediately appealed to Brady.
“I think it was a little difficult for him, when he started out, to really understand what impact he could have competing in the weight three years down the line, because he didn’t have much experience with it,” Erickson says. “It’s not something as easy as picking up a football and just throwing it; it’s a very unnatural event.”
By his junior year, Brady was finally buying into her advice.
“I kept telling him to trust the process, stay calm, and try to pick up one thing every day,” she says. “[I told him] by the end, you’re going to be in good shape...[and] that the weight and hammer would help his athleticism in the other events, because there’s a lot of crossover.”
The weight and hammer throws are now his favorite events—the major difference being that the hammer is thrown outdoors, the weight indoors.
He still loves the challenge the shotput provides and has also improved in the discus–so much so that his throw of 50.17 meters last year placed him 10th on Harvard’s all-time list.
“They compete for my heart a little bit,” Brady admits.
In 2009, he qualified for the IC4A Outdoor Track and Field Championship in all three heavy throw events (the shotput, discus, and hammer throw), a rare feat considering most competitors don’t do all three at once.
Brady’s heart is fully with track and field, both now and in the future.
“I want to keep training, to see where this hammer thing takes me,” he says. “I want to play it out, see what kind of gains I can make...hopefully I’ll be able to volunteer at our program, just try to stay involved.”
His coach would welcome him with open arms.
“We’ve been working towards that process from the beginning,” Erickson says. “I’m very excited about that; it’s going to be great...my goal now is to help him learn how to coach.He’s definitely worked hard and been very dedicated to the program, and it’s been a joy to work with him.”
But his girlfriend doesn’t want him to hurry into coaching just yet.
“Sometimes he’s kind of a natural coach, so my advice to him is to try to see things from the perspective of the athletes,” she says.
“I want him to try to sympathize with other people on the team and to remain in the college moment before he’s a coach,” she says.
Yet being a natural leader seems something that’s always been innately in Brady’s blood.
“He communicates very well—that’s one of his strengths when it comes to both being an athlete and a captain,” Erickson says.
“He believes he needs to be successful to fulfill his captainship, which makes him better.”
“He’s someone who people really look up to,” Boyle adds. “I think he’s a great role model, especially for the younger athletes. He has a way of leading by example. He’s always the first one there and the last one to leave practice, he’s always there for anyone who has questions about the sport, and I think that extends to the rest of his life too.”
A shower, a change of clothes, and back across the river. Dinner, studying (today he’s reading about Charlemagne and eighth-century government), more hanging out, then bed–ready to do it all again tomorrow.

Students wanting to grab a meal in a river House will now have to travel a little bit further after the Lowell House Committee announced the installation of new dining restrictions on Monday evening.
Effective immediately, no interhouse diners will be permitted to eat in Lowell House for lunch or dinner until 6:45 p.m. on weekdays and Sundays, and House residents will each be allowed to bring one guest to dine with them.
“We found that our dining hall was very overcrowded to the point that people who lived in Lowell couldn’t find seats in their own dining hall,” said Alex W. Brenner ’11, co-chair of the Lowell House Committee.
When the Lowell House Opera begins in mid-February, these new restrictions—which were voted into effect this past week—will be superseded by the annual Opera season restrictions, Brenner said. These stricter limitations do not allow for any interhouse diners, as dining hall space is limited by the presence of the Opera stage.
Brenner said that the new dining restrictions, which are supported by the House Masters, will be reconsidered by the House Committee while the Opera is in residence to determine whether they will continue once the Opera season is over.
Laura A. Freeman ’12, facilities manager of the Lowell House Committee, said her feelings about these restrictions are “kind of mixed.”
“I’m against restrictions, but [this one] is kind of necessary,” said Freeman, who said she likes bringing her friends to Lowell dining hall for meals. “It’s ridiculously crowded. People who live in Lowell [can’t] find seats.”
Lowell House general cook Stanley A. Ewing said he thinks these new restrictions will only delay the mealtime rush. He said that limiting interhouse diners to one guest per resident until 6:45 p.m. will only cause the large influx of students to come in later.
“I don’t like it, but I understand it,” said Lowell resident Shuo Huang ’09-’10. “Space really does become an issue, even with the interhouse restrictions.”
Huang recalled having to resort to dining in Winthrop in the past when his own dining hall became too crowded. He said he has not yet decided which other House will serve as his backup this season.
“I would like not to have to resort to [eating in other Houses],” Brenner said, “[but] I think it’s a necessary evil.”

Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, the leading cause of death among infants less than 12 months old in the U.S. may be linked to low levels of serotonin in brain tissue, according to researchers at Harvard-affiliated Children’s Hospital Boston.
In infants under a year old, SIDS manifests as an unexpected and sudden death that cannot be explained by autopsy or death scene investigation. The study discovered that children who die from this syndrome exhibit abnormalities in brainstem control of autonomic functions, such as breathing and heart rate regulation.
“Many people initially thought SIDS only occurred because the baby stopped breathing during sleep,” said researcher Hannah C. Kinney, a professor of pathology at Harvard Medical School and a neuropathologist at Children’s Hospital.
“The implication here is that SIDS is an intrinsic problem in the brainstem and a biological problem that is not a mystery, but something that can be studied by scientific means.”
The researchers at Children’s Hospital analyzed the brain stems of infants that died of SIDS in comparison to the brain stems of children that died of other causes.
Using various molecular techniques, researchers examined tissue samples for markers of serotonin and other hormones.
“The most consistent abnormality that we have found in our research is in levels of serotonin,” Kinney said.
The investigators found that serotonin levels were 26 percent lower in the tissue samples collected from infants that died from SIDS. The levels of tryptophan hydroxylase, an enzyme needed to make serotonin, were also 22 percent lower.
While Kinney said that there are currently no specific tests to detect abnormalities in serotonin levels, she encouraged parents to continue to ensure that their children’s breathing is uninhibited during sleep in hopes of preventing SIDS.

Politicians must listen closely to their constituents in order to fix American politics, Republican National Committee Chairman Michael S. Steele said in a speech at the Institute of Politics yesterday.
Speaking to a packed John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum, Steele said that politicians must work to understand the opinions of Americans from all sides of the political spectrum.
“You cannot lose sight of the fact that at this time the American people are talking very loudly,” Steele said. “I’ll do what my mama said when I was a young boy and shut up and listen.”
According to Steele, many of the problems with contemporary politics stem from the failure of politicians to understand the needs of their constituents.
“There’s a Chinese saying that says, ‘May you live in interesting times.’ It’s a pretty good saying until you realize it’s actually a curse,” Steele said. “Living in interesting times means that you can’t control it.”
In order to deal with the current shifting political landscape, Steele said that aspiring politicians must be honest with the public and be comfortable following others when necessary.
“The mission at hand is to understand first and foremost the land you’re on and how that ground is shifting and changing by the minute,” Steele said.
Harvard Republican Club President Mark A. Isaacson ’11 agreed with Steele’s conception of listening as key to successful political leadership.
“I think that it’s very true, and I hope that as chairman of the party he can make sure that the Republican candidates heading into 2010 are doing exactly that and also continue to do that once they get elected,” Isaacson said.
Kennedy School student Peter J. Witzler disagreed with the distinction Steele drew between building consensus and bipartisanship, which Steele called a “political fiction” and a “zero-sum game.”
“I don’t think politics has to be either a zero-sum game or a place where you have to give something up,” Witzler said. “There’s not a finite piece of pie that has to be split up.”
Other audience members were unconvinced by Steele’s proposed solutions for American politics.
“Three people asked in a different way about problems in American politics, and to each of them he just said, ‘That’s just politics,’” said Kennedy School student Dominic Maxwell. “I left thinking this man is part of the problem, not the solution.”
Steele’s visit particularly resonated for many Republican members of the audience because of Republican Senator-elect Scott P. Brown’s recent victory in Massachusetts.
“I definitely think bringing in the Republican Party chairman is bringing Harvard out of its comfort zone, which is a good thing,” said D. Scott Darnell, the vice-chair of the Kennedy School Republican Caucus, one of the sponsors of the event.

Harvard Medieval Art History Professor Jeffrey F. Hamburger embarked on a crusade last week to save a rare professorship at King’s College London from being eliminated due to budget cuts.
Hamburger sent an impassioned e-mail to department administrators at King’s College London protesting the university’s proposed elimination of their chair of palaeography—the study of ancient writing—as part of a 15 percent budget cut mandated by the British government for all British universities, according to David Ganz, professor of paleography at King’s College.
The paleography professorship is one of a projected 22 positions to be eliminated at King’s as a result of the budget cuts.
“Indeed, your assault on the Humanities in general seems part of a program to reduce King’s to a pauper or, perhaps, something closer to a vocational school,” Hamburger wrote in the e-mail to King’s College department administrators.
The paleography chair, according to Hamburger, is the English speaking world’s only established chair of paleography—an area where King’s “has traditionally played a leading role.”  Most American universities—including Harvard—do not have a formal program in paleography.
“This is an international resource that is being eliminated,” Hamburger said in a recent interview. “To see [the chair] eliminated with such disregard is just incredibly short-sighted.”
Hamburger also e-mailed other Medieval Studies professors at Harvard, encouraging them to write letters to King’s, though he said he is uncertain whether any of his colleagues followed suit.
King’s paleography chair is currently occupied by Ganz, an expert in early medieval manuscripts. Hamburger wrote in an e-mail that Ganz’s fate is now “up in the air.”
Hamburger said that students of history worldwide will feel the effects of the budget cuts at King’s College.
“Just as when biologists get upset when poachers kill the last specimen of a given species, so too medievalists get upset when one of the last positions in paleography gets eliminated,” Hamburger said.
Ganz wrote in an e-mail that faculty are “terrified and depressed” and students are “alarmed” because of the budget cuts, adding that he wishes that British newspapers would pick up the story.
Hamburger wrote in his e-mail to King’s College administrators that their decision to “eliminate the study of paleography in Great Britain” would represent “an unforgivable act of cultural iconoclasm, nihilism, philistinism and shortsightedness.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a baseball cap on his head and a “¡Sí se puede!” poster in hand, Derrick N. Ashong ’97-’98 appeared every bit the enthusiastic but uninformed young Obama supporter to a man wielding a video camera outside of the 2008 Democratic presidential primary debate in Hollywood, Calif.
The man proceded to pepper Ashong with questions expecting insubstantial responses. However, Ashong’s detailed and well-informed answers turned the video into a YouTube phenomenon that received over one million hits.
Two years later, the social entrepreneur and artist has taken his voice to the airwaves as the host of a new show on Oprah Radio entitled the “The Derrick Ashong Experience.”
The radio program, which first aired live from the Sundance Film Festival on Jan. 23, is a “mash-up of politics, pop-culture, social media, music, and the arts, informed by Ashong’s experiences and travels across the globe,” according a press release from Harpo Radio, Inc. Ashong, whose show will air every Saturday at 12 p.m and is also available on oprahradio.com, will host guests from a variety of fields, including politics and entertainment.
Ashong said he seeks to use the media to promote global change by inspiring a new generation to become involved and engaged in the discourse surrounding world issues.
“The mainstream media today often has another agenda beside the real search for truth,” Ashong said.
He said he believes that every person has the opportunity to contribute towards what is happening in the world and therefore strives to create content that can inspire and amplify people’s voices.
“This is the time to be counted,” Ashong said. “This is the beginning.”
The former Currier House resident, who was born in Ghana, graduated from Harvard College with a degree in African-American studies and founded the Black Men’s Forum. Ashong also met the members of his current band, Soulfège, while a member of Kuumba Singers.
“I saw my college experience as an opportunity to liberate my mind and spirit and to try and be great,” said Ashong, now 34.
Ashong began pursuing a PhD in African-American Studies and Ethnomusicology at Harvard, but left the program to pursue a career in media and entertainment.
Jonathan M. Gramling ’98, Ashong’s bandmate and friend, described Ashong as different from other artists because he is grounded in his community, history, and culture.
“Derrick sees the world as his community in a very real sense,” Gramling said.
Corny Koehl, executive producer of Harpo Radio, wrote in an e-mailed statement that Ashong’s show—Harpo’s first venture into social media—will attract a new audience and benefit talk radio at large.
“According to radio ratings service Arbitron, 90 percent of talk radio’s listeners are over age 35 and almost 90 percent are white. Derrick is an under 35, Harvard-educated, African-born, naturalized American citizen,” Koehl said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Early last year, Harvard Medical School professor Timothy Mitchison pulled aside two scientists employed in his lab. Without more funding soon, Mitchison told them, he would have to let them go.
Today, thanks to a grant funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act—President Barack Obama’s $787 billion stimulus package, which allocated $21.5 billion for research and development—the two still have their jobs.
Harvard has received more than $150 million in stimulus funding, which supported roughly 200 projects like Mitchison’s, according to Kevin Casey, the University’s chief lobbyist.
With spending from the National Institutes of Health declining in real terms over the past five years, competition for grant money has been fierce, and the percentage of successful NIH grant applications dropped from 32 percent in 1999 to 22 percent in 2008.
The recent injection of stimulus dollars, Harvard researchers and administrators say, has been an important lifeline.
“It’s been a little bit like Lipitor for the federal research system, unclogging the clogged arteries of research,” Casey says. “There is a lot of excitement around the country about the progress that will be made.”
But even as the Obama Administration proposed an additional increase in funding for NIH and National Science Foundation research grants in the 2011 budget this week, some researchers at the University are still concerned about the availability of financial support going forward.
‘SHOVEL-READY’ PROJECTS
Federal support for university-based research came amidst Harvard’s ongoing efforts to push for increased funding for the sciences.
University President Drew G. Faust testified before a Senate committee in 2008, stressing the importance of bolstering the NIH budget, which had flatlined since 2005.
Harvard lobbyists—working with a consortium of other universities and agencies while legislators drafted the stimulus bill last year—argued that research plays an important role in driving economic growth and development.
Basic science research creates jobs, and innovation serves as “a catalyst for ongoing stimulus,” Casey says.
By the time federal agencies had given additional research funding a green light, Harvard administrators and researchers had less than two years to submit grant proposals and spend stimulus money.
The Obama administration’s focus on “shovel-ready” projects meant that many Harvard researchers were able to move forward on projects that were not fully funded at the time.
Researchers awarded stimulus grants were able to start working “almost immediately,” Mitchison says—unlike in previous years, when they often waited a few months to receive the funds.
Mitchison and his team received a $999,932 grant from NIH in September to investigate which cancer drugs will be successful early in their development.
According to the stipulations of the grant, he will be required to submit quarterly progress reports, detailing the number of jobs created and saved and how he is spending the stimulus funds.
“It’s an unusual degree of scrutiny, but positive scrutiny,” Mitchison says.
To help Harvard researchers navigate the process of applying for and spending stimulus funds, Harvard’s first Vice Provost for Research David Korn ’54 and his staff launched a site with up-to-date information on new grants as they became available over the summer.
By October, Harvard had submitted more than 700 grant proposals—about 200 of which were awarded, totaling roughly $154 million.
“I don’t think I’ve had a direct, active role,” Korn says. “[The faculty] have to write the grants and go through a stringent peer review, but I think Harvard has done extremely well in the number of grants received.”
Harvard’s peer research institutions also took their share of the federal funds, with Johns Hopkins University receiving $160.3 million, Yale taking home $121 million, and Stanford netting $119 million.
SAVING JOBS
For Juraj Farkas and Shichun Huang, research associates at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, the jobs preserved by the stimulus funds are their own.
With a $53,000 grant from NSF, the pair embarked on their first independent research project in Sept. 2009. Using Harvard’s million-dollar mass spectrometer, they are studying calcium isotopes in rocks in order to better understand geological history.
Unlike many tenured professors, research associates—a position equivalent to a postdoctoral fellow—typically do not have a continuous stream of funding. Farkas says that obtaining grants as a junior researcher has always been difficult, but the stimulus package presented a unique opportunity.
“It’s always been hard to get funded,” Huang says. “We have to show them we’re able to do this.”
MOVING FORWARD
Astronomy professor Jonathan E. Grindlay was pleasantly surprised to receive a phone call in September notifying him of a $772,000 NSF grant award—$231,000 more than he asked for.
Grindlay had sought funding to digitize glass plate images of stars held at the Harvard Observatory—a project that will ultimately require $3 or 4 million, he says.
Though the Obama Administration’s 2011 budget proposal bolsters funding for NIH and NSF by 3.2 and 8 percent respectively, other agencies—including NASA—are unlikely to see a budget increase, Grindlay says.
As Grindlay, who currently employs about six people working part time in his lab, was not sure whether astrophysics research will be covered by the budget increases, he is seeking private donors to support the project’s completion.
“It seems domestic basic research is [a priority] and for that were pleasantly surprised,” Casey says after arriving in Washington Monday night to seek lawmakers’ support for Obama’s budget proposal. “We look forward to defending that on the Hill.”
He adds that research funding has had bipartisan support in the past.
For now, Mitchison has secured enough funding to continue his project for another five years—and hire an additional technician.
But he says he suspects that the current spike in federal investment in research and development is only temporary.
“At some point [research spending] can’t keep growing more than the economy,” he says. “I certainly would have other priorities, as well as science, as to how my tax dollars get spent.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Einat Wilf ’96 is Israel’s Scarlet O’Hara; at least, that is how her long-time friend Meredith E. Bagby describes the newly-elected Labor Party representative.
“Einat thought of herself as a Scarlet O’Hara. She had this strong association with the character, she even looked like her,” Bagby explains. “She is willing to work very hard to be a heroine for her country. That is her aspiration; that is who she is.”
Pursuing a degree at Harvard was part of her plan to become a leader in her country, and her experiences at the University helped shape her political course.
Elected to the K’Nesset, the Israeli parliament, on Jan. 10 to replace Labor Party representative Ophir Pines—who resigned when the liberal Labor party decided to join the conservative Netanyahu government—Wilf says that while naturally limited as part of the minority party, she believes that as one of only 120 members of the Israeli parliament she will have a large podium for her agenda, which is focused in large part on reforming the Israeli education system.
CORE REFORM
Drawing on her experience at Harvard, Wilf is interested in reforming the Israeli educational system, which is highly professionalized due to mandatory military service and splintered by numerous groups, such as the ultra-Orthodox, who demand the right to their own educational establishments.
“I am a big proponent of the core curriculum,” says Wilf. “I think it’s a great idea, and we should engage in the political battle to define the core curriculum, while preserving the proper margins for subcommunities to define their educational values and for   experimentation of new ideas and new subjects.”
Wilf says that there are four key ideas she would draw upon from her time at Harvard to shape Israel’s educational system: the liberal arts curriculum, diverse extra-curricular opportunities—Wilf tried her hand at everything from squash to DJing while in college—the “discipline  of learning,” and “a real-life example of how a private institution can actually support important social values.”
OFF TRACK
Despite her passion for affecting change, Wilf did not go directly into politics after college. After earning a bachelor’s degree in Government and Fine Arts, she worked for a few years in consulting at McKinsey & Co. before earning a MBA from INSEAD, an international business school in France, and a Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Cambridge.
Wilf talks about her years working in business as steps off the track of her ultimate path.
“Coming out of Harvard you have the expectation that somehow the world is just waiting for you to graduate to roll out the red carpet, and it’s very disorienting when they don’t,” she says. “The only ones that do are the consulting firms.”
GIVING BACK
But Wilf says she “snapped back” out of the jaws of consulting, and her subsequent political career is part of an effort to give back to her motherland and the hallowed halls of her alma mater.
“By realizing your capacities and going after your dreams, you are not just helping yourself but repaying a debt to this institutuion,” she says. Several of Wilf’s former professors affirm that their former pupil has lived up to the expectations of the University she admires.
“I remember how self-motivated she was and what a fine analytical mind she had,” says Emeritus Professor of Fine Arts Irene Winter.
Wilf turned in her thesis prospectus five months early, and the work, entitled “The Politics of Art: International Disputes over Ownership of Art and Cultural Artifacts,” “just sang” from the first draft, says Winter, who served as Wilf’s secondary thesis advisor.
“Einat Wilf had insights [in her thesis] that were 15 years ahead of her time,” Winter says.
Wilf delved into the relationship between national identity and cultural artifacts and the historical, structural, institutional, and ideological factors which account for contemporary international disputes over art and cultural artifacts.
“It will be interesting to me to see what ‘voice’ she adopts while in government service, and whether any of the issues on which she worked for this thesis emerge,” Winter says, “and then to see just how she brings her insights on national identity and culture to play without down-grading culture, as Israel and the Palestinian people move toward more productive discourse.”
For her part, Wilf sees a future for herself in the political arena—she hopes to remain there as long as she can.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Donations to American colleges and universities fell nearly 12 percent during the fiscal year ending last June, the steepest decline in fundraising since the mid-1970s and a direct result of the recent recession, according to a report released by the Council for Aid to Education yesterday.
Charitable giving to Harvard beat the national average, declining eight percent for a total of $602 million in donations.
Harvard had the second highest amount of donations of any college or university, following Stanford University’s total of $640 million.
Stanford and Harvard far outpaced the competition, with Cornell trailing in third place with $447 million.
The 20 universities with the largest donations ended the fiscal year with an average 11.8 percent decline in funds raised, barely beating the national average decline of 11.9 percent.
Liberal arts colleges were particularly hard hit by the decrease in charitable giving, seeing an 18.3 percent decline in gifts.
More recent University fundraising numbers than those in the report are not available, according to Ed Sevilla, executive director of strategic communications for the Office of Alumni Affairs and Development.
Tamara E. Rogers ’74, the University’s chief fundraiser, could not be reached for comment yesterday.
Martin Shell, vice president for university development at Stanford, told BusinessWeek yesterday that Stanford’s high level of donations was the result of strong relationships between the university and its alumni community.
But Ann M. Kaplan, the director of the survey, told The Crimson yesterday that although outreach by development offices is crucial for long term success, it is less integral in determining donation levels in the short term.
Charitable giving tends to correlate with the stock market and broader economic performance, Kaplan said. She said that this year’s decline in giving is not surprising given the past year’s economic performance.
The magnitude of the recent recession has raised fears among some economists that Americans might significantly alter their spending patterns, shifting away from the high levels of consumption that have characterized recent years of economic growth.
But John J. Havens, a professor at Boston College and an expert in philanthropy, said that such a potential shift is unlikely to affect gifts to universities in the long term.
“I don’t see this as a definite permanent or structural shift—most people that we deal with are still committed to their philanthropy,” Havens said.
“If there’s a major redistribution of wealth we could see a structural change, but I don’t see that as a major issue,” he said.

An event greater than the World Cup and World Series combined?
The men’s and women’s Ultimate Teams might make that argument about the Trouble in Vegas 2010, the largest college Frisbee tournament worldwide. The tournament welcomes 70 men’s and 60 women’s teams, and for the first time, Harvard’s Red Line and Quasar squads will be among those competing.
The Crimson teams have been talking about making the tournament a reality for a few years, and for the men’s team, which left for Vegas today, that dream has finally become a reality. The women’s team hits the “city built of hot sand, broken dreams, and five dollar lobster” tomorrow.
“It’s definitely going to be a wake-up call to see how we do against teams that have been practicing in the sunshine,” junior captain Christina Kelley said.
While Harvard’s varsity squads make cross country trips all the time, the task was more daunting for the student-run Ultimate Teams. Club sport and UC funding could not completely cover the costs of the trip, so the teams were forced to fundraise. Another obstacle involved the age of the athletes; for example, one must be 21 or older to rent a car.
But the costs are worth it for squads looking to make the College Bowl, the Nationals of Ultimate Frisbee. Last year, the women’s squad lost the qualifying game, finishing third in regionals—one spot shy of a Nationals berth.
“It was really disappointing but also awesome,” Kelley said. “Our goal is to make it to Nationals.”
And where better to start the journey than in Las Vegas?
It is, after all, “a city where you can get a happy ending, but only if you pay a little extra.”
Given the amount of fundraising the teams have had to do, it seems as if they have paid that extra.
