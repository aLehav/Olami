After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Thus far, the Obama administration has prided itself on the lack of scandals embroiling the president’s term in office, an achievement both notable and admirable given the size and aggressiveness of the government under this nation’s 44th leader. Political opponents have attempted to tie President Obama to misdeeds of Solyndra and Van Jones, but as of yet such endeavors have been futile. Unfortunately for both the president and the nation, this weekend’s big story that the Internal Revenue Service has unduly targeted Obama’s political opponents could and should leave an indelible mark on the president’s heretofore unsullied legacy.
The news that the IRS has gone after “social welfare groups” that have the words “patriot” and “tea party” in their names is incredibly damning, and it must not go unnoticed. While the person in charge of the IRS’s tax-exempt division, Lois Lerner, has passed the buck down to unnamed “low-level employees,” this ignominy allows Americans to hark back to the service’s shadowy and praetorian history as an agency frequently suborned to harass those with political agendas discordant to that of the Commander-in-Chief.
The tale of the attack dog IRS begins with the days of Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose IRS chief, Elmer Lincoln Irey, not only used the agency to prosecute Al Capone, but also engaged in investigative activities against former Republican Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon and FDR’s chief Democratic rival, Louisiana Governor Huey Long. Of course, the most renowned and nefarious chapter in the IRS history book dates to Richard M. Nixon, who ordered the institution at his disposal to probe his 1972 electoral opponent, George McGovern. It should not be forgotten that Nixon’s abuse of this executive power became, famously, an impeachable offense.
When politically conservative groups began complaining about having to fill out unprecedented questionnaires during the presidential campaign, the IRS brushed off the allegations as paranoiac, asserting, “Yes, I can give you assurances…There is absolutely no targeting.” The New York Times applauded the increased scrutiny of conservative outfits in a bold editorial entitled “The IRS Does Its Job.”
Yet, the IRS’s job is not to “bury [its enemies] in time and money,” as the Tea Parties characterize the ordeal. The IRS’s job is to collect taxes. That the nation’s purported “paper of record” would lampoon those that unjustly suffered from the IRS qua NKVD is despicable. During the Nixon administration, the American populace benefited from the so-called adversarial press’s obsession with uncovering the transgressions of the nation’s Republican leader. Now, with a Democrat in the White House, the fourth estate seems comfortable with its position as indifferent to the president’s malfeasance. Both Obama and The Times need to apologize for this depravity.
In his commencement address to Ohio State University, Obama glibly denounced those who warn about government overreach: “Unfortunately, you’ve grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate, sinister entity that’s at the root of all our problems ... They’ll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner.” He went on to characterize his critics as believing “that our brave and creative and unique experiment in self-rule is somehow just a sham with which we can’t be trusted.” Unfortunately, Obama has now given those opponents prime ammunition to continue making claims that his government actually cannot be trusted.
The admission from Lerner that the IRS has known of the service’s Tea Party targeting since 2011 demonstrates the extent to which the government can hide its ability to abuse its power. No one should overlook this imbroglio as run-of-the-mill or simply lamentable. When the IRS said “there were not partisan reasons behind this,” it was being mendacious. Yet, the reaction of an informed and guarded citizenry should not be partisan. As Harvard graduate Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. once reminded us, “We should be eternally vigilant against attempts to check the expressions of opinions that we loathe.” Democrats, Republicans, Tea Partiers, and Occupiers alike should be in unison in their uproar. If the government can silence holders of one political ideology, there is no stopping it from continuing on to others. Both Nixon and Lyndon B. Johnson used the IRS to target proponents of civil rights and protestors of the Vietnam War. Unless you agree with the administration on 100 percent of the issues (which, if that is the case, I am dying to meet you) your political beliefs might put you at the mercy of a dark and shady mechanism for quenching your freedom of expression.
Various public officials have called on Obama to apologize. A mea culpa is only the first step. Hopefully, this situation can bring to attention the dangers inherent in a politicized tax collector beholden to our nation’s leader. During the Nixon days, people took seriously the threat of IRS instigation. It was taken for granted, despite his insistence to the contrary, that Nixon “was a crook.” While those inside the White House wants to deify Obama as its “North Star,” the potentiality of corruption in his administration must not be overlooked. President Obama must proceed carefully if he doesn’t want to end up with an eerily Nixonian legacy of disgrace.

The upcoming capital campaign is an exciting and long overdue development. The last capital campaign ended in 1999, and our peer schools have raised record sums of money since then. This campaign is an exceptional opportunity to strengthen the University and develop our campus and programs for a world that is very different than it was 14 years ago. The University should aim high, not just in terms of the fundraising total but also in its priorities and vision for the future.
 There are few who doubt that this capital campaign is necessary. Many of our Houses have long since passed the point where quaint and charming turns into hopelessly outdated and, in some cases, borderline dilapidated. The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences shows real promise, but it needs more funding to grow. In a time of federal budget austerity, the new capital campaign will allow the University to fund crucial basic research even as the government fails to do so. There is so much that is great about Harvard and so much to be done.
 The performance of recent capital campaigns at our peer schools is encouraging, but their success underlines the urgency of this campaign. Stanford’s recent campaign aimed to raise $4.3 billion. Instead, it raised $6.23 billion. The Stanford Challenge, as the campaign was called, supported various education and research initiatives, including $2.33 billion earmarked specifically for seeking solutions to global problems. Yale managed to renovate its residential colleges largely without the help of a capital campaign, but that school’s  renovations put their residential amenities ahead of Harvard’s—a competitive disadvantage in the fight for the most talented college students. Harvard should not fall behind as our peers build up their fundraising.
 As Harvard determines the priorities for the campaign, administrators should give students and faculty a stake in the planning, prioritizing, and fundraising. This campaign will be a University-wide effort, so it is crucial to involve the entire University community. Students and faculty have day-to-day knowledge that will be crucial in planning big-ticket items like House renewal and other campus improvements.
 Above all, the University should be bold. Some projects, like the roughly $1 billion House renewal, are expenditures of necessity. As important as they are, those projects will not define the future of the University. It is projects like the new developments in Allston, an undergraduate student center, funding for cutting-edge research, and many more projects still to be announced that will advance the University’s mission and help the University adapt to an ever-changing world. The University’s goals should reflect tremendous optimism and high hopes for the future.

“I don’t know why I’m here.”
I have only heard this statement in a few settings at Harvard. I’ve heard it said in philosophy courses, as students try to comprehend the upper limitations of their cognitive abilities. I’ve heard it said at the Hong Kong, as students try to comprehend the lower limitations of their cognitive abilities. And I’ve heard it said in Annenberg, as students try to compare their cognitive abilities to those of others.
The first two make some sense to me: One is a very sobering thought we all probably have at one point or another. The other is much less sober, but still understandable. The third situation though is something I’ve come to realize, personally, can be harmful and debilitating—the notion of comparing talents in college.
Healthy comparisons are everywhere. Historians draw comparisons with the past to talk about the future. Politicians compare and weigh policies. Our economics—the competition of products, job applications, and prices—is based in the realm of comparison. Even this sentence is being used in a comparative fashion.
And comparisons are nowhere more prevalent than in our schools. Students, even if not graded on a curve, compete for grades on relative scales. They try to impress their professors among their peers for recommendations. They make arguments in their papers and exams by weighing sources and logic. They compete to earn spots in performance, writing, and social groups. And these comparisons, while sometimes harsh, can often lead to personal growth.
Probably the main source of comparison in the college experience, however, stems from its birth—the admissions office. Admissions is an institution based solely in comparison: Among a batch of high-school kids who could be deserving of attending a university, the office only selects a certain portion whose presence on campus, comparatively, will contribute most to the university’s well-being. But, especially at private colleges, this comparison can be extremely difficult. When schools like Harvard are committed to building classes based, at least in part, on economic, ethnic, and geographic diversity, the process is like comparing apples to orangutans. Sure, they both taste great. But beyond that, there aren’t many similarities between them to evaluate on the similar scales, making some admissions decisions seem arbitrary.
And this leads to the root of the problem at Harvard—that one weird speech at Visitas. Even though I, like this year’s class, skipped out on Harvard’s visiting weekend, I’ve heard about the infamous speech given every year to the admitted students, which welcomes them by bragging about the attributes of their peers. It apparently goes something like this: “Among your class of 2,024 students, there are 2,400 valedictorians, 50 debate champions, 12 former clowns, five of the original cast of High School Musical 2, Batman (which one of you he is, we still don’t know), and a rubber ducky with a surprisingly high GPA.”
The speech basically amounts to a statement of, “Look at all the apples and orangutans we have compared and compiled for you.” Later on, you find out that among those 50 debate team champions there can be an opera singer; that among those clowns, there is a card-counter; that the rubber ducky has high aspirations for her (didn’t know what the PGP was here) acting career. And, for me at least, it was hard not to feel a bit envious.
Historians, politics, economics, and schooling had pushed me to compare. For some reason, when the zeal of freshman fall wore off, I felt I wasn’t good enough. I wrote for some publications, but didn’t do much else. I began trying hard activities I knew I didn’t like in a test of self-worth. A lot of things began to matter less than they used to, and I got less and less happy. Soon, I felt that there was no community for me to be a part of. I was merely one of the admissions office’s arbitrary mistakes—one of those in Annenberg who questioned their seats at its tables. Although I probably would not have admitted it (or admitted myself), I felt I could never be good enough.
And I was right. I can never be good enough. That’s because there is no such thing as “good enough.” The reason that any college gives admission to students is because they stand out. They’re different in some way that makes them valuable to a university. How they succeeded in their own lives depended on their own definition of success, which was different from many others’. I realized that I was applying the competitive drive that helped me get here in the wrong way—I had to test myself again and pursue my own goals, without worrying about the rest.
At some point, I finally let go. It all fell back into place. I enjoyed the differences more in those around me rather than envied them, and I enjoyed more of the activities I already knew I liked doing or discovered. The pressure subsided, and I finally felt more of a belonging—I was being myself again, which was the same self that the admissions office first selected to “belong” in the class of 2016.
As strange as it seems, differences are what bring students together. And it can be only through embracing and learning from those differences, rather than comparing them, that students will remain together. I’ve tried both ways, and trust me—it doesn’t even compare.

Deathbed narrations of decadent men fascinate us. These haunted, semi-lucid ravings attract us for their reflective melancholy that dissolves the gaudy veils of wealth and power around rotten cores of misgivings and dejection. Orson Welles created the anguished Citizen Kane who can only call for his childhood sled in his last minutes, and Carlos Fuentes set an entire novel in the dying words of the megalomaniacal tycoon Artemio Cruz. Seeing the finality of our end, often rudely unannounced, brings our suppressed uncertainties to the fore.
Last week, the Obama administration came to see its inevitable irrelevance arrive much sooner than expected. Rather than waiting for the traditional two-year long festival of gridlock and dysfunction celebrated after a President’s last midterm election, the lame duck has unexpectedly begun quacking earlier. Inconvenient scandals, whether real or imagined by obdurate Republicans, along with a disconnected and distant messaging style, will leave the Obama administration only able to communicate powerless swan songs while it waits for its termination.
“I’d call it a cover-up,” Senator John McCain gleefully accused the administration after embarrassing revelations of extensive revision of Susan Rice’s talking points in the aftermath of the attacks in Benghazi that resulted in the death of four Americans, including the American Ambassador J. Christopher Stephens. For a while, it seemed that the Benghazi attacks were the obsessive focus of Republicans and the echo chambers of Fox News because both desired a cudgel to batter Obama’s national security record. Now, like man-children discovering presents on Conspiracy Theory Christmas, Republicans suddenly have an embarrassing inconsistency to exploit.
The IRS, no one’s favorite government agency to begin with, recently apologized to Tea Party and Patriot groups for additional auditing on the sole basis of their group’s name. This actualizes and gives some flimsy support to the parasitic conservative mythology where Obama is a Kenyan socialist, government overreach will destroy capitalism, and Christians are an oppressed majority, as Sean Hannity recently implied when he baselessly claimed that the administration was “cleansing” the military of Christians.
These scandals themselves might not be enough to derail a presidency, but in the hands of the reputable bunch of self-interested Congressmen, it will surely give some legitimate standing to delay needed legislation for political grandstanding. The House recently spent two full days debating an utterly uncontroversial bill on the Federal Helium Program, eventually passing 394-1, in order to avoid actually doing its job of addressing salient issues like unemployment.
Republicans in Congress have made unprecedented, irresponsible use of the filibuster to block nominees to critical government positions like Secretary of Labor or director of the Environmental Protection Agency. After childishly disrupting the government, waiting for a screw-up, Republicans disingenuously blame government in order to legitimize further cuts and disruptions. As Grover Norquist, the anti-tax demigod, tellingly said, “I don’t want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.”
And so President Obama has to realize that the mountains of Congressional hearings, the column inches and sound bites devoted to faux indignation will effectively entomb a Congress that has seemed intent on walling itself off from the public since its election. The prospect of Congress passing actually progressive bills seemed dismal to begin with—expanded background checks were filibustered despite having the support of 90 percent of the public, and the ostensibly bipartisan immigration reform bill was buried under 300 amendments.
The resurfacing of the debacle surrounding the Guantanamo Bay detention center, which remains open despite Obama’s strident campaign pledge, highlights the infuriating inefficacy of the administration. Scapegoating Republican obstinacy is a liberal pipe dream that ignores the real failures in the administration’s disdain for outreach. The president’s recent so-called charm offensive, one of those oxymorons flooding the Beltway lexicon, is a step in the right direction, but too little too late.
Instead, seeing the writing on the wall, the administration may begin to wonder what could have been done differently: a less controversial, better-argued healthcare bill, avoiding the detrimental austerity of the debt ceiling, sidestepping the self-harm of sequestration. Arriving at the recognition of his own irrelevance, as the media whips itself into 2016 frenzy and Congress stonewalls, President Obama should ponder the mistakes of his term and consider what could have been done differently.
As the poet John Greenleaf Whittier once wrote, “Of all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are these: ‘It might have been!’”

As the Harvard women’s rugby team transitions to varsity status next year, the Crimson will have an experienced leader at the helm of the emerging program. The Harvard Athletic Department announced the hiring of Sue Parker last Wednesday. Parker will take over as head coach of the varsity team starting in the fall of 2013.
“We’re all very excited to start working with her,” team president Brandy Machado said. “We met with her in the interview process, and we were all very impressed. She has an impressive resume, [and] she’s coached at the national level. We’re confident she’ll be a good coach for us.”
Parker will bring a wealth of experience to Cambridge this coming fall. Parker most recently served as the head coach of Navy women’s rugby from 2002-2008 and 2011-2013, where the club team was a top national contender, recently advancing to the Final Four of the 2013 National Championships.
Prior to her coaching days, Parker represented the United States on the women’s national team from 1997-2000. From 2007-08, she served as the assistant coach for the USA Women’s 7s Rugby National Team, before being tabbed head coach the following year.
As a part of the nation-wide coaching search, current team members were involved in the process of selecting the varsity program’s first head coach.
“It was a really big job search, so the Athletic Department did a lot of it,” junior co-captain Xanni Brown said. “But we got to interview four candidates. We met with Sue in March [and] we’re all really impressed with her. Coming from Navy, she has a ton of experience and a really great record there, so we’re super excited for her to be integrated into this program.”
Parker also serves as the Chair of the USA Women’s Rugby Women’s Strategic Committee, and helped draft a vision statement promoting women’s rugby to NCAA varsity status. She also serves as a member of the USA Rugby Women’s NCAA Committee. Parker will be at the helm of the Crimson’s transition from club to varsity.
“We have been gearing up for this [transition to varsity] since my freshman year when we won the Division II national championship,” Brown said. “The next thing we set our sights on was going varsity. We think we’re ready to represent this school at that level.”
Women’s rugby will become Harvard’s 42nd varsity sport and 21st for women, the highest totals of any university in either category.
“We’re looking forward to some changes next year when we go varsity,” Brown said. “We’ll be in the actual varsity weight room for season conditioning. We’ll have access to trainers, and field time for practice. And we’ll be asking more of our athletes, too.”

A computer science concentrator and Harvard Innovation Lab regular, Zachary Hamed ’14 has been selected as one of 22 2013 Thiel Fellows. The fellowship awards $100,000 to 22 young people from the ages of 17-20 to continue entrepreneurship projects related to science and technology.
“Hearing back from [the Thiel Fellowship] was so exciting,” Hamed said. “It’s very competitive and the other students who were out there are brilliant.” Hamed, an inactive Crimson news editor, will spend at least two years away from the College working with an established network of mentors that extends into Silicon Valley.
Created by Peter A. Theil, the founder of PayPal and one of the first investors in Facebook, the fellowship pays students to leave college and start their own companies.
The son of an elementary school teacher and a computer programmer, Hamed hopes to apply his computer science skills and vested interest in education to design tools to enrich K-12 teaching and learning. Hamed said that he is currently focusing on a project that would provide teachers with supplemental income.
“Teachers are underpaid given the importance of their jobs, and how much time they spend in the classroom,” he said. “It might be cool for regular people to back teachers and incentivize them to achieve those milestones in their classroom.”
The idea stemmed from conversations that he initiated with current and former teachers, among them classmates from a course that he took at the Graduate School of Education last year.
At the College, Hamed devotes much of his time to developing ideas at the i-lab. His mentors said that they are proud and eager to see the results of his entrepreneurial ambitions.
“He’s extremely talented, and he’s got a level of start-up acumen and maturity that is special given his stage in his career,” said i-lab Director Gordon S. Jones.
Hamed’s past projects have included an iPhone application that allows teachers to scan the barcodes of books to determine reading levels for their students and an app that he likened to TurboTax for financial aid.
Hamed credited CS50 and Hack Harvard—a January Term program where students workshop computer science projects—with being his first exposures into entrepreneurship on campus.
“Entrepreneurship and start-ups are the only sector where somebody can come in and be 20 years old...and try to be taken seriously,” Hamed said.
Jones said that Hamed is part of a select group of students who he credits with giving the i-lab its cohesive University character. Hamed built a check-in system that is currently used within the center.
“We’ll miss having Zach around the i-Lab because he’s got such a great personality, and he’s always cheerful, and he brings a joy to us,” said Neal A. Doyle, i-lab coordinator.

UPDATED: May 13, 2013, at 11:23 a.m.
Eighty-one Harvard undergraduates were honored with the Thomas T. Hoopes Prize for outstanding scholarly work or research, Harvard announced Friday.
The winning projects, most of which were senior theses, were selected from a pool of nominations by students’ faculty supervisors. Hoopes winners are awarded $4,000 each and their nominators receive $1,000.
Aaron J. Deutsch ’13 was among the many recipients who expressed pride at the recognition.
“It is certainly a big honor, and I’m just really glad that all of the hard work I put into it was recognized by this committee,” he said.
After learning that his roommate was selected, Andrew K. Cohen ’13 checked his email and realized that he had won as well.
“I wasn’t expecting it at all, so I was completely floored. It was awesome,” he said.
After learning of his award, Christopher A. Devine ’13 emailed his principal investigator and postdoctoral advisor.
“There were lots of exclamation points involved,” he said.
Reflecting on the Hoopes recognition, Cohen said that the process of writing his thesis was even more valuable to him than the award.
“It was first the time in my academic year I enjoyed the process of doing a rigorous assignment,” he said.
William M. Rafey ’13 also mentioned the rigors of writing a thesis.
“The hardest part about thesis-writing is not the fact that it’s so long but that you realize it’s senior year and you realize you won’t see your friends in the same place again,” he said. “The opportunity cost is high.”
Deutsch nevertheless recommended that every undergraduate write a thesis.
“As long as you find a project you’re excited about and an advisor you’re comfortable with, and who you can maintain good relationship with...it’s definitely a rewarding experience,” he said.
Andres A. de la Llera Kurth ’13 said that being awarded the Hoopes Prize has special significance coming from the underrepresented field of engineering sciences.
“Engineering and computer science do not appear too often in [Hoopes Prize winners’ lists]”, he said, noting that there were no engineering or computer science concentrators among this year’s Phi Beta Kappa Junior 24.
Kurth built a low-cost medical device meant for eye cataract surgery. He said his interest in the topic stems from his background in Chile, where cataracts are a significant health problem. His prototype worked successfully on fish eyes, and he said he hopes to patent his device by the end of the year.
“There are so many incredible theses written every year and to be selected out of those is really humbling,” Devine concluded.
A full list of winners is listed below:
Christian C. Anderson ’13, Hana Bajramovic ’13, Aditya Balasubramanian ’13, Devin R. Bean ’13, Zachary N. Bernstein ’13, Raj A. Bhuptani ’13, Nicholas F. Brazeau ’13, Seth H. Cassel ’13, Yi J. Chow ’13, Andrew Cohen ’13, Bradley L. Craig ’13, Ashok K. Cutkosky ’13, Carl Daher ’13, Lauren Dai ’13, Andres A. de la Llera Kurth ’13, Aaron J. Deutsch ’13, Christopher A. Devine ’13, Louis R.
