After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Aryan can fly. No one knows how, or why, but not only can the lead character of Kornél Mundruczó’s “Jupiter’s Moon” rise above the ground, he is practically invulnerable. In the opening sequence of this parable, Syrian refugee Aryan (Zsombor Jéger) is shot by a cop as he trespasses into Hungary, and finds himself floating upwards, spinning lazily. Perhaps Stern (Merab Ninidze), his newfound benefactor with questionable morals, is right: Aryan may be an angel. It doesn’t matter how he can fly, in the end, just as it doesn’t matter how one finds faith—just so long as one gets there, that’s alright.
Or maybe not. “Jupiter’s Moon” is thematically muddled. Mundruczó certainly wants to make some statement about faith, either Christianity or a broader spirituality. Aryan is laden with references to Christ—he comes back to life after being shot, his father is a carpenter, he figuratively goes underground for three days, he walks on water—and through their interactions, he teaches Stern how to find redemption for his sins. What exactly Stern learns from their time together, however, is unclear. Has he gone from a skeptic to a cynical profiteer, and finally to a true believer? The audience never learns.
Mundruczó’s feelings on Europe’s immigration crisis, on the other hand, are anything but unclear. The opening scene is a terrifying look at what refugees face even after making it to the continent, and Aryan is faced throughout the film with all sorts of intolerance from the local Hungarians. One particularly gratifying scene depicts him literally turning a skinhead’s apartment upside–down, while another includes a brief but touching description of his former home in Homs.
This clarion call for empathy, however, is somewhat muted. For a start, Aryan does not have much of a character arc. Stern teaches him confidence, both in his powers and in navigating “society”—i.e. European society. Beyond that, however, the most striking change in Aryan’s character takes place the moment he lifts off the ground. Stern is the one with the redemption story, the true reformation of an antihero; Aryan is just the good guy with superpowers who helps him down that path.
Even more problematic is the treatment of Aryan’s own beliefs. We know he is Muslim, but only because he denies Stern’s repeated offer of a drink. Mundruczó takes his one Muslim main character (who isn’t a terrorist), and promptly saddles him with explicitly Christian motifs. The audience learns next to nothing about Islam or Aryan’s personal practice—not even whether or not there are angels in Islam (there are). Mundruczó seems to be aiming for an advocacy of broader spirituality—Stern at one point comments that people no longer look up, Heavenwards—then why include these callouts to the story of Jesus, especially if the main character is not a Christian?
From a purely cinematic standpoint, “Jupiter’s Moon” has much to offer a discerning viewer. Marcell Rév’s cinematography is gorgeous and pitch-perfect; the aesthetics of every shot match the contents. He displays his mastery of the long take with breathtaking set pieces, defying gravity and the viewer’s sense of direction as Aryan spins and bobs through the air. Rév can also lay claim to the title of greatest car chase ever put to film, especially impressive given that one of the vehicles looks like a twenty-year-old sedan. In one glorious shot, the camera follows Stern and Aryan’s desperate escape from the police, never sacrificing clarity for pure thrills or vice versa.
The title of the film is a reference to Europa, a moon of Jupiter said to have a saltwater sea that may contain life. Mundruczó wants to claim that the wave of refugees that has fled to Europe is an opportunity, that it creates the conditions for ‘new life.’ This simplistic, Euro-centric vision of the situation drives the problems that lie at the heart of “Jupiter’s Moon.” The film is best enjoyed in moments—Aryan’s time in the sky, the more playful scenes he shares with Stern, and of course Stern’s own dry wit. When taken as a whole, it is clear that the scope of Mundruczó’s vision, epic as it is, is not enough to capture clearly such a complex and troubling crisis.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Much of what could be boring in “120 Battements par Minute (120 Beats per Minute),” written, edited, and directed by Robin Campillo, is not. The film, which follows AIDS activists in the early ’90s, starts with a weekly meeting of Act Up-Paris, the first for the protagonist Nathan (Arnaud Valois). As members debate a recent action some view as too extreme, shots of the discussion are intercut with the demonstration itself, illustrating the points being made. A potentially dull political meeting is made exciting and illuminating by sharp dialogue and smart editing. Unfortunately, Campillo seems to have lost his touch as an editor by the end of the film, and what begins as a sharp, political portrait slowly morphs into a dragging personal drama.
These weekly meetings are how Nathan and the viewer are introduced to the colorful cast of activists—Sean (Nahuel Pérez Biscayart) and Sophie (Adèle Haenel), some of the radical members of Act Up, and Thibault (Antoine Reinartz), the more conservative chairman of the group. Through these and other characters, Campillo is able to represent a wide variety of opinions and information on issues related to the AIDS epidemic.
Act Up-Paris’ main opponent in “120 Battements par Minute” is Melton Pharma—a drug company that first delays the release of a potentially important new medication for those living with AIDS, then only manufactures a limited amount. Campillo depicts other marches and actions, but the most memorable by far of all of them is a raid of Melton’s offices early on, as the activists try to steal the results of a clinical trial. This sequence includes many striking visuals, such as a balloon full of fake blood bursting against the company’s logo, and the stakes of the sequence are crystal clear.
As the film goes on, however, Campillo spends less and less time on political action and meetings. When he does, it can be hard to understand exactly what is being discussed, and as a big piece of each character is their political selves, they start to blend together somewhat. The film’s focus shifts to the developing romance between Nathan and Sean, as well as Sean’s battle with AIDS.
At first, Campillo balances the political and the personal well. Sean and Nathan’s conversations in between sex add color and urgency to the activism, and Sean’s declining health paints a brutal portrait of the effects of AIDS and indifference. However, many of their scenes together drag on too long, or fail to give the viewer any deeper understanding of these people and their struggle. “120 Battements par Minute” runs for well over two hours, and one can easily pinpoint scenes that could be cut or shortened—multiple lengthy sex scenes, protests that amount to nothing, and an unexplained conflict between Thibault and Sean, for a start.
Another culprit of the extended duration is the use of slow motion. From dance parties to political rallies, it pops up all over the film for little rhyme or reason. One of the worst offenders is a scene at a gay pride parade, chock full of slo–mo dancing and chanting. This scene adds so little to the film to begin with, and to lengthen it with slo-mo is a crime. It produces some interesting shots, but far from remarkable enough to merit the screen time.
At one point during the parade, Nathan falls over. For a little while, the viewer is left wondering: Has he been infected? The answer seems to be no, but there is little resolution for this and other puzzling questions. Most frustratingly, Campillo never divulges the results of any of the activism in the film. Several successes are implied, but never stated directly, and although the grand finale is a protest, it matters far more to the personal storyline than to the political.
With “120 Battements par Minute,” Campillo has the start of an engaging and dramatic tale of Act Up-Paris in the ’90s. Unfortunately, he forces the personal and political storyline to compete for screen time, rather than having them reinforce each other. With the Thibault and Sean storyline, he begins down a far more interesting path than the one he ends up taking—how ideological differences can strengthen or tear down friendships and romances. He has a deft hand in crafting engaging weekly meetings, and some of his dialogue—such as “This could be my last Gay Pride”—creates spine-tingling empathy. Instead, he gradually turns the film into a dull romance, unimproved by the dramatic political backdrop.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Not since "Babe" has a pig been such a lovable character, but Okja is no ordinary pig. Nor indeed, is "Okja" an ordinary film. Bong Joon-ho’s latest feature follows the titular, genetically modified pig and her human caretaker Mija (Seo Hyun Ahn) through the world of corporate greed and animal–rights activism. Every aspect of the film, from the characters to the costumes, is over the top, but the bond between Mija and Okja grounds this often farcical satire.
On their journey, the pair encounter two opposing organizations, both trying to use Okja for their own purposes. The first of these is the Mirando Corporation (likely a dig at Monsanto), with its vain and temperamental CEO, Lucy Mirando (Tilda Swinton, also playing Lucy’s twin sister Nancy). Okja is part of Mirando’s ten-year-long beauty pageant, purported to be a competition to see who can raise the best superpig. Mija and her guardian Hee Bong (Byun Hee Bong), win the competition, but Mija wants to keep Okja for herself. Mirando refuses, and takes her friend to New York for a promotional parade.
Assisting Mija in her attempts to protect Okja is the Animal Liberation Front, an eclectic group of non–violent activists led by Jay (Paul Dano). The ALF is both a delightful send–up of hyper-conscious political activists and an appreciative look at how far some are willing to go for their beliefs. Although they want to help Mija and Okja, they also want to use them; after saving them from Mirando in Korea, they allow Okja to be recaptured, albeit with a hidden camera to document Mirando’s abuse.
Bong never likes to create a forgettable character—nearly everyone on both sides is given some moment to express their weirdness. These are often the funniest in the film, such as Silver (Devon Bostick), an ALF member so devoted to reducing his footprint he barely eats, and is often on the verge of passing out. The stars shine as well under Bong’s direction. Swinton is just as madcap as in her role in “Snowpiercer,” lying through her teeth to the public while trying to maintain an impeccable image for herself and her company. Dano fills the role of charming leader with the hint of an edge well, keeping his memorable merry men in line as they question their absolutist credo. Ahn delights as she defies all who come between her and Okja.
“Okja” is a fast-paced film, always shifting in tone. Much of the film is too over the top to be taken seriously, especially scenes with the ALF, but Bong at times swerves in a much darker direction. He includes a scene in which Okja is forced to breed with another superpig, as well as a horrifying tour through a slaughterhouse. These moments exist only to serve Bong’s message—against corporate greed, wild genetic experimentation, and animal cruelty of all kinds.
Bong’s ideas aren’t complicated, with the activists coming out as absolutely good (despite some mistakes) and Mirando being portrayed as totally unethical. “Okja” doesn’t end perfectly happily, but he reminds the audience that in this world where so much is corrupt, one needs to find comfort in the small victories. Bong is an ideological filmmaker, but the ride to his inevitable conclusion is such a varied, enjoyable experience that this oversimplification is easy to forgive.

Agnès Varda may well be done making movies, but “Visages Villages (Faces Places)” gives audiences plenty to hope for. Not only is it clear that the brilliant and playful mind that has made Varda into the living legend of cinema that she is remains undimmed, but she has found for us a new guard, ready to step into the light. Her partner in the film is an anonymous French photographer and visual artist called JR. He has achieved renown in his own right—his first film, ‘Women Are Heroes’, was in Cannes in 2010—but his collaboration with Varda sends him to the forefront of visual art.
The film takes the form of an unlikely buddy comedy, as Varda, 88, and JR, 33, travel around the French countryside in JR’s van/mobile photo booth. They find empty walls in small towns, and find an image with which to beautify them. On a row of empty houses, they paste the photos of the miners who once lived there. Around the corner from a café, they erect a picture of one of its baristas, parasol in hand. This type of art is JR’s specialty, and he and Varda work together on each piece.
All along their trip, there are signs of progress, of leaving the past behind. Varda and JR celebrate those who have moved forward, recognize those who have stayed behind, and remind us of those who have been forgotten. A farmer who is able to work 2000 acres by himself gets a portrait on the side of his barn, while another who refuses to burn the horns off her goats is honored with a massive image of one of her animals. At other times, the pair are there simply to beautify, as in the factory they decorate with fish and group photos of the workers.
At every stop, Varda and JR interview a diverse and interesting group of people, from a church bellringer to a man one day from retirement. They clearly went into “Visages Villages” with little planned, but the openness to discovery marks the work of both artists. Individually, they go into the world ready to document and expand upon what they find. Together, that instinct is only amplified.
Of course, Varda and JR sometimes just talk. Sitting in front of beautiful landscapes, or just in Varda’s kitchen, they discuss ar or the film they are making, and engage in some playful verbal sparring. One subject that comes up repeatedly is Varda’s age, and declining sight. One of the most striking moments in the film is a shot of people holding up letters, sized and arranged to look like a vision chart. The bottom, smaller letters, are blurred out, while only the largest remain clear. Still unsatisfied, Varda asks them to shake the letters up and down. She then turns to the camera and says that this is what her vision looks like.
“Visages Villages” is a film like no other; less a neat story than a series of vignettes connected only by the fascinating personalities that have created them. It is first and foremost a celebration—of the passing of time, the fading of the old, and rise of the new. No easy and simple truths are forced upon the audience, and the pair come to no real conclusion. They are explorers in art, uninterested in such things. For Varda, this may be her last outing, and she makes it count.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thomas M. Lauderdale ’92 strutted through Harvard Yard in a fashionable Betsey Johnson dress and clutched an ironic Hello Kitty lunch box. While other Harvard students may have attempted to circumnavigate the visitors that throng the Yard, Lauderdale scared them off with a crack of his leather whip.
To those who know Lauderdale, the scene is perhaps unremarkable: his days at Harvard were marked by outrageous parties, eccentric stunts, and passionate political protests.
“I was very different than many people in my high school,” Lauderdale said, though he added that he channeled his quirkiness into a successful campaign for student body president.
This feeling of isolation fell away once he moved to Adams House.
The class of 1992 was among the last to rank housing preferences before the system was fully randomized to eliminate self-segregation. Lauderdale was ecstatic when he received his first-choice house. For him, Adams House was the obvious and only option.
“Adams was a self-selecting group of people. It was the artists, the internationals, the freaks and the gays,” Lauderdale said.
Within Adams, Lauderdale was able to build a close-knit group of friends, including China F. Forbes ’92, a current member of Pink Martini. He described Adams House as having a distinct culture in which he thrived.
“It was like going to a completely different school from the rest of the Harvard campus,” Lauderdale said. “It gave us permission to go further than one would ever normally go if one were living in a regular community.”
Lauderdale quickly became one of the social bastions of the House, particularly after he created a Tuesday comedy show called Cafe Mardi. “He was responsible for the entire social life of Adams House,” Tanya Selvaratnam ’92 said.
Others point to the parties of which Lauderdale was an integral member. “Thomas created a space in which people were excited to be together and had a good time,” said Gabrielle C. Burton ’92.
Some attribute the infamous closure of the Adams pool to a party Lauderdale hosted. “Everyone got in the pool and it was great fun until a very aggressive senior tutor shut it down and then the pool shut down,” Selvaratnam said.
But Lauderdale was not socially confined to his House. One year, he hosted an Adams-Eliot party in an effort to initiate inter-House collaboration. While Adams was famous for its counterculture, Eliot was seen as the “prep house.”
“There was a cultural exchange,” Lauderdale said. “It was the beginning idea of diplomacy, having fun and building bridges despite our differences.”
Lauderdale considered this type of exchange a central pillar of Pink Martini. The band’s overall goal is promoting “global inclusivity and collaborative spirit,” according to its website.
“It’s no surprise to me that he went on to be so successful with Pink Martini, because he’s someone one who sees overlaps and combines influences,” Burton said.
Others add that this ability to build connections is facilitated by the multiple languages in which Pink Martini performs. Pink Martini’s ninth, and most recent, studio album, “Je dis oui!” features eight languages, including French, Farsi, Xhosa, and Arabic.
“Because they sing the songs in so many different languages, they are able to appeal to people’s humanity more,” Selvaratnam said. “Pink Martini embodies the importance of bringing together cultures and finding commonality where others might seek to find difference.”
Lauderdale and his Adams House coterie were frequently involved in political activism.
“Every week there would be a protest at the John Harvard statue. We would protest whatever it was that we were protesting, whether it was divesting from South Africa or ROTC on campus,” Lauderdale said.
Selvaratnam fondly recalls the time she and Lauderdale protested about final clubs, which would continue to be a divisive issue.
Another day, Selvaratnam and Lauderdale organized a concert attended by then-Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III. “I recited Pablo Neruda love poems while Thomas accompanied me on the piano,” Selvaratnam said. “We certainly had a lot of fun.”
But Lauderdale’s political activism endured beyond Mount Auburn St. After graduating from Harvard College, he returned to his hometown of Portland, Oregon, ostensibly to launch a mayoral campaign.
This mission was short-lived, and he soon joined a group opposing a 1994 proposed amendment to the Oregon constitution that would render homosexuality illegal. The culmination of a week of protests he organized was supposed to be a public concert performed by a well-known band.
But the band cancelled at the last moment, so Lauderdale did what he had perfected during his four years at Harvard—he swung into action.
“I threw on a cocktail dress and started Pink Martini. That’s how it started,” Lauderdale said.
The band’s popularity in Portland grew, and Pink Martini came to be known as the stock band to perform at politically progressive events. As Lauderdale started to consider performing as a viable career, he recalled his friend and neighbor in Adams House: Forbes, who he described as the “queen of the Adams dining hall.”
“Remembering all the fun I had with her, and remembering how smart she is, and how many different languages she spoke, I at one point called her. She moved from New York to Portland,” Lauderdale said.
Since that day, the band has expanded in size and fame. Lauderdale has capitalized on his ability to unite unlikely audiences, just as he did in his days at Harvard.
“Our audience is very diverse. It’s a wild hodgepodge of different people that normally wouldn’t sit together under the same rooftop and hopefully end the night being part of a conga line together,” Lauderdale said.
Although Lauderdale does not know the trajectory Pink Martini will take in the coming years, his friends have high hopes.
“I think he should run for President of the United States,” Selvaratnam said.  “We need him.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Matt P. Damon ’92 seemed poised for movie stardom in 1992. While other Harvard students were worrying about getting ready for adulthood, Damon had already appeared in several films and was working on the soon to be award winning script for “Good Will Hunting”.
Damon’s freshman roommate Jason Furman ’92 recalls him fondly.
“The first thing he said to me is that I was really lucky to room with [him],” Furman said. Damon was referring to the fact that he was going to be leaving campus toward the end of the year to appear in a movie, allowing Furman to enjoy the privacy and luxury of a freshman year single.
Furman said that native Cantabrigian Damon was a great friend who showed him a “different side” of Cambridge.
Damon also spent time with his friends from his high school, the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, including actor Ben Affleck. Affleck often visited Furman and Damon’s Matthews Hall room freshman year, the trio doing things they “couldn’t do until [they] were twenty-one.”
Damon studied English, though he dropped out before graduation, while Furman focused on economics. Year later, then-President Obama would appoint Furman Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors. When the two first met, Damon was so intimidated by Furman’s intelligence that he nearly turned around and went home.
The friends’ paths diverged at Harvard, although they remained close. Furman went to Adams and became integrated with leftists and activists. Damon went to Lowell and punched The Delphic final club.
Damon also joined the Harvard theater scene. One of his earlier roles was in musical revue “A...My Name Is Alice”—he had a minor role in the play after the original actor dropped out. Many of the actors in the show—who included China F. Forbes ’92 of Pink Martini and playwright A. Eisa Davis ’92—went on to become well-known in entertainment, film, and music.
Director Jennifer Giering ’92 remembered that Damon as a team player without “a performance ego,” qualities essential for the feminist show where women “shined.”
Damon also appeared alongside Joshua P. Anderson ’93 in a performance of “Burn This”.
“He already had a buzz,” Anderson said of Damon, adding that many of their castmates felt that Damon was well on his way to a successful career in film. “He was incredibly intense. He was not [in the show] to have fun or socialize. He was here to work.”
While in a playwriting class taught by Anthony Kubiak, Damon wrote the first draft of the script that would one day become Good Will Hunting as a final project.
The film’s love interest, Skylar, shares a name with Damon’s girlfriend at the time, Skylar S. Ulrich ’93, née Satenstein. Anderson suspected that the film’s Skylar was inspired by Ulrich, who is now a physician in Northern California. He recalls that Ulrich was “unlike any girl [they] had seen before,” with long blonde hair and a perennial motorcycle jacket.
“Let me tell you, I loved Harvard,” Damon said to the Crimson in 1997. “It was a huge, huge part of my life. I still have time left and I want to go back when I get a chance.”
Although he never managed to finish that English degree, Damon did return to campus to receive the 2013 Harvard Arts Medal.\

In 1992, Harvard students logged in.
The stage had been set for almost a decade. Experimental Internet technologies grew exponentially throughout the 1980s, and in 1985 Bill Gates launched the first edition of Microsoft Windows. A year later, science fiction writer William F. Gibson coined the portmanteau “cyberspace.” In 1991, the World Wide Web debuted, marking the birth of the consumer Internet.
Network technology at Harvard, however, was in place long before the start of the University’s student access network.  In the early 70s, Harvard built a connection to ARPANET—a Defense Department-sponsored network—which connected computers located at universities across the country.
Scott O. Bradner, a former senior technology consultant for the University who helped design its early networks, said that at the time, Harvard’s network infrastructure was limited to connections between the source of Harvard’s ARPANET link—the former Aiken Computer Lab, the Science Center, and William James Hall.  Until 1983, access to ARPANET was strictly restricted to researchers receiving federal funding, Bradner said.
“There was only one connection to it,” Bradner said, “It was small, it was low-bandwidth: 56 kilobits… It was great for email, but not for a great deal of other things.”
In 1986, the National Science Foundation launched the expanded NSFNET to connect researchers to the NSF’s supercomputers. According to Bradner, this prompted the University to begin working on its own internal data connections.
“It was only in ’86 that the infrastructure got put in at the national level to support any kind of reasonable data network, other than the original ARPANET,” Bradner said.
In January 1986, the University linked 13 Faculty of Arts and Sciences buildings with data cables.  This was followed by proposals to connect the entire University to the Internet, which coincided with plans to overhaul the University’s telephone system.
“Starting in ’92, there was a major effort to get fiber to most of the buildings in Boston and Cambridge,” Bradner said. “It was a big project.  It was [about] 95 buildings... It was expensive. OIT [Office of Information Technology] borrowed against the endowment to do it.”
Around the same time, the commercial Internet was expanding, particularly with the 1989 launch of NEARNET —a collaboration between Harvard, MIT, and Boston University—to provide a network for academic, government, and industry use in the greater Boston and New England area.
“A fellow from MIT, a fellow from BU, and I got together and decided that we could do something better: a microwave-based, Boston Basin internet… It was called NEARNET,” Bradner said. “It never had a commercial exclusion. The ARPANET and the NSFNET both had exclusions for commercial traffic."
By the early 90s, NEARNET had more than 200 members in six different states.
But if the internet’s ubiquity might cause most people to overlook its presence today, the relative obscurity of Harvard’s “high speed data network” in 1992 caused some students to disregard its significance at first. Several class of 1992 alumni did not use the Harvard network, or even recall its presence during their time at Harvard.
Eric T. Eads ’92, a former resident of Leverett House, described he and his roommates as being initially amused by the large number of data ports in the rooms.
“We thought it was so funny… we didn’t know what to do with them,” Eads said with a laugh.
Mark W. Jacobstein ’92, who was a computer science concentrator, said that while he “vaguely” recalled discussions about connecting the University, he did not start using the Internet until after he graduated.
“In 1992, not everyone even had a computer,” Jacobstein said, “I don’t know that we would have known what to do with a network… Your friends didn’t have email addresses at other colleges, it just wasn’t part of the milieu.”
C. Eric Rosenblum ’92 and N. Edwin Aoki ’92, fellow students studying computer science, also noted that they did not use the Internet or the network during their time at Harvard.
Bradner remarked that “it took a number of years” after 1992 to fully expand internet access to all of the dorms. And while not all in the class of 1992 had the chance to use the Internet at Harvard, future students certainly did.
A 1993 op-ed written by Crimson editor Haibin B. Jiu ’94 noted an “explosive growth” in network users, remarking that over 68 percent of the class of 1997 had registered for email accounts with the University.
Indeed, much of the traffic in early years of the network was driven by students transferring pirated music.
“When the ethernet got rolled out, there was certainly a lot a popularity. Unfortunately, a lot of that was for music sharing. And Harvard, like any higher-ed institution, has had its troubles with the RIAA complaining that students are stealing music,” Bradner said with a chuckle.
The rise in the popularity of network services at Harvard paralleled the Internet’s swift global rise. By 1993, there were over 14 million internet users and 130 websites worldwide.
At Harvard, a 1995 faculty committee called for every staff and faculty member to have access to a computer and the Internet by summer of the next year.
Among the administrative figures in the effort to expand internet access at Harvard were former Dean of the Division of Applied Sciences Paul C. Martin ’51 and then-Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68.
Bradner said that Lewis, who also served as faculty advisor to the athletic department, insisted that the athletic buildings be included as part of the internet roll-out around campus.
“It’s a little hard to imagine the Harvard campus without internet and email—and that of course even that was before mobile phones,” Lewis said. “The crew [team] used to post their rowing schedules in the window of Leavitt and Pierce. Rowers used to get up in the morning and go look in the window to see what times they were out.”
Around 2000, Harvard’s network bandwidth tripled from 45 to 115 megabits per second, in response to high user demand. WiFi, which the University introduced on campus in 2001, was extended to the houses and dorms in 2004.
Nonetheless, there still appears to be room for growth.  Current undergraduates often gripe about the intermittent WiFi quality around campus, sometimes airing their frustration through memes in Facebook groups.
“There have been dead-spots all over the place,” Mounir M. Jamal ’17 said.  “If you were in my bedroom, the WiFi’s OK, and then if you go to the bathroom, it’s nonexistent.”
“I wouldn’t really count on it in the Quad Yard,” Jamal, who is a Pforzheimer resident, added.
Last week, CS50 course instructor David J. Malan ’99 enlisted the help of CS concentrators and other undergraduates to help the University identify WiFi dead-spots.  In an email, Malan asked students to enter the location of WiFi issues in a Google Form.
When asked if he would be submitting complaints via Malan’s form, Jamal replied in the affirmative.
“Yes, yes, yes,” Jamal said with a laugh.

When Leonard Jeffries came to Harvard in February of 1992 to speak as a guest of the Black Students Association, the campus reverberated with dissent.
Jeffries, who was then a professor at the City University of New York, had been criticized for his controversial remarks perceived as offensive by members of the Jewish, Italian-American, and BGLTQ communities, among others. Students from on-campus groups such as Harvard Hillel, the Harvard College Democrats, and the Catholic Students Association, to name a few, expressed their discontent by planning to hold a rally in front of Emerson Hall during the speech.
University officials decided to move the event to Sanders Theatre in order to resolve the commotion Jeffries would bring with him to campus.
The BSA defended their selection of Jeffries among the range of speakers invited to campus to “explore diverse points of view,” according to then-BSA Vice President Zaheer A. Ali ’94.
“The topic of Afrocentrism, multiculturalism, and diversity in the curriculum was very much a topic at the forefront of people thinking about and people talking about history and education,” Ali said. “Leonard Jeffries had emerged as one of the most vocal proponents of Afrocentrism and that kind of branch of study.”
Leaders of other student minority groups, such as Asian American Association Vice President Darshak A. Sanghavi ’92, saw little value in inviting Jeffries.
“Rather than promoting racial understanding and harmony, he was much more divisive, sort of a demagogue,” Sanghavi said.
Reports of racial profiling of black students circulated campus.  On April 9, 1992, Clinton E. Dye III ’93 was stopped en route to his home in Leverett House when police received reports of stolen bicycles from the Quad. On April 12, Luis R. Rodriguez ’94 and Raymond Joseph Jr. ’94 were stopped when rapping in the Yard near Hollis. On April 13, Stacey R. Carter ’93 said she and a friend were ignored by University police while being sexually harassed in front of Claverly Hall.
According to Ali, black students—especially black men—were often asked to show ID upon entering campus-owned buildings “with the assumption being that if you were black and, in particular, if you were a black male, that you didn’t belong on campus until you could prove you were a student.”
The cases came alongside national protest following the beating of Rodney King by four white police officers in March 1991.
In response, the BSA wrote a flyer entitled “On the Harvard Plantation” and hand-delivered it to the doors of campus dorms and offices. The flyer compiled four instances of police profiling that black students faced across the University, according to Ali.
“This had a really profound impact: to wake up the next day, essentially, or come into the office the next day, and find this flyer detailing the point of grievance that black students had, not just in the College, but we also included concerns of members of the Black Law Students Association and the W.E.B. Du Bois Graduate Society,” Ali said.
Then-Harvard Police Chief Paul E. Johnson called the flyer’s statements “errors of fact.”
Natosha Reid ’93 called the flyer a method of starting a “back and forth” on profiling.
“We needed to have meetings and conversations where they would understand our perspective, but also so that we could talk more about safe policing and policing communities,” she said.
According to Ali, the flyer resulted in a meeting with then=University President Neil L. Rudenstine, who was very “proactive, as were the deans at the time.”
Reid said the flyer was a “wake up call” to the Harvard administration and student body, and a move to claim visibility.
“On the Harvard Plantation” was not the only flyer that caused controversy at Harvard in 1992.
Conservative campus journal Peninsula circulated a controversial flyer in mid-April around Cabot and Mather Houses advertising a symposium entitled “Spade Kicks: A Symposium on Modernity and the Negro as a Paradigm of Sexual Liberation.” The symposium featured Fidelity magazine founder E. Michael Jones and Chicago social worker Gloria G. Hardy.
The image depicted a black woman performing a striptease for a white man while a black saxophonist played in the background. Peninsula editor Matthew J. McDonald ’92 said the flyer was the subject of “a firestorm that erupted” on campus.
More than 40 black students, many of whom were part of the BSA, walked out of the April 22 symposium in Sever Hall. Although Ali was not part of the walk-out, he was involved in protest against the flyer.
“There’s not a worse example of racism from their own perspective. It was kind of a racial provocation,” he said.
McDonald said the flyer was “deliberately provocative” and that “the poster lent itself to being misinterpreted.” However, he said the content of the symposium was not racist but “sympathetic to the African American community.”
McDonald said that Peninsula “did not foresee” the reaction from the student body and the publication published an op-ed in the Crimson expressing regret for the poster, signed by Christian G. Vergonis ’92, who was on the council of Peninsula.
Sanghavi said that Peninsula’s usage of the poster was a continuation of the way the publication “took pride in being inflammatory.”
“We shouldn’t have to see this,” Ali said. “We shouldn’t have to be faced with people using this kind of language or imagery to depict black people in a demeaning kind of way.”
Students reached out to University administration and met with the University President, representatives of the Harvard Corporation, and various deans.
As co-chair of the Harvard Foundation Student Advisory Committee, Reid was involved in promoting discussion of minority issues at the College. She and S. Allen Counter, the director of the Foundation, wrote a letter to The Crimson identifying bias in its representation of minority voices.
“That was a plea for the importance of including diversity—ethnic diversity, religious diversity—in conversations and providing power, for lack of a word, to all of these groups to have access to the opportunity to participate, engage, and set tone for the community of Harvard,” Reid said.
The letter set off a back and forth between The Crimson, the Foundation, and minority student groups on campus about representation. The conversation illuminated tensions between student groups on campus, each of whom had different approaches to asserting their place at Harvard and representing minority communities on campus.
Then-University President Neil L. Rudenstine made an effort to meet with minority groups on campus who were engaged in the controversial events surrounding race.
In May 1992, Rudenstine organized a race relations summit where he invited leaders of black and Jewish student groups to suggest proposals for improving minority representation on campus. Reid attended the summit with Shai A. Held ’94, the President of Harvard Hillel and a member of the Harvard Foundation.
Reid and Held spoke specifically about the controversy surrounding the invitation of Jeffries. According to Reid, those conversations were “constructive and substantive conversations on areas in which we disagreed.”
The College also created working groups for minority students and coordinated house meetings to discuss riots in Los Angeles as well as other racial issues across the nation.
“We were having courageous conversations at a time when generations before us could not even have conversations,” Reid said.
“Having been an administrator from ’68 to ’91, compared to some of the earlier eras, the ’90s were remarkably harmonious,” Rudenstine said. “Which is not to say there weren’t issues. But compared to the early things I witnessed and was part of, the ’90s were really a time [when people displayed relative capacity to] come together and solve problems rather than create them.”

“He’s in the crowd, but you can’t pick him out,” a 1991 article in the Crimson said of Harvard’s newly-elected President Neil L. Rudenstine. “He doesn’t look like a Harvard president.”
Following a turbulent year-long search, Rudenstine took the helm as Harvard’s 26th president in September 1991. Yet some Harvard affiliates had doubts: The successor of notoriously charismatic President Derek C. Bok, Rudenstine was considered a little too mild.
“He definitely did not seem as strong a personality as President Bok,” Evan B. Rauch ’91, former Undergraduate Council Chair, said. “Derek Bok really felt like he could be a US Senator… [Rudenstine] seemed more of a mild-mannered person who would maybe be the Chief of Staff of a US Senator.”
Rudenstine acknowledged comparisons to Bok. “I don’t for a moment doubt that Derek Bok and Larry [Summers] were both charismatic and marvelous leaders. It’s obviously a nice thing if you can have it,” he said with a laugh.
By the end of Rudenstine’s first year, however, Harvard was singing a different tune. A June 1992 article in The Crimson named Rudenstine a “down-to-earth populist,” and students seemed to agree.
“He was very patient and a really nice guy,” Serena Y. Volpp ’92, a childhood friend of Rudenstine’s daughter, said. Volpp remembered Rudenstine taking her and a group of six girls into New York to go shopping on Canal Street.
Rudenstine’s “populism” would serve him well: In his first year as President, he would tackle a record-setting University-wide capital campaign, cooperative inter-school initiatives, and growing racial tensions among students and faculty. When he retired 10 years later, he left the University more cohesive than he had found it.
When asked about the ideal relationship between Harvard’s many schools, Rudenstine’s contemporaries turned to a common idiom: “Every tub on its own bottom.” Coined by John Bunyan in 1678 but applied to Harvard by President John T. Kirkland in the early 19th century, the phrase asserts that each school must maintain financial and administrative independence.
Rudenstine took a more collaborative approach. “The hope was we could get different units to collaborate on the same kinds of projects,” he said. “Some [faculties] were doing very similar work on certain problems, sometimes even without knowing it.”
Indeed, Rudenstine entered his presidency with two primary goals: to bring the University closer together, and to run a successful capital campaign.
He was well-equipped for the job. From 1968 to 1988, Rudenstine had assumed almost every major administrative position at Princeton, managing a $410 million fund drive among other duties. From 1988 to 1991, he served as executive vice president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.
“I cannot think of a candidate so well-endowed with the knowledge, experience, temperament, and character needed to serve as Harvard’s president,” Bok said when Rudenstine’s selection was announced.
Rudenstine stated his goals of the capital campaign and inter-school cooperation early on.
Unlike early Harvard campaigns, which had mostly focused on individual schools, he planned something “totally different”: the first university-wide campaign.
“Let’s retain the strength and vitality and the healthy entrepreneurship of the separate schools,”
Rudenstine said in an interview shortly after his presidency was announced. “But let’s find some overarching structures... that actually make it possible for them to intercommunicate, to help one another.”
Rudenstine fielded doubts from “every tub on its own bottom” traditionalists. “The opposite of a decentralized system is not a highly centralized system,” he said. “The alternative is kind of a woven fabric, a collaborative enterprise.”
Granted, his presidency got off to a slow start: The capital campaign, originally scheduled to begin in the fall of 1991, was delayed until 1994.
Rudenstine attributed the delay to strategy. “Before I would think about fundraising, I would guess you’d want to think about what you need the funds for. You develop priorities and then you go find the money,” Rudenstine said after the capital campaign delay was announced.
“Not everything happens in the first year,” Rudenstine reflected in a recent interview, 25 years later. “You don’t have all the ideas you’re ever going to have in the first year.”
In the meantime, Rudenstine set himself to immediate concerns. He filled four open deanships and a general counsel position, and re-established the position of Provost—previously unoccupied since World War II. He also attempted to address simmering racial tensions on campus.
“There were a lot of different kinds of events and incidents that happened during that school year... things that other student groups had done that were racially provocative,” Zaheer Ali ’94, president of the Black Student Association in 1992, said.
After incidents such as publishing of racially derogatory stereotypes in the campus publication  Peninsula, Ali and the Black Student Association penned and distributed a flyer they titled “On the Harvard Plantation” detailing their concerns.
After they had distributed the flyer, Ali was “surprised and actually impressed” when he received a call from President Rudenstine’s office that asked to meet with him. Later, Rudenstine convened a series of meetings that centered around issues such as hate speech and police sensitivity.
“I think his very swift leadership in that way signaled to the deans of the college and of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences that they too should take our concerns seriously,” Ali said. “He mobilized the various offices and departments and deanships around particular issues and gave the students an opportunity to speak to those issues.”
Rudenstine spent much of his first year in this way, “getting reacquainted with people,” as  Daniel H. Tabak ’92 put it. “He was the provost of Princeton so he hadn’t been at Harvard for a while before he came.”
In contrast to Bok, who students criticized as being unapproachable, Rudenstine held open office hours and even a first-year dance.
“We felt this great affection for President Rudenstine,” Oriana L. Harvey ’92 said. “When we referred to him, we always referred to him as Rudy.”
By the time he left Harvard, Rudenstine had by most standards achieved his major goals.
He made strides toward inter-school unity, developing interdisciplinary programs including the Mind, Brain and Behavior Interfaculty Initiative, the University Committee on the Environment, and the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies.
His capital campaign raised $2.6 billion dollars—far more than his stated goal of $2.1 billion.  “You never make enough to be fully satisfied, but yes, I think the University moved in that direction,” Albert Carnesale, selected by Rudenstine to be Dean of the Harvard Kennedy School and later Provost of the University, reflected.
Harvey remembered Rudenstine’s capital campaign as “very successful,” both in immediate fundraising and influencing future generations of donors. “I think it also probably implanted this little seed in our heads… that later on after we graduate we should, to the extent of our abilities, contribute and give to our alma mater,” she said.
More broadly, Rudenstine’s innovative university-wide campaign catalyzed a new era of inter-school cooperation at Harvard. His legacy is subtle but enduring: traces remain in Drew G. Faust’s contemporary “One Harvard” capital campaign.
When asked about the legacy he leaves behind, Rudenstine is as placid as ever. “No, I think I’ll leave it to others,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twenty five years ago, the definition of sexual assault became a center of debate on Harvard’s campus. The controversy arose from comments on sexual assault from former Dean of the College L. Fred Jewett ’57, which set off a firestorm of protests.
“When people are drunk, they may not remember whether they said yes or not,” Jewett said in 1990, explaining that substance abuse often plays a case in sexual assault cases. “The person that’s drunk is not always clear, is not articulate, and that’s why you get these cases.”
Criticizing the dean for his perceived insensitivity to sexual assault victims, students marched and launched an “Attack Jewett” campaign. In response, Jewett set up a Date Rape Task Force that included students and faculty, charging it with the creation of a set of recommendations for the College regarding sexual assault policies.
Appointed in 1990, the Date Rape Task Force’s efforts culminated two years later with the release of a report advocating for structural changes in the Administrative Board’s handling of rape cases and a radical redefinition of what constituted rape.
“Rape includes any act of sexual intercourse that occurs without the expressed consent of the person, or is accompanied by physical force or threat of bodily injury,” according to the report. “Lack of consent may be indicated physically or verbally and needs only to be expressed once.”
The need for “expressed consent” became a center of debate, especially after the Undergraduate Council put out its own report in response to the Task Force’s report. The UC offered a much narrower definition of sexual assault, requiring “expressed unwillingness” on the part of the victim instead.
Naomi M. Hamburg ’92, an undergraduate member of the Task Force, disagreed with the UC’s proposed definition, which would have put the burden of objecting to sexual advances on the victim.
“To me, the fundamental message of having expressed consent is that people are going to be engaging in consensual sexual activity, and that's the way people should treat each other. And that's the message that the University should give to its students,” Hamburg said.
Many student groups, including the Civil Liberties Union of Harvard and the conservative magazine The Harvard Salient, however, claimed that “expressed consent” would result in students wrongly accusing other students—primarily men—of rape. One of the most commonly cited scenarios was that of the case in which two students had sex while intoxicated, but one or both partners had failed to provide explicit consent.
According to an op-ed published in The Crimson by Law School student Hans F. Bader in 1992, “A man can be found guilty of rape for sexual activity initiated by his partner, while a woman can perform sexual acts on a profoundly intoxicated, incapacitated male without being charged even with sexual assault.”
Tensions increased as other students added their voices to the ongoing conversation. At one point, the Harvard Political Union sponsored a panel featuring many of those involved in the campus debate, including Hamburg and Malcolm A. Heinicke ’93, the UC chair responsible for authoring the council’s definition.
A year after the report’s release, the Faculty Council adopted a definition that required sexual assault victims to “express unwillingness.” Jewett commented at the time that he was “pleased” with the result, as the policy was “quite explicit and firm.”
Over two decades after the Faculty Council voted for the UC’s definition and the Administrative Board rejected many of the Task Force’s recommendations, Harvard restructured its sexual harassment policies again.
In 2014, the University created its current Title IX policy, which defines sexual harassment as “unwelcome conduct of sexual nature.” This standard has prompted outcry among activists, and the committee currently responsible with reviewing Harvard’s policy has looked into adopting a definition that uses affirmative consent instead.
Hamburg said that she found the controversy over affirmative consent today “surprising.”
“From a human interaction aspect, it seems like this is about the right way to treat each other,” she said.
However, the affirmative consent standard, which numerous other universities, including Yale University and the University of California system, have adopted, has drawn criticism. Harvard Law School graduates Justin Dillon and Hanna L. Stotland ’99 published an op-ed in The Crimson this year calling the adoption of such policies “a grave mistake,” given the potential for wrongful convictions in ambiguous cases.
Although the issue of affirmative consent policies continues to be a source of debate, Joshua E. Burstein ’93, former co-director of the Civil Liberties Union of Harvard, said he believes the overall conversation surrounding sexual assault has improved in recent years.
“I think overall we as a society have gotten so much farther than I ever could’ve hoped for on what’s appropriate, particularly in the sexual realm, and what’s not accepted,” Burstein said. “I think that more men in particular are getting it these days than in the early ’90s."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the fall of 1991, a group of undergraduate women formed an all-female social club they called the Bee. Though Harvard had had all-male final clubs for over a century, the Bee was the first final club for women. The campus was set abuzz.
Like the male final clubs, the up-and-coming organization would be best known for its silence. According to a December 1991 article published in The Crimson, alleged members of The Bee declined to comment, often responding to interview requests identically with: “I’m sorry. I cannot help you with your story.”
Criticism filled the silence. In December 1991, then-Radcliffe Union of Students President Kate Frucher ’92 compared the Bee to all-male final clubs.
“It does a disservice to the women’s community here,” Frucher said at the time. “We should try things that aren’t exclusive.”
Yet the few Bee members willing to speak to the press insisted that it was a supportive and “empowering” space for women. “For me, it wasn’t about competing with the final clubs or replicating them,” Amy Salzhauer ’91, a trustee of the Bee, said in a recent interview. “It was more about making our own community for people who identify as women.”
The club was formed during a hostile time for single-gender social organizations.
The relationship between the clubs and the University had been tense since at least 1984, when administrators issued an ultimatum: go co-ed or go private. The all-male final clubs and fraternities chose the latter but remained a prominent element of Harvard’s social fabric, drawing the ire of administrators.
“Fraternities are illegal at Harvard,” Epps said in 1991. “We have very great doubts about the efficacy of fraternities because many have the reputation for the abuse of alcohol and for interference with academic work.”
Though the Bee was a novelty, administrators adhered to precedent: Then-Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III said in December 1991 that the Bee could not be recognized by the University.
Historically, all-female social spaces at Harvard and Radcliffe had struggled to get off the ground.
In the spring of 1990, students from the Radcliffe Union of Students called for the creation of a women’s center, gathering over 1,000 signatures to urge then-Radcliffe President Laura S. Wilson to consider the measure. However, such a building was never created.
Proposed sororities had neither the resources of established final clubs nor the support of national organizations. In November 1991, the National Panhellenic Conference withdrew from a planned Harvard sorority after learning about the College’s policies on fraternities and sororities.
Even the Athena Club, an inclusive all-female club founded in March 1990, was short-lived—it fizzled out within a few years of its creation.
Bereft, former Athena Club members formed the Bee, named after a “sewing bee” formed by Cambridge women during the Civil War. The club succeeded where others had failed.
Despite Harvard’s single-gender social organization policy, some members felt supported by the Radcliffe administration, particularly then-Dean Phillippa A. Bovet.
“It was a very easy founding, I think, for the women on campus,” Salzhauer, who was also a founder of the Athena Club, said. “We really did have the support of the administration and the support of so many students and… existing organizations.”
Salzhauer said that she did not hear negative reactions during her involvement in the Athena Club and the Bee. Overall, she said she found the experience “positive,” “happy,” and “very empowering.”
Although the Bee has never owned its own building, members of the club found space. In its first year, the Bee held social events by renting the Harvard Advocate’s building in 21 South St. as well as The Crimson’s property at 14 Plympton St.
Eventually, the Bee started leasing the Fly Club’s location at 45 Dunster St., where it remains today.
Since the Bee was founded in 1991, four other all-female organizations have emerged. The IC Club, formerly known as the Isis Club, was founded in 2000. Pleiades and the Sab Club, formerly known as the Sablière Society, were founded in 2002. The newest addition to all-female final clubs, La Vie, emerged in 2008.
Sororities have also grown to play an important role in campus social life, as seen by the record-breaking 286 women who rushed Harvard’s four sororities in 2017.
“The formation of the Bee served as a model for other clubs to follow,” J. Suzanne Mosher ’91 said “The premise was to provide women with the same opportunity to come together in a welcome space where individuals can be heard and find a pathway to leadership.”
In the spring of 2016, the University announced sweeping sanctions barring undergraduate members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations from holding athletic team captaincies and leadership positions in all recognized student groups and making them ineligible for College endorsement for prestigious awards such as the Rhodes scholarship.
Regardless of current sanctions, some club members are proud to have set the precedent of  all-female social spaces on Harvard’s campus.
“The legacy of having a space that was controlled by the women, to me, is a really proud legacy,” Salzhauer said.

As a freshman, Richard E. Hyland ’69 was not particularly attuned to Cold War politics. While students at the College protested the United States’s campaign in Vietnam, Hyland did not identify with the anti-war movement.
One day, though, Hyland found a small leaflet slipped under the door of his freshman suite.
“The leaflet said ‘If you’re for the war in Vietnam, why aren’t you fighting it, and if you’re against the war in Vietnam, why aren’t you in the streets fighting against it with us?’” Hyland said.
Inspired by the leaflet, Hyland rushed to the periodical reading room in Lamont and began to study Vietnam. Soon, Hyland knew he wanted to join the anti-war movement at Harvard.
In the late 1960s, students, professors, and administrators were sharply divided over the war. Anti-war student activists clashed with politicians and University administrators as the nation grappled with one of the most brutal—and controversial—wars in the country’s history.
In 1966, Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara was invited to Harvard to be made the first Honorary Associate of the Kennedy Institute in an event organized by Barney Frank ’61-’62. The ceremony brought the controversial McNamara to Cambridge to deliver remarks to a preselected group of 120 students.
When the Students for a Democratic Society, a collective of College anti-war activists, heard about McNamara’s impending visit, the organization challenged him to a debate with Vietnam War critic and journalist Robert Scheer.
“We took the position that if McNamara was going to come to Harvard, which was fine, he needed to debate the war. He couldn’t just come and get a free pass and go unchallenged,” said SDS leader Michael S. Ansara ’68. “We didn’t dispute his right to give a speech…but we said that the university has to be a source of free exchange of ideas and debate.”
McNamara rejected the group’s invitation to debate, prompting SDS to organize a protest against the Secretary in the Quincy House courtyard. When McNamara attempted to leave campus after giving a talk to the preselected 120 students, he was mobbed by hundreds of student demonstrators and prevented from leaving the premises. The crowd forced McNamara to abandon his car and climb onto the hood, where he agreed to take only three questions from the demonstrators.
After McNamara said that he could not say how many civilians had been killed in Vietnam, Ansara challenged him. “I said ‘You can’t because you don’t know or because you don’t care?’ at which point McNamara completely lost it.”
At this point, Ansara recalled, McNamara became belligerent, putting his finger on Ansara’s chest and raising his voice. “He started shrieking ‘I was tougher then and I’m tougher now.’”
Ansara was stunned by McNamara’s reaction.
“I couldn’t believe it. Here is the Secretary of Defense, in charge of this war, just completely losing it and saying that he’s tougher than we are, I think my jaw dropped to be honest with you,” he said.
The confrontation ended when the police arrived to whisk McNamara away.
Despite the presence of College students at the protest, other students were shocked by the event. Over 2700 College students signed a letter of apology to McNamara, and the protest was ridiculed by The Crimson’s editorial board.
“We were right about the war… we understood that we would provoke a reaction and that it would give us a chance for discussion and debate,” Ansara said. “You’re not going to get a debate by being polite.”
SDS was not the only group of activists protesting against the war. Another student group named The Resistance was specifically dedicated to opposing the draft and the use of draft cards.
In 1967, The Resistance member Michael K. Ferber ’69, along with several others living in Boston and Cambridge, was charged with conspiracy to aid, abet, and council draft deferment after bringing a bag of draft cards to Washington as a protest. Although he was convicted, the case was later thrown out on appeal.
Although Ferber later dropped out during the trial, he recalled that Harvard students took notice. “I was briefly a hero on campus, as the one Harvard person and draft resister in the group. People would come up to me on campus, including some faculty and some who disagreed with me…I sensed a good deal of support and respect from just about everybody I dealt with,” Ferber said.
Similarly, in an act of protest against the mandatory draft, David A. Reed ’68 burned his draft card and refused to report for duty in March 1966. Reed, who was on a leave of absence at the time, staged a sit-down during his sentencing and had to be forcibly removed from the courtroom. He was sentenced to three years in federal prison for burning his draft card.
Like the divided student opinion, Harvard faculty and administrators also found themselves on both sides of the heated debate.
Charles S. Maier ’60, then a history instructor at the College, said the division between students and faculty was not as black and white as some have argued it was.
“There were great divisions in the faculty… The lines were not clearly professorial-student lines, they were intra-faculty cleavages as well,” Maier said.
According to Maier and Ansara, there were certainly a handful of professors who were openly supportive of the anti-Vietnam War demonstrations on campus, such as History professor Franklin L. Ford ’48. In another case, 50 professors signed a letter authored by the SDS in support of the McNamara-Scheer debate.
Still, displays of faculty support of anti-war student activism was, according to Hyland, an aberration from the norm.
“Intellectual dialogue broke down in an amazing and demonstrative way. They were unable to bridge the gap and understand that the world was changing…There was just a complete absence of any kind of communication,” Hyland said.
Ansara echoed this assessment, adding that he thought the faculty contributed to the lack of mutual understanding.
“Pusey had no idea what we were talking about or what issues the students were struggling with. [The administration] thought that everybody should be happy to be at Harvard to be groomed to be part of the elite,” he said.
Despite student and faculty activism against the war, the war went on. As the violence from the conflict reached a head in the following two years—1968 and 1969—tensions between anti-war activists and the rest of Harvard only became more entrenched.
According to Dean of Freshman Thomas A. Dingman ‘67, a student at the College during the war, the class of 1967 was “on the cusp” of being politically active.
“We were not a class that was very politically active...things changed rather dramatically in a year’s time, a number of campuses experienced students being involved in protests for very worthy causes, but we were a fairly tame class,” he said.
Yet the protests that roiled Harvard’s campus during the 1960s form only a chapter in a broader national history of Vietnam War opposition at American universities. In the final years of the 1960s and the early 1970s, protests famously erupted at Kent State University, the University of Washington, Columbia, the University of Maryland, and the New York University.
Anti-war protests were also not bound to university campuses. Large demonstrations took hold in places like Los Angeles, Chicago, and San Francisco, and a particularly famous demonstration took place at President Richard Nixon’s inauguration in 1969.
Ansara believes the uniqueness of Harvard’s protests was merely perceived.
“Everybody thought that because it happened at Harvard it was so unique and special. The only thing that made it unique was that it got more attention than it deserved. What happened at Harvard happened at 1,200 other colleges and universities in pretty much the same way,” he said.
Although the protests were going on at Harvard, Ansara added, it did not mean they were particularly special.
“Harvard loves to believe that it’s totally unique but in this case it was only one of the thousands of universities going through this experience in those years,” he said.

In the mid to late 1960s, race-fueled riots swept the country.
In cities like Detroit, Harlem, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles, daily routines ground to a halt as protesters took to streets and violence erupted amongst residents frustrated by the discrimination and poverty that plagued cities.
Despite the backdrop of tumultuous race relations, all was quiet in a section of Boston’s Roxbury neighborhood, which was similarly as poor and racially segregated as the cities where riots did take hold.
In 1965, Massachusetts State Representative Frank Holgate said that there was potential in many places for riots, but that he found it unlikely that violence would materialize in Roxbury, adding he found living conditions there to be better than in other cities where riots had taken place.
That same year, John Mendelhof an organizer with activist group Dudley Street Action Center said that instead of riots in Boston, he expected to see increased urban gang warfare.
Noel Day, head of Massachusetts Freedom Movement, another activist group, said in 1965 that cities like Indianapolis and Gary were closer to experiencing race-based violence than Boston. However, he said, "riots are inevitable as long as remedies are approached in a less than complete way."
On June 2, 1967, that pattern ended.
A peaceful sit-in organized by Mothers for Adequate Welfare devolved into violent clashes between the police and demonstrators, ending months of peace in the previously quiet neighborhood.
A small handful of Harvard students were there to watch a crucial moment in Boston history unfold.
The MAW sit-in at the Welfare Administration Building in Roxbury aimed to protest inequalities in welfare benefit distribution and demand a response from the government to rectify the issue. When police arrived at the scene, they stormed the building where the sit-in was taking place and began to beat and arrest protesters—including students and mothers.
The violent police response prompted rock and bottle-throwing. As violence further escalated, individuals began to throw Molotov cocktails and loot buildings.
Massachusetts State Representative Byron D. Rushing ’64, a student at the riot, recalled that before violence broke out at the protest, there were many local residents at the building supporting the protesting women.
“The general feeling in the community was that they needed to maintain support for the mothers and that people perceived that the demonstration was going to be drawn out,” Rushing said.
Among those supporters were half a dozen Harvard students who were members of the school’s Students for a Democratic Society chapter. John M. Mendeloff ’68 was one such student.
“By that time, a fairly sizeable crowd gathered outside the building, and when the police started carrying people out, people in the crowd got quite upset, and I became no longer an observer,” Mendeloff said. “We were all taken to jail for the next several hours.”
Since he had been in custody during the bulk of the violence, Mendeloff didn’t find out until later that the confrontation had escalated into a full-scale riot. Rushing, on the other hand, though also arrested and taken to jail, was able to return and attempted to mediate the continuing conflict by speaking with police chased rioters down the streets of Roxbury.
Rushing said that the brutal police response shocked Roxbury’s black residents and contributed to a delayed response to the violence.
“They were surprised by it,” Rushing said. “It took a while for the black leadership and the people to get a sense of how angry black people were in Roxbury at the time, and this was the event that allowed them to express that anger.”
Immediately following the riots, anger was rife in Roxbury, Rushing said. The city, which was at the time transitioning between the mayorship of John F. Collins and Kevin White, did not attempt to strike a reconciliatory tone with the demonstrators, according to Rushing.
“There was no attempt, no symbolic ‘let’s calm everyone down’ thing,” Rushing said. “Kevin White had no clue about the black community in Boston, so he had no staff people who might say, ‘It might be a good thing if you appeared a day or two later and said sorry that this happened.’”
For some, the lack of government response foreclosed the possibility for justice.
“There was a feeling that any of the discussion that had gone on up until there about working together with black people just dissolved,” Rushing said.
The riot had a chilling effect on further race-related demonstrations. After Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated in 1968, instead of reacting violently as many did across the country, the black Boston residents decided not riot and instead recentered organizing efforts around ending residential segregation and promoting economic development.
“There was violence after the announcement of Martin Luther King’s assassination, but there was a general feeling among the young people that it wasn't worth it, that they had to find a new way to express their anger,” Rushing said. “There was a lot of movement to increase the areas in Boston in which black people would be allowed to live.”
In addition to these efforts, organizations like Youth Alliance were established to deal with various community issues and needs. Youth Alliance’s headquarters were on Blue Hills Ave., the same street as the welfare office where the riots began. At first, its members worked as nightly neighborhood patrols to remove the need for city police in the community.
As the organization grew, it began to provide educational opportunities for black youth in the community, particularly those who had dropped out of schools for various reasons, including a the failure of the school system to cater to students from non-white backgrounds.
Despite the prominence of these events in Boston’s history, most Harvard students at the time were more preoccupied with the Vietnam War and draft resistance than the Roxbury race riot.
“I think the proper picture is that there were some Harvard people involved and in some ways helped
establish the group, but by the time the demonstration happened, the group was led by other people who were working more full time and students were more of an ancillary role,” Mendeloff said.

Of all the undergraduate Houses, Mather House is perhaps the most distinctive. Big, bold, and Brutalist, its signature nineteen-story monolith towers over the Charles from the corner of Cowperthwaite and Banks. Below, the Mather low-rise, squat and mechanical, encircles a quadrangle with trees and benches.
To many, Mather is known for its blocky appearance; some students even call it “the box that Dunster came in.” Mather does not immediately evoke the images of a classic Harvard that Eliot or Adams might. Instead, Mather points to a different Harvard era: the 1960s.
The decade was witness to a sharp overcrowding crisis among Harvard’s undergraduate Houses. The crisis reached a peak in the late 1960s, exacerbated by increased enrollment and an unwillingness of students to take leaves of absence, which would make them draft-eligible for the Vietnam War.
Harvard’s plan for the construction of Mather House was in many regards ambitious, but the project was plagued by delays and budgetary constraints.
Harvard hired architect Jean Paul Carlhian of Shepley Bulfinch Richardson and Abbot, the architecture firm that designed the other River Houses, as the chief designer of the tenth House.
The official cost estimate for construction was $8 million, but as construction progressed, University officials began to avoid talking about the figure and instead proposed cost-cutting measures such as replacing brick sidewalks with cement ones.
“The costs were much higher than we had anticipated,” Pusey admitted in a 1967 interview.
Mather Faculty Dean Michael D. Rosengarten—who will depart Mather in June along with his wife and co-Faculty Dean Christie McDonald—said financial constraints eventually prevented the fulfillment of Carlhian’s original plans.
“There was supposed to be terracotta tiles on the outside and they shortchanged us one elevator, so right near the entrance as you walk in on the left side, there’s an empty elevator shaft,” he said.
Additionally, according to McDonald, Carlhian planned for artwork to line Mather’s interior walls.
“Jean Paul Carlhian was determined at the time that there be art everywhere in Mather. Only his idea was that it would be art from the Fogg Museum and he wasn’t thinking about any kind of security problem,” she said.
Besides the tiles and the elevator, budget trimming also ended up doing away with soundproofing, carpeting, and closet doors.
Construction began in the late summer of 1966, but financial issues delayed Mather’s opening an entire year, from the originally projected Sept. of 1969 to the fall of 1970.
Predating the construction of the Science Center in 1972 and Canaday Hall in 1974, Mather was Harvard’s first truly modernist building. Despite the various amenities the new building offered, student reactions to Mather often ranged from apathetic to mixed.
Former Mather resident C. Douglas Payne ’71 said he didn’t think Mather’s architecture prompted much discussion when the building was being developed.
“I don’t think it was a topic of much conversation. We were more worried about the Vietnam War,” he said. “Back then, people were into modern things. It was the tail-end of mid-century of modernism so people generally thought it was a cool looking building.”
Other students, however, said they were decidedly unsatisfied with Mather’s architecture.
Martin H. Kaplan ’71, a former Dunster resident and Crimson editor, wrote in an op-ed at the time that he believed “Mather House almost demands that we abandon our way of seeing.”
“Mather House is the future. Stone cold, fluorescent, angular, it juts into our eyes like a stiletto from the next century,” Kaplan wrote.
Despite some shortcomings, Mather succeeded in alleviating the overcrowding crisis in the undergraduate Houses, Payne said.
“In Lowell House, we had four guys in a suite originally designed for two. One year I slept in the closet. My bed just fit into the closet. The next year, we had two bathrooms, so I turned one of the bathrooms into my bedroom,” Payne said. “I think in Mather we all had our separate bedrooms.”
The new space Mather provided allowed the College to lower the number of students permitted to live off-campus. Mather also gave Harvard the space necessary to temporarily halt its practice of turning doubles into triples and triples into quads to squeeze in more students.
The availability of guaranteed singles remains one of Mather’s biggest selling points today, and McDonald said that singles made a similar, radical impact back then.
“It was conceived as a modern house for a modern student, which was different from the way the conception of student life was in the 1930s. So the idea that every student would have a single was remarkable,” she said.
Despite being one of Harvard’s newest undergraduate Houses, Mather’s history goes back earlier to its namesake, Increase Mather, class of 1656.
Increase was a Puritanical minister and the first President of Harvard to be born in North America. He was first suggested as a possible namesake for what became Leverett House in 1930, but the Harvard Corporation shut down the idea.
Although he was heavily influential in securing charters for the Massachusetts Bay Colony and for Harvard, the decision to name the House after Increase was controversial: His son, Cotton Mather, was involved in the Salem Witch Trials, and Increase owned a number of slaves.
Earlier this year, the House unveiled an exhibit that delved into the life and history of Increase Mather. The project was led by Mather students, McDonald said, and inspired by ongoing debates about how best to confront Harvard’s involvement in slavery.
“I think everybody at Harvard is trying to address with this issue of what do you do with this history of slavery. Do you try to erase it pretend it didn’t happen, or do you try to make it available to everybody and make it public so that people can learn from it? That was one of the main motivations that started off this inquiry,” he said.
Rosengarten and McDonald also emphasized that Mather House’s values are not as puritanical as Increase Mather’s were.
"It’s been an objective to make Mather a safe party house. It wouldn’t make Increase very happy,” Rosengarten joked.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the 366th Commencement exercises approaches, many seniors at the College are savoring their last few moments as undergraduates at Harvard. But if any of them take a path similar to Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 after they graduate, though, it will be as if they never left.
Dingman sits on a cream-colored couch, laid back with his legs crossed and his arms perched across the top of the backrest. He talks in a simultaneously relaxed yet attentive tone, his booming voice echoing across the white walls and bookcases in his office. Dingman is clearly at home in his office in the Freshman Dean’s Office.
After graduating from the College in 1967, Dingman has spent a total of 44 years at Harvard, pursuing his graduate studies and working in a number of administrative positions. Over time, Dingman has carved out a clear niche for himself. Even as he says he’s learned Harvard, he’s shaped it himself—campus would be a very different place without him patrolling the Yard in his distinctive bright-red jacket.
Dingman came to Harvard from rural Connecticut after being admitted off the waitlist in the summer of 1963 as a member of the Class of 1967.
“I went to a small high school, thirty students in my graduating class, so Harvard was a bit of a culture shock,” said Dingman. “I had to get used to the much larger size, living in the city, and competition that I had never even begun to consider before.”
Dingman was a resident of Grays Hall his freshmen year and a resident of Eliot House as an upperclassman. He recalls playing intramural sports for Eliot and taking history tutorials within the House.
Dingman declared a concentration in History. In his junior year and the summer before his senior year, Dingman worked on writing a senior honors thesis, but eventually decided to drop the thesis. Although he has said that dropping his thesis troubled him at the time, he now sees his unsuccessful thesis as a growing experience.
Despite his academic inclinations, Dingman also took advantage of other athletic and social resources available at Harvard.
As a freshman, Dingman played on the freshman tennis and hockey teams. After he failed a Physics midterm and was told he should devote more time to his coursework, Dingman quit the hockey team.
According to Dingman, the friendships he formed as a freshman played a larger role in setting the tone for the rest of his time as an undergrad than the subsequent three years he spent living in Eliot House.
“I made several friends that continue to be some of my closest friends today, and that all happened within the Yard,” said Dingman. “People talk about the House system as sort of the crown jewel, but what they forget is that we have a four year residential system, and I’ve been determined to make sure that in the first year, there really is a distinctive experience.”
Many of those Dingman met in his freshman year went on to become some of his closest friends. Dudley F. Blodget ’67 and Dingman met on the freshman tennis team in 1963 and Blodget went on to be the best man in Dingman’s wedding. Dingman also officiated Blodget’s wedding.
“He is an amazing guy, eternally young and energetic, he is totally devoted to Harvard and each year’s freshmen class. He will run through walls for Harvard and any of the students for who he is responsible,” Blodget said. “However, it is irritating that he looks ten years younger than all of his ‘67 classmates.”
Dingman said he often wonders what his Harvard experience would be like if he were a student today.
“When I was a student, Harvard wasn’t anywhere near as diverse a place,” said Dingman. “I think now it would be so much more exciting to be in the College with students who were coming from all parts of the world, with need-blind admissions and much great diversity racially and ethnically.”
Dingman said  many of the changes implemented over the years in the freshman dorms are positive.
“One thing that concerns me is that there was some missed opportunities when I compare my experiences with what is happening today,” Dingman said. “We were allowed to pick roommates, so I chose to live with somebody who also came from a small high school, so that was somewhat limiting.”
Since graduating in 1967, Dingman has held a number of administrative positions at Harvard, though he hasn’t quite spent his whole  life at the University. Soon after graduating, he spent several years teaching secondary school in Connecticut and at Phillips Andover Academy in Massachusetts, working for Ted Sizer, the headmaster at Andover. During this time, he spent  his summers working at Harvard’s Admissions Office.
Dingman’s admission to the Graduate School of Education for his Master’s degree marked the beginning of more than four decades of uninterrupted work at Harvard.
“To my surprise now, I’ve been here ever since,” he said.
Dingman has served as both an assistant to the Dean of the College and the Associate Dean of the College, and was previously a senior tutor in Leverett and Dudley Houses. He also briefly served as Interim Dean of Student Life after Stephen M. Lassonde stepped down from the deanship in January 2016 until Katherine O’Dair took over the position of Dean of Students in August of last year.
Despite this long list of positions in university administration, Dingman’s most prized title is his role as the Dean of Freshmen, a position he took over in 2004. He oversees academic, social, and residential life for College students in their first year.
“The changing nature of my work has kept me really excited about going to the office everyday,” said Dingman.
If there’s one aspect of Dingman’s job that he takes pride in the most, it’s the care that goes into creating a first year experience for students that is more enriching than the one he had fifty years ago.
“Now, we spend five weeks matching roommates by hand and we put you into entryways where you’re not going to find people who look just like you but where we hope there will be an ability to get along and learn from each other’s differences,” he said.
He keeps his own transition in mind today when working to cultivate an accessible freshmen year experience. He aims to do this through implementing programming like the First-Year Experience, a series of workshops and panels hosted for freshmen on topics like going to office hours, getting along with roommates, and managing time.
“If you can get the right start freshmen year, I think you’re set up for success for the years after,” said Dingman. “We do know a number of students struggle to find a place here and a sense of belonging. When you read about experiences like that on end-of-year surveys, it stings, but we’re really working hard on it.”
According to Undergraduate Council Vice-President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18, Dingman’s dedication to students is his stand-out feature.
“He is definitely one of the most dedicated people I've had the pleasure of working with at Harvard. He just really cares so deeply for students and especially the freshmen experience,” he said.
Dingman said that working with students and finding new ways to make Harvard a more inclusive university was one of his favorite aspects of his job, which he described as “remarkable.”
“I think I’ve worked for seven different deans of the College and felt I learned something significant from each of them,” Dingman said. “I think I have the best job at Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a crowd of 13,000 filling the Boston Garden, the premier Boston sports venue before TD Garden, Harvard hockey goalie William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 wowed the crowd in 1965 with 43 saves amid a disappointing first round Beanpot loss to the Boston College Eagles.
“The Eagles' great speed and size enabled them to overpower the Crimson defense, but [Fitzsimmons] rarely failed to hold his ground,” The Crimson wrote at the time. “Fitzsimmons was perfect.”
Though the Crimson would end up losing the following consolation game against Northeastern as well, the season would be no loss for the sophomore Fitzsimmons. Saving 91 goals throughout the tournament and only allowing 8 goals past him, the young goalie had broken the record for number of saves in a Beanpot tournament.
“He was incandescent,” Wade M. Welch ’65, then senior goalie on the team, said of Fitzsimmons. “We lost both games but he was unbelievable. He was a delight to behold in the Beanpot.”
Five decades after leaving Harvard, Fitzsimmons, known to his friends as “Fitz” or “Fitzy,” has remained a fixture on campus. Now Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid, Fitzsimmons still holds his college hockey record and has surely not forgotten his days in the College.
“To say that my four years were transformative would be a colossal understatement,” Fitzsimmons wrote in an email to The Crimson.
As a first-generation student on campus, Fitzsimmons was involved in much more than the freshman and varsity hockey teams. He was a member of the Mental Hospitals Committee of the Phillips Brooks House, a solicitor for the Combined Charities Drive, and a member of Dorm Crew.
Educated at the Catholic Archbishop Williams High School only fifteen miles from Harvard’s campus, Fitzsimmons also retained strong ties to his faith background during his time at the College as a Catechism teacher and member of the Catholic Students Association.
Keeping active politically with the Harvard-Radcliffe Young Democrats and socially with the now-defunct Pi Eta Club, Fitzsimmons stayed busy during his undergraduate years and had left a positive impression with those that knew him well.
As an undergraduate, Fitzsimmons, a resident of Kirkland House, concentrated in Social Relations and was described by his four-year roommate Michael Casey ’67 as a “good student” and “hard worker.”
“He was an outstanding student and in true Harvard fashion, spent the last half of his senior year writing his thesis instead of being peppered by pucks,”  William E. Diercks ’69, teammate on the varsity hockey team, wrote in an email.
Through all the studying, however, Fitzsimmons was able to have time to enjoy other pastimes, including playing cards with friends. Freshman and sophomore-year roommate Michael B. Dolan ’67 recalled that playing Hearts was a favorite pastime of Fitzsimmons’s.
“Freshman year was all nose to the grindstone,” Casey added. “After that we probably spent a little time playing cards that we should’ve spent studying, but we managed to graduate anyway.”
Fitzsimmons’s taste in music was also fondly remembered by his Lionel A-31 roommates, both of whom according to Casey did not bring any music of their own to Harvard.
“His true favorite, true love in music was Tony Bennett,” Dolan said, “And so he had a Hi-Fi system that he played Tony Bennett all the time.”
Most of all though, he had a diverse friend group with “quite different interests and backgrounds,” and according to Dolan, Fitzsimmons was able to get along well with all of them. According to both Casey and Dolan, Fitzsimmons was “easygoing” and a great friend to have.
“He’s easy to get along with, we never had any squabbles of any kind and continued to room together because we were pretty compatible,” Casey said. “Good choice on our parts to be roommates.”
As a member of the hockey team, Fitzsimmons was seen as a rising star, who joined a tough season for the Crimson and was dedicated to the team. Welch fondly recalls Fitzsimmons’s underdog role during a close game the team played against Cornell, in which a brawl broke out.
“The Cornell goalie was going to enter into the brawl, and lo, Billy Fitz from 100 feet down the rink comes flying up and tackles the Cornell goalie, evening the slate,” Welch said.
Alan D. Bersin ’68, remembered Fitzsimmons as having played a unique role in Pi Eta, a social club which catered to students from blue-collar backgrounds who identified less with a traditional elite final club demographic.
“At the Pi Eta, you could always find him willing to engage in intelligent discussion, not something that was always the case at the Pi Eta Club,” Bersin said.
Even today, Fitzsimmons still continues to maintain friendships with several of his classmates. According to Welch, Fitzsimmons will always “return my note.” Remaining an avid athlete, Fitzsimmons often golfs and travels with classmates, including Joseph J. O’Donnell ’67, who recalled a longtime friendship in the works.
“Fitzy and I were a little bit kindred spirits,” O’Donnell, currently a fellow of the Harvard Corporation, said. “Our friendship lasted through school...in the 50 years since then we have become very close friends.”
Throughout his time at the College, Fitzsimmons remained in close touch with his family, only a few miles away in Weymouth, Mass., where he was raised. During their first year, Dolan, a South Dakota native new to the East Coast, recalled being “adopted” and taken in by the Fitzsimmons family.
“I was a strange person to them because they had never really met anyone from the Midwest, and they were quite exotic for me as well,” Dolan said.
Visiting the family with Fitzsimmons frequently on weekends, Dolan particularly noted the closeness of the family, which consisted of Fitzsimmons, his two parents, and three brothers.
“They were just supportive of each other and I thought that was a wonderful tradition which was really the result of I think his parents which engendered that spirit within the family,” Dolan said. “All very close.”
Additionally, Fitzsimmons also held a close connection with his high school, where he has twice spoke at their graduation. In recognition of his achievements, Archbishop Williams inducted Fitzsimmons into both the school’s Athletic and Academic Hall of Fame, making him the first graduate honored for contributions on the classroom and the field.
Friends and colleagues say these ties to his roots have remained with him throughout and have manifested themselves in the way in which Fitzsimmons leads the Admissions Office.
“One of the things that makes him distinct here at Harvard...is that he never loses the sense of his family’s stories,” said Marlyn E. McGrath ’70, director of admissions at the College. “What he knows is that families are different and he has a particular family story...For a kid from Weymouth, he has a remarkable sense of the complexity of the United States in every cultural way you can imagine.”
McGrath has referred to Fitzsimmons as the creative leader and spearhead of Harvard’s modern financial aid program, which has been recognized as providing access for students of all backgrounds to Harvard.
“Harvard’s been I think at the forefront of really creating a meritocracy, and it’s altogether fitting and proper that...Dean Fitzsimmons presided over that gateway,” Bersin said. “He became a gatekeeper that helped to change the face of America.”
Having assumed the deanship in 1986, Fitzsimmons has served in his current role now for more than 30 years and has been with Harvard even before then, both in the admissions office and briefly with the Harvard College Fund. Even immediately upon graduation, Fitzsimmons had opted to stay around campus and attend the Graduate School of Education for his Master’s and doctorate degrees.
“Both the graduate study and variety of ancillary experiences proved rewarding,” Fitzsimmons wrote in the Class of 1967’s Fifth Anniversary Report.
The long-term commitment and passion for Harvard that Fitzsimmons has held has been ubiquitously recognized by his classmates.
“When I think of Fitzy, the first thing I think about is his passion for the task—his passion for Harvard and to put the right kind of class together,” O’Donnell said. “That’s an art form, that’s not a science.”
During his time as an undergraduate, most did not predict that Fitzsimmons would become such an established member of the Harvard administration, but they had to admit that they were not surprised.
“I’m not surprised only because he fit in well with Harvard, and he was a well known jockey, a jock...and then he went into the field of education,” Dolan said. “So in some respects I wasn’t surprised that he went back to Harvard in an administrative capacity and has stayed there all these years.”
Having worked with Fitzsimmons for several decades, McGrath believes that Fitzsimmons’s commitment to the University stems from a gratitude for “opportunities that Harvard provided for him” and an affinity for working with students, Welch said.
For Fitzsimmons himself, though, the ability to give back to other students around the world was the most exciting.
“I realized how precious an opportunity it was to attend Harvard and that there were many students from across the nation and around the world who might never think of applying,” Fitzsimmons wrote. “So when I had the opportunity to work in the admissions office in 1972, I jumped at it.”
The dedication Fitzsimmons has had for Harvard and the role he has held in shaping the course of admissions for the University have created long lasting impacts, which have been recognized by several of his classmates.
“In the course of a lifetime you begin to measure the legacy of classmates,” Bersin said. “He chose the road less traveled by, and that made all the difference for many many many young people in America with a beneficial impact on the fabric of this country.”

Dear White People
You will surely recognize a lot of your classmates in the students of Winchester University, a fictional “ninth Ivy.” Depicting the realities faced by people of color in elite institutions, “Dear White People” reminds us that we are not as “woke” we would like to think and the college reality is not as post-racial as our administrators depict it.

These culinary geniuses treat food with more love and inspiration than John does freshman ID’s, with their scrumptious masterpieces inspiring us to check out a House cooking class or two next semester.
Chewing Gum
The show’s unique sunny vaudevillian flow and joyful self-awareness will certainly lift up your spirits and give you abs of steel from all the laughing at Tracy’s unfortunate sexual encounters (including an attempted threesome, a gay boyfriend and inappropriately lustful cousin). With a fresh take on the overused “look into the camera” gimmick this show will definitely fill your happiness meter with its bright colors and pure inventiveness.
So sit back, relax and let yourself enjoy some Netflix — don’t worry, your overachievements won’t be going anywhere.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Gregory M. Hewett ’17 and Jenni L. Pfeiffer, a student at the Graduate School of Education, have been together for more than seven years, but it once seemed like their relationship might never get off the ground.
In high school, a mutual friend invited Hewett and Pfeiffer over for a game of pickup football. The two teenagers ran up for a pass at the same time, crashed into each other, and tumbled onto the grass.
A few weeks later, Hewett and Pfeiffer went on their first date: a Zac Brown Band concert, followed by ice cream. More dates followed, and by the end of high school, they were discussing marriage.
Hewett and Pfeiffer met in the fifth grade at Preston Smith Elementary School in Lubbock, Texas. He was the “cool guy,” an athlete who played football and baseball. She was the mysterious new girl whose family had just moved from Colorado.
Hewett had a crush on Pfeiffer, but they hung out with different friend groups. He saw his opening the summer after freshman year, when she broke up with her boyfriend. After their first date, they began seeing each other constantly. They both loved listening to music, and she taught him to dance; they played endless games of frisbee. She went to his football and baseball games, and he watched her play volleyball. They were crowned king and queen of their senior prom, and named “high school sweethearts” in their yearbook.
One day, while driving home after dropping Pfeiffer off at her house, Hewett realized that he might want to marry her someday. She felt the same way. Though he would go to Harvard and she would attend the University of Texas at Austin, they decided to give it a try long-distance.
“My first year at Harvard was tough,” Hewett remembers. “I was missing Jenni a lot. It was hard to find my place in social groups and things.”
But the distance gave Hewett and Pfeiffer a chance to get to know themselves, and each other. On late-night phone calls, they each learned how the other confronted new challenges and stresses. Hewett, a joint concentrator in computer science and electrical engineering, found his home in the Harvard College Engineering Society and on Dunster House’s intramural football and rowing teams. Pfeiffer studied applied learning and development at UT Austin’s College of Education, and worked as a student-teacher.
Pfeiffer traveled to Boston a few times a semester, or Hewett traveled to Austin. In Austin, they kayaked on Lady Bird Lake and ate pizza at Home Slice. In Boston, they strolled through the Common and visited the Museum of Fine Arts.
“Whenever we were together, we never took the time for granted,” Pfeiffer says. “Every moment we had to be together was so special.”
Last February, Pfeiffer and Hewett had planned to spend the weekend of Valentine’s Day together in Austin. But when the date neared, Hewett began sending Pfeiffer short notes containing puzzling clues. First, he said, he wouldn’t be visiting Austin, after all; then, he told her that they’d be going somewhere else, and she might want to pack clothes for warm weather. When Hewett arrived at the airport in Austin, he presented Pfeiffer with two tickets to Florida.
The couple traveled to the Florida Keys, where Hewett’s cousin lives. One night, Hewett took Pfeiffer to a private resort, where the couple boarded a boat and sailed to a beachside hut. They sat a table strewn with rose petals, and an “island photographer” asked if he could snap their picture.
Pfeiffer had a sense of what was coming.
“I’m kind of a penny pincher, so she knew this was it,” Hewett jokes.
Hewett had prepared a speech, but when he got down one knee, his mind went blank. He told her, hands shaking, that he wanted to spend his life with her. She screamed, and said yes.
Pfeiffer soon received more good news. She had been accepted to Harvard’s Graduate School of Education, where, because she had graduated a year early, she would start the following year. In the fall, Pfeiffer moved into an apartment only three minutes away from Dunster House. Now that the couple lives in the same city, they don’t make it to museums as often, but they find that simple activities—like studying together or going out for drinks—feel just as special.
After they graduate, Hewett and Pfeiffer will travel to Dripping Springs, Texas, for the wedding. They’ll honeymoon in Saint Lucia before moving to Seattle, where Hewett will work for Microsoft and Pfeiffer will look for a job as a teacher.
When she sees her elementary school students, especially the fifth-graders, tease and flirt with each other, Pfeiffer can’t help but wonder what the future might hold for them. “I’m like, oh my gosh,” she says. “This was us!”

Rachael C. Stein ’17 and Bridget L. Curzi have shared a lot of fun dates, from driving up to Portland, Maine to playing arcade games on an island off the coast of southern California. But their most memorable, according to the two, occurred at the Boston Dragon Boat Festival last June.

Curzi and Stein had been looking for a dog to adopt for several weeks—their dates, at that point, mostly consisted of visiting pounds. At the festival, they saw a “very cute” dog across the crowd, and decided to approach the dog’s family. It turned out that the dog was up for adoption. “So literally that day we decided to get a dog, and life changed forever,” Stein says.
Indeed, the dog catalyzed Stein and Curzi’s decision to move in together for Stein’s senior year (“I don’t think you can keep dogs in dorms,” Curzi jokes). The two had been dating since 2014, and now live in an apartment in the West End, near Mass General Hospital.
Stein, a sociology concentrator, and Curzi, who manages a co-working space, met online nearly three years ago. Their first date was at Miracle of Science, a “very cute little bar” near MIT, according to Stein. A few months after they started dating, Curzi moved to Los Angeles for six months, during which time Stein visited regularly.
That the two are “polar opposites” makes for a balanced relationship, according to Curzi. Where Curzi is “free-spirited and ‘go-with-the-flow,’” Stein is “logistically sound and slightly more regimented.” Curzi says that Stein is “thoughtful and fun-filled…she plans things so, so well.”
But Curzi plans things well, too—namely her marriage proposal to Stein. Curzi popped the question just this past spring break, when the couple was on vacation in Puerto Rico with Curzi’s sister and her boyfriend. Curzi organized a kayak trip in a bioluminescent bay at night. “So we were paddling out, and with the bioluminescent bay, when you touch the water it lights up, so as soon as it to a point where it was really dark and the water was really lighting up every time you touched it, my code to my sister was, ‘Do you have the bug spray?’ So she was like, ‘Sure do,’ and she paddles over. They got there, iPhone ready, and I just turned around in the kayak and said, ‘Will you marry me?’”
“There was a light-up ring box and everything,” Stein adds. And, because it happened to be St. Patrick’s Day, “everyone was out that night, and it was a good time to celebrate.”
Stein and Curzi are planning on getting married in June 2019; they’ll be living in Boston for the next year, as Stein will be working at BCG. After that, who knows: The couple hopes to spend some time in New York City, and eventually move to the West Coast, because they’re tired of the cold.
Stein says she and Curzi share a group of tight-knit friends and family that Curzi “would literally do anything for.” It’s this dedication and “engagement in the world around her” that Stein so admires in her future spouse.
Mostly, the two anticipate many more memorable dates to come. “We try to have fun. Life’s too short not to go on little adventures,” Curzi says.

How did you meet?: “We met in high school. We were both kind of band nerds. I played trumpet; she played flute. We spent a lot of time in marching band and practicing together. We became really good friends. Eventually we started dating.”
First thing he noticed: “She’s just super nice to everybody, a sweet compassionate person. She has such a warm presence. She is really well loved by her friends. That is just something that just radiates off her, just a genuinely sweet person.”
Your most memorable date?: “I was a senior in high school and she was ready to leave for college. We were both kind of bummed out and not sure what we wanted to do. So we just met at a cute restaurant in Coral Springs. It was kind of early so there was nobody there except for another table. And it was just a really good conversation and we concluded that we really liked each other and we had a strong friendship and a strong emotional connection. It was worth it to continue. So it was a really happy conclusion. And we were talking about this and the other table at the restaurant—it was this older couple—came over to us and they said ‘Oh you kind of remind us of us when we were younger.’ And we were like ‘Wow this was perfect timing and it was such a beautiful moment.’ And they were like ‘Can we buy you a bottle of wine or something?’ and I’m like ‘Hey, I’m 17’ but it was really cute. I think she would say the same.”
How did you propose?: “I kind of knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her around sophomore/junior year of college. There was one time when she visited for my birthday during my sophomore year of college. And I was like this is really great and I could see this going on forever. After that, I picked out a ring and I had a jeweler back at home and we made a custom ring. I was thinking maybe I should do it when we were both finished at school and maybe we should do it when we begin our new life together, because I am beginning medical school so we are moving in together after college. Basically, I got a little antsy because I had the ring and I was like I have to do this thing. So she visited me for a little longer than a week and the second day she was here, I planned this really nice date for us where we went to all of these spots around Cambridge and Boston where we have been to past times she visited. At the end of the day, I proposed to her by the aquarium and it was really nice.”
How would your friends describe the two of you as a couple?: “I think fun, cute, goofy. It is weird because we have known each other for so long. I knew her when she was just a kid and she knew me when I was 15. I was such a weirdo. We kind of take all that stuff and we have grown as individuals. I do not know if I would be the same person had I not dated her, because it is such a formative time. But, we have all of those memories of weird times in high school. It keeps us fun and young.”

Talia Weisberg ’17 and Evan B. Crane, a senior at MIT, noticed each other the first time they met at a Shabbat meal at a rabbi’s house in the fall of 2014. Though Crane had a girlfriend at the time, Weisberg stuck out to him at the meal.

“I remembered thinking that Talia was very intelligent and cute and pretty cool,” Crane says.
At the meal, Weisberg was struck by Crane’s explanation of his personal “Jewish journey.”
“I thought it was really interesting, really sincere and authentic so I also noticed him,” says Weisberg, who concentrates in the comparative study of religion and lives in Lowell House.
The pair met again while helping to plan a series of events between the Jewish communities at their respective universities. But the meeting was not a coincidence.
“Unbeknownst to Talia, I kind of wanted to organize this event so I could spend more time with her because I remembered her being cool,” Crane, who had by then broken up with his previous girlfriend, says.  “Throughout that weekend, I remembered trying to talk to Talia and trying to flirt with her and she was kind of avoiding me the whole time.”
Finally, after the event, with the help of a mutual friend Crane asked Weisberg on a date at J.P Licks, where the pair spent hours talking.
“He was falling asleep. I noticed him getting tired throughout the whole date,” Weisberg says. “But I didn’t want to say to him that he looked tired.”
Crane proposed in late September of 2016. The two had lunch in Harvard Square and then went to J.P. Licks, where they sat at the same table as they had on their first date.
“Talia had no idea that I was nervous. I was nervous as crazy. I was sweating,” Crane says. “When we were at lunch, I went to the bathroom because I was texting with her friend who was bringing the flowers and my friends were coming.”
Though the weather was overcast, Crane asked Weisberg to walk with him on Weeks Footbridge.
“We got approximately halfway and I put my arms down on the rail on the side and started looking out over Cambridge and she started to do the same,” Crane says.  “Then I reached into my bag then I pulled out the ring and I opened the box.”
After Weisberg said yes, the two met with friends to take photos.
“On the way back from Weeks Footbridge, we saw a corgi. It was really exciting,” Weisberg says.
“And that’s how Talia knew it was fate,” Crane adds, laughing.
The wedding will take place on Aug. 20 in a traditional Jewish ceremony. The couple plans to stay in Boston, with Talia planning to work in government and Evan planning to work in biotechnology. They also anticipate going to J.P. Licks a few more times.

How did you two first meet and what were your first impressions?:
Corbin: We were set up on a blind date. So Brittany was serving a mission for the LDS church, and her mission president, the guy who was in charge of her mission, is good friends with my dad. [We went out] after she got home in the summer of 2015.
Brittany: My first impression of Corbin was that he was super easy to talk to, and I could automatically just be myself. We had a really good time. Our date was almost too short—I was hoping it would go longer. We went to dinner.
Corbin: My philosophy with the blind date was to keep it short because you never know how it’s going to turn out. If it’s good then I’ll ask her out again, and it was really good so I asked her out again.

What was your most memorable date?:
B: In the summer we had been dating for a couple of months, and we took a tram up the ski resort Snowbird in Utah. Super pretty views, we were up on the top for a little bit taking pictures. It was just fun to talk the whole way up, and then afterwards we had a little picnic. They had a small concert outside, and it was really fun.
How did you propose?:
I proposed to her on the Weeks Bridge. There’s actually a video of it on Facebook. I got my teammates to help me out. We made signs that said “Marry me?” and we got coordinated with women’s crew coach Liz O’Leary to get two launched boats. So my teammates went on the launch boats after we had our team meeting down at the gym, and they took off and went past the Weeks Bridge. Brittany and I came along and walked on the bridge. They came by on the launch boats and yelled her name and had the signs up, and then she looked and I got down on one knee and proposed. Luckily she said yes.
B: That was on Sept. 24, 2015. We got married on May 21, 2016
Can you tell us a little bit about the wedding?:
B: We got married in the Bountiful Utah LDS temple. It was a kind of a rainy day in the morning, and as soon as we came out to take pictures and be outside it was all sunny and nice and perfect. We had a reception at a golf course in Bountiful. We had an ice cream bar, and dancing and all the traditional stuff. We did our honeymoon to Oahu, Hawaii.
C: There was a lot of family. We had a lot of friends make it out from Harvard, past teammates that came out as well. So it was a lot of fun.
What had the timeline of your marriage been?:
B: We moved back here in August.
C: We dated in Utah, she out and I proposed here and then we had a long distance engagement. And then we got married.
Any post grad plans?:
C: We’re headed back to Utah where I’ll be working on tech startup with my brothers and dad and Charles Zhang.
B: And we’re having a baby boy in September! That’s a big one too.
C: We’re open to suggestions [on names.]
And where do you see yourselves in five years?:
B: We’ll probably have a couple kids.
C: Yup. Definitely still happily married. Maybe grad school? We’ll see. Hopefully things are going well with the start up. I could be maybe in business school later down the line.

When Joan H. Zhang ’17 first met Eric A. Graves ’14, he was the music director of Under Construction, the Christian a capella group for which she was auditioning. An applied mathematics concentrator in Currier House, Graves was immediately impressed by her voice, which he describes as rich, smooth, and comforting. Zhang, now a psychology concentrator in Leverett House, initially found him serious. A tour to Taiwan showed her otherwise.

There, Zhang saw a sillier side of Graves. Conversing with him felt like talking with an old friend; she decided she wanted to know him better. “Over time, we really opened up our shells a little bit, and our true colors meshed pretty well,” she says.
The two interacted together so well that they began dating the summer after he graduated. Graves started working in New York City with Frederic W. Cook and Co, where he currently remains, while Zhang continued her undergraduate studies at Harvard. Still they decided to give long distance and their budding romance a chance.
Though Zhang believes the distance allowed the two to establish their own identities and learn to treasure the rare moments they had together, she does not deny the drawbacks. “It takes a lot of trust between both of us to know that the other person still cares, even when you don’t have the face-to-face time,” she says.
Graves echoes her sentiments. “The distance is like a mixed blessing,” he says. “It’s a good test for the relationship.”
Such trials came in various forms. Zhang recounts an instance in which she debated between choosing a summer internship in New York or one in San Francisco, the latter of which she preferred. When she reached out to Graves for an opinion, he responded by asking her what she wanted. She explains that the moment helped her realize he was the one. “That’s continually been the way that he’s treated me,” she says. “Especially as a woman who wants to be very ambitious, it’s super important to have that partner who is willing to support you and willing to lift you up.”
“Something interesting about [our relationship], at least from my perspective, is that it has been something that’s grown stronger over time,” Graves adds. “The patience builds and the trust builds and the understanding builds.”
In fact, Zhang calls Graves one of her best friends, noting that her friends say the two are perfect for one another. “My blockmates have a verb called ‘Joan’ing out’ because sometimes I’ll just be sitting there and I’ll start daydreaming…. Both of us, in some ways, can go into our own little worlds and just be oblivious,” Zhang says as an example.
The couple also greatly value family, and they share a deep respect for each other. Zhang says that she appreciates Graves’s humility and honesty, while Graves describes Zhang’s ambition and purpose as an excellent model for others. “I’m constantly amazed at how capable she is and how she excels in everything she does,” he says. “Underlying all of that is a passion for a very meaningful topic, which is mental health and tackling mental health issues. It’s very admirable.”
Graves proposed to Zhang on Oct. 21. She had three requests—that the event occur with her family present, be captured on camera, and surprise her—and he successfully fulfilled each one. After an exhausting day at a computer science conference in her hometown Houston, Zhang came home to Graves’s proposal, while her parents overlooked and her brother filmed. “I had butterflies in my stomach. The proposal itself was kind of cheesy, but it was fun,” Graves says.
The couple hopes to hold their wedding in the fall of 2018, tentatively in Houston. Looking 10 years into the future, they see themselves returning to Atlanta, Graves’s hometown, where they can take care of his mentally disabled older brother and hopefully Zhang will have her own healthcare technology start-up.
When asked for three words to describe their relationship, Zhang offers a saying from the Bible: “Love is patient.” From a brief glance into the trust, joy, and selflessness that defines Graves and Zhang’s time together, the description is fitting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear Class of 2017,
There are few things at Harvard that seem as over-the-top as the long black cloak you picked up the other day. Perhaps you dread the scratchy hat and you doubt how you are going to precariously balance it on your head. After all, it’s made of cardboard. The tassels will probably slap your neighbor in the face every time you turn your head. Get ready, Class of 2017, we’re all going to feel it as we don our caps and gowns shortly.
There are reasons we wear regalia, and it is not just to add the pomp into the Pomp and Circumstance. We’d like to believe that it serves as a visual reminder of our relation to one another during this Commencement Week. Silly, yes. Extraneous, perhaps not.
Just a little over a week ago, both of us emerged from the rainy woods after an incredible weekend on the Senior Outdoor Reflection Trip. In just a short 48 hours away from the hustle and bustle of campus, the woods made quiet reflection possible. Thinking holistically about the past four years, we both were struck by the diversity of experience among our classmates. Simultaneously we were overwhelmed by an immense appreciation for the shared place that brought us together. We arrived back to campus, like many of you, feeling refreshed and rejuvenated for the final countdown.
And then, Class of 2017, we crushed Senior Week. We repped our House colors as we faced each other one last time at Senior Olympics, sang our hearts out at Senior Soirée, and took that last chance with Match ’17. Throughout it all, we reconnected with fellow Expos classmates and deepened existing friendships. We were painstakingly aware of the “lasts” as we counted down the hours. Now, as we turn in our sloppy late nights for early mornings in our caps and gowns, we are here to celebrate the culmination of this phase in our lives.
Yet Senior Week and Commencement are just a small part of the journey we have taken these past four years. We often remember the big moments and commemorative ends of an experience, sometimes forgetting the minute details of entire chapters. Late night Felipe’s runs, impromptu snowball fights, daily walks through the Yard, hours spent talking to roommates in the dining halls—these small memories summed together create a lived experience.
The diversity in our experiences is striking, however, and undoubtedly, there are undoubtedly ways in which class unity at a place like Harvard seems impossible. Our concentrations dictate which libraries or labs we live in. (At least we’ll always have Lamont as a shared home though—Lamonsters, unite!) Our Houses build our friend groups, and we create our identities around extracurriculars or organizations we are a part of—not to mention the long distance relationships forced by the Quad/River divide. For many of us, the paths we walk each day are so different. Because of this, sometimes we feel like strangers.The “still waiting to catch a meal sometime” skeleton meme tells it all.
On Thursday, seniors, we are entering a new chapter. We will wear the same gowns and tassels, and we will sit side-by-side in a Yard that has witnessed hundreds of graduations before ours. Despite living 1,600 unique Harvard experiences, these robes remind us that circumstance—these past four years at Harvard—will forever be an adventure that we lived together.  Simply put: We are members of the Class of 2017.
And it is with this sentiment that we are catapulted into the world beyond Harvard’s gates. For nearly 18 years now, academic calendars have served as the blueprints of our lives. For many of us, now is the first time that we are uncertain of what comes next. Without a paint-by-numbers path to guide us as before, we’re left to figure it out for ourselves, and the apprehension is as real as ever. Though we may not know where we are living next year or what the future holds, what we do know is that we’ll always have each other and this community we built together.
As we look back, it’s clear that we have been fundamentally shaped by those around us. As a good friend once put it: imagine yourself as clay, just beginning to dry. As we continue to form ourselves—to stretch and to mold ourselves with each passing year—we have added bits of clay with each interaction and conversation. These experiences don’t just stay with us; they keep us malleable, ready to be changed by all that we may encounter.
We, Class of 2017, are about to fan out into all corners of the world. And as we move forth, we’ll remember that day we wore the same caps and gowns, smiling back on the moments we shared over our four years together. Though we may be entering an uncertain future, we carry comfort and inspiration knowing we’ll always be the Class of 2017.
