Bang! Bang! They hit the ground. Bang! Bang! That awesome sound. Bang! Bang! “Stomp” doesn’t let you down. With 30 brooms, 288 liters of water, 40 newspapers, 12 boxes of matches, 10 wooden poles, 10 garbage can lids, gaff tape and 20 pounds of sand mix, 11 extremely talented percussionist-dancers produce a heart-pounding, crowd pleasing show of smashing, crashing, sticks, kicks, slaps, and claps. Though slightly repetitive at times, “Stomp” uses every domestic object you’ve always wanted to drum with—including the kitchen sink—to create a thrilling and entertaining performance.
Originating in the UK in 1991 and moving to the US in 1996, the “Stomp” travelling circus has been putting on speedy sound spectacles for the last 18 years. And it still hasn’t gotten old. Directors and co-creators Steve McNicholas and Luke Cresswell are always coming up with new ideas to keep “Stomp” alive and kicking. Until October 18, the show is being performed in the Cutler Majestic Theatre at Emerson College, a venue incredible in itself.
The Moulin Rouge-like music hall with ornate moldings and tapestries, though beautiful, presents a stark contrast to the set for “Stomp.” Quite overwhelming at first, it consists of worn and dented street signs, trash cans, construction tools, and metal siding flung across the stage or hung on a tall fence-like rack. It has a rough, rugged feel to it that complements the posh theatre surrounding it. The stage is topped off with loads of sand scattered across the floor. And so the stage is set. Lights rise. Action.
A rag-tag crew of construction workers turned musicians enters and immediately begins to serenade you with the sound of their brooms. They begin to hit everything they can get their hands on—and soon enough you start to do the same. By the time the show is over, the contagious energy will likely have inspired you to find your own percussion instruments—from your program to your cell phone to your Charlie card and the person sitting next to you. It’s quite intoxicating and liberating. Anger, excitement, giddiness—now’s the time to let it out.
They quickly move on to a dishwashing minuet of scrubbing and squeaking, a sonnet of smashing trashcan lids together as cymbals, and endless other combinations of matchbox drums, rubber tonal tubes, bucket snare drums, tossing paint cans, and folding chairs. Every now and then, the team will breakout into a Riverdance-like set of Irish stepping; however, this tap dancing relies on steel-toed construction boots.
With beats probably topping 64th notes, the show is amazing and fun—especially when one of the performers turns to break the fourth-wall and begins to clap suggestively, looking to the audience for a backup beat and challenging its members to keep up.
Sometimes the beats and acts get rather repetitive; there are only so many ways you can slap your knees and chest before it gets kind of old. It’s not that it’s not impressive; the talent is apparent. However, a tribal drum circle of matchboxes is not as exciting as the bang-bang of garbage cans and fire extinguishers. Despite this occasional tediousness, though, the show goes on and is extremely exciting, comical, and compelling. From beginning to end, “Stomp” keeps you engaged and waiting for the next surprise. Filled with intensity, perfect precision, and plenty of broken broomsticks, the show is truly a spectacle.

The lifestyle of the characters in “Last Call”—which debuted at the Loeb Experimental Theatre on Thursday—will seem familiar to many Harvard students. The play centers around three bohemian, upwardly mobile Manhattanites whose nonchalant approach to sex and relationships develops into a convoluted love triangle that eventually collapses. Written and directed by Rheeqrheeq A. Chainey ’11, “Last Call” takes an episodic approach to portraying a complex and emotionally wrenching situation, one Chainey’s script handles with precision and empathy. An excellent production overall, the show’s only flaw is inevitable given the venue; despite the cast’s significant talent, the piece could benefit from older, more mature actors.
“Last Call” focuses on a sexually adventurous graduate student named Ellie (Jacqueline J. Rossi ’12), who casually dates her professor, James (Anthony J. Sterle ’11), and a lawyer, Sara (Vanessa B. Koo ’12). As she confronts difficulties with James and finds herself becoming more attached to Sara, there is a revelation that leads everyone involved to examine themselves and their romantic priorities.
The performances of Koo and Rossi begin solidly and improve throughout the evening, and by the climax of the play, it does not matter that they are too young for their roles—they are completely convincing. The same cannot be said of Sterle’s. The character of James is arrogant, jocular, and openly admits to “always wanting more sex, more weed, more pieces published.” But Ellie must use “Professor” as a term of endearment so we remember that he is not a college student plucked from the audience.
By the end of the first act, it is clear that James’ recklessness is at least partially a façade. The problem is that nothing lies underneath. Perhaps James was meant to be fundamentally empty. Perhaps the same role would seem more nuanced if an older actor were in it. Or perhaps Sterle has just neglected to endow his performance with much needed complexity—although for an actor of such obvious skill, this seems unlikely. Whatever the reason, James does not bring as much to “Last Call” as Sara and Ellie, and at times he feels like a third wheel, albeit one that is necessary to keep the story rolling.
However, the entire cast is very comfortable physically, which is critical in a play so reliant on body language and sexual tension. And despite the void in James’ character and the initial unease that comes from such young actors playing a professor, a lawyer and a graduate student, the cast ultimately rises to the challenge of the play’s demanding plot.
Set designer Snoweria Zhang ’12, who is also a Crimson photographer, matches the skill of the cast, nailing the sophisticated-but-subtle sensibility of New York’s intelligentsia. The main set of Ellie’s apartment is realistic but does not draw attention away from the characters. The sound is far less subtle. In “Last Call,” music is used exactly as it would be in a movie—to augment emotional episodes and to set the mood in moments without dialogue. This is an unusual technique, and the selection of mid-tempo alt-rock, mostly from a few years ago, is tasteful. However, the intimate nature of live theater—especially this play—renders a “soundtrack” unnecessary and overdramatic.
For better or for worse, the soundtrack does make the play feel more like a movie, and because of this, the parallels with Woody Allen’s early work are especially clear. Like Allen’s films, “Last Call” focuses on the sexual and intellectual neuroses of Manhattan’s educated classes. As a writer, Allen lavishes attention on characters that banter and bicker, and so does Chainey. This is where the actors’ otherwise solid performances fall short. Before the story’s key deception is exposed, the deepening relationship between Ellie and Sara is developed over quotidian chatter about job interviews and spilled coffee. Although talented, the actresses do not seem to have devoted as much time to understanding these crucial opening scenes as they have to the later ones; their words feel recited, not organic. But this is a minor issue, and one that is to be expected the first time a play is performed.
If the appeal of “Last Call” initially lies in the guilty pleasure of observing human relationships, knowing that they are about to go horribly wrong, by the end of the play both the characters and the audience have managed to find some truth—both the basic discoveries of who loves whom and about relationships generally. The audience is left with questions about the characters’ intentions, about the meaning of a sigh or a slammed door, but this is as it should be.  Chainey’s story is ultimately successful, and deserves to be performed and interpreted elsewhere.

It seems like Barack Obama just can’t please the American public anymore. A little over a week ago, criticism rained down on the president when his personal bid to bring the 2016 Olympic Games to Chicago fell flat. Then, last Friday, Obama generated almost as much anger for becoming the 2009 recipient of the Nobel Prize in Peace. It’s enough to make a person stop and wonder—is it better to be a winner or a loser, or are both equally objectionable?
Of course, not all criticism has been aimed at the president. Though commentators took aim at Obama for his actions on behalf of the Olympic bid, harsh words over the prize have generally been more directed toward the Nobel Committee for its decision, rather than at Obama himself. Yet the mere existence of a controversy strongly implies a negative critique of the president as being a superficially popular leader who does not have to earn his accolades like everyone else.
Regardless of who is actually getting the brunt of it, the grumblings over Obama’s Nobel Prize are at best unproductive and at worst damaging to the “efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples” that the award purported to recognize.
That is not to say that many around the U.S. and the globe did not have reason to react with surprise and confusion upon hearing that Obama had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize so early in his presidential term. Given that Obama has still not produced many concrete diplomatic accomplishments in the few short months he has been in office, the award seems strangely premature, bestowed as an endorsement of Obama’s vision rather than his actions. Although none of this provides grounds for faulting Obama himself, who clearly didn’t submit his own nomination, the award has left even strong Obama supporters feeling bitter that the president is too highly regarded.
While there may be some truth to this allegation, it seems a tired argument. Despite the international prestige attached to the award, the Nobel Prize in Peace does not, and never has, explicitly reflect the opinion of the world. It was established by the Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel to be administered in Norway, and it should thus come as no shock that the prize recipients may reflect the political leanings of that country. After all, the winners are determined by the Norwegian Nobel Committee (appointed by the Norwegian Parliament), which reviews nominations and makes a decision based on recommendations from Norwegian academics and special advisors to the committee.
Moreover, “peace” is the most nebulous of all the Nobel categories—and the one most difficult to quantify. One could endlessly debate the merits of many Nobel laureates—Henry Kissinger, Yasser Arafat, and Theodore Roosevelt spring immediately to mind—but to what end? Nothing constructive can come of tedious arguments over whether Obama deserved the Nobel. He accepted the prize humbly—and even if he had refused it, Nobel Prize statutes dictate that it would not have gone to anyone else.
The overall level of vitriol surrounding both the president’s “undeserved” Nobel Prize and his failed Olympic bid is bewildering simply because neither is in any way a reflection of seriously flawed leadership, political decision-making, or moral judgment on his part.
Perhaps Obama overestimated his own powers of influence when he appealed to the Olympic Selection Committee, and maybe the time and money he spent flying to and from Copenhagen could have been put to better use. But it’s doubtful that his not making the trip would have magically ended the recession or made Congress agree on a health-care bill. There is little point in making a fuss over an act that damaged nothing except for Chicagoans’ pride.
And in the case of the Nobel, the prize committee deserves criticism for failing to foresee the potential political backlash its actions would cause, but what’s done is done. Even if awarding the Nobel Prize in Peace to Obama was a mistake, it was not an egregious one. The real mistake would be to make so much of this event that it seriously hampers his political and diplomatic initiatives, many of which are admirable. Enough people have said that Obama needs to prove himself worthy of this honor—maybe they should stop their clamoring long enough to let him try.

Friends and family remembered Ariel E.F. Shaker ’10 for her creativity, imagination, and friendship during a memorial service held in Memorial Church on Friday. Shaker passed away last Wednesday night after suffering injuries in a horseback riding accident the week before.
One of the Palo Alto native’s friends from home welcomed those in attendance to the “Ariel Party,” telling everyone that Shaker had said that if she never got married she would just have a big party and call it the “Ariel Party.”
Shaker’s friends from Harvard and from her hometown said Shaker believed that enjoying day-to-day activities was as much of a part of being passionate about life as being dedicated to big goals. Many shared memories from what Cabot House Master Jay M. Harris referred to as “a life extremely well-lived.”
Linkmate John A. Abraham ’10 recalled that Shaker would ask people, “What about it makes you happy?” a phrase that was printed below Shaker’s picture on the cards that were handed out as people walked into the church.
Darius W. Weil ’10 recalled the time that he had spent with Shaker eating the bread she had baked and talking about literature and her dreams of being a writer.
“She knew better than I that people matter most,” Weil said.
Harvard Polo Club Coach Crocker Snow, Jr. ’61 spoke of Shaker’s deep love for horses and added that she was “a true team member.”
Bob Dylan’s music was a recurring theme at the memorial service. Cabot House tutor Richard Johnston talked about Shaker’s love for Dylan and introduced a performance of the song “Farewell Angelina” by a small group of Shaker’s friends. Dylan’s song “I Want You” was played as attendees flooded into Memorial Church before the service and Shaker’s friends also led a group rendition of “Rock Me Mama” toward the end.
“I always thought Ariel was an amazing person, but that’s a mom’s job to think that,” said her mother Teresa Feiock. “You all have helped me to realize that was true.”
Pieces of Shaker’s art work were on display in the entry to the church alongside messages from members of the polo community. More of the Visual and Environmental Studies concentrator’s work will be displayed in the VES office in the Carpenter Center in the coming weeks.

The Harvard-Yenching Library—the largest university library for East Asian research in the Western World—signed an agreement on Friday with the National Library of China to digitize Harvard’s entire 51,500-volume Chinese rare book collection over the next six years.
The digitization work, which will be funded by the NLC but conducted by Harvard librarians, will also allow all of the items in the collection to be examined for damage and treated for conservation if necessary. Harvard and NLC representatives declined to disclose the project’s exact price tag but said that it would cost millions of dollars.
Nancy M. Cline, chief librarian of Harvard College Library, said at the signing ceremony in Widener Library that the project would help preserve rare and aging items in the collection and allow scholars from around the world to access the materials for free.
“When we first embarked on this project just a little less than a year ago, the scope and size seemed incredibly daunting,” Cline said, noting that the two libraries are a half-world apart. “But we realized we shared a commitment to supporting research and scholarship, a strong commitment to caring for heritage materials...and to [creating] high-end digital collections for the future.”
The first three-year phase of the project will begin in January and digitize books from the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, which date from about 960 AD to 1644. The second phase will begin in 2013 and digitize Qing Dynasty books that date from 1644 to 1795.
Furui Zhan, director of the NLC, said at the ceremony that a preliminary survey indicated that more than a third of the titles in Harvard’s collection were not available at the NLC, and that others are different editions of existing books.
“The National Library is very ambitious, so we hope that through this project we can continue to get more funding from the Chinese government to do digitization projects,” Zhan said in Mandarin through a translator at the event.
“If this project with Harvard is successful, we will move on with other libraries that have Chinese rare books,” Zhan said. “Our goal is to develop comprehensive and large databases of Chinese rare books and to make [them] available to all scholars worldwide.”
The NLC, which recently celebrated its 100th anniversary, holds over 26 million volumes and is the third largest national library in the world, Cline noted.
Among the most notable items in Harvard’s collection are two volumes of the Yongle Dadian, a 15th century Chinese encyclopedia that once comprised thousands of volumes, or over 20,000 chapters, but has since been almost entirely scattered, lost, or destroyed.
Wilt Idema, chair of the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations, noted that the Encyclopedia was intended as “a complete compendium of human knowledge” at the time.
Idema said that the digitization of Harvard’s collection would “level the playing field” for researchers around the world.
“It’s an extremely valuable collection, and that’s recognized by the fact that it’s the Chinese National Library that’s basically putting up the money,” Idema said.

CORRECTION
The original version of the Oct. 13 news article "Harvard College Library, China Form Pact" incorrectly stated that China's Qing Dynasty stretched from 1644 to 1795. In fact, some of the Qing Dynasty books to be digitized were from that period, but the Dynasty itself lasted until the early 20th century.

After a period of strategic growth, two of Harvard’s smallest graduate schools are not planning to conduct faculty searches this academic year.
The Harvard Graduate School of Education and Harvard Divinity School—both of which undertook ambitious efforts to strengthen their faculties over the last four and seven years respectively—are not looking for new hires this year, school officials said.
While Harvard’s financial situation has constrained hiring, Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity Judith D. Singer emphasized that the process of bringing in new scholars or promoting junior faculty across the University will continue—just at a slower pace than in years past.
“The outside media would lead you to think that we are not hiring,” Singer said. “That’s not the case. We’re dong fewer searches this year, but we are doing searches.”
Just last month in her welcoming remarks, University President Drew G. Faust reaffirmed the University’s commitment to research and teaching but cautioned that Harvard will need to “look hard” at hiring practices and reevaluate the importance of filling each vacancy.
“The deans are going to say, ‘When someone leaves, is this a role and field that we want to cover? Is our department the right size? Is this an appointment that should be replaced right now, relative to other near term investments we might make?’” Faust said in a September interview.
Between 2003 and 2008, Harvard’s ladder faculty grew by 8 percent, from roughly 1400 positions to 1500.
But in the last three years, Harvard has seen a marked decline in the rate of faculty appointments.
The University has filled roughly 90 ladder faculty positions annually and an average of 75 faculty members have left the University each year for the last five years.
But this year, only 70 new professors will be joining the University.
Of Harvard’s nine other graduate schools, seven reported to The Crimson that they will conduct roughly the same number of open searches as last year—”business as usual,” a spokesperson said.
The Law School and the Medical School were unable to provide information on the number of open searches planned for this academic year.
The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, on the other hand, laid out specific plans last year to bolster its faculty—an initiative that will be implemented under the newly appointed dean Cherry A. Murray.
Murray estimates that the school will need to hire at least 50 additional faculty members over the next decade in order to meet its academic and research goals.
Though the numbers show relatively unchanged hiring patterns, Singer acknowledged that the data may not fully reflect the impact of the $11 billion drop in Harvard’s endowment for the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2009.
Searches for senior faculty appointments often take several years to complete, Singer explained, and some appointments do not arrive on campus immediately after accepting Harvard’s offer.

Almost $4,500 worth of valuables was stolen from the women’s soccer and softball locker rooms last Tuesday—the most recent incident in an unusual string of burglaries that has hit four different Harvard athletic teams in the past month.
The items reported missing to the Harvard University Police Department last week included three iPods, two laptop computers, a wallet, a cell phone, and a gold necklace. Several identification and credit cards, as well as $105 in cash, had also been removed.
Softball player Jessica M. Ferri ’13, who lost an iPod, said only she and one other teammate, who lost a computer, had possessions stolen.
The rest of the missing items were taken from the women’s soccer locker room, which is connected to the softball locker room through a common bathroom.
According to Ferri, locks for individual lockers have always been available upon request, but most of the team felt that the locker room’s code-protected entrance was sufficient protection against theft. Ferri said coaches have now distributed padlocks to all players on the softball team.
All members of the women’s soccer team who were contacted declined to comment.
These burglaries come on the heels of two others that occurred last month. On Sept. 24, over $2,000 worth of possessions, including a laptop and two wallets containing cash, were stolen from the men’s water polo locker room. Six days later, $65 in cash was reported missing from the men’s soccer team locker room at the Dillon Field House.
Egen Atkinson ’10, co-captain of the men’s water polo team, said that the break-ins were “disappointing,” and that they have prompted increased vigilance among coaches and athletes. He added that his teammates now make sure doors are closed securely when exiting the locker room.
Atkinson said that he has “faith” that the athletic department will look into security improvements, possibly including surveillance cameras in hallways or personnel monitoring locker room entrances.
Nathan T. Fry, associate director of athletics, did not say which specific measures will be implemented, but he wrote in an e-mailed statement that “student-athlete safety and security are obviously quite important” and the department is “evaluating enhanced security measures for each of our locker rooms.”
In the meantime, he added, because “Harvard is an open campus in a city environment,” student-athletes “must take the same precautions with their locker room as they do with their dorm room.”

Social activist Geoffrey Canada will receive the Phillips Brooks House Association’s annual Robert Coles “Call of Service” Award in recognition of his community development work, PBHA announced this weekend.
Canada, a 1975 graduate of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, serves as President and CEO of the Harlem Children’s Zone, a non-profit that combats poverty and works to close the achievement gap in a 100-block area in Harlem. The organization employs a comprehensive approach including parenting classes, charter schools, and summer programs.
HCZ has been hailed for its success in bringing at-risk youth up to and beyond grade level in reading and math, and President Barack Obama has pledged to establish twenty “Promise Neighborhoods” modeled on Canada’s work.
“What the Harlem Children’s Zone is doing is on the forefront of the national conversation on child poverty and achievement gap issues,” said PBHA executive director Gene A. Corbin.
Harvard sociology professor William J. Wilson, who is performing a study on the structural and cultural impact of Canada’s work, said he “could not think of a more deserving recipient” of the award.
“Here, we have kids from some of the most impoverished backgrounds and mostly with single parents, whose scores on standardized tests far exceed the overall scores in New York City,” Wilson said. “Canada is a visionary, and he is quite aware of the factors that contribute to positive outcomes for young kids.”
Canada will be third recipient of the “Call of Service” Award, following child advocate Marian Wright Edelman in 2007 and former Vice President Al Gore ’69 last year.
He was chosen to receive the honor through a series of conversations among PBHA volunteers and alumni, culminating in a deciding vote by PBHA student officers.
PBHA President Richard S. Kelley ’10 said that Canada was a clear favorite from the beginning.
“Geoffrey Canada offers an excellent role model,” Kelley said. “He is a Harvard School of Education graduate, and he used what many people see as a privileged education to do real good within a community.”
Canada will receive his award and address students in Memorial Church on Oct. 23 as part of PBHA’s annual Alumni Weekend.

A team of Harvard researchers at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute recently made a significant step in creating clinically-safe, induced pluripotent stem cells, an advance that could be “revolutionary” in treating patients with neuromuscular diseases like Huntington’s and Parkinson’s Diseases, according to the study’s senior author, Lee Rubin.
Induced pluripotent stem cells have the potential to differentiate into any cell type, meaning that they can be introduced as replacements for dead or dysfunctional cells.  Unlike embryonic stem cells, which have never differentiated, they are created by altering existing adult cells.
In 2006, Japanese scientist Shinya Yamanaka first induced stem cells from adult mouse fibroblasts—cells most commonly found in connective tissue—by using viruses to insert four genes into the fibroblasts. These genes worked to reprogram the cells into pluripotent stem cells.
But two of these genes and the viral vectors used in the process can cause cancer, so this system is not ideal for clinical use.
The Harvard study, published in last week’s issue of the journal Cell, identified small molecules that can eliminate the need to use two of the four genes,
“This demonstrates that we’re halfway home, and remarkably we got halfway home with just one chemical,” said Kevin Eggan, assistant professor in Harvard’s Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology and another senior author on the paper, in a press release announcing the paper.
According to Rubin, the team is now searching for small molecules to eliminate the need to use the other two genes.
“We think we can succeed in reprogramming cells completely for unhealthy people,” Rubin said.
Rubin also said this method may prove more practical in a clinical setting as the cells can be induced “using easy-to-buy molecules.”
The advance may also help researchers better understand neuromuscular diseases, Rubin said, because they will be able to convert a patient’s skin cells into the cell type of interest and study the difference between their own healthy and diseased cells.
“This is an important advance, but they’re at the fifty yard line, and need to reach the goal,” said Irving Weissman, professor for clinical investigation in cancer research and professor of developmental biology at Stanford University. “Now that [they have the cells], they need to see how the neurons degenerate.”

On Nov. 3, “Twilight” fans can sink their teeth into the newest installment in the vampire saga, penned not by Stephenie Meyer but by a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization which used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, The Harvard Lampoon.
Vintage Press announced last Tuesday that “Nightlight,” the Lampoon’s parody of the first book of the “Twilight” series, will be distributed to major bookstores around the country, making it the 133-year old organization’s first published book parody in 40 years.
“Nightlight” recounts the tale of Edwart Mullen, an attractive computer nerd with “zero interest in girls,” who is the apple of pale and clumsy Belle Goose’s eye.
Set in the fictional town of Switchblade, Oregon (Meyer’s book occurs in the real town of Forks, Washington), “Nightlight” consists of 160 pages of thwarted romance and vampire-related angst.
“About three things I was absolutely certain,” the book’s jacket cover reads, excerpting a passage from the perspective of the human protagonist Belle Goose. “First, Edwart was most likely my soul mate, maybe. Second, there was a vampire part of him—which I assumed was wildly out of his control—that wanted me dead. And third, I unconditionally, irrevocably, impenetrably, heterogeneously, gynecologically, and disreputably wished he had kissed me.”
The Lampoon last published a book parody in 1969 called “Bored of the Rings,” a retelling of the title novel in J.R.R. Tolkien’s epic trilogy.
Henry N. Beard ’67 and Douglas C. Kenney ’68, the co-authors of the “Lord of the Rings” spoof, founded the National Lampoon in 1970 along with Robert K. Hoffman ’70, who at the time was a senior at the College.
When asked what prompted the Lampoon staff to break their 40-year parody-free streak with “Nightlight,” Matthew K. Grzecki ’10, cited their appreciation of Meyer’s original work.
“The goal was really to increase our chances of meeting Stephenie Meyer one day,” he said. “We really admire her literary prowess. We just hope our book doesn’t offend anyone,” he added wryly.
Pamela M. Rosario Perez ’13, a “Twilight” fan who is enrolled in a freshman seminar on the history and science of blood called “Blood: From Gory to Glory,” said that Meyer’s novel has on occasion been a topic of conversation in the course.
Though Rosario Perez said that she is looking forward to reading the parody, she offered a warning to its authors. “I hope the Lampoon does it in good taste, or else they will offend a lot of ‘Twilight’ fans.”
CORRECTION
The Oct. 13 news article "Lampoon Publishes 'Twilight' Parody" incorrectly stated that the Harvard Lampoon is 143 years old. In fact, the semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine is 133 years old.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Indiana University Professor Elinor Ostrom and University of California at Berkeley Professor Oliver E. Williamson will be the recipients of this year’s Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, the prize committee announced yesterday—to the surprise of some members of the Harvard Economics Department.
Ostrom, the first female recipient of a prize in this category, was recognized for her work concerning economic governance.
Specifically, she showed that common property does not necessarily have to be privatized in order to be efficiently used.
Williamson was recognized for his work arguing that hierarchical organizations such as firms—in addition to markets—can serve as governance structures, allowing them to resolve conflicts in an alternative manner.
“[Yesterday’s] Nobel Prize is timely, as the economic crisis has taught us that we need to understand much better what goes on within large organizations, and what goes on within organizations is not entirely governed by market forces. This is precisely what the Nobel Prize winners and my colleague Oliver Hart have been researching on over the past three decades,” said Harvard Economics Professor Philippe Aghion yesterday.
Aghion said that Harvard’s Oliver S. Hart “went much further than Williamson by constructing a rigorous framework that made the theory of the firm become truly operational and testable.”
Adam M. Guren ’08, a current economics Ph.D. student and former Crimson editorial chair, wrote in an e-mail to the Crimson that, “Bottom Line: Everyone here at Harvard thought that Oliver Hart, who is at Harvard, would and should win with Oliver Williamson, and people are really disappointed that he was not recognized.”
“[It is] to me somewhat surprising that Hart was not among the winners,” Aghion said.
Hart declined to comment on the selection committee’s decision.
This will be the twelfth consecutive year that Harvard has not been represented among the Economic Sciences category winners of the Nobel Prize since Professor Robert C. Merton won the prize in 1997.
Some of the more recent winners undertook their research at Harvard before receiving their prize while at other institutions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ITHACA, N.Y.—Last week, freshman running back Treavor Scales wasn’t in Bethlehem, Penn. for the Lehigh game because he had returned home to attend his grandmother’s funeral.
“I was in fact very close to her,” Scales said. “She and I talked on a regular basis about once a week. She was just such a sweet woman. She wanted me to do the best in everything that I did—everybody in our family, myself and my little brother. She just really wanted us to do everything that we could to succeed in whatever we participated in.”
But in Saturday’s game at Cornell, Scales seemed to channel the words of his grandmother—succeed he did. The Dunwoody, Ga. native netted 92 yards on 23 carries, and ran in two of Harvard’s four touchdowns against the Big Red. After the game, he took the time to thank the woman that had always pushed him to do his best.
“I dedicated this game to [my grandmother],” Scales said. “You play off of emotion in this game, and that’s all you can do.”
FAILURE TO COMMUNICATE
In any Ivy League matchup, one can expect the penalty flags to fly. The stakes of intraleague play—particularly in a league that has just a 10-game season—inevitably increases the intensity. But what characterized the number of Harvard penalties in Ithaca was not unnecessary roughness or illegal contact, but rather mental mistakes and miscues.
The Crimson accrued eight penalties, resulting in 45 yards. Of those, two were false starts and two were delays of game. Harvard also got knocked for an illegal shift and an illegal formation.
The Crimson also breathed new life into a Big Red drive late in the third quarter. Cornell’s Drew Alston punted it into the endzone for a touchback, but as the Harvard offense prepared to take the field, the yellow flag flew. The call, 12 men on the field, undid the punt and gave the Big Red a first down.
“On the kick penalty, on the previous time, we had put two returners out there because there was some wind, and their punter had scattered some kicks,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “We ended up having one too many guys, and I’m pretty sure that was a reflection of having one extra returner. There’s no excuse for it, it’s as simple as that. We put that on ourselves, the coaches, starting with me.”
CENTENNIAL MAN
With Saturday’s win, Murphy improved to 100-53 in his 15-year career as coach at Harvard.
“It feels great to win whether it’s one or one hundred,” Murphy said. “It just feels great to win on the road against a good team. You look at a hundred wins and it’s simply a reflection of being around a lot of great kids and great coaches through the years. All of a sudden, it adds up.”
Murphy ranks second in wins among current Ivy League coaches. Penn’s Al Bagnoli has coached in Philadelphia for 17 years and boasts a 116-56 record.
There are only eight coaches in Ivy League history to accumulate 100+ wins. Carm Cozza, Yale’s coach from 1965 to 1996, has the most career wins in the Ivies with a record of 179-119-5.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ITHACA, N.Y.—Even a quick glance at this year’s Harvard football roster would have shown that the Crimson would be relying on some different faces to win games this season. And on Saturday, Harvard was bolstered by some new names—just not the ones you would expect.
On an afternoon where many of the Crimson’s big names were quiet, it was a pair of freshmen who carried Harvard to a 28-10 victory at Cornell.
Rookies Treavor Scales and Brian Owusu each contributed a pair of big plays—two touchdowns for running back Scales and two interceptions for defensive back Owusu—to cement their roles as players to watch as the Crimson’s season unfolds.
Scales’ stat line—23 carries for 92 yards and two scores—was the breakout performance Harvard had been waiting for from the tailback, who has been buzzed about since his arrival on campus in August.
The rookie showed early promise against Holy Cross and Brown, getting 11 touches for 56 yards in the two contests. But it was a play that was called back against the Bears that gave Crimson fans a taste of what was to come.
In the fourth quarter, Scales took a handoff from junior quarterback Collier Winters and ran, breaking a number of tackles and moving the ball nearly sixty yards up the field as the home crowd roared in support.
But the run never made it into the box score, as junior Chris Lorditch was whistled for holding on the same play, and Harvard was called all the way back to replay the down.
On Saturday, Scales showed that the run wasn’t a fluke.
After missing last week’s game to attend his grandmother’s funeral, the rookie slipped back into his role as junior Gino Gordon’s backup. But with the Crimson’s aerial attack faltering—Winters was 9-of-25 for just 104 yards with one interception—Scales was called into action early and often.
“For the first two games, we had thrown the heck out of the ball, and we talked about working towards balancing our offense,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “What we [have] to do is put it all together...We didn’t throw it so well the last two games. It was nice to be able to go another route.”
Scales—who was named the Ivy League Rookie of the Week—carried the ball for 14 yards on Harvard’s opening drive, including a five-yard punch-in for the Crimson’s first touchdown, and never slowed down.
Though he didn’t come up with a long rush—his longest carry was for eight yards—his consistency chipped away at the Big Red defense. Scales averaged four yards a carry, and lost just four yards on the ground in the game.
And considering the emotional toll the last two weeks has taken on the rookie, his performance is even more impressive.
“It helped coming back to a wonderful support group, which is my team,” Scales said. “Everybody around me was just so welcoming as soon as I got off the plane and got back to campus. ”
The tailback capped his day with a three-yard touchdown run in the fourth.
But while Scales’ offensive breakout was expected, Owusu’s two picks came as a bit more of a pleasant surprise.
In fact, his first interception, which came midway through the first quarter, was on the rookie’s second defensive snap of the year.
“To be on the field itself was a great honor, and to just help this team out and do whatever I can—whether it’s on the sideline pumping our team up or on the field making plays,” Owusu said. “It was great to get that first pick, but you know that’s not what it’s all about. It’s about getting that victory.”
Owusu’s first pick was a momentum-killer for Cornell, who had just gotten the ball back after Harvard’s first touchdown. On the third play of the drive, Big Red quarterback Ben Ganter dropped back and threw the ball up for a short pass. Owusu read the play and hauled the ball in at the Cornell 35-yard line.
Though the Crimson would not capitalize on the chance—senior kicker Patrick Long went wide left on a 25-yard field goal attempt—Owusu did his best to make sure that the Big Red never got a chance to get back in the game.
When Cornell received the ball after Harvard’s second touchdown, Owusu gave the Crimson a repeat performance. On a first-and-10 Big Red play, Ganter aired it out downfield right into Owusu’s waiting hands.
Instead of the Big Red marching into the Harvard red zone, the Crimson hung onto the ball for the final minute of the half to end the threat.
“Working hard in practice, it shows in the game,” said Owusu, who also recorded a tackle. “It’s a privilege just to be out here and just to be able to play ball.”
The two rookies have given Murphy good reason to give them many more chances to play the game they love.
“We’ve got a lot of great kids and playmakers,” Murphy said. “One of the great things about coaching these kids is that, to a man, they’re very humble...You know, it’s an intangible, it’s a dynamic, but if you don’t have that great chemistry it just doesn’t work. These kids are all like that. It’s a pleasure coaching them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ITHACA, N.Y.—In Harvard football’s second Ivy League matchup of the season, the Cornell defense was run over worse than Harvard Yard after a visit from a busload of international tourists. The Crimson rushing attack, spearheaded by junior Gino Gordon and freshman Treavor Scales, combined for 251 yards and four touchdowns, as Harvard (3-1, 2-0 Ivy) defeated Cornell (2-2, 1-1), 28-10, on Saturday afternoon at Schoellkopf Field.
“There’s no doubt who was the better team on the field [Saturday]; that was Harvard,” said Big Red coach Jim Knowles. “If you can’t stop the run, and you can’t run the ball effectively, it makes for a tough game. It makes for a very tough game.”
Cornell gained just 51 yards on the ground, less than half the total produced by Gordon alone.
“I don’t believe that today’s performance was a reflection on how I played—it was more how the offensive line took control of the line of scrimmage,” said Gordon, who finished with 137 rushing yards and one touchdown.
“The holes were wide open, and I just ran through them.”
The Crimson quickly established the run, using a combination of Gordon and Scales to punch the ball 54 yards up the field and into the endzone on its opening drive.
Harvard began the march with three straight rushes from Gordon, who sat out the Crimson’s previous game against Lehigh, for 19 yards. Scales maintained the momentum, taking the next two carries for nine yards, bringing Harvard to the Cornell 26-yard line.
The Crimson finally went to the air on its sixth offensive play, as junior quarterback Collier Winters connected with senior wide receiver Matt Luft for seven yards. But Harvard quickly returned to the ground assault, calling two plays for Gordon that brought the ball to the five-yard line, setting up Scales for the knockout blow. The rookie took the handoff and was barely touched as he marched into the endzone with 8:22 remaining in the first quarter, giving the Crimson an early 7-0 lead that it would not surrender.
Scales’ first-quarter touchdown was the first of his career, and it wasn’t long before he added his second. Scales struck again in the fourth quarter, this time at a more crucial moment in the contest.
The Harvard defense kept the Big Red at bay for the majority of the game’s first three quarters. Freshman cornerback Brian Owusu led the way for the Crimson with two first-half interceptions off Cornell quarterback Ben Ganter, which made the Big Red try out wide receiver Stephen Luizza under center.
Along with solid play from junior safety Collin Zych, who finished the game with eight tackles, Cornell was held to just 114 all-purpose yards at the half.
But despite Harvard’s early lead, the Big Red did not give up without a fight. Down 14-3 in the waning minutes of the third quarter, Cornell stood with the ball at the Harvard 47. After being held to four yards on a rush and two pass attempts from Ganter, it looked as if the Big Red would have to return the ball to the Crimson.
But a Harvard mental error would give Cornell another chance. After the Big Red’s Drew Anston punted the ball into the Crimson endzone, the sideline official flagged Harvard for fielding 12 players, returning the ball to Cornell at the Crimson 29-yard line.
The Big Red would capitalize on this newfound opportunity.
Ganter connected with wide receiver Bryan Walters on three straight throws to the sideline, each for four yards. This set up a 17-yard pass to wide receiver Shane Savage up the middle of the field for a touchdown.
Suddenly it was a one-possession game to start the fourth quarter. But Harvard returned to the run on its second possession of the frame, culminating with its third touchdown score—all but sealing the win.
Starting at the Cornell 37 with 9:34 left in the game, the Crimson began the drive with two runs from Gordon for nine yards. But an illegal formation penalty called on Harvard put the Crimson back where it stared the drive in a third-and-10 situation. Opting to stay with the ground attack, Gordon busted a 15-yard rush up the middle, which moved the chains and kept the clock ticking.
“[Harvard’s] front guys on that [offensive line] and tight ends pushed our [defensive line and] linebackers around and moved the ball effectively,” Knowles said.
Scales took over at the Cornell 20. On his first rushing attempt of the drive, the rookie earned the Crimson another first down, and on his third rush of the drive, he scored his second touchdown of the game, giving Harvard a safe 21-10 lead with 6:35 remaining.
Winters iced the win with a rushing touchdown of his own, taking the ball in from 15 yards out with just nine seconds remaining in the game.
“We probably don’t get a lot of style points [Saturday],” said Crimson coach Tim Murphy, who earned his 100th career win with Harvard with the victory. “But again, when our back was to the wall in the second half, we responded with a lot of grit and found a way to finish a very, very tough, aggressive, hard-nosed Cornell football team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The holiday weekend provided some much-needed rest for many Harvard students, but for the Harvard sailing team, the three-day respite was especially welcome.
For the first and only time during its fall season, the Crimson sailors competed in only one regatta during a weekend, and the co-ed squad had a four-man contingent place third overall at the Moody Trophy in Wakefield, R.I.
The lighter workload and successful showing could not have come at a better time for the Harvard team, as this weekend marked the halfway point of what has so far been a rather disappointing fall campaign.
“The fall season is important because how we do in the fall determines what regattas we are able to attend this upcoming spring and next fall,” junior captain Alan Palmer said. “We got off to a pretty slow start this season, but we are looking to move up the rankings substantially over the next couple of weeks, and our performance this weekend will definitely help.”
Senior Michelle Konstadt also noted the encouraging results obtained by the Crimson, a squad that has dealt with its fair share of injuries and team members studying abroad so far this season.
“This weekend’s regatta might not have been the most competitive,” Konstadt said, “but it was the first time this season that both divisions really sailed well and were able to finish strong. We were pleased with our results this weekend.”
In the A division of racing, Palmer teamed up with classmate Grace Charles, who handled the crewing duties, to place fourth among the 17 teams competing in that division.
The duo claimed two victories on the weekend and finished in the top half in five of the 14 competitions. Four points is all that separated the Harvard pair from the Roger Williams squad that claimed top honors in the top division of racing.
The B division saw the emergence of sophomore skipper Brendan Kopp, who teamed up with his crew Konstadt to take home third place in the division. The duo opened with consecutive runner-up efforts and six top-five finishes in its first seven races, helping place it atop the B-divisional  standings and giving the Crimson the Day 1 lead after Saturday’s competitions.
The pair faltered slightly on Day 2 but only finished outside the top half of the 17-member field three times in 14 races on the weekend.
“We were really happy with how Brendan performed this weekend,” Konstadt said.
“He was injured last year, so it was nice to get him some experience. He was able to handle the wind shifts really well, especially on the first day.”
Despite Harvard’s fall from first place after Day 1, the squad will still look to gain confidence from this weekend’s results and build on the momentum from this weekend throughout the remainder of its fall schedule.
“Unfortunately, the second day was very windy, and we had no extra crews, so we were at a bit of a disadvantage not being able to switch out crews and change up our lineup,” Palmer said. “But this weekend is a good sign of things to come for the rest of fall.”

The Harvard field hockey team may be reaching celebrity status. The Crimson set up an autograph tent after its Saturday contest against Michigan, and young fans of both teams flooded to get the players’ autographs. Maybe Harvard achieved more than one goal for the game, after all.
Coming off of a tough 1-0 loss versus No. 10 Massachusetts, Harvard (4-6) fell to the Wolverines (6-7) at Jordan Field, 3-1.
“Michigan is a very athletic, very skilled team,” Crimson coach Sue Caples said. “We battled them the best we could, [but it was] not enough.”
“Michigan is a very respectable team,” co-captain Elizabeth Goodman-Bacon added. “We were coming off of a good game last Tuesday, and we just really hope to build off of [this game] coming into Ivy play next weekend.”
The Wolverines came out aggressively, earning six penalty corners in the first period. Harvard’s freshman goalkeeper, Cynthia Tassopoulos, recorded three of her game-high 10 saves in the first period of play, but Michigan was able to take advantage of its penalty corner opportunities and went into halftime leading Harvard 3-0.
“We gave up some unfortunate fouls in the circle,” Goodman-Bacon said. “Going into next week, we’re just going to work on our circle defense so that we give up less penalty corners.”
“We need to take care of the ball,” Caples added, “and not give them second-chance opportunities...We just gave them too many chances. In the first half, the big difference was that Michigan was getting to the 50-50 balls, and we were conceding.”
The Wolverines often bypassed the midfield during the game, hitting balls out of the backfield up to their forwards. Caples noted that the Crimson tends to involve its midfielders in its build-up, so Michigan’s strategy of quickly advancing the ball took Harvard’s midfielders out of the game. The Wolverines’ forwards showed tremendous quickness, and the Crimson defense had a tough time dealing with that speed.
After allowing three Michigan goals in the first period, Harvard’s defense stepped up in the second half, preventing the Wolverines from scoring again. Sophomore Allie Kimmel scored the Crimson’s only goal—and her fourth of the season—off of a rebound during Harvard’s third penalty corner with 21:74 remaining in the second half.
“We did a good job of finishing that [play],” Goodman-Bacon said. “It was just a matter of getting tips and getting in front of the goalie.”
“We battled back a little bit in the second half,” Caples added. “We went after them and made good decisions when we couldn’t get to the 50-50 balls, to be in a good defensive position.”
Although Michigan defeated the Crimson, Harvard’s last two games have been against solid, non-conference opponents. The physicality, athleticism, and game tempo that the Crimson has seen in its string of non-conference games have forced the team to play at a higher level.
“We were just a little battle-weary [against Michigan] with the lineup,” Caples said. “We’ve been playing a lot of really good teams. We can be one of those good teams, we just need to do the little things well and execute better. We’re going to play the best to get better.”
Harvard will face a third non-conference team, Boston University, on Wednesday, before getting back into Ivy League play on Saturday against Cornell. Once the luster of these highly-touted matchups wears off, the Crimson will look to sustain its strong play and continue to impress its young fans.
“We’ve played four teams in the top 10,” Caples said. “The plan is that this prepares us for the rest of the Ivy run...and trains us to play at a higher level.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a Big 5 Invitational that saw a lot of teams fluctuate on the leaderboard from Round 1 to Round 2, the Harvard men’s golf team’s consistency earned it an outright sixth-place (301-300-601) in the 17-team tournament—up from last year’s ninth-place finish. But even that isn’t enough for some on the team.
“All in all, we were a a little disappointed with how we finished, especially in comparison to the other Ivy teams,” sophomore Mark Pollak said. “Losing to Yale two weeks in a row has been pretty upsetting.”
Hot off its first-place finish at its home-hosted MacDonald Cup, the Bulldogs took a share of second place this weekend, shooting consecutive 297s over the two-day tournament held at the Philadelphia Cricket Club’s Wissahickon Course.
But the big surprise on the weekend was Penn. After shooting an uninspiring 309 in the first round, the Quakers shot a +7 (291) to jump from tied at 14th in the first round to tied at fourth in the second.
That sudden turnaround can largely be attributed to the drastic improvement the Quakers’ Colin St. Maxens experienced. After shooting an 82 in the first round on the par-71 course, St. Maxens answered with a 65 on Day 2.
“That basically made up for [Penn’s] poor play in the first round,” senior Greg Shuman said. “When you have someone do that, your team is going to have a very very good tournament.’
For the Crimson’s part, the weekend offered mixed results.
Pollak led the team with his +5 (74-73), which earned him a share of seventh.
“I really liked the course,” Pollak said. “It suits my game real well. I played well there last year.”
Shuman and sophomore Tony Grillo both finished within the top 25. Shuman shot a 77 in Round 1 and 73 in Round 2, while Grillo shot a 74 and a 76—both finishing in a six-way tie at 21st.
Captain Danny Mayer and classmate Nick Moseley rounded out the Crimson competition. Moseley finished with a share of 59th at +15 (79-78), while Mayer finished the course at +20 (76-86) for a piece of 73rd.
“[Moseley] found himself in a few really tough positions and bunkers,” Pollak said. “It’s just the luck of the game where you’ll find youself in a position where you can’t advance yourself. You just have to hope to minimize the damahge as best as possible.”
According to Shuman, the conditions this weekend had a significant role in the number of strokes needed to get through the two rounds.
“The golf course played a lot more difficult than it usually is,” Shuman said. “The prevailing wind blew in the opposite direction that it was supposed to.”
As a result of the change in wind, Shuman said players had to drive with the wind on the shorter holes, while they had to drive into the wind on the longer holes.
Pollak echoed his teammates sentiments about the weather and felt it had a part to play in Penn’s reversal.
“The weather the first day was pretty challenging—rain in the morning, windy in the aftrernoon,” Pollak said. “The second day was windy the entire day. Penn’s ability to deal with the wind and rain had a lot to do with their performance.”
Harvard’s fall season reaches its culmination next weekend with the Ivy Match Play at the Bay Club in Mattapoisett, Mass. The Crimson is used to competing in stroke-play all season, so it will use this week to figure out which matches will prove most fruitful.
“This week it’s going to be all matches, one-on-one,” Pollak said. “See who can best handle the different approach.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A tie, in sports, can spark nearly every reaction.  There are victorious ties, heartbreaking ties, and I-can’t-believe-we-played-this-entire-game-just-to-tie ties.
When the No. 8 Harvard men’s soccer team tied 1-1 with Cornell this past Saturday, the reaction was mostly one of relief.
This was due to a slow start, which left the Crimson in jeopardy of losing the important Ivy League matchup. The team came out unfocused, and gave up an early goal.
“We wanted to play before we earned the right to do so,” said second-year Harvard coach Jamie Clark. “We were getting squeezed a little bit [and] trying to play in bad areas.”
Harvard (8-1-1, 1-0-1 Ivy) soon paid the price, falling early to the Big Red (4-3-3, 0-0-2 Ivy) by a goal at 9:26.
Things first went awry when the Crimson failed to win a header on a high pass into the box from a Cornell player. The Big Red gained control, fired one shot at the net, and, after Harvard goalkeeper Austin Harms blocked it, scored on the rebound.
The Crimson had a difficult time shifting the momentum.
“15 minutes in its 1-0,” Clark said. “That gives [Cornell] the energy, and then we’re scrambling for the next 75 minutes. [Cornell] work[s] incredibly hard, and when you give a team a goal, it stokes the fire a little bit.”
Harvard had 23 shots, in contrast to Cornell’s 12. But they weren’t going in, for a few reasons.
“We made some good chances, but [the Cornell players] compete, and we were contested on almost every chance we got,” Clark said.
But the coach and players agreed that the shots were worse than normal.
“Their keeper made a few good saves, but there were a lot of chances that the guys would have normally put away,” freshman forward Brian Rogers said.
But as the game was wrapping up in the 77th minute, the Crimson scored the tying goal. The play started when senior Adam Rousmaniere broke free up the right side and served a ball into the box. Junior Alex Chi made good on the opportunity and knocked the ball into the net.
After Harvard tied the game, the two teams remained at a stalemate for the remainder of regulation and then both ten-minute overtimes. The result was a tie, Cornell’s third of the season and Harvard’s first.
“If we’d lost, I’d be gutted,” Clark said. “This result doesn’t affect us too much—the league is still in our hands, and it shouldn’t hurt our rankings or our NCAA chances. After going down a goal, we’ll take this as a result.”
But there is definitely some lingering disappointment, especially since Cornell was thought to be a weaker team.
“Given the form we’re in, we expected to win,” Rogers said. “It’s not the worst result in the world, but it’s tough to go up to Ithaca and [not win].  It’s a brutal drive and it’s cold.”
The Big Red has enjoyed modest success this season, tying the University of Pennsylvania, 2-2, in their previous game.
“They’ve got new coach, a new energy about them,” Clark said. “You really have to give credit to them. They worked through 110 minutes of effort.”
While the Big Red stood out, Harvard’s play was somewhat underwhelming, at least with respect to scoring.
“I think [Cornell] played well, but it was more us not being able to finish our chances,” Rogers added. “People had some good games outside of the box—Andre played really well, Brian Grimm played really well—but even those guys missed some opportunities.”
Record-wise, it’s as if this game never happened, and the Crimson are moving on accordingly. The Ivy League championship, and the corresponding entry into the NCAA tournament, are still very much in reach.
“It was disappointing that we didn’t come out with a victory, but it doesn’t change what we have to do,” Rogers said. “If we win the rest of our games, we’ll still win the Ivy, which is our main goal.”

The Crimson women’s soccer team extended its winning streak to four over the weekend after toppling Cornell on the road, 2-0.
After its victory over the Big Red (1-9-1, 0-3 Ivy), Harvard (5-5-1, 2-0) is now one of only three teams undefeated in Ivy League play.
In the Crimson’s 3-0 home win against Cornell last season, then-sophomores Christina Hagner and Katherine Sheeleigh each scored a goal. Saturday, Sheeleigh added to her team-leading collection of five goals with a tally in the second half.
The junior forward, named to the Top Drawer Soccer National Team of the Week, was an offensive standout, taking three of the team’s five shots on goal in the first half.
But the Big Red’s keeper, Megan Bartlett, stopped each attempt to keep the game scoreless entering the intermission.
“Their goalie made an amazing save at the end of the half,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said.
Bartlett had a total of six saves—five in the first half and one in the second.
Although unsuccessful in getting on the scoreboard in the first half, the Crimson persisted in attacking the net. It outshot Cornell in each half, 7-4 and 9-6, respectively, and enjoyed a 12-1 advantage in corner kicks.
Eventually, Harvard would break through—not once, but twice.
Freshman Taryn Kurcz netted her first career goal on a header in the 53rd minute of play.
When sophomore Lindsey Kowal played the ball across the penalty area, junior co-captain Gina Wideroff headed the ball back toward the middle, and Kurcz would make the most of the opportunity.
Both Kowal and Wideroff earned assists on the play, helping their team take the lead, 1-0.
The score—which would turn out to be the game winner—helped Kurcz earn the honor of Ivy League Rookie of the Week.
Nearly two minutes after the first strike, freshman Alexandra Conigliaro maneuvered the ball past the Cornell defense and played a through-ball into the possession of Sheeleigh, who completed the play to double Harvard’s lead.
The Crimson’s defense took care of the rest, denying Big Red offensive standouts Maneesha Chitanvis and Sidra Bonner, who each have scored twice this season, from mounting a comeback.
The performance continued Harvard’s run of strong defensive play. The back line has allowed only three goals in its last five games, compiling a 3-1 record during that span.
In another solid showing, senior goalie Lauren Mann had two saves for her fifth victory of the season.
The veteran keeper boasts a 1.67 goals-against average, and the shutout of Cornell marked her third blank sheet of the year.
“The team knew what had to be done, so we kept into the half and were able to score,” Mann said.
The Big Red was unable to end its five-game losing streak, which dates back to September 18, nor its all-time losing streak to Harvard—which has lasted 16 years.
Mann believes that the Crimson will be able to build on its latest victory over its conference rival.
“We’re going to take the win into practice as motivation,” Mann said.
“We just have to go into every Ivy game with the right attitude and mentality.”
Looking to extend its unbeaten league record, the Crimson will stay home to take on Brown Saturday at 11 am.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Close, but no cigar—so went the weekend for the Harvard women’s tennis team at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center Invitational in Flushing, N.Y. The Crimson sent three individuals to the finals of singles flights, but came away with no champions.
“I think the weekend was great for us,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “Very solid and everyone competed well. We had a blast playing at the U.S. Open facility despite the windy and chilly conditions.”
In Flight C of the tournament, freshman Sophie Chang advanced to the finals, defeating three opponents before falling to No. 1 seed Stephanie Kent of Yale, 6-3, 6-4 in the championship. Over the weekend, Chang took down Blakely Ashley of Princeton, 6-2, 6-4 and then defeated Nadia Solomon-Burgess of Liberty in the quarterfinals. Against the No. 2 seed, Boston College’s Alex Kelleher, Chang emerged with a 6-3, 6-3 win.
In Flight D, freshman Alex Lehman cruised past Charlotte Ezratty of Penn and Carey Aboubakare of Brown in straight sets. In the semifinals, Lehman outlasted Joanna Zwirbulis of St. Johns, 4-6, 6-4, 10-7. In the championship, Dartmouth’s Jesse Adler ended Lehman’s run by a score of 6-4, 6-0.
Sophomore Samantha Gridley, in Flight F, was the third Harvard player to make the finals of her draw. She dropped her opponents in straight sets in her first three matches, setting up finals match against the No. 1 seed from Yale, Sarah Lederhandler. Gridley lost the match 6-2, 6-3.
“Of the three that made it to the finals, I would say they’re all tenacious players,” Green said. “They also pump themselves up and show a lot of emotion. That was a driving force for their results.”
In other singles action, freshman Kristin Norton earned a spot in the Flight A singles draw. She responded by defeating the tournament’s No. 1 seed, Bianca Aboubakare of Brown, 6-3, 6-4. In the next round, Norton fell to eventual champion Nicole Bartnik of Columbia, 6-3, 6-0. In the consolation draw, Norton rebounded with a 7-6, 4-6, 10-4 win.
In Flight B, junior captain Sam Rosekrans knocked out Jillian Santos from Binghampton with a 6-3, 6-4 victory. But, in the next round, No. 1 seed Casey Herzberg of Brown, eliminated Rosekrans.
“I think we’re all improving with each tournament,” Rosekrans said. “And we’re getting more confidence, especially since we had the Ivy League schools this weekend—sizing up the competition.”
Sophomore Louise Laciny in Flight G came out on the winning side of two three-set battles to start the tournament, but dropped a three-setter to the eventual champion in the quarterfinals.
In doubles, Norton paired with Rosekrans in Flight A.
The tandem won its first match 8-3 over a team from Liberty College. In the next round, the two fell to No. 3 seed Lenka Hojckova and Sandhya Nagaraj of NC State.
“[Norton and I] were pretty successful and we’ve only played together once before,” Rosekrans said. “We did a lot of formations and that worked well...we have a lot of fun on the court Kristin and I”
In Flight B, Chang and Lehman won their first match 8-5, but fell to a team from Dartmouth in the second round.
“We have a lot of freshman so [we’re] getting use to partnerships and that has been part of our transition this fall,” Green said. [Doubles] has improved tremendously since September.”
The Crimson play next at the ITA East Regional starting October 23.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cruising home from Harlem on Saturday, the Harvard women’s volleyball team must have had Frank Sinatra’s “New York, New York” playing over the team bus’ speakers.
The Crimson (6-9, 2-2 Ivy) played to a tune of a 3-0 shutout of Columbia on Saturday after outperforming Cornell 3-1 during the first leg of its New York road trip.
As the song goes, “Start spreading the news.”
The dominant victories come at a crucial time for Harvard, which started off its Ivy League season with losses to Dartmouth at home and in Durham.
“We went [into Cornell] having the mindset that this isn’t a dress rehearsal—we’re in Ivies now,” sophomore Anne Carroll Ingersoll said. “I think that losing to Dartmouth twice was really an eye opener.”
The new mindset paid off, and Sinatra’s lyrics sum up the rest: “I’m gonna’ make a brand new start of it—in old New York.”
The Crimson will attempt to keep the beat going this weekend at home against the “Killer P’s” of Princeton and Penn.
HARVARD 3, COLUMBIA 0
From the start of the first frame in Levien Gymnasium, it was clear that Harvard’s offense would have little trouble taming the Lions (10-7, 1-3).
Early kills from co-captain Chelsea Ono Horn, sophomore Sandra Lynne Fryhofer, and sophomore Anne Carrol Ingersoll capitalized on Columbia’s troubles serving to give the Crimson a 9-5 lead. The Lions committed 12 serving errors on the night.
Later on, the home team clawed back to tie it at 18-18, but another successful strike from Ono Horn prevented Columbia from taking its first lead in the frame. From there, freshman Taylor Docter unleashed four kills to propel Harvard to a 25-20 victory.
The Crimson hit for a season-high .357 and committed only eight errors on the night. Fryhofer was nearly flawless, hitting for .818 with nine kills and no errors. Five players racked up six kills or more, including 11 from Ingersoll. Facilitating the attack was senior Lily Durwood, who dished out 36 assists.
“Our offensive was out of control,” Ono Horn said. “It was all silly how well we were hitting.”
Although the Lions won the first point of the frame, consistent serving from sophomore Christine Wu and Ono Horn set the scene for a steady accumulation of kills from Docter, Fryhofer, and Ingersoll to lift Harvard to an 11-5 advantage. This time, there would be no resurgence on the other side of the net, and the Crimson led by at least four points throughout the set. Sophomore Mikaelle Comrie notched a kill to end the set at 25-17.
Nine Lions errors early on in the final set put Harvard up, 11-7. Although Columbia regained its footing, the Harvard offense was unrelenting and kept the Lions in a deficit that lasted the entire set, until the shutout was completed by another Columbia service.
HARVARD 3, CORNELL 1
Arriving in Ithaca, the Crimson was hungry for a win. Each of the previous two weekends featured 3-0 shutouts at the hands of Ivy foe Dartmouth that came as a disheartening start to the Ivy season.
The emotion from the previous losses translated to a dominant performance against Cornell in which Harvard proved too much for the Big Red (5-10, 2-2) to handle.
“We played with a lot of passion,” Ono Horn said.
The Crimson put up nine blocks to Cornell’s two, although the lockdown on defense was not fully invoked until the second frame.
Harvard came out onto the court of Newman Arena with all cylinders firing and quickly established a 4-0 lead. The Big Red recomposed itself and assembled an 8-2 run to get back in the game. With the momentum in its favor, Cornell cruised on to a 25-21 set win, refusing to yield the lead once.
“We blocked them a lot and kept them out of their system with our aggressive serving and defense,” Ono Horn said. “As long as we’ve got that, were going to win a lot.”
Something must have clicked during the several minutes in between the first set and the second, as the Crimson took to the court again and shut down the Big Red attack. Over the course of the next three frames, Harvard held Cornell to attack clips of .188, .147 and .000, respectively, to claim each set en route to its first Ivy League victory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Everyone loves a comeback story, but unfortunately for the Harvard men’s water polo team, this weekend didn’t have such a happy ending. The Crimson (5-14, CWPA Northern Division 3-2) fell to Brown (9-6, 3-2) and Iona (5-11, 3-1) in a pair of conference matches at Blodgett Pool Saturday and Sunday afternoon. In both games, Harvard recovered from early setbacks with good team and individual play, but this was not enough to capture a win. After suffering a 15-8 loss against the Bears, the Crimson came up short against the Gaels, losing 14-11.
IONA 14, HARVARD 11
In the second match of the weekend, the Crimson battled it out in a back-and-forth loss against Iona. Although it dropped the contest, Harvard demonstrated it could fix some of the problems nagging it all season.
“For 24 of 32 minutes, [it was] one of the better team performances we’ve had,” junior co-captain Bret Voith said. “[It’s] probably the best we’ve played in the last three weeks.”
Voith led the Crimson offensively with three goals, while co-captain Egen Atkinson and junior Alex Thompson each tallied two of their own. Three other Harvard players combined to contribute three more goals in the loss.
The Crimson began the first half with a quick goal against the Gaels, but after an early timeout, Iona senior Joe Przekota responded with the first of his five goals. The teams continued to alternate offensively, and the Gaels benefited from a fortunate bounce when a shot ricocheted off Harvard sophomore goalie Alexandre Popp to score late in the first quarter. Iona made it two straight with a fast-break goal just before the buzzer.
In the second quarter, defense continued to be an issue for both teams. Crimson freshman Max Eliot scored off a pass from Atkinson to take advantage of an Iona defensive breakdown. But Harvard wasted a 6-on-5 opportunity to allow the Gaels’ Przekota another goal and eventually the lead.
“[The Gaels] did an excellent job of being opportunists,” Farrar said. “We had a lot of missed chances to put the ball away, and they made us pay.”
Harvard came out aggressively in the second half, and Voith scored early to tie the match at 7-7. The co-captain went on to complete a hat trick, but the Gaels took advantage of fast-break opportunities to go on a 4-0 run despite a refocused Crimson defense.
“We had a will to win,” Thompson said about the team’s second-half attitude.
Late in the third quarter, Harvard showed signs of a potential comeback, but both teams’ goalies battled it out with some huge saves in the fourth quarter. And in the end, Iona held on by a three-goal margin.
BROWN 15, HARVARD 8
In Friday’s match against the Bears, the Crimson had highlights in certain aspects of its game, but struggled to bounce back from Brown’s 6-0 run in the first half that proved too much to overcome.
Harvard played well in the opening quarter, and held the Bears to a 3-2 lead. But the Bears put together a damaging streak of goals before halftime.
“If you take out the second quarter, we have a tie game...sort of a lapse in focus there,” Atkinson said. “But there’s no way around it. Hats off to Brown, they definitely came to play.”
Atkinson was one of five Harvard players to record at least one goal in the game, but the true standout was senior goalie Nikhil Balaraman.
“With the mistakes in the first half, we were putting [Balaraman] in a position where it was extremely difficult to block the ball,” Voith said.
Balaraman responded to the high demands with 11 saves in the match.
“Nikhil was the man, make sure you put that in the paper,” Atkinson said. “He was absolutely the man. He blocked a five meter, and two one-on-nobodies...For people who don’t understand water polo, he came up with some one-in-a-hundred saves today.”
The second half marked a positive change in play for the Crimson, especially offensively, but the Bears held onto the lead to hand Harvard its first Northern Division loss.
“[Brown] has a very good team this year, so we hope we get to meet them in the postseason and reverse this [loss], because we’re going to be...coming for them,” Atkinson said.
The Crimson will close out its divisional play this weekend in a home game against Fordham. They will also take on St. Francis to close out the regular season. The team is especially focused on Saturday’s high-stakes match.
“It’s critical,” Farrar said. “[Fordham] has gotten us the last two times we’ve played them, so this is the time for some decisive payback.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They came, they saw, but they did not conquer the Harvard men’s tennis team. That was the case for Alabama or Notre Dame at the Harvard Fall Classic Tournament this weekend, where the young Crimson squad held its own against some tough competition.
“It was a really good weekend for us,” captain Michael Hayes said.
For Harvard and for its opponents, the weekend was about testing themselves.
“Going into it, we knew that the three teams were all top-notch,” junior Aba Omodele-Lucien said. “We were looking at it as an opportunity to improve our games against really tough opponents. We were really looking forward to this weekend, and that attitude really helped.”
“Every guy on our lineup has been improving,” Harvard coach Dave Fish said. “That’s been a pleasant surprise. We have some very good depth, eight-plus solid players [and] some guys after that who are right on their heels.”
The improvement is especially encouraging considering the youth of the team, with Hayes being the only senior.
“It’s interesting,” Hayes said of being the lone senior. “It’s a lot of responsibility. But the freshmen we’ve got are great. They’re a very easy group of freshmen to work with. They bring a lot of energy.”
Freshman Andy Nguyen, in particular, has been impressing this fall and went 3-0 for the weekend.
Nguyen was named the Corey Winn Freshman Player to Watch at the tournament.
Omodele-Lucien played doubles with the freshman this weekend and got to observe his abilities first-hand. For the junior, the experience was one of déja vu, as Nguyen’s brother Dan ’08 was Omodele-Lucien’s doubles partner in his freshman year.
“Extremely talented,” Omodele-Lucien said of the younger Nguyen. “He has a lot of potential. He strikes the ball extremely well. He’s very level-headed, which is one of the hardest things to master. He’s got all the tools, and he’s very athletic, and if he stays focused, he’ll do a lot for the team and for himself.”
Omodele-Lucien was the other star of the weekend, going 2-1 at the number one singles spot for the tournament.
“He beat some ranked players, which is a big deal,” Hayes said.
“That was a really strong performance,” Fish added. “This is really the best sustained play we’ve seen from him.”
“I’m just trying to get better and better,” Omodele-Lucien said. “I’m motivated for my team and for myself, and I think they’re interrelated. And what’s more important, I’m being efficient and practicing the correct things.”
Omodele-Lucien substituted in the top spot for junior Alexei Chijoff-Evans, who was at the All-American National Championships in Tulsa, Okla. Chijoff-Evans lost in the first round to Kallim Stewart of UCLA, 6-1, 6-1. He recieved a bye to the second round of the consolation draw, where he lost to Robin Fahgen of SMU, 6-1, 6-3.
With Chijoff-Evans away, Omodele-Lucien enjoyed the spotlight.
“I love playing against great competition,” he said. “I don’t shy away from that. Playing the top guys is really exciting, and I get to test my ability.”
Dino Bilankov of Minnesota hit Omodele-Lucien with his lone singles loss of the weekend, 6-4, 6-4.
Minnesota was the toughest competition for the Crimson, and only Nguyen and sophomores Alistair Felton and Liinus Hietanmiemi managed victories. Harvard had been much more competitive the day before against Notre Dame.
“We squeezed out a bunch of victories against Notre Dame,” Omodele-Lucien said. “We battled against Minnesota, but we lost.”
The Crimson’s best performance came Sunday against Alabama, the highest ranked of the four teams last spring. Like Harvard, The Crimson Tide was missing its top player, and Cambridge’s Crimson was able to capitalize on these absences.
The day was especially rewarding for Hayes, who struggled against Notre Dame and Minnesota.
“In the third day, I turned it around,” he said. “Next weekend, we have the Northeast Regionals. It was good for me to get some confidence going into that tournament.”
Hayes lost the first set but rallied to win the match against Trey Walston, 4-6, 6-4, 10-7.
For all four schools, the tournament was a chance to test their skills against strong competition.
“This format allowed very good teams to come together,” Fish said. “It allows [us] to see how our players are [compared] to each other and to other teams.”

It's Saturday night, and you're sleeping in your cold, lonely bed in Cabot.  Then you hear someone panting outside your door at 4:30 a.m. "My first impression was that someone was having sex in front of my door and I thought it would stop," a Cabot student related on Cabot-open. The sex-like noises then turned into "vigorous knocking," so the student asked who it was.
"Please open the door," the person on the other side said. "It's not even about you, just open the door." But the Cabot student did not relent:
The police did arrive in 15 minutes but dismissed the issue. The Cabot student, who in a later e-mail dubs himself the "Alfred and Melinda Prufrock Professor of Common Decency," concludes his e-mail by declaring:
Ummm...OK.  The Cabot community's response, including a final intervention by Cabot House Master and Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, after the jump.
After one student relates how she had also heard knocking on different doors that was "really endless" between 4:30 and 5 a.m. and again at 7 a.m., the first Cabot student introduces himself again by listing three lessons for how to ask for help.

Through the haze of early October midterms, you might have noticed some snarky posters popping up around campus this week. Or perhaps a friend of yours has adopted a Facebook profile picture that’s looking suspiciously like a political statement. So what the hell are these posters anyway?
They’re part of the Harvard College Democrats’ recently launched “Five Things You Can Do for Health Care Reform” campaign, and they’re designed to raise awareness of the problems with the modern health care system.
So are they just what the doctor—or Max Baucus—ordered? Find out FlyBy's take after the jump.
Poster 1: "Dude. In Ec 10, that would be an A."
“Say what?!” or “Meh”: “Meh”
Overall grade: C+
Oh, Ec 10 – your perpetual relevance mystifies those of us who have never dared to venture into the whimsical world of Greg Mankiw. But seriously, must every humorous class reference be about Ec 10 or Life Sci? How about a little love for Math 21a or CS50?
Otherwise, a funny punch line for a not-so-interesting statistic. We get that our age group is underinsured, but until you get that hospital bill after celebrating your roommate’s step-sister's half-birthday a too little hard, you’re probably not so prone to understand the risks.
 
Poster 2: "That's Only 62 Times the Number Who've Died from Swine Flu."
"Say what?!” or “Meh”: “Say what?
Overall grade: B –
Wait, so you’re saying swine flu hasn’t killed millions of people, sexually harassed female employees of David Letterman, and stolen Taylor Swift’s moment at the VMAs? It’s so much less evil than we thought! But lack of health insurance is certainly to blame for all of those things then, right?
Minus points because that pig looks like a creepy version of “Babe.”
 
Poster 3: "A Serious Pre-Existing Condition...Like Acne."
“Say what?!” or “Meh”: “Say what?!”
Overall grade: A-
Wait, for serious? That’s a pretty startling fact in its own right. But this poster also works because that picture is downright terrifying. It’s like staring straight into your awkward junior high years and not being able to look away. Good thing you got yourself together in high school and became a suave, sophisticated, acne-free Harvardian.
 
Poster 4: "We've Got Purell."
“Say what?!” or “Meh”: “Meh”
Overall grade: B+
Sure, Purell increases bacterial resistance and is flammable enough to turn every germaphobe into a WMD, but FlyBy can’t deny we love the stuff. A quick pump is all you need to feel spry and healthy and H1N1-free. And props for making something funny out of the newfound ubiquity of hand sanitizer around campus.

Some very widely-circulated statistics say that the average Harvard student will have 2.5 sexual partners in their time here on campus. Apparently, that number quadruples if you are a member of Expressions Dance Company. Well...at least the number of people you dry hump goes up.
As a promotional tool for their upcoming Halloween concert "Experiment," the hip-hop dance group released two videos on YouTube featuring some, how shall we put it...freaky ass scenes. The premise? "What Starts Clean...Must Turn Dirty." Curious yet? See for yourselves after the jump.
Harvard students expressing some sexual frustration. (Update: as of 1:30 a.m., the video has been made private on YouTube.)
Apparently, getting dirty at Harvard starts first with a man making serial killer eyes at a room full of scantily clad women freaking in some poor student's common room (0:30). It also means freaking in the shower (0:34). Or freaking in bed while a fellow student enjoys the show (0:40). Or maybe moving your roommate's shit from the closet into the hall so you can use the closet for some more private freaking (0:47). Better yet? Freaking on a futon while pretending you're Akon (0:50). Or getting back at the Building Manager by freaking his lamp (0:52)-- and no, not that lamp. Having a fully clothed orgy (1:02)! And of course, as these kinds of nights must end, making out with the toilet (1:04). Maybe downing that handle (0:54) wasn't such a good call.
Anyone down to get dirty tonight?
And if that wasn't enough, this one is just awkward.
