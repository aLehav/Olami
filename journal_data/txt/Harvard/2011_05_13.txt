After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Each year, May’s finals period brings with it two things: tourists and finals. We watch from our desks as the tourists walk around the Yard enjoying the weather.  Our only solace is a passive-aggressive thrill we feel every time one of them rubs John Harvard’s foot.  We know perfectly well that they never get the idea of what it is really like here. To that end, we propose a new kind of Harvard tour, a safari if you will, to open up Harvard’s finals period to them.
No more wide-brimmed hats over loudmouthed students with jokes about giving JFK the shaft—instead, a Steve Irwin-esque, but probably safer, guide will show tourists all of the types of Harvard students during finals. The Crimson has compiled this tour to help both veteran safari goers and amateurs in their exploration of the Harvard biosphere.
The Finished– this student is perhaps the most easily observable to the casual naturalist. Preferring outdoor habitats in which to gloat, these can be seen taking walks in the middle of the afternoon and hanging out in front of libraries, just to see the looks on their peers’ faces and enjoy their hard-won schadenfreude.
The Almost Ready—this student can be seen furiously snatching up binders, legal pads, and other office supplies at Staples during the first few days of reading period, determined to, at the very least, finish the semester as organized as they always knew they could be. They can be seen arriving at their House library late at night the night before their final, at the very last, ready to study.
The More-Stressed-Than-You—you probably got a text from this one at the beginning of reading period telling you that you won’t be getting more texts until after finals period. If you bump into them, which is unlikely given that they guard their study space more jealously than Bruce Wayne guards the BatCave and leave it less often, they will probably try to beg off any personal interaction because they “Need to get back!” Impervious to persuasion and the plethora of study breaks held during reading period, if you see this one, take a picture—otherwise no one will believe you.
The Lamonster—this student is certainly the most easy to track and identify but the most rare to see.  Found only in certain floors of Lamont, they leave a faint smell of retirement home wherever they go.  Signs that you are looking at one: Clothing is baggy and worn, but not the fashionable kind, hair is messy but not in the Robert Pattinson hot kind of way, and shaving has clearly taken the back seat, but not in the Matthew McConaughey sexy way.  All in all, this student is close to being the hottest person on campus, if it all weren’t so unintentional.  What to do if you see them: Just walk away, there is a reason that the carrel next to them is the only open seat in Lamont, you might have the space you need for your studying, but good luck concentrating over the smell and nearly visible germ levels.
The Faux Stresser—this student can often be seen in house dining halls, alternating between sipping their fourth coffee of the night (necessary for the second all-nighter in a row).  They are not actually stressed, they have become desensitized to the pressure, hence their constant presence on GChat and Facebook.  However, they want to appear stressed, so they regularly talk about how they “haven’t even started to look at the material for that test tomorrow.”
The Real Stresser—this student shares a habitat with the stress-builder, and in one of the most truly beautiful symbiotic relationships at Harvard, they feed off of each other.  This student is secretly very stressed, but has the presence of mind to try concealing it to appear cooler.  Even more damaging, they have been preparing for finals for quite sometime.  To justify their stress they deny this, and regularly talk about how they “haven’t even started to look at the material for that test tomorrow.”
The Planner—this student is never far from a list or timetable. They can be heard with fellow planners, comparing, to the minute, how far behind they are on their studying.  More often than not, they spend half of their time revising their old timetables.
The Well Prepared—extinct, possibly fictitious, records of this student exist in largely unreliable revisionist biographies of famous graduates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On May 4, Governor Pat Quinn of Illinois declared his intention to withdraw his state from the federal government’s “Secure Communities” program, a crucial component of President Barack Obama’s immigration strategy. The program, initiated under President George W. Bush in 2008, requires police officers to compare the fingerprints of anyone booked in a local police station against Department of Homeland Security databases. States have begun resisting the law by claiming that it is needlessly expensive, will lead to racial profiling, and will not effectively target criminal illegal immigrants.
The problem with these protests against the Secure Communities program and other recent immigration laws—especially last year’s infamous Arizona law—is that they ask the federal government to ignore the enforcement of national law in the face of other considerations. Secure Communities is merely an attempt to stem the tide of undocumented immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border, and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano should continue to maintain her stance that the program be mandatory for all states. Enforcing federal law is not an option, and states should not be led to believe that it is so.
Secure Communities is an effective program because it engages local police officers in the immigration regulation process without overriding the federal government’s broader authority in this area. In particular, the law makes explicit what should already be assumed: Police officers should be checking up on the people they arrest, especially since those arrested are typically those who pose a threat to public safety. Opponents like the National Immigration Forum have resisted Secure Communities by claiming that it will lead to racial profiling; however, all people booked in police stations (regardless of race or ethnicity) would be subject to the fingerprint comparison, eliminating the possibility of racial profiling from the start. Some still argue that racist police officers will find a pretext for arresting Latinos and Mexican-Americans just so they can check their fingerprints; however, if this is the case, the solution lies in the nation’s racial environment rather than in the content of the law itself.
The National Immigration Forum has further suggested that the program will result in unnecessary deportations, since anyone taken into a police station will be compared with the Department of Homeland Security database—not just those who have committed serious or violent crimes. These critics are correct: The law will apply to more than just “criminal aliens.” It may catch some who have committed misdemeanors and some who have committed no crime at all but have entered the country illegally (which is considered a civil violation, rather than a criminal act). Nonetheless, this means that the program simply ensures the enforcement of federal immigration laws; Secure Communities may capture more than “criminal aliens,” but those it does capture will be undocumented citizens who have entered the nation illegally and thus should be deported.
Essentially: Illegal immigrants are currently entering the U.S. at a rate too rapid to quantify or regulate. Under federal law, these immigrants have committed a civil infraction and are thus subject to deportation. Programs that move us closer to enforcement of this federal law should be implemented, and Secure Communities—which avoids racial profiling and unnecessary invasions of civil liberties—represents an effective way of targeting dangerous and illegal U.S. residents. The Obama administration should be commended for continuing to implement this program, and Secretary Napolitano should continue her strong stand in upholding its principles for all states.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you have been reading me since the beginning, you probably noticed that my opinions have an environmental bent. However, you may not have realized just how strongly I feel about environmental issues. Next year, I will be working as an entry-level video game programmer for a very big corporation, so my time on the soapbox has just about run out. So, as my swan song, I want to enumerate some easy ways we Americans can take better care of our environment.
I am proposing these changes because the proper stewardship of our environment is the single most important issue facing the world today. Contrary to how environmentalism can be portrayed, the environment isn’t something “out there” that needs saving—it is also where we all happen to live, and had better make sure it continues to be a hospitable place for us.
First of all, we should encourage people to live where they work. Eliminating the need to commute will reduce global dependence on fossil fuels, prevent carbon emissions, and even reduce deaths due to driving accidents. This can be done easily in any downtown area: Simply take the top half of each office skyscraper and convert it into studio apartments. Instead of driving home each night, workers will simply ride the elevator, and the car can stay in the garage until it’s needed for a weekend surf trip. Purists can still have their white picket fence and backyard so long as they agree to work from home and walk to the supermarket.
Next, we should stop building new residences in places with excessive heating and cooling costs (I’m looking at you, Texas), dramatically elevated risk of natural disasters (Hurricane Katrina, anyone?), or severe water-supply problems (sorry, Los Angeles). Until we stop trying to colonize the desert, we shouldn’t even waste time enforcing environmental building restrictions in temperate zones. Green building codes in Marin County, Calif. Don’t make much of an impact if they just push new housing development out to dry, dry Las Vegas.
Third, we should prevent corporate offices from leaving everything running overnight. Office buildings are not supposed to stay lit up like a Christmas tree even after the late shift goes home to watch Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.
Fourth (but who’s counting?), we should eat less meat, especially red meat. That goes not only for Americans, but also people in the developing world who hope to match American levels of meat consumption. Cattle ranching causes a litany of environmental ills ranging from deforestation to acid rain, and it warms the world faster than car exhaust. Getting people accustomed to eating meat less often can easily be done through providing occasional vegetarian-only lunches at public schools.
Finally, much of the habitat conservation work to be done is outside of our borders, as the U.S. has no rainforests and few biodiversity hotspots. So, the fifth idea is for the U.S. to push for global environmental regulations. This can be via multinational organizations such as the UN or through unilateral actions, such as enforcing economic sanctions toward countries that permit excessive greenhouse emissions, massive deforestation, or unsustainable agricultural practices. My suggestions, which are rooted in conservation, are not “easy” in the sense that turning off the light when leaving a room is easy. In some sense, the changes I want to see are fairly drastic, but they merely require changing our cultural attitudes, not re-writing the laws of physics.
Of course, on the other hand, many economic models predict that the sorts of changes I advocate will come about on their own. For example, some tropical countries may eventually undergo reforestation as their economies diversify beyond exporting raw materials. But how many species will have gone extinct by the time that the invisible hand of the market lifts us out of this mess? How many people will have died from famine or air pollution, or from diseases that could have been cured by drugs found in the rainforest?
Taking better care of our environment doesn’t need to be a protracted struggle, and it does not need to reduce our standard of living or our quality of life. But it does need to happen fast. In less than 20 years, we may have exterminated a fifth of the species on earth and cut down 80 percent of the world’s tropical rainforests. In the U.S., for example, some scientists predict that a mega-drought on the scale of the Dust Bowl will hit the southwest in the coming decades due to climate change.
So, my fellow graduating seniors, take these recommendations to heart. If you go on to public office, some of you may one day put them into practice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last November, a study was published by a group of Harvard psychologists attempting to explain why some people are happier than others. The secret, according to the study’s authors, was that one should not think too much; a wandering mind was linked with unhappiness. “Many philosophical and religious traditions teach that happiness is to be found by living in the moment, and practitioners are trained to resist mind wandering and to ‘be here now,’” the study’s authors concluded.
On similar lines, “All Things Shining,” co-written by Herbert Dreyfus and Harvard philosophy professor Sean Kelly and published in February, argued that meaning in a secular world could be achieved by shaking off the burden of self-consciousness. Whether by losing oneself in the crowd at a political or sporting event, or by losing oneself in a ritual such as brewing the perfect cup of coffee, “the first step is to recognize moments in your existence when you’re absolutely taken over by the utter thrill and wonder and awesomeness of something going on in the moment,” as Kelly put it.
Reading these results, it initially struck me as odd that these Harvard professors—working in a consummately intellectual environment—concluded by highlighting the inadequacies of the intellect. Joy and meaning were to be found in repetitive activity, in boredom, in slowed-down perception—in deliberate activity without thought. I was reminded of a picture I was sent a few months ago: a painting, by a German expressionist, of two people holding hands. Though a portrait of intimacy, each of their heads was surrounded by a thick-bordered cloud filled in with floating clovers and dots. Facing one another, each person stayed sealed off by his own ideas; physically touching, they remained unable to connect. The moral seemed to be that pure intellect could be responsible for unhappiness; at any rate it was not enough on its own.
On further reflection, the professors’ findings seem to point to a larger tendency. Though it is set up to facilitate pure thought and academic study, so much work at Harvard seems to encourage just the opposite—a life lived simply, prioritizing action over inward activity. Burdened with not only self-consciousness but also a consciousness of their own self-consciousness, acutely aware of their location in a particular time and place in history, professors working here often start from the assumption that seeking eternal abstractions is futile, and that one must actually create some impact in the world. In an environment in which everything one does has the potential to seem only an interpretation or clarification of other people’s activities and works, the idea that one must create meaning for oneself still applies.
This ability to transcend mere intellect—it is right to call it anti-intellectualism—is one of Harvard’s greatest qualities. Students can take away the lesson that there is more to life than paper-writing: an appealing vision, even to those who aren’t academically exhausted and on the verge of graduation. Harvard doesn’t only want us to think grand overarching thoughts; it also wants us to pay attention to the concrete—what one can see and hold—and to leave an impression on what actually exists. Calling attention to the limits of “pure” thought can produce a greater appreciation for noticing details, and an ability to find a deep pleasure in small things. That noticing has an ethical angle too: By seeing more, we can be more discriminating and more efficacious in our care, with a greater idea of what will work or won’t in practice.
There is, of course, a certain danger in Kelly and Dreyfus’ argument. They don’t give adequate attention to the idea that anti-intellectualism is a two-step process: One can only really lose self-consciousness after having had it. Their emphasis on ritual seems to imply a loss of thought entirely, which may not be possible or desirable—while the kind of anti-intellectualism Harvard encourages in the best of cases simply gives rank to a certain kind of action, and a certain emphasis on application rooted in pure philosophy yet encouraging behavior beyond it.
From where I’m sitting now, on the highest floor of Lamont, you can see out past the roof’s edge the tops of the trees: they’re glowing now, in the late afternoon light, a sort of luminescent yellow-green like that of mustard flowers. Beside the trees are the red bricks of the buildings, the spire of Memorial Church, a wash of white clouds on a gradient of blue. All of it is lovely, really so lovely. And all the readings I have done here have made me appreciate the scene, and my own appreciation of it. But they have also made me ask—is mere appreciation enough? And how can I make something of this beyond mere thoughts?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Boston club will pay a fee totalling $28,500 to four organizations supporting higher education for black students as part of a settlement in a complaint of discrimination against black Harvard and Yale graduate students and alumni.
On Nov. 20, 2011, Cure Lounge shut down a party for black Harvard and Yale students and alumni in fear that the party was attracting “the wrong crowd,” including “local gang bangers,” inciting allegations of racism by the club management against the party guests.
The Attorney General’s office, which filed a suit against Cure with the Massachusetts Commission against Discrimination (MCAD), announced on Tuesday the four recipients of the $28,500 fine on the club: Freedom House, Cambridge College, Bottom Line Inc., and the United Negro College Fund.
This February, Cure Lounge agreed to apologize to the community and event attendees, send their employees to anti-discrimination workshops, and pay the fine—the benefactors of which were not yet decided at the time.
On the night of the incident, club management told patrons to leave the venue 30 minutes after they had opened the doors.
Management gave patrons a variety of reasons, ranging from “technical difficulties” to “gang activity” to fire code issues.
Cure’s head of security Sherif Hashem gave event organizers a different reason, according to the complaint filed by Coakley and MCAD.
“It’ll be the weed smoking brothers from the other side of Massachusetts Avenue who will want to come in if they see beautiful black women in line, and it will be a problem if we try to turn them away,” Hashem said on the night of the incident.
Club management did not call police, and attendees reported not seeing any suspicious persons in the crowd.
Coakley said she hopes that this occurrence of discrimination will result in constructive change in the future.
“While we cannot change the actions of Cure Lounge the night of the incident, I am pleased that something positive has resulted from our settlement and that we are able to award these grants to help African-American students fulfill their academic ambitions,” Coakley said in a statement. “This funding will help ensure that these young adults have the tools to prepare and apply for higher education and allow them to pursue a path to personal growth and academic achievement.”

Harvard dining hall workers, students and Unite HERE members from across New England marched through the Yard Thursday night holding signs and chanting “we want justice” and “union power.”
The march ended in the area outside of the Holyoke Center where the crowd sung a version of “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” with lyrics adapted for the union.
As the marchers traveled through the yard swinging colorful glow sticks, accompanied by a union-led band, they picked up a number of spectators and drew some students to watch from the sidelines.
Earlier that day, University officials met with members of Unite HERE Local 26—the union that represents Harvard dining hall workers—as part of their contract renegotiations.
Union leadership offered few details about the nature of the negotiations and the University declined to comment late Thursday night.
Members of the Yale dining hall workers’ chapter of Unite HERE also met with University officials in that meeting.
Following that meeting, the union members met with student supporters in First Parish Church before kicking off the rally.
At the church, the two school’s unions discussed the differences in their contracts.
Harvard and Yale workers said they want many of the elements contained in the Yale workers’ contracts to be included in the newest contract for the Harvard dining hall workers, including full-time employment, more job training opportunities for workers, and increased job security.
“In New Haven, we have a source of inspiration,” said Unite HERE Local 26 president Brian Lang, who called five Yale workers up to the stage.
The Yale workers proceeded to discuss the struggle they endured before obtaining their current contract, including 11 strikes. The speakers said their struggle was ultimately worth the pay-off.
“We stand here today with full-time employment. We stand here with no lay-off language—period. We stand here with 100 percent free medical,” said Robert “Bob” Proto, president of Unite HERE Local 35, which represents Yale dining hall workers. “There’s a standard of quality of jobs that Harvard needs to raise up to Yale’s.”
Lang said that the Yale workers made a presentation to Harvard officials during the negotiations earlier in the day Thursday and that the Yale workers presented some “very concrete solutions to the problems we’ve been facing.”
Harvard dining hall workers also spoke during the First Parish Church meeting, saying that they are fighting for a contract that benefits the entire University.
“We’re here tonight to make life better for everybody,” said Ed Childs, a chef in Adams House and a union official. “The problem is there are some people on the other side who do not want to make life better. But we intend to win because we intend to be united, workers, students, and faculty.”
Childs then proceeded to grab the hands of a student and a worker and raised them high, a symbol that would be repeated throughout the night, and drew thunderous applause from the audience.
Students also expressed support for the dining hall workers.
Undergraduate Council president Senan Ebrahim ’12 spoke about the symbiotic relationship between students and dining hall workers.
“Every time I’ve been in a dining hall, workers have had my back,” Ebrahim said. “Now, it’s our turn.”
SLAM member Naimonu A. James ’14 received a standing ovation from the energized attendees when she expressed SLAM’s dedication to the workers’ cause. With over 50 students standing behind her, James said, “No matter what this takes or how long it takes, we’re going to get this done, and we’re going to get each other through it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After nearly 350 years of waiting, Joel Iacoomes, one of the first Native American students to attend Harvard, will finally receive his diploma from the College.
Iacoomes, a member of the Wampanoag tribe who died in a shipwreck just before his graduation in 1665, will be honored with a special posthumous degree at this year’s Commencement exercises on May 26.
“It is fitting that we honor Joel Iacoomes as Harvard marks the 375th anniversary of its founding,” Harvard President Drew G. Faust said in an article in the Harvard Gazette.
“With the presentation of this degree, we also recognize some of the commitments that were fundamental to the founding of Harvard: a commitment to a diversity of students, a commitment to the communities in which the College was founded, and a commitment to the power of education to transform lives,” she said.
Iacoomes was a student at the Harvard Indian College, which was founded in 1655 to fulfill a statement in Harvard’s Charter of 1650 that called for “the education of the English & Indian Youth of this Country in knowledge and godliness.”
The Indian College offered the same classes as the College but did not charge its students for tuition or housing.
Harvard Indian College, however, was torn down in 1698 due to neglect. During its 43 years of existence, only one student—Caleb Cheeshahteaumuck, Iacoomes’ classmate—graduated, out of a total of five students who attended the school.
This posthumous degree symbolizes a special, historic bond between Harvard and the Native American community, said Mashpee Wampanoag Chairman Cedric Cromwell.
“This is a proud day for the Wampanoag people, and I hope it serves to not only illuminate the history of Native Americans and Harvard, but also to pave the way for more Wampanoag students to become the modern day beneficiaries of this complicated history and receive a world class education,” he said.
This is not the first time that an honorary degree for Iacoomes has been discussed. Patrik Johansson, a 2001 graduate of the School of Public Health, petitioned Harvard in 2005 to grant Iacoomes a posthumous degree.
But Harvard denied the request, concluding that “it was not appropriate” to award Iacoomes a posthumous degree. In the past, students were tested orally on their knowledge of Latin and Greek before they could graduate, a task that the College was unable to determine whether or not Iacoomes has completed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
(Part I of this series appeared on May 9. Part II of this series appeared on May 11.)
After graduating from Harvard in 2010, Morgan never bothered ordering his diploma. The document—the symbol of so much hard work—still included his feminine middle name, and it served as a stinging reminder of an identity that Morgan had shed long before.
While still at the College, Morgan, who is trans and has since began transitioning from female to male, had started using male pronouns—he, his, him—and coming out to close friends. As a natural next step, Morgan filed a request with the Registrar that his feminine middle name be omitted from his official school records.
Since the Registrar requires that a student’s name be legally changed before his or her official records are altered, Morgan strategically asked for a name “omission.” Morgan hoped that since middle names tend to be extraneous his request might be granted.
But Morgan, who insisted that his last name not be included in this article to prevent potential discrimination, was shuffled from administrator to administrator until he received a flat out denial.
“I think of my name as something that belongs to me,” Morgan says, his voice slightly cracking with emotion. “It’s surreal, to go to an institutional body and be told, ‘No your name belongs to us,’ and this wasn’t even a name change but a name omission.”
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Michael P. Burke writes in an email that he was not aware of the situation.
A case like Morgan’s asks the simple question of what is in a name, and for individuals like him—someone whose gender identity breaks from the norm—a name change represents a milestone in their transition from one sex to another.
In recognition of that fact and after heavy lobbying by the Trans Task Force, FAS will roll out a new policy next fall that seeks to address individuals like Morgan. The new policy will allow students to choose a “preferred name,” which will allow them to specify a name besides their legal one and represents a victory for trans rights activists on campus.
With policies like these and others, Harvard has recently made strides to better protect and accommodate the needs of its trans population, but trans rights activists say that the University still lacks a tolerant environment for the trans community. While the University has, for example, increased the availability of gender neutral housing and now covers top surgery in the student medical plan, actions at the administrative level have yet to trickle down to its faculty and students to foster a sense of tolerance, trans activists say.
“The level of tolerance and understanding of trans issues on this campus is unacceptable,” says Queer Students and Allies Co-Chair Marco Chan ’11. “You wouldn’t believe the number of times I’ve heard people say, ‘what a hot tranny mess’—and many of these are fairly liberal people who are well-educated and open-minded in a lot of other instances.”
COMING OUT
During his senior year, Morgan, who was a member of the Trans Task Force (TTF) as an undergraduate, facilitated a Trans 101 workshop—a component of the TTF’s educational outreach program—for his House’s tutors. Though he identified as trans at that point, Morgan did not come out to them during the session.
As the session wrapped up, one tutor asked, “Well, how many people are we really talking about here?” Taken aback, Morgan explained that there was a sizeable trans population on campus and said that the tutor might even know some students who were trans without realizing it.
The tutor laughed.
“I felt minimized, like my experience didn’t matter,” Morgan says.
“There is a really pervasive attitude amongst students, administrators, and professors that there aren’t enough trans students to warrant accommodating,” Morgan adds. “It really bothers me on a bunch of levels. It really shouldn’t matter how many of us there are. It’s a matter of principle.”
Because of instances like these, Morgan did not feel comfortable enough to come out at Harvard beyond designated safe spaces. While he explained his sexual identity to the members of the Harvard College Women’s Center, Queer Students and Allies, and the Trans Task Force, in other settings he adopted another identity, a kind of painful shapeshifting that led him to pursue the possibility of gender reassignment surgery.
At the Women’s Center, Morgan used male pronouns. In other extracurricular settings, peers referred to him with female pronouns. Friends who knew him in multiple settings would refer to him as “he” at one organization’s meetings and “she” in another’s.
This selective coming out led to feelings of isolation and exhaustion. In the months after leaving Harvard, Morgan transitioned from female to male, undergoing hormone therapy to begin the process of medically reassigning his sex.
“I partitioned my identity at Harvard,” Morgan says. “I did not feel safe enough to come out everywhere at Harvard.”
Morgan did come out in classroom settings, asking his peers and teachers to refer to him using male pronouns but found that in most cases coming out frequently led to awkward and occasionally passive aggressive responses from other students.
“It’s not like they threw rocks at me, but some students would continue to use the wrong pronouns over and over even though I had said I go by male pronouns,” Morgan says. “I wish I was in an emotional place to have stood up for myself more.”
Some trans men and women on campus have had more positive experiences while transitioning at Harvard.
While studying at the Divinity School, Cameron E. Partridge, now a lecturer at the Divinity School and in the WGS department, medically transitioned from female to male.
At the end of the 2001-2002 academic year, Partridge handed in forms in at the Registrar to file for a name and gender change.  After reading over the files, the Registrar clerk smiled and said, “Welcome to the male gender—it’s served me well!”
A CULTURAL PROBLEM
Starting in the fall of 2011, students will be able to update their preferred name using the online registration tool, according to Burke. It is small victories like this that trans activists have heralded as indicative of increased tolerance and awareness of trans issues at the administrative level.
But Jia Hui Lee '12, a trans rights activist and member of TTF, and others say that there is a disparity between the administration and the faculty and student body. While the administration has taken steps to improve the experience of trans students at the College, there is a lack of awareness among students and faculty regarding the issues facing the trans community.
Trans activists say that while Harvard students are on the whole fairly aware of sexism, racism, and homophobia, they’re significantly less attuned to transphobia and issues surrounding coming out as trans on campus.
This lack of understanding is at the root of many of the uncomfortable moments trans students experience, Morgan says.
Experts, however, say that ignorance about these issues is a nationwide problem.
“Transphobia exists in the broader society and as a result Harvard is not exempt from this,” Sara Kimmel, a psychologist at University Health Services and director of the College’s residential BGLTS tutors, writes in an email. “There is still a need for education to reduce ignorance and the lack of understanding about the transgender community.”
When Morgan came out in informal settings, he would face a barrage of questions. He was asked everything from the most basic, “What does that mean?” to the more personal, “Have you told your family?” and, “Why?”
“I felt like I had to immediately launch into a Trans 101,” Morgan says. “It is basically up to you to teach people, and that’s an unfair burden to put on someone who’s dealing with the process of coming out themselves.”
Meanwhile, the University’s recognition of the Naval Reserve Officers’ Training Corps has pushed the campus’ relatively low-key trans activist community into the limelight.
Following the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” last fall, University President Drew G. Faust recognized NROTC at an official signing ceremony in Loeb House in March—much to the dismay of campus trans activists. The advocates—30 or so of whom protested outside Loeb House during the ceremony—say that military medical policy, which excludes trans-identified individuals, violates Harvard’s non-discrimination policy.
Capitalizing on this attention, the Trans Task Force has held several Trans 101 workshops over the course of the semester. Recently, the TTF ran a workshop for the Harvard University Police Department and hopes to establish a Trans 101 program for teaching fellows at the Bok Learning Center.
Lee and other members of the TTF will be restructuring the organization over the summer to establish a more formal education and outreach branch that will organize events that expose students to trans issues and broader conversations about gender identity.
Looking toward the future, TTF and trans activists hope to better integrate awareness about trans issues into Harvard’s culture.
“This isn’t reinventing the wheel,” Morgan says. “We’re Harvard, I think once we sit down we can figure out how to make our environment more trans friendly. It’s really a matter of people thinking that trans issues are not a priority because they haven’t heard about them.”

We saw these phrases written in chalk in front of the main entrance to the Science Center. One says, "Go for it, LS1b—from a TF," while others say "Good luck," "Summer's almost here," and "Smile!!" A clear reminder that there are only two more days of exams until the start of summer.
