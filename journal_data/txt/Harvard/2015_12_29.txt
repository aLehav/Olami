After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The school’s unrecognized social organizations saw a year of unprecedented scrutiny and tumult, with two formerly male final clubs adding women to their ranks and top administrators becoming increasingly vocal about the clubs’ membership policies and place in Harvard’s history.
In March, one of the groups that would eventually integrate women, the Spee Club, became the subject of controversy and condemnation after members sent a party invitation that many deemed sexist. Just months later in September, however, the club drew praise for becoming the first of the all-male final clubs to invite women to participate in “punch,” the annual process in which students compete for club membership. The move was widely praised, though some were less laudatory.
Although he frequently met behind closed doors with final club leaders, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana refused to comment on what role, if any, he had in the Spee’s decision to integrate women or whether Harvard would consider prohibiting undergraduate affiliation with unrecognized social clubs. Students, meanwhile, hosted multiple off-record meetings about the stratification of the College’s social scene.
Not all of the College’s unrecognized social organizations responded positively to administrative pressures. A graduate member of the A.D. Club circulated a memo in late October outlining a potential legal defense.  A vast majority of undergraduate members of the A.D. Club, meanwhile, signed a letter to graduate board leaders indicating that they “strongly” opposed membership changes.
About a month after the Spee’s announcement, the undergraduate leadership of the Fox Club announced to their graduate board that they would be extending membership to a pre-selected group of women, claiming that Harvard had “forced [their] hand.”
The Fox decision created a rift between supporters and opponents of integration, prompting a special meeting of graduate members in November. The divisions in the graduate board, along with a controversial party, prompted the shuttering of the club’s JFK street house. Meanwhile, the newly-minted female members of the Fox currently enjoy only “provisional” membership, pending confirmation by a graduate board vote in the spring, according to internal club correspondence.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In April, The Crimson broke news that a group of students from Harvard’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences was planning an effort to unionize, a move that could drastically alter the working relationship between Harvard and many of its teaching fellows and Ph.D. seekers. Graduate student teaching fellows have long charged they are overworked and underpaid, but the unionization movement marks a new effort to rally for better living and teaching conditions and follows similar efforts at peer universities like Yale and Columbia.
University President Drew G. Faust has firmly opposed the prospect of unionization, saying that such a relationship would fundamentally change the dynamic between faculty and students from one based in mentorship to one based on labor. The Graduate School’s dean, Xiao-Li Meng, also affirmed his opposition to the union movement in an October message to colleagues. Another document sent to administrators included a list of guidelines on how to respond to the effort: by encouraging discussion but avoiding hostility.
During the fall semester, the students pushing for unionization amped up their efforts to recruit new members. They created a website, and students involved in the movement gained the support of the Graduate Student Council. The movement also partnered with the United Auto Workers Union.
It remains to be seen whether the graduate students’ unionization efforts will bear fruit. For now, they have no legal precedent.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the spring, environmental activists demanding that Harvard divest its endowment from the fossil fuel industry attempted to disrupt University business for a week by blockading Harvard President Drew G. Faust’s office in Massachusetts Hall in an effort they called “Heat Week.”
The group responsible for the blockade, Divest Harvard, had been building momentum for nearly two years—in spring 2014, protesters blockaded Mass. Hall, resulting in the arrest of an undergraduate. In February, protesters from the group occupied the building. Faust condemned the February occupation and maintained her stance that Harvard should not sell its investments in the fossil fuel industry lest such a move politicize the University’s multi-billion dollar endowment. Emphasizing Harvard’s role in producing scientific research to combat climate change, Faust instead hosted a climate change panel the week of the blockade.
During their April “Heat Week,” Divest Harvard blocked the doors of Mass. Hall for six days, camping out overnight and forcing Harvard’s top administrators to work elsewhere. Crowds of alumni and supporters,  including prominent former Harvard professor Cornel R. West ’74, flocked from across the nation to attend rallies the group held.
Divestment supporters did not restrict their activities to Mass. Hall. On multiple occasions, the group blocked the doors to University Hall, where top Faculty of Arts and Sciences administrators work. Led by environmental activist and former Crimson president Bill E. McKibben ’82, Harvard alumni in support of divestment occupied the offices of the Alumni Association for about two days. Some Harvard faculty, too, talked about divestment in their classes that week.
Many administrators remained quiet throughout the week, though Faust offered an ultimatum to protesters: end their blockade, and she would meet with them. Members of Divest Harvard did not meet with her and continued their protest.
Though the “Heat Week” protest put the national spotlight on the divestment movement in the spring, Harvard’s environmental activists significantly quieted down during the fall semester, focusing their efforts on appealing the dismissal of a lawsuit that urges Harvard to divest from fossil fuels.

New Year’s eve can be very stressful, to say the least. First, you have to find a party that you’re willing to stay at for at least a few hours, then you need to scope out someone to kiss at midnight from a room full of people you either a) went to high school with or b) do not know.
Still, everyone says New Year’s Eve should be fun and carefree—a big party to start out the new year. Whether you are home with your family or out with your friends, Flyby has come up with some anxiety-free ways to ensure a successful start to the year:
In Spain, where I come from, during the last minutes of December 31st,  each person prepares a cup with twelve grapes, (or twelve marshmallows, if you have a sweet tooth like me). When the clock strikes 11:59:48 p.m., the countdown begins. Each second, you have to eat a grape. This may seem fairly simple, but around the 8th grape your weaker, less competent friends and family may start choking. Don’t let that distract you: if you are able to eat the twelve grapes in time, you are guaranteed a year worth of good luck.
Of course, we’re in college, and more likely to spend our precious dollars on two buck chuck than a bag of fresh grapes. Flyby doesn’t endorse taking 12 shots in 12 seconds (seriously, do NOT try this at home), but we can imagine that some vodka-infused gummy bears could do the trick if you’re looking for a wild way to ring in the New Year.
If choking on grapes or candy is not part of your ideal New Year’s Eve, there are plenty of other fun traditions to take part in. The Italians, for instance, like to throw furniture out of their window to celebrate the New Year. Out with the old, in with the new. While Yard Ops (or your parents) would likely not be pleased with you throwing furniture out of windows, why not roast some marshmallows over a flame consisting of old psets, exams, and papers? Or if fire is not your style, follow the Italian tradition and toss them out the window, which is likely as close as you’ll get to snow this warm holiday season.
However you choose to ring in 2016, Flyby wishes you a happy and safe New Year's Eve! After all, you only have a few weeks left to rejoice and be merry before spring semester starts up.
