After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Sept. 3, “Terry Winters: The Structure of Things” and “Imogen Cunningham: In Focus” opened at Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts, showcasing experimental prints and critically acclaimed photography. The prints from Terry Winters offer the viewer a particularly technical, even scientific, take on the visual image, and the new photography exhibit provides an opportunity to glimpse a bit of Cunningham’s photographic genius.

“Terry Winters: The Structure of Things” surveys about 50 of Winters’ paintings, prints, and drawings, most of which were made in the 1980s. These works aren’t something most people would hang above their fireplace: Winters often forgoes conventional aesthetic gratification for a more cerebral approach to the visual arts. Cell structures and biological cross-sections, for example, serve as inspiration for a large number of his works. His print “Morula III” (1983-84) evokes the dividing eggs or germ clusters associated with reproduction. But Winter’s use of soft, smudgy blacks, browns, and greys in his creative print series initially masks their technical—and maybe even repulsive—subject matter. A representation of a cell could just as easily be a planetary body, or an amorphous sphere. In other works, where scientific models are less visible, he plays with negative space and spatial perceptions in ways that create a viewing experience that borders on the psychedelic. The small show represented Winters’ portfolio well, displaying a wide but comprehensible range of works, materials, and techniques.

The MFA also opened “Imogen Cunningham: In Focus” this weekend. The show attempts to show a full range of works from Cunningham, a giant of the twentieth-century photography and a pioneering female artist. She famously teamed up with like-minded San Francisco Bay Area photographers to form Group f/64, pioneering sharply-focused, modernist styles. In attempting to capture 50 years of Cunningham’s work in 35 photographs, the show can seem at times somewhat unfocused and scattered. But that’s not to degrade the stellar showcasing of Cunningham’s varied but consistently high-quality production, which ranges from street photography and self-portraits to botanical stills and funky overlays. One famed, particularly striking piece is “The Unmade Bed” (1957), a crisp shot of Cunningham’s tangled bed sheets that feels spontaneous and intimate. And a small section of the exhibit shows a few of her playful self-portrait pieces, in which she captures her reflection, presumably just by chance, on glass surfaces in the midst of shots. Cunningham’s innovative and transformative contributions to modern photography are clearly evident in the showcase.
These two latest additions to the MFA’s fall exhibitions offer an intellectually stimulating experience for the viewer. Winters’ works bring energy to his materials, showing off a uniquely experimental and intentionally technical approach to media. And the chance to see even a limited selection of Cunningham’s best pieces is well worth a trip across the Charles.
“Terry Winters: The Structure of Things” and “Imogen Cunningham: In Focus” will be on view at the MFA through June 18, 2017.

Poetry reading, neo-burlesque performance, and fin-de-siècle brothels are outwardly different forms of art and entertainment. But the Poetry Brothel, started nine years ago in New York by Stephanie Berger and Nicholas Adamski, promises to push back against that assumption. Arriving at Oberon, the American Repertory Theatre’s second stage, on Sept. 9, this interactive experience will feature one-on-one poetry readings, tarot card readings, live music, and burlesque and vaudeville acts.
“When you put a poet and a person in a private place together, we find that people can hear it in a really different way,” Berger said. “Poetry is really valuable to us, and it’s kind of the only art form that people give away for free,” she added.
That’s where the “brothel” aspect of the event comes into play. Actor and musician Charley Layton (a.k.a. Mister Charley) serves as the master of ceremonies, and Berger (a.k.a. “The Madame”) presents the cast of poets, called “poetry whores,” to the audience. Throughout the night, audience members can choose to pay for poker chips which they then use to purchase private readings, set apart from the main-room cabaret. Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky and Harvard English Professor Stephen L. Burt will be featured readers at the Oberon showcase. Certain private readings, depending on the poet, will “cost” more chips than others. Performances by Pinsky and Burt will be two poker chips, Berger said.
“I wouldn’t say that it is satire, but it makes a point about the intimacy of, well, sex work, and the performing arts, and poetry,” Burt, who uses the pronouns they, them, and their, said. “Arts that claim or pretend to give you something of the performer—or to show you something of yourself—are all related to desire in some sense….There are a lot of questions being asked about what’s theatrical, and what’s intimate, and what’s sexy, and the title is part of that,” they added.
In researching the history of jazz in graduate school—and later Argentina’s tango and European modernist painters like Toulouse Lautrec—Berger noticed that brothels often facilitated experimental, expressive art. “There was this culture in brothels where artists were freer to explore elements of sexuality and elements of society,” she said. “In a brothel, social mores kind of go out the window, for better or for worse.”
Despite receiving criticism from the get-go for putting money, sex, sex work, poetry, and art together under the spotlight, Berger maintains that the point of the performance is to start meaningful conversations about these topics and to create a spirit of empowerment. Before becoming self-titled “poetry whores,” poets have to craft characters, hone their abilities, and apply for the position. “Reclaiming the word ‘whore’ has been something that has been empowering,” Berger said. “A ‘poetry whore’ is a badge of honor,” she added.
Patricio Ferrari, a graduate student at Brown, will perform as ‘poetry whore’ Sebastien de Tours. In introducing his character, he writes: “Because I waded. Because I widened. Because I would. Dwell. Eight languages. Backdoor into this keyhole of selves.” According to Ferrari, de Tours is a Frenchman in his early thirties, fond of three-piece suits and writing letters to his lover, an older woman. The poetry, written in English with snippets of French, excerpts text from de Tours’s inspirations including William Shakespeare, Fernando Pessoa, and Alejandra Pizarnik. For Ferrari, the Poetry Brothel’s format shatters preconceived ideas about poetry and performance. “People going to the theater...I don’t know how much poetry they are expecting. My take is that they get more poetry than they think they will get,” he said. “And that’s a good thing.”
The Poetry Brothel’s flair grew from a place that lacked vibrancy, difference, and intrigue. Berger described how she and Adamski attended stuffy poetry readings that did not reflect the beauty of poetry. “There’s, like, pulled-up chairs and halogen lights,” Berger said. They wanted to create an entirely different experience: a softly-lit environment that combines page-based poetry, vintage evening wear, and acrobatics.
When the Poetry Brothel gained traction in New York, Berger and Adamski helped to grow branches of the event in cities from London to Paris to Barcelona. In addition, people contacted the Poetry Brothel to staff private events like birthday parties. For all these iterations, Berger and Adamski have worked to connect with and to highlight local performers. “We kind of realized early on that the Poetry Brothel...had this ability to move around, and it spoke to people in different places and different cultures,” Berger said.
With the Sept. 9 show as the Poetry Brothel’s first test-run performance in the Boston area, Berger said she hopes to establish a permanent branch in a city dominated by universities and residents who appreciate unusual cultural events. To that end, Burt said that the Poetry Brothel fits in well with Oberon’s program of boundary-breaking performances. “It is not a brothel, but it does think about what is performance, and what is intimacy, and what is sexuality,” they said. “And it’s a chance for people who think about performance to think about these things.”

Among Harvard’s many brick buildings and church spires is one aspect that cannot be overlooked: Harvard’s many bridges. Harvard’s bridges have a lot to offer depending on the person. They can be the perfect picture location for the roaming tourists. They also provide the ideal location to jump into the supposedly safe Charles River. Most of all, though, they serve as a convenient path for joggers. While each bridge serves the same main purpose, literally bridging the gap between Cambridge and Boston, Harvard’s bridges each have a distinct personality to explore.

Anderson Memorial Bridge

Anderson Memorial Bridge, better known as the bridge that’s been under construction since who knows when, may seem aesthetically unpleasant. One would have to know what it looks like underneath all the dust and barricades from construction to truly make a judgment on that, though. Regardless, Anderson Memorial Bridge is the bridge hub. Constantly busy, it offers its own microcosm of Harvard with well-dressed business students crossing to go towards Harvard Square in one direction and athletes coming from Harvard Yard going in the other direction, with the usual mix of tourists in between. If one can ignore the tight spaces and fences from construction, it’s even fun to take a picture on it. Perhaps the best thing about the Anderson Memorial Bridge is its use as the perfect location to take a picture of another bridge: the John W. Weeks Bridge. For now we’ll just have to wait until construction is completed another eon from now.

John W. Weeks Bridge
With its elegant red brick and white railing, it’s no wonder many find the John W. Weeks Bridge to be a romantic spot. This bridge seems to live up to everything people could expect from Harvard bridges. It offers several opportunities that Harvard’s other bridges do not. Daring people who wish to jump off it can take the chance without cars watching and claustrophobes who just need a wider bridge to cross than the Anderson Memorial Bridge can go ahead and take all the space they need. But beware: For those who wish to jump, chickening out means jumping onto the concrete. That definitely hurts more than water!

Harvard Bridge
Harvard Bridge must be Harvard’s most famous bridge if it bears that name, right? Wrong— Harvard Bridge is actually located at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It’s a mystery why MIT would have a bridge named after Harvard, but regardless of the story that determined that, it bears the Harvard name, so it really should be included in this list of Harvard’s bridges. The Harvard Bridge sits nestled between MIT and Boston and actually offers a nice location to ride a bike or sit and look at the collection of skyscrapers across Cambridge. It even has a cameo appearance in Robert Luketic’s 2008 movie, “21,” as a bicycle path. Is it technically not part of Harvard? Maybe, but home is where the heart is, and we’re sure Harvard Bridge has its heart at the school whose name it bears.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sara Melson ’90 is the very definition of talent. She danced ballet professionally after high school, before graduating from Harvard with an honors in English and pursuing acting in Los Angeles, where she landed roles in shows such as “Beverly Hills 90210,” “Frasier,” and “Murder She Wrote.” After releasing her debut album, “Dirty Mind,” in 2008, she rose to prominence in the music scene—her songs featured in shows like “Grey’s Anatomy” and the national Chevy commercial campaign. Melson will be releasing her soulful third LP, “Safe and Sound,” on Sept. 9, and in celebration of her new album release, she returned to Harvard Square to play at Club Passim this Sunday Sept. 4. Prior to her performance, Melson sat down with The Crimson to talk about her diverse artistic history, her Harvard experience, and her music.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you become a musician?
Sara Melson: I’ve actually been a little performer since I was really young, kind of like since the day I could remember being conscious. I’ve always loved singing and dancing…. And then, as I grew and I became a little bit older, I was in my first play, and from there, I caught the acting bug as well…. In terms of the songwriting aspect, that one came a little bit later…. Musically, I was playing piano; then, guitar, I didn’t start learning until college. Before that, it was just piano and singing and I didn’t even know how to incorporate my poems and my lyrics into songs yet…. It took longer for me to feel comfortable as a musician to actually get up in front of an audience and play a song.... There was an interim [period] after graduation that I didn’t feel ready for that. I felt like I needed more time to perfect it, and I’m still perfecting it. You know, I wanted it to be good. After graduation, I actually went into acting. I was an actress for, like, ten years…. Meanwhile, I had a band… and kind of, it started to take over. The music caught up to where I was. Coincidentally, with the acting, I was starting to feel a little bit limited by the types of roles that were being offered to girls at that time…. I was like, “How do I do make this into a career? I don’t want to be constantly playing some clichéd character.”…  I stepped out of [acting] to do music because I felt artistically I could found a lot more fulfillment and self-expression through music. I’m so glad I did that because I crafted a career in music that is invaluable—you can’t trade that.
THC: How did you begin playing guitar?
SM: I went on a lot of adventures during Harvard. I got out of town a lot. I went camping a lot. I went into New York a lot. I just explored the East Coast. The first guitar that I ever got was a gift—it was free. It was given to me by a homeless kid in Washington Square Park, who was adorable and had this guitar and was leaving town and didn’t know what to do with [the guitar] and didn’t want to cart around. It didn’t have any strings on it. I took it in the music repair shop in West Village and got it fixed, and that was my first guitar. It was a beautiful 12-string guitar…. What was liberating about it was that I had grown up playing classical piano. I didn’t know that you could just write a song from improv…. That opened up my piano composition dramatically. Learning how to write on guitar freed me up to write on piano. That was when the dam really opened. That was when I really started writing non-stop.
THC: What themes do you touch upon in your music?
SM: As you get older, your relationship with time changes dramatically…. It’s really profound because you start appreciating not only where you’ve come from… and not only the future… but [also] really the present moment. If you’re really lucky, you really learn how to stop to living in the past and the future, and your focus becomes fully living in the now. The practice of doing it is a whole other thing than reading about it and hearing about it…. You’re constantly reigning yourself back into the now. A lot of my material reflects on that. So themes of life, death, connection, love, inspiration, fulfillment—these things are more important than societal expectation, material reward, [and] living up to any kind of labels you think you have. But it takes forever to finally accept that. So the process of the journey of learning how to do that is fascinating for me.
THC: What was Harvard like for you?
SM: I was a very big overachiever in high school, and I kind of didn’t let myself have too much fun. And I have to admit that when I went to Harvard, I went that direction, pretty much fully. That’s not to say I didn’t do well and get good grades—I did. But I deliberately sought out the least demanding courses…. I wish in a way, looking back, that I had been a little bit more academically inclined… but you know what, I don’t like to ever say “woulda, shoulda, coulda” because I wouldn’t be who I am today if I hadn’t have had the type of experience that I exactly had. And I still got a lot out of it academically…. [My parents and I] were commenting on how the greatest skill that you could possibly develop is two-fold: your energetic communication with others—that’s the first thing—and your writing…. That I learned here, and I’m really grateful for that. And it’s the people that you meet here—they are like friends for life. That, you cannot trade that for everything.
THC: Your music has been used on national commercial campaigns and on television shows. You’ve been called a “New Buzz Artist” by Yahoo Music. What has it been like receiving this recognition?
SM: It’s really gratifying. The reason why I [make music] is to ultimately communicate with other people. And it starts out as a means to heal myself—the writing—and then it extends out to help out other people and soothe them in some way and inspire them in some way. Whenever I connect with anybody, it makes me feel so good. I feel like the music is doing its job.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ask someone to picture Harvard University and most responses will include red bricks, bell towers, and perhaps even a mention of colonial-style architecture from the more technical respondents. A number of Harvard buildings do conform to this style, from Lowell House with its bell tower to the beautiful red bricks all over Harvard Yard. There is, however, a notable exception. The Science Center, with its imposing gray facade and multiple tiers, may be Harvard’s eyesore, but it is also a highly frequented location. With the amount of people who are forced to visit it on a daily basis, it would be helpful to search for the most aesthetically pleasing places in the Science Center.
There’s little hope of finding anything aesthetically pleasing outside. In fact, there is likely no good angle at which to catch the Science Center. Built during a modernist architectural movement in the 1970s, it is no surprise the Science Center looks the way it does. However, that is of no consequence, as it is what’s on the inside that counts.
Perhaps the first site of interest is Cabot Science Library. Not the inside of the library of course (although it will be renovated this summer, so there is hope), as it looks like any other library, but the second floor of Cabot—specifically the large window that looks out onto the Science Center Plaza. A quiet study spot, Cabot’s second floor provides the perfect location to look up from hours of studying to see other people busily running from one place to another. The trees framing the scene, as well as the sight of Memorial Hall on the side, are picturesque. Of course, it is true that this location is technically not looking at any part of the Science Center at all, but it is within the building, so it should count.
Likewise, the Science Center offers another pleasing site at the Math Department lounge. With a view of the entire Yard, this terrace serves a dual purpose as a meeting place and as a great location for a nice photo. It happens to be quite popular with students, but that should not detract from its appeal as it has a view like no other. Going up there around sunset could even serve as a cheap date idea! Admittedly, this site is still not looking at any part of the Science Center, but that shouldn’t take away from the fact that it’s a nice location, right?
Finally, there is the wonderful astronomical observatory. It isn’t much of a study space if one isn’t an astrophysics concentrator, but it is perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of the Science Center. With its massive telescopes, it gives the opportunity to look out at the stars for a night. It really can’t get better than looking at the space beyond our tiny planet from the comfort of the Science Center.  Again, its beauty is derived from the fact that one is looking out at the galaxy beyond the building he or she is standing in, but perhaps that is the only appeal of the Science Center.
If there’s any broad conclusion to be made about the Science Center, it is that it is most appealing when one is looking at anything besides it.  With its beautiful surroundings, it’s best to take the opportunity to look at the campus around you and forget the gray, brutalist building actually encompassing one.  It may just be the only way to enjoy Harvard’s eyesore.

When Shirley Manson stood at the center of the stage with a shiny black leather dress, leopard-print stockings, and newly-dyed candy pink hair (somewhat reminiscent of Scarlett Johansson’s wig in “Lost in Translation”), it was clear that she was still the “it” girl of rock n’ roll, and one of the coolest rock stars overall. Together with the rest of Garbage, she presented a powerful, hit-packed, if somewhat over-the-top, performance at House of Blues on July 28.
The band started the concert with an immediately statement-making mix of bombastic guitar riffs and exhausting drumbeats, and the high energy level lasted the whole evening. Except for, surprisingly, the first verse of “Only Happy When It Rains,” every song was played at maximum volume, challenging the expressive power of the instruments, featuring often impassioned dialogues between the guitars. And Manson’s repressed roars-to-full-blown screams were so devoted that two-thirds through in the concert she had to borrow a hair band from an audience member as a result of being too sweaty.
Although in their 50s, the band members still managed to uphold their mantle as the “queerest of the queer.” The urgency in Garbage’s songs is explained by their ambition to give voice to a generation—a generation living underground, ignored by the mainstream, and comfortable with their label as “garbage.” For decades, Manson and her band were dedicated to justifying the existence of this alternative way of living, and when they sang “Sex is Not the Enemy,” it still had a manifesto-ish power fueled by revolutionary spirit.  In the middle of the concert, Manson gave a prolonged speech calling for society’s tolerance for any kind of love and sex as long as it was not nonconsensual or underage. Intentional or not, the song and the speech echoed with the United States Supreme Court’s jurisdiction that same-sex marriage is protected by the Constitution. It makes one ponder, once again, on the ingrained political and social trappings of the rock genre.
Another image that Garbage developed over the years with their music is that of a cool girl who keeps her feelings to herself and remains skeptical of love due to past trauma, and, at the concert in House of Blues, this side of Garbage made it into the setlist through songs like “Bleed Like Me” and “Stupid Girl.” However, these songs were mostly rendered with the indiscriminately energetic guitar riffs and furious drumbeats that characterized the concert’s sound. While this might just have been a choice made for the particular atmosphere of a live concert, the chaotic sound embraced by the band unfortunately overshadowed the fragility, sensitivity, and bitterness of Manson’s vocals — one of the most unique and precious treasures of Garbage. Their portrait of a rock girl both longing for love and scared of love is one that is still very relevant today, and can still be found in many popular personalities, both real and fictional, in our world (think Lisbeth Salander in “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.”)
In fact, it is dubious whether Garbage’s whole effort of being a rock ‘n’ roll powerhouse was effective. After all, they have never been famous for their instrumentals. No matter how thick their basslines or how resounding their guitar solos, they were still clearly no AC/DC. And they shouldn’t be—the charm of Garbage is not in the kind of running-around-the-stage-half-naked energy they chose for the concert, but in the whatever-I-don’t-care understatement that permeates their work, and it is important for them to keep expanding this persona that made them who they are. After all, they are “not your kind of people.” At the concert, a gesture Manson made repeatedly—putting her hands in the pockets of her dress, checking on the audience—actually served as a perfect counterpoint to running around the stage, and the poppiness of their studio albums is a great match of this image. However, at least at the House of Blues, Manson and her band seemed to be leaning a bit too far on the heavy rock side.
Almost a year ago, Garbage held a concert in Chicago where the setlist drew almost exclusively from their debut album, and it was stunning how edgy and stylish its 1995 materials sounded twenty years later. Garbage is cool. They have always been this way, and it has never been necessary for them to try to prove it with numbing instrumentals. After all, the moment when you try to be cool, you stop being cool.

On April 29, Boston Lyric Opera premiered their production of Franz Lehár’s 1905 opera “The Merry Widow,” which ran through May 8. BLO’s adaptation changes the setting from the Belle Epoque to the days leading up to WWI. This device, combined with a strong cast and brilliant set design and lighting, resulted in a spirited, sharp-witted opera that was a pleasure to watch.
Set against the looming specter of the war, the story of “The Merry Widow” begins when the recently widowed Hanna Glawari returns to the Pontevedrian embassy in Paris, her husband’s countrymen determined that they should inherit her fortune of 20 million dollars. While there is no dearth of suitors, it is quickly apparent that Hanna and the womanizing Count Danilo have a complicated history. Amid the romantic intrigues of court—“There’s nothing like a whiff of adultery to brighten things up,” says Baron Zeta—Hanna and Danilo channel Shakespeare’s Beatrice and Benedick, attacking one another sometimes with their words, but more often with their dances: a lively mazurka, a seductive waltz, even a traditional Balkan jig. The territorial wars of the ballroom floor are mirrored by the political turmoil of the outer world.
That the opera succeeded in portraying war in terms of ballroom dances was a testament to the champagne-clouded judgment of the upper classes, who see their own personal dramas as more important than the brewing political storm. A telegram informing Baron Zeta that Franz Ferdinand has arrived in Sarajevo was quickly torn up, with an angry shout of “I have important matters of state to attend to!” For the moment, it was true: The world of forbidden fruits and lavish balls was infinitely more interesting than the dull politics of the outer world, but as Hanna and Danilo’s relationship progressed, the war loomed ever closer, and the almost ditzy bravado of the opening chorale was replaced by somber arias and seductively sinister can-can numbers.
Despite its serious setting, this opera never succumbs to doom-and-gloom or melodrama. Quick, witty comedy was plentiful, as were jabs about Hanna’s Americanness. In one particularly funnyd number, the men sang about how women mercilessly wage war on their hearts. Upon realizing that the women had been watching this entire time, the men scattered like mice—their desperation a perfect distraction from the drama to come.
The set design was another brilliant work of art, creating a stage that almost upstaged the performers. John Conklin’s stage design—Art Deco extravagance arrayed in jewel tones and deep azures—was beautifully melancholic, imbuing every ball scene with nostalgia. Robert Wierzel’s lighting design furthered the drama, often serving as an emotional complement to the acting. The work of these artists came together for a design climax at Maxim’s nightclub, where golden lighting shifted to one of deep amber, highlighting the sweeping curves of the Belle Epoque nudes. As the mood turned sultry, the color changed to a dangerous love-potion pink. While the scene at Maxim’s is home to one of the opera’s most iconic dance numbers, the lighting and set stole the stage. But in the final scene of the opera, when the lavishness was laid bare by the beginning of the war, the set was sparse, grey, almost naked. Soldiers hummed the opera’s “Widow Waltz” without accompaniment, making for a moment of stark contrast between the lavish opening number and the inevitable tragedy of the future.
Of course, there were also moments of weakness in “The Merry Widow”—most prominent of which was Roger Honeywell’s (Count Danilo) voice, which sounded strained and brittle in contrast to Erin Wall’s (Hanna Glawari) supple soprano. Additionally, some comedic moments, like a phallic drawing on one of the maps, felt ill-timed or overdone, causing the opera to briefly lose its balance between seductive and vulgar. However, these missteps were rare, and the show emerged largely unscathed. The strength of the ensemble, combined with well-executed music and a truly unique set design, created an opera that was a truly fruitful reimagination of the original.

When I first picked up “War and Peace” by Leo Tolstoy, I never expected the surprise I was about to receive. I knew it was considered an excellent classic novel, but I also expected it to be full of boring, dense paragraphs that I would be unable to understand unless I were suddenly to become philosophically inclined. However, by the time I reached the end of this novel, I had to pause and reflect on the masterpiece I had just finished. While “War and Peace” tells the story of five families in the Russian nobility in Moscow and St. Petersburg during the Napoleonic Wars, it is not just the story of a specific set of characters in a specific period of time at a specific place.  Rather, “War and Peace” is the story of what it is to be human. It is the story of humanity’s many tragedies, joys, anxieties, dreams, and questions.  Chronicling the human experience is no small feat, but Leo Tolstoy achieves this lofty goal in a book full of meaning, emotion, and beauty as its characters search for truth in a confusing world.
While “War and Peace” addresses weighty subjects, it begins slowly, patiently introducing its many characters. They are mostly from five noble families: the Bolkonsky family, whose central characters are Andrei and Marya; the Rostov family, whose central characters are Natasha and Nicolas; the Bezukhov family, whose main character is Pierre; the Kuragin family, whose main characters are Vasily, Ellen, and Anatole; and the Drubetskoy family, whose only two members are Anna and her son, Boris. Over the span of seven years, from the beginning of the Napoleonic Wars in 1805 to Napoleon’s final defeat in 1812, the book catalogues both Russia’s evolution as the war eventually comes to its front and the families’ evolution as their members grow both in age and experience. Andrei Bolkonsky, Nicolas Rostov, and Boris Drubetskoy offer one kind of perspective, as they initially seem to relish the activity and excitement of going off to war and eventually have to come to terms with the horrors of being surrounded by death. However, “War and Peace” is so familiar because it also tells the stories of characters left at home such as Natasha Rostov and Pierre Bezuhov, who are left to navigate a different kind of difficulty as they face social stigmas, betrayals, and the unknown fate of their loved ones. The toll of these different kinds of difficulties eventually become clear through the eyes of Andrei Bolkonsky and Pierre Bezuhov, who both question the meaning of life and search for answers in very different places as the novel progresses.
With such a large set of characters, to come up with a quick summary of the novel is difficult, as each character faces distinct trials and questions.  Perhaps the best way to characterize “War and Peace” would be to describe it as a novel of duality.  Just as it shows the duality between war and peace—two contradictory concepts that can exist simultaneously—the whole novel depicts the comparison between good and evil, beauty and ugliness, and life and death, and characters such as Andrei and Pierre, Natasha and Ellen, and the Emperor Alexander and Napoleon Bonaparte. The fact that two different things can be simultaneously present, such as the fact that Ellen is considered beautiful despite her cruel heart or that Pierre, who by nature is kind and helpless, can be considered to live an dissipated lifestyle by his contemporaries, is descriptive of both Russian society and reality despite the human tendency to try to simplify the complexities of life. By acknowledging the complexities, only then can we begin to see the truth, as the novel seems to indicate.
While Tolstoy’s style may help to make this novel revelatory, the aspect that elevates “War and Peace” to greatness is the fact that it is a novel about universal love. Often viewed as a conventional love story due to its many romances and marriages, “War and Peace” searches for something much deeper: A kind of love that eclipses and includes all kinds of love. As Andrei or Pierre begin to face death all around them, they serve as the vessels for this search as they refuse to accept that life has no meaning but ultimately find meaning in a transcendent love. Thus, we see Prince Andrei never truly come to life until he has that love close to the point of death, and Pierre’s life begin when he realizes this as well.  The novel shows that accepting this idea of universal love is the ultimate path to peace and greatness, much better to attain in everyday life than the greatness Napoleon was trying to gain through war.
Love, life, and death are all seemingly intertwined in a special way in this novel, and while I felt the losses heavily, I can acknowledge the beauty found in the love revealed by these losses. The matters Tolstoy addresses on life’s meaning and purpose are a part of everyday life, and reading this novel forced me to truly think about my own perspective on these deeper questions. “War and Peace” is a deep, complex, and even tragic novel, but it offers hope and a promising message in spite of all the losses, just as one would hope to have in life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Your Relationship GPA: Lessons from Harvard Students on How to Make Time for What Matters Most,”wears many hats. The book by Gregory M. Foster ’17 and Stephen A. Turban ’17 manages simultaneously to be an extensive research paper, a series of Harvard Business School-like case studies, a compilation of personal essays, and a synthesis of important interpersonal—if obvious—life lessons. The blend of voices and styles ultimately drives home those lessons, albeit repetitively.
Geared toward students attending or about to attend college, the book lays out a systematic approach for navigating college’s manifold relationships: peer-to-peer, professor-to-student, and parents-to-burgeoning young adult. While the book is extremely clear and concise with easy-to-follow chapter headings including “Take Initiative,” “Listen Well,” and “Give Often,” it is hardly revelatory. It makes sense that students must learn to prioritize making and developing meaningful connections in certain areas of their lives. Seeking out professional and/or personal mentors also seems an inarguably good idea. Similarly, it is difficult to dispute the advice provided to strike a balance between honing new relationships and keeping in touch with family and lifelong friends.
The book’s ability to tackle such outwardly apparent topics with flair and spunk makes the text not just informative but also engaging. “Wherever you’re heading, whoever you are, however old you are, you can always reorient yourself,” Foster and Turban write. “Relationship skills are an investment; the sooner you start investing, the better off you’ll be.” The book ultimately treats such sensible points with candor and convivial banter (with a few too many references to cheesecake that fail to deliver any coherent punchline), and yet it often ascribes epiphany status to seemingly logical suggestions.
The book does benefit from Foster’s and Turban’s status as Harvard students. The two use that niche to contrast the often competitive (perhaps, especially at Harvard) academic “Grade Point Average” with the “Relationship Grade Point Average,” which, they argue, has a greater impact on happiness and personal fulfillment in the end. The characteristically compelling introduction from Dean of Freshman Thomas A. Dingman ’67 aside, the book uses Harvard examples and case studies which readers easily can extrapolate to fit relationships forged at their colleges, workplaces, or, really, anywhere. Again, it all makes so much sense, and Turban and Foster have capitalized on this heretofore untapped, in-plain-sight power.
The strength of “Your Relationship GPA” lies in the relatable anecdotes that Foster and Turban collected during interviews with Harvard students. Indeed, more of these personal, telling stories would have rounded out the heavily footnoted case studies and secondary source material, which resulted in the bulk of the text reading like a comprehensive psychology paper. The blend of the personal and the scholarly worked fairly well to bolster the authors’ overarching point—that honing a network of friendships, mentorships, and even romances in college ultimately leads to a more fruitful life after graduation—although switching between the two styles at times felt disorienting. Overall, though, the book follows through on the promise it outlines: sharing the tips and tricks of the trade for focusing on interpersonal development in college.

As students in the various Harvard Graduate Schools, we celebrate the recent NLRB decision, which restored the right of student employees at private universities to unionize. The ruling will positively impact a wide range of student workers. Many in the Harvard community may not know that Harvard grants several research doctorates in addition to the traditional PhD from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS). Many of these non-PhD doctoral programs are being replaced with traditional PhDs, but for at least the next five to seven years, there will still be hundreds of non-PhD doctoral students, including Doctors of Theology (ThDs) at the Divinity School, Doctors of Education (EdDs) at the School of Education, and Doctors of Science (ScDs) at the T. H. Chan School of Public Health. These programs each offer their own support packages to incoming students, resulting in a piecemeal approach to providing financial and social support that breeds substantial inequities among the roughly 4,000 doctoral students on campus. Forming a union that comprises all graduate workers (TAs, TFs, RAs) across programs will enable students to bargain collectively for policies that support all doctoral students in their roles as teachers and researchers.
Starting last fall, our unionization efforts here drew attention to the importance of family friendly policies to make Harvard a more inclusive and just university. Soon after our union gained majority support last December, the Harvard administration gave out improvements to the GSAS students, a clear response to unionization. While we celebrated these improvements, they did not apply to non-PhD doctoral students. Although some improvements for ThDs, EdDs, and ScDs have been announced since then, disparities remain. ScD students have been promised tuition and health insurance coverage, but still do not receive any type of systematic stipends. In addition, the brand new GSAS enhancements only apply to selected humanities and social science departments. With a union, we will have a voice to make sure no one slips through the cracks.
These discrepancies exist not just for benefits, but also with the more basic aspects of graduate student finances. PhD students receive a funding package that typically includes 2-3 years of a stipend, 2 years of guaranteed TF and RA positions, and 5 years of tuition, fees, and health care coverage. At the T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in contrast, some ScD students have had to pay full tuition, in addition to receiving no stipend and paying for health insurance out of pocket. To make matters worse, the TA pay-rate is substantially lower than that of others schools. As a teaching assistant to a standard, quarter-long class in Global Health and Population, one of us was paid just $875 dollars (total, not per month).
Further examples abound, across departments and schools. Some PhDs in GSAS were paid a quarter the standard teaching fellowship for courses taught in other departments; this varies from department to department, and there is no standardization of pay. After paying tuition and fees, students often can only break even financially. A few of us have turned to state-funded health insurance policies for spouses and children because it is prohibitively expensive to add dependents onto Harvard’s health insurance; these services provide the bare minimum while still demanding out-of-pocket expenses. Some are on SNAP benefits, commonly known as food stamps, and are offered no ongoing, monthly financial assistance for child support (unlike at other, unionized universities).
At the School of Education, there is a large disparity between the support offered to EdD candidates and those pursuing a PhD. While parental leave and health care benefits were expanded over this past summer, likely due to our unionization efforts, EdD students are guaranteed a much smaller stipend, only available during their first year. Additionally, while compensation for TFing and RAing is similar to what is offered by GSAS, the expectations that professors have of TFs and RAs vary widely. Some courses require much more work of TFs than others. Some researchers allow RAs to coauthor papers, while others insist that authored work be done without pay. With a union and a real seat at the table, graduate workers will have the ability to hold administrators accountable to clear policies.
In order to meet our basic needs, many of us end up prioritizing external consultancies and other outside jobs unrelated to our research. Predictably, this greatly reduces the time and attention we can devote to our coursework and dissertation research, and runs contrary to the entire purpose of our programs. Meanwhile, the benefits offered to PhDs seem like pipe dreams to those of us toiling without so much as a basic living stipend.
Forming a university-wide graduate employee union is a concrete and constructive act of solidarity among all students who perform important work for Harvard University. Instead of working on an individual basis, TFs, TAs, and RAs could collectively bargain over important issues, from teaching compensation to spousal health insurance benefits. Currently, all policy decisions are made unilaterally by the administration; a union would give us a voice in shaping the conditions of our work. A union can negotiate better contracts for all workers without “leveling down” the conditions of some, or without disrupting the relationship between advisors and students—both common misconceptions about how grad unions function. We want to be part of a community that looks after the interest of each and every one of us, not just the ones who happen to get lucky or come from more privileged backgrounds. Forming a union of graduate workers from across the University is the only way to obtain just benefits that offer equal opportunity to all.

Joseph C. McIntyre is an EdD Candidate in Education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Leigh G. Senderowicz is an ScD Candidate in Global Health and Population at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Axel Marc Oaks Takács is a ThD Candidate in the Study of Religion at Harvard Divinity School.

UPDATED: September 8, 2016, at 10:31 p.m.
Close necklines with open shoulders makes a person look skinnier. So does the color black and flared skirts. The employee at the department store was insistent that these were the only elements I try on, discarding every other dress I had taken off the racks. Wanting to be nice, I reluctantly put on the black lace design she advocated.
“Oh! That looks great,” she sung (for just a second), “But I am sorry for recommending that. It’s too skin-tight. See how it shows off your belly. (Pat, pat. Trespassed personal bubble. And then the next dress: pink rose-pattern.) Ah, this pink one is so much better. The flare hides your figure perfectly and it even has the right neckline. You look so skinny and beautiful now!”
It was like she was trying to make each comment weight-related. I hated this “service,” but she was too friendly and helpful, and I was less insulted than I was confused. Considering how hard she was trying to make me look my best, I thought that perhaps she just didn’t realize I disagreed with her criticism of my figure. But to my smiling, somewhat aggressive assertion that I looked perfectly attractive, she laughed:
“Sure, sure. In America, they like girls with more fat, right? That must be the fashion. But Chinese girls are supposed to be skinny―flat belly and long legs. Don’t worry about not being able to do it. You can lose the weight too! Trust me. I lost 40 pounds when I was your age.”
. . .
The standards of slimness in China are far more impossible and overtly insistent than anything the U.S. advocates. Even without the constant commentary of shopkeepers, relatives, and occasional taxi drivers, the point is clearly made by the options provided. Small, medium, and large are linguistic terms of comparison. But in many of Shanghai’s clothing stores, small is often the only size offered, with the occasional medium serving as an accommodation for obesity. Out of all the shops I’ve walked through, I’ve found only one store with sizes greater than medium: a silk establishment targeting late middle-aged women. My silk-infatuated aunt had taken me there, insisting that I buy a dress too. Finding an acceptably minimalist style amongst the heavy patterns, I decided it was worth the odd obligation. Except the first size she chose for me was an XXXL.
What I love most about how Chinese people discuss weight is the way they bluntly discuss your prospects for marriage in the same breath. I once had a friend from China explain to me that the reason why she’s never dated before is because her legs aren’t skinny enough―as though that ought to be the only criteria for a close relationship. When it comes to explaining your attractiveness, China couldn’t care less about how you feel about yourself. No matter how perfectly self-confident you are, at the end of the day, your relatives still firmly believe that you will die alone―unless you’re lucky enough to find leftovers.
From an American perspective, this complete dismissal of the individual and the importance of self-confidence make no sense. Most of America’s body-positivity movements are focused on the consequences that have nothing to do with personal relationships. Anorexia, Bulimia, and Binge-eating are all eating disorders that can seriously threaten health. Social isolation, depression, and even suicide are the too often results of a less-than-perfect figure. And at the base of all these issues is the loss of self-love.
But while targeting self-esteem is useful, in many ways it ignores a fundamental need for social approval. The Emerson-style individual who can stand above the masses in radiant confidence is a beautiful American invention, but it isn’t fair to the person who will have to live with the very real social consequences of an “imperfect” body. My random commentators in China were unfortunately right to worry about how my perfect BMI would affect my social and romantic attractiveness. They were only wrong about where they drew the line for beautiful.
If real change is to be made against the social discrimination towards non-models, it cannot simply be about accepting yourself. It must also be about expecting acceptance from others. I can still remember how confused and irritated my friends were when they received a “Don’t worry about your body. You look beautiful!” message on their desk in the library. Perhaps a more effective message would have been “I think you are beautiful. Let others know that you think they are beautiful, too.” And perhaps, I could learn to be less adamant about myself towards critical department store employees. Instead, I should have turned the lenses of judgment onto her:
She was perfect too.

Sex toys are only loosely related to safety, but at the University of Texas, they have become instruments of protest against state legislation forcing public campuses to accept concealed carry of handguns. The legislation took effect on Aug. 1, the 50th anniversary of UT Austin's clock tower massacre, one of America’s deadliest mass shootings.
The law’s supporters take the stance that concealed carry is a part of their Second Amendment rights. But if gun proponents truly want to maximize safety, measures other than the further proliferation of arms should be sought out. Put bluntly, making college students in the tumultuous years between late adolescence and full-fledged adulthood the first line of defense for Texas' most esteemed public institutions is a questionable means of making the state's campuses safer.
Neurology confirms college students’ dubious decision-making abilities. The frontal lobes, the area of the brain responsible for ultimate decision-making, may not even fully develop until the 30s, and one of the last areas to mature. While this lagged development should not exempt college students from all responsibilities, Texas ought to reconsider the prudence of relying on gun-toting  20-somethings for campus safety.
The environment of undergraduate life itself also gives ample reason to question the wisdom of concealed carry. Alcohol and drugs are undeniable parts of college life, and combined with unfinished brain development these mind-altering substances could easily lead to accidents. Without painting with too broad a brush, these concerns are likely even more significant at a school with a strong Greek Life that is known for having trespassed boundaries. Three Greek Organizations at the Arlington campus will be newly returning from suspension this fall for hazing and other issues. There is valid reason to fear that the influences of alcohol, drugs, and intense social groups combined with guns could easily lead to accidents or purposeful shootings.
The legislation’s most corrosive effects, however, will manifest themselves in the domain of academic freedom. Teachers are not allowed to ask if their students have guns in the classroom, nor are they not allowed to prohibit them, undercutting their control over their learning environment. Professors have been reconsidering how they teach their classes, debating whether they should make them less confrontational or eschew certain topics altogether. College classrooms are often filled with intense and oftentimes adversarial debates, so it is unsurprising that many students are fearful  of the presence of guns. This caution will have an especially scarring effect on classes related to gender studies, racism, socioeconomics, and social sciences in general.
If college campuses are to remain the intellectually free and challenging sanctums they are meant to be, guns have no place. Safety should remain he responsibility of the university and the police force, and not the prerogative of 21-year-olds.

Fans of burger restaurant b.good can breathe a sigh of relief as the chain returns to Harvard Square later this month, following a five-month closure.
The health-focused fast food eatery, which will move into the former home of Japanese restaurant O Sushi,  closed its location on Dunster St. last spring because of renovations of the Smith Campus Center slated to last until 2018.
O Sushi, which had been in the Square at 1 Eliot St. since 2012, recently closed its doors. Since then, b.good put up a sign inviting prospective employees to apply.
According to  b.good co-founder Anthony S. Ackil ’99, the new storefront is going to be “more bright and inviting” than the company's former  location on Dunster Street.
“Our first Harvard location was our second b.good location,” Ackil said. “Since then, we have evolved the look and feel of our restaurants.”
Ackil said b.good will also unveil a new menu at the grand opening of the storefront.
“We are rolling out a new menu at all our locations but it will be unveiled first at the new Harvard Square location,” Ackil said. “It’s a secret, but it’s awesome.”
Karen P. Reyes ’19, who described herself as a frequent b.good patron, is looking forward to the new restaurant’s opening.
“B.good was a place where my roommate and I always went when we weren't feeling the food in the d-hall, so we were pretty devastated when we found out it was closing,” she said. “To hear that the chain is returning to the Square actually made my day.”
And Reyes said the new menu will only add to the buzz around the new location.
“I'm excited to see what b.good comes up with,” she said. “I was a fan of most items on their menu, so a secret menu adds excitement to the return of one of my favorite spots in the Square.”
In March, Ackil said said the company hoped to find a new location in Harvard Square, but acknowledged finding a new location was difficult because of high rent prices in the area.
“It’s very difficult right now because there’s so many people looking in the Square,”  Ackil said this month. “There are a lot of national tenants and they pay a lot more than smaller local companies like us.”

The Financial Aid Office updated its student budgeting app, Shoestring Strategies for Life @ Harvard, to include a centralized calendar and section on health and wellness in a bid to further support students once they matriculate.
The Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, which recruits and supports students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, first released a printed version of the guide in 2005 and in 2014 unveiled a mobile app version. The app is divided into categories related to academics, personal finance, jobs, events, and health.
The new health and wellness section includes information on mental health resources, local recreational activities, and listings for wellness classes. The Financial Aid Initiative created that section because of increased campus focus on mental and physical health, according Michael P. Richard ’17, an HFAI student coordinator who has worked on the app since 2014.
The app’s update also includes a centralized calendar that continuously compiles sporting, arts, advising, and student club events. Richard said he hopes the app will help incoming and current students navigate University resources, and take advantage of local deals and discounts.
HFAI student coordinator Sophie T. Carroll ’17 said the app is intended to increase connection and support between the Financial Aid Office and students on campus.
“As the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, in addition to our normal recruiting of high school students and students to come to the University, we also want to focus on supporting students from low socio-economic backgrounds once they’re on campus,” she said.
Mike Esposito, director of HFAI and assistant director of Financial Aid, said the updated app is “something that students can take with them in their pocket on the go, and be a lot more convenient and usable for most people living in the 21st century.”
The Initiative’s student coordinators developed the content, media, and design of the app and will continue to maintain it. An outside development company, Modo Labs, provided the app’s template.
HFAI will continue updating the app’s content throughout the year and is working on enabling push notifications to alert students to impromptu events and giveaways happening on campus, Esposito said.
HFAI is still working to appeal to current students, as oppose to just incoming freshmen, Richard and Carroll said. Richard said he hopes the app can ultimately spread beyond Harvard to other universities.
“I would love to see this featured, for example, at the Ivy Gen conference or across admissions presentations to inspire our peers to want to take on something like this,” he said.  “At the end of the day we don’t want just to have Harvard be better and more financially accessible, but we want colleges across the country to be so [accessible], especially at other places that don’t have as robust support systems as Harvard does."
Shoestring Strategies is free and currently available to download through both the Apple and Android app stores.

For the first time in the publication’s nearly 130-year history, the Harvard Law Review inducted a group of editors this year whose demographics reflect those of their wider Law School class—including the highest-ever percentages of women and students of color.
The demographic composition of the new editors—who were selected over the summer—reflects the broader makeup of the  Law School’s class of 2018, according to numbers provided by Harvard Law Review President Michael L. Zuckerman ’10. Forty-six percent of the incoming editors are women, an increase of about 10 percentage points from an average of the past three years. Forty-one percent are students of color, compared to the same three-year average of 28 percent on the Law Review. Both roughly reflect the corresponding breakdown of the wider Law School class.
The Law Review includes 46 editors from each second-year and third-year class, for a total of 92. 
The Harvard Law Review—one of the preeminent student organizations at the school—has faced criticism in recent years for lacking representation of women and minorities on its editorial staff. A report released last spring by the Women’s Law Association’s Shatter the Ceiling Committee highlighted the gender gap in Law Review membership. That gender disparity has persisted even after the Law Review expanded an affirmative action policy to include gender in 2013, in its editor selection process.
Debate over diversity and inclusion across the broader Law School shaped campus dialogue last year, when student activists with the group Reclaim Harvard Law drew national attention to the issue.
“The descriptive stats of the Review haven’t historically been inclusive and so that may signal to some people that it’s not an inclusive place, because it didn’t have an inclusive membership,” said Imelme Umana, a second-year Law student and new Law Review editor. “One of the best ways to signal inclusion is to, in fact, diversify the membership.”
Zuckerman said he thought the “grueling” seven-day competition process to get selected as an editor, combined with misconceptions about the type of person the Law Review attracts, deterred many women and students of color from completing the process in the past.
“That’s the kind of thing that we all want to make sure isn’t happening to someone—that they have this sense that their work is not going to be good enough and they’re not going to belong on the Law Review,” Zuckerman said.
When new leaders took over in January, they focused on recruitment and outreach efforts to challenge these perceptions and encourage first-year Law students to undergo the selection process. Last spring, editors led a recruitment process more focused on individuals. Their efforts included information sessions with affinity groups—such as the Black Law Students Association—and unique emails sent to every first-year student, and more than 200 one-on-one coffee chats to build relationships with prospective members and address their concerns.
For Umana, who is part of the Black Law Students Association, the individual coffee chats and the information session helped to demystify the publication and its selection process.
Law Review Vice President Kaitlin J. Beach, who said she has felt frustrated in the past as a female editor, added she thinks the new class’s diversity is already shifting discussions and priorities at the Law Review.
“We do everything democratically. We vote on every piece we choose to publish, and every change to the institution itself, so just getting different voices, different experiences from different life backgrounds I think has brought a lot of change to the table,” she said.
But Zuckerman is wary of hailing the demographic changes as a major victory, citing the development instead as one positive—and overdue—step toward creating an inclusive environment.
Umana shares this cautious optimism.
“It’s hard to say definitively that a diverse membership automatically leads to students of color feeling included,” she said. “I do hope that with the marked increase in the diversity of the membership, that it signals to future students of all sorts of marginalized identities that they belong at the Law Review.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During its first meeting of the semester, the Undergraduate Council unanimously passed an interim budget for the 2016-2017 academic year, allocating more than $500,000 to various Council committees and initiatives including the new Grant for an Open Harvard College.
The new budget—a total similar to last year—sets aside $15,000 for the grant, which is a program established last spring by UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 and UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17. The grant funds campus initiatives that focus on one or more of the Council’s four “compelling interests”: mental health, race relations, sexual assault and harassment, and social spaces.
The Student Initiatives Fund, which was used to fund several campus events last year, will receive $10,000 this year under the interim budget, down from $15,000 last year. Meanwhile, the Student Relations Fund, which is used for publicity campaigns and for connecting the Council with the student body at large, will receive $1,500 this year, down from $5,100 last year.
UC Treasurer Samarth Gupta ’18 said the funding cuts were necessary because last year’s UC budget allocations depended upon unused rollover funding from previous years. Gupta called this funding source “unsustainable,” because future Councils may not always receive the same amount in rollover funding.
For the first time, the Council also officially allocated $25,000 to an “Emergency Fund.” Gupta said the fund was meant for unexpected situations for which the Council might need funding.
Similar to last year’s budget, this year’s budget allocates $325,000 for grants to student organizations given out by the UC’s Finance Committee, as well as $10,000 for the UC’s Freshman Class Committee.
During the meeting, Rather and Banks emphasized their fall semester plans to focus on addressing concerns about campus social life. Rather said several of the UC initiatives put in place last year—including April’s pre-Yardfest neighborhood block parties—will become “consistent yearly event[s] under the domain of the College.”
Rather and Banks also praised the second installment of the Council’s Club 1636 initiative to host events geared at providing alternative social spaces for undergraduates. The most recent event took place Sunday night at Felipe’s Taqueria in Harvard Square.
“We had between 650 and 700 people come to Felipe’s,” Banks said. “You saw people from all across the College… come to the event.”
During the meeting, Rather noted that the declaration period for undergraduates to apply to run for open seats on the UC begins Tuesday, while the campaigning and voting period will begin on Sept. 12.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At least three students believe their cell phones were stolen at the same party on Saturday evening, held in Adams’ Senior House.
Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano said there is an “open and ongoing investigation” into an incident that took place in Claverly Hall on Saturday, but declined to comment further. Senior House is located next to Claverly.
Dominique J. Erney ’19 said she could feel her phone being lifted out of her pocket as she left the building into the crowded outdoors, but could not identify who took it. She said she filed a police report the following morning.
Another attendee, Alina Crouch ’19, said she believes someone may have grabbed her phone through a window while she was in the building.
“I didn't realize there wasn't any netting on the window so someone could just stick their arm through, but I thought it was safe,” Crouch said. “We were near the couches, no one was behind us. No one could have gotten in between us and gotten the phone—it had to have come from outside.”
Since the disappearances, Crouch said her credit card and multiple forms of identification, which were with her phone at the time of its disappearance, were found the next day in a mailbox outside where the party was held.
This April, a series of petty thefts in the River Houses spurred the Undergraduate Council’s Student Life Committee to issue a memo expressing support for exterior security cameras outside of College dormitories.
A party invitation was sent out by someone who identified himself as an Institute of Politics Social Chair, and the invitation featured an old photo of now-Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump and now-Democratic nominee Hillary R. Clinton standing together.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just under half of respondents to a recent Harvard University Dining Services survey indicated they were either “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with dining hall menu variety and the food taste.
The semesterly survey, which featured 1,736 respondents this spring, or about a quarter of Harvard’s undergraduate population, sheds light on student satisfaction with the dining provider on a number of components, including friendliness of staff, cleanliness, and grill service. Approximately 94 percent of survey respondents were undergraduates, and the remainder included residential tutors who frequent campus dining halls.
Overall, about 67 percent of respondents said they were "satisfied" or "very satisfied" with their HUDS experience.

Of the survey questions that focused on the food more generally, respondents gave their lowest ratings to menu variety. Around 27 percent of the respondents said they were either “dissatisfied” or “very dissatisfied” with the breadth of options in their dining halls. A plurality were satisfied, and 27 percent had no opinion.
Food taste had the second lowest rating when it came to general food questions—about 23 percent said they were “dissatisfied” or “very dissatisfied” with the taste of their dining hall meals. Forty-four percent said they were satisfied with taste.
According to HUDS spokesperson Crista Martin, the data indicates that the student body “sometimes has diametrically opposed tastes” when it comes to continuity of favorites and variety of new options. Students want dining halls to serve meals they are familiar with as well as encourage culinary exploration, Martin added, while HUDS must consider how to satisfy everyone.
“I think we have an incredibly diverse population, and they’re coming from all kinds of experience around food,” Martin said in a interview over the summer. But she noted that “people often have a misconception that because there is something they don't like, something that they don't eat, that means no one else does.”
Despite some dissatisfaction with food, students are “overwhelmingly” appreciative of dining workers, according to Martin.
Staff friendliness, appearance of staff, and speed of service were all given high satisfaction ratings. About 67 percent of respondents said they were “very satisfied” with staff friendliness, compared to 4.5 percent who felt the same about the taste of HUDS meals.
HUDS also polled students on their dining habits. Nearly three-quarters of respondents said they are occasionally vegetarian, with about 10 percent saying all their meals are meatless.
Students were also asked by HUDS how much time they have for lunch on a typical weekday. About 15 percent of respondents reported they have less than 20 minutes or less time for lunch, with 3.7 percent reporting no break for lunch. About a third of respondents reporting having more than 40 minutes to eat.
The survey also asked students about their cooking ability. Nearly 14 percent of respondents said they do not know how to cook, although most of those clueless cooks indicated they were interested in learning. By contrast, more than 37 percent of respondents said they “love to cook.”
HUDS also assessed how students access dining hall information by asking about the use of Omni, a mobile application rolled out by the Undergraduate Council last year. Of the students surveyed, about 25 percent reported they used Omni regularly in order to access dining information or order a bag meal, while more than 30 percent did not know what Omni was.
In addition to the survey, Martin said in an interview HUDS gathered consumption data based on the amount of food students eat at every meal. Over the summer, HUDS used survey data from the past academic year in addition to consumption data to craft new recipes and address student concerns.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Louisville and Harvard women’s soccer teams both entered Sunday’s matchup having built a habit of scoring early in games. In their first five games, the Cardinals had scored a total of three goals inside the first 15 minutes, while the Crimson had scored two goals in the same time frame in its first three games.
With the two teams both clearly able to start fast, there was always bound to be a goal early in their contest.
And on this night, it was Louisville that made the quick breakthrough in front of its home fans at Lynn Stadium. Freshman forward Brooklynn Rivers scored with the Cardinals’ first shot of the game in the 4th minute, and added a second in the 14th minute before Harvard could regroup.
Louisville never relinquished its lead, and went on to win, 3-1, without much drama. The Cardinals (4-1-1, 0-0-0 ACC) look to build another win streak as they continue their homestand against Ball State on Friday. The Crimson (2-2-0, 0-0-0 Ivy), meanwhile, will be tested with three more away games in the span of a week.
Before Rivers tilted the game in favor of Louisville, Harvard looked more likely to take the lead. Senior forward and leading goalscorer Midge Purce hit the crossbar with a long shot right after the kick-off, and junior midfielder Dani Stollar also forced Cardinals senior goalkeeper Taylor Bucklin into a save shortly after.
As the Crimson continued to press, however, Louisville caught its opponents on the counterattack and capitalized. Rivers collected the ball from a long pass into the box, and after holding off Harvard senior defender Bailey Gary, spun left and shot into the far right corner.
“We started off with more energy, and that’s what we wanted to do early in the game,” Crimson coach Chris Hamblin said. “They did well with their first counterattack, but that’s part of the game. The thing I was really disappointed with was how we reacted.”
Harvard seemed to lose its edge on the attack after the early blow, and soon paid for it when Rivers scored again. Once again on the counterattack, Cardinals sophomore forward Jill Vetere found Rivers with a through ball and she placed it into the right corner with an acrobatic left-footed shot.
“I think the biggest thing to take away is not what happened, but how our team reacted after,” said Crimson captain and midfielder Carly Rotatori. “We’ve done a great job so far this season about exhibiting high energy, and that’s what we need to focus on as we continue non-conference play.”
Harvard finally responded with a bit of its own magic in the 33rd minute, through a great solo effort by Purce. After Rotatori cut out a pass, Purce collected the ball near midfield and used her speed to blow by several defenders. From a tight angle on the right, she squeezed a shot past Bucklin to put the Crimson on the scoreboard.
“We need goals to win and Midge has been essential in finishing opportunities for our team to get results and compete in games,” Rotatori said. “I think her consistency extends beyond just the goals she’s scored, though, to her work ethic and commitment.”
A few minutes later, however, Louisville restored its lead through another freshman. Arianna Ferraro capitalized on another fine assist by Vetere to push the score to 3-1. Just as for Rivers, it was Ferraro’s first goal of her collegiate career.
After an eventful first half, both teams settled down in the second as the Cardinals seemed content to sit deep and see the game out. Harvard had trouble breaking down their defense, and though it outshot Louisville after halftime, neither team mustered a single shot on goal in the final 45 minutes.
Purce led all players with four shots, but Rivers’ two goals on two shots proved to be the difference. Bucklin took home the victory for the Cardinals in goal despite saving just one shot, which came in the third minute.
“Credit to them [Louisville], we just couldn’t break down their defense,” Hamblin said. “We knew it would be a physical game and it was a good test for us. Besides responding poorly, we still showed a lot of good things today.”.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its opening weekend of its 2016 campaign, the Harvard women’s volleyball team played on quite a smaller stage than it did in last year’s finale: the NCAA tournament.
Although the MAC’s capacity doesn’t quite reach 8,000-plus spectators, this weekend’s contest followed a similar trajectory to its time on the national stage. After showing signs of promise in its first game against Siena (1-5), Georgia (6-0) uncovered areas of weakness in the conclusion of the Beantown Challenge, as the Crimson (1-1) went on the split its weekend slate.
GEORGIA 3, HARVARD 0
After dispatching Siena is three sets, Harvard got a taste of its own medicine in its last game of the weekend, as the Bulldogs swept the Crimson.
Georgia failed to drop a set in the Beantown Challenge, with its closest call coming in the second set of the Harvard tilt. A kill from freshman outside hitter Grace Roberts Burbank late in the set broke a 23-all tie and put the squad one point away from tying the match at one set apiece. But Georgia’s Maddie Lobenstein denied Harvard its set point with a kill of her own. The Bulldogs went on to win the next two points and steal away a close-fought set.
Lobenstein led the Bulldogs in kills with 13 on the day, with Megan Spencer trailing right behind with 10 of her own. No Crimson player exceeded six.
The Crimson was notably without senior Grace Weghorst, who is no longer on the roster due to lingering back issues. The Texas native last played on September 25th against Dartmouth and was shut down soon after.
Weghorst was an instrumental part of the Crimson’s 2014 campaign in which the team went on to win a share of the Ivy League for the first time in a decade. The outside hitter finished with 2.57 kills per set, second on the team behind co-captain Corinne Bain.
HARVARD 3, SIENA 0
The Crimson showed no sign of offseason rust in its opening contest, not letting the Saints eclipse 16 points in a single-set on its way to a straight-set victory.
Harvard featured a balanced, with five players registering at least seven kills, including sophomore Jocelyn Meyer, who notched a team-high eight. The Crimson only committed 13 attacking errors, compared to Siena’s 25.
Friday was the debut for Isabelle Tashima, who looks to take over Sindhu Vegesena ‘16, who started at libero for the Crimson in her junior and senior years. The Illinois native registered 11 digs in her opening stint.
