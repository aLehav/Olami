After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Taking advantage of optimal conditions in Shelton, Conn., the Radcliffe heavyweight and lightweight crews rowed to a strong start to their fall seasons at the Head of the Housatonic regatta on Saturday.
Both Black and White squads posted wins, with heavyweight crews recording two first-place finishes and the lightweight team also claiming a victory of its own.
“[The Head of the Housatonic] comes at a good time,” said Radcliffe heavyweight coach Liz O’Leary. “We’re five weeks into school, five weeks into our training, and the Head of the Charles is two weeks away, so this is a tune-up race of sorts.”
The heavyweight team entered two boats in the fours race, three boats in the collegiate eights race, and one boat in the novice race, while the lightweights raced two boats in the doubles, two in the fours, and two in the eights.
None of the rowers had raced the Housatonic River before, adding what Radcliffe rowers cited as an additional challenge.
“It was one of the more difficult courses as an away competitor because there really aren’t any landmarks [on the Housatonic], so you don’t really know where you are all the time,” said heavyweight co-captain Mary Maginnis. “It’s more difficult mentally as a rower, because you don’t know how much longer the race is going to be at any point. So that was one of our goals, to break the race up to know where we were, [and] it worked.”
The Radcliffe lightweight crews got the rare opportunity to row alongside the heavyweights in the regatta, which did not have separate races for the two divisions.
“It was our first race of the season so there was a lot to be learned from it, and hopefully we’ll gain a lot of speed by the Head of the Charles,” lightweight co-captain Veronique Irwin said. “It was a good first experience to get back in the boat and start racing again and figure out where we all are.”
The regatta also allowed the Black and White to measure up against some of its Ivy competitors for the first time this year.
“Yale was there in full force, and Brown was there for the first time, and they’re certainly competitors of ours,” O’Leary said. “It was great to go up against some fast boats and figure out that we’re in the mix, that we’re doing a good job, and that we’re on the right track.”
HEAVYWEIGHTS
The Radcliffe heavyweight 1V fours started the day with a decisive victory over three Yale crews, rowing the 2.7 mile course in 16:28.24, more than 45 seconds in front of the second-place Bulldog boat. The second Black and White heavyweight crew rowed into 10th place, clocking in at 18:36.06.
The novice women’s eights race also claimed victory, as the Black and White boat cruised past second-place Massachusetts by nearly half a minute with a time of 16:12.20.
“Probably the highlight of the day was our novice eight that won their race,” O’Leary said. “It’s always very exciting to win the first race that you have.”
In the collegiate eights race, Yale, rowing one of its home courses, edged out a Radcliffe crew to take the victory with a time of 15:14.19. The top Black and White heavyweight boat finished 10 seconds behind the Bulldogs to grab second with a time of 15:24.31. The other two Radcliffe boats finished in fifth and 10th, respectively.
LIGHTWEIGHTS
The Black and White lightweights had a dominating showing in the doubles sculling race, taking first and second. The top crew posted a time of 17:48.21, while the second boat finished the race in 18:27.60, over a minute faster than any of the other crews in the race.
“Sculling isn’t something that we focus on, so for us to place first and second in that [event] was really exciting,” Irwin said.
In the fours, two Radcliffe lightweight crews held their own against the heavyweights, showing strong fifth-place and ninth-place finishes. The Black and White sent two lightweight crews to the collegiate eights race, where they had a solid outing as well, finishing in eighth and 15th out of the 22 crews.
“The four [race] was great because it showed the depth of our team, especially because we were able to beat a few of the heavyweight boats,” Irwin said. “In the eight, that was also a good showing of our depth since it’s a heavyweight event.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its sole West Coast road trip of the season, Harvard men’s water polo traveled to Southern California this weekend in search of a challenge. The Crimson (12-11, 4-0 CWPA) got just that in three nationally ranked Division I teams and two Division III powerhouses.
The Crimson went zero for five against the California schools over the course of three days. Harvard lost four games at the Gary Troyer Memorial Tournament in Pomona and Claremont before dropping its final game at UC Santa Barbara on Sunday.
“Our expectations coming in were to get better,” Crimson coach Ted Minnis said. “I think what we took away [from this weekend] is that when we play Harvard water polo and stick together, we’re a very good team. If we can keep playing more consistently, we’re going to be much more successful.”
Long Beach State (16-3) defeated Harvard on Friday, 12-5, before Pomona-Pitzer (4-12, 1-0 SCIAC) won the Crimson’s second game, 14-10. On the second day of the tournament, Loyola Marymount (11-6, 7-1 WWPA) picked apart Harvard’s defense for a 22-9 victory, and Claremont-Mudd-Scripps (5-13, 1-1 SCIAC) defeated the Crimson, 16-12. On Sunday, Harvard visited UC Santa Barbara (14-3), who handed the Crimson another 16-12 loss.
UC SANTA BARBARA 16, HARVARD 12
The Crimson faced a 7-1 deficit after the first quarter at UC Santa Barbara on Sunday, allowing the No. 2-ranked team in the country to cruise to an easy victory.
The game evened out in the final three quarters of play as UC Santa Barbara and Harvard scored three goals apiece in the second period. The Crimson outscored the Gauchos in the second half, 8-6.
“We had a rough beginning of the game,” freshman attacker Robbie Fluegge said. “But after that, we settled down, and we realized that if we play our game, work to move the ball around, and take the shots we know we’re supposed to take, we can play with anybody.”
Freshman attacker Noah Harrison tallied four goals to lead Harvard in scoring for the third time on the road trip and added a career-high five steals on defense.
Junior Jimmy Field and freshman Colin Woolway, who shared the duties in net for the Crimson throughout the weekend, combined for four saves versus UC Santa Barbara.
CLAREMONT-M-S 16, HARVARD 12
An eight-goal second quarter against Claremont-Mudd-Scripps was not enough as the Crimson dropped its final game of the Gary Troyer Tournament at Claremont’s Axelrod Pool on Saturday.
Down three after the first quarter of play, the Crimson narrowed the deficit to two after the offensive outpouring in the second quarter.  But the defending NCAA Division III champion extended its lead in the final two quarters to seal the four-goal win.
Sophomore attacker Evan Ramsey had a team-leading three goals. Sophomore utility Max Murphy and junior attacker Will Roller each added two goals. Field and Woolway posted 13 saves.
LOYOLA MARYMOUNT 22, HARVARD 9
Harvard yielded a season-high 22 goals as No. 9 Loyola Marymount controlled the Crimson’s first game of its Saturday double-header at Claremont from start to finish.
Loyola Marymount showed few signs of fatigue after defeating Harvard’s CWPA conference rival Iona, 16-1, earlier in the day. Against Harvard, the Lions carried an 8-3 lead into the second quarter and pulled away in each of the final three frames.
Ramsey, Fluegge, and freshman attacker Blake Lee each scored two goals for the Crimson. Field and Woolway combined for 10 saves.
POMONA-PITZER 14, HARVARD 10
In its most closely contested match of the weekend, Harvard nearly rallied back from an early deficit against the top-ranked team in Division III before dropping its second game Friday at Pomona-Pitzer’s Haldeman Pool.
The Crimson came out of the gates trailing, 4-1, after the first quarter. A goal by Harrison in the first minute of the third cut the Stagehens’ lead to one, but Pomona-Pitzer responded with two unanswered strikes to put the game out of reach.
Harrison scored a career-high six goals and posted three steals and an assist. Zepfel also contributed two goals, and Field and Woolway made nine saves.
LONG BEACH STATE 12, HARVARD 5
Harvard kept pace with the 49ers in the opening minutes and trailed, 5-4, at halftime. But Long Beach State outscored the Crimson by three goals in each of the final two frames to clinch a comfortable victory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a windy Saturday at Soldier Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium, the Harvard women’s soccer team tied Cornell, 1-1, in double overtime. The Crimson scored early in the game and gave up a late goal in the second half after holding the Big Red scoreless for most of the game.
Harvard (5-3-3, 1-1-1 Ivy) got off to a quick start when freshman Emily Mosbacher drove down the left side of the Cornell defense into the penalty box.
The rookie then flicked the ball over to crossing sophomore Meg Casscells-Hamby, who kicked it past the goalie to give the Crimson a 1-0 lead four minutes into the game. It was Casscells-Hamby’s third goal of the season, which tied her for the team lead with senior Taryn Kurcz, who is also a Crimson sports executive.
For the rest of the half, Harvard drove down the left side of the Cornell (1-10-1, 0-2-1) defense a number of times, creating multiple opportunities. But Harvard was unable to tack on an insurance goal.
In the second half, the defense held strong against a series of Big Red attacks until Cornell junior Mary Keroack scored her first goal of the season in the 74th minute, knocking a corner past Crimson sophomore goalkeeper Bethany Kanten into the upper right corner of the net.
“It was a struggle for us getting into a flow today,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “We scored early, and then we let down. We’ve done this one time before this year, and it’s something we need to work on.”
The Crimson applied pressure all day against Cornell goalkeeper Tori Christ. Led by Casscells-Hamby and co-captain Peyton Johnson, the team shot the ball 25 times, with 11 of those on goal. Harvard outshot its opponent, 11-6, in the first half and had seven corner kicks to its opponent’s four.
“We were really great at getting around the corner today,” Johnson said. “Our forwards did a great job beating their players one-on-one. We can stand to be a little bit more dynamic and less predictable in our offense, but I think we created some great chances, and that’s how we got the first goal.”
On the defensive side of the ball, the Crimson held stout against a Cornell attack that had scored six goals in its last three games. The Big Red only had two shots on goal on the day and none in the first half, as Harvard controlled play with the wind at its back. In the second half, the Crimson faced the wind, which made it harder to clear balls from its side of the field, and gave up the one score on eight shots. It was the fifth game in a row Harvard gave up one or fewer goals.
“The defense is getting better, and I’m pleased with how hard they are defending,” Leone said. “They’re really being accountable. One goal against any of these teams in the Ivy League is pretty good.”
This was the third time in four games that the team has needed more than 90 minutes to decide the outcome of the contest.
Three of the Crimson’s games ended in a tie after double overtime, as many as the rest of the Ivy League combined.
“When it comes to the Ivy League, you definitely don’t want to lose,” Johnson said. “You want to get a point, at least, in overtime, so it’s an interesting balance between trying to come away with at least a point and wanting three. You want to go for your chances but not cede any chances and let overtime slip away.”
After three games, the Crimson trails Ivy League co-leaders Princeton (7-3-1, 3-0-0) and Penn (7-4-1, 3-0-0) by five points.
With five league games left, including one against last-place Brown (6-4-0, 0-3-0) and one away game at Princeton, Johnson said moving forward, Harvard must focus on its own performances and not the results of other teams.
“What’s definitely going to linger in our minds is that we had this game and things slipped away from us,” Johnson said. “At this point, all we can do about our Ivy chances is think one game at a time. We can control what we can control and that’s the games we play.
“It’s a very up-and-down league, and there’s definitely a possibility of some craziness from other teams,” Johnson added.  “We are just going to try and take care of what we can.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard continued Ivy play on its home court this weekend, resulting in two completely opposite outcomes in the Crimson’s 3-0 win over Brown and then a 3-0 loss to Yale.
In the game against the Bears (4-10, 0-4 Ivy), the Crimson (5-11, 2-3) totaled its most blocks this season—15—en route to a three-set victory over Brown, 25-19, 25-12, 25-23.
The next night, Harvard was outplayed by the Bulldogs (9-5, 5-0), currently the top team in the Ancient Eight, by a score of 25-19, 25-18, 25-15.
YALE 3, HARVARD 0
The second set for Harvard seemed to be a chance for victory with a strong 9-1 lead, but Yale fought back and tied it at 13-13 before eventually winning the set, 25-18.
“They’re a team that doesn’t make a lot of mistakes,” junior right side Erin Cooney said. “I think that we could have taken advantage of that strong lead more, and it was tough to see us lose that lead. When we play [Yale] next, we know that they do have weaknesses, and we should take advantage of those next time.”
In the first set of the game, the Bulldogs came out gunning with 13 kills, and it was the Crimson who steadily came back to tie it up 14-14. Harvard eventually fell, 25-19.
“Yale is definitely one of the...scrappier teams we’ve played,” said freshman outside hitter Kathleen Wallace. “They have really good ball control and a faster pace.”
Despite the loss, Harvard’s back end stayed strong with 49 digs, more than it had the night before against Brown.
“Kristen Casey has just totally come into her own as libero,” co-captain setter Beth Kinsella said. “She and [junior defensive specialist] Natalie Doyle have this relentless pursuit for every ball. It really elevates the overall team play. They’re back there throwing their bodies on the floor.”
Cooney had six kills in the first set and finished the game with nine, tying with Wallace for the team lead.
Yale setter Kelly Johnson totaled a game-high 13 kills and helped the Bulldogs to a team kill percentage of .512 in the last set, which Yale took by double-digits, 25-15.
Harvard will not face the Bulldogs again until the end of its season, but the Crimson already has its sights set on the rematch.
“I cannot wait to beat Yale,” Cooney said.  “We will, and I know we can.”
HARVARD 3, BROWN 0
Key to the sweep of Brown was the Crimson’s defense at the net. Harvard tallied 15 blocks in three sets.
“When you’re a hitter and you get blocked—that is the most demeaning thing that can happen to you,” Kinsella said. “So blocking someone else is better than getting a kill, better than getting an ace. It’s just the best feeling.  We got so pumped up.”
Co-captain outside hitter Taylor Docter led the team with nine kills in the contest, and Wallace was not far behind with eight.
Sophomore outside hitter Kristen Casey and freshman setter Hannah Schmidt led the team with nine digs apiece.
At the start of the first set, the Bears seemed to have the upper hand with a 5-1 lead.
Harvard came back attacking, but it wasn’t until Wallace and freshman middle blocker Caroline Holte blocked the first ball of the game that the Crimson tied up the score, 6-6.
That block and a series of many more that put Harvard on the road to victory.
Holte tallied a career-best eight blocks—the most blocks in a three-set match for the Crimson since 2008.
Harvard led a steady offensive with a consistent 13 kills in each game.
In the second set, Harvard came out strong with a 4-0 lead.
Dominating from behind the back line, the Crimson totaled six service aces—four from Doyle.
For Harvard, the third set was not as easy a win as the first two. The Crimson had a six-point win streak in the middle of the match, but the game was otherwise very back and forth between the Crimson and Brown. Harvard ultimately managed a 25-21 victory.
“We can improve on working on the pace of our game,” Wallace said. “We can be a bit faster.”
A pair of errors by the Bears and a kill by sophomore middle blocker Caroline Walters sealed the Crimson’s second Ivy win.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard football team ended up running away from Cornell for a 45-13 win Saturday at Harvard Stadium, but the game’s result was still up in the air at the beginning of the fourth quarter.
Up 24-13, the Crimson (4-0, 2-0 Ivy) faced a long third down from its own 21-yard line on the second play of the quarter.
Senior Colton Chapple dropped back on an obvious passing down and was afforded time to survey the field thanks to sound blocking from the offensive line, which featured two backups with sophomore Will Whitman and senior Jack Holuba both injured.
Eventually, Chapple stepped up and hit junior Cam Brate in stride across the middle of the field.
Brate took it from there, running down the sideline for a 40-yard gain that flipped the field for Harvard. Two plays later, Chapple tossed the ball to junior Ricky Zorn for a touchdown that gave the home team some breathing room.
Attempting to post an answer, the Big Red (2-2, 1-1) faced a third down of its own on its next drive, backed up in its own territory just like the Crimson was. But things didn’t turn out as well for Cornell, as pressure from senior Nnamdi Obukwelu forced quarterback Jeff Mathews to heave a pass that was intercepted by junior Chris Splinter. Harvard scored on the ensuing drive to put the game away.
Those two third downs were indicative of how each offense performed in crucial situations. The Crimson’s first-team offense converted seven of its 13 third downs en route to racking up 544 offensive yards thanks to a balanced offense and multiple receiving threats, while the Big Red got a first down on only two of its 14 third downs due to pressure from the Harvard D-line and tight coverage by the home team’s secondary.
The Crimson dominated the time of possession battle as a result of those lopsided tallies, accumulating 30 first downs compared to the Cornell’s 14 and controlling the ball for 35 minutes compared to the visitor’s 25.
Keeping the Big Red attack off the field was crucial to keeping Mathews out of synch.
On the year, Harvard now has the highest third-down conversion rate in the Ivy League at 54 percent, while it holds opponents to a league-low 26 percent conversion rate.
RISING TO THE CHALLENGE
Fans entering Harvard Stadium Saturday prepared to see Cornell quarterback Jeff Mathews show everyone why he is the reigning Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year and a signal-caller with NFL-level potential. Fans exited the stadium having witnessed a performance on that level; it just came from the other guy.
Chapple completed two-thirds of his 36 passing attempts for a grand total of 362 yards and four scores, including three during the first 16 minutes of action.
Rarely did he miss open receivers, and when no one was open, Chapple often scrambled for positive yardage, finishing the day with 53 rushing yards and one touchdown on the ground.
On the other side of the ball, Mathews completed fewer than half of his 44 attempts for just over 300 yards. He threw one touchdown pass compared to two interceptions, tripling his total for the year.
Though it may have come against a less experienced defense, Chapple’s performance was good enough to earn his second straight Ivy League Offensive Player of the Week award and garner high praise from his coach.
“I made a comment to Colton...that we have a long way to go, but he would get my vote for conference player of the year if we were voting today,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “We’ve had taller QBs, we’ve had this or that, we’ve had such a great lineage of QBs, but I don’t think anyone has been a better decision maker and been a more poised football player.”
Chapple’s passing efficiency score of 174.5 is nearly 30 points higher than Dartmouth’s Alex Park’s score, which is second in the Ivy League. Nationally, Chapple’s score ranks second in the FCS behind only Kyle Essington of Stony Brook.
THIRTEEN FOULS, NO HARM
Overshadowed by stats indicating the Crimson’s offensive and defensive dominance, the undefeated team committed a litany of penalties Saturday, including six false starts and multiple holding fouls.
A number of these penalties were called on Harvard’s backup offensive linemen, but others went against veteran starters like senior Kyle Juszczyk.
But the 100 penalty yards did little to slow the Crimson in what became a comfortable Harvard win.
“We are not a team that can overcome 100 yards in penalties—I can tell you that,” said Big Red coach Kent Austin, impressed by the Crimson’s ability to overcome its mistakes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s tennis team traveled to two different coasts this week to compete in two separate tournaments. Co-captains Kristin Norton and Hideko Tachibana flew to Pacific Palisades, Calif., for the Riviera/ITA Women’s All-American Championship, an invite-only event. The duo teamed up for doubles play but was unable to make it past the first round on Wednesday.
Friday through Sunday, the remainder of the team played in the William and Mary Fall Tournament in Williamsburg, Va. At the event, three Crimson players took first place in their flights: sophomore Sylvia Li and freshman Amanda Lin, who went undefeated in doubles play, and freshman Hai-Li Kong, who posted a 3-0 record in singles play.
“We all worked really hard this [past] week, and I felt we all improved a lot,” Lin said. “So this tournament, we all played a lot better.”
The tournaments marked the Crimson’s second weekend of competition following the Columbia Invitational on Sept. 14.
WILLIAM AND MARY FALL TOURNAMENT
Harvard players participated in four of the tournament’s singles flights. Kong had the best performance for the Crimson with a first-place finish in the Cherle Dow Flight. The freshman breezed through the competition, never dropping a set and finishing with a 6-1, 6-0 win against Penn’s Alex Ion in the finals.
“Hai-Li played really well this tournament,” Lin said. “She’s worked really hard since the last tournament and has gotten a lot more consistent. She pulled through some really close matches and was really confident on the court. She just played unbelievable.”
In the same flight, junior Natalie Blosser finished sixth after losing 4-6, 6-4, 10-4, in the fifth-place match against Kansas University’s Paulina Los.
Harvard had two competitors in the Julie Shiflet Flight as well. Freshman Crystal Yen won two close matches before falling in the finals to Kansas University’s Claire Dreyer, 6-2, 6-0. In the semifinals, Dreyer beat junior Hannah Morrill, 6-3, 6-1, sending Morrill the third-place match. Morrill dropped that match to Kai Broomfield of Marshall, 6-2, 3-6, 10-7.
The Lauren Nikolaus Flight saw similar results for the Crimson. Lin swept her first two matches but also fell in the finals. She won the first set, 5-7, lost the second, 6-3, and was unable to pull out the tiebreaker, 10-5.
“For me, it was a lot of fun because I had my whole team with me, and we were cheering for each other,” Lin said. “The fact that they were cheering for me helped me pull through tough matches.”
Li won her opening match but was unable to produce the same result in her next two, garnering a fourth-place finish.
Freshman Amy He was the only Harvard player in the Megan Moulton-Levy Flight, where she finished in sixth after losing the fifth-place match, 7-5, 6-3, to Carmen Sandor of Penn State.
Though the Crimson’s top doubles pair was not competing in the same tournament, Harvard still saw solid results from its other doubles contenders. The Katrin Guenther Flight hosted two Crimson tandems in the finals. The pair of Li and Lin defeated teammates Kong and Blosser, 8-4, to earn first place.
Harvard’s final duo of He and Morrill took fourth in the Karen van der Merwe Flight.
RIVIERA/ITA WOMEN’S ALL-AMERICAN CHAMPIONSHIP
Doubles partners Norton and Tachibana traveled to the west coast for the qualifying rounds of the All-American Championship. The tandem faced Duke’s Mary Clayton and Marianne Jodoin in their first and only match, which they lost, 8-4.
“Hideko and I didn’t play to the best of our abilities, but it’s always an honor to get invited to the All-American Tournament because not many teams qualify,” Norton said. “It was still a great opportunity to be at a tournament where the teams with the best results compete against each other. And even though we lost to the team from Duke, they were great players and we were excited to be there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After winning a head-to-head tiebreaker against Eckerd, the Harvard co-ed sailing team finished ninth in the Moody Trophy, hosted by the University of Rhode Island, with 162 points on the weekend.
The 19-team regatta saw very inconsistent weather patterns. After warm temperatures and strong winds on Saturday, Sunday brought light breezes, and races were consequently canceled after attempting to wait out the conditions.
Five Ivy League teams were in attendance, including Yale, Columbia, Brown, and Dartmouth. Cross-town rivals Tufts, MIT, Boston College, and Boston University also participated in the regatta.
Saturday’s races were marked by close finishes and crowded mark roundings. Both Crimson teams participated in eight races during the day and registered single-digit finishes in half of those.
“We showed improvements over the course of the day on Saturday,” junior Luke O’Connor said. “In both divisions, we did not have a very good first set, but by the last few sets we were very consistent.”
Harvard’s Division A boat, skippered by sophomore Brian Drumm and crewed by O’Connor and freshman Jacob Bradt, finished in 13th place with 86 points. After just one top-10 finish in the first five races, the team posted three in its last three races to catch Hobart College and William Smith College, though Harvard ultimately fell in a head-to-head tiebreaker.
“We had a little bit of starting problems, especially at the beginning of the day,” O’Connor said.  “We felt good about our boat speed and boat handling most of the day. We had some opportunities to have some great races that ended up being mid-fleet races.”
The Crimson’s Division B boat fared better, earning 76 points en route to a 10th-place finish. Skippered by sophomore Michael Drumm and crewed by junior captain Benjamin Lamont, the boat logged four finishes in the top eight, three of which came in the final four racess. Harvard placed just four points behind ninth-place finisher Connecticut College.
Stanford took second place in the A division of the Moody Trophy with 31 points and first place in the B division with 30 points.
The Cardinal ran away with first place overall, beating out second-place Brown by 18 points and topping Harvard by 101 points.
The Crimson has been focusing on the fundamentals this season and has shown improvement with each regatta.
“Sailing is a sport which can get incredibly complicated, and it’s crucial that each little piece is in place,” freshman Andrew Mollerus said. “The team has done a really great job at breaking everything down.”
With the exception of a second-place finish in the Tufts Central Series 1 in early September, the Crimson has struggled to come up with favorable results this season. Harvard graduated a talented class of seniors last year, and the young makeup of the team has made it difficult to find consistency. The men’s team only has two seniors on the roster, while the women’s team has none.
“This year is definitely a rebuilding year,” O’Connor said. “We have a few good sophomores and some really promising freshmen.”
Among the biggest losses has been former captain Brendan Kopp, who graduated last year after being named an All-American skipper by the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association. He and junior Sarah Pierson helped lead Harvard to a fifth-place finish in the ICSA/Gill Coed Dinghy National Championship last year.
“Kopp was definitely a big loss,” O’Connor said. “The year before, we also graduated a number of talented seniors, including three really good skippers, so last year we actually surprised a lot of people by still doing very well.”
With such a young team this year, the Crimson is expecting to keep improving throughout the season and into the spring.
“We are making some really great improvements,” Mollerus said. “We have a lot of people who by their junior or senior year are going to be some of the top sailors in the country. We are building towards a strong end of the fall season and a really big spring season.”
Harvard will race in the Women’s Intersectional at Yale next weekend, and the co-ed team will travel to Dartmouth for the Captain Hurst Bowl. The Crimson is looking to capitalize on its potential and improve upon this week’s result.
“We would love to crack the top five in Intersectional, which we haven’t done yet,” O’Connor said. “Right now, qualifying for ACCs is our short-term goal, but we are really looking toward the spring and toward next year for more long-term success.”

John D. Cody, a Harvard Law School graduate, was arrested last Monday on charges of fraud up to $100 million over an eight-year period. He used a fake charity to collect donations from 41 states, under the pretense of helping Navy veterans, according to the Huffington Post.
When Cody was arrested, officials found that he used the fake name Bobby Thompson and signed legal papers as "Mr. X," leading authorities to become suspicious of his story. U.S. Marshal Peter J. Elliott took charge of the investigation. While searching Google for information about the suspect, Elliott found a 1987 wanted poster for a similar-looking man named John Cody, who disappeared after being accused of estate fraud and making off with around $100,000.
Because Cody was never actually arrested and only indicted, his fingerprints were not taken and did not exist in the police record, making it extremely hard to identify him. With the help of the F.B.I., Elliott eventually identified Cody by matching his fingerprints to prints found in the 1969 military database from when Cody served as a captain in the U.S. military intelligence. On March 11, 2012, Cody will face the justice system he managed to evade for so long.
"This is definitely John Donald Cody," Elliott said in at a courthouse news conference. "He's a guy that thought, number one, he could never get caught, and number two, he would never be identified. And we were able to do both."
Even though Cody went to HLS, we're not sure he'll be able to talk his way out of this one.

If you're straining to read this, put down the Starbucks—Harvard researchers recently found a link between glaucoma incidence in adults and consumption of more than three cups of coffee a day. Between squinting and sipping, Harvard researchers have made multiple discoveries in the past few weeks, from using genetics to figure out when the Neanderthals were most likely to have mated with modern humans to discovering that Mexicans are more likely than Britons to abstain from kissing to prevent the spread of swine flu.
 
Researchers from the Harvard Medical School, MIT, and the Max Planck Institute in Germany recently published an article that suggests that interbreeding between modern humans and Neanderthals may have occurred during and after the period in which modern humans emigrated from Africa. To do so, the researchers used linkage disequilibrium to determine the extent to which there was gene flow from Neanderthals to modern Europeans. Their findings indicated that any such flow occurred 37,000-86,000 years ago, just as modern humans were believed to have been emigrating from Africa to other continents.
 
The Harvard School of Public Health conducted a study to assess global receptivity of swine flu prevention strategies, such as hand washing. Questionnaires were distributed via phone calls in the US, Argentina, Japan, Mexico, and the UK. Interestingly, the survey found that 46 percent of Mexicans versus only 2 percent of Britons refrained from kissing or hugging in order to prevent the spread of the H1N1 flu. The study suggests that preventative measures such as abstaining from contact as well as using hand sanitizer and frequent hand washing is the best way to combat the pandemic.
 
Researchers from the Harvard and Yale medical schools confirmed that sugary beverages contribute to significant weight gain. Two hundred and twenty-four adolescents classified as obese or overweight who regularly drank sugary drinks were assigned to two groups. The control group continued their current diet, while the experimental group was placed on a program to decrease their consumption of sugary drinks. One year after the intervention, the researchers checked in with the experimental group. It was found that adolescents in the experimental group gained weight at a slower rate than their control counterparts who continued to drink sugary beverages.
 
The Harvard Medical School and the University of Bordeaux in France published a study linking sleeping pill usage and dementia in retirees. Out of 1063 patients who took benzodiazepines and were previously free of dementia, 253 developed dementia in a 15-year follow-up period. When coupled with a control group of the same age that did not regularly use sleeping pills, those who used the drug had a 50 percent increased risk of developing dementia.
