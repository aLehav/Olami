After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Knees bounce, fingers snap, and toes tap on a Wednesday night in the Horner Room of Agassiz Theater. Preparing for the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players’ production of “Pirates of Penzance,” the singer-actresses are full of energy at this late hour. Music director Mateo A. Lincoln ’19 shifts from his seat at the Steinway to his place among the circle of students, encouraging a lively and productive dynamic. All seem to be drawing life from Gilbert and Sullivan’s celebrated, sprightly score.
A unique twist on the original production, this season’s show is to be set in the mobster scene of 1940s New York. Fret not, Gilbert and Sullivan aficionados. “The choice to make it in 1940s New York is almost completely visual—there aren’t many lines being changed and in the music there are almost no changes,” said Lincoln. The set, however, will be updated. Done entirely in gray-scale, the stage pieces are to be given a urban look. “Everyone sets it on a pirate ship,” said Arianna N. Paz ’19, who will play Mabel. However, audiences can look forward to quite a different visual experience from the conventional productions: both the lighting and the costumes will be sources for pops of color.
For many of the cast and crew, “Pirates of Penzance” was an early part of their musical experiences and aspirations. “Mabel in particular was a role I always, always wanted to play,” said Paz, “Now I get to do it, and it’s really special.”
For Lincoln, “Pirates” was one of the first productions he ever saw. For Producer Richard S. Tong ’19, the show marked his introduction into the world of Gilbert and Sullivan. “The people who are in this cast are amongst the most talented of people on campus,” Tong said.
What has contributed to the historic success of “Pirates of Penzance” is its ability to evoke lighthearted laughter from every audience member regardless of age, external circumstances, or political climate. “I want them to leave the building humming something,” said Lincoln. “We need that these days.”
Though the show itself is over 100 years old, productions like the one upcoming on campus have the potential to keep it fresh and relevant. “[We’re bringing] a new breath of fresh air to a production that has been done pretty similarly throughout our history,” Paz said.

The hum of voices singing drifted down the hallways of the Loeb Experimental Theater, where a rehearsal room door failed to contain the explosive harmonies of the cast of the musical “Spring Awakening.” The show, directed by Laura Sky Herman ’19, portrays “youth in revolt” by framing the experiences of 19th century German teenagers with contemporary rock music.
The musical, adapted from a play of the same name by Frank Wedekind, addresses themes of sexuality, religion, and communication, among others. Cast member Henry R. Lynch ’20, who plays Hanschen, said, “It’s interesting that it’s based off of a play written in 1891. While it does feel old in some scenes, the scenes and the relationships between people are still true to this day.”
Herman’s unique vision for the show emphasizes power dynamics within the physical boundaries of the stage. “The show is about oppression and freedom,” she said. “Something we’ve tried to focus on is the hierarchy of individuals and the spaces they are allowed to inhabit.” The production makes use of different levels of staging: The show’s adult characters traverse the balcony, while a platform represents the world of the kids. Cleverly choreographed level shifts wordlessly reflect the status of each character as their experiences shape the way they engage with the space.
In dealing with such serious subject matter, the cast of 13 do not take their roles lightly. Karalyn E. Joseph ’21, who plays Wendla, is particularly conscious of her role in context of the greater themes of the show. “Wendla is not naive–I feel like she’s often seen as weak and naive,” she said. “She’s a bright powerful girl, who’s given no information about the world. Through no fault of her own she’s thrown into society. I’m careful not to portray her as naive.”
Both Joseph and Herman hope that the audience will connect to the show. “I think there’s so many messages in this show that four people could come see the show and each leave with a different connection,” Joseph said. “There are so many possible takeaways that are all valid.”
Spring Awakening will run at the Loeb Experimental Theater from Oct. 27 until Nov 4.

In Adrienne Kennedy’s play, “The Owl Answers,” the audience members are on the stage of Farkas Hall rather than in the theater’s seats, yet a wall obstructs their view. Once around the wall, they stand by graffiti of an owl on one side and a massive tower-like structure on the other. They sit on low benches around the tower, from which a chandelier, a cage, and an owl hang.
A spiral staircase wraps around the outside of the tower. Frozen in action along this staircase are actors playing Shakespeare, Chaucer, William the Conqueror, and Anne Boleyn. At the top, a woman in a white avian dress and an owl mask wildly flaps her arms, twists her head, and stares down audience members. Her male compatriot dances on the floor, wildly eyeing the arriving guests.
One female actress’ anachronistic clothing and unsteady presence make her particularly eye-catching. This woman, Clara, is the protagonist of the show, and once she enters the tower, the drama begins, mere inches from seated audience members.
The production is purposefully confusing, with constant light changes and sudden sound effects. Actors deliver certain lines of dialogue multiple times with variable intonation, and scenes often repeat, each time with an aspect changed. The play intentionally disorients through its non-linear plot and unconventional dialogue choices, evoking a sense of confusion as Clara, the illegitimate daughter of a white man and a black woman in the American South, struggles to define herself.
Due to its modern production and timely subject matter, it may be surprising that “The Owl Answers” first premiered in 1965 in the midst of the Civil Rights Movement. Director of Production David R. Gammons ’92 has a close personal relationship with Kennedy that began at Harvard College. “Ever since I had first read her plays and studied with her, I wanted to direct her plays,” said Gammons. “Her work though is highly experimental, and though it is also highly acclaimed and important, there are not a lot of professional theater companies that will agree to do her plays. When TDM approached me last year and asked me if I’d like to come back to Harvard and be a guest artist, I said I think I want to do ‘The Owl Answers.’”
Through the production of “The Owl Answers,” Gammons said that he sought to do justice to Kennedy’s work and message while simultaneously taking into account his own identity in relation to the play’s subject matter. “I am a white man, and that gave me a lot of pause to proceed with this project. I’m deeply grateful to my cast to be so generous with their own experiences,” said Gammons.
Because of her friendship with Gammons, Kennedy was intimately involved in TDM’s production of her play, partially through the help of her grandson Jacob Kennedy. “My role in the production of ‘The Owl Answers’ was initially to observe for my own benefit, but in talking to David Gammons, the director, he influenced me to become directly involved, and from then on I was providing notes to the actors, suggestions and edits to the performance itself, and just any general advice,” said Jacob Kennedy.
Assistant Dramaturge Landy Erlick ’19, who is the literary editor, noted the unique position she occupied by interacting with Adrienne Kennedy so intimately. “It was such a remarkable experience to oscillate between reading scholarly articles on Kennedy’s work and reading emails from Kennedy herself directed to our team. For me, knowing that Ms. Kennedy was involved in the production spoke to the idea that ‘The Owl Answers’ is in constant communication with time periods, cultural movements, and its own past productions,” said Erlick.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In November 2016, graduate student workers at Harvard held an election to decide whether or not to unionize. That election was marred by the University’s failure to provide a complete and accurate list of workers eligible to vote, a long-established requirement of employers in union elections sustained by decades of case law. As a result, the Regional Director of the National Labor Relations Board ruled the results invalid and called for a new election. The University has appealed that decision to the national level, ostensibly in the hope that an NLRB now stacked with appointments made by President Donald Trump will side against graduate student unionization.
We, the undersigned faculty members, call on Harvard to drop its appeal to the federal NLRB. Harvard’s endowment performance has flagged in recent years, raises in faculty and staff salaries last year were lower than the rate of inflation, and new tenure lines are only seldom granted to departments wishing to replace retiring faculty or to expand into new teaching areas. Using the University’s resources to deny graduate workers their democratic right to a free and fair election on unionization—whatever the results of that election—is a misuse of funds that could be far better spent supporting teaching and research.
At this point in the history of North American higher education, the argument that graduate teachers and researchers are not “real” workers is unsustainable. They teach our discussion sections, do our grading, mentor our students, and run our labs. They are often compelled to take on assignments that have far more to do with curricular demands than with their own scholarly needs. Teaching and research assistants at public universities across the United States, including at institutions where many of us have either studied or taught, have enjoyed the protection of union contracts—and, most importantly, the right to decide for themselves whether they want union representation—for many decades.
As for the rights of graduate teachers and researchers to unionize at private universities, which are governed by the National Labor Relations Act rather than by state law, the NLRB has see-sawed back and forth. In 2000, in a case involving New York University, the Board held that NYU’s graduate teachers were employees with a protected right to join a union and engage in collective bargaining. In 2004, the Bush administration’s NLRB overturned that precedent, ruling that decision that graduate workers at private universities were not employees and therefore were not entitled to NLRA protections. In 2016, the Obama administration’s NLRB reversed that decision on the grounds that it “deprived an entire category of workers of the protections of the [National Labor Relations] Act without a convincing justification,” leading to a spate of organizing drives at institutions like Columbia, Boston College, Tufts, Brandeis, Duke, and Harvard. Now, the Ivy League universities await a Trump NLRB decision to flip the rules of the game once more—while, in the meantime, encouraging faculty to stress the “downsides” of unionization to their advisees.
This legal tug-of-war shows no signs of abating, as the Board’s majority will continue to switch from Democratic to Republican and back again in accordance with presidential politics. This leaves Harvard with a choice. Will it continue to spend untold sums on lawyers and legal fees, using capricious NLRB decisions as cover for its refusal to offer graduate teachers and researchers a chance at a free and fair election? Will it risk, through its appeal, threatening the national precedent that employers must provide accurate lists of eligible voters in union elections? Or will it choose the high road, dropping its appeal and adopting an official position of neutrality on the unionization question while its graduate teachers and researchers vote anew?
As Harvard faculty, we urge the University administration to choose the high road. We have unqualified faith in the ability of graduate workers on this campus to debate the pros and cons of union representation and to make an informed choice for themselves. Harvard should step aside and let them do so.

The striking gender gap in Harvard’s Mathematics Department is not surprising for those who concentrate in this field—and especially not for non-male students, who face daily struggles and self-doubt in their academic pursuits. However, the data on gender demographics as well as the personal stories of non-male math concentrators illuminate to the rest of the Harvard community the apparent need to take immediate action to improve the circumstances for these students.
One challenge for non-male students concentrating in Mathematics is the gender bias within the field itself. It is caused by many factors, including an internal bias that men are inherently better at math, causing women to think they are not on the same level. More lamentably, Mathematics concentration advisers themselves may fall into this trap, as non-male students at Harvard report that their advisers and the concentration often encourage them to take the lower-level classes. While we acknowledge that there is a pre-existing gender gap in mathematics coming into Harvard College, the unfortunate experiences of non-male Mathematics students suggests that the gender bias persists and perhaps even widens during college.
The lack of diversity, and in particular the lack of faculty diversity, is not an issue limited to the Mathematics Department. Many of Harvard’s other departments face similar problems of under representation of marginalized backgrounds that reflect the disparities in academia on the national scale. The need for faculty diversification remains much-needed, and we hope it is on the agenda of administrators at Harvard.
However, while we continue to advocate for measures to diversify Harvard’s faculty, immediate steps can and must also be taken to improve the experience of current non-male Mathematics students on this campus. There are already a number of programs on this campus that aim to do this. Women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, a mentorship program offered by the Harvard College Women’s Center, and Gender Inclusivity in Math, an undergraduate organization dedicated to reducing the gender gap in Harvard’s Mathematics Department, for example, recognize the need for increased support for non-male students in the Department and have created initiatives to directly tackle this issue.
But instead of solely placing the burden on non-male faculty members and non-male students to create support systems for themselves, we encourage male faculty to also take on larger roles in these programs. With a dearth of non-male faculty mentors for undergraduates, male faculty members should take the initiative in creating these mentorship relationships with non-male students. Moreover, by getting more involved in these programs, we hope that male faculty members can better understand the struggles faced by non-male students and the challenges they face in their field.
Finally, given that the student-run climate survey came with a set of recommendations by students, those leading the Mathematics Department should publicly evaluate and respond to the recommendations. It is the obligation of the Department to think critically about the issue of gender inequity in their field and to allocate more resources to resolving this issue.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ruben: There’s beauty in seeing a room full of smiling faces bobbing their heads to songs that flirt with both English and Spanish, saturated sweetly with the sounds of Latin America. Through Latinx cultural groups, we transport little slivers of our homes, of the Latin American diaspora, into rooms on campus that have—for the majority of this institution's history—excluded people who look like us.
But Latinx cultural groups are not just here to serve as a spectacle of food and music. They play an intimately personal role to Latinx students, particularly those who struggle with feeling as if they belong to this institution.
Zoe: At the first Fuerza Latina meeting I ever went to, I felt like I was stumbling into an unknown yet familiar world colorfully painted with vibrant personalities that reminded me of home. I was embarking on a journey of what being Latina meant, trying to discover my own definition of Latinidad. It was hard coming fresh from a world where no one I knew had ever had to say they were Latino outside of boxes checked for standardized tests. In every way, college meant exploring the identity I had never felt authentic enough to be, surrounded by others who were also grappling with the same questions of what it meant to be Latinx on this campus, in this nation, and in the world.
R: The Latinx cultural groups are the first spaces in which these feelings of exclusion and marginalization are validated by others who’ve felt parallel sentiments. For many students, membership in Latinx cultural groups is a form of resistance and survival—in preventing us from transferring, empowering us to thrive, and making navigating this institution possible.
They play an indispensable role in supporting Latinx students. And yet, Harvard, in its mission and marketing, views them as instruments of the “transformative learning experience” it aims to offer our non-Latinx peers, not as vital aspects of many Latinx students’ experience here.
Z: The day I was elected Treasurer of Fuerza Latina, I smiled so widely I couldn’t hold it in. I was going to be able to be a part of the magic and have a hand in creating the feeling of familia, a solid connection which grounded me in a freshman year of complete unknown. I had dreams of helping cultivate a community where I could make other Latinxs feel welcome and valid, on a campus where I know that didn’t always happen. I wanted to open the doors of celebrating the Latinx identity, from meetings to study breaks, filled with food, decorations, and music, to remind us of what we miss most about home. I quickly realized how naive I was to believe that Fuerza could build a strong community between its members and make up for the lack of resources provided by the College.
R: The Harvard Foundation offers a glaring example of the way institutional support is predicated on the idea that cultural groups’ main purpose is to teach the broader student body about their ethnicities and cultures. The Foundation’s funding guidelines say that they “provide funding for food events, provided that the food will serve to introduce students to ethnic cuisine” and that “closed, sit-down dinners” cannot be covered. A dinner with Latinx comfort food meant to help Latinx students cope with homesickness would not be covered, but an event for students seeking nothing more than free food would be.
Z: The struggle to find funding at Harvard as a treasurer for a cultural organization reveals more than it should. I have sat in front of a board of my fellow students who have the power to influence race relations at the College through allocating funds to organizations, like mine, that address the subject. I have been peppered by them with questions requiring me to defend why my proposed event is important, if it’s achieving the definition of “inclusivity” they deemed to be the right one—only to be rejected because it was, in their eyes, “not open to the entire Harvard community.” I have been made to feel like the worth of my community is explicitly tied to how I can “share” my culture with others, even when event attendance has never been discriminatory and the Latinx identity is inherently interracial, because of colonialism and forced migration.
R: Latinx cultural groups cannot focus on exhibiting Latinx culture when their leaders feel a moral responsibility to support Latinx students who are struggling. As leaders of cultural groups, we’re happy to share our culture and lived experiences with our classmates the way administrators hope we will, but we cannot be expected to do so when we don’t have the resources to support our members first. Standardized operational budgets for cultural groups could address our lack of resources. The establishment of a multicultural center would help. Alternate forms of funding for internal, targeted club events would be game-changing. Support us first. Then ask us to introduce you to our worlds.
Z: As a leader in a large cultural organization, I have not felt supported by the College and have experienced moments where I wished I didn’t have to fit events into either the agenda of the Undergraduate Council or the Foundation. I have had to ensure that Fuerza’s purpose of filling the holes created by failures on the part of the College to be there for Latinx students—by providing representative mentors, professors, mental health professionals, physical spaces, and financial support—were actually funded.
In a political climate where communities of color are consistently under attack, our communities must be able to simultaneously stand on their own and support inter-cultural conversations that consist of more than, in my case, ordering Felipe’s and inviting the entire Harvard student body to try on my Mexican identity for the night. There needs to be more support for cultural organizations to cultivate their own communities, or else this label of inclusivity needs to be shed for what it really is: easily consumable bits of ethnic identities.

Nathaniel A. Raymond, director of the Signal Program on Human Security and Technology at the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, called for the refocusing of humanitarian relief from technology and data science back to the issue of human rights in a lecture at the Law School Tuesday.
“I frankly think we need coders and hackers significantly less than we need lawyers,” Raymond said, adding that students at the Law School can “articulate the problems and the gaps” in current humanitarian efforts.
He began his talk with a discussion on the history of humanitarianism, from its roots in the Red Cross and the Geneva Conventions to the proliferation of non-governmental organizations in the late 20th century.
“There is in the context of conflict an increasing role of non-governmental organizations playing a supposedly neutral humanitarian actor role to meet need when governments [or] war prevent delivery of systems,” he said.
Raymond then launched into the focus of his talk—how data and information technologies have transformed humanitarian responses.
Raymond said an increasing reliance on digital data to inform humanitarian responses have led to an uneven distribution of relief efforts. He spoke about seeing this “digital invisibility” first-hand in Biloxi, Mississippi after Hurricane Katrina, where white communities received more comprehensive aid than black communities.
“There was a racial and economic disparity in terms of how federal and state authorities were seeing the population based on whether or not they had barriers to their connectivity. For me, everything I’ve done in my life since then was really related to that moment,” Raymond said.
Raymond concluded his talk with a call to action for future leaders in law to address the problems regarding data and technology in humanitarianism.
Ying Li, a student at the Law School who attended the talk, reflected afterwards about the recent popularization of digital technology in humanitarian work.
“When I learned international humanitarian law, we covered how to coordinate all the resources from all the stakeholders, private and public, to better respond to crises," she said. "But back then, in 2013, we didn’t touch upon digital philanthropy."
Suchana Seth, a visiting fellow at the Berkman Klein Center, echoed similar thoughts on the role of technology in her work.
“As a data scientist and as a part of communities like that, I do see the transformative power of tech,” Seth said. “While I’m completely on board with the concerns that he was raising, I think [my] skepticism comes from the fact that I was hoping to see a lot of operationalization or actual standards that I was hoping he would talk about, whereas this was more of stating the premise.”

The Cambridge City Council voted Monday to approve a new MIT development that will include 280 affordable housing units near Kendall Square.
The proposal, presented at the Council’s Monday meeting, includes housing as well as commercial space, labs, and open plazas. According to information filed by the ordinance committee and planning boards, the redevelopment will including roughly 1,100 market rate housing units, 280 affordable housing units, and 950 new beds in graduate student housing.
The site will also include a community space with job search and training facilities, as well as community event planning and art installations. The overall goal of the project is “to create a dynamic mixed-use center in Kendall Square.”
MIT also has made a cash commitment of nearly a quarter of a billion dollars to the city as part of the agreement, according to Councillor Leland Cheung.
Presented alongside the petition, the City Planning Board included a letter to the Council encouraging them to adopt zoning changes to accommodate the housing development. Board members who wrote in support of the redevelopment called the project a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”
Councillors said the agreement is the culmination of months of negotiations. They say it addresses the city’s affordable housing crisis, which many say can be tied to a need for more graduate student housing in Cambridge.
“We wouldn’t have gotten to this point if we didn’t work together,” Councillor Dennis J. Carlone said. “It’s been a very positive process.”
“I think there’s a lot to be proud of, that many people have spoken to,” Councillor Nadeem Mazen added.
Carlone did not vote in favor of the proposal, expressing concerns that MIT could use the redevelopment project to use the buildings for education after 10 years, which would exempt them from commercial use and taxes. Councillors asked MIT representatives if removing this language would be possible before voting, but the request was ultimately denied. “That scares the heck out of me, from a fiscal point of view,” Carlone said.
Other topics discussed at the meeting included the increasing prevalence of helicopter noise over the city and how snow removal will be impacted by new traffic and bike infrastructure.

Faculty and students gathered at a panel event Tuesday to discuss how their work with Harvard’s Center for Hellenic Studies is helping to expand the University’s presence in Greece.
One of a series of events showcased during Harvard's Worldwide Week, the panel addressed the role of an international center in supporting Harvard’s global outreach efforts.
Founded in 1960, the Center for Hellenic Studies stands as a research and educational facility that brings together various research and teaching interests focusing on the Hellenic civilization.
Gregory Nagy, a professor of comparative literature and the director of the Center for Hellenic Studies, said the Center’s new initiatives are increasingly multifaceted, with emphasis on public service.
“We’re like a global version of the Phillips Brooks House Association,” Nagy said.
Nagy added that the Hellenic Center hopes to incorporate its academic pursuits with its public service aspirations by providing students with a chance to teach students in Greece.
“It’s really rewarding to become a mentor to students in Greece, and I still keep connections with them,” said Allison C. Toledo ’19, who participated in the Center's Teaching Internship Program.
Nicolas Prevelakis, a lecturer on Social Studies who moderated the event, said he is grateful for the University’s presence in Greece and the work it does for the community there.
“[The Hellenic Center] organizes lecture series and creates programs for high school and university students studying in Greece,” Prevelakis said. “The Greece office also serves as a safe space where people can come to talk about some of the greater issues facing the world.”
According to Prevelakis, the international office in Greece attracts thousands of visitors and is open every day.
Rhea K. Lesage, librarian for Hellenic Studies, said the Hellenic Center launched a new initiative last February to create an international collaboration between the National Library of Greece and the Harvard Library collection.

UPDATED: October 26, 2017 at 6:50 p.m.
As the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences looks to boost its recruiting profile for engineering jobs, SEAS students are flocking to project-based extracurricular groups to gain experience and professional connections.
The trend has contributed to significant growth in groups like the Harvard Undergraduate Robotics Club and Harvard's chapter of Engineers Without Borders in recent years.
From just five students in 2014, the Robotics Club’s enrollment ballooned to 101 this fall. Engineers without Borders expanded to 42 members in 2017 from 18 members in 2014.
Citing Cornell’s award-winning robotic submarine and MIT’s aerospace engineering groups,  Yankang Yang ’18, president of the Harvard College Engineering Society, said that other schools have more established engineering extracurricular groups that Harvard students are trying to “emulate.”
These project-based groups enable students to gain “hands-on experience they wouldn’t otherwise get,” said Niamh Mulholland ’19, co-president of the Robotics Club, noting that designing robots presents a welcome contrast from her mostly theoretical coursework.
Mulholland said working with teammates throughout the year—including over academic breaks—to build robots that fly or navigate mazes nurtures a strong sense of community and strengthens an engineering resume.
Nicole D. Trenchard ’19, co-lead of an Engineers Without Borders project, said her club affords her the opportunity to collaborate with peers on meaningful projects and receive feedback and mentorship from practicing engineers. The Engineers Without Borders chapter is partnered with the Boston Professional Chapter, whose members review student projects. Their current projects include a clean water system in the Dominican Republic and a schoolhouse in Tanzania.
“It’s a good challenge for us to remember that not only are we engineering students, but that we’re entering a world with real problems to solve—not necessarily p-set six, problem six,” Trenchard said.
SEAS Director of Experiential and Career Development Keith R. Karasek—an in-house career advisor dedicated to SEAS students—said engagement with practicing engineers is a great opportunity for students. Karasek highlighted the design review Elon Musk’s rocket company SpaceX conducted last year for the Robotics Club.
Daniel A. Galindo-Navarro ’18 said students seeking engineering jobs have to “do a lot more legwork” than those pursuing more institutionalized recruiting tracks in consulting, finance and tech.
In light of this trend, Mulholland said she appreciates that Karasek is ramping up efforts to connect with engineering companies and “encourage engineering students to apply for those [jobs] rather than go for software internships if that’s not something they want to do in the future.”
In his capacity as Career Outreach and Development Chair of the Engineering Society, Galindo-Navarro works with Karasek to host career advising workshops for students, where older students or professors can pass on their knowledge. Yang and Galindo-Navarro also both said alumni have been helpful in the job search process.
In hopes of placing more engineering students in internships related to their concentration, Karasek has sought to improve connections with national labs, such as the National Institute of Standards of Technology and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. On Nov. 15, Harvard will co-host the “Engineering Career Fair Collaborative” with several other Boston colleges and Yale.
Since some large engineering companies such as Apple do not yet recruit at Harvard, Karasek enrolls approximately 60 Harvard students in MIT's on-campus recruiting program every fall.
Yang said he hopes SEAS will continue to build official relationships with engineering employers.
“While it would be nice to have these resources in place—which HCES and SEAS are trying to do—a cool aspect of being in this community is that we are part of this build-up process,” Yang said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former New York Times Executive Editor Jill E. Abramson and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and novelist Lorraine Adams debated the power of storytelling and news writing Tuesday at the Barker Center.
The event's moderator, English lecturer and novelist Claire Messud, began the discussion by noting that both Abramson and Adams started out as journalists, but their career paths diverged when Adams switched to writing novels to focus more on individual narratives.
Adams said reporting on police shootings in her journalism helped her overcome an “intense shyness” that persisted from her childhood to young adulthood.
“I began to realize that [victims of police shootings] were my people,” Adams said. “They had been bullied, they had been silenced, they were powerless.”
For Abramson, an interest in writing began with observing investigative reporting on the Watergate scandal.
“My inspiration for going into journalism and digging for facts that were hard to get: Woodward and Bernstein,” Abramson said, referring to Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, two journalists who did much of the original reporting on the scandal.
“It was the unfolding story and the fact that there were always new chapters and new characters and new revelations, I just thought to be able to be involved in that would be amazing,” Abramson added.
The two speakers also discussed the importance of the media becoming more “in touch with genuinely new developments in society."
Abramson referenced Buzzfeed reporters as an example: “They want to connect and engage a younger audience in the news. Because of that effort, they are more in touch,” she said.
Abramson noted that the New York Times has made an effort to connect more with younger audiences through new initiatives.
“I think that for business reasons as well as journalistic reasons, the Times has kind of awakened to the new, and has become a lot less calcified than it was even when I first got there in 1997,” she said.
While Abramson said she remains a staunch believer in the power of the news, Adams said that the public’s thirst for sensational material prevents journalism from actually improving society.
“I think that the appetite for dull but worthy stories is in the toilet, and has always been in the toilet as long as I’ve been a journalist. People in the newsroom love to do them, we want to do them, and then they go out into the world and nothing changes,” said Adams. “I think that’s why I became increasingly dissatisfied with journalism.”
Abramson, however, noted that while specific situations might not change, people’s reactions to these topics do. Arguing that journalism is still a catalyst for change, Abramson said that while problems like sexual assault may never stop, news coverage of these events can help raise awareness of them.
“Things do change, and I think that journalism often ends up playing a salutary role in pushing about that change,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences ran a $9.1 million deficit in fiscal year 2017, a shortfall that made up the vast majority of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences total $11.7 million deficit.
The Dean’s Annual Report, released by FAS Dean Michael D. Smith earlier this month, revealed that FAS, Harvard’s largest division, has managed to reduce its deficit from $23 million in fiscal year 2016.
The report notes, however, that SEAS—which recently received a $400 million gift and is the fastest-growing school at Harvard—is largely responsible for the deficit. Together, costs associated with FAS’s three other divisions—Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences and Sciences—along with other expenses totaled only $2.6 million.
According to SEAS Dean Francis J. Doyle III, the higher deficit is attributable to the unique effects of the 2008 financial crisis that coincided with the launch of Harvard’s newest school.
“We had the double whammy of the downturn right as we were starting as a school,” Doyle said. “So right when you’re in start-up mode and needing resources and getting going, revenues collapsed, in terms of our endowment base.”
Harvard’s endowment, which suffered another year of “disappointing” returns in fiscal year 2017 amid dramatic restructuring efforts, is the single largest form of revenue for SEAS, according to Doyle.
“The Corporation has recognized that the endowment distribution bouncing around, especially with low numbers, is actually not conducive to keeping the excellence in our academic program,” Smith said in an interview earlier this month.
The Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, voted earlier this year to change its endowment distribution model and ensure that schools receive a funding increase every year. But despite poor endowment returns, Doyle remains optimistic that SEAS will run a surplus by the time the new Allston campus opens in 2020.
“Resources are strained,” Doyle said. “But in the past two years since I’ve been here we have reduced the deficit each of those successive years. So we have turned the tide.”
Harvard has placed a growing emphasis on SEAS in the past decade. The school has seen a near tripling of declared concentrators and a 30 percent growth in its faculty in the past ten years. The focus on SEAS has allowed the school to play an outsized role in the deficit for the past few years.
“We will think about what’s the most important intellectual advances we need to make and find money to put to them,” Smith said of the budgeting process.
SEAS's efforts to climb out of what Doyle referred to as a “fairly deep well” will be aided in large part by distributions from a $400 million donation from hedge fund magnate John A. Paulson in 2015.
“The beauty of the Paulson gift is that it is completely unrestricted, but the Paulson gift is coming in in stages,” Doyle said. “So we haven’t appreciated the impact and for some years won’t appreciate the full impact. But it will absolutely be a piece of continuing to move the needle in the right direction.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dozens of educators, researchers, and students gathered at the Graduate School of Education Tuesday to discuss research on school choice in New York City public schools.
Princeton sociology professor Jennifer L. Jennings headlined the event, the second installment in the Center for Education Policy Research public seminar series. Jennings’s research focuses on finding a way to level the playing field in New York City’s school matching program—since 2004, eighth graders in the city have been required to rank their preferred high schools, a program that Jennings and other have found to lead to disparate educational outcomes.
Jennings said that her findings contradict the “assumption that kids are trapped in local neighborhoods”: In fact, she said, students from lower-income neighborhoods tend to travel farther for school. Instead, inequalities arise when those lower-income families don’t have sufficient information to choose the best schools for their children, Jennings said.
“I think there’s an assumption that people have information about schools and how they’re different, and there’s an assumption that families—between working, taking care of kids, getting through the day—have the time, resources, and ability to really navigate a complex process,” Jennings said in an interview.
Miriam Greenberg, the director of education and communications at the CEPR, said Jennings’s research demonstrated how “choice systems, charter or not, are very complex and that some students have a harder time knowing how to navigate those systems.”
Greenberg said doctoral students in the educational research fellowship program had indicated their enthusiasm for hearing about Jennings's work.
“She did a lot of public writing about education before she became a scholar, so I think that she is an interesting figure because she’s really thinking about research through a practitioner’s lense,” Greenberg said of Jennings.
Jennings said that her interest in the subject stemmed from her graduate school studies, during which she identified significant inequalities in the school choice system. In sharing her most recent research with scholars at the Ed School, Jennings said, “A goal is to try to convey the results that we have to date and to get feedback on those results, so it’s very much a two way process.”
The next speaker in the CEPR’s seminar series will be Bridget Terry Long, a professor at the Ed School who will deliver a public lecture on November 7.
“We brought people here because we just really want to make sure that the public is able to interact with the research and see how that research applies back into their districts,” said Greenberg.

English singer, composer, and activist Elton H. John will receive the 2017 Harvard University Humanitarian of the Year award, the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations announced Tuesday morning.
Known for his award-winning work in the music industry—including hits like “Rocket Man” and “Tiny Dancer”—John will be recognized for his work as founder of the Elton John AIDS Foundation. Since its inception in 1992, the foundation has raised more than $385 million to fund prevention and treatment efforts of HIV/AIDS and advocate for those affected.
This isn't the first time John has been lauded for his charity: Queen Elizabeth II knighted him in 1998, and the Rockefeller Foundation gave him its Lifetime Achievement Award in 2013.
John was inducted into the Songwriter’s Hall of Fame in 1992, and his numerous other accolades include five Grammys, a Golden Globe, a Tony, and an Academy Award.
“Accepting an award like this is both gratifying and tremendously humbling," John wrote in a press release.  "I am grateful to Harvard University and the Harvard Foundation for acknowledging my philanthropic work toward ending HIV/AIDS. It's an honor to share this recognition with such illustrious past recipients.”
John joins a dazzling collection of previous Humanitarian Award recipients including Malala Yousafzai, Hans Rosling, and, most recently, Rihanna. He will be honored on Nov. 6 with a ceremony in Sanders Theatre. Tickets will become available for in-person pickup starting on Nov. 2.

When Christopher P. Barry needed help with his high school graduation speech, he knew exactly who to call: Alexander H. Patel ’17-’18.
Twenty minutes later, Patel showed up at Barry’s door. The two grabbed Barry’s dog and spent the next couple hours wandering around the neighborhood, talking “back and forth” until Barry finalized the speech in his head.
“He was an unbelievable friend, and he never hesitated to bring me into his life or to be generous with his time,” Barry said. “He was the friend I was most sure was going to do amazing things.”
This generosity and willingness to help a friend, Harvard peers and professors say, was typical of Patel, a Harvard senior who died recently, aged 22. According to the Middlesex County District Attorney’s Office, no “foul play” is suspected in his death; a spokesperson for the Massachusetts Office of the Chief Medical Examiner said authorities are still determining the cause of death.
Those who knew him remember Patel, a Philosophy and Mathematics concentrator, as a brilliant student with wide intellectual interests ranging from computer science to ancient Greek classics. Classmates said Patel loved to teach others—both formally, as a Teaching Fellow for various Computer Science classes, and informally, during dining hall conversations and over coffee-fueled debates at Dunkin’ Donuts.
Students and professors also remember Patel as a devoted friend and family member: someone who drove his sister to school every day in high school, someone willing to help debug friends’ code at 3 a.m.
“He was also one of the most emotionally intelligent kids I’ve ever met,” Barry said. “If I had a bad day, he’d swing by in this old red Subaru that he loved—and at times, hated—and take me to Chick-Fil-A and make me forget that my problems existed.”
“He always knew the right thing to say,” Barry added.
Patel grew up in Denver, Colo., and attended a highly competitive college prep school, according to Barry. Barry and Sam Mathews, another high school friend, say Patel distinguished himself as an exceptional student early on: He took an unusually large course load and wrote “brilliant” essays, all while playing goalkeeper for the varsity lacrosse team, competing on the debate team, running Model United Nations conferences, and tutoring classmates in mathematics.
Nonetheless, Patel found time to pursue side projects and personal interests. He studied Lacanian psychoanalysis, learning more about the subject “than any other teenager I have ever met,” Barry said. In his spare time, Patel also developed scheduling software his high school still uses, according to Barry.
Steven S. Lee ’16, a Harvard friend of Patel’s and a former President of The Crimson, said Patel’s passion for side projects continued into college.
“He always had these side projects, he was always so driven and so interested in grabbing whoever was next to him to talk to them about it,” Lee said. “One time, he just started talking about how the United States collects weather data—he had this thought about how to [do it better], and he just went on and on about it.”
As he did in high school, Patel kept a packed schedule at Harvard. In addition to taking a full course load, Patel worked as a teaching fellow for various Computer Science classes, conducted research in a lab run by Computer Science professor Margo I. Seltzer ’83, and held an “IT consulting gig on the side,” according to Barry.
Patel also wrote for The Crimson, covering Harvard Business School and serving on the paper’s data analysis team. He won a national award for a data-based story on Harvard faculty political donations.
“He contributed so much to the organization, it probably wouldn’t have been the same without him,” Lee said.
In the months before he died, Patel was working to finish his thesis project—an “intellectually ambitious” attempt to increase the precision of philosophical language through computer technology, according to Patel’s thesis advisor and mathematical logic professor Warren Goldfarb.
Patel was also applying to Ph.D. programs in computer science, applied math, and business, Barry said. And he was planning to learn Greek, according to Harvard friend and former Crimson editor Theodore R. Delwiche ’17-’18.
“I was so sure that he was going to do something tremendous in life,” Lee said. “I really felt like he was one of those people where I thought, 20 years down the line, he really would have made just a ton of impact in the world.”
Seltzer agreed.
“That was our Alex—clever, funny, ambitious, smart, motivated,” she said. “When Alex said he would do something, he did it and he did it well. We [at the lab] will miss him terribly—his warmth, his smile, his way of making everyone around him just a little bit better.”
In wake of Patel’s death, friends say they remember—and miss—the little things. Lee recalled how Patel laughed with “his whole body.” Barry said he will never forget Patel’s penchant for coming up with “quirky catchphrases” that “nobody else in the world could pull off.”
Mathews, Patel’s high school friend, said he can’t stop thinking about the day Patel got into Harvard. Mathews said Patel pushed himself in high school, and that he didn’t get much sleep—but on this day, “nothing mattered.”
Patel opened his acceptance email while sitting in a computer science classroom. Afterward, Mathews and Patel got into Patel’s car—the red Subaru, nicknamed “the Buru”—and drove toward the Rocky Mountains.
On the drive, “neither of us spoke,” Mathews said. “Alex stared off into the horizon, watching the Rockies unfold before him as his newfound future had in that classroom.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following Saturday’s heartbreaking defeat to No. 14 Princeton, No. 16 Harvard returned to action to face off against No. 21 Boston University on Tuesday afternoon. In a thrilling contest, the Crimson (11-4, 4-1 Ivy League) defeated the Terriers (10-7, 5-0 Patriot League), 2-1, at Berylson Field.
Playing so soon after its most emotional game of the season, Harvard knew that it would need to regain some of the momentum it had lost over the weekend. The team would have to show its resiliency if it wanted to compete with yet another ranked opponent.
“After that loss against Princeton, we lost an emotional part of our team,” sophomore midfielder Bente van Vlijmen said. “We wanted to stop thinking about what we could have done. BU is a ranked opponent, so we knew we would have to focus to give them our best effort.”
After being shut out on Saturday, Harvard began Tuesday’s game with a flurry of efforts on net. The Crimson fired off four shots in the opening five minutes of the contest. By the sixth minute, those attempts paid off. With six minutes on the clock, freshman forward Mimi Tarrant sent a pass to sophomore midfielder Casey Allen, whose shot beat the BU goalkeeper for the score. The goal was Allen’s first of her career for the Crimson. The Berwyn, Pa. native is more generally known for creating chances than converting them, as is evidenced by her six assists on the season.
However, the Terriers were not deterred by Harvard’s early goal. Just three minutes later, BU would respond with a goal of its own, as Terriers freshman forward Petra Hall scored off of a redirection by junior forward Kara Enoch in front of the Crimson net. The goal marked a shift in the momentum of the game, as Harvard was pushed back onto the defensive. BU ended the half with four unanswered shots, but none of them found the back of the net, and the two teams ended the half tied at 1-1.
“They’re a very fast, very opportunistic team,” van Vlijmen said. “But we maintained our structure and our forwards were strong in finishing with the ball.”
Harvard began the second half with a more methodical approach, choosing quality over quantity in terms of its shots. This strategy paid off in the 45th minute, as co-captain Hannah Wellington weaved through several defenders into the circle before beating the BU goalkeeper for the score. The goal was Wellington’s seventh of the season and the 17th of her career.
Wellington’s tally served as a catalyst for the Crimson offense, as the team would go on to outshoot the Terriers, 4-1, over the next 15 minutes of game time. While Harvard did not manage to add to its lead, it did force BU junior goalkeeper Kathleen Keegan into making a number of impressive saves. Having taken over from freshman goalie Millie Baker at the start of the second half, Keegan finished the night with two saves. Baker tallied two stops of her own in the first period.
With time winding down, the Terriers decided to pull their goalkeeper in the 64th minute, in hopes of pulling a goal back. In the 67th minute, Wellington found herself with the ball and a chance to add to her goal tally, but saw her shot on net sail wide.
In the closing moments of the game, BU found one last chance to pull even. In the 69th minute, BU forward Petra Hall fired a shot on net, but junior goalkeeper Libby Manela made the save to seal the victory for the Crimson. The save was Manela’s fifth of the day, and the victory saw the junior improve her record on the season to 4-4. The Houston, Texas native has wracked up 66 total saves over the course of her collegiate career.
Following today’s action, Harvard returns to Ivy League play this weekend as it hosts Dartmouth on Saturday. The Crimson will hope to translate Tuesday’s win into momentum as it takes on the Big Green in the final home game of Harvard’s season. The Crimson also remains hopeful of its chance to compete in the NCAA playoffs. Currently, Princeton sits in the poll position atop the Ivy League, while Harvard remains close behind in second place.
“We are hopefully still in the race for NCAA’s,” van Vlijmen said. “We had to win this game in order to get into the top 16 teams in the country. Playing so well as a unit restored our faith in ourselves, and we hope that we get the chance to prove that we are a great team, that we should have beaten Princeton.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In three Ivy League matches, this Columbia football team has achieved something no other Lions squad in the last five years could do in an entire season—it’s won three games. Sitting at 3-0, the team can outdo its win total from each of the last 20 seasons with one more victory.
The undefeated record is enough to put Columbia atop the division, a place where it has only finished once before. The Lions’ ascent to the forefront of the Ivy League began two seasons ago with the recruitment of head coach Al Bagnoli. Now in his 26th year in the league, the veteran spent 23 seasons at Penn, a majority of his coaching tenure.
As the Quakers head coach, Bagnoli racked up a 112-49 conference record in addition to nine division championship rings. After a 2-8 season in 2014, Bagnoli retired. Then he didn’t. He returned to coaching to lead a Columbia group that had gone 0-7 that same year. With nowhere to go but up, the Lions have consistently improved since that rock-bottom season. Bagnoli’s first campaign in New York mirrored his last in Pennsylvania, 2-8. Last year, Columbia went 3-7. Now it sits perfect, 6-0.
To claim six wins, the Lions have beaten some of the best teams in the conference. With four schools—Yale, Cornell, Dartmouth, and Princeton—tied for second place with 2-1 records, the latter two can attribute their lone division loss to the Lions. The same Tigers team that dropped 52 points on Harvard fell to Columbia at home.
Still, the Ancient Eight crown is anything but guaranteed.
One test will come this weekend, when the Lions take on the Bulldogs, one of the two 2-1 teams that they have yet to beat. Columbia is favored to win, but not by much. Yale’s one conference loss came against Dartmouth, when the Big Green overcame a 21-point deficit to win by one. That same Dartmouth team fell by five points in its matchup with the Lions.
Moreover, Yale and Columbia share wins over Penn, though the Lions’ came in overtime and the Bulldogs took their game by five. Spanning its three conference matchups, Columbia’s margin of victory totals 12 points. All of this is to say that a Yale victory on Saturday would not be surprising.
A win for the Bulldogs this weekend would tie them for the top spot in the division, leading to a shared championship, supposing both teams win out. Even Princeton can get a share of the trophy if Yale tops the Lions and then the Tigers beat the Bulldogs and the rest of their opponents. Dartmouth still controls its fate, as well. The Big Green has a shot if it wins out and someone, anyone, beats Columbia. Cornell also remains in the running, and a matchup with the Lions still looms toward the latter end of its season.
Even the Crimson, despite receiving a 52-17 thrashing at the hands of Princeton, has a path to the championship trophy. Supposing Yale wins every game but “The Game,” and Harvard wins out—downing Columbia along the way, the Crimson, Lions, Bulldogs and others could all share top conference honors.
However, the chances of that happening are very slim. The last time a team won the Ivy League title with two losses was 1982, when Harvard, the Quakers, and Big Green all tied at 5-2 with four other teams tied for fourth with 3-4 records.
In last place, Penn does not have a shot at the top spot, but the team does have a chance to ruin someone else’s season. The team is a lot better than its 0-3 record would portray. The Quakers lost to the league-leader in overtime and suffered two other defeats—to Dartmouth and Yale—by a combined eight points. Penn is grasping for its first win and will likely get it this week against the Bears. The Quakers hope to play spoiler against their three final opponents—the Tigers, Crimson, and Big Red.
In other words, everything is up for grabs right now. This weekend will go a long way in determining who can muster the strength to advance a viable campaign.
The remaining path to the title game may be toughest for Harvard. The Crimson must still face two of the 2-1 teams—the Bulldogs and Big Green—in addition to Columbia and the Quakers.
The Lions, on the other hand, have a historically easy last two games of the season against Cornell and Brown. Typically, in past seasons, correspondents have paid attention to these last two games to see if the program will be able to pick up its first win of the season. This year, assuming Columbia continues to win, those last two matchups will determine whether the Ancient Eight crown is heading back to New York City for only the second time ever and for the first time since 1961.

Depending on your concentration, midterms are either almost over or nearing completion, but the tears are most definitely not. What better way to wallow in self-pity than to binge-watch a new TV show?
Here’s a suggestion: Suits

 Set in New York City, the series explores the journey of a normal guy, Mike Ross, as he finesses his way into a respectable law firm (which only hires graduates of Harvard Law) and becomes an associate for arguably the best lawyer in the city. And by finesse, we mean he pretends to be a Harvard grad when he’s actually a college dropout. As Harvard students plagued with imposter-syndrome, we’re all too familiar with the mantra "fake it till you make it."
If you think that everything in life will be smooth sailing because you’re going to end up with a Harvard degree, well…think again. Even if you get your hands on a pretty decent job, Suits shows how your “bright” Harvard self can be overrated in the real world. The producers consistently parody the life of a typical Harvard grad, especially the job application process. Picture a dozen or so folks wearing the same exact suit and tie, all lined up to kiss the interviewer’s tush, anxiously reciting their resumes which list about a trillion different activities. Sound familiar?
After reading all of this, we're pretty confident in saying that if this show suits you, or at least some of you, watch. We could all use a reality check about life outside the bubble.
