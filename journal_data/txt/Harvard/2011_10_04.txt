October 6-8, 8:00 p.m.
Adams Pool Theatre
Directed by Andy J. Boyd ’14
Produced by Katherine L. Price ’14 and Aly G. Martinez ’13
“Affordable Rates and Color TV” isn’t an extravagant show. On the contrary, it takes its staging cues from the plot’s run-down setting and uses its focus and streamlined dialogue to speak volumes more than an elaborate production could. The playwright and director, Andy J. Boyd ’14, used his own childhood living in Phoenix, Ariz. as inspiration to set the play in the more desperate parts of the American Southwest, areas made progressively more irrelevant by the decline of Route 66. “It’s a place where people live and where people make their home,” Boyd says on the play’s setting of a rundown motel, “but it’s also a place that implies change.”
Change is one of the key topics in “Affordable Rates and Color TV,” as protagonist Kim has to decide what she wants to do with the rest of her life: either run her family’s motel or leave Prescott for good. “I think this is a theme a lot of people our age grapple with, this ‘How do you become who you think you should become?’” Boyd says. Stage Manager Alice Li ’13 adds, “It feels so sad to realize that this is something that could happen in the present day, the feeling of being stuck in this deserted, not-that-great place.” The atmosphere of captivity is augmented by the play’s staging, which is confined to a single room which characters enter and exit throughout. The limited set also implies a wider problem: this play is just one small vignette in a much larger narrative of anxiety and loneliness in Prescott, Ariz.
The unstable Arizonan background reflects the chaotic trajectory of the lead character’s life, caught between her responsibilities and her dreams of freedom. Mary C. Hallowell ’14 takes the role of Kim, the 17-year-old motel manager, opposite William D. Kehler ’12 as her overbearing 23-year-old boyfriend Scott. Hallowell says of her character, “She has a lot of issues with her mom and her dad just isn’t a presence ... so I think of all the relationships that I had to think about that was the toughest one, just because that’s really ingrained in her.” The character of Kim is both easily recognizable and quickly relatable. Her struggles reflect the same anxieties all young adults share about what it means to grow up.

William Shakespeare’s “Twelfth Night” is a complex play, full of gender mix-ups, mistaken identities, and other deceptions. The Actors’ Shakespeare Project’s production of the play, playing at the Plaza Theater at the Boston Center for the Arts until October 22, ends up just as confused as some of the characters. There is some strong acting, most notably by Doug Lockwood as Sir Andrew Aguecheek and James Andreassi as Sir Toby Belch. But the actors alone cannot save a maddeningly inconsistent production, which awkwardly wavers between camp, comedy, and drama.
The dramatic elements are by far the weakest part of this production, perhaps unsurprising given that the play was originally written as a “twelfth night entertainment”—an amusing piece meant to be performed on the last night of the Christmas holiday. “Twelfth Night” focuses on the twins Viola and Sebastian, who are shipwrecked before the play begins. To get by in a new land, Viola pretends to be a man, leading to much confusion at the court of Illyria. There is an extended subplot focusing on pranks coordinated by the drunken Sir Toby and Sir Andrew. The premise is inherently absurd, which means that any attempt to inject a more serious tone is liable to come at the expense of the comedy.
The production’s solemn attitude becomes most obnoxious toward the end; the extended denouement of the play, which should be filled with comic frenzy, is anemic and tired. Sebastian and Viola’s reunion is an oddly somber affair, from the actors’ flat delivery to the gloomy, minimal lighting. Marianna Bassham, who plays Viola, loses a lot of her appeal once she stops being able to make hilarious facial expressions.
At the same time, these dramatic sequences are marred by a sense of pretension. Director Melia Bensussen includes extended scenes where Allyn Burrows, playing the servant Malvolio, sits in a pit of sand while images of galaxies are projected behind him. It’s an unexpected choice that’s technically well executed but adds little artistically. These technical flourishes are at odds with the play’s minimal set and odd soundtrack, which consists in part of listless, high-pitched drones. Judging from the director’s notes, these elements are supposed to help us consider the questions of identity and unrequited love that exist in the play; instead, they distract from the action and cause the production yet more internal dissonance.
With all these issues to think about, it’s easy to forget that this is indeed a comedy—and when the actors get to cut loose, the production is most enjoyable. Burrows brings a clever self-importance to his Malvolio, while Lockwood and Andreassi’s drunken cadences are responsible for the production’s funniest and least thematically weighty moments. Even the spare art direction and costumes add to the production in these sequences; the choice to dress Andreassi in a beat up t-shirt both suits his character and contrasts nicely with his more formally attired fellows.
But there is a troubling problem with these comedic sequences—they shift uncomfortably between the comedy that Shakespeare intended and a metatheatrical parody of it. At times, “Twelfth Night” verges on camp; the actors say their lines with a wink, getting laughs from the dated language. At one point, Lockwood grasps a female actress’s bosom and quickly fist pumps. That moment, more than anything else, exemplifies the broadly mocking tone that dominates at times. The actors are more comfortable in the comedic tone, but they are left unable to embrace it wholeheartedly by the dramatic emphasis of the production as a whole.
It’s this lack of thematic, tonal, and technical unity that defines the entire production; there are many different possibilities being pursued, but none are fully developed. The pretentious drama doesn’t overwhelm the comedy, but the comic elements aren’t solid enough to make the drama worthwhile. With more focus, perhaps this production could have been a successful reimagining of “Twelfth Night,” one full of high camp and heightened drama that also managed to say something interesting about sexuality and identity. But perhaps that is too much to ask of a simple twelfth night’s entertainment.

Family dynamics are never clean or fixed. They are messy and complex, pulsing with a lifetime of emotions and expectations past, present, and future. The upcoming release “The Way” brims over with these sorts of familial interactions, both on film and behind the scenes. The movie tells the story of a father who leaps out of his comfort zone to fulfill the last dream of his suddenly deceased son, and who rebuilds his own life through the process. The tale is masterfully told through the performances of a real-life father-and-son duo—Martin Sheen, who stars as the father, and Emilio Estevez, who plays the son and directs his own father’s touching performance.
The film opens with a scene out of every parent’s worst nightmare: Sheen’s character, Dr. Tom Avery, receives a call informing him that his son has been killed in a freak weather accident in France. Tom flashes back to a previous conversation with his son, Daniel, right before he left for Europe. We overhear the all too believable exchange, in which the father screams at his son, “When are you going to finish your education?” to which the son retorts that he has decided to give up his PhD in favor of travelling the world.
Back in the present, the film poignantly captures the father’s awkwardness in the face of his immense loss. He does not know how to speak to people or how to react when he sees his son in a body bag. In an uncharacteristically impulsive move, Tom, a retired ophthalmologist more comfortable on a California golf course than in the wild, decides to embark on an 800-kilometer pilgrimage through Spain—on the famed Camino De Santiago trail—carrying his son’s ashes as a last gift to his son, who had hoped to complete this journey. While meeting the other pilgrims on this solitary trek, Tom rediscovers himself and the memory of Daniel, and finally comes to terms with the life of his late estranged son.
Of course, as close collaborators on “The Way,” Sheen and Estevez do not have the same type of estranged relationship as the father and son in their film. They banter together, expressing pride in each other’s skill. The elder Sheen even attributes the depth of his own performance—his character transforms from an unhappy loner on a tragic mission to the mainstay of a group of pilgrims, with a physical journey that mirrors his spiritual one—to the skill of his son. With some pride, Sheen tells how “Emilio found a way to make Tom’s journey equally a physical adventure and an inner quest.”
As for Estevez, he was determined to have his father play the leading role in the film, which he wrote and directed. “Even when we were struggling to get this movie made, there was never any question about Martin being Tom. The role was created for him and I certainly didn’t want to be on the Camino de Santiago without him,” he says. The actors’ real-world generation-spanning relationship offers a taste of what Tom finally finds on his pilgrimage—a deeper, if posthumous, bond between father and son.
Sheen and Estevez admit that they originally thought that their film would only appeal to, as they called it, “the AARP generation.” But they were delighted when test groups of younger audiences responded to both the exotic lure of the Camino trail and the emotional draw of the film’s internal redemptive quest. The lesson of a road-trip movie—that one must sometimes undertake a journey not for the sake of another person or a destination, but to find one’s self—is, they conclude, one with an appeal for all ages.

“Sad,” “depressing,” “hopeful,” and “uplifting,” are all words usually associated with films about cancer. When tackling such a devastating subject, Hollywood seems to prefer to create either spiritual movies about the transformational nature of illness or emotional tear-jerkers that remind us how close we all are to death’s door. But although “50/50” on occasion veers into this saccharine territory, it mostly treads a less beaten path—reality.
Cancer does not pick its victims in a regular or expected manner; so too, Joseph Gordon-Leavitt’s Adam is an upstanding citizen who does not drink or smoke, exercises, and works at the local radio station. When the doctor tells him that his back pain is actually a rare and possibly deadly tumor, Adam has a justifiably horrified and confused reaction. His terror at the matter is all the more powerful due to the movie’s credible portrayal of what happens next.
Numbness sets in. For most of the film,  Adam seems blank with shock. The most frequently uttered words in the whole movie are “I’m fine.” If nothing else, “50/50” should be applauded for giving the audience a realistic, if oversimplified, version of the process that too many people endure. The uninitiated public often thinks of cancer as the tragically slow and painful end of older people’s lives, not a disease that afflicts people in their prime. Moreover, all too often a movie with a young, cancer-stricken protagonist goes the way of “A Walk to Remember” and forgets that in the vigor of youth, the young cannot even process their diagnosis. “50/50” offers a much-needed corrective to these traditional misperceptions.
The movie also does some justice to the feelings of Adam’s friends and family. As those who have gone through the experience understand, it is often not the cancer patient’s own reaction that is particularly painful to observe, but the reactions of those around him or her. In this respect, Anjelica Huston brings real sensitivity to the part of Adam’s mother, Diane, who already bears the burden of a husband with Alzheimer’s. Indeed, compared to Adam’s girlfriend Rachael—played with frighteningly cold effectiveness by Bryce Dallas Howard—and Anna Kendrick’s sweet, spacey therapist character, the only woman of any depth in the film is the possessive, clingy, loving mother.
While “50/50” has elements of both romance and buddy comedy, the reality of cancer still looms in the background. Although Kyle (Seth Rogen), Adam’s best friend, manages to pick up girls using Adam’s cancer as a sympathetic hook, screenwriter Will Reiser’s low-key, natural dialogue and storyline in many ways share more DNA with a Lifetime movie than with typical Seth Rogen fare.
Reiser does a beautiful job of exploring each kind of traditional reaction to cancer–the worrying mother, the careless friend, the awkward coworkers. Here, Adam’s two older chemo buddies (Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer) are an unfortunately clichéd addition to a cast that is otherwise fresher and younger. But as hackneyed as the two may be, they are a welcome relief from some of the film’s other characters. Though an excellent actress, Kendrick comes off as insincere in her role as Adam’s romantic interest, as if she was playing dress-up or awkwardly walking into the middle of someone else’s conversation. Her character belongs only in the rom-com portion of “50/50,” and the moments when she enters the rest of the film’s more serious sections are uncomfortable and shallow.
The main failing of “50/50,” however, lies in its predictable storyline—from the film’s charming background music to the adorable relationship Adam begins with his therapist, the movie makes it all too clear for the attentive viewer where Adam’s story will ultimately end. There are some tonal issues as well; for a movie daring enough to title itself “50/50”—the rather disheartening odds of survival for Adam—Seth Rogen-style weed humor feels a little forced. Ultimately, the movie would be more compelling if, as Adam says to his therapist, people would stop saying that “it’s all fine… [because] it’s not!” But only in some of its final scenes does “50/50” approach that harsher reality.
That said, the power of “50/50” still lies in its juxtaposition of those stark odds with a much more varied range of emotional responses to them. If this were any ordinary movie about cancer, it would become clear early on that Adam has two choices in regards to his sickness: he can be a pessimist or an optimist about his chances and daily life. Instead, Reiser reminds us that people are not that monochromatic, and that every cancer victim, family member, and friend struggles daily with the harrowing pronouncement: “I think I’m starting to realize that I’m going to die.” Because of this, while the movie is not for someone who has lost someone to cancer—it is far too positive to be cathartic—it does tell the honest story of someone who survived.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a familiar story. A bunch of preppy college kids—guys wearing popped collars and backwards caps, girls wearing things that barely count as clothes—road-trip it into the wilderness for a weekend of mildly debaucherous drunken frolic. But things start to get weird after a few ominous incidents: an encounter with a duo of menacing hillbillies at a gas station, a wide-eyed sheriff warning them that nothing good ever happens ’round these parts. Sure enough, a little innocent skinny dipping sees one of the girls kidnapped by—who else?—the same hillbillies from the gas station. And one by one, the rest of the kids start dying in brutal fashion as they try to save their friend.
Nothing new to see here. It’s all been done to death.
Except in this movie, the menacing hillbillies who kidnap the girl are Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine). And they are the kind of hillbillies who eat pickled eggs and soothe their bee stings with Pabst Blue Ribbon, not the kind who commit serial murder. They didn’t actually kidnap Allison (Katrina Bowden)—she hit her head and they took her to their cabin to tend to her. And the college kids aren’t being murdered, they’re haplessly offing themselves by accident while attempting to save Allison from the guys who aren’t actually trying to kill any of them.
So begins the big mess of blood, guts, and irony that is “Tucker and Dale vs. Evil.” The movie does for teenage slasher films what “Zombieland” and “Shaun of the Dead” did for apocalyptic zombie films: it celebrates what makes the genre great while mercilessly parodying it. The result is a movie that never takes itself too seriously but also never feels like a joke.
While the movie bills itself as a comedy-horror film, this classification is a bit misleading—there is much less horror and much more humor in the movie. For most of its runtime, “Tucker and Dale vs. Evil” ingeniously takes the things that make slasher films so fun and preserves them within the framework of a masterfully penned comedy of errors.
The fact that this plot is pretty predictable—and the fact that most of the movie’s biggest violent shockers are in the trailer—doesn’t mean armrests won’t be gripped through explosions of laughter. The mounting tension of the horror genre is still present within the satire, as is the gruesome imagery.
But more importantly, “Tucker and Dale vs. Evil” is funny as hell. The writers mostly eschew the quick, corny one-liners that so often make an otherwise great scene cringe-worthy and instead opt for much more entertaining situational irony. This is not to say that you won’t wince on occasion—some of the movie’s funniest moments depend on making the viewer very, very uncomfortable. But it’s did-that-really-just-happen uncomfortable, not give-me-my-money-back uncomfortable.
Much of the movie’s humor comes from the dynamic between Tudyk and Labine as Tucker and Dale. The two actors play off each other fantastically, and the awkwardly endearing redneck bromance radiates from the screen as the two try desperately to avoid being killed by the college students. And while their dialogue could easily have been delivered in a way that would have made the characters just two more annoying hillbillies, Tudyk and Labine bring an earnestness and candor to the roles that makes them genuinely likable.
Indeed, performances in the film are all around effective. Even the actors playing the college kids bring depth where it is warranted. Notable in this regard is Chad (Jesse Moss), the ringleader of the group, who is the kind of kid who takes a hit from a joint and then another one from his inhaler. As the film’s hero-turned-villain, Moss brings to the role a wonderfully campy machismo. And Katrina Bowden plays the well-meaning but slightly patronizing Allison with a well balanced mix of beauty-pageant treacle and genuine heart.
“Tucker and Dale vs. Evil” stumbles a bit in its attempts to humanize some of these characters, and the plot twist at its end is underwhelming. But these are trivial flaws compared to its successes. And it even sends a nice message to us hyper-judgmental college kids: Don’t jump to conclusions. If you do, you might end up face-first in a wood chipper.

With a title as canny as “Machine Gun Preacher,” Marc Forster’s film has surprisingly little to do with the grindhouse genre it evokes. Rather than dabbling in camp or irony, “Machine Gun Preacher” is instead an exercise in full-blown Hollywood mediocrity—a dull drama of big-budget sentimentality. It’s a shame too, considering the potential of the film’s larger-than-life premise.
“Machine Gun Preacher” is based on the borderline-surreal story of Sam Childers (Gerard Butler), a reformed convict and former heroin dealer who found the Christian faith and then moved to Sudan to found an orphanage and battle child-abducting guerillas. However, the mystique of the character of Childers and his story quickly dissolves, as the film instead refocuses on the man playing him. For Butler, coming from previous films like “300,” “Law Abiding Citizen,” and “The Ugly Truth,” being cast in such a humanitarian role could have been an inspired opportunity for more nuanced performance. Yet after watching “Machine Gun Preacher,” it is hard to conceive of the film as anything but another Gerard Butler action vehicle.
And a vehicle it is—as a biopic, “Preacher” covers a lot of ground rapidly, all with Butler on screen for what feels like 90 percent of the time. Too often the movie plays as a listless montage for the transformation of Butler’s character. The film begins with a Mad-Max-dressed Butler almost parodically spouting quotes as awful as “You’re a fuckin’ junkie stripper and you know it!” to his patient wife Lynn (Michelle Monaghan). Soon enough, the gangster finds God and becomes a venerable father wearing crisp button-ups, and not long after he arrives in Sudan. There Childers juggles the responsibilities of his humanitarian work and his merciless hunting of members of the Lord’s Resistance Army.
None of this is to say that Gerard Butler is the reason why the movie is so inauspiciously bland. As the upright yet steely and resourceful alpha male hero, Butler is adept at engaging our sympathies. Rather, at the core of the movie’s malaise are the completely ludicrous scenarios and characters with which Butler has to work. The script, written by Jason Keller, does not do justice to the complicated dimensions and trials of Sam Childers’ mission, nor to Sudan’s bleak history in general. And for an action number, the film has a plenitude of lethargic scenes, many of which seem to exist purely as set-up for individual overwrought one-liners—Hollywood cant like “You’re a mercenary, not a humanitarian!”
Adding to the movie’s misadventures in tone, director Forster occasionally attempts to imbed facile social commentary about modern standards of living and consumption within “Machine Gun Preacher.” The scenes of Sudan are contrasted to back-home Pennsylvania, where Monaghan walks through fluorescent aisles of uniformly arrayed food at a supermarket. At one point, the Childers family attends an opulent fundraising party in a McMansion and the wealthy host snubs Butler’s cause by contributing a paltry $150 instead of the $2,000 requested. Enraged, Butler goes on to deliver a line so wooden for a sentiment so obvious that it is unintentionally hilarious: “$150? He spent more on salsa for his party!” These on-the-nose attempts at modern moralizing fail for the same reason as the rest of the film—its plodding approach squanders the premise’s potential.
Ultimately, convoluted drama and ponderous monotony kill “Machine Gun Preacher.” It is a movie without style or an idea of style. While the film teases viewers with the promise of multiple genres—biopic, documentary, action thriller—it forgoes them all, providing only mechanical and formulaic point A–to-B cinema. Even the title itself is a deception—for a film portending significant deployment of automatic weapons, there is actually very little gun-slinging, and those expecting a very gung-ho and kinetic film will be disappointed. Indeed, “Machine Gun Preacher” is not a movie for people who want an over-the-top military thriller, nor is it for people seeking an ethically and emotionally dynamic true story. It is more for people who want the pretense of one of those things, while Gerard Butler yells things like “I’m gonna get the kids! Cover me!”
Perhaps the most compelling part of “Machine Gun Preacher” comes during its credits, when actual footage of the real Sam Childers is shown. The man is intriguing and older, with large pistols holstered next to his great paunch. He seems a lot humbler than the chiseled, bear-like Butler. One can’t help but wonder if there were a better movie to be made here—if 15 minutes of a documentary on Childers could have been infinitely more fascinating and thrilling than this flaccid half-fiction.

“I crave white on white and black, but my thoughts race in glorious technicolor, prodding me awake, whipping away the warm blanket of invisibility every time it swears to smother my mind in nothing,” proclaims a character named “C” (Mariel N. Pettee ’14) in Sarah Kane’s “Crave.” Kane’s play mimics this dilemma in its dialogue: the characters speak almost entirely in black and white one-line phrases, with no poetic descriptions and no flourishes, reveling in anonymity and confusion. Yet now and again a burning description lights up the play’s world—as well as our own—and forces us to see its desperate isolation, hidden pain, and unrealized desire.
“Crave,” which runs until October 8 in the Loeb Experimental Theater, represents minimalism at its finest. With neither plot nor stage directions, the play is meant to be anonymous; none of the four characters is called by name. Rather, each is referred to with only one letter—”A,” “B,” “C,” and “M”—and even these monikers are never spoken aloud. Kane’s dialogue runs freely from character to character, and she never specifies the audience for each line. On the page, “Crave” demands imagination to create an elucidating context; for an audience, it demands more than simple attention to comprehend; in the theater, it demands significant artistry to bring the play to life. In tackling this challenge, the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club delivers a successful, though at times shaky, rendition driven by skillful direction, design, and acting—aspects that come together to clarify the meaning of “Crave” by echoing its themes with more tangible theatrical devices.
“Crave” is an intentionally ambiguous play. Though the characters’ namelessness contributes to a powerful message about the isolation and futility of life, taken literally it also makes for characters so abstract that they are intangible. Both the actors and director Nasir W. Husain ’12 strike a balance of giving the play space for interpretation while still bringing the characters to life. Stewart N. Kramer ’12 (B), Emily B. Hyman ’13 (M), and Pettee maintain a level of obscurity sufficient to allow the play to carry its original meaning while imbuing their characters with a personality and emotion consistent with the text. Kramer is aloof and snarky, Hyman—fantastic as usual—is overtly sexual. Pettee is fearful and on the border of a nervous breakdown.
These additions are most powerful when they subtly come together to illuminate one of Kane’s otherwise difficult-to-detect meanings. Toward the middle of the play, A (Philip M.  Gillen ’13) makes love to C with a stream of seductive words. “Don’t say no to me,” he says. “You can’t say no to me because it’s such a relief to have love again and to lie in bed and be held and touched and kissed and adored.” Pettee stands out in this moment as she deftly shifts from panicked gasps to ones of sexual pleasure in the middle of his speech and muddles the line between pleasure and fear. Though such a shift is not present in the text itself, it clarifies a similar but even more subtle confusion of pleasure and pain within Kane’s script as A pursues an unwilling C. Kramer and Hyman carry the play with this and other subtle actions that help explicate otherwise difficult messages.
“Crave’s” lighting design (by Bethina Liu ’13 and Gabrielle M. Walti ’14) is similarly successful, as it inventively creates shifts in mood that otherwise would pass unnoticed or even not exist. A third of the way through the play, Liu and Walti cut all lights except for a cleverly placed few that illuminate a white screen from behind. Husain has Gillen write on the wall as he speaks, “The question is, ‘Where do you live, and where do you want to live?’” The play takes a breather from its hurried atmosphere, a break that lends an eerie importance to Gillen’s words.
While Husain generally meets the challenge of allowing “Crave” the space its minimalist nature demands while clarifying its messages through concrete details, occasionally he falters. Sound design (by Husain and Christine E. Gummerson ’12) fluctuates between unhelpfully literal and downright distracting. At times, it is entirely superfluous, such as when Gillen scribbles with a marker on paper and Gummerson and Husain play a track of marker noise that competes with the characters’ voices. In such a small space, the excess noise is unnecessary, as proved when Pettee later writes with a marker, the sound of which carries on its own without distracting from her lines.
One of Husain’s most successful creative liberties lies in organizing the play’s dialogue. In the script, each character speaks in turn, though it is unclear to whom and whether or not there are multiple conversations occurring at once. With his placement of the actors on stage, Husain at times connects certain characters, allows them to speak alone, or encourages their speech to intertwine without bringing their conversations together. His blocking makes Kane’s free flow of words more understandable for the audience, an essential development in a dense play.
“Depression is inadequate. A full-scale emotional collapse is the minimum required to justify letting everyone down,” says C toward the middle of the play. Conversely, a superficial treatment of “Crave” is inadequate; the play demands a rendition in which all aspects of theater come together. Though the production occasionally falters, Husain is able to do just this. He creates a forceful and illuminating interpretation of a complex and abstruse play.

Behind the glass doors of the Carpenter Center’s Sert Gallery lies a boxy room outfitted with the hardwood floors and high white walls traditionally associated with art galleries. However, the space in which “Mark Lewis: Three Cinematic Works”—on view until October 16—is displayed is far from traditional.
In a quaint corridor only just noticeable behind the security desk, three mid-sized plasma screen televisions and three plush leather couches line opposite walls while Lewis’ works—“Downtown: Tilt, Zoom and Pan,” “Rush Hour, Morning and Evening, Cheapside,” and “Queensway: Pan and Zoom”—play on a continuous loop, one on each of the three screens. Lewis’ videos mark the first official exhibit of the Sert Gallery’s new visual media space that makes art accessible by catering to a modern audience’s limited attention span.
To Dominique Bluher, the exhibit’s curator and lecturer on Visual and Environmental Studies, much thought goes into the types of images that are shown in galleries in order to avoid reducing the space to a mainstream movie theater. “I think [Lewis’] work is ... very interesting because he has given a lot of thought about how long these movies are, and he has created works that are valuable in cinema but work exactly in a space where people are coming, standing, discussing, [and] wondering,” she says. While Lewis’ works fit ideally into this new viewing space, the true impetus for the exhibit was actually “Freshman Seminar 38K: ‘Cinema in Theory and Practice’” that Bluher began teaching this fall. “When I was thinking about teaching this class ... I wanted to focus on short films,” she says. “One of [the theories that Lewis] puts in quite a provocative way is that long films can’t be shown in this kind of [art gallery] context because the people wouldn’t spend the time to sit through a movie that is longer than five minutes.” The newly created film media space reflects Lewis’ films in an uncanny way: both are short, visually engaging, and nontraditional.
For David N. Rodowick, the chair of the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies, Interim Director of the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, and William R. Kenan, Jr. Professor of Visual and Environmental Studies, securing the space and then transforming it into the media exhibit was a straightforward process. “I had been looking for a long time for other ways to use the building to expose art [beyond] just ... our traditional spaces in the main lobby and in the Sert gallery,” he says. “I was walking here to meet some people in the offices back there, and I went ‘What can I do with this space?’ ... We came in with $3,000 of unspent money and we put in [the] monitors. It’s as easy as that.”
Like Bluher, Rodowick also commented on how the newly created space was perfect for Lewis’ work. “He’s a rather astounding artist, I think. What’s interesting about his work is that he’s very attentive to scale,” he says. “[Lewis] understood that you could make very compelling works of short length that were very challenging in terms of their questions of composition of movement or stillness, silence, or sound, which makes them, I think, perfect for this kind of show.”
The appeal of Lewis’ work is not limited to art professionals just as its message is not confined to the gallery space. Stephanie H. Liu ’15, a student in Bluher’s freshman seminar, was struck by the power of Lewis’ art in her own life. “His work is really interesting because it makes me stop and think about scenes ... Now, as I’m walking along in my daily life I start seeing ordinary scenes and I say ‘What potential is here? Look for the beauty.’” In displaying Lewis’ work, the Carpenter Center’s new media viewing area helps spread this message of encouraging people go beyond looking for art in art galleries to finding it in their everyday lives.

With two editors-cum-writers, a comic with his fist in his mouth, refrigerator art, and a yeti, “An Evening with McSweeney’s Editors” was far from the expected bookstore event. However, the event this past Wednesday still included a reading and signing of “The Funny Man” by author John D. Warner and a presentation by Chris R. Monks, a current McSweeney’s editor. According to Alex W. Merriweather, staff member and organizer of the event, the bookstore was very excited to have both Warner and Monks, and the event drew a large crowd comprised of writers and students.
“Timothy McSweeney’s Internet Tendency,” the humor website known for its satirical features, started as an HTML collection of reject authors but has developed into a multifaceted publication house that draws thousands of submissions per year. As the former editor of this viral phenomenon, Warner has the wit to match that of the website. His cut and dry humor was clear as he read one of his short pieces, an epic saga entitled “My Bestseller” that described how he should have written about the trials of a half-yeti half-teen getting ready for the high school prom. “One of the cool ironies about writing is that the ideas, the conception, the vision never gets on the page in quite the way it exists in the writer’s mind,” Warner said, and “My Bestseller” is no exception.
Warner also spent time reading from a chapter of his new book, “The Funny Man,” which he described as a reflection of the American condition: “No matter what you have, it’s never enough.” The central character in his novel is a comic who has achieved fame by putting his fist in his mouth every time he does a sketch. However, he later suffers what Warner called a Charlie Sheen meltdown due to his dissatisfaction at the state of his life. This observation of the absurdity of the celebrity lifestyle is, according to Warner, humor with a purpose. “This is satire in service of more serious commentary,” he said. Though different in content, “The Funny Man” does not stray from Warner’s comic writing style.
Monks was the next to speak, reading from his “Submission Guidelines for Our Refrigerator Door,” the last piece of his to appear on McSweeney’s. According to Monks, he has a self-deprecating sense of humor; he used to have a column that satirized his experiences as a stay-at-home dad. Now, as the editor of “Internet Tendency,” he reads every one of the 200 to 300 weekly submissions.
Monks’ job maintaining the ingenuity and tongue-in-cheek humor for which McSweeney’s is known means envisioning a movement toward a more graphics-accessible design for the website. For the main part, however, he believes “Internet Tendency” will and should maintain its traditional text-based layout. During their question-and-answer session, both Monks and Warner spoke of the plethora of meta-pieces dealing with the Internet and social networking, as well as the overabundance of list submissions with the title “List of Rejected McSweeney’s Pieces,” most of which they ironically tend to reject.
There was no doubt that a large percentage of the audience consisted of avid readers of or potential contributors to McSweeney’s. “I usually read the lists, and may have submitted something a while ago,” said Merriweather. This familiarity  with “The Funny Man,” or McSweeney’s, or both made most people very enthusiastic in getting to know Warner and Monks during the brief book signing at the end of the night.
While they were not the youngish hipsters that one would probably envision McSweeney’s editors to be, Warner and Monk brought a lot to the table. They kept it light with their visions for the future of McSweeney’s and paid attention first and foremost to the humor. After all, as Monk said, “We’re just being funny.”

“Since the life of the mind finds expression in art and literature, the literary imagination is where we go to access, teach, explain, divulge, and question the official mythologies of history,” said Paolo Asso, W.E.B. Du Bois Fellow and Scholar-in-Residence at Harvard and assistant professor of classical studies at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, as part of his talk on “Ideas of Africa in the Roman Epic” last Wednesday. Speaking from research he had done for his as yet unfinished monograph called “Africa in the Roman Literary Imagination,” Asso went on to examine the ancient Roman identity as seen through its mythology. “In exposing mythologies and genealogies, I am chiefly interested in the mindset that emerges from the ancient sources,” he said. He proceeded to examine African portrayal in two Latin epics: Virgil’s “Aeneid” and the longest poem in ancient Latin literature, Silius Italicus’s “Punica.”
Speaking as part of the W.E.B. Du Bois Fall Colloquium Series, Paolo Asso explained how the Roman characters perceive Africans as cunning, barbarous, and savage in both texts. “I’ve read the Aeneid before, but I didn’t notice how native Africans were portrayed as people to be feared,” said Elliot A. Wilson ’15. “I’m not going to look at the poem the same way again.” However, as Asso points out, Africans were described in both the “Aeneid” and “Punica” with as much awe as fear. Indeed, Asso explains that racism did not exist in the modern sense of the word; Romans were both fascinated and frightened of African war and African physique, but they were never prejudiced against Africans.
To defend his claim, Asso used excerpts from each epic, replications of ancient European and African maps, and even a photograph of an ancient silver bowl depicting a woman with an elephant trunk on her forehead. By the end of his talk, he was able to link all of these representations of art to his central argument: Romans saw themselves as a part of a nation defined by the territories it conquered, not by the race of its people. This unique perception of identity of both the conquerors and the conquered became Asso’s focus.
According to Asso, Africans were considered inferior to Romans, but in the third century B.C.E., when Rome intended to conquer the world, virtually every other territory was considered an inferior enemy—at least until the territory became Roman. In this sense, the Romans were an open-minded people willing to accept different ethnicities into their Empire. In “The Aeneid,” Virgil describes blacks from Africa as having skin that was burned by the sun, a description that suggests that Romans saw no difference between themselves and those whom they conquered, as long as the conquered people called themselves Romans as well.
Audience member Rayshauna Gray, a Somerville resident, said that she was drawn to the talk because Greek and Roman mythology reminded her of slave narratives from the antebellum United States. “I was able to get a glimpse of the origins of black perception, and to see how these [black] identities developed,” she said. Indeed, many members of the audience asked during the discussion section about the difference between the perception of the African in Ancient Rome and of the black American in the modern day.
While the Romans were busy chiseling statues that venerated the human body, they did not discriminate the ideal body by race. The silver bowl that Asso showed during his talk was discovered as part of the Boscoreale Treasure—a trove of buried silver—after the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. It depicts an African woman whose body is idealized, not depicted a joke or a terror. Art was something to be immortalized, so the Romans were careful to make the proportions of the bust exact and the maps of their empire all-inclusive.
The next step for Asso in understanding the Romans’ perception of self was to examine their artifacts in more depth. “I’m interested in the ways in which ancient Greek and Roman literary sources treat Africa, her gods, peoples, animals, plants, and inanimate entities.” Maps with distorted geography and alternate names could reveal a lot about what the Romans perceived the lands they conquered.
The toughest part of understanding the ancients, according to Asso, is the language barrier. To view Latin text or art merely as a passing scholar is difficult without great familiarity with the language. “I feel sometime I need to let students ‘borrow my eyes’ to read the Greek and Latin words behind the English ones,” said Asso, “because the original music of the ancient tongue is just as crucial as the meaning that the words have in English.” In examining the “Aeneid” and the “Punica” with a fresh perspective, Asso not only provides a unique look at ancient texts as a window into the Roman identity but also makes this identity relevant to our own perceptions today.

Nearly every time I go to a museum, I’m asked to move. I’m blocking someone’s camera or camcorder. Outside, I run into a related problem, walking regularly into someone’s picture or straight into someone. It’s painfully funny how the visitor’s approach to the museum and the tourist’s plan for a city mirror one another.
Maybe it always was this way and only now is it so evident, but the purposes of traveling and of going to a museum seem to have both become simply to fulfill expectations and to document them as such. The tourism industry and the museum education office encourage the former; for the latter, the tourist and museum-goer turns to the camera. In turn, the two create and perpetuate a terrible cycle that makes the complexity and ambiguity of cities and artwork into something static and stale.
There is no avoiding or forgetting preconceptions and expectations. For the tourist the city is as meticulously curated as any museum. It adheres to an idea of the city stored in the collective consciousness of travel television, popular movies, classic novels, long-held stereotypes, and the photographs that make their way onto postcards, Facebook, photo albums, and slideshows. Buses lumber down identical routes, stopping at every tourist destination for photographs and souvenirs, just as docents shepherd tour groups to the major works (and gift shops) housed in their institutions. Judging by the loudspeakers, the intricate number-assigning and person-counting, the constant reviewing of itinerary and maps, and the persistent waving of little flags, the biggest fear of both parties seems to be that someone will get lost. To wander is somehow unacceptable, because to wander is for us and our cameras to risk missing what we have learned to anticipate.
It’s unclear who is taking the cues from whom. Is the museum accommodating itself to the onslaught of tourism? Or is the tourism industry understanding and fashioning the city according to the museum? What gets a larger frenzy of cameras: the Eiffel Tower or the Mona Lisa? The camera records indiscriminately, taking in what is in its scope in any particular moment—it acts the same whether capturing a family vacation portrait or the inner contents of your bag. Cameras take no notice of language barriers or locals who do not want their photograph taken. They cannot recognize a Matisse and its significance—at best they reproduce it in postcard quality. Food, flowers, and spices are perishable, but photographs on a laptop or in an album are readily stored, easily consumable and universally comprehensible.
Photography, when practiced in this manner, doesn’t teach one to look, reflect, or question, but merely to find, categorize, and confirm. How often have we heard the exclamation: It is just like in the pictures! The search then is to make each picture resemble as closely as possible the emblematic, the recognizable, and the already memorialized image. Context—what can place a photograph in time rather than in the artificial blur of guidebooks and exhibition catalogues—is disastrous.
This pursuit promises control precisely where we typically have none. Being in a foreign city is chaotic—it seems to expand relentlessly and you have to decide where to start, go, and end; where to eat, where to sleep, and more besides. The museum, for the casual visitor,  is similar—centuries of works and a mess of a historical trajectory are crammed into an overwhelmingly large space. The camera makes both conquerable in the most demeaning of ways. The city is multi-faceted and mercurial, evading categorization, so much more than the sum of its monuments. Artworks in museums remain for the most part the same, but they are also the product of too many variables to name— the market, the agency of the artist, reception, medium, artistic self-construction, social capital, political control, artistic institutions, etc. With the steady snapping and flashing of the camera, the yelps of “Cheese!,” and the waddling of parents and toddlers, the city and its artwork are reduced to postcards.
There’s Paris, the Mona Lisa, Berlin, the Eiffel tower, Nefertiti... where were we again?

If you asked an average person to imagine a Foster the People live show, they would likely imagine a several-hour-long affair comprised solely of various renditions of the hit single “Pumped Up Kicks.” But on Thursday, September 29, the emerging indie-pop band showed that they’re more than just one-hit wonders. The concert was an electrifying performance of their latest album, “Torches,” and was equal parts spectacle and dance party.
While the indie-pop haze of “Pumped Up Kicks” catapulted Foster the People onto the music scene, the rest of their album is even poppier. The heavy bass and upbeat sound of most of their songs make them particularly good dance pieces that translate very well to a live performance. The set drove the audience into a wild frenzy of hopping, waving, flailing, and grinding, and they were spurred all the more by lead singer Mark Foster’s unbridled performance. The succession of fast and fun songs only broke once for a performance of the unreleased ballad, “Ruby,” which provided a welcome release from the otherwise unrelenting pace. Immediately following that brief respite, the concert’s energy mounted fiercely, culminating in an epic performance of “Pumped up Kicks,” the running time of which almost doubled. Mark Foster topped his already vivacious live performance with a delirious energy that he poured into his heightened vocals and fierce back-up drumming.
Their musical performance preserved the quality of their recorded work. Despite an absence of the sort of effects that helps give “Pumped Up Kicks” its unique sound, the group played with a well-worn precision. Mark Foster in particular demonstrated a wide range of musical talent throughout the performance, and he was almost constantly switching among vocals, keyboard, guitar, percussion, and synthesizer. Indeed, the only moments when he wasn’t moving were those when he was constrained by his stationary keyboard. This constant movement is what characterized the group’s strong suit. Within a few songs, the band had danced themselves into a heavy sweat that only grew heavier over the course of the evening.
The audience gave an equally intense, loud, and physical reaction. One gentleman became so enthused during “I Would Do Anything for You” that he leaped on the back of his friend and removed his shirt while shouting, “We love you Foster!” The lead singer literally felt the audience’s enthusiasm when an eager fan threw her bra directly into his face during the second song, “Miss You.” The bra, which remained on the mic stand for much of the performance, served as a constant reminder of the equal passions of band and audience.
This sort of audience engagement was not present during the opening acts. Though it was of course expected for most of the fan base to be supporting Foster the People, roughly two-thirds of the concert was played by the openers. Because Foster the People have only released one album, the openers bore the onus of lengthening the concert to a full three hours. All three of the bands gave fantastic performances, but while the limited material from Foster the People was expected, the audience seemed unhappy about waiting even through good openers for only an hour of the headliner, especially when Foster the People only played one more song than opening act Cults.
Nonetheless, when Foster the People did come out, the audience went crazy, and the live performance surpassed expectations to reveal the band’s full talent. Indeed, Foster the People played an 11-song set that included all but one of their album’s songs, and the brevity of their set, while necessitating the lengthy opening acts, allowed Foster the People to reach a level of intensity that would have been more difficult to sustain over the course of a longer show. Though the evening was short enough to ensure that “Pumped Up Kicks” remained the focus of the evening, the band’s unfaltering delivery of the rest of their album’s equally appealing if different content suggests that more hits may lie in their future.

“There was so much electricity in this city that you felt on the verge of something all the time.” These words were posted on the Tumblr of DRC Music, a collective of Western producers, about the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kinshasa.
Led by master producer and artist Damon Albarn of Blur and Gorillaz fame, DRC Music took five days to do what takes most musicians months, and they did it with an impressive array of local Congolese artists. The product is “Kinshasa One Two,” an album that’s much less governed by the intentions of the producers and much more by the people and sounds of the city. While the trademarks of each producer are certainly present—“Hallo” relies on a Gorillaz-esque brassy synth and swaggering hip-hop beat—the album’s production feels like a response rather than a guiding force, led by the sounds of the Kinshasan musicians—and their city—rather than the producers’ desires.
This marriage of styles sometimes means that the tracks sound a little alien. The mixture of repetitive chanting, soaring, arrhythmic vocals, and an eerily understated drumbeat on “Lingala” creates an unsettling atmosphere that feels more creepy than compelling. On this track, the delay effects on the vocals and the jittery drum machine beat serve only to destabilize what seems to be an otherwise traditional song.
The other tracks, though, display just the right balance of organic sounds and sleek production. However, other than a pervasive excellence of execution, there are few similarities between the tracks. The most effective songs on “Kinshasa One Two” are structured around the voices of native Kinshasans. “African Space Anthem (A.S.A)” is an upbeat rap accompanied by a rapid triplet beat, whereas the a cappella fourth track, “Love,” strips this aesthetic down to its bare essentials. These songs display the incredible creative depth of Kinshasan singers, and deliver a multifaceted portrait of the city.
Songs like “Lourds,” a slow jam that sounds appealingly like it was recorded live in a dingy club, expand the record’s musical palette to incorporate denser instrumentation. “Respect of the Rules” is wholly instrumental except for a few short vocal samples, and it centers on a driving beat punctuated by handclaps and colored with both sharp synths and airy flutes. The stripped-down “We Come From the Forest” is a chaotic frenzy of intricate drumming, plinking marimbas, and call-and-response chanting. The production on the more layered instrumental tracks is least incongruous, and these songs contribute to the record’s authentic feel.
Though the feeling of authenticity evoked in the less-produced tracks is potent, some of the album’s most incongruously Western and African tracks still manage to convey a distinct national character. “Ah Congo” features a hypnotic mélange of big, echoing samples of African choirs and unsettlingly low, muttering speech, produced with heavy reverb. “If You Wish to Stay Awake” lives up to its title, with its nightclub-ready pounding bass and whooshing cymbals. “Customs” evolves surprisingly as it rolls along, anchored by a lurching, ominous bass riff that, despite its almost funk sound, works remarkably well with the track’s atmospheric bells.
Perhaps the album’s only big misstep comes in the first half of the two-part closer, “Departure,” a symphonic-minded mess of interesting but incoherent ideas that feels out of place, especially at the end of the already borderline incoherent album. Ultimately, “Kinshasa One Two” is most powerful at its simplest. This is perhaps epitomized by the poignant “Virginia,” which is composed solely of a monotonous, percussive synthesizer and the layered voices of Kinshasans going about their daily lives—a mother singing her child to sleep, a man and woman conversing in hushed tones. It adds an emotional depth to the album and serves as a very salient reminder that the thematic, tonal, and emotional core of this seemingly eclectic album is its role as an aural portrait of Kinshasa: chaotic, energetic, occasionally messy, but undeniably electrifying.

Perhaps the only description that could do Nika Danilova’s remarkably unique voice justice is the one provided by her strange moniker, Zola Jesus. Just as the figures of Émile Zola and Jesus Christ somehow seemed to fit together for her, so too do the blend of heavy studio production and almost operatic vocals on her latest album “Conatus, ” in which Danilova brings two disparate elements together into a lush, coherent whole.
Zola Jesus’s previous two albums were, in a certain sense, more straightforward. Danilova, operatically trained since childhood, let her throaty, raw-yet-velvety voice dominate the arrangements by keeping atmospherics and instrumentals minimal. Her third venture into an almost gothic style of somber rock marks the evolution of her style away from this sparse aesthetic. The shift is immediately apparent on opening track “Swords,” a wordless, thumping whirlpool, on which an echoing blend of percussion and synth builds and fades until Danilova’s hollow, background vocals are all that remain.
Danilova experiments heavily with production in “Conatus,” though her unmistakable, silky and commanding voice remains the most arresting feature of the album. Persistent bass and moody live strings pervade the majority of the songs, while electronic sounds allow Danilova to construct tracks that can intensify just as easily as they can dissolve. The manipulation of haunting background vocals and a relentless synth rhythm mark “Ixode,” an invasive track that wavers between insistent and sly. This duality of heavy production and a bare style, present throughout the album, fosters an alluring tension: “Ixode,” along with “Seekir” and “Avalanche,” could be either entirely danceable or soothingly elemental.
For the most part, though, Danilova expresses her emotions entirely through her impressive vocal range, which takes center stage while the contrast between spare and chaotic arrangements maintain the listener’s interest. “Hikikomori,” aptly named after a Japanese term for self-containment or pulling away, features an assortment of strings that grow increasingly frenzied. Danilova herself can express desperation through somewhat garbled lyrics— “Keeps me awake now / Keeps me arrested”—and enunciation that sounds reluctant, as if she were dragging each sound from her throat.
“Lick the Palm of the Burning Handshake,” which features arguably the most comprehensible lyrics of the album, retains that distraught quality even as Danilova allows her voice to mellow and warm on a sweeping melody. The lyrics themselves are not particularly revolutionary or exceptional, but Danilova’s voice becomes unexpectedly sweet and equally heart-wrenching, and it crafts a sense of beautiful melancholia that is increasingly dominant on the album. This gentleness is especially present on “Skin,” where a simple, unadorned piano accompaniment gently supports the ambiguous lyrics: “Safety net don’t hold me now / In this hole I’ve fallen down.”
Though the substantial production lends many of the songs more nuance, it occasionally sits uneasily, and serves more to occlude her brilliant vocals than to enhance them. On “In Your Nature,” the incessant percussion threatens to overwhelm all other aspects of an otherwise promising song. Closing track, “Collapse,” evokes its title by becoming overwhelmed with persistent synth effects, and it seems to have the same effect on the ear as a cheese grater would. Meanwhile, “Seekir” and “Shiver” encounter a different problem: a lack of the originality present in the other tracks. These songs simply continue the musical themes of the preceding numbers with little alteration, and fail to contribute anything significant to the album as a whole.
Danilova has built “Conatus” out of mostly effective production techniques, but her foundation remains in her consistently expressive voice. “It hurts to let you in,” she claims in “Collapse,” but after 40 minutes of showcasing her range, depth and versatility, it feels as if she has done just that.

Ryan Adams would be the first person to tell you that he is one of the finest singer-songwriters of the early 21st century. Since his commercial breakthrough in the wake of 9/11 with his love letter to the Big Apple, “New York, New York,” Adams has embarked on a largely anachronistic music career, exploring the depths of ’60s- and ’70s-inspired folk, country, and rock. Not many contemporary artists can boast 13 studio albums in 11 years, yet Adams has managed to compile one of the most erratic and prolific discographies in modern music. He exhibits the emotional depth and sensitivity of a country crooner and the drug-addled swagger of a punk rocker. The problem with his latest effort “Ashes & Fire” is that in his recent two-year hiatus from recording, he seems to have forgotten all of the charisma and arrogance that made him so appealing in the first place.
As its title implies, “Ashes & Fire” is a largely somber affair, arguably the most down-tempo and moody record of Adams’s career. From the very first track, “Dirty Rain,” Adams emphasizes the titular apocalyptic imagery: “Last time I was here, it was raining.” The album’s lyrics are filled with images like “church bells ringing through the sirens” and “coats full of bullet holes.” Adams aims to replicate contemporary feelings of both loss and solidarity in his songs. Part of Adams’ appeal has always been his dense and often contradictory lyrics, and this style is most evident in his feelings towards love. In the album’s first single, “Lucky Now,” he claims that “night will break your heart / But only if you’re lucky now.” It’s difficult to know exactly what he means by this statement, but the confusion suggested by his lyrics reflects the perplexities of his subject matter, and he uses this device to great effect throughout the album. Lyrically, “Ashes & Fire” is right on par with his previous work, if a little bit predictable.
“Ashes & Fire” falters in its relative lack of musical inspiration. On many albums, the B-side of the record can sag with middling, midtempo filler that lacks the punch of the album’s front end. Unfortunately, such material dominates the majority of “Ashes,” with most cuts relying primarily on acoustic guitar, an occasional sprinkling of organ, and hollow drumming. The dragging “Save Me” sounds like Ryan Adams 101, with a slow alt-country melody, imagery of midnight bars, and Adams’s incessant refrain, “Somebody save me.” It’s nothing that his fans haven’t heard before, and compared to previous torch songs like “Come Pick Me Up” and “Two,” it lacks the emotional punch and intricate arrangements that characterized his earlier work. “Do I Wait” and “Invisible Riverside” simmer with frustration without reaching any kind of musical climax, and are ultimately too melodically repetitious to be memorable. Not even background vocals from Norah Jones and wife Mandy Moore can save most of the album’s tracks from sheer tedium.
There are certainly some appealing songs here—most notably “Chains of Love.” Over spiraling guitar lines and bright strings, Adams delivers the title phrase with his signature raspy belt. It’s the most upbeat track on the record, but alas, over the album’s entire 43-minute playing time, “Chains of Love” clocks in at just over two minutes. In that small span, Adams revives his rare gifts for hooks and melody only to let them dissipate on the next track. Similarly, penultimate track “Lucky Now” succeeds despite relying on many of the same musical ideas as the rest of the album. It manages to craft an elegant acoustic melody that opens up in a fully electric riff as the song’s emotional and lyrical intensity builds with stunning control. The masterfully simple agreement in tone between words and music in “Lucky Now” makes the rest of the album’s tracks pale in comparison. The majority of the cuts operate in a kind of monotone, and employ similar instrumentation and themes that ultimately bleed together. It makes the highlights ultimately much more refreshing, but it’s a shame there couldn’t have been a few more standout songs on the album.
Even with Adams’s penchant for prolific release schedules, it’s understandable that a two-year recuperative hiatus to battle Ménière’s disease might have dulled his musical sensibility. Yet, the majority of “Ashes & Fire” seems to lack any kind of genuine emotional or musical investment. The record plods along at a sluggish pace and only emerges from its haze at occasional moments of energetic levity. It makes for harmless and inoffensive background music, but it falters as an attempt at a compelling and engaging musical product.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Violence represented in literature can be compelling and evocative, but it is always morally problematic. The reader cannot be an innocent spectator: by imagining the act, he or she becomes an accomplice. Daniel Woodrell, a native of the Missouri Ozarks, uses this complicity to profound effect in “The Outlaw Album,” his new collection of short stories. His project is simple: to communicate a detailed, visceral experience of the contemporary Ozarks—their people, their past, their problems, and their often frightening propensity for acts of extreme violence. He does not seek to condemn or to offer grotesque stereotypes of southern cavemen. Rather, he immerses us in a complex and ambiguous rural world, where we can come to sympathize with—and perhaps even understand—his vicious characters. When successful, the stories are unsettling and compassionate in equally vast proportions. When they fail, Woodrell’s constant harping on the place of violence in Ozark culture seems contrived and lurid. But for better or for worse, the stories are consistently involving. Woodrell’s short fiction cuts deep, and neither heart nor stomach can remain unscathed.
The collection begins with a line that seems to describe the book as well as its first protagonist: “Once Boshell finally killed his neighbor he couldn’t seem to quit killing him.” Like Boshell, Woodrell just can’t shake his preoccupation with violence.This story, titled “The Echo of Neighborly Bones,” presents a situation that seems ethically unambiguous. Boshell has killed his neighbor for killing Boshell’s dog, and now he keeps returning to the neighbor’s corpse to punish it for his own daily woes. However, the narration of the story continually confounds an immediate moral response by introducing, through sympathy, a creeping moral doubt. Boshell comforts his bawling wife over the lost dog, and he has a dark and delightful sense of humor. His act is still monstrous, but he evokes more sympathy than he initially seems to deserve. He is not a monster, but rather the executor of a very particular moral code, one that prizes destructive revenge as the instrument of justice.
The situations become even more convoluted and unclear in the subsequent stories. Woodrell introduces past trauma, unreliable consciousness, the ubiquitous bottle of bourbon, and the sinister whisper of methamphetamine, any of which may be roiling behind a character’s eyes at any time. “Black Step,” perhaps the strongest in the collection, follows a war veteran back from “the desert” as he reflects on his euthanization of a cow, pitifully caught in a tree that hangs out from a cliff. He interacts normally with his friends and his lover, and he cares for his mother’s cows, but as soon as he begins to paint for recreation, old wounds open anew. “They told me maybe I should paint,” he explains, “take up painting landscapes or portraits, something soothing, but whenever I try the picture explodes on me, the light of day shatters, the humans don’t look too human, and strange patterns span the sky.” Post-traumatic stress lurks in many of Woodrell’s male characters, whether the conflict  in question is Iraq, Vietnam, or even, in the historical “Woe to Live On,” the American Civil War.
Grounding this psychological excess is a whirl of concrete details and referents. This is where Woodrell’s craftsmanship becomes most distinct, and where his intimate familiarity with the Ozarks is most obvious. In “Twin Forks,” Woodrell describes a character’s return to his campground on a May morning: “There would be coffee boiling over freshened campfires, bacon sizzling, trout split and dropped into the grease, and as he passed the earliest to rise he’d wave and they’d wave back. He’d open the store early, skin numbed by the river and feeling tightened ten years younger, the smell of the outdoors drying into his hair.” One rarely gets a discrete sense of space in these stories, but there is little need when place is so exhaustively drawn.
Woodrell is not always capable of maintaining a balance between his plausible world of concrete details and the horrifying peaks of his emotional excess. When his melodrama bleeds into his sharp descriptions of the Ozarks, he dilutes his stories’ realism for no good reason. Elsewhere in “Twin Forks,” families at the campground fight over picnic tables that are riddled with bullet holes because they want “the rights to that exotic detail.” In this scene, Woodrell draws these families with very simple and thick lines, repeatedly insisting that violence holds a special fascination for this culture. What results is a dubious, even ridiculous situation that reads more like satire than literary realism: it is one of few exceptions to Woodrell’s captivating specificity.
The last act in “The Outlaw Album” is, unsurprisingly, two criminal brothers’ jubilant escape into the woods. One has burned down a neighbor’s house to allow his father to die with a view of the river, and the other is along for the ride. Even when Woodrell highlights the cruelty and suffering of his native region, he understands that there is hope, even if it is just the hope of the outlaw before the cops catch up.

The modern purgatory of Russell Banks’ new novel is chilling because it is true. Like Banks’ protagonist, the Kid, there are thousands of sex offenders who have been released from jail but are no longer allowed to live in regular society. They wander from place to place, sometimes in camps but more often alone, trying to find a decent living spot more than 2500 feet away from a school, a nursery, a playground, and yet within the county in which they were arrested.  Often, men like this bond in shantytowns, held together by nothing more than their common fate. Although these camps may sound contrived, they actually exist. And it is in this disturbing reality that Banks introduces lives and characters that many might like to ignore.
“Lost Memory of Skin” opens on one of these sex-offender campgrounds. Settling at the Causeway, the Kid has at last found, if not a home, somewhere to keep his stuff for a while. The Kid seems innocently naïve but is a registered sex offender. He and his giant pet iguana Iggy live in a tent in the shantytown along with other offenders who sport nicknames like Rabbi and Plato the Greek. The squatters’ village barely gets by on the feeble incomes of its occupants, and Banks tries to evoke sympathy for them, only to undercut it by inserting reminders that these are rapists in legal purgatory who are banned from normal society.
Purgatory—or the “in between”—is a vital concept in “Lost Memory of Skin.” Banks uses a sex offender, someone who is legally in between, to introduce us to the real topic of the novel—how we, as a society, have become trapped in the gap between reality and imagination. “Lost Memory of Skin” is a novel about the evils of technology, in particular the Internet. One character does nothing but “turns and looks the Professor over once, top to bottom, then goes back to the blank TV screen”. The same Professor takes delight in the fact that “it shouldn’t be difficult to answer the question of the Kid’s real name. No need to sit around waiting for the Kid to volunteer it. All he has to do is Google his way” into finding it. Each of the book’s motley characters is affected in a different way by technology, but they all languish under its invisible grasp. More disturbing is what the Internet does to those who are already morally in between. Although Banks takes his time in revealing what actually got the Kid into this mess, he allows the Kid to reflect on the Internet’s involvement. The Kid was first sucked in, according to his telling, by pornography and images on TV.
“Lost Memory of Skin” is also a perverse coming-of-age story. The Kid grows up, in every way, over the course of the novel. He begins to understand his existence as not a sexual one, but as “if he’s outside of all sexual potential ... without an erotic marker of any kind, [with] no sexual past or future.” For a man like this, the allure of young bodies is more a test than an attraction. By bringing this to light, Banks forces difficult questions about how the Kid as sex offender relates to the Kid as person.
Unfortunately, Banks weakens his riveting and disturbing novel by including the Professor. All of the characters go solely by their nicknames, but the Professor lives up to his title so well that it is impossible to imagine any other moniker for him. Banks seems to take a cheap shot at the intelligentsia by parodying their studies of the human soul. As a sociologist, the Professor looks upon the people he studies “scientifically ... like lab specimens.” As a genius, the Professor always believes that he “was smarter than the government agents he reported to and smarter than the people he reported on and needed to prove it”. As a Yale graduate, the Professor is an egotistical snob. While Banks clearly has a vendetta against this type of personality, his caricature of the Professor is so extreme that it detracts from the story’s realism.
“Lost Memory of Skin” offers a penetrating critique of the assumptions that our society makes about the people it casts out. By drawing the sex offender out of his purgatory to prove his moral and intellectual mettle, Banks exercises his impeccable mastery of craft while warning against the dangers of technology. However, by taking purposely “upstanding” men and glaring unsparingly at their worst qualities, Banks too often falls into the mode of the wild-eyed preacher. Rather than allowing readers to decide for themselves, he decides for us “how seriously to take all your secrets and lies.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Barley Patch,” a new novel by Gerald Murnane, takes the landscape of the mind, with its fragmentary images and memories tightly woven, as its setting. “Must I write?” the novel asks at it opens, followed by “Why had I written?” These jarring questions establish Murnane’s objective: to interrogate his own intellect and creativity through a bifurcated narrative of question and answer. Murnane oscillates between delicate imagery, fictional characters, and shards of memory. But these vertices of narrative, unlike those in other works of fiction, are not bound together to construct an arc upon which the reader can walk. Instead, he is hurled into the intricate depths of the author’s own creative genius, which ultimately forces the reader to confront his own literary crisis: Why must I read?
In the opening page Murnane quotes from a letter written by Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke to a struggling poet: “This above all—ask yourself in the stillest hour of your night: must I write?” Murnane, some 15 years previously, had asked himself that very question one night. He had had no answer, and thus he stopped writing. In a novel, however, which intentionally disguises fiction as fact and fact as fiction, the validity of this crisis comes into question. Murnane anticipates this and attempts to construct an answer to whether he must write, all while defending the legitimacy of his artistic crisis. The result is a striking paradox of categorized narrative and simplistic poeticism that loosely charts Murnane’s life and fiction writing.
“Barley Patch” is a novel of ghosts: ghost-characters, ghost-landscapes, ghost-images. Murnane’s descriptions intentionally distort his attempts at character construction and scene creation. A figure may be described in intricate detail in one specific pose, but left unnamed, or only described from one perspective. Even more confusingly, it is often unclear which character is being described or doing a particular action. Thus characters and landscapes are mere shadows in the text, seen only dimly and never in their entirety. Much like shadows, they are mere signifiers of something greater that looms just outside our view.
This ghostly landscape transfigures the text into a device designed to mirror Murnane’s own inner landscape. In describing his first experiences of reading fiction as a child, he writes, “I felt as though I myself moved among the characters.” Murnane explains how, whilst reading, he never aligned his perspective in the fictional panorama with a primary character or the narrator. Rather, he would position himself into the text itself, moving and walking freely amongst the characters. “I could watch openly while my favorite female character rode on horseback,” he reminisces, “to the far side of some landscape described in the text and even further.” This experience of reading morphs one’s own self into a ghost or shadow figure—one who is not entirely present but nonetheless moves within the text’s world.
Despite its focus on the author’s interior, conflict does arise in “Barley Patch.” The structure of the novel is formulated as a question-and-answer dialogue, with one part of Murnane’s consciousness interrogating the other. Due to this conceit, the text can lapse into complex categorization of detail, as Murnane narrates his intent for each image even as he describes it. The narrative can be somewhat clumsy and exceedingly complex. Although frustrating, it is clear that this is Murnane’s bid to negate the construction of a believable plane of reality. The awkward syntax and hierarchical categorization of images and people constantly jars the reader out of the absorption that Murnane values so highly in his own enjoyment of fiction.
In striking contrast to these passages are those moments that hone in on simplistic imagery: “a strand of hair lying diagonally across the forehead of a young female person who looked out across an ocean or who lay with closed eyes beneath a lake.” Murnane’s images are bare and extremely visual. His mode of description does not disguise the image, but lays it naked for inspection. Certain images, such as the girl staring out across the ocean or a fern frond immersed in the waves, recur throughout the text, revealing a cyclical nature that would not have been evident from the structure alone. The narrative revolves in an intricate cycle [REP], never moving closer to answering its primary question.
Imagination is central to Murnane’s intellectual crisis. One of the novel’s recurrent images is that of a two-story house from which Murnane might view the surrounding landscape: “I mostly saw myself-the-adult as a reader or a writer in a house of two-storeys overlooking rural landscapes.” The house serves as a metaphor for Murnane’s conception of the imagination. The mind surveys the world from the second-story window, accumulating and absorbing all details of the external world. However, because there are areas in the landscape one cannot see, we must imagine what lies beyond our view based on the landscape we can see.
This, then, is the nature of fiction writing: using details and shards from the external world and piecing them together within the mind to construct something else, “details worthy to be included in the scenery that I needed to have always at the back of my mind and outlines of persons worthy to live among that scenery.” But Murnane is unable to reconcile this appropriation of real images and stories with his ideas about imagination and fiction writing. It becomes apparent that this is why he stopped writing. The novel, itself a complex weave of fact and fiction, tries to divine a way of producing fiction set within an imaginative plane different from reality.
Yet the novel fails to achieve this goal. Instead, its main accomplishment is its transcendence of image. ”Barley Patch” concludes with Murnane seeing a young woman on a bus and cataloguing her image within his mind for use at a later date. The book’s conclusion prefers the authority of image over that of word. Word acts as a shadow, the mere precursor to something far bigger that looms just behind it. The novel movingly and successfully resolves its own paradoxes. For, as the narrative modes are reconciled, so too Murnane reconciles his critique of the imagination with the shadow-like power of image. The answer to the question “Must I write?” is a resounding yes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When threatened, the leopard gecko, like some other lizard species, will detach its tail in order to escape. Under similar conditions, a sea cucumber will expel some of its internal organs, and soldier ants of Malaysian ant colonies can internally combust, exploding poison over their enemies and sacrificing themselves for the safety of the colony. Indeed, the animal kingdom is full of examples of creatures that will go to great lengths for their own security, or that of their kin. We humans like to think of ourselves as above such crude acts. We have laws, governments, and international organizations to decide the appropriate sacrifices to be made in the interest of security.
This past weekend, however, a great line has been crossed—and a great sacrifice made—in America’s seemingly never-ending “War on Terror.” In a Central Intelligence Agency and U.S. Joint Special Operations Command coordinated drone attack, missiles were launched at a car containing Anwar al-Awlaki and Samir Khan, two American citizens hiding out in Yemen, operating with the Yemeni branch of al-Qaeda. Al-Awlaki was a well-known cleric who had originally spoken out for understanding after the attacks of September 11 before radicalizing and preaching for jihad against America. Khan, who lived in America as recently as four years ago, was one of the masterminds behind “Inspire,” an English-language recruiting magazine for al-Qaeda.
To be sure, al-Awlaki and Kahn were sources of terror in the world. The reports released to the public implicate them in terrorist activities, and depict them as threats to American security. However, this should not reduce the alarm elicited by the extrajudicial assassination of not one but two American citizens.
Our generation has seen torture and privacy radically redefined to serve the purposes of a war, allegedly for our own safety. We have been told that our battle with terror requires certain extra, unusual measures. The previous presidential administration authorized the use of “enhanced interrogation techniques” on prisoners held on American military bases without due process, bases that the current administration has failed to shut down despite campaign promises to do so. Sections of the USA PATRIOT Act have altered the ways the government may obtain personal information about its citizens. And, despite initial denial by the New York City Police Department, the Associated Press this August uncovered a partnership with the CIA to monitor Muslim social organizations and religious centers.
Assassination, however, crosses a much starker line. In September, The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled that even seizing the assets of an organization found to be supporting terrorism requires due process. Surely, an assassination must be held to the same or higher standards. Anwar al-Awlaki and Samir Khan should have been indicted and tried in absentia. In the case of Khan in particular, an indictment would have been easy to achieve: In a glossy spread in last year’s second issue of “Inspire” magazine, Khan proudly announces himself as a traitor to America. If, as the administration alleges, they had concrete evidence of al-Awlaki having an active role in attacks against the United States, they should have indicted him during their two-year manhunt in a country with which we are not at war—indeed, a country that boasted about its involvement in the event and may have extradited him alive.
We are incredibly disappointed with the Obama administration over this decision, but we are more gravely concerned about its implications for future presidents and the ever-expanding nature of executive power in the face of terror. Our nation has witnessed a series of abuses of power in times of trouble; the Alien and Sedition Acts, internment of Japanese-Americans, and McCarthyism are illustrative examples. Yet if a professor of Constitutional law is willing to extend executive powers to that of extrajudicial assassination, what should we expect from our future leaders? Indeed, the war on terror appears to have elicited increasingly more flagrant expansions of executive power. With no end to terror in sight, we are left to wonder if these abuses of power are here to stay.
We must question to what extent our actions are actually making us safer. In the 2010 article where Khan announces himself a traitor to our country, he remarked, “I would always laugh whenever the start of Ramadan would occur in America and the President would take a few minutes to articulate on how marvelous Islam is; almost as if he himself was to become Muslim. I would laugh because they would show this face in their country, and a different face in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo Bay.” Indeed, our erratic, extrajudicial, and—frankly—“un-American” actions in the face of terror do not make us safer. These actions weaken us and are fodder for our enemies. For a country that was so careful to hide photos of Osama bin Laden to keep him from becoming a martyr, we may have inadvertently given extremists two more.
Terror, and our response to it, can be more dangerous than the threats themselves. We would do well to reexamine the oft-quoted words from the first inaugural address of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904: “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself—nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.”  Our terror might not be entirely nameless, nor are we retreating, but can we really claim the extrajudicial assassination of two American citizens to be a form of advancement? If we continue to sacrifice our nation’s essence in the war on terror, one wonders what will be left to protect.

A September study by the Center for Social Philanthropy at the Tellus Institute indicates that the 2009 average salary for Harvard executives was more than three times that of any other Massachusetts university. Harvard had an average executive compensation of $4.2 million, compared to $1.2 million for the next highest contender, Boston University.
However, the study released greatly skews the average compensation due to the inclusion of salaries of Harvard Management Company executives. Investment fund managers are often compensated based on the ultimate returns of the asset portfolios. For schools such as Boston  University with an endowment of approximately $1 billion, it makes sense that fund managers are compensated less than at Harvard where the endowment currently stands at $32 billion. Based on commonplace practices that reward financial managers proportionately for the fund performance, the salary earned by HMC executives should come as no surprise. In fact, the 21.4 percent return by HMC in fiscal year 2011 is an achievement when compared to the performance of actively managed private funds and should be appropriately rewarded. The unsettling factor, however, is that the report unfairly suggests that Harvard “executives,” which includes faculty administrators such as University President Drew G.  Faust, earn an exorbitant allowance.
The report also decries the creation of “a new class of highly compensated investment officers on campus,” a Wall Street trend that the Tellus Institute contends should not be prevalent in the non-profit sector. However, without adequate incentives for skilled asset managers, HMC would be unable to attract the talent needed to manage an endowment as large and complicated as Harvard's. In order to support the extensive research facilities, academic programs, and grants offered to all university students, endowment funds need to defray the great impetus for investment managers to join the private sector.
The overarching tendency by forums such as the Tellus Institute to criticize the salaries made by endowment fund managers stems from the belief that these jobs are within the “non-profit” realm, and, therefore, compensation should be accordingly reflective. However, HMC is first and foremost an investment fund, measured by the size of its returns—not the humbleness of its managers. In order to ensure financial stability and continued funding of Harvard's operations, then, we need to attract the best and brightest to lead the endowment's investment strategy. The Tellus Institute's report argues that university endowment management “has been eroded by a Wall Street culture focused on profitable investment returns as if they were central to colleges’ institutional missions.” However, this attitude overlooks the fundamental basis of any college's operations: money. HMC and its executives allow us as Harvard students to enjoy the benefit of attending an educational institution with multitudinous opportunities created by what the Tellus Institute mocks as “profitable investment returns.”
In attracting talent, HMC competes against other premier endowment funds such as that of our neighbor down the river, MIT Investment Management Company, with a $9.9 billion endowment. Just as any other corporation, HMC must and should pay competitive salaries in order to attract and retain the best minds who yearn to work in the non-profit endowment management sector. These individuals have committed to forgo massive salaries managing independent investment funds, and they should be compensated in a manner that reflects the fair market value of their skills. The Tellus Institute's criticism fundamentally overlooks the simple basic concept that—at least in the world of finance—in order to get the best, you must pay accordingly.
We shouldn’t be eager to denounce the salaries earned by those who manage our endowment fund. If anything, we should be thankful for the opportunities HMC creates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The stakes could not be higher for American high schools. For the past decade, policymakers have run public education like a laboratory, trying to figure out how to improve our mediocre educational performance relative to other developed countries. While learning is important for its own sake, a more skilled workforce would be a tremendous boon to the economy. Statistics suggest that achieving a rate of proficiency in math among high school students on par with Canada could boost GDP by $1 trillion in the long run, dwarfing projected gains from other kinds of policy proposals.
Strategies for raising test scores tend to focus on standards for teachers and curricula, but a big part of the solution may lie in getting students to spend less time catching passes and shooting hoops, and more time learning long division. Because of our society’s inordinate promotion of athletics, however, students too often put recreation ahead of learning the skills vital to their own success, and the nation’s.
High school athletic participation is at an all-time high. In the 2010-2011 school year, 7.7 million students—over half of those enrolled in high school—played sports, an increase of almost 40,000 over the previous year. Football and basketball, both notorious for the intense time requirements they impose on student-athletes, together captured over 1.5 million participants.
Sports need not deter academic achievement. Apart from their obvious health benefits and the opportunity they provide to socialize, accumulated research demonstrates a strong positive correlation between athletic participation and good grades. The “dumb-jock” stereotype notwithstanding, students who play sports tend to outperform academically their non-athletic peers. The relationship may not always be causal, but many students—such as my brother, who plays high school football—report that the discipline required by moderate athletic practice helps order their lives in a way that facilitates schoolwork.
Trouble arises when students neglect their grades in favor of athletic training. Several studies have acknowledged the obvious fact that sports tend to divert students’ time from academics, and a 2002 study suggested that the most demanding sports, particularly basketball and football, can be negatively associated with academic achievement.
Since only a miniscule proportion of high school athletes can hope to play at the professional level, why do so many of them place recreation ahead of scholarship? One answer, which was proposed by Harvard’s James S. Coleman in his seminal work analyzing a cross-section of American high schools in 1961, has to do with group dynamics among adolescents. Since grading is relative, Coleman concluded, a student who elevates his own performance by studying hard is ostracized because doing this inevitably lowers the position of his schoolmates. Those who excel in interscholastic sports bring prestige to the school through their success, earning the admiration of their peers. Group dynamics thus work to encourage athletic performance, and discourage achievement in the classroom.
Coleman’s analysis no doubt contains truth, but in 2011 it seems fair to say that the culture at large plays at least as great a role as adolescent group dynamics in promoting sports over studies. Even the private high school I attended in Tennessee, academically one of the best in the state, regularly permits students to miss class for athletic events, both as participants and as spectators, and devotes school hours to parading star athletes in front of the other students. While my school can probably afford its several state-of-the-art athletic facilities, including eight tennis courts for a high school enrollment of less than 500, there are plentiful examples of public schools building football stadiums with price tags in the millions of dollars, even as test scores stagnate and teachers complain about a lack of resources. Local media endlessly hype interscholastic contests, and colleges, which should be the vanguard of academic learning, reinforce devotion to athletics by promoting intercollegiate sports and offering athletic scholarships. Even schools like Harvard lower the admissions bar for talented athletes.
While it is difficult to draw firm conclusions about a culture as diverse as the United States, anecdotal evidence strongly implies that our country has an unhealthy obsession with sports that detracts from the education of a substantial number of high school students. Policymakers might partially correct this by imposing limits on athletic participation, but a cultural defect cannot be eliminated by passing a law. What we need is a sustained nationwide campaign to convince parents, schools, and society at large that although athletics has its place, what goes on in the classroom is of paramount importance to students as well as America’s economy and international competitiveness. Changing a public attitude as entrenched as this one will inevitably be difficult, but we should be encouraged that this issue, for once, is in no way partisan. Democrat or Republican, we should all agree that school comes first.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When addressing Congress, as he has had to do more and more often of late, most recently when outlining the American Jobs Act, the President faces a curious challenge: to be both bold and commonsense, aggressive and uncontroversial.  In order to appease his base and dispel the notion that he is a dithering, compromising leader, he needs to challenge Congress and bludgeon them with the bully pulpit.  Yet, to garner the support of enough Americans to light a fire under the feet of House Republicans, he has to propose ideas so undeniably American that they could make apple pie look French.
Finding the appropriate tenor for his speech must have been a delicate task for the President indeed.  He had to challenge Republicans to adopt policy in such a way that made it seem impossible to argue against him.  When speaking to the American people, Obama relied not on new rhetoric, but on the same, often contradictory, rhetorical tropes that had tremendous success in the 20th century.
Remember those old commercials from the 90s where the “greatest” soft-rock power-ballads of all-time played in fifteen-second clips while the names of the songs scrolled down the screen?  In a sense, the President’s speech, both rhetorically and in content, resembled one such greatest-hits album—for 20th century political movements, that is. He offered a policy proposal—or at least a piece of rhetoric—with roots in every major political era of the 20th century. Since his strategy was to be bold in tone yet centrist in content, he bolstered his proposal by hitching it, both implicitly and explicitly, to the successes of the past. And he did so with surprising thoroughness.
Take the realm of government regulation, for example. Obama attempted to harness the seemingly contradictory legacies of both the Progressive and Reagan eras.  He promised simultaneously to “reject the idea that we must ask people to choose between their work and their safety” on the other to “have no more regulation than the health…and safety of the American People require.” The President was attempting to capitalize on Americans’ idealization of contradictory figures and policies, and it worked.  He came across sounding unafraid to protect the worker, but not ideologically bound to big government.  He was speaking to those independents who voted for Reagan but have since been left behind by the Republicans’ ideological orthodoxy.
In homage to Labor, he spoke of eschewing the notion that “we have to strip away collective bargaining rights to compete in the global economy,” yet he appealed to pro-business conservatism with talk of eliminating the so-called “red-tape” that constrains growth.
The President made it clear that he understands the unfaltering obsession with what we might call “producer-ism” that exists in the American psyche.  When speaking of the economy of the future, he reached into our industrial past.  He spoke of wanting to “see folks in South Korea driving Fords, Chevies, and Chryslers.”  He assured us that “we can be the ones to build fuel efficient cars,” and that the “next generation of manufacturing [will take] root…right here.” It’s clear that he has more faith in the American people’s nostalgia than their trust in the future. Whether there’s any hope for our economy to reclaim the 21st century through industrial production is dubious at best, but Americans like to think so.
In 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904 and former Crimson president, promised that, as U.S. president, he would deliver “bold, persistent experimentation.” During the jobs speech, the President echoed this call, in assuring the public that “what’s guided us from the start…hasn’t been the search for a silver bullet; it’s been a commitment to keep trying.” In a time of deep economic hardship, President Obama recalled the ethos of the FDR, the president who, more than any other, established a personal connection and a trust with the American people. President Obama needs that trust, and he’s borrowing from FDR to find it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a series of meetings Tuesday on Capitol Hill, University President Drew G. Faust will urge members of the so-called Congressional supercommittee to avoid cuts to federal funding for student aid and research as part of efforts to reduce the overall national debt.
Along with Stanford University President John L. Hennessy, Faust will meet with Democratic Congressmen Xavier Becerra of California, James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland. Faust also has tentative plans to meet with Democratic Senator Max Baucus of Montana, who serves as the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, according to Kevin Casey, Harvard’s senior director of federal and state relations.
The super committee is a body of 12 senators and House representatives tasked with shaving at least $1.5 trillion from the national debt over the next ten years.
Harvard receives approximately $600 million per year from the federal government, largely in the form of grants. With funds disbursed to Harvard's teaching hospitals included, annual federal support for the University totals roughly $1.2 billion.
After the 2008 financial crisis dealt a serious blow to Harvard's endowment—which plunged by nearly 30 percent from $36.9 billion to $26 billion—Harvard has increasingly looked to the federal government to help fund science research and student aid.
But this funding is now in jeopardy as a politically divided Congress has become increasingly determined to reduce deficit spending.
Over past year, Faust has made many similar trips to Washington, D.C. for meetings with high-ranking politicians to advocate for research and student aid funding.
"At a moment when important decisions are being considered that will have impacts for years to come, President Faust is meeting with supercommittee members and others to make the case for the critical role universities and industry jointly play in creating an American culture of innovation that should be a featured component of any long term national strategy," Casey wrote in an emailed statement.
The committee, which consists of six Democrats and six Republicans, was created by the debt limit deal passed in early August. The deal cut spending by $2.1 trillion over ten years and allowed for an immediate increase in the nation's debt ceiling.
After fiery debates between Democrats and Republicans in Congress, the deal was enacted just a day before the August 3 deadline on which the United States was projected to begin to default on its sovereign debt.
The super committee must present its proposal for deficit reduction by Nov. 23. The proposal will then be voted on by Congress by Dec. 23. If the bipartisan committee deadlocks and is unable to produce a proposal, then automatic spending cuts totaling $1.2 trillion will take effect.

Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren’s Senate campaign scored two big victories this week with the release of poll numbers that show her in a dead heat with Republican Senator Scott Brown and the announcement Monday of a high-profile endorsement by Massachusetts Congresswoman Niki Tsongas.
Tsongas, who is currently the only woman in the Massachusetts Congressional delegation, announced her endorsement alongside Warren in Lowell—the site of the first Democratic primary debate on Tuesday and a district that is expected to be a difficult win for Warren given its generally conservative working-class population.
“In the Senate, Elizabeth will fight to level the playing field so that you have a voice,” Tsongas said during her endorsement. “She sees an America that invests in people, with educational opportunities that don’t require a lifetime of crushing debt, where entrepreneurs take an idea and start a business without becoming bogged down in red tape, and a place where our sense of fairness dictates that each of us pay our fair share in contributing to our economic recovery.”
At the announcement, Warren echoed the populist themes that have propelled her campaign forward at a rapid rate since the announcement that she would run two weeks ago.
“I am so proud to have earned the support of Niki Tsongas, a fighter for working men and women across the 5th Congressional District,” said Warren at the endorsement announcement. “Together, we will stand up for our middle class families so that for everyone, this is a country of opportunity, where people who work hard have a chance to get ahead, and our children will do better than we do.”
Tsongas’s endorsement comes on the heels of a recent poll that shows Warren overwhelmingly winning the Democratic primary and deadlocked in the race against the Brown.
According to a poll of 1,000 registered voters, Brown currently leads Warren by 41 to 38 percent, which is within the poll’s margin error. According to the same poll, which was conducted by UMass Lowell and The Boston Herald, Warren holds a commanding lead against her Democratic primary opponents, garnering the support of 38 percent of potential Democratic primary voters. None of Warren’s five opponents earned more than 5 percent of the vote in the poll. 40 percent of Democratic voters, however, say they remain undecided.
These numbers are especially encouraging for the Warren camp because 37 percent of respondents said that they had not heard of Warren. Warren has specifically targeted her campaigning at the middle class, a strategy that, so far, seems to track with polling data. 48 percent of voters said they felt that Brown has not done enough to improve economic conditions for the average Massachusetts resident.
Warren announced her campaign in South Boston—a middle and working class district that went heavily in favor of Brown in the special election that followed the death of long-time Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’56-58. In that race, Brown won an upset victory against Attorney General Martha Coakley.
Warren has touted her modest upbringing throughout the campaign, emphasizing that she is the daughter of a maintenance man and that she grew up “on the ragged edge of the middle class,” a message that her surrogates are beginning to latch onto as well.
“Elizabeth has led the fight against predatory lending practices, while championing the rights of homeowners and consumers,” Tsongas said. “And, as she often says, she ‘came up the hard way ... out of a hard-working middle class family,’ which has helped her understand the economic challenges facing working-class communities like the Merrimack Valley.”

Muhammadu Sada Abubakar, the religious leader of Nigeria’s seventy million Muslims, called for interreligious dialogue in the midst of an “atmosphere of mistrust and fear” between Christians and Muslims in the region.
Despite religious and political tensions, “few people have been persecuted for committing an act of violence in Nigeria,” said Abubakar, the sultan of Sokoto, Nigeria, a state in Nigeria’s predominantly Muslim northwest region. “It’s not what the perpetrators of violence do, it’s the actions we take in response that shapes humanity.”
Abubakar spoke on Monday as part of the Samuel L. and Elizabeth Jodidi Lecture Series, an annual set of talks sponsored by the Weatherhead Center.
Abubakar discussed Islam’s long presence in North Africa, pointing out that Islam was well established in Nigeria by the 17th century. Turning to contemporary issues facing people in Nigeria, Abubakar said that education will be a leading mechanism for combatting political and religious tension.
“Education is the key to all our problems,” he said. “We’re doing a lot to empower the children, especially the girls. We have to get up and seek knowledge.”
Abubakar said education can help tackle the major issue of youth unemployment in Nigeria, which has resulted in violence in other regions.
“In many parts of the world, there is abject poverty, neglect, and violence,” Abubakar said. “I have seen the devastation of war in Afghanistan and Pakistan.”
Abubakar said he hopes to change this by promoting a set of values that all people, especially leaders, can abide by. Some of these values include knowledge, integrity, and justice—without resorting to violence.
“Seeing to the welfare of people is more important than the use of force,” he said.
Abubakar said that in order to truly make progress in combatting social problems, policy must target the average person.
“Political strategy must affect the life of the common man. [We should] develop a minimum political agenda to chart the way forward.”
Yet Abubakar said that government policies should not come at the expense of international cooperation and tolerance.
A.Z. Abdu, a staffer at Nigeria’s embassy in Washington D.C., said Abubakar’s lecture “builds bridges between cultures.”
“The Sultan is a very special person who tries to solve the problems of society,” Zango said.

In a world where headlines are dominated by stories of ethnic conflict, gang violence, and acts of terrorism, Harvard Psychology Professor Steven A. Pinker remains optimistic. His latest book, “The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined,” argues that the last few decades have been the most peaceful in human history and examines this development from a psychological perspective.
While this idea may strike many as counter-intuitive, Pinker presents a wealth of statistical evidence demonstrating that the rate of violent deaths has fallen over the course of history.
“There’s a misleading impression if you don’t look at the denominator of the expression—the number of people who are not murdered,” Pinker said. “Only studies that track violence over time give you an accurate impression.”
Twentieth century homicide rates in Europe, for example, show a 10- to 50-fold decrease in homicide rates during the late Middle Ages. Within the last decade, the rate of documented deaths from war, terrorism, genocide, and other political violence has been a fraction of a percentage point.
Combining history with insights from the field of evolutionary psychology, Pinker uses trends in violence as a window into human nature.
Pinker has touched upon the psychology of violence in previous publications but said he was inspired to devote an entire book to the subject when he discovered a large body of research indicating a strong historical trend.
“Violence is a potentially useful way of looking at human nature because it’s present in all societies but in different extents and different roles,” said Dr. John Carter Wood, a historian whose research involves the intersection of criminology and psychology.
According to Wood, who helped provide historical data for Pinker’s book, psychology can inform the study of history in a way that culture and sociology cannot.
“History and the humanities have to take [Pinker’s psychological] argument about human nature seriously. It will help improve our ability to explain things,” Wood said.
In “Better Angels,” Pinker identifies four “better angels”—self-control, empathy, morality, and reason­—which are constantly at odds with our five “inner demons”­—sadism, revenge, dominance, violence in pursuit of practical benefit and violence in pursuit of an ideology.
Pinker argues that while the fundamentals of human nature have remained unchanged, institutional forces such as democracy, effective policing, a fair judicial system, and free commerce have gradually succeeded in suppressing our inner demons.
By pointing out these key features of civilization that people “might otherwise take for granted,” Pinker hopes to inspire confidence in our capacity to live peacefully.
“If you think war will always tear apart countries in Africa and South Asia, then you might become complacent and fatigued,” Pinker said. “But if you are aware of statistics which show that rates of warfare can go down in even the nastiest parts of the world ... then you’re emboldened to try to figure out where you can solve problems.”

With ingredients like flaming gin and tonic powder, liquid nitrogen-aided artificial snow, and a towering hibiscus leaf garnish, chef Grant Achatz is not just reinventing the cocktail, but dramatically shocking it back to life.
Achatz’s wildly creative craft was on display Monday night at the Science Center, where he was an invited guest speaker for the evening lecture series of Science of the Physical Universe 27: “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to the Science of Soft Matter.”
Already one of the most popular courses offered by the College, the associated lecture series, which is open to the general public, is attracting large crowds from all over the Boston area. The 350-seat auditorium filled to capacity just minutes after doors opened, with some eager foodies lining up as early as 5 p.m. for the 7 p.m. event.
Achatz, who won the James Beard Foundation’s highly prestigious “Best Chef in the United States” award in 2008, showed off a few of his culinary innovations in a presentation that was part Food Network, part SyFy.
“[I’m] trying to craft a very emotional experience, and just so happen to be using food to do it,” he said of his culinary motivations.
Much of his work—such as powdered liqueur and drinks that change flavor over time—seems more at home in a Harvard chemistry lab than a bar. For example, Achatz explained the process of creating a solid cocktail, which involves removing the air from the foodstuff in question and replacing it with liquor via an elaborate mechanical process of compression and fluid extraction. Attendees were lucky enough to taste the result: under every seat was a small paper box containing a chunk of pineapple infused with cucumber, gin, and chartreuse.
“We had to embrace science and technology in order to manipulate the foodstuffs in new, exciting ways,” Achatz explained to a spellbound audience.
For the scientists in the audience, Science and Cooking professor David A. Weitz gave a short lecture detailing the more technical aspects of crafting specific textures in food, emphasizing concepts such as viscoelasticity and polymer cohesion.
Aschatz’s futuristic bartending was lauded by scientists and aesthetes alike.
Boston-area chef Michael Zenter said he enjoyed the presentation, describing it as “very informative.”
Said Kieran A. McLaughlan, a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and self-identified foodie, “I wanted to see great chefs go to work and knew this was the place to do it.”

Standing in front of the 50 students in her education reform course, Graduate School of Education Professor Katherine K. Merseth told her students, “If you’re not outraged, you’re not paying attention” to the state of American education.
Merseth teaches United States in the World 35: “Taking a Stand: Dilemmas of Equity and Excellence in American K-12 Education,” the first course to be offered exclusively for undergraduates at the Ed School.
Though there has been a growing interest in education reform at the College—evidenced by the 18 percent of the Class of 2011 that applied to Teach for America—U.S. in the World 35 is one of the few courses on education available to undergraduates.
The class, which drew far greater interest than many anticipated, is designed “to bring education more into focus for undergraduates,” Merseth said.
But beyond just exposing students to opportunities in education at Harvard and the broader world, the course also represents a move for greater collaboration between Harvard’s different schools.
According to Merseth, University President Drew G. Faust spoke with Ed School Dean Kathleen McCartney last year about her desire to create an undergraduate course about education reform to be offered at the Ed School.
McCartney then asked Merseth if she would be interested in teaching the class.
Faust’s interest in the new Gen Ed course is a reflection of her overarching goal for the University, Director of the Program in General Education Stephanie H. Kenen said.
“The president is being very proactive as part of her ‘One University’ initiative,” Kenen said, referring to Faust’s stated mission to foster greater collaboration between Harvard’s different schools.
Kenen added that Faust has been talking to deans and faculty members across the University about designing programs to teach undergraduates.
According to Kenen, the College is required to fund a portion of the salaries of many of the graduate school faculty who teach courses for undergraduates.
To help offset these costs, Faust has  asked graduate school deans to contribute resources to the College, Kenen said.
Faust “is trying to encourage the deans of the other schools to, in some ways, ‘donate’ an appropriate course,” she added.
Merseth said she believes the scarcity of education courses available to undergraduates can be attributed to the College’s traditional focus on liberal arts.
“Historically, the College has been very careful about what one might call vocational studies,” Merseth said.
Although the Ed School offers the Undergraduate Teacher Education Program, which allows College students to simultaneously obtain a teaching degree and a bachelor’s degree from Harvard, Merseth said there is limited awareness of the program at the College.
“I can run into ten undergraduates, and six of them don’t even know that there’s an undergraduate teacher education program,” said Merseth. “It hasn’t been visible.”
Although Merseth said she would like to see education courses have a greater presence on campus, she added that she would not support a concentration in education studies because she thinks that undergraduate preprofessional studies “can get very fluffy.”
Instead, she said she encourages students to explore their academic interests in college, and those passionate about education should pursue the subject in graduate school.
Even in its inaugural year, the course has already proved to be a popular offering. Almost 90 undergraduates expressed interest in the class, forcing Merseth to hold a lottery in order to bring enrollment down to 47 students.
According to data provided by the teaching staff, at least 19 different concentrations—ranging from literature to applied mathematics—are represented in the course.
“It’s a totally different way of thinking about teaching. It’s much more creative,” said Ashtynn B. Baltimore ’13, who added that the class is the best course she has taken at Harvard.
According to some enrollees, the course is also increasing awareness of education-related opportunities at Harvard.
Jyoti Jasrasaria ’12, who is studying in the Undergraduate Teacher Education Program, said she has given information about the program to half a dozen fellow students in the class.
Merseth said she is passionate about helping her students become education advocates, no matter what career they choose to pursue.
“I’m on a personal crusade” to build up interest in education reform, Merseth said. “I’m desperate about it, I’m frantic about it.”

Harvard Law School has concluded the first phase of an investigation into what workers called discriminatory labor practices, including unfairly firing longtime employees and requiring those who speak Spanish to learn English.
The Law School initially launched the investigation after a delegation of custodial workers from the Law School went to Dean Martha Minow’s office almost two weeks ago and submitted a letter of complaint. Dean Minow authorized the investigation almost immediately.
The first phase of the investigation involved interviewing a large number of Law School administrators. The Law School is slated to begin a second round of interviews, though the University declined to comment on the nature of the discussions.
The alleged practices, according to the letter, began approximately six months ago, just after an unidentified administrator was hired by the Law School.
Leaders within SEIU Local 615, the union representing Harvard custodians, said they were pleased with the University’s quick response to their complaint.
“Obviously, this is very good,” Wayne M. Langley, director of higher education for Local 615, said of the University finishing the first portion of its investigation. “We’re really happy with the progress that the University is making.”
Custodians on the delegation hope this process will lead to a quick improvement in job quality.
“Hopefully, since the investigation is going so quickly, we’ll be able to work in a better place very soon,” said one member of the delegation, who wished to remain anonymous to protect his relationship with his employer.
The University declined to comment on the ongoing investigation but said it is treating the complaint as a matter of great importance.
“We take allegations of discrimination very seriously,” University spokesperson Kevin Galvin wrote in an email statement. “Representatives of the Law School and the University’s Office of Labor and Employee Relations are meeting directly with union representatives and the staff members involved in order to gather information about the complaint.”
Langley said that he appreciates the seriousness with which the University is treating the investigation. He emphasized the importance of the University and union continuing to work together to come to a solution.
“It’s very important that they are keeping us updated—they’re sticking to their word,” Langley said. “Together we can hopefully come to a solution to this issue.”
Langley said that while the complaint comes in the midst of custodial contract negotiations between Local 615 and the University, it is unlikely to influence contract discussions.
“They’ve responded appropriately and we’re very pleased with that,” Langley said. “Everything should proceed smoothly.”

Tara A. Gianoulis will be remembered by friends and colleagues for her exceptional contributions to the field of bioinformatics, her impressive athletic achievements, and her altruistic approach to life. A postdoctoral fellow at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard, Gianoulis died on Friday morning after a longtime battle with bipolar disorder, according to friends and colleagues. She was 30.
Gianoulis was a native of Staten Island, New York, where she graduated from CUNY College of Staten Island before completing her doctorate at Yale in computational biology and bioinformatics in 2009.
Her co-advisers at Yale—Michael P. Snyder, then-director of the Yale Center of Genomics and Proteomics, and Mark B. Gerstein ’89, professor of biomedical informatics—both recalled Gianoulis’ leadership and drive while working on her graduate degrees.
She made significant contributions to the field of bioinformatics, developing novel methods for studying genetics using mathematical models, according to Gerstein.
Her Yale mentors introduced her to George M. Church, professor of genetics at the Harvard Medical School. She joined Church’s lab as a postdoctoral fellow in the fall of 2009.
“She was simply brilliant and energetic,” Church said.
Before her death, Gianoulis emphasized that her own struggle with mental illness should be communicated and used to educate the public, according to Church.
“She had the rare potential to change the face of science, and had a positive effect on everyone who came in contact with her,” A. Michael Sismour, a close friend who worked in Church’s lab, wrote in an email. “What I will miss most about Tara is inconsequential, it is the world that is at a loss today.”
Gianoulis was interested in how microbial life survived extreme environments and traveled to places with extraordinary weather conditions to collect samples to study. In December 2008, she visited the coast of Chile, and in January 2010, Gianoulis tackled Antarctica.
“Yes, Antarctica is mostly a blinding white, making good sunglasses a must, but the microbial world is busy painting the landscape other colors,” Gianoulis wrote in a January 2010 blog post about her experience.
Gianoulis had been planning a trip to the Malaysian side of Borneo this fall, Church said.
“I think it’s fair to say that on a sheer social level ... it’s quite impressive the interactions she had,” said Gerstein, reflecting on her numerous co-authored papers and collaboration with highly regarded researchers in the field. “She certainly wasn’t the student who hung out in the cubby hole.”
Outside of her academic work, Gianoulis was a dedicated athlete who participated in marathons and triathalons.
“I was quite taken by her energy and thirst for life, both in science and beyond,” Gerstein wrote in a letter to his lab upon hearing of Gianoulis’ death. “I fondly remember our discussions on cycling and sports, and I hope her signature vitality lives on in some fashion.”
Gianoulis’ compassion extended beyond her academics and research, recalled her lab colleague Sriram Kosuri. She repeatedly invited international students for Thanksgiving dinner, Kosuri said.
“She was so extremely positive about her attitude toward life and her attitude toward projects,” Kosuri said. “She was so nice, so giving, and it really was surprising how much she was going through during that time.”
A memorial service will be held for Gianoulis in New York on Oct. 15.

Collaboration in renewable energy between the United States and India is crucial to maintaining the pre-eminence of both countries on the international stage, according to panelists at a Harvard College Global Energy Initiative-sponsored event on Monday night.
The panel, titled “Igniting U.S.-India Renewable Energy Collaboration and Innovation,” brought together three experts in the field of renewable energy: President and CEO of green non-profit invVest Probir Ghosh, invVest Ambassador for Alternative Energy for Transportation Vinod Kumar, and senior adviser to the World Bank Dilip R. Limaye.
With the consequences of climate change looming, the panelists emphasized the importance of renewable resources, arguing that climate change can be addressed while ensuring economic growth.
“Increasing energy efficiency is absolutely the most cost-effective way to reduce the energy supply and demand gap while also mitigating climate change,” said Limaye.
The panelists also drew connections between the transition to cleaner energy and maintaining the influence of the United States and India on the world stage—especially in light of China’s “unprecedented” economic growth, Ghosh said.
According to the panelists, China’s burgeoning economic power stems in part from the country’s ability to decree economic policy in ways that India and the United States cannot.
“In China, you do what the government says or you’re arrested. In India, we don’t have that kind of system,” Limaye said.
“As two slow-moving democracies, the question is: how can we be more competitive than China?” asked Ghosh, noting the opportunities for India to learn from American innovation and technical expertise and for American companies to invest in renewable resources in India.
“The two largest democratic societies in the world have a great opportunity to work together in this area,” he added.
The panelists concluded by stressing the importance of student activism in promoting energy efficiency.
“Your personal involvement can make a huge difference in the lives of people in emerging countries,” said Ghosh.
Riju Agrawal ’13, the event’s organizer, echoed Ghosh’s sentiments, adding that one of the goals of the Global Energy Initiative is to empower students to get involved.
“The intent of this event was to help students understand that energy issues are not unique to the United States. India and the United States both need solutions, leading to natural synergy and cooperation,” Agrawal said. “Unless students do something, all this talk doesn’t amount to much.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three Harvard graduates were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics today for their joint-discovery that the universe is not only expanding, but constantly accelerating—a discovery that shook the cosmology world by overturning the common belief that the universe was slowing down.
Saul Perlmutter ’81, Adam G. Riess—who received his master’s degree and Ph.D in astronomy from Harvard in 1994 and 1996, respectively—and Brian P. Schmidt—who received a master’s and Ph.D in astronomy from Harvard in 1992 and 1993, respectively—worked in two teams in 1998 to study a special type of Supernova known as the expanding star. They concluded separately that a mysterious force, referred to as “dark energy,” is forcing galaxies to move away from one another at a surprising rate.
Permultter and Reiss were rivals in uniquely using a particular sub-category of supernovae, or an exceptionally large explosion of a star, to gauge the span of the universe, which was born 14 billion years ago. The study seems to refute thinking that the Universe might implode on itself, what is popularly called the "Big Crunch."
“The discovery that this expansion is accelerating is astounding,” the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the prize, said in a release. “The acceleration is thought to be driven by dark energy, but what that dark energy is remains an enigma – perhaps the greatest in physics today.”
The discovery also enables scientists to predict what the universe may be like in the future—ice, low temperatures, and dark skies interrupted by the light emitted from galaxies as they travel away from each other at a rapid speed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
LOWELL, Mass.—Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren emerged unscathed—but not the clear victor—in the first real test of her fledgling Senate campaign at a debate Tuesday night at UMass Lowell.
Warren faced off against the five other candidates for the Massachusetts Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate last night at a debate that heavily featured populist rhetoric and repeated calls for job creation. The need for tax reform—especially higher taxes on the wealthy—was another reoccurring theme, and in nearly every response candidates tried to circle back to the economy and the broken financial system.
“Like a lot of people in this audience I worked hard for everything I got,” Warren said. “I grew up in an America that was full of opportunity. We have lost our way.”
Alan Khazei ’83, arguably Warren’s most significant opponent, said that he would push for a home price insurance system and would help alleviate the home foreclosure crisis.
“Together we can put the American dream back in the hands of those who invented it,” Khazei said.
Members of the audience agreed that the economy was their number one concern and factor in determining their vote.
“It’s not just jobs, but good jobs,” said Dan McCarthy, a lawyer from Malden who was in the audience. “We need to find a way to get back on track.”
In one of the clearest examples of the evening’s populist overtones, Immigration attorney Marisa DeFranco said she was in the race “to fight for the people against the powerful.” DeFranco received a round of applause when she mentioned the importance of supporting and maintaining union jobs.
“We have a fundamentally broken system because of the money that is corrupting our politics,” said candidate Bob Massie, co-founder of the Global Reporting Initiative.
Candidate Herb Robinson, who has sold himself as “a regular American” said that one of his top priorities is “making Main Street American a better place for all of us.”
Warren, who played up her focus on the middle class at every turn, told the audience that she grew up “on the ragged edge of the middle class.” That phrase is quickly becoming something of a campaign slogan for Warren, who repeatedly used the term on-stage and off while shaking hands with supporters and carrying out post-debate interviews.
Warren’s experience in consumer finance setting up the recently minted Consumer Financial Protection Bureau played well with the audience.  “I stood toe to toe with these institutions,” Warren said of big banks, to an enthusiastic round of applause. “We need to stand up on behalf of middle class families.”
And that message seems to be playing well with voters.
“Banks hate her; Wall Street hates her,” said Marilyn Sicurella.
“And that’s why we love her,” interjected Elizabeth Twombly, a delegate to the Democratic convention,
The candidates were asked whether or not they would support Occupy Wall Street, a grassroots protest movement that has gathered momentum in the last week with demonstrations nationwide.
Warren stopped just short of endorsing the movement, emphasizing instead that Occupy Wall Street is a symptom of widespread frustration among Americans with the state of the economy and financial institutions.
“The people on Wall Street broke this country and they did it one mortgage at a time,” Warren said. “There is still no basic accountability.”
Warren came under heat when Massie called on her to refuse to accept funding from political action committees—a particularly hot topic after the Citizens United ruling transformed campaign finance law, making it legal for organizations to support a candidate through funds from their general treasuries.
Massie said he would reverse Citizens United if elected.
Warren has largely been considered a frontrunner in the campaign after she joined the race two weeks ago. Throughout the debate her responses were met with resounding applause, though she did not appear to emerge with a definite win.
“She didn’t outshine her opponents,” said McCarthy, the Malden lawyer. “I was impressed with almost all of them.”
Several audience members wore Warren campaign stickers and said they would vote for her.
“She’s on message—a message that I agree with.” said Chris Zellner, a public high school English teacher from Bedford. “She’s got a track record of public service and as a symbol she’s fantastic.”
The debate featured all six of the Democratic candidates. Although the debate was held at UMass Lowell, the city is a largely conservative, working class town that may be difficult for Warren win over.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a new weekly feature, The Crimson will be tracking the successes (and potential failures) of some of Harvard’s most successful graduates not to use their Harvard degrees. While a tour through professional sports is not exactly a who’s who of Harvard alumni, a few athletes have taken their game to the next level. From Jeremy Lin to Ryan Fitzpatrick, the Crimson maintains a presence outside of the labs and law offices of the world.
This week’s alumni tracker takes us back to the NFL where former Harvard quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 suffered his first loss of the 2011 season.
Entering Sunday’s action, Fitzpatrick was coming off his best month of football since graduation. He received the AFC Offensive Player of the Month honor for September and entered the day with the NFL’s leading offense.
Fitzpatrick’s Buffalo Bills got off to a slow start in Sunday’s matchup with Cincinnati Bengals, but kicked into gear in the second quarter. Helped by a “pick 6” from safety Bryan Scott, the Bills went on a 17-0 run to close out the half and entered the locker room with a 17-3 lead.
But unfortunately for Fitzpatrick and the Bills, Buffalo followed up with its worst half of the season and fell on a 43-yard, last-second field goal from Bengals’ kicker Mike Nugent.
If there’s any question whether the Bills follow the lead of their starting QB, that became clear on Sunday. Fitzpatrick passed for under 200 yards for the first time in the 2011 season and failed to complete any touchdown passes in the loss.
Despite taking their first loss of the season, the Bills remain in first place in the AFC East and will be taking on the struggling Eagles next Sunday. Tune in next week to see how Fitzpatrick rebounds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off its first victory at the Professor Steadman Hood Trophy last week, the Harvard sailing team was unable to repeat its success at either the Danmark Trophy or the Charles River Invitational this past weekend.
With the women’s squad not competing in any events, the sailing team’s focus lay on the co-eds.
The squad travelled to New London, Conn., to compete at the Danmark Trophy—hosted by the Coast Guard Academy—and came away with a ninth-place finish out of the field of 20 schools.
The seventh-ranked Crimson also hosted the one-day Charles River Invitational, an in-conference regatta on Sunday, where it placed 14th out of 15 teams.
DANMARK TROPHY
The co-ed team opened the weekend on Saturday facing fair weather conditions. With enough wind and manageable current, six races were run in the morning.
The afternoon presented slightly more difficult conditions, with less wind and a strong flood tide, but both the A and B divisions were able to get in four races to close the day.
Co-captain Brendan Kopp, paired with sophomore crew Sarah Pierson, skippered for the A-Division team. The duo sailed to six top-10 finishes on Saturday and seven overall, ending the weekend in 10th place with 124 points.
“I personally had an okay day on Saturday,” Kopp said. “We were in fourth and pretty close to the second- and third-place teams, but I just had a terrible day on Sunday, and so we dropped because of that.”
“My crew, Sarah, sailed incredibly well also,” he continued. “She’s gotten better every week.”
For the B-Division team, senior Emily Lambert and freshman Reid Bergsund sailed for Harvard. The duo had five top-10 finishes of its own during the regatta and concluded the weekend with 132 points, good for 11th place in the field of 20.
The conditions on Sunday were more difficult, with a very light breeze only allowing for three races to be completed.
The day was highlighted by a first-place finish for the B-Division squad.
“Emily and Reid in B-Division sailed quite well,” Kopp said. “They won the race on the last day, and that was good … [because they raced] against tougher people than they have sailed against so far.”
Harvard finished the weekend with an overall score of 256 points, good for ninth place.
Hobart and William Smith Colleges finished first in the regatta with 153 points, followed by Tufts and Yale.
CHARLES RIVER INVITATIONAL
On Sunday, the Crimson hosted 14 other schools at the Charles River Invitational.
But even though Harvard was the host of the regatta, there was not much of a home-water advantage due to the difficult conditions and the relative inexperience of the various freshmen who competed.
“The conditions were pretty shifty,” sophomore Diana Powell said. “It was really windy sometimes, which was great, but we had [little] wind for a couple races. … The conditions slowly got worse. We were also sailing with a lot of freshmen who aren’t totally used to sailing on the Charles yet … so I’d say it’s not really much of an advantage being home.”
The squad encountered even more challenges in this regatta, facing off against very strong opposing teams, all with more experience than the young Crimson co-eds.
Freshmen Ansel Duff and Ashleigh Inglis sailed in the A-Division for Harvard, finishing the day’s five races with 63 points and a 14th-place finish. Powell and freshman skipper Kendra Norton ended the event in 13th place in the B-Division with 62 points.
“I thought that we did pretty well,” Powell said. “It was a lot of people’s first regattas, and definitely for their first regatta, they did a pretty good job.”
Vermont was the day’s champion with 31 points, surpassing Boston University and Bowdoin, which rounded out the top three.
Despite the less-than-stellar finish, the team was pleased with its growth and improvement.
“In practices we’ve really focused on getting good starts in races, and I feel like our starting tactics were really good in this regatta,” Powell said. “I feel like you get the best at sailing at the regattas, so the more experience people have the better our team’s going to be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Ultimate frisbee,” she said. “It’s pretty much my life.”
I was sitting down with some girls on my floor on one of the first Mondays of my sophomore year, and I had asked the generic question, “What kind of activities do you do on campus?”
I was already good friends with a member of Quasar, the women’s ultimate team, so I had an idea of the kind of commitment it took to be part of that squad. But I was still surprised and impressed when I saw how much time it took for her to plan and fundraise for the team’s trip to Vegas that year.
Was captaining a competitive club team really a smaller commitment than the ones made by varsity athletes? And were our decisions to join crew and frisbee so different? We had both been high school runners—she a better one than I, from what I’ve heard—looking to play sports in college. And we both found different areas where we could pour our dedication and determination.
And it’s not just between athletes of different sports that I can find parallels. This year, one of my roommates is very active in dancing on campus.
I’ve never attempted to pursue dancing, unless you count a couple of ballet lessons when I was really young (my mom enticed me by saying football players did it), so learning about her ballroom and breakdancing has allowed me to expand my horizons.
But it’s not as if we talk about dance, take a break, and then talk about rowing. Instead, we usually end up talking about them at the same time. As athletic pursuits, their objectives are about as far away from each other as possible, but the preparations are remarkably similar. We talk about staying in shape, building strength, and being in sync with teammates.
Far from expressing different opinions formed from our different activities, we often seem to be saying the same thing to each other.
Our Harvard careers have followed similar story lines.
We both picked up our activities when we got to college, and both of us got swept in pretty quickly. My roommate spent three years on the ballroom team and was president for one year. This fall, she’s joined the Harvard Breakers.
Both of us spend much of our day practicing and thinking about activities we had never tried before we got to campus. I don’t know whether that’s fate or random chance or what. Sure, the odds of me being a dancer were probably pretty low. But what if something else had caught my eye before I made up my mind to be a college athlete? How might my life had been different if I’d actually made travel soccer? What if I’d watched “Mighty Ducks” before “Space Jam”? Would I have played hockey in high school?
Through a simple list of questions, it’s easy to see how our current positions have a lot to do with luck.
Joining activities are some of the best ways to meet new friends and discover commonalities. But I think it’s really important that we not think we are somehow special because we participate in them. I don’t consider the Crimson athlete a subspecies separate from the rest of the college community. Harvard, as a school, is fundamentally driven toward excellence, and so are all of its students whether that excellence comes in soccer, math, singing, or government—or in some cases, all of the above (in which case, good for you!).
I think any kind of supposed divide between student-athletes and the rest of the student body is largely fabricated and artificial. I’ve read articles debating the relative merits of athletics and academics, but I don’t see how the two are exclusive.
As a member of the athletic community, I don’t feel any greater obligation to attend athletic games than I do to participate in House events or go to my friends’ a cappella concerts. And I’ve been lucky enough to get to know people who are involved in a wide variety of activities on campus.
The beauty of college is that you don’t have to choose. Sure, you only have a limited amount of time, and you can’t participate in every activity. But you can work to get to know people whose list of campus activities seems completely different than yours.
You might learn to take a new perspective on things, you might learn you’re not so different after all, or you might just find out about more events with free food.
You can’t really go wrong.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For two years, Harvard field hockey coach Sue Caples didn’t lose any sleep over who she had defending her team’s goal. As Cynthia Tassopoulos enters the heart of her junior season in net, it is the Crimson goalkeeper who now has opposing coaches tossing and turning.
Through nine games, Tassopoulos has posted the fifth highest save percentage in the nation while leading Harvard to a 6-3 record—its best start since 2004. Tassopoulos turned in her strongest performance of the year this past weekend, allowing just one goal in a pair of wins over Brown and Vermont.
“Cynthia is playing fabulously,” co-captain Georgia McGillivray said. “She is always very strong. She is our rock.”
Tassopoulos has started every game since her arrival at Harvard and finished her rookie campaign ranked seventh in the country with 8.82 saves per game.
“She came in incredibly solid,” co-captain Carly Dickson said.  “No one would have guessed that she was a freshman. She always looked like she had the experience.”
Building off the confidence she gained during her first season at the NCAA level, Tassopoulos continued to anchor the Crimson in goal as a sophomore. Playing every minute of every game during her second season, Tassopoulos garnered the team’s Most Valuable Player award and was selected to the All-Ivy second team.
“She is very solid, and she gives everyone confidence on the field,” Dickson said. “Everyone trusts her so much, and she is such a great leader on the field.”
Tassopoulos is once again playing a vital role for Harvard as a junior.  This past weekend was no exception, as she backed the team to home victories over Brown and Vermont. According to her teammates, it’s not only her goalkeeping abilities which make her a valuable asset, but also her communication skills.
“She is an authority on the field,” McGillivray said. “She plays a huge role not only making incredible saves, but she is constantly communicating and organizing us so we are all in the right place at the right time.”
On Saturday, the Crimson defeated the Bears, 4-0, as Tassopoulos recorded her second shutout of the year.  In the first half, Brown came on strong, utilizing its counter-attack to record 10 shots on goal. But Tassopoulos kept her team in control by stopping each and every attempt that came her way.
“I feel completely confident with my defense in front of me,” Tassopoulos said. “We have really been able to limit the number of shots and corners, which has been a great improvement from last year.”
Tassopoulos faced her biggest challenge of the weekend with 1:04 to go in the first half, when the Bears were awarded a penalty stroke.
But just like all the other shots she faced that afternoon, Tassopoulos turned the attempt away.
“I was trying to stay very calm,” Tassopoulos said. “We have been working on strokes during practice, so I felt good going into it. I felt like I was prepared. I was excited to keep us in the game [with the save].”
The crucial stop allowed Harvard to go into the half with newfound energy.
“The [penalty stroke save] was crazy,” McGillivray said.  “Strokes go in almost every time, and it was such a clutch save.  It is always incredible when goalies save penalty strokes, because it is very rare, and it causes a big shift in momentum.”
Tassopoulos didn’t ease up in the second half, finishing the day with a 12-save shutout and helping the Crimson capture the 4-0 victory.
On Sunday, Tassopoulos led her team to its fourth consecutive win at Jordan Field when the Crimson defeated the Catamounts in overtime, 2-1. Harvard dominated possession, while Tassopoulos held down the back, notching three saves and allowing only one goal.
“She has good game sense,” Dickson said. “She is great at getting the ball, and she is a smart player—always in a good position.”
The way she’s playing, look for Tassopoulos to keep giving opposing coaches nightmares for the foreseeable future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After suffering what appeared at the time to be a minor hamstring injury, senior quarterback Collier Winters has not appeared in a game since the season opener Sept. 17.
It now looks like he might be out for a little while longer. Winters confirmed that he would be out for this week's game against Cornell.
"I sat down with our trainer, Brant Berkstresser, and our head coach today, and [we] discussed the options, trying to see where I was at with my rehab and everything, and how I was feeling," Winters said. "And I’m not quite back to 100 percent yet, so I think they’re going to let my try and heal up one week, and rest up, and my goal will be to play next week."
Earlier today, the starting quarterback tweeted that he would find out about his status for this Saturday’s start at Cornell within an hour.
A little before that, he posted in reference to some of the treatment he’s undergone over the last two weeks: “I no longer hav ne hair on the back of my leg due to all the medical treatment Ive had dun on it the last 2 weeks#TheyTryToMakeMeGoToRehab.”
But he remains optimistic that he will be available to start in two weeks against Bucknell.
"I’m feeling pretty good—I was running around pretty good today," Winters said. [I'm] still not quite 100 percent yet, but I think Bucknell’s definitely a reasonable goal."
In his absence this weekend, Winters said that junior Colton Chapple will make the start.
This is the second year in a row that Harvard’s quarterbacks have had trouble staying healthy.
Just three games into the 2011 season, sophomore third-string quarterback Michael Pruneau played in the second half of Saturday’s game at Lafayette.
Chapple, Winters’ backup who started the second and third games of the season, left the Oct. 1 game with back cramps after halftime.
The Crimson faces injury trouble on the defensive end as well. Senior linebacker Blaise Deal went down in the first game of the year against Holy Cross, and he may be out for the rest of the season.

Shock and horror quickly spread through the College this weekend, when an attack of senseless vandalism left the Science Center's much-beloved Winnie-the-Pooh tree in shambles. The tree—which, in happier times, bore a crimson sign, inscribed "Pooh" and a hinged wooden door—remains intact. Meanwhile, Pooh's lone entryway has been badly damaged.
"Who would do that?" asked an Economics concentrator, who, no doubt fearing retaliation from the forces of evil responsible for the crime, wished to remain anonymous. "He's a staple in our school, and we all look forward to seeing him. We're always stressed out, but he cheers us up."
HUPD has confirmed, via email, that no formal reports of the offense have been filed. So, for now, the perpetrator remains at large and the mystery of his identity, unsolved.
Notes of condolence can be sent to the 100 Acre Wood, c/o Christopher Robin.
