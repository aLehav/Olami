The unifying element in all 12 short stories of Javier Marías’ most recently translated collection, “While the Women Are Sleeping,” is the fantastic. By breathing life to a series of unlikely characters, including a dead narrator and a murderous lover, Marías lends a tinge of the unreal to each story. The unexpected serves not only to entertain and delight, but also to establish a vast, creative space. “While the Women are Sleeping,” a collection of tales written by MarÌas from 1965—when he was 16—to 1998, is a series of stories that are at once humorous, thoughtful, and imaginative.
The titular story, which features a man named Alberto Viana and his younger lover Inés, is narrated in the first person by a frank observer, setting the tone for the anthology. The narrator moves naturally, if idiosyncratically, between somber observations about love and comic asides. Within one paragraph, he says, “I think what drove us to seek out their company was that they offered us a rare sight, one from which it’s always hard to look away: the spectacle of one human being adoring another,” and in quick succession, “her bikini bottom was minuscule and revealed that she was entirely free of hair, which made one think (well, made me think) that she must have had a Brazilian wax before she arrived.” This rounded narrator brings attention to the eccentric and unpredictable turns that any commonplace thought could take.
Through this unusual voice, Marías tells a story whose most prominent aspect is the possibility that gleams through the actuality of what is told. “While the Women are Sleeping” is uncanny and memorable because of the unwritten ideas to which the work alludes. Viana, speaking to the narrator, asks, “how do you know it’s not Inès who has died at my hands, and that’s why I shaved off my mustache, a while ago, before you came down, before I came down?” One can only wonder if Viana’s bizarre comments––“She will have to die before me, when I can no longer stand my adoration of her. One day I’ll have to kill her, don’t you see?”––actually amount to a larger, tragic reality. A vast space for what is possible is created yet never fulfilled, allowing the elegant air of unfulfilled potential to linger even after the story’s finish.
Marías uses this technique through much of the collection. In “An Epigram of Fealty” Mr. James Lawson, the manager of a prestigious rare bookstore, encounters a homeless man who claims to be John Gawsworth, to whom Dylan Thomas dedicated a series of poems. Mr. Lawson does not believe him and sends him away, but the last lines in the story betray a mysterious suggestion of what is unlikely but possible: “A copy of ‘An Epigram of Fealty’ bearing John Gawsworth’s signature would be worth twice as much. A thousand pounds, he thought. Lawson looked up, but the window was still empty.”
Marías explores possibilities rather than actualities with his characters as well. John Gawsworth is a person in real life and a writer who claimed to be the King of Redonda, a small island not recognized as its own country. In stories like “The Resignation Letter of Señor de Santiesteban” and “The Life and Death of Marcelino Iturriaga” Marías takes this space-creating method to another level by introducing ghosts as the main characters. These fantastic characters are real within the stories, but by their natures as “undead” humans without bounds, they are the perfect vessels to carry limitless possibilities. The ghost narrator of “The Life and Death of Marcelino Iturriaga” gives a brief summary of his life from his grave, but ends the tale by saying “this is my life and my death, where there is nothing.” However, because he can speak beyond the grave, the nothingness is in fact a space that must be filled by what will be the unwritten but ongoing narrative of Marcelino Iturriaga.
Tellingly, Marías explicitly references the literary technique mise en abîme in the story “Lord Rendall’s Song.” The French term, which translates to “placing into infinity,” is often used to describe the never-ending image produced by standing between two mirrors. In stories like “Lord Rendall’s Song” and “Gualta” Marías doubles the main character. The narrator of “Lord Rendall’s Song” comes back from a war to find himself of four years ago in his house. He sees what could have been had he not gone to war through his own window. In “Gualta,” the narrator meets an exact replica of himself, in both looks and mannerisms. Wanting to distinguish himself from his double, he slowly changes himself into someone else, leaving behind what is real about his identity for what is completely beyond the bounds of what he has thus far known.
The narrative structures of “Lord Rendall’s Song” and “What the Butler Said” are also instances of mise en abîme. Both of these stories are prefaced by a story behind the story. It becomes impossible to tell where the author ends and the narrator begins, between what is real and what is fictive.
The force of “While the Women Are Sleeping” comes from Marías’ method of provoking the imagination. By leaving room for the reader’s own idiosyncratic interpretations, the tales leave a marked impression. By highlighting the possible and constructing the fantastic, Javier Marías has created, in 12 short stories, a playground for the imagination.

5. Thumper from “Bambi”
Despite its tearful beginning, “Bambi” was one of my favorite childhood movies. In my opinion, Thumper upstages Bambi in pretty much any scene they share.
4. The rabbit in “Goodnight Moon”
This book should not need explanation. It has been a bedtime story for countless children, and at its center is a baby rabbit trying to go to sleep.
3. The killer rabbit from “Monty Python and the Holy Grail”
Not all rabbits are as sweet and innocent as the one falling asleep in “Goodnight Moon.” This particular rabbit eats unsuspecting travelers alive.
2. Harvey from “Harvey”
If you can’t see a rabbit, does it exist? Directed by Henry Koster and starring Jimmy Stewart, “Harvey” is the story of a man named Elwood P. Dowd, who claims to have a six-foot-tall, invisible rabbit friend.
1. Fiver from “Watership Down”
There are enough rabbits in Richard Adams’ classic tale to warrant a separate list. There’s the leader of the group of runaway rabbits, Hazel, the rabbit-god Frith, and the Grim Reaper rabbit, the Black Rabbit of Inlé, to name only a few. But Fiver, the neurotic and somewhat psychic runt of the group, has always been my favorite.

Kanye West has been accused of a lot of things, but moderation is not one of them. His first album, 2004’s “The College Dropout,” took popular music by storm. With “Slow Jamz” and “Through the Wire,” West launched a two-single assault on the charts, pushing himself to the forefront of popular music. It feels natural, then, that his latest opens with a bombastic fusion of grimy hip-hop verses and a soaring, cello-driven chorus—a promise of stubborn refusal to compromise that the following twelve tracks keep.
From the opener “Dark Fantasy” through the end of the album, “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy” gives the impression that West had to decide between seemingly diametrically opposed stylistic options. The album alternates between the gritty and the luxuriant, the raw hip-hop of “Monster” and the Auto-Tune laden restraint of “Runaway.” Where others might see boundaries and limitations West sees opportunity for constructive combination. “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy” proves that West—who completed this album while releasing additional new songs weekly via his blog and recording a collaborative album with Jay-Z due early next year—is one of the rare artists with the talent, tenacity, and sheer creative energy to turn unlikely fusion into persuasive triumph.
The no-holds-barred production and lyrical bravado of “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy” may seem almost impersonal to the listener unaware of West’s recent publicity mishaps, from his infamous interruption of Taylor Swift—which inspired the second single “Runaway”—to his recently resolved dispute with former President George W. Bush. However, seen in the context of these missteps, “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy” becomes a self-vindication that could never have succeeded were it not for the very same insatiable ambition and unflappable ego that brought about the decline of his public image. The beat to the album’s first single, “Power,” blends a hard-edged King Crimson sample with an anthemic vocal melody taken from Continent Number 6’s “Afromerica.” West raps, “At the end of the day, goddamnit I’m killing this shit / I know damn well y’all feeling this shit,” and, no matter what you think of Kanye West, it’s hard to disagree.
It seems impossible to understand either West or his latest album without some understanding of his consistently embattled psyche. His sense of being constantly besieged by an undefined outside force was evident from the very first words spoken on his first solo single, “Through the Wire”—“They can’t stop me from rapping, can they?”—and this paranoia has never been more central to his music. On  “Gorgeous,” which matches a despairing, darkly melodic chorus from KiD CuDi with a driving, distorted electric guitar loop and Kanye’s fiercest lyrics yet, this feeling of constant struggle motivates the album’s standout punch line: “The same people that tried to blackball me / Forgot about two things: my black balls.”
Fans of “The College Dropout” and “Late Registration” may miss the easygoing, backpack-rap sensibility of “Family Business” or the carefree exuberance of “Touch the Sky.” Even “All of the Lights,” with its layered orchestration and all-star cast—Elton John plays piano beneath Alicia Keys’s buried vocals—can’t quite match the laid-back feel of these tracks. However, West introduces as many moods as he discards. He left off the album “Good Friday,” a celebratory piece recalling the mood of his earliest work, choosing to offer it for free download via his blog. With “So Appalled,” he taps into an unprecedented DJ Premier-tinged, heavily orchestrated sweep, and with “Blame Game” he reaches heights of tragic introspection barely suggested by his previous work.
In the careful cultivation of his album’s emotional palette West stands unmatched as a hip-hop auteur, alone in his ability to craft a rap album with a sweeping narrative arc that plots his own rapid rise and ensuing disorientation. His move from the triumph of “All of the Lights” to the admonition to “Run from the lights / Run for your life” of “Lost in the World” builds a narrative at once intensely personal and profoundly relatable. Its cohesion not only validates West’s creative vision but also suggests that the self-conscious, surprisingly grounded West of “The College Dropout” may be more repressed and disguised than altogether absent.
Since his move from super-producer to rap star, West has overseen major changes to mainstream hip-hop. He pioneered the use of soul samples with his production of Jay-Z’s “The Blueprint” and pushed Auto-Tune to the height of its popularity with his own “808s & Heartbreak.” But one thing hasn’t changed: behind the music is a man who will realize his goals by any means necessary, whether through lush production or grimy rapping, through mid-1990s production techniques or alternative rock instrumentation. Even now, a tumultuous decade into his career, Kanye West is a man who will see his fantasy made reality.

There are a lot of impoverished writers out there with an axe to grind against the big bad Internets. I’m sympathetic, I swear, but when the vendetta seeps into their books, it usually sounds kind of silly.
4. Netscape
Because shoehorning in references to obsolete browsers is the only way people will know your book is set in 2000.
Egregious example: “‘You’re in this crazy industry where people eat each other alive. No, wait’—she stopped Emily from interrupting—‘it’s in all the newspapers and the chat groups. Microsoft taking out Netscape. Veritech suing Janus.’‘You heard about that?’ Frankly, Emily was surprised to hear that Jess followed any news at all.” —Allegra Goodman, “The Cookbook Collector”
3. Screen names
In “Super Sad True Love Story,” Gary Shteyngart creates a creepy dystopia by tweaking and renaming contemporary technologies. But IM screen names are already pretty much obsolete—it’s like one of those seventies sci-fi movies where all the characters have car phones.
Egregious example: “JUNE 19.EUNI-TARD: Sally, are you bidding on the gray ankle boots at Padma? SALLYSTAR: How did you know?” —Gary Shteyngart, “Super Sad True Love Story”
2. Twitter
I’ll just let this example speak for itself.
Egregious example: “There was plenty of tweeting on Twitter, but the chirping and fluttering world of nature... was one anxiety too many.”—Jonathan Franzen, “Freedom”
1. The iPod
Creative capitalization always looks ridiculous, especially in a novel with highbrow pretensions. And seriously—if you want to show up some soul-sucking, attention-span-depleting, electronic factotum, the iPod is not your ideal target. Waiting for mine to provide directions using its sluggish WiFi connection is the most strenuous exercise in patience I’ve had since 2003.
Egregious example: “If he was listening to his iPod or playing a video game, or when he was able to connect, browsing online, it was—to her—as if he wasn’t there.” —Sigrid Nunez, “Salvation City”

“But I didn’t do anything!” wails the hapless Larry Gopnik, over and over, in an increasingly hysterical register, throughout the Coen brothers’ latest feature, “A Serious Man.” But it’s more than just a simple defensive gesture. The phrase itself becomes something of a character in the film, accruing meaning and ambiguity until, by the film’s end, it’s become a sort of prayer for the beleaguered hero. Larry (Michael Stuhlbarg), the possibly-titular protagonist, is a father, a scholar, a Jew, and perhaps most importantly, an innocent. His disclamation is his weapon, his epithet, and finally, a symbol for the film itself. Set in the late ’60s, in a Midwestern Jewish suburb, “A Serious Man” is an existential parable about the dissolution of Larry’s life, as he rapidly loses a grip on his marriage, faith, health, and personal integrity.
The film’s milieu is autobiographical in a way that Joel and Ethan Coen have avoided in their work up to this point. As auteurs (probably the most highly-regarded in America today, other than Martin Scorcese) the Coen Brothers are the consummate disguise-artist duo; they’ve managed to inject their own signature wit and worldview into the gamut of American genre film—the western, the noir, the screwball comedy, the epic—and, at their very best, those interpretations become studies of the genre itself. But “A Serious Man” feels remarkably close to home: set in a place not altogether foreign from the Coen family’s suburban Minnesota origin, in a moment in history when the directors themselves would have been adolescent boys.
What emerges from this apparently more personal approach are themes that have either been addressed more subtly or played as comic foil in the Coens’ previous work. Judaism, dealt with offhandedly in “Miller’s Crossing” and “The Big Lebowski,” moves to the forefront. The film itself is partitioned by Larry’s progressive consultation with his three community rabbis over the dissolution of his marriage, and the prologue is a sort of Yiddish folktale whose sinister climax hangs as a question over the body of the film. Larry is a modern Job: as his wife evicts him for another man (whose funeral he must eventually pay for), his hopes for tenure as a physics professor wane, and his money problems threaten to swallow him, he both endures his trials and, unlike Job, struggles to understand and interpret them with (though, decidedly, without) the help of spiritual advisors.
With Job as a frame of reference, of course, existentialism isn’t far behind. The Coens made their most intelligent stab at the matter with 1991’s “Barton Fink,” a film whose enigma gave life to its pervasive Sartrean tropes. But “A Serious Man” inflames this fascination unto the central antithesis to Larry’s faith: Larry’s first lecture in the film is on superposition—more precisely Schrodinger’s Cat—and later, in a dream, he discourses on the Uncertainty Principle: “This proves that nobody can know anything, but that doesn’t mean you won’t be responsible for it on the midterm!”
Broadly, the film is about a life that has become both conspicuous and unbearable; Larry is lost in the absurd distance between language and clarity, society and reason, existence and nausea. Anecdotally, no filmmakers could be better equipped for rendering this distance—the dialogue is rife with misunderstanding, miscommunication, misdirection and uncomfortable meditations on the body. But taken as whole—especially in light of an ending that feels more slight than clever—this thesis is never as interesting or amusing as its execution.
Storytelling becomes a way to understand both physics and faith: in a half-light that’s at least preferable to total darkness. But the film does well to illustrate how easy it is to miss the point entirely this way. Larry’s second rabbi tells him the story of an orthodontist who finds Hebrew characters chiseled into the back of a goy’s teeth that read “Help Me, Save Me.” The orthodontist’s search for the meaning of the words comes to no avail, and when Larry asks, “What happened to the goy?” the rabbi replies, “Is that relevant?” Larry is forced to confront a tradition as old as civilization which does little more than distract from, what for him, is a catastrophe proceeding in ignorance.
But even he might be missing the point. His jobless, cyst-ridden brother Arthur (Richard Kind), meanwhile, is crafting a probability map of the universe by way of esoteric pseudo-philosophy. Next door a beautiful, ganja-smoking, effectively single woman (Amy Landecker) seems his for the taking. Only his son, Danny (Aaron Wolff), manages to escape his father’s neurosis with the help of the sage-like Rabbi Marshak and Jefferson Airplane.
The film’s central flaw, if there is one to speak of, is the seriousness with which the Coens commit to all of these motifs. That’s not to say that this is a serious film—not in terms of tone, anyway—it strikes a tone as humorous as the funniest moments of the pair’s greatest films: “Barton Fink,” “Fargo,” and “The Big Lebowski.” But unlike any of those films, “A Serious Man” derives its substance from its ideas. Larry, and possibly his entire community, is ground down by the sheer weight of the realities of the human condition. We find his family and his associates fundamentally ridiculous, some even grotesque, and we find him pathetic—humorously so, but nevertheless. Larry never musters in the viewer so much as an iota of the sympathy or the fascination that Fink, Lebowski, or Marge Gunderson conjure so effortlessly. He is, in the end, merely an effigy; a Pilgrim sent on a journey into the metaphysical night.

Kanye’s latest album is a brash triumph, but just as important for 2010 was his acquisition of a Twitter account. West has quickly proven himself the year’s foremost up-to-the-minute commentator, filtering both the most common and the most exceptional of his experiences through his unparalleled blend of earnest bombast and self-conscious wit. As Kanye himself puts it, between the album and the ubiquitous media presence online, “You ain’t get the memo? Yeezy’s back in style.”
1. “I CAN HEAR YOU SCREAMING ‘COLOR INSIDE THE LINES!!!’ WELL FUCK YOUR COLORING BOOK.”
Because I’m not sure they sell coloring books in 2010. Is that an app?
2. “Yo I ain’t gone lie... the diamond teeth be looking crazy dope with tux jackets. The juxtaposition is what I live for.”
Because in 2010 we all lived for the juxtaposition.
3. “No seriously ... I said my teeth are real diamonds... these are not fronts... I replaced my bottom row of teeth with diamonds.”
Because that’s too real.
4. “On set of the movie... this doe just refuses to sit still... I told the deer... ‘what would Bambi do?’ & she looked at me like I was crazy.”
Because news of the overhyped VMAs incident must have reached the forest.
5. “Is it wrong to wear a CHANEL dinner jacket with a T shirt to the airport if it’s still breakfast time out here in Singapore uugh TOO LATE!”
Because if you’re still worrying about fixing something in 2010, it’s probably too late.
6. “Tell everyone at the label only use Gothic or Helvetic fonts for email blast unless I otherwise approve.”
Because no matter what Microsoft Word 2010 tells us, Cambria isn’t happening.
7. “Make sure your accounts receivable are faster than your accounts payable.”
Because 2010 was a year for financial awareness. Kanye’s one college dropout who knows when to step his accounts game up.
8. “I specifically ordered persian rugs with cherub imagery!!! What do I have to do to get a simple persian rug with cherub imagery uuuuugh.”
Because excess isn’t what it used to be.
9. “What’s better for devil worshipping Iphone or the Droid... Does lucifer return text... is he or she on Skype? Don’t wanna be sexist.”
Because 2010 was a year for worrying more about political correctness than eternal damnation.
10. “Everything sounds like noise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! EVERYTHING SOUNDS LIKE NOISE!!!!!!! I don’t trust anyone!”
Because this year left me confused, too.

Hogwarts and Harvard are the pinnacles of magical and Muggle education, so it’s not much of a surprise that there’s some overlap between the two. In all of our sprawling campus, these are the spots that seem most magical (not necessarily in a good way).
5. Annenberg
Doesn’t Annenberg look a lot like Platform Nine and Three Quarters? Just kidding. Everyone knows Annenberg and the Great Hall are actually the same place.
4. Steam Tunnels
The tunnels that run under the whole campus, all the way to the Business School, are perhaps even more impressive than the tunnels running from Hogwarts to Hogsmeade. And at Harvard you don’t even have to brave the Shrieking Shack in order to get out of them.
3. Cambridge Common
Ok, there aren’t very many trees (or man-eating spiders), but this is the closest we have to our very own Forbidden Forest. Watch out for the dangerous locals (centaurs, giants, muggers, etc.).
2. Memorial Hall Tower
If Harvard had a need for one, this would make a perfect Owlery. It’s already been taken over by birds, and it’s an ideal location for them to sweep through Annenberg delivering Howlers, broomsticks, and credit card spam.
1. Widener Lower Entrance
Does anyone else get a big Chamber of Secrets vibe in the corridor leading from the Mass. Ave. entrance to Widener? It’s semi-underground, the walls have a greenish tinge, and at the end there’s a statue of a bearded guy who looks like Salazar Slytherin. This place creeps me out.

I’ll admit, I wear my thick-rimmed glasses with pride; I cherish the sweaters I found tucked in the corner of Goodwill that some, probably far more rational person deemed too ugly and hideously 80s to be worn in public. When my father, perplexed by my most recent fashion choice asked me to describe what on earth I was wearing, I told him it was the latest in hipster fashion. My father then inquired what it meant to be a hipster. I stuttered, until I finally explained the term hipster was deceiving. In truth there are many subsets of the hipster culture. Here is my attempt to demystify a few found here in Cambridge:
1. The Intellectual Hipster
Most likely a philosophy or English concentrator.  Would be happy to debate Tolstoy v. Dostoyevsky. Finds mainstream music offensive. Dreams of being an expatriate or working at The New Yorker. Wears a uniform of skinny jeans, scarves and vintage glasses. BMI: 0. Can be found at Café Pamplona.
2. The Dirty Hipster
For the dirty hipster, man or woman, it’s no-shave November year round.  Date of last bath: unknown. Usually vegan, enjoys long hikes and getting in touch with nature. Inexplicably wears plaid flannel shirts in the summer.
3. The Urban Outfitters Hipster
Only shops at Urban Outfitters because they “stole” their style. Might have a trust-fund. Can be found at Café Pamplona.
4. The Death to the Man Hipster
Anti-establishment—actually anti-everything. Probably a member of the communist party. Do not under any circumstances ask them about their viewpoints unless you have time for an hour-long diatribe that will probably conclude with how Starbucks is ruining the world.  Thinks they are better than you because they only shop local and organic. Can be found at Café Pamplona.
5. The Emo Hipster
The emo hipster is more of a transitional phase. Most often they are high school students. Speaks loudly of their love for Bright Eyes and MGMT, so everyone can admire their musical knowledge. Can be found in The Garage (soon to graduate to Café Pamplona).

I have never seen any of the “Bring It On” movies. I was too busy watching “You Got Served,” “Drumline,” “Step Up 3D,” “Stomp The Yard 2: Homecoming,” “Save the Last Dance,” and “Breakin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo.”
5. “Bring It On Again” (2003)
Okay, I could not even follow the Wikipedia summary for this one. There is apparently a lot of backstabbing. But, in the end, the main character wins the cheer competition. I think. There’s something about gathering up outcasts and forming a ragtag squad of misfits. I’m not even sure. This is clearly the worst installment.
4. “Bring It On: Fight To The Finish” (2009)
Christina Milian plays Lina, a cheerleader from LA who transfers to a prep school after her gold-digging mom marries a rich guy. She has a crush on a basketball player, Evan, but then she breaks up with him. But then they get back together in the end? Lina recruits her other friends from L.A., Gloria and Treyvonetta, to join her squad. At some point, the cheer team goes to something called a “flavour school” to work on their moves. Also, their mascot is the most intimidating of animals, the Sea Lion. Lina wins the cheer competition. This seems like a fun movie.
3. “Bring It On: In It To Win It” (2007)
It’s a showdown at Camp Spirit-Thunder, where the Sharks face off against their rivals, the Jets, in an obvious “‘West Side Story”’ allusion. The Sharks gain possession of the Spirit Stick, but someone steals it. Anyway, after the Spirit Stick disappears, the Sharks hold some odd cultish ceremony to appeal to the “Cheer Gods.” The Sharks are then interrupted when the Jets show up for a “cheer-rumble.” The Sharks and Jets reluctantly combine teams to become the “Shets” and beat a rival camp in a cheer competition. This one is ranked third only because the name “Shets” makes it so easy to rip on this movie.
2. “Bring It On” (2000)
There are a lot of copied routines, and some weird racial tension in this one. Unfortunately, I have to dock some points because Kirsten Dunst is awful. In addition, reading the summary of this one reminded me of the band B*Witched and their cover of “Mickey.” Remember when Jesse Bradford was an actor who actually had some clout? I don’t. Also, did you know that “Bring It On”’ was known as “Cheers!” in Japan?
1. “Bring It On: All Or Nothing” (2006)
Britney is relocated to a more impoverished neighborhood, Crenshaw Heights, and has to battle her former squad mate from Pacific Vista High. This installment coins numerous influential terms, such as “cheerwhore.” The teams compete for a chance to appear in Rihanna’s music video. Crenshaw Heights manages to beat Pacific Vista in the cheer competition with their secret weapon: krumping. The victorious squad gets to appear in Rihanna’s video for “Pon De Replay” and wins brand new computers for their entire school. But really, aren’t we all winners?

The depiction of a brilliantly attempted liberation of alleged murderer Lara Brennan (Elizabeth Banks) by her husband John (Russell Crowe) cleverly distracts from what would be a creeping sense of sheer implausibility and a mounting number of favorable coincidences that conspire to bog down “The Next Three Days.” Perhaps most recognized as the award-winning director of “Crash,” Paul Haggis is able to tie together intricate details and desperate emotions in a surprisingly believable and fascinating manner in his latest film.
With all the evidence supporting the accusation that Lara killed her boss one night in a parking garage, her intensely loyal husband John appeals her life sentence to no avail. As her very young son grows distant, Lara’s spirit deteriorates in jail to the point of attempting suicide, but John assures her, “This will not be your life.” He soon decides to mastermind an elaborate scheme to rescue her from her misery.
After meeting with a successful prison escapee (as portrayed by Liam Neeson), John acquires the wherewithal for his rescue plan and becomes obsessively committed to it. Abandoning his job as a college professor as well as his family, he becomes engrossed in efforts to learn every intricacy of Lara’s prison. He trades all his items of worth to supply the expensive costs of the escape, works with underground criminals to acquire necessities­—like fake identification—and to find any flaws in the system that he can take advantage of in his plan. When John is notified that Lara is about to be moved to another prison, his plan becomes direly urgent—he is forced to finally execute the prison break which he has obsessed over for months.
The ability of Russell Crowe and Elizabeth Banks to convey the desperation, frustration, and mutual devotion of their respective characters contributes significantly to making Haggis’s vision for this film a reality. Perhaps the most twisted and beautiful moment in the movie is when Lara—deeply distressed in the aftermath of her failed appeal—exclaims that John never once asked her if she actually killed the woman. In fact, she shockingly tells him that if he thought she was innocent, “then [he’d] be wrong.” Yet, Crowe portrays convictions so strong that it seems natural that this potentially revealing fact does not discourage John from seeking freedom for Lara and their family.
Watching John execute each step of his plan is indeed suspenseful, but it seems that more effort was put into showing his extensive planning rather than creating a believable escape plot. For instance, when the couple has escaped in a car and is faced with the possibility of needing to leave their son behind, Lara opens her passenger door and attempts to fall out of the speeding vehicle; the cinematography of this moment, however, is so poor that this dramatic action comes off as borderline cartoonish. The Pittsburg Police Department also seems unrealistically ineffective, serving as a convenient facilitator of many implausible plot points.
The driving force of “The Next Three Days” is the ambiguity of Lara’s innocence. Though she seems to admit to the crime at one point, the audience is unsure if this is just a lie she has come to believe as a result of her deep sorrow. To complicate matters, a counterplot in which another person kills Lara’s boss and happens to run into her, leaving the unmistakable bloodstain on her jacket, is also shown as part of the film. “The Next Three Days” draws its beauty from John’s pledge of his life to saving Lara despite this uncertainty. As John says to his class in a lecture about Don Quixote, “Rational thought destroys the soul.” Though too much rational thinking may expose the gaps in the logic of this film, its soul is firmly rooted in its believable, relatable, and thoroughly real emotions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students waiting outside Berryline for their favorite frozen dessert are in for an entirely different kind of treat these days—the sight of seventies-clad revelers waiting in line to see “The Donkey Show,” the premiere of Diane M. Paulus’ ’87 inaugural season as artistic director of the American Repertory Theater (A.R.T.). Recently extended to January 2, 2010, “The Donkey Show” is the first production in the newly-renovated theatrical club space OBERON.
Previously known as the Zero Arrow Theater, the venue was rebranded as a complement to Paulus’ notoriously non-traditional approach to theater. “I’m interested in bashing apart any limitations of what theater should be,” Paulus said in a previous interview with The Crimson. With its disco lights, fully stocked bars and liberal cell phone policy, OBERON’s transformation from the black box Zero Arrow to its current state as a nightclub-theater fusion has stimulated the largely dormant theater scene at Harvard. With time, the A.R.T. hopes that the experiments conducted at OBERON will have a greater influence on cultural production, changing the course of theater and re-casting the A.R.T. as a lead actor on the national stage.
BREAK (A LEG)!
The A.R.T. opened the Zero Arrow Theater with goals similar to those motivating the creation of OBERON, albeit without the disco lights and Studio 54 vibe. As the A.R.T.’s satellite theatrical space, Zero Arrow produced experimental fare in an adaptable and intimate space. “Zero Arrow was originally developed to be an incubator for new work, with different theatrical offerings on any given night,” OBERON program associate Daniel R. Pecci ’09 says. “It was a flexible space and the seating was supposed to change. You would see one show and then the next night, see another.”
As recently as 2004, then-artistic director Robert Woodruff assured the theatrical community of Zero Arrow’s renewed commitment to experimentation. Uncannily citing an experimental production of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” as inspiration, Woodruff envisioned a space that would be “friendly and hospitable” during the day and theatrical at night. To that end, it remained a performance venue, but humanitarian groups were invited to use Zero Arrow during work hours.
“This new space is going to become a landmark space in the American theater where new forms get born,” said Gideon Lester, the A.R.T.’s then-associate artistic director.
Yet such optimistic hopes proved futile. In recent years, Zero Arrow lost sight of its roots, falling into a pattern where a show would run for a set period of time and then close, leaving the space empty until the next show loaded in, and the social activists have since re-located. “It froze and basically became a traditional regional theater, but smaller,” Pecci says.
While remaining devoted to Zero Arrow’s initial intentions of innovation, OBERON is taking a different approach—engaging directly with audiences, starting with students.
PLAYING WITH POSSIBILITIES
OBERON’s transformation into a pseudo-club is one way of enticing the Harvard crowd, offering a novel, interactive theatrical experience superior to any dorm-room party. “People are expecting to sit down in seats and follow the story of ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’ like you would anywhere else,” Pecci says, referring to “The Donkey Show.” “And they pregame and think they need drinks, and I’m like, ‘No, no, you can drink in here.’”
To effectively redefine the notion of “seeing a play,” the A.R.T. not only needs innovative productions, but also a new kind of performance space. For “The Donkey Show”—the groundbreaking hybrid of disco and “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”—this meant a place where people could dance.
Randy Weiner ’87-’88, Paulus’ husband and collaborator, was initially hesitant when she approached him about bringing “The Donkey Show,” with its particular environmental requirements, to Cambridge. “My show needed a club level sound system, club level lights, and a fully stocked bar,” he says. “The place needed to really have a nightclub’s energy and edge.” Weiner—now the creator and producer of OBERON—used his experience developing his own New York City club theater, The Box, to transform Zero Arrow into a full nightclub environment.
Working with set designer Scott Pask and lighting designer Evan Morris, Weiner revamped Zero Arrow into a hotspot of non-traditional theater. Starting with the Zero Arrow’s frame of a black box, the team installed the set of a nightclub. New set pieces for the space include cocktail tables, a mirrored wall, fully-stocked bars, a DJ booth, a lit “OBERON” sign, and a dance floor. In the spirit of audience engagement, the A.R.T. held a public vote to name the club in late July, finally settling upon OBERON. Adding to the appeal of this alternative theater for the younger crowd, OBERON encourages the use of cell phones and cameras during the performance. The bars stay open throughout the show, and the venue turns into a full-blown nightclub after the final bow.
“It’s always exciting to play with the possibilities of what theater is,” Weiner says. “There’s a whole world of theater that can happen as what people consider to be a nightclub. Clubs are theater, but they’re theater that’s 360 degrees around you and goes in time from the moment you wait in line outside to the moment you leave. It’s complete freedom, with a rock and roll kind of energy. It allows the audience to engage with each other.”
“The Donkey Show” at OBERON was opened in the hope of ushering in a new era of theater—and nightlife—in Cambridge. “OBERON is fascinating because there are so many people in Boston who want to go to a disco,” James B. Danner ’12 says. “And it’s a piece of real estate where there’s a damn good DJ and a really entertaining and sexy show, and you feel utterly transported. In an environment where people think way too much, OBERON gets them to go to a disco and have fun, and hopefully understand that that is a show. That’s the magic of it. I’ve seen ‘The Donkey Show’ four times already.”
Despite its unique decor, OBERON remains as flexible a venue as when it was Zero Arrow. Much of the disco feel is created by sound and lights, which can be changed depending on the needs of the current production. While many non-profit theaters across America have adaptable black box second stages, OBERON and its club set are, according to Weiner, “the second stage of the future.”
In addition to “The Donkey Show,” OBERON has plans to host myriad non-traditional theatrical events including Boiling Point Burlesque, horror cabaret show “47 Ways to Die,” The Steamy Bohemians’ “Jerkus Circus,” and circus band act Emperor Norton’s Stationary Marching Band. It also recently presented a naked comedy showcase and “Waterboard: a play about torture,” followed by Muslim punk band The Kominas.
“The idea of OBERON is to, as long as it feels vital, have it in a club configuration and club set and find shows that make sense in that set-up,” Weiner says. “We want to have artists come and get inspired by the power of it. The audience can be free and drink and dance and have a communal experience different than what they’re used to. It has a long future.”
INCUBATOR OF NEW WORK
Though the recent makeover of Zero Arrow brings it back to its initial purpose of hosting innovative work, OBERON is also determined to revitalize the theater scene, becoming a central part of the recently impassioned dialogue about the arts at Harvard.
There is no fixed plan for what will take place and Weiner hopes that he has created a venue where people can simply try things. “What’s nice about OBERON is that it’s achieving a lot of what Zero Arrow was initially trying to do,” Pecci says. “The fact that this space exists in the first place is a testament to seeing change in the arts at Harvard.”
“It’s gotten people talking about the arts,” Isabel Q. Carey ’12 says. “I can’t remember the last time I heard so many people talk about a show at one time. I have friends who want to see ‘The Donkey Show’ that I had to drag to shows before.”
OBERON’s experimental and audience-engaging philosophy stems from Weiner’s personal belief in cultivating fresh ideas—especially of the non-traditional sort. “By creating this venue, we’re creating an opportunity for people to make shows for this type of venue,” Weiner says. “Opportunities create artists. There are people doing strange performances all over Boston but they don’t have a venue to express it. When they have a venue, they’re going to do it better and inspire audiences.”
Weiner’s desire to encourage original art and connect with students led to the creation of Dramatic Arts 113: “The History and Practice of Non-Traditional Theater in America.” He teaches the course in OBERON, with Pecci as his teaching fellow. Weiner hopes to engage the Harvard student body in an active dialogue about innovation in theater and art. “I’m interested in creating an environment where creative things can percolate up and be discovered,” Weiner says. “This class is my dream, to be inspiring these kids to try different things, because in a selfish way, I like to see new, exciting things. One of the joys of going to theater is to see something new.”
The A.R.T.’s “experience theater” approach extends to this class, which asks students to immerse themselves in non-traditional theater of all forms: professional wrestling, haunted houses, circuses, torture porn, and vaudeville. “It’s very heavily involved with the type of theater they’re doing now at the A.R.T.,” says Megan L. Amram ’10, a student in the class.
“We’re getting at the root of what unconventional theater is and exploring and exposing that discourse and its practical applications in the artistic context, like OBERON itself does,” Danner, another class member, says.
The performers and creators of “The Donkey Show” are also teaching the class how to run the production. By the end of the semester, students will “ride the donkey,” or act in “The Donkey Show” themselves, in order to experience performing in a club atmosphere.
Dramatic Arts 113 provides an out-of-the-classroom experience unmatched by other dramatic arts classes. “Being taught in OBERON is fun because it immediately takes you out of the context of school,” Danner says. “It feels like you’re learning, but not in the way you would in a classroom. Your mind is fundamentally changed when you walk into a club. And that’s a point OBERON makes, taking something out of its context and putting it into a different space.”
Though currently focused on promoting its first production and finding its footing as a site of non-traditional theater, the team behind OBERON hopes to eventually nurture fresh talent and actively get students involved in theater outside of Dramatic Arts 113.
“Harvard has the smartest people in the world,” Weiner says. “By rationally discussing this type of performance and getting as analytical as possible about what makes non-traditional theater, Harvard students have an incredible chance to do new things in theater. I want to help inspire them. It can have a great ripple effect.”
The A.R.T. hopes to eventually see its influence extending beyond the Harvard community, with companies around the country becoming more dedicated to non-traditional theater.  “OBERON connects with Diane Paulus’ vision,” Pecci says. “Her vision is for artists all over the country to be engaging with audiences in new and different ways, to expand the boundaries of theater.”
NOT YOUR CUP OF G & “TEA”
While OBERON has made innovative theater and audience engagement its top priority, hoping to increase its cultural impact, not everyone appreciates this type of experience. “Different people have different preferences,” Elizabeth “Lisa” Schechner ’11 says. “I think I would probably prefer traditional theater.”
Despite the throngs of enthusiastically dancing audience members who frequent “The Donkey Show,” there are also some who choose to hang back and watch from a distance, clearly yearning for a chair in a regular auditorium. OBERON accounts for these individuals by offering non-dance floor seats at the cocktail tables.
Weiner recognizes that OBERON might not fit everyone’s idea of theater, but mass appeal is not the point. “Every show has an audience,” Weiner says. “We do these strange shows. Is it everyone’s cup of tea? No.”
“OBERON promotes a wonderful freedom,” Weiner continues. “In traditional theater, they make you sit and watch the whole show. I never feel boredom like I do in traditional theater. In all that long show, maybe there are 10 minutes that are boring and I wish I could go chill out and have a drink. OBERON allows for that. This isn’t the only way to do theater but it’s another way, an alternative.”
Regardless of whether this form of theater is immediately accepted, Weiner hopes that audiences will at least give it a chance.  “‘The Donkey Show’ is a flagship of what can happen here,” he says. “What’s so cool is I’m not sure where it’s all going to lead. I just want to provide a venue where people can try things. Come to the show, test it, and try it.”
The value of such a dynamic addition to Harvard nightlife is not lost on students. “A club opened up across from Berryline. And it’s a fantasy-land club with glitter and Mylar and blasting 70s music and lights and sex splashed all over it,” Danner says. “We’re in college; what more could we ask for?”

5. “Young Wizards”
Forget J.K. Rowling. Diane Duane’s “So You Want to Be a Wizard” was published more than a decade before Harry Potter hit the wizarding scene. Nita and Kit battle the “Lone Power,” a fearful symbol of destruction and entropy, who turns out just to be really lonely.
Never gets old: the spells cast by these wizards are grounded in biological and physical concepts, which makes magic seem that much more plausible. And that makes the child in me rejoice.
4. “Redwall”
Maybe these did become formulaic after a while, but something about anthropomorphized animals waging war on each other inevitably reduced me to sobbing over dead fictional woodland creatures at the tragic end of every book. Never mind the fact that the heroes are all cuddly mice and hares and badgers while the villains are illiterate and ungrammatical rats and weasels, indicating some ill-conceived idea about species homogeneity. Damn the vermin.
Never gets old: Brian Jacques’s lengthy descriptions of mint and dandelion tea, scones and turnovers, and elderberry wine.
3. “Ender”
Sure, this series involves themes of moral obligation, racial tolerance, governmental control, and the implications of “Lord of the Flies”-esque violence. But what is better are the zero-gravity conflicts of the Battle Room. And the Giant’s Drink! And “Xenocide” (xkcd, you got it wrong).
Never gets old: Ender > Bean.
2. “His Dark Materials”
Philip Pullman’s complex trilogy culminates in (SPOILER ALERT) the death of God, whereby a heavenly war is concluded, and humanity is saved. Along the way, there are fantastic battles, unassuming items with magical powers, and daemons—animal manifestations of a person’s personality that can shift form before permanently settling into a shape after adolescence. All I ever wanted was a pet.
Never gets old: I still think of Lyra’s mother every time I see or hear of Ann Coulter. As Pullman made no secret of his agenda (anti-religious puts it lightly), he probably wouldn’t mind this association so much.
1. “Animorphs”
On the surface, this series is about a group of teenagers who have the ability to morph into animals and use that power to save the universe from parasitic aliens. But 64 books in, “Animorphs” is so much more than just about becoming a grizzly bear for a while. This series is a badass bildungsroman, with due attention paid to the evolution of its characters as they confront the wearying trials of war.
Never gets old: “The Hork-Bajir Chronicles.” Incredibly, incredibly epic. Oh, and the flipbooks.
—Denise J. Xu is finally an outgoing Campus Arts editor. As a child, she really liked the idea of alternate universes that sometimes included animals. Some things never change.

5. Harvard Guerrilla Art Initiative
This group would bring some much-needed creativity and self-expression back to Harvard’s bathroom stalls. It could perhaps be founded by someone in Adams.
4. John Cage Orchestra
Mozart and Bach get their own musical groups on campus, so why not this twentieth century visionary? Primary club responsibilities including staging an annual performance of 4’33’’. No auditions (or even basic musical experience) necessary!
3. Harvard Bagpipers Association
Think how much less boring Convocation and Commencement would be if there were tartan-clad students entertaining us with sweet Highland aires.
2. Harvard Dadaist Society
For those of you who have ever thought to yourselves: “If I put this HUDS tray in the Sackler, is it art?”, this is the club for you.
1. Harvard Topiary Society
Imagine if budget cuts forced the Office for the Arts and the Office of Sustainability to merge; we could have giant, creatively-trimmed shrubbery in the shape of Drew Faust! Think of the possibilities!

As the last leaves fall from the trees lining Plympton Street, here at the Crimson we are starting to look back over our year. Yet even as we bask in the warm glow of our innumerable victories, we must also recall our rare moments of indulgence. As we charged courageously into unchartered tabloid territories; as we fought the rising beast of competitors’ committee reviews; as we rallied troops to circulate in the darkest of hours, we also made some objectively obnoxious puns. Here are the ten most groan-worthy specimens from the past twelve months.
10. “‘Solar’ Powered by Accidents” — Books, February 23
This one should be pretty self-explanatory. Then again, perhaps not; one commenter found a rather different message in the piece. “Such a nice article and it is too informative for all blogger because ‘Solar Power’ is too useful for people but why not people use this?” a certain “Catherine Russell” wrote.
9. “Jury Rules Against ‘Conviction’” — Movies, October 19
For a review of a film about the Innocence Project, this one was far too easy. What’s more, let’s admit it—the day an accused faces a jury composed entirely of Crimson Arts board members is the day the federal justice system collapses.
8. “BSO Plays Third and Fourth, Comes Out First” — Campus Arts, February 23
The Bach Society Orchestra—or was it the Boston Symphony Orchestra?—played things by Beethoven that are numbered. And apparently they were then graced with a First Something or Other by the Crimson Arts board.
7. “Proletariart” — Cover, April 6
It’s mildly unacceptable that I got away with slapping a pseudo-word on a broadsheet cover story. Jeff and Ryan must not have been looking.
6. “‘Hornet’s Nest’ Is Best Left Undisturbed” — Movies, November 2
I actually don’t have anything negative to say about this one. It’s pretty good. Carry on, then!
5. “Not Much to Feel with ‘Hands All Over’” — Music, September 28
Apparently Maroon 5’s latest album was not too ‘hot’. Some might say it wasn’t their most ‘satisfying’ work. I heard it ‘leaves something to be desired’. Basically, it ‘sucks’—or does it?
4. “‘Four Lions’ Mines Humor from Terrorism” — Movies, November 9
A little subtler, yes, but all the more offensive once it dawns on you.
3. “‘Unstoppable’ Overcomes Train Wreck of a Premise” — Movies, November 16
To be fair, it would be more embarrassing if we hadn’t managed to come up with a pun for a movie of this title.
2. “Organ Gives Life To Choral Sound” — Campus Arts, November 16
Pretty sure the neurobiologist headlined this one.
1. “Korean Filmmaker Bong is a Hit at HFA” — Campus Arts, March 9
In response to this stroke of genius, one “Aronymous” commenter graciously commended our commitment to “the utmost in maturity and ethnic sensitivity.”
Keep up the good work, Arts!
—Outgoing Covers Executive and incoming Arts Chair Antonia M.R. Peacocke enjoys navel-gazing of a Sunday. To be fair, she only really headlined one piece per week, and even then she had lots of help.

Hailing from an extended family of classical musicians, I had a slightly uncharacteristic childhood. Though my parents were mostly ignorant of Elvis, the Rolling Stones, and James Brown—not to mention the great names of the decade of disco—they did make sure their kids were well versed in ye olde crusty classical composers.
A favorite of Mom and Dad’s was tuning into the local classical radio station to play “NAME THAT COMPOSER!” After years of stumbling through their drills, I have developed an ear for these composers’ music—and their unintuitive foreign surnames. Now you can learn from my mistakes and impress Grandma and Grandpa at the next Tanglewood outing with these pneumonic tips.
5. Frédéric Chopin
‘Chopin’ rhymes with ‘sho’ can’. See, this is easy already.
4. Claude Debussy
The French have made this one tricky. Foolproof tip: imagine lounging in Paris avec un béret et un café au lait. Scrunch the lips, raise the eyebrows, turn down the sides of mouth, and say “DE-byoo-see.” Try to look mildly scornful at the same time.
3. Johann Pachelbel
A very hard one. The ‘ch’ is aspirated, as in ‘loch,’ but a lot stronger. It helps to have some phlegm in your gullet. If you can’t do that, approximate by rhyming ‘Pachelbel’ with ‘Taco Bell’. Whatever you do, try not to spit. (Sorry Johann, you may have rolled over a few times in your grave over that one.)
2. Hector Berlioz
‘Barley oats’? ‘Burly Oz’? Actually, it’s more like ‘barely-Os’. Good thing Hector didn’t go into the Cheerios business.
1.5. Marcel Bitsch
Do not attempt.
1.0. Georg Friedrich Fuchs
Definitely do not attempt. The same goes for Johann Joseph Fux. Well, only if you’re on a first name basis.
—Alyssa A. Botelho is an incoming Campus Arts Editor. Her favorite composer is Brahms, which isn’t awkward to say at all.

If a culture reflects its subjects, it’s more than appropriate that culture in 2010 was more miasma than movement. From Twitter-jockeying to the 24-hour news cycle, it’s become more apparent with each passing year that the ideological charade of cultural reinvention has slowed in novelty and ambition to a stultifying, zombified lurch. Or so we all learned in that one grad seminar. Here are five undeniable signs that culture in 2010 is beyond resuscitation.
5. The Rally to Restore Sanity And/Or Fear
No two people in America have been as consistently funny about such consistently un-funny circumstances as Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert. Somewhere in the spectrum between court jesters and philosophical interlocutors, their blend of political entertainment and entertaining politics made explicit the unhappiness of the current marriage of rhetoric and spectacle on Capitol Hill and elsewhere. But at some point the decision was made to put an earnest foot forward into the political fray, and on the terms of Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin no less. The result was a confusingly pallid, expectedly self-congratulatory gesture, short on laughter and ideas in equal measure.
4. Hipster Runoff
Like greatest hits compilations and violent political upheaval, metacriticism has its place and its time—at year’s end, for instance. All the better that most people don’t have the wherewithal or the free time to expend trawling the Internet for emerging memes, microtrends, and the staggering permutations of Americans’ collective search for authenticity, let alone to catalog and mock them all. Blogger Carles is the exception. Hipster Runoff, his brainchild, is exactly what it sounds like: a virtual dumping-ground for anecdotes in the life of the cultural scavenger known as the hipster, bolstered by faux-schizophrenic web-slang introspection in bold, ironic colors. The stomach-turning part is that it’s actually on point now and then.
3. Four Loko
The liquid lovechild of moonshine, cough syrup, Red Bull, and Hi-C, Four Loko stormed the 18-to-24 demographic this year with the vehemence of the Blitzkrieg in Poland. Across the country, one in five of your friends ‘had an insane night last night’ with the help of a potable, mildly unpleasant friend in a $3.00 tall boy. Unfortunately, the absinthe of the YouTube generation doesn’t induce poetic vision. Side effects include slurred speech, raunchy dancing, and regret.
2. Four Loko Banned, Diluted
Ironically, the referendum on big government in this year’s midterm elections transpired concurrently with statewide bans on our blackout-ambrosia across the country, in a move that resonates weirdly with the Temperance era. Subsequently, the drink’s manufacturers—in all likelihood two dudes named Mitch or Javier with pet snakes and unkempt beards—announced that they would remove the beverage’s caffeine, taurine, and guarana, which, for some consumers, amounts to the Beatles without John, Paul, or George.
1. Tree of Codes
By the time you read this, culture may already be dead. “Tree of Codes,” Jonathan Safran Foer’s third ‘novel’ is advertised as a work of sculptural literature. What this actually involves, however, appears to be passages cribbed from Foer’s favorite work of fiction, Bruno Schultz’s “The Street of Crocodiles,” cut up and arranged on various pages, which themselves have lines haphazardly cut out of them. The desired result is a book that ‘looks really interesting’. The actual result is the invitably navel-gazing resolution of one of the more embarrassing creative arcs in contemporary literature. Whether anyone will buy the thing, let alone have the patience to read it, only determines how spectacularly Foer will have managed to avoid embarrassing himself among his own waning literary cult and the dubious conceptual art community to which he’s pandering. Or not.
—Ryan J. Meehan is the outgoing Arts Chair. He is not ‘outgoing’ in that sense.

Like most years, 2010 was a big year for The Boss. Let’s look back at some of the finer moments.
5. Springsteen declines invitation to play at Chris Christie’s gubernatorial inauguration
A surprising move by The Boss, having just recently written “Wrecking Ball” as a tribute to the N.J. politician’s stature and career.
4. “The Wrestler” director Darren Aronofsky recounts calling out The Boss
“What the hell’s a one legged-dog walking down the street?” Aronofsky asked. “Art often comes out of the mistakes and that’s when the poetry comes alive and you have to welcome them,” Bruce replied, as he set down his beer on a copy of “Lucky Town.”
3. Bruce and Jimmy Fallon play Willow Smith’s “Whip Your Hair”
A longtime admirer of the trailblazing singer-songwriter, Springsteen has a long history of collaboration with Smith dating back to 1978’s “Because the Night.”
2. Brian Williams interviews Bruce about the “Darkness on the Edge of Town” reissue
Taking a break from taping “30 Rock” cameos, Williams asked probing questions like “How great is New Jersey?” and “We are awesome.”
1. Pavement’s Stephen Malkmus introduces special guest Bruce Springsteen at a New York concert
It wasn’t really him, but I like to think that for a brief moment Bruce could hear the cries from across the Hudson and vowed one day, in this world or the next, to mend our broken hearts with a soulful cover of “Debris Slide.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amidst the demons of “Saw 3D” and “Resident Evil: Afterlife” that have been stalking the big screen lately, another fiend recently arose from quite the unexpected source: “Toy Story 3.” Big Baby, that movie’s baby-doll thug, supplies a nightmare-inducing presence that still leads me to shudder any time I see a toy of similar appearance. The drooping eyelid, the teardrop tattoo, the chilling silence—Big Baby might be a Pixar creation, but he’s more creepy brute than cheerful plaything. Inspired by this terrifying turn in a supposed children’s movie, here are my top five bloodcurdling moments that come from more unconventional sources than your standard horror films.
 5. Talky Tina in “The Twilight Zone”
“The Twilight Zone” might be consistently creepy, but it very rarely delves into the truly frightening. Not so in “Living Doll,” the classic 1963 episode in which a cranky stepfather protests the present of a new doll for his stepdaughter by trying to get rid of the toy. Bad move. The doll, Talky Tina, morphs into a stealthy slayer, telling the stepfather, “My name is Talky Tina, and I’m going to kill you.” After a series of unsuccessful attempts by the stepfather to destroy Tina, the doll causes her enemy to trip down the stairs and die. Chucky—the doll that gains a serial killer’s soul in 1988’s “Child’s Play”—might be the standard in murderous toys, but Tina deserves equal credit for her chilling inscrutability.
 4. The pale man in “Pan’s Labyrinth”
While “Pan’s Labyrinth” is ostensibly a dark fairy tale, the gangly, eyes-in-hands Pale Man elevates the film to pure horror—especially for the poor fairy whose head serves as a gruesome snack for the monster.
 3. The dollhouse in “Are You Afraid of the Dark?”
The Midnight Society’s fireside tales in “Are You Afraid of the Dark?” rarely led any pre-teen to issue even the slightest shiver of fear. However, 1994’s “The Tale of the Doll Maker” proved uncannily horrifying and scarring as young Susan’s skin turns to porcelain and her arm falls out when she gets trapped in a creepy attic dollhouse. Submitted for the approval of the Midnight Society, I maintain that this episode terrorized me as a child—and maybe even a little to this day.
2. Trinity’s second kill in “Dexter”
Modern crime serials frequently encounter the problem of crafting unique and interesting deaths for their victims each week. “Dexter”—which tends to focus on the disconcerting rather than horrifying—has yet to be plagued by this difficulty, as vividly evidenced by the Trinity Killer’s homicide in the terrifically terrifying fourth season episode “Blinded by the Light.” Trinity killing a young mother to continue his murder cycle is unsettling; forcing her to jump off a building of her own will is downright petrifying.
 1. The boat ride in “Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory”
Gene Wilder serenely reciting such lines as “Not a speck of light is showing so the danger must be growing. Are the fires of hell a-glowing? Is the grisly reaper mowing?” while he leads a psychedelic boat ride through a tunnel along the chocolate river—complete with repulsive images projected on the seemingly spinning walls? Seems less like a lighthearted children’s movie than a bad—and absolutely nightmarish—trip.
—Ali R. Leskowitz is an outgoing Campus Arts editor. She really doesn’t like dolls.

5. “Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance”
Thought Park-Chan Wook’s bloody, brilliant “Vengeance Trilogy” had escaped Hollywood bastardization? Think again. Though Will Smith and Steven Spielberg’s mooted “Oldboy” remake is (thankfully) still dead, an English language script for the next-best film in the trilogy is currently making the rounds.
4. “The NeverEnding Story”
This movie will be infinitely worse if it: 1. has good CGI, and 2. isn’t unintentionally creepy/scarring for the small children who are its only audience. Both of which, sadly, seem likely to happen in the remake.
3. “Robocop”
Wait a second... directed by Darren Aronofsky? Written by David Self? I take it all back: “Requiem for a Dream” crossed with “Road to Perdition” plus crime-fighting robots sounds incredible.
2. “Straw Dogs”
“OK, you’ve had your fun,” growls Dustin Hoffman in Sam Peckinpah’s original. “I’ll give you one more chance, and if you don’t clear out now, there’ll be real trouble. I mean it.” Now imagine those lines now coming out of the mouth of ...James Marsden, a guy whose recent roles include Prince Edward in “Enchanted” and the groom in the Katherine Heigl vehicle “27 Dresses.”
 1. “The Warriors”
Why, Hollywood? Why? Or not.
—Daniel K. Lakhdhir is an incoming Campus Arts editor. He is classic.

In 1958, a young, soon-to-be Boston University dropout named Joan Baez played her first live show. It was at a venue called Club 47 just outside of Harvard Square, and only eight people were in attendance.  From this inauspicious beginning Baez soon rose to be the queen of the folk genre, and with the likes of Bob Dylan and Pete Seeger changed the world with her music.
It is this history, among others in the folk tradition, that is being celebrated by the New England Folk Music Archives, an institution that was founded two years ago. It is dedicated to bringing the rich style of folk music back into the public eye. In November, the group installed a temporary gallery at 30 Brattle Street with a collection of photographs and books and placed a small collection of photographs in J.P. Licks on Massachusetts Avenue.
“Our job is to present and promote the history of folk music,” says George Pratt, a volunteer at the Archives. The location of the Archives, just blocks away from the original Club 47, is no coincidence. “A lot of this came out of Club 47, which in the 1950s and 1960s was the center of the folk revival,” Pratt says.
The Archives catalogs Cambridge’s rich musical history with pictures of musicians like Bruce Springsteen, who was rather ironically refused a gig at Club 47’s successor Club Passim.
Betsy Siggins, the founder of the New England Folk Music Archives, was a key member of the Club 47 scene back in the 60s and counted several famous folk musicians among her friends. “I do this because it is a natural progression for me… to try to consolidate this history into a cohesive body of work,” she says.
However, the Archives is not only a gallery. As of this December, the institution will be moving into a new space in the Somerville Armory. Along with a smaller gallery, the Archives will be running a music school as well as a conference space.
The New England Folk Music Archives has also formed a relationship with the Haggerty School, a public school in west Cambridge. The Archives work with modern musicians to teach the history of folk music to local children.
“We had Alastair Moock who did a piece on the history surrounding Woody Guthrie,” says Karen Kosko, the librarian at the Haggerty School. “We also were able to give each of the 63 kids a harmonica, and gave them the opportunity to make their own music.”
The school plans to continue working with the Archives this year on a similar project based around the children’s family life in order to help them—many of whom are from immigrant communities—to draw connections between their experiences and the experiences of other Americans.
For Kosko, folk music is a great tool to help forge this connection. “I feel that there is this whole layer of folk music that is a story,” she says. “Many of my kids are from other cultures and they have no idea about the history of the music in this country. They live in Cambridge, and folk music is part of Cambridge’s history, and they can actually relate to that. When I mention Woody Guthrie now, a lot of kids get it. They know who I’m talking about.”
The New England Folk Music Archives is the type of project that Siggins has been trying to put together for years as a way to ensure that Cambridge’s rich folk music legacy continues to be remembered and celebrated.
“I’m happy to be doing this… and to be putting together a team of people who are completely devoted to it,” she says.

5. Buttons

4. Blank Cover

9. Wannabe Na’vi makeup tutorials
Who wants to look like Lady Gaga when you can look like a taller, more agile, more brightly colored version of yourself? These make-up gurus teach you, from firsthand experience, how it’s really done on Pandora. The art of bluing yourself has reached new, more highly evolved heights.
8. “Inception” trailer parodies
While the movie blew the minds of many this summer as they tried to follow the many dreams within dreams and kicks and unexplained constructs, trailer parodies soon appeared to critique the overly serious tone of the film. These addictive parodies span from an a cappella version of the theme song to a Dora the Explorer episode. She’s so cute!
7. “Baby” by Justin Bieber
He may have only been 13, but Justin Bieber met his first love, his baby left him, and he was like, “baby, baby, baby, oh.” The combination of his baby-smooth voice, and baby-soft hair, and our love for babies had us singing along as if we were 13-year-olds with our very own haircuts named after us. Justin Bieber may be young, but we all feel the depth of his love repeated in those four heartfelt words. You say there are only technically two? Shush you. Shush.
6. “Glee” plot twists
This band of high school drama kings and queens can be streamed to the comfort of our laptops any day of the week. Whether it’s a real pregnancy, a fake pregnancy, or some other question of inter-glee incest, it’s the high school musical soap opera we’ve always wanted. Like Sue Sylvester’s deliciously cruel comments, we hate to love the show’s gimmicks, but at the same time justify our love by chanting the well-practiced mantra “We only watch it for the music.”
5. “Marcel the Shell with Shoes On”
Marcel is a shell with shoes on, and he breaks our hearts. We wish we were invited to his salad parties and we wish we could be there to help him lift his crayon—or anything at all, really. We love Marcel, with his one googly eye, two Barbie sneakers, and squeaky little wobbly voice, and we can’t help letting him tell us about his tiny life and show us around his tiny world (at incredibly high resolution) over and over again.
4. Old Spice Guy Commercials
It’s a man with rippling abs and a white towel. He’s on a boat. No, he’s on a horse. Did he just chainsaw a table and then go into a swan dive? He has no mustache. Oh, he has one. NO, IT CAN’T BE. TWO! Are those diamonds? With an aftertaste reminiscent of the Chuck Norris jokes, we can’t help but watch that swan dive one more time to figure out how he got those jeans on in one take.
3. “Pants On the Ground” by General Larry Platt
Remember the days when the winners of American Idol were more famous than the people who never made it past the auditions? General Larry Platt proves that it’s not all about winning. In the Atlanta auditions for the 2010 season, the 62-year-old performed his own original song “Pants On the Ground,” to the amusement of the judges and millions of viewers. The song, with its repetitive lyrics and blatant disregard for rhyme schemes, was picked up by a record label. To both our delight and chagrin, “Pants On the Ground,” has been extended from its original 40-second clip to a catchy three-minute public service theme song. Thank you, General Platt, for keeping us from looking like fools.
2. Robot Unicorn Attack
It has a magical robot unicorn. We don’t know how it happened, but it has pixies and rainbow attacks and two addictively simple buttons to control your fate. It may be the sadness in that broken unicorn’s eyes after being blown to smithereens, or our inability to accept the Robot Unicorn’s claim “You will fail!” Either way, we inevitably add to the 32 million plays of a game that always ends the same way with four hours left to write that paper and the game’s eerie theme song “Always,” by Erasure, stuck in our heads.
1. I Saw You Harvard
A CS50 final project that proved to be the creepiest way to fill a newly-instated J-Term that seemed to stretch into eternity. Here we discovered both Harvard students’ propensity for precise attention to detail driven by sexual frustration and our inability to look away from these all-too-revealing posts. With the new decade, we ushered in an era of unabashed fascination with discreetly watching others and then (hopefully drunkenly) telling the rest of the world about it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The success of “The Social Network” has brought to light a completely underexploited niche in popular film: the Harvard drama. But one movie is surely insufficient to quell the clamor of the masses for cinematic offerings featuring faux reconstructions of key Cambridge landmarks and stereotyped portrayals of East Coast elitists. Luckily, there are still many compelling campus storylines that have yet to be explored and fictionalized beyond all recognition. I offer them here for the benefit of studios seeking to capitalize on this exciting new market.
5. 1500 Days of Summers
The tragic story of the rise and fall of Harvard’s 27th President (sympathetically portrayed by Tom Hanks), who is undone by hubris, a bad speechwriter, and many conspiring enemies. Writer-director Oliver Stone (“JFK,” “Nixon,” “W.”) implicates the Cambridge City Council, Noam Chomsky, and the Spare Change guy (Forest Whitaker) in the plot. Cornel West cameos and wins Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. No female characters.
4. The Talented Mr. Wheeler
Leonardo DiCaprio (“Catch Me If You Can”) plays Harvard’s most famous and favorite fraud as he insinuates himself into campus life. Audiences follow Wheeler as he impersonates an English concentrator, a HUHDS chef and a Harvard administrator, endeavors which—in a surprising twist—turn out to be not that hard to pull off. Will Smith and Zoe Saldana round out a culturally diverse student body.
3. The Lamonster: Primal Scream
Is that someone hiding in the stacks or… some thing? Why are so many sophomore girls going missing after visiting the moving bookshelves in the basement? And who’s that guy wearing a Drew Faust mask in the Woodberry Poetry Room—and why does he have a chainsaw? Sarah Michelle Gellar tries to find out the answers to these troubling questions in this instant cult classic, directed by Wes Craven. Many, many sequels planned.
2. Hauser, Ph.D.
A television miniseries about the unraveling life of a seemingly perfect professor (Tom Cruise) whose charming veneer conceals a darker side. Kristen Stewart (“Twilight”) co-stars as Hauser’s jilted grad student lover who ultimately exposes him, in a minor deviation from the historical record aimed at attracting the teen demographic. Particularly impressive CGI lab monkey (Eddie Izzard) earns Emmy for Special Visual Effects.
1. Work, Actually
A documentary about what really goes on at Harvard, narrated by President Drew G. Faust. Despite many artistic shortcomings (e.g. being produced by the registrar), the film nonetheless turns a significant profit and wins the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature due to its crossing of the so-called “West Wing Threshold”—the narrative point after which audiences are sure they just saw something important, even though they have no idea what it was.

5. L-O-V-E—Nat King Cole
I actually like this song, but that doesn’t keep it from being the worst “Sesame Street” song never written. This track sounds more like an abortive attempt by Hooked On Phonics to engage the more romantically inclined of their pupils in the art of spelling. While some of the lines are admirably romantic, I can’t help but dread the inevitable Rihanna cover, “L-U-V (Is All That I Can Give 2 U).”
4. Every Breath You Take—The Police
I used to love this song.  In fourth grade, my desk buddy mocked me for singing it, and referred to it as “the stalker song.” Ever since, the romance of the song has been secondary to the creepy lyrics. Some of the highlights include “Every breath you take / Every move you make / Every bond you break / Every step you take / I’ll be watching you” and the later alterations to that formula: “Every single day / Every word you say / Every game you play / Every night you stay / I’ll be watching you.” Whoever this girl is, she has cause for a restraining order. As for me, I just wish I could listen to this song again without laughing.
3. Love and Marriage—Frank Sinatra
From the frumpy bombast of the trombones that barrel their way through the song like an overweight matchmaker through the heart of town, to the close-minded lyrics, this song is perhaps the least romantic love song ever: “Love and marriage, / Love and marriage / Go together like a horse and carriage / This I tell you brother / You can’t have one without the other.” Depending on which meaning for the word ‘love’ the songwriters are employing here, this song pretty easily justifies the practice of Shotgun weddings.
2. I’ll Be The Other Woman—The Soul Children
The lyrics for this soap opera soul track speak for themselves: “I’ll be the other woman / All your life / Just as long as I’m the only one /Other than your wife,” and “Loving a married man / This I really don’t mind / But a married Casanova / Is a little out of my line.” This woman has some self-respect, but she might be setting the bar a little low.
1. Your Love Is My Drug—Ke$ha
What scares me most about this song is how much I liked it when I first heard it. Ke$ha really gets her point across, too, by saying the word ‘love’ a grand total of 55 subtly Auto-Tuned times. She compares herself to a “lovesick crackhead,” defiantly claiming that “the rush is worth the price I pay.” The general idea behind this song is that being in love is sort of like being a crackwhore, which is really not that romantic, when you think about it. In the music video, she wakes up in the middle of a desert. The animated elephants are pretty sweet, but the video leaves some questions unanswered: how will she survive in the desert? How did she wind up in the desert? She doesn’t seem to have any water or idea of how she got there—presumably she wound up there while on a love-bender with her Jesus-wannabe love-drug. Also, if she held her listeners captive up until the end, then the spoken “I like your beard” and accompanying irritating cackle are enough to break the engagement. Perhaps the next best thing about this song is that whenever I watch the music video a Google ad tells me “You are not alone.  Let us help you—Drug and Alcohol Recovery.”
—Benjamin Naddaff-Hafrey is the incoming Music Editor. When he thinks about it, he’s very romantic.

Back when I was a wee freshman comping the Arts board, I was asked to fill out an arts related questionnaire. One of the questions was “What is your favourite album of all time?” I said “On the Beach” by Neil Young. I was lying. Here are my real all time favourite albums.
5. “Oh, Inverted World” by The Shins
I watched Garden State as a 14 year old. I refuse to comment any further.
4. “Move Along” by the All-American Rejects
I saw the All-American Rejects live not once, not twice, but three times. What of it? Tyson Ritter is super cute, and boy, did I ever wish he were my “dirty little secret.”
3. “The Young and the Hopeless” by Good Charlotte
The first song I ever learned to play on the guitar was “The Anthem” by Good Charlotte. I’m still unclear as to what “The Anthem” was an anthem for. But hey, it was fun to yell along to, jumping and ‘moshing’ at awkward middle school dances.
2.  “Silver Side Up” by Nickelback
Every once in a while I hear a whiny, horsey voice over Top 40 radio and I think to myself, “this is how you remind me of what I really [was].” Every time Nickelback releases a new single—will they ever stop?—it’s an opportunity for all of us to think about what terrible music we liked as 10-year-olds.
1. “Hybrid Theory” by Linkin Park
Who in their angsty preteen years did not love Linkin Park? The yelling, the vaguely ‘deep’ lyrics, and the cheesy, overwrought rhymes were in perfect balance to be adored. We can pretend to be too cool for nu-metal rock all we want, but “in the end, it doesn’t even matter.”
—Susie Y. Kim is the outgoing Music Editor and incoming Arts Chair. These days, she tells people that her favourite album of all time is “Slanted and Enchanted” by Pavement. She’s probably lying. She’s also Canadian, which is why she chose to spell ‘favourite’ with a ‘u’.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During Harvard-Yale weekend, Cure Lounge, a club on Boston’s tony Tremont Street, shut down a party for black students and alumni of both schools after it discovered that the majority of the guests waiting outside—in cocktail attire—weren’t carrying Harvard or Yale identification cards. An email from Michael Beal ’06, a second-year student at Harvard Business School who helped organize the party, accuses the club and its officials of racism; the club management insists that it shut down the party because of the other young people in line, “bad people” who “couldn’t spell the words ‘Harvard’ or ‘Yale’” and who might “cause trouble.”
Although Beal maintains that club officials told him his party might attract “local gangbangers” and the “wrong crowd,” there is simply not enough information to pass judgment on the thought processes of those club employees who made this decision. However, regardless of whether racism actually played a role in the events of last Saturday, the occurrence still seems an appropriate window through which to examine the way those outside the University’s gates perceive the Harvard student body. The history of race relations at Harvard is not a pleasant one, and although Harvard itself has become much more sensitive to racial issues in the recent past, the world's perception of America’s oldest university has not changed as significantly. For many, Harvard is still the mythic territory of white male elites, and this particular incident—whether or not the Cure Lounge can be called “racist”—is nevertheless an opportunity for the University to combat the popular misconceptions of what Harvard is and to whom it belongs.
First and foremost, that Harvard and Yale IDs were requested from these students and graduates suggests an uncertainty about whether they could actually belong to communities as hallowed as those of the two most prestigious universities in the United States. While we hope that such uncertainty didn’t stem from the fact that these students and graduates were black, it’s all too common for those not acquainted with the current amount of racial diversity at places like Harvard and Yale to misconstrue what today’s Harvard student actually looks like. Indeed, the typical Harvard student is no longer the wealthy Oliver Barrett IV from “Love Story,” nor is she the well-to-do Skylar from “Good Will Hunting.” In fact, there is no typical Harvard student of today whatsoever—white, black, or otherwise. But no matter how clear that fact may be to members of our community, a string of events in recent years indicates that the University would do well to communicate this message more thoroughly to an audience much wider than just its current students and faculty.
In 2007, the infamous “Quad incident” saw the Harvard University Police Department interrogate black students gathered on the Radcliffe Quad; in the summer of 2009, Henry Louis “Skip” Gates, Jr. was arrested outside his house in Cambridge after having been presumed to be breaking into his own home. These events—within the last three calendar years—all substantiate the need for better University communication on what people affiliated with Harvard look like today. In both of these additional cases, black students and faculty were afforded, as Harvard Law Professor Charles J. Ogletree, Jr. argues in a recent book on the Gates affair, “the presumption of guilt.” In that sense, even though the perception of Harvard as the property of the white elite still seems to exist outside Harvard Yard, the onus is nevertheless on the University itself to portray its student body as it is now, not as it was a number of years ago in an era that a dwindling number of Harvard affiliates would even recognize.
Of course, as Ogletree also notes in his book, the University has already taken several steps over the years to show the world that there is no typical Harvard student or faculty member, at least not anymore. In general, we appreciate the University‘s establishment of a Dean of Diversity and its commitment to diversity in faculty hiring and student acceptances. Specifically, we strongly support President Drew G. Faust’s 2008 establishment of a special review to “consider how best to assure the strongest possible relations and mutual understanding between the Harvard University Police Department and Harvard’s highly diverse community.” Other developments, such as the creation of a University Safety Advisory Committee and a public-safety ombudsman duty within the Ombudsman’s office, also warrant significant amounts of praise. Finally, the recent move to diversify Harvard’s portrait collection is similarly an excellent means of altering the public image of the Harvard affiliate on the most literal level.
We regret, however, that these initiatives—as noble and as necessary as they are—might not be enough for the potential damages caused by events like the “Quad incident,” the arrest of Professor Gates, and, most recently, the Cure Lounge shut down, whether or not it was a “racist” decision. As Ogletree himself wrote in an e-mailed statement to The Crimson Editorial Board last night, “If this were an isolated incident, that might be different. When it continues to occur, that leaves a bad taste in the mouths of current and former students. We have a lot of work to do to learn from this episode and ensure that it does not happen ever again."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard embodies a pretty strange contradiction. Everyone here is great at something, from the fastest runner in New England, to the best Starcraft player outside of South Korea, to the guy who seemed kind of lame until he invented a multibillion-dollar website.  Contrary to what you thought right after that painful midterm, the Admissions Office did, indeed, pick you for a reason, and you almost definitely have a major talent you've nurtured for years.
And yet, in the academic arena, we are told day in and day out to not rest on our laurels and to try new things. Administrators and our advisors tell us of the importance of a broad-based liberal arts education in the Harvard experience; we are urged to test out unfamiliar concentrations and take eccentric Gen Ed classes. Members of the class of 2014 will remember President Drew G. Faust's compelling answer at prefrosh weekend to a question regarding the difference between Penn and Harvard. She communicated that while Penn gives you an education that prepares you for a specific career, Harvard gives you an education for wherever life may take you.
Particularly in their extracurriculars, freshmen are unknowingly caught between these two poles; we try to follow our established talents but also want to branch out and explore new things. The problem with trying a new activity at a place like Harvard, however, is that many extracurricular activities are populated by those who were accepted to the College because of their success in said activity. Students who have had more than a decade of vocal coaching join the a cappella groups, the leads in high school plays fill the roster of Antony and Cleopatra, and national champion debaters join the debate team.
While there are plenty of introductory classes, “intro extracurriculars” are often either nonexistent or hard to find. Many students find themselves pigeonholed into what they already excel at, instead of being able to explore new interests. This is not to denigrate wholesale Harvard’s extracurricular scene; students definitely benefit from elite extracurriculars bringing together the most talented young people in their fields. I would prefer to see an improv show featuring experienced improvisers, like we have in the Immediate Gratification Players and On Thin Ice, than a show of newbies. At the same time, it is unfortunate that many extracurriculars at Harvard follow a vicious cycle: You need experience to get in, and you can’t get that experience unless you get in.
I, myself, have fallen into this trap. I had no trouble getting involved in the many political offerings on campus, but after doing improv in high school in a troupe with no auditions, I wasn’t up to snuff to get involved in Harvard’s more elite comedy scene. I certainly don’t begrudge these hilarious groups their duty to get the best performers for the job, but at the same time, it would be great to have a low-stakes environment like I had in high school. Similarly, a friend of mine who has done theater his whole life—and did get into improv here—has been trying to explore creative writing, but doesn’t have the experience to be accepted into Harvard’s high-quality publications. Something’s wrong with this picture.
Every Harvard student, since orientation, is told about the theory of a liberal arts education. But we must do a better job putting that theory into practice in extracurriculars, which serve as every student’s essential informal education. If students don’t have to declare a concentration until sophomore year, why is it that we can go through all four years without experiencing an off-the-road extracurricular simply because we don’t have the qualifications to get in and can’t get those qualifications because there’s nothing less competitive in the same field? Focusing on what you’re good at is all well and good, but at Harvard—especially at Harvard—students should have the option to break that focus and be a novice in a new activity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tomorrow, hundreds of students and community members will gather in Boston Common in honor of World AIDS Day. We will gather not only to remember the 25 million people whose lives have been taken by AIDS but also to hold our leaders accountable for the promises they made to fight this epidemic.
One such promise was made in 2007 by then-presidential candidate Barack H. Obama. In 2007, AIDS advocates politely went to town hall meetings in New Hampshire and Iowa during the presidential primary season, asking candidates to commit to spending $50 billion by 2013 for global AIDS programs. Through our concerted efforts, we managed to get Hillary R. Clinton, Joseph R. Biden, and Obama to all promise to dedicate $50 billion by 2013 to the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the Global Fund to treat and prevent global AIDS, including $1 billion in new money every year.
For the past two years, however, it has become increasingly clear that simply electing a leader who campaigned on a platform of hope, change, and increased AIDS funding is not enough. President Obama’s actions on global AIDS have fallen appallingly short of his campaign pledges. Though during his speeches he may have claimed to have “increased funding for AIDS,” his budget “increases” for the PEPFAR—the principal U.S. funding body for global health—have barely kept pace with inflation. He asked Congress for a $0.2 billion increase in 2009 and $0.1 billion increase in 2010—one-tenth of what he promised.
Many continue to claim that flat-lining funding to combat the AIDS pandemic was the best Mr. Obama could do given the global financial crisis. They say that there is no money in an already-tightened budget. However, money can easily be found for presidential priorities. For the New Start Treaty for nuclear weapons, the administration was able to find an extra $4 billion for weapon modernization at the drop of a hat last week, in addition to the $80 billion it had already promised for weapon modernization programs. Yet when asked to fulfill a campaign promise of a $1 billion increase to combat the global AIDS epidemic, the administration claims that there is no money. It is clear that the global AIDS epidemic is not a priority for President Obama like it was for candidate Obama.
We recognize that politicians often fail to deliver on campaign promises. But as university students committed to global health improvement, we are taking it upon ourselves to stand up at this pivotal moment and hold our government accountable for this devastating regression. We have served in communities around the globe and have witnessed, first-hand, the extent to which AIDS can destroy families and undermine economies. Millions of people with AIDS, including mothers and children, are deprived of life-saving treatment because of funding shortfalls. We are learning from studies, such as one published a recently in The Lancet, that global flat funding could lead to an additional seven million deaths and 14 million new HIV infections over the next 20 years. The cost of inaction is painfully high.
Increased funding for PEPFAR would not only save lives, but would also prevent the spread of AIDS. Studies showed that antiretroviral treatment reduces HIV transmission by 92 percent, making it the single most effective form of prevention. Further, treating AIDS comprehensively, as PEPFAR has shown is possible, improves care for other diseases like tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections and has been shown to boost primary health care in even the most desperate settings. Rarely do we see something this close to a win-win in global health.
The neglect of AIDS and other global health inequities is the most pressing moral issue of our time—on par with slavery in the 19th century, and civil and women’s rights in the 20th century. But if we are to make fighting this epidemic a presidential and congressional priority, we must publicly hold our leaders to account for their bold promises. We therefore urge those who want to see a world free of HIV/AIDS to come to Boston Common tomorrow from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. to stand in solidarity in support of those suffering from a treatable illness. Together, we will urge President Obama to ask Congress for increases in global AIDS funding and work to fulfill his campaign promise to dedicate $50 billion to global AIDS treatment by 2013.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the highest number since 1959, approximately 43.6 million Americans lived in poverty in 2009. Devastatingly, this included “almost one in four American children under the age of six.” A record number of Americans now depend on food stamps for their meals, as hunger creeps into over 50 million households.
This holiday season will be one of the toughest in memory for America’s least fortunate. Unemployment has barely budged in months, while many of the federal and state programs that constitute America’s weak safety net are set to expire or run out of funds. America’s rapidly expanding poor population will need substantial assistance from the government and private individuals to make it through the winter.
Government policy is far and away the most powerful tool to alleviate this devastating spread of poverty. Increased food-stamp funding from the stimulus bill has been a critical lifeline for the poor to gain access to food, and extended unemployment benefits have been the only source of funds for the non-senior jobless. This unemployment insurance is in danger of expiring on Nov. 30 for many long-term jobless, leaving them without funds and resources during the harsh winter.
There is a strong macroeconomic incentive to continue and expand these programs. Programs including food stamps and unemployment insurance have some of the highest gross domestic product multipliers because the poor will almost certainly spend all of their funds. A dollar spent to provide food stamps creates $1.74 in economic activity, while $1 on unemployment benefits will create $1.61 in economic activity.
Funds in the stimulus that employed workers, such as the Employment Contingency Fund—which paid private companies to keep employees in their jobs—and state and local aid—which funded many public sector jobs—also prevented poverty while placing incomes in hands where it would be spent. When our economy is struggling to move in the right direction, it is confounding that Congress is not continuing many of our most effective macroeconomic policies. Republican filibusters to any additional aid to the poor or stimulus show a fundamental lack of concern with the health of the economy or the plight of the poor.
Helping the poor makes a great deal of economic sense, but, even more importantly, it is a moral imperative. No child deserves to go without meals or warm clothing in the dark days of January; no single mother should have to choose between spending on one child over the other. A society should and must be judged by how it treats its least fortunate, and that’s why, regardless of Congress’s actions, private citizens do what we can to ensure that every American has a meal to eat and the resources to get through the winter this holiday season. It is important to continue to lobby Congress on behalf of the poor because the government can act at a much greater scale than can charities. That said, there are various causes that Americans can support independently with their time and resources.
Feeding America is a network of America’s food banks that provides food to one in eight Americans. It covers almost every county in the nation and is a vital resource for America’s neediest. A donation as small as $1 can provide three meals, and the need for this food is as great as it’s ever been. With a small contribution, you might end up providing breakfast for a child before he goes to school or Christmas dinner for a family in need.
At donorschoose.org, you can provide a small donation to a classroom in need and allow a project or curriculum that was in doubt to come to fruition. Students might learn a special curriculum about democracy or read a new book because of your small gift. A classroom in a poverty-laden town in Texas needs funds for audiobooks for hearing-impaired students, and a classroom in California needs a carpet so that the kids can sit down, read aloud, and build community.
There are countless other organizations that help support America’s poor during tough times, including many here at Harvard and in the Boston area. Time is a very valuable resource to donate as well, and nonprofits and charities always need extra volunteers during the holiday season. The circumstances demand that we each find some way to support America’s poorest over the next few months and encourage those closest to us to do the same.
These are dark days for America’s poor, and the government seems unlikely to extend and solidify the weak safety net and support system that it has provided for the poor, despite the clear economic and moral imperatives in favor of doing so. Thus, it is essential that Americans privately step in to fill the gap. Through donations and volunteering, we can help ensure that, despite the highest levels of poverty in decades, every American can find a little stability and comfort this holiday season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A spokesperson for the Cure Lounge said allegations of discrimination against black Harvard and Yale students at a Nov. 20 party for graduate students and alumni that was shut down were “absolutely baloney,” citing poor organization from event promoters as the primary reason for the club management’s decision to end the event prematurely.
George Regan, the spokesperson for the club, said that event promoters insisted that those in the crowd without Harvard or Yale IDs be admitted on the night of the event, despite concerns from club security that people unaffiliated with either university and known to cause trouble were trying to gain entry.
Regan said the event organizers had previously agreed while attempting to obtain the venue for the party that only those with Harvard or Yale IDs would be admitted. Because the promoters decided to violate the precondition, the club management shut the party down, he said.
By insisting that the club security not check IDs, Regan said the event promoters “wanted those people inside the club,” referring to the “local gang bangers” that security guards said they spotted in the crowd.
In e-mails to attendees before and after the event, event promoters did not say that proof of university affiliation was a precondition for entry to the event. In an e-mail obtained by The Crimson sent from the event promoters to the attendees the day before the event containing “important information” about the party, event organizer Kwame Owusu-Kesse ’06 cited other preconditions stipulated by Cure Lounge, but mentioned nothing about needing university IDs.
Sadatu K. Dennis, a student at the Harvard Graduate School of Design who attended the party, said that she did not understand why club management told attendees that the event was closing due to technical difficulties with the stereo system if the real rationale was a concern about club security.
Dennis said when she got to the club around 10 p.m.—45 minutes before the management announced they were shutting the party down—she did not see anyone outside the club who did not appear to be affiliated with Harvard or Yale, and said she was not asked to show her Harvard ID.
But Regan maintains that the issue revolved around IDs to ensure the club’s security, an issue that Cure takes particularly seriously, he says.
In 2008, the club—then called Aria Nightclub—closed after a brawl broke out and a man opened fire on the crowd. After a two-year lapse, the club is reopening with a new name, according to Regan.
Event promoters and organizers Owusu-Kesse and Michael Beal ’06, both second year students at Harvard Business School, did not return e-mails and phone calls seeking comment.
Despite Regan’s assurances that the event organizers are at fault, the club will face investigation by the City of Boston Licensing Division, according to Boston City Councillor Ayanna Pressley’s Chief of Staff James Chisholm.
Chisholm acknowledged that the inquiry was an “investigation of accusations” and said that Pressley called for it after hearing accounts from students who attended the event. Following the investigation, the City of Boston Licensing Board will determine whether the club will retain its license to conduct business, he said.
“The councillor feels very strongly that an investigation is warranted after hearing accounts [of the night],” Chisholm said. “This is something that doesn’t reflect the best of Boston.”

Faculty leaders from the Committee on Degrees in Social Studies will host a discussion with members of the Social Studies community on Dec. 7 about the grants that will be available next semester from the Marty Peretz Fund, which will largely sponsor senior thesis research and partly cover other undergraduate research-related expenses.
The $650,000 fund, which was established by friends of Martin H. “Marty” Peretz in honor of the former Social Studies head tutor, was the center of a large debate after Peretz’s controversial blogpost in which he claimed that “Muslim life is cheap.” The dialogue culminated in the Social Studies Standing Committee’s decision to accept the gift just before the committee’s fiftieth anniversary celebration in late September­.
Committee Chair Richard Tuck and Director of Studies Anya Bernstein will lead the presentation on the allocation of the fund, which will conclude in an open floor for questions and comments, according to an e-mail Bernstein sent yesterday.
Undergraduate concentrators expressed curiosity upon receiving Bernstein’s e-mail.
“The controversy has been a very loaded topic,” said Social Studies concentrator Kristine E. Beckerle ’11, who plans to attend the event. “I’d want to see what the resolution is and what Social Studies’ reasoning is for taking the money.”
Adan Acevedo ’13, who was one of the organizers of a 40-student walk-out protesting the fund during a Social Studies 10 lecture in early October, said that he plans to attend the presentation.
“I think we made our position clear [in the walk-out],” Acevedo said. “And it’s great that we finally have this chance to talk about it.”
Bernstein declined to comment for this article.

European Commissioner for Financial Programming and Budget Janusz Lewandowski discussed solutions to the financial crisis last night as part of a series of conversations on the challenges of the 21st century from American and European perspectives.
Lewandowski emphasized the economic links that bind the United States and the EU as they recover from the global financial crisis.
“Europe and America are most dependent on each other,” he said, noting that the accumulated American investment in Ireland is greater in magnitude than the total American investment in either China,  Brazil, or any other developing nation.
Economics Professor Phillipe Aghion, who chaired the event, introduced Lewandowski to the audience and queried him on the future of European and global economic policy.
When asked whether Europe could overcome the current financial crisis and achieve sustainable long-term growth, Lewandowski responded with a declarative “Yes, we can,” expressing his view that Europe and the world will find opportunity in the crisis.
Quoting an old medical definition of the word crisis as “the point at which a disease kills or changes for the better,” Lewandowski said that the current economic crisis could be a “catalyst for improvement.”
He added that despite the economic ties that link Europe and America, the regions must take different approaches to their financial troubles. Europe must consolidate economic power and reduce spending if it truly wishes to build a permanent anti-crisis mechanism, he said.
Lewandowski also talked about practical steps for dealing with the next financial crisis, advocating for a more data-based approach and a heavier reliance on statistics to govern economic policy.
Mathieu Segers, a visiting scholar at the Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies, said that Lewandowski’s comments regarding the harmonization of the Euro Zone were “very bold,” considering what he described as European nations’ reluctance to transfer economic power to Brussels.
The ongoing series of discussions is organized by CES Associate Renée Haferkamp. It is co-sponsored by the CES, the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, and the Karamalis Chair at Tufts University.

Former Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer expressed his conviction that Detroit can recover from its current economic slump during a discussion with political leaders at the Harvard Kennedy School last night.
Archer pointed out that Detroit was “turning around” during his time as mayor. and added that the city has the potential to change again for the better.
Archer and the other speakers on the panel discussed the economic climate of cities within the Rust Belt, the manufacturing area of the United States that is comprised of parts of the Northeastern, Mid-Atlantic, and Midwestern states.
The cities within this area once relied largely on businesses like the steel and coal industries that have declined in financial productivity in recent years, causing widespread joblessness, Archer said.
“We’re here today to discuss what in the world a reasonable response would be to that [problem],” said Edward Glaeser, director of the Taubman Center for State and Local Government and the moderator of the event.
Denise DiPasquale, the president of City Research—a research firm whose major focus is urban economics—offered Pittsburgh as an example of a Rust Belt city that has managed to recover from the decline in industry. However, DiPasquale cautioned that though economic growth is possible, Pittsburgh still faces huge fiscal problems and has been named a financially distressed city by the state of Pennsylvania.
Barry Bluestone, dean in the School of Public Policy and Urban Affairs at Northeastern University, blamed the decline of Detroit on the dominance of the automobile industry—which he said discouraged other industries from establishing themselves in the area—as well as on a lack of good leadership in the city with the exception of Archer.
Bluestone suggested that it was necessary to make “mayors the CEOs for economic development” in order to repair the economies of struggling cities.
“That means understanding the strengths and weaknesses of your own community; trying to figure out what the opportunities are, as well as the threats,” Bluestone said.
Allyson Baughman, a doctoral student in public policy at the University of Massachusetts, said that she saw the issues discussed by the panel as important because of their potential consequences on the national level.
“I think that what is happening in cities, if we don’t address it, is eventually going to leak into the suburbs,” Baughman said.

Despite a reputation for poor quality control in its exports, China has made strides in improving food safety regulations in recent years, argued University of Wisconsin Law School Professor Stephanie Tai yesterday.
New research grants and punitive measures, as well as increased clarity on existing legislation, have helped efforts to contain and prevent food contamination in China in the past year, said Tai in her lecture.
Recent efforts to improve food safety are motivated by a desire to improve the “Made in China” brand, which has been damaged by numerous incidents in past years. Tai cited the US Food and Drug Administration’s decision to detain farm-raised seafood from China in 2007 and Japan’s discovery of insecticide contamination in dumplings shipped from China in 2008 as examples of China’s poor track record in food safety.
Tai added that a growing domestic movement in China demanding safer products, such as organic food, has also played a part in encouraging food safety reform.
Despite the improvements, Tai said China still has more to do before its food safety problems are solved.
Current challenges hindering further improvements in China include public apathy, a lack of public education and awareness, and the limited power of non-governmental organizations in the Chinese political system, she said.
In an interview with The Crimson after the event, Tai took spoke optimistically about the potential for improvements and reform in the quality of Chinese food exports.
Tai said that the foundation for improved food safety regulations are now in place, and that China will over time fill in the gaps with subsequent legislation.
“Food is such a visceral topic that the people and the government of China have likely driven the change,” she said.

Studies in Kenya and Gambia have shown that preventing malaria and anemia in schoolchildren may be a more effective way to improve education levels than direct intervention in schooling, said Graduate School of Education Assistant Professor Matthew Jukes in a speech yesterday.
“School-based prevention is a quick win for the education sector,” said Jukes in his lecture, which focused on his research on the effects of malaria and anemia on education in Kenya and Gambia.
Malaria and anemia—both relatively common diseases in Africa—can be detrimental to education levels not only by causing ill students to dropout, but also by hurting the cognitive abilities of students who remain in school, said Jukes, citing a study that found that anemia was correlated with a decrease of six points in IQ scores.
Improving education through disease prevention is also a highly cost-effective solution, he said. While the cost of training teachers is $8.29 per child to improve performance on cognitive tests, school-age malaria treatment can lead to similar improvements at a cost of $1.88 per child, according to Jukes.
Malaria prevention has the potential to improve education levels on a large scale worldwide, Jukes said, because hundreds of millions of school-aged children are affected by malaria. Prevention efforts can also promote equity because the poor are more likely to be affected by malaria, he added.
Some of the roughly 30 people in attendance at the event found Jukes argument compelling.
Francis Serufusa Sekidde, a student at the Harvard School of Public Health, said that the talk presented convincing evidence of the relationship between education and health sectors, giving a new area of focus for future agendas.
If the spillover effects of malaria prevention are shown to be true, prevention initiatives could be used to benefit the economies of countries heavily affected by malaria, said HSPH student Guy D. Harling.
But other attendees were less enthusiastic about Jukes’s findings.
HSPH student Aparna Chandrasekhar said that although she believed there was a correlation, she still was not convinced of a causative relationship between disease prevention and improvements in education.

A 57-year old man was fatally injured after being struck by an inbound Red Line train at the Kendall Square station yesterday morning.
According to the Cambridge Chronicle, the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority has identified the victim, but no details have been released.
“The investigation is ongoing,” MBTA spokesperson Joe Pesaturo wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson.
First responders to the incident, which took place around 11:20 a.m., shut down power to the third rail of the subway tracks in order to reach the victim.
As a result, Red Line service between Park Street and Harvard Square was temporarily suspended, and shuttle buses were used to ferry passengers while the MBTA Transit Police began their investigation.
Lily L. Hsiang ’13 was riding the Red Line back to Harvard following Thanksgiving break and was at the Park Street station when the incident occurred.
“First [the subway conductor] said that we were going express to Harvard Square...Then we were told there was an emergency medical situation at Kendall Square and that we had to get off the train,” Hsiang said.
The passengers then exited the train at Park Street where, according to Hsiang, bus service was not yet available.  “Everyone was just mobbing for cabs,” she said.
By 1:30 p.m., bus service was discontinued and Red Line operation returned to normal between the two locations.
The Kendall Square incident follows other recent subway-related deaths. On Nov. 15, a 41-year old woman was hit and killed by an Orange Line train, and a 74-year old man was killed in October when he slipped and fell underneath a commuter rail train in Newton. In May 2009, a Red Line train at Porter Square struck and killed a man.

More than 150 Massachusetts students—some holding white posters, others wearing black graduation caps—gathered at the Cathedral of St. Paul yesterday afternoon to raise awareness for a bill that would grant amnesty to undocumented students.
At the community rally organized by the Student Immigrant Movement—a youth-led statewide organization advocating for immigrant rights—local educational and political leaders expressed the urgency of passing the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, which is expected to come to a vote in the Senate this week.
If passed, the act would provide some undocumented youth with a six-year conditional path to citizenship upon the completion of two years of higher education or two years of military service.
“We need all of you in college—every one of you in college,” said Wayne Burton, president of Northshore Community College to the sea of graduation caps—a symbol of students fighting for an education—and raised posters at the rally that proclaimed, “Let us learn; Let us serve.”
David Hildt, former mayor of Amesbury and executive director of Adelante Youth CenterMembers, and Harvard Extension School student and illegal immigrant Megha Kapoor also spoke at the rally.
“It’s going to take a lot of pressure to get the bill passed in the Senate,” said Deivid L. S. Ribeiro, communications associate for the Student Immigrant Movement.
About 25 student representatives from campus groups such as the Harvard College Democrats, Harvard College Act on a Dream, Fuerza Latina, and the Student Labor Action Movement attended the rally.
“If it doesn’t pass now, given the change in legislature, it could take two years, and it’s already been 10 years... This is critical,” said Karen A. Narefsky ’11, who joined SLAM her sophomore year.
“The time for large scale outside rallies was before,” said Christine Hurd ’13, communications director for Harvard College Democrats who attended the rally, “but now it’s come down to the wire.”
Students were not the only attendees of the rally.
Edward B. Childs, the chief steward of the Local 26 division of the UNITE HERE labor union, represented the Harvard University dining hall workers and was one of the many recipients of an honorary degree from DREAM University.
“For workers, [the DREAM Act] is extremely important,” Childs said. “All our children are entitled to an education.”

Cambridge Health Alliance, a Harvard-affiliated public healthcare system, was named to Harvard Pilgrim Health Care’s 2010 Pediatric Honor Roll on Nov. 23.
This is the fourth time the system, which serves Cambridge, Somerville, and Boston, received the honor, but the first year that it was awarded the added “with distinction” designation.
Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, a private health insurance provider, has published the Harvard Pilgrim Physician Group Honor Roll annually for the past nine years as part of its strategy to recognize quality care. The honor roll is intended to provide the public with a list of “quality care providers” to use as a reference when selecting a primary care physician.
“The honor roll started as an acknowledgment to honor exemplary care,” said Joanna Kaplan, senior communications specialist at HPHC. “It is a nice distinction to make the roll year after year. It shows [CHA’s] consistency in providing quality care.”
For the Honor Roll, providers are judged on performance against five selected preventive and chronic quality criteria, including well child and adolescent visits, chlamydia screening, upper respiratory infection management and treatment of children with pharyngitis, according to Kaplan.
CHA was one of 36 practices to be named to the Pediatric Honor Roll With Distinction this year, which means the practice outperformed over 90 percent of other health care systems on all five measures, according to Kaplan.
“Having this honor is a confirmation that through a lot of hard work, our department has figured out ways to provide effective, comprehensive care for children,” said David A. Link ’66, chief of pediatrics at CHA and an associate professor of pediatrics at the Medical School.
CHA is a Medical School teaching affiliate largely staffed by individuals associated with HMS that offers residency opportunities for medical students, according to David Cecere, director of media relations for CHA.
CHA delivers pediatric care in 17 different areas and sees over 30,000 children each year. The hospital touts its work with children with asthma and children with attention deficit disorder.
“Addressing these issues requires sophisticated and coordinated effort,” Link said. “We have a strong attention to detail with superb support from our nursing staff.”
Link says he hopes these efforts will continue to be recognized as CHA begins to use new medical technology, such as an ADHD electronic registry.
A total of 54 practices throughout Massachusetts, Maine, and New Hampshire were named to the honor roll, according to a press release from CHA.

Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will deliver the first of a three-part lecture series titled “American Foreign Policy and the Black Experience” at 8 p.m. today at the Institute of Politics.
The three talks, which will take place over the course of this week, are part of the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research Lecture Series and will be published by the Harvard University Press.
Rice served as the National Security Advisor under President George W. Bush during his first term and as Secretary of State during his second term in office. During her time as secretary, Rice was known as a champion for the expansion of democratic governments internationally and for her policies supporting human rights in the Middle East.
Rice has been criticized, however, for her support of the war in Iraq and former President Bush’s counter-terrorism policies.
W.E.B. Du Bois Institute Director and Professor of African and African American Studies Henry Louis “Skip” Gates, Jr. said that Rice was selected by the executive board of the Du Bois Insitute to present a series of three lectures over the course of the week focusing on foreign policy and African American history.
“Condoleezza is someone I admire tremendously,” Gates said. “I know that Secretary Rice is brilliant and these will be historic lectures.”
The three lectures will focus on U.S. foreign policy in Africa, multi-ethnic diversity in America, and the importance of democracy abroad. Her lecture today is titled “The National Interest, Africa, and the African Diaspora: Does US Foreign Policy Connect the Dots?”
Gates said that Secretary Rice’s lecture series represents “one of the only times someone has written about American foreign policy and African Americans,” Gates said. “I can’t wait to host her at Harvard and hear her speak.”
Gracie A. Hurley ’14, who plans to attend Rice’s lecture today, said that she hopes the event will be both inspirational and educational.
“I wanted to see Condoleezza Rice because I want to learn more about her life and accomplishments,” Hurley said. “I would love to hear some of her stories and see if I would be interested in a similar career.”
Rice worked as a professor of political science at Stanford University before joining the Bush administration. In March 2009 she returned to the school as a political science professor and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace.
The next two lectures in Rice’s series will take place on Wednesday at 4 p.m. in Askwith Hall, and on Thursday at 4 p.m. in Longfellow Hall.

The Undergraduate Council allocated $20,000 last night to 35 student-sponsored programs to hold events during Optional Winter Activities Week, the final week before the beginning of the spring semester.
The UC has spearheaded funding for student-initiated events for the inaugural OWAW, during which time the College will re-open to all students.
The UC granted OWAW funding to recognized student groups, including grants to fund a Harvard Ski Club trip and a film project for Harvard Undergraduate Television.
And although term-time UC grants are only available to College-recognized student groups, students not affiliated with official groups were also eligible to apply for OWAW funding. Independent programs the Council will fund this January include a laser tag outing and a brewing workshop.
Many of the student-sponsored programs—such as a raffle for Celtics tickets, and a trip to the New England Aquarium—focused on opportunities for students to explore Boston.
“One of the things we hear that Harvard students complain about is that they have this great resource of Boston that they don’t take have the time to take advantage of,” said UC Finance Committee Chair Luis A. Martinez ’12.
Bryan Cortez ’13, who has organized a series of outings in Boston, including a trip to the North End, said he was satisfied with the UC grant process for his proposed activities.
But he added that he was worried that the lack of publicity for the funding may have limited the number and types of events students proposed to the Council.
Martinez expressed concerns that the UC funding—the only source of funding for student-initiated programming during the week—was insufficient to support an extensive range of student-initiated events, saying that $20,000 “isn’t going to make a fantastic week.”
In addition to the student-sponsored, UC-funded programming, students will also be able to participate in January Arts Intensives—a series of arts workshops—and several faculty-proposed events. The deadline to register an official OWAW program is this Friday, Dec. 3.
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds expressed optimism about OWAW.
“Coming back a week early and not just two days before classes start is a good thing, in my opinion,” said Hammonds in an interview earlier this month. She added that students can also use the time to plan for spring classes, go to the Office of Career Services, and begin working on summer fellowship applications.
Over the next month, the UC will work to publicize the optional week and encourage students to participate in the 35 approved programs, according to UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11.
“We need to make sure people actually know to book flights back in time,” Hysen said.

Two Harvard seniors—P. Kenzie Bok ’11 and Jonathan U. Warsh ’11—were awarded the prestigious Marshall Scholarship, the University announced yesterday.
Warsh and Bok join 247 Harvard students who have been awarded the Marshall Scholarship since its founding in 1953. The scholarship funds two years of postgraduate study in the United Kingdom, with the possibility of a year-long extension.
Up to 40 American undergraduates are awarded the Marshall Scholarship every year. Applicants to the scholarship must have a minimum GPA of 3.7.
Warsh, a government concentrator with a secondary concentration in global health and health policy in Lowell House, said he learned of his award two weeks ago, after 24 hours of anxious waiting. Told that he would find out on Monday, Nov. 15, Warsh received an e-mail that evening telling him there had been a delay. On Tuesday, he received an e-mail confirming his scholarship.
“Well, I’m going to England,” he recalled telling his roommate. “And then we had lunch.”
Warsh credits his work at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, where he is currently the administrative director, for exposing him to our “fragmented healthcare system.”
As a Marshall Scholar, he wants to learn how Europe has made strides to reduce inequalities in healthcare, and whether those methods can be applied in the United States.
In his first year, he will pursue a joint Master of Science at the London School of Economics and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Afterwards, he is considering another year studying at LSHTM.
Bok, a Pforzheimer House history concentrator, is the president of the Institute of Politics.
She said she will use the scholarship to continue her research in intellectual history at the University of Cambridge.
In her first year, Bok will pursue a degree in theology. Afterwards, she said she will continue her studies in intellectual history and political thought.
“The two centers for the study of intellectual history are actually here at Harvard and at Cambridge,” she said.
Bok said she wants to explore whether secular ethics owe their beginnings to religious traditions.
“To really understand texts, you need to contextualize them,” she said, explaining that many secular political thinkers came from religious backgrounds.
Although she had known about the scholarship “sort of vaguely, for a long time,” Bok did not decide to apply until becoming invested in her senior thesis. She said advisors told her, “You may want to keep this on your horizon.”
After her interview in mid-November, she thought about “the 20 ways in which it had been unsuccessful” until getting the congratulatory call five days later.
“Given Kenzie’s interests in religion, intellectual history, and politics, the M.Phil. programs at Cambridge are ideal for her,” wrote her thesis adviser, History Professor James T. Kloppenberg, in an e-mail. “She has done very well balancing her multiple commitments at Harvard, and I believe she will flourish doing the same thing in the other Cambridge.”

Ivy League soccer has finally come to an end.
Although the regular season ended weeks ago, the Dartmouth and Brown men’s soccer teams played their final games last weekend.
Both Ivy teams lost in their NCAA Championship Sweet Sixteen matchups on Sunday. This year marks the first in over a decade in which two Ancient Eight squads were still standing so late into tournament. Princeton and Penn also made it to the postseason, losing in earlier matchups.
The Bears made it to the final 16 with a first-round win over Boston College and a thrilling penalty-kick victory over Connecticut last week. But on Sunday, Brown suffered a 2-0 defeat at the hands of sixth-seeded Cal in Berkeley, Calif.
The Big Green shutout Monmouth, its first opponent of the tournament, and had a similarly close second round game, getting by Notre Dame in 2-1 overtime win. But Dartmouth’s luck in extra time ran out as it fell, 2-1, in a double-overtime heartbreaker against eighth-seeded UCLA in Los Angeles,  Calif., on Sunday.
Despite the disappointing end, this year saw four Ivy League men’s teams make it into the NCAA Championship field for the second consecutive season, a feat that hadn’t been accomplished since the 1970s.
Harvard (5-7-5, 2-3-2 Ivy) failed to reach the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2005.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the modern era of sports, being a college coach carries with it the burden of constant media attention. Facing dozens of reporters at press conferences, head coaches have gotten savvier—they say what they need to and leave the rest up for speculation. Here at The Back Page, we’re happy to decode some of these media sessions, showing the average fan what we think coaches’ answers “really” mean. 
Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker was pleased but not overly enthusiastic after the Crimson’s victory over Colorado Sunday afternoon. Though the 82-66 blowout represented the program’s first-ever win against a Big 12 school, it is easy to tell that Harvard’s focus remains on the long season ahead and the numerous obstacles in the way of bringing to Cambridge another program “first”: an Ivy League championship. The coach broke down some of those potential stumbling blocks in the post-game media conference.
What Amaker said (after a reporter remarked that junior big man Keith Wright “may have played himself into a lottery pick today”): “Well, let’s not get carried away. Certainly, Keith has played well. I’m very pleased with his production. I wish we could get him to play a little bit better defense. He’s getting into foul trouble a little bit because of sloppy plays and not being in position. Usually if you’re out of position it’s going to probably lead to fouls—that’s been the case with Keith a little bit, but we have been very pleased with his production.”
What Amaker means: By no means stingy with praise for the co-captain, Amaker honed in one of the few potentially major chinks in Wright’s armor. Double teams have presented a relatively minor obstacle for him thus far this season, but if teams go hard at Wright on the offensive end, early fouls could keep him on the bench (as they did in the Nov. 20 Mercer game). After the loss of its starting center early in the season, the Buffaloes were in no shape to challenge the Crimson inside. Keeping Wright on the floor and out of foul trouble will be a key concern for Harvard as the year continues.
What Amaker said (when asked about the status of sophomore Kyle Casey): “He’s coming. Not nearly where we’d like for him to be, but it’s a process. We’re throwing him in there here and there, getting him some minutes and trying to work him back in slowly and surely. You can see: timing, rustiness...he fouled out, those kinds of things. But certainly we don’t win today without Kyle having some presence for us and getting us some confidence. When they went small, we had to go small to match with them and Kyle helped us do that.”
What Amaker means: After an impressive freshman campaign, the pressure has mounted for Casey to make an instant impact upon his return from a broken foot suffered in the preseason. But as Amaker readily admits, so far the forward has looked out of sorts, particularly on the offensive end. The current priority for Harvard appears to be adjusting Casey back into the squad over the long haul—with an eye towards league play beginning in late January—rather than relying on the wing to help navigate the rest of the team’s arduous non-conference schedule. His performance last year indicated that Casey’s potential (and importance) is sky-high, but Amaker’s expectations will undoubtedly remain modest for the time being.
What Amaker said: “I thought Andrew [Van Nest, a 6’11” junior] played very well. We picked up a lot of fouls I wish we wouldn’t have with Keith, Andrew, and Kyle. We played all our post guys—we played [freshman Ugo Okam], we played [sophomore Jeff Georgatos], and then Van Nest and Kyle. I think the rotation of those guys is going to be very helpful for the rest of our season. We’re going to need bodies to be able to go to and rely on for a number of different situations...I was pleased that we were able to have some production from our post players.”
What Amaker means: The squad’s weakness clearly lies in its front-court depth; with Casey still adjusting to being back out on the floor, Amaker lacks a consistent interior presence besides Wright. A serious concern at the beginning of the season, the development of the team’s remaining big men (as they simply learn to defend and rebound) is worth watching closely game by game. Okam and Georgatos are still finding their way around the court (they were non-factors Sunday afternoon), but the coach has stated repeatedly that he is holding the relatively senior Van Nest to a higher standard. Though he still appears far more comfortable on the perimeter, perhaps Van Nest’s emphatic dunk against the Buffaloes will awaken a grittier personal style that could allay Amaker’s worries and pay heavy dividends for the Crimson.

Christmas decorations and cold weather have come to Cambridge, but as it has yet to snow, the Harvard alpine and Nordic ski teams travelled to whiter pastures over Thanksgiving break. The alpine squad headed to Colorado, while the Nordic team travelled north to Quebec, where they competed in the USCan Cup at Forêt Montmorency.
And while most students were sitting on their couches watching football, some of the Crimson’s youngest skiers proved themselves among the best in the East.
Leading the charge was rookie Chris Stock, who had a strong showing at the two-nation event, nearly winning the 1k Classic event in his first weekend of collegiate racing. Peter Hegman, a sophomore from the University of Vermont, edged out Stock for the win by a tenth of a second. Stock placed 12th in his other event.
The high finish by the Harvard skier may have been surprising to the Crimson’s EISA opponents, but according to Nordic coach Chris City ’94, Stock demonstrated potential all fall when the team trained on roller skis.
“The first time we ran [our time trial] this fall, he broke the course record,” City said.
Sophomore Alena Tofte gave the women’s squad a second-place finish of its own with her performance in the 1k Classic event. Tofte and Natalie Ruppertsberger, a senior at Bates, tied for second behind Vermont junior Caitlin Patterson.
“She did some really good training,” City said. “She put in a lot of hours. She has a lot strength she didn’t have last year...We’ve been seeing that in the fall.”
“[This weekend was] a confidence builder for her—to see the work she did is translating. I think that’s encouraged her going into the season. We’ve got good hopes for her this season,” he added.
Meanwhile, the women’s Nordic squad may have found a new star in rookie Jen Rolfes. The Edina, Minn. native placed sixth in the 4k Free event and was fourth among U.S. skiers. An All-American in 2008, Rolfes was Harvard’s second-best finisher in the 1k Classic event, placing 13th.
“She came in with a pretty strong high school racing background,” City said. “She skied well in the sprint on Saturday. She’s a talented racer. We see things from her racing that we don’t see in practice. She’s got this extra gear that we see when she’s racing.”
Rolfes and Stock are part of a core of underclassmen that will play a big role in the team’s success this year.
“We’ve been lucky with the incoming classes,” City said. “It’s been a group of athletes that have come in with a higher level of preparation and have come out of strong athletic programs. They come out with a level of experience that we haven’t had in the past.”
According to City, the rookies’ fitness has allowed the team to train harder than it has in the past.
“What we’re doing now is harder and more challenging than the work we were doing a year ago and much harder than the work we were doing two or three years ago, and that’s because this is a group that came in not only prepared but also eager. Every time we throw a challenge at them, they come back for more.”
While it didn’t have the opportunity to test its mettle in racing this past weekend, the alpine team also saw promise from its younger classes in last year’s season, when then-rookie Catherine Sheils placed eighth at the EISA championships, and in the fall.
This year the team welcomes freshman Rebecca Nadler. The 2010 Eastern Cup Overall Champion, Nadler could find similar success.
“She has a lot of experience in races that are of a similar caliber to college races,” Sheils said. “I think she’s going to be a really great addition to the team.”
With its rookie class ready to go and its veterans returning in top shape, the ski team is ready to outperform its competition this winter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fifteen NBA Scouts were on hand Sunday afternoon at Lavietes Pavilion to watch and evaluate high-scoring Colorado guards Alec Burks and Cory Higgins.
But throughout the game, it wasn’t a Buffalo who was the contest’s dominant force. Instead, Harvard junior co-captain Keith Wright was the best player on the court Sunday, just as he’s been all season long.
The center played 32 minutes, filling up the stat sheet in every category. He finished with 19 points on 8-of-11 shooting, to go with nine rebounds, a career-high six assists, and three blocks.
Wright was a force to be reckoned with, as all game long the Crimson guards fed the ball inside to their co-captain, who would finish with a layup, and at times, a dunk, bringing energy to the crowd and his teammates and leading Harvard to its first-ever win over a Big 12 school.
“[Wright]’s been a stellar performer for us this whole season,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “He’s anchored the interior for us, and when you have an interior post presence that is playing at the level where he is right now–very productive and effective—it allows our perimeter players to have the freedom to drive, to penetrate, to pitch.”
The junior set the tone early on that his team had no interest in being hesitant against a potentially more athletic Big 12 squad. After sophomore Brandyn Curry missed a trey, Wright followed with a two-handed put-back slam to give Harvard a 12-10 advantage at 13:25.
Seven minutes later, Wright’s second dunk of the period put the Crimson up 28-17, a lead it would never relinquish in its commanding 82-66 victory.
“I think he’s in much better condition [than last season],” Amaker said. “I think he feels confident attacking the basket like that.
The junior had the play of the game in the second half as he took a pass, spun through two defenders, and finished with a slam. And when he wasn’t attacking, Wright was dishing out assists, taking advantage of the double teams he faced to find his teammates open behind the arc.
“We played hard,” Wright said. “A lot of preparation went into it—practicing hard all week. I think we just did what we were supposed to do.”
Wright’s strong play continued a trend that began when he opened the season with a double-double at George Mason.
Wednesday at Bryant, he was equally as good, coming up big when his team needed him the most.
With Harvard down by four with 1:15 remaining, Wright willed his team to victory, preventing what would have been a major upset at the hands of the Bulldogs.
Coming out of a timeout, the Crimson knew exactly what it wanted to do, hitting its co-captain with a pass in the post.
Wright finished, was fouled, and hit the ensuing free throw, bringing Harvard within one with his three-point play.
On its next possession, the Crimson went right back in to Wright on the left block. But this time, the junior, double-teamed, kicked it out to sophomore Christian Webster and earned the assist on his teammate’s ensuing game-winning three.
“If I see a double, I’m kicking it out,” Wright said. “But I’m just playing hard, just doing what coach tells us to do.”
The junior finished with a career-high 24 points and 10 rebounds against Bryant, his second double-double on the year.
He added three blocks and was solely responsible for keeping the Crimson in the game early on, scoring the first five points of the contest.
“He’s done such a great job this year,” fellow captain Oliver McNally said. “Even games he hasn’t had as many points we build from inside-out. Keith opens up our offense so much.”
Wright’s strong pair of games earned him the Ivy League Player of the Week award, already his second on the young season. The center is second in points (17.2) and rebounds (8.8) in the conference and first in blocks-per-game (2.0) and field goal percentage (.733) thus far.
Capping his week with a home game in which scouts came to watch two of his opponents, Wright was the one who looked like the NBA prospect Sunday afternoon.
“Let’s not carried away,” Amaker said with a smile of Wright’s own draft prospects. “But certainly, Keith has played well, and I’m very pleased with his production.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Any athlete will always remember the last game they played, and for a Harvard football player, going out with The Game provides a particularly memorable backdrop.
For senior Zar Zavala, it would have been hard to top his first three Harvard-Yale weekends, all of which involved rings—championship rings in his freshman and sophomore seasons, and an engagement ring for his now-fiancée, Melanie, last year.
There was no ring to be won this fall. But on top of his class’ perfect 4-0 record against the Bulldogs, Zavala earned a different kind of prize: a Rhodes Scholarship.
“I’m walking down the field, searching for my family,” Zavala says of the moments after the Nov. 20 win. “I’m finding everyone I’ve known for the past four years except for my fiancée. I finally find her, she hands me my phone...and there was a text: ‘Congratulations, you’re a Rhodes Scholar.’”
“The whole team was around me—they were more anxious than I was,” he continues. “I told them yes, and pandemonium broke out. It was insane.”
For the El Paso, Texas native, winning the Rhodes Scholarship represented the culmination of four years of hard work in the classroom.
Zavala is pursuing a joint concentration in engineering and neurobiology and was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa Society earlier this month.
But the accomplishment is even more impressive when you consider the work that Zavala—a wideout who walked onto the team—put in on the gridiron.
During his senior year at Eastwood High School, Zavala endured a pair of surgeries that left him wondering whether it was worth trying to walk on to an Ivy League team, a goal he’d had since middle school.
“I was talking to my mom, and she was like, ‘What do you mean you’re not going to play football anymore? You love football,’” Zavala recalls. “And I was like, ‘Oh, I know, but it will be really hard.’ And she [said], ‘That is not a good enough reason,’...So I started training that summer and slowly got back into shape and then walked on, but it was tough.”
The wideout earned a place on the team as a freshman and will graduate as one of two walk-ons to make it through four years on the team, along with his roommate, defensive tackle Dan Driscoll.
“I think we both agree that the reason that we’re still on the team, and the reason we were able to finish, is because we had each other,” Driscoll says. “It’s a very unique experience to walk on a team, and I’m very grateful to Zar for all the support he’s given me for the last four years. It’s really bonded us.”
Zavala made an immediate impression on the coaching staff for his attitude and work ethic.
“[Right away], you realize just from a character standpoint how tremendous he is,” says wide receiver coach Evan Loring, who has worked with Zavala for the last two seasons. “I didn’t know how good of a football player he was yet at that point, but from the first time I met Zar, I saw something special in the kid.”
Though the senior never found glory on the field with the varsity team—he saw playing time in three games this season, his first varsity appearances—his role in the wide receiving corps, where he spent most of his time on the scout team, was still invaluable.
“We started to learn a lot of new stuff here when I got here,” Loring says. “Zar would pick up the teaching faster than any of the other kids, any of the kids who were better than him physically, who were stronger than him...So all of a sudden, you see Zar out there against [junior cornerback] Matt Hanson, some of the other starters, and he’s using the new technique better than the older guys.”
“It really set an example for the kids who are going to be playing in the Harvard-Yale game and all the big games from the standpoint of seeing it on film first,” he adds.
And for Zavala’s part, he credits football with teaching him some important lessons.
“As a walk-on, you start off significantly behind everybody else, and it’s really embarrassing,” he says. “You get beat, day in and day out, and it’s tiring on your mind, tiring on your body, and that’s all freshman year. So I think the fact that I was able to stick with it and get better enough to where it got fun to be at practice was really the reason why I was able to stay.”
That perseverance helped Zavala navigate a challenging fall in which he had to balance football, work on his senior thesis, and scholarship applications. After being encouraged to consider the Rhodes by both his freshman proctor and his Kirkland tutors, Zavala took their advice and went for it.
“[A tutor] said, ‘You are an ideal candidate. You definitely, definitely owe it to yourself to apply,’” he says. “And throughout the whole process, I was really thinking, ‘I’m not losing at all by applying to this.’ So it was never ‘if I don’t get it, I wasted my time.’ It was always, ‘I’m learning a lot about myself and about how to apply for competitive things throughout it.’”
By the time the football season ended, Zavala had the Rhodes in hand—and was also named a Marshall Scholar, which he turned down.
But the wideout acknowledges that the individual honor was made possible by his team.
“I can’t even describe what it was like,” he says of his teammates’ support. “Everyone knew I was applying...and they knew I was going to get it. They had more faith in me than I did...To hear from them, just constantly, from the coaches and from the players, saying ‘We know you’re going to get it,’ that was extremely important.”
And his teammates were there every step of the way—including in celebration.
“When he found out about the Rhodes, the fact that the kids who were all of our starters and our players wanted to go and run up to him and congratulate him on that achievement—more so than probably even celebrating the win over Yale—was just a testament to how much the kids really love him, how much they care about him and appreciate him on the team,” Loring says.
With the book closed on his football career, Zavala can focus on new adventures—completing his thesis, his June wedding, and the next two years in England, where he plans to study clinical neurology with the ultimate goal of becoming a neurosurgeon.
But even if his name didn’t appear on many stat sheets, Zavala has left a lasting imprint on the Harvard program.
“We’re walk-ons, and it’s not the playing time we’re there for,” Driscoll says. “But I think it’s seeing somebody who is there because he loves football, and not for PT or glory—not that anybody else is. But I’d like to think that the other guys see Zar and see a guy who reminds them of why they play—who’s there because he loves football.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In this special edition of the Full Court Press, the Back Page talks to the Harvard women's lacrosse team, which earned its first victory over Princeton since 1992 in April. Now in the midst of offseason training, the Crimson is working to ensure that its play in the upcoming season is reminiscent of a man-eating alligator. But the laxers took some time to reflect on their love of lattes and their fear of mice. Every week, The Full-Court Press will give you the sort of personal scoop that you’re not likely to hear at a typical press conference.
Stats: The women's lacrosse team ended its 2010 campaign on a winning streak, taking four of its last five games to finish the season with an 8-7 overall mark and a 3-4 showing in conference play. Harvard will open its 2011 season in Palo Alto, Calif., where it will take on Stanford on February 26.
1.Typical pre-game meal.
Latte and a peanut butter sandwich.
2. List four songs your team listens to before games to get pumped up.
"Midd Kid," "Bedrock," "Swing" by Savage, and "Wavin' Flag" by K'naan.
3. Favorite team to play against and why?
This is what we hope we will do to ALL teams this year.
4. Most ridiculous thing that has taken place in your team's locker room.
The mouse we tried to capture which then escaped only to reappear in someone's locker. As for pranks—hiding in a laundry bin or behind snow banks just to scare upperclassmen strolling in. Also buying a fake mouse to relive the above story.
5. Most embarrassing moment on the field.
We fall sometimes...actually quite a bit.
6. Animal that best represents your team's style of play and why.
Cheetah—not quite king of the jungle, but fast, scrappy, hardworking, and pretty.
7. Most ridiculous thing you have heard a fan yell at a game you were playing in.
Unfortunately, we don't get too many fans yelling ridiculous things.
8. If you could play for another sports team at Harvard, which would it be and why?
Squash—it's the most cut throat sport when you think about the attitude to area ratio. Plus, being part of a tradition of champions would be fun.
9. Position you would play in Quidditch.
Beater, it is the most aggressive form of defense ever.
10. If your team could go on a date with any professional athlete, who would it be and where would you take him/her?
We'd take whoever is up to the challenge, and we'd go paintballing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It looks like Gino Gordon’s peers aren’t the only ones who recognize his value. The senior running back followed up his Greely Crocker Award as Harvard football’s MVP this season—an honor voted on by his teammates—with a nomination for the 2010 Asa S. Bushnell Cup, which goes to the Player of the Year in the Ivy League.
Gordon joins three other finalists, all of whom had significant impacts for their respective teams in 2010. Dartmouth junior tailback Nick Schweiger, Penn sophomore quarterback Billy Ragone, and Princeton senior receiver Trey Peacock round out the standout group.
While Gordon has made a habit of shredding his opposition up and down the field for the past three seasons, this award may mark his toughest competition yet. Schweiger set the tone for Ancient Eight backfields this season, racking up a league-leading 1,133 yards on the ground while tying a school record with 14 touchdowns. Schweiger’s 125.9 yards per game were fifth nationally, and the senior showed his versatility by even adding a passing touchdown.
Ragone, meanwhile, may not have topped the stat sheet, but the gritty sophomore made his mark in the win column. The Quaker sophomore led Penn to its second consecutive undefeated Ivy campaign, molding his offense into the highest-scoring unit in the league. Ragone tossed 13 TD’s against just five interceptions and got it done with his legs, finishing fifth in the Ancient Eight with 548 rushing yards—by far the most of any Ivy quarterback.
Peacock was the top receiver in the conference in both receptions (72) and yards (955) but watched his Tigers go winless in the league and just 1-9 overall.
Based on statistics alone, Gordon may not be the favorite for the cup. His 1,059 rushing yards and 105.9 yards per game were both good for second behind Schweiger, although Gordon’s 6.3 yards per carry were tops in the league. But Schweiger’s numbers alone do not tell the full story, nor do Ragone’s wins on a team that boasted one of the best defenses in the FCS. Gordon emerged unquestionably as a leader for the Crimson in 2010, particularly on a team forced to cycle through three different starters at quarterback. The running back did not miss a start his senior season as he closed out a career as the team’s fourth leading rusher all-time with 2,643 yards, and it was this durability and resilience between the tackles that earned Gordon the respect of his teammates.
The winner of the Asa S. Bushnell Cup will be announced on Dec. 6, and if the voters favor numbers, Schweiger or Ragone will almost certainly take home the trophy. But if the award indeed goes to the player who was most valuable to his team, then voters may recognize what Harvard football players already do—no one in the Ivy League was more important to his squad than Gordon.

Tonight, Harvard freshmen had the opportunity to ask University health experts any question they had in mind within the confines of Annenberg dining hall. We thought we’d bring you the information for those of you who missed out. So with a plate of glorious dining hall food, we sat at the experts’ table to ask Barbara Boothby, chief clinical dietician for University Health Services, some tough questions about what HUHDS is feeding us. 
Is a chickwich really chicken?
 
I would say it’s derived from chicken. It’s processed, but it’s a source of protein.
 
How many calories would it add if I put ketchup on my chickwich?
 
A negligible amount.
 
Are these carrots healthy even though they’re covered in a glaze?
 
I don’t know what’s in the glaze, but it doesn’t negate the benefit of nutrition in your carrots. Vitamin A is actually more available in cooked form.
 
Is a wheat roll better for me than a white one?
 
Wheat just designates what plant it comes from. It doesn’t negate wholeness. Wheat suggests healthier, but that’s not a guarantee that it’s all wheat.
 
Does apple pie count as a serving of fruit?
 
Not an entire serving, but a portion of a serving.
Is my meal balanced?
I don’t see any calcium, and you’re low in veggies. From observing eating patterns in students, lunch is a Flyby meal, so students should try to get their servings of vegetables in at dinner. You could use another vegetable, but it’s reasonable.
Fact or fiction: freshman 15? 
 
The number 15 is made up. Most freshmen gain some weight. There are lots of factors that come into play. They are exposed to very different foods, and the environment here is different, with lots of social eating.
What are your opinions on brain break? Is it healthy for students to grab a snack that late?
 
Yes. “No eating after eight” is definitely a myth.
What are some of the healthiest food options in the dining halls? Are there options students overlook?
There’s lots of nutrition in the salad bar, and greens are a good source of protein for vegetarians. Lots of students walk in and go to hot food, and others go to the salad bar. You shouldn’t get stuck in a rut.
 
What is the worst food item available for students in the dining halls?
 
There are some meals that are catered to grab and go. You shouldn’t have three things for lunch that are fried. A couple of meals, you have to look beyond your first instinct for taste.

Since Kirkland House's annual Secret Santa gift exchange commenced on Sunday, residents have been enjoying a dose of holiday cheer.
Throughout the week, mystery Santas give their assigned recipients special treats. Since the grateful recipients do not know the identities of their benefactors, the happy Kirklandites have been sending e-mails over their House list to thank their Secret Santas for their gifts. Since Sunday night, dozens of exuberant e-mails have arrived in Kirkland residents' inboxes.
Culled from those e-mails, here are some of the most unconventional gifts:
· "Three DELICIOUS, EXOTIC FRUITS that the dining hall NEVER serves!"
 ·  A "fluffy, white, antlered baby canine" placed on a student’s pillow
· "Arabic lesson inside a thermos"
· A booty-shaking Santa
· Several puppies and ponies
· George Clooney's face posted to a student's wall
· Breakfast in bed
· Chicken from Wings Over Somerville
· A bottle of Grey Goose Magnum
· A trip to Sky Zone, "a giant room with trampolines"
· Bacon and tea

Christmas is only a month away, and the Harvard College Red Cross wants you start out the season of giving by donating blood this week at its December blood drive.
The drive will take place at Northwest Labs from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. You can sign up to donate or volunteer here. As an added bonus, all donors will receive a Chutney’s coupon.
To encourage you to donate, here are five facts about donating blood that you may not have known:
1.  One pint of blood, the size of a standard donation, can save up to three lives.
2.  The American Red Cross reports that someone needs a blood transfusion every two seconds—that means 38,000 donors are needed every single day.
3.  According to the Mayo Clinic, blood is in higher demand during the summer and holidays. People travel more frequently during these times, putting them at greater risk for accidents.
4.  At least 25 percent of Americans will need a blood transfusion at some point in their lives, the Mayo Clinic estimates.
5.  According to the American Red Cross, “If you began donating blood at age 17 and donated every 56 days until you reached 76, you would have donated 48 gallons of blood, potentially helping save over 1,000 lives!”
