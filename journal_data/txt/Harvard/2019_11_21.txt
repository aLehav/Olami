After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The language of art, creativity, and social change swirled through both conversation and publication at the Cyclorama for the third annual Boston Arts Book Fair. Artists and publishers alike set up booths on Nov. 8 for three days of panel discussions, art installations, workshops, and community, open to the public.
The Boston Arts Book Fair has grown into one of the largest art book fairs on the East Coast since it began in 2017. In its first year the fair housed 60 exhibitors; this year over 130 exhibitors participated in the event. The Boston Center for the Arts and Bodega, an apparel brand, sponsored the fair to facilitate conversations and community among artists and give a public platform for their art. Some artists emphasized self-worth through interactive installations, such as a blind self portrait station where fair visitors drew their faces while staring in a mirror. Others celebrated female artists, black artists, and gender nonconformity or called for prison reform and political activism.
Still, exhibitors centralized the communal impact of art that brought this event together. Kevin Austin Bryant, a Converse employee, initiated a program showcasing the artwork of young artists from Madison Park High School at the fair. He said he valued giving young students the opportunity to engage with the greater Boston art community.
“There are a lot of big publishers, big brands like ours here… for a high school student from Boston, you know, this isn’t really a reality for them, being able to afford a table like this on their own,” Bryant said. “People were asking them to sign the artwork. They were taking [posters] and it gave [the students] a level of realization like, ‘Oh wow! This is what a real artist is like.’”
The students had the opportunity to jump directly into the art world through other exhibitors — such as the Boston Compass, a free, four page monthly art and culture guide — who actively advertised their publications for submissions from new artists at the fair.
“My vision constantly is to get people involved in any way possible,” Kevin Dacey, editor of the Boston Compass, said. “I think people forget that something like this is volunteer-run and we are always looking for people to get involved and help us make it.”
Volunteer-run publications and continual expansion motivated multiple exhibitors, many of whom began as one-person-shows. Several of these artists participated in a panel discussing the challenges of independent publication. Others asked questions to see how they could broaden their art and give new artists the opportunities they had.
“All the work starts with me, Lorenzo, the artist,” Lorenzo Diggins Jr. of Colour Bloc Creativ said. “I think through me sharing my experience, I’m really opening it up to other people to explore.”
Diggins’s publication agglomerates the work of independent artists but began with his art, which he said seeks to prove that “we’re all the same.” Based out of Los Angeles, Diggins and Colour Bloc Creativ mirror the scope of the Boston Art Book Fair, bringing together passionate artists from Boston and across the country.
The Boston Art Review is one example of a local success story. Michaelann Ferro, a motion graphic designer for the Review, spoke to how the Review found its origin at the fair.
“We have a fantastic editor and chief, Jamison Johnson… [who asked] what would they like to see if there was another new publication,” Ferro said. “What she found out is that they wanted a more contemporary art review magazine … and it’s been a labor of love.”
Fair-goer Alejandro C. Eduarte ʼ23 said he appreciated seeing new and upcoming artists. After remarking on the concentration of independent publishers, Eduarte said that the fair has inspired him.
“I think it’s inspired me to look up more of the visual arts stuff that’s happening in the City of Boston,” Eduarte said. “And I think as a student… it’s really cool to know that there’s independent uncategorizable art that some of these publications are doing. So I think it’s really important for students to see some of that work.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you were alive last year, you probably heard “1999” by Charli XCX and Troye Sivan. “I just wanna go back, back to 1999 / take a ride to my old neighborhood,” the pair sings in its chorus, before proceeding to list the many reasons we should want to return to the last year of the second millennium: CDs, MTV, Nike Airs, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, and music from Eminem and Britney Spears.
But should we want to go back? 1999 was a year of good boy bands, big pants, and many Crimson editors’ births, but it was also a year of national anxiety, a year in which the Clinton presidency was coming to an inglorious end and Y2K was looming. Two decades later, it’s time to review the pop culture of 1999.
Music: “I Want It That Way” by The Backstreet Boys
In 1999, the boy band was in, and groups like the Backstreet Boys and NSYNC ruled the charts with their frosted tips and perfect smiles. Today, these groups don’t seem so cute to us, but their music is as fun as ever. 1999 brought us one of the boy band era’s best remembered hits: “I Want It That Way” by the Backstreet Boys.
Almost everyone knows the track’s nonsensical yet supernaturally catchy hook: “I never want to hear you say / I want it that way.” But fewer have seen the song’s music video, which is no less strange and infectious. In its most memorable shot, the Backstreet Boys dance in an airport terminal, wearing all white and periodically fading in and out of existence as a somewhat inexplicable golden glow surrounds them.
Movies: “The Matrix” 
If you time-traveled to a movie theatre in 1999, you’d probably recognize at least one movie playing. “Fight Club,” “Being John Malkovich,” “American Beauty,” “The Blair Witch Project,” and “The Sixth Sense” all came out in 1999. But no 1999 film comes up as often in today’s pop-culture and Philosophy 101 sections as “The Matrix.”
The premise of “The Matrix” is an attention-grabber: A hacker named Neo learns that all humans are asleep, trapped in a simulated reality while hyper-intelligent machines use them as batteries. Beyond its thought-provoking premise, the cultural impact of the matrix has been immense. The film turned Keanu Reeves into a superstar, popularized the genre of cyberpunk, and brought an approach to fight scenes common in Japanese animation and martial arts films to the American mainstream.
TV: “The Sopranos”
On January 10, 1999, a show premiered that would soon claim an obligatory spot near the top of any TV critic’s best-series-of-all-time list. This show would draw condemnation from Italian-American groups, ignite interest in the genre of prestige television, and forever change the experience of driving on the New Jersey Turnpike with its iconic tile sequence. This show, of course, is “The Sopranos.”
“The Sopranos” tells the story of Tony Soprano and his many tumultuous relationships, both in his literal family and the DiMeo crime family of which he is the boss. This is a story that would have been easy to tell through stereotypes: Tony could have been a gangster first, a cigar-smoking don clipped out of a ’40s gangster movie. Instead, showrunner David Chase chose to make him a human first — Tony has human problems, and his therapy sessions structure much of the series’s plot. “The Sopranos” is not a perfect TV show, but its embrace of complexity paved the way for 21st-century classics like “Mad Men” and “Breaking Bad.”
The pop culture of 1999 had its duds, but overall, our memory of it is overwhelmingly positive. This list excludes so many iconic 1999 moments, like the release of “All Star” by Smash Mouth, the premiere of “Fight Club,” and the airing of the first episodes of “The West Wing” and “Spongebob Squarepants.” We like some of these cultural artifacts sincerely, and some ironically. But nevertheless, we like them all.
Our nostalgia for 1999 — and the ‘90s in general — may have something to do with demographics. People in their 20s decide what’s cool, what’s in, and what’s out, and in 2019, those people were born in the early ‘90s. The pop culture of 1999 was their childhood. It should come as no surprise that we see some of our current trends reflected in it.

When students call upon “Harvard” to take charge and be responsible for its morally questionable financial decisions, we often take the larger institution itself to be some kind of weighty moral agent that solely ought to shoulder the moral blame.
On billionaire financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey E. Epstein’s significant monetary contributions to the University, for instance, The Crimson Editorial Board opined that “Harvard must take meaningful action to demonstrate…that it recognizes the role the University played in [Epstein’s] legitimation.” In a University–wide email about the donations, University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote: “I profoundly regret Harvard’s past association with him.” Likewise, advocates of divestment raise the contention that “Harvard retaining its investments in the fossil fuel industry…is a form of completely unethical and unsustainable action” and that “Harvard enriches and is enriched by a [prison-industrial] system that keeps 2.3 million souls in shackles and millions more under surveillance.”
By placing the crux of moral burden solely on the greater “persona ficta” that is Harvard, we neglect a crucial moral question: What are our own individual moral duties and obligations that arise qua our status as spenders of the monies that Harvard receives?
As an institution that spans 12 schools, educates 36,012 students, hires 18,000 staff, and boasts 371,000 living alumni, it is hard to claim that any single affiliate of this colossal and organizationally complex institution should bear responsibility for the decisions of the University. Consequently, when students discuss issues that concern the University, we often implicitly assume that Harvard acts separately from us.
This careless depersonalization — and the diffusion of individual responsibility that follows it — is natural. In fact, even Bacow has acknowledged that Harvard’s “decentralization” makes it difficult to review the University’s ties with Epstein. And if the University’s president cannot — understandably — be cognizant of the institution’s connections with Epstein, it is plausible that we often fall into a similar trap of analyzing Harvard’s decisions from a par away from ourselves, as if we are distantly situated from its decision-making. As a result, when The Crimson Editorial Board addresses issues like the gentrification of Allston or the pressure facing immigrant students, it often calls upon “Harvard” — an arcane, abstract, anthropomorphized personality — to respond promptly and morally, not ourselves.
Especially with regards to the ethical discourse surrounding Harvard’s sourcing of money, this depersonalisation is untenable. As members of the Harvard community, our nexus of connection to Harvard’s immoral sources of funding — which have spanned, past and present, a wide gamut of donations from convicted sex offender Epstein, employment and company investments in the fossil fuel industry and related investments to the prison-industrial complex, companies involved in the South African apartheid regime, the tobacco industry which has targeted vulnerable youth and countries, the Sackler family which has profited from the nation’s opioid crisis — is the evident, resounding fact that we are the designated and eventual spenders of this money. The abstract issue of corporate moral agency trickles down to us.
“Harvard” itself does not enjoy the accommodations of newly renovated dorms that have cost over $873.9 million, nor does it receive any of the million-dollar compensations for University administrators. The revenue that Harvard gains, both from donations and investment returns, eventually benefits us — students, researchers, and faculty members. As complicit spenders and direct beneficiaries of Harvard’s often immorally-sourced endowment, we should hold ourselves individually accountable in questioning where our resources come from and where our resources are (not) going towards, and more importantly, in understanding the moral implications of what spending this money means.
If we truly believe that “Harvard” should steer clear of unethical financing, we should also demand a reciprocal duty from ourselves. We should consider how often we tend to sidestep the hard moral considerations that fall upon us all, individually, as students, faculty, and affiliates. We must not forget our own involvements in this grander structure that is Harvard. And no matter who is at fault or to blame, we should work together towards improving our community and upholding a kind of forward-looking, collective, reparative responsibility.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I told myself I wouldn’t tell my kids these stories. And yet, posted today to the immutable internet, here are the stories of how my roommates and I ended up having Thanksgiving dinner at a Chinese takeout restaurant, and how we went without food and shelter in the mountains of rural China — two separate stories, of course.
It was my very first Thanksgiving away from home. Instead of family and my aunt’s savory turkey, it was my roommates and a d-hall Thanksgiving meal — I was stuck in Boston for the weekend. But the worst part of that dinner was missing it entirely: we misread the emails and showed up too late. And by the time we made the bold move to have Thanksgiving dinner at the Hong Kong, a formidably fast fast-food takeout joint, I was in an Uber, racing to the suburbs of Boston to pick up my shift as a server for an affluent family’s Thanksgiving. I missed Thanksgiving dinner back home, at Harvard, and even at the Kong. My Thanksgiving dinner at 10 p.m. consisted of a handful of breath mints and half a family-sized bag of Funyuns.
We continued to make the best of this odd Thanksgiving. After feeding a floormate’s pet fish in their common room, we decided to overstay our visit and watch a movie on their TV. You know it's been an odd Thanksgiving when you fall asleep on the bed of a near-stranger, platonically cuddling with your best friend for warmth as he confides in you about a recent breakup.
There was something wrong with every part of that night. But we found a way to have unforgettable Thanksgiving, and it didn’t cost a dime. I wasn’t able to put it into words, but I knew I craved for more experiences like that night.
Two years later, in the mountains of rural China, that feeling resurfaced. Allow me to paint the picture.
Six college students, two parts brave and 98 parts dumb, spend a summer night in the Huangshan mountains, with no hotel, hostel, or even a tent prepared in advance. Armed with one meatstick per person and a singular loaf of bread, they find a clearing in the forest and try to sleep on a stone slab by a cliff. As temperatures drop, temperaments rise, and one sleepless traveler nearly runs off the edge of the cliff in hysteria. They move camp and break into an abandoned shack for some shuteye. Two hours later, stomachs rumbling, eyes sunken, they summit the mountain to witness a beautiful East Asian sunrise. Of course, they promptly pay the price with a hungry 14 kilometer trek back down to civilization.
I’m often in disbelief that I am of the (un)lucky six who experienced Huangshan this way. I used to be a huge control freak: it was once anxiety-inducing to not know where I was, where I was headed, and why I was headed there. It took experiences like my freshman Thanksgiving and Huangshan — experiences where my control was heavily limited by the environment — for me to be comfortable giving up control.
Investor and author Tim Ferriss argues that a great way to judge situations of high uncertainty is through fear-setting: playing out precisely what the worst-case scenario looks like. An untraditional Thanksgiving wouldn’t destroy my social connection with my family. A night out in the mountains would probably get me sick, but the path to recovery is clear. It was by realizing that the worst case scenario was not so bad that the experience became de-risked, leaving me happy to give up control.
As the YouTube group Yes Theory often discusses, there is one primary question we need to ask more often: What makes you uncomfortable? They contend that most personal growth occurs by deliberately venturing outside your comfort zone. By accepting a loss of control and leaving it to fate, or God, or quantum randomness — whatever name fits you — I found a lot of peace in being unprepared. Before, this statement would have shaken me to my core, but now I’m actively working on honing my ability to take on the grey areas with a new calmness.
Maybe it didn’t have to take a near deadly overnight hike in China or even a soiled Thanksgiving to discover the rush in pursuit of seeking discomfort. Still, I take away the value of keeping a high spirit in embracing the ugly uncertainty of life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this month, the Harvard Alumni Association, in partnership with the First Generation Harvard Alumni shared interest group, released an inaugural non-class “class report,” offering reflections from first-generation alumni. The volume, formed in the style of the traditional Red Books issued to each graduating class once every five years, was unveiled at a Harvard Alumni Association ceremony to both contributing alumni and current first-generation students.
We believe this publication is an important initiative by the Harvard Alumni Association to elevate the stories of traditionally underrepresented students on campus, containing helpful advice for current students, particularly on topics unique to the first-generation experience. This is a much-needed resource for those who are learning to adjust and adapt to Harvard — those who might benefit from advice on navigating a complicated and often intimidating new environment.
There is incredible value in introducing first-generation students to the wealth of knowledge that alumni have accumulated, as well as providing the beginning tools for how to network with people with whom they may have shared experiences. We do not see this book as a homogenous collection of experiences reflecting one particular way of being at Harvard, and we hope that it will not define students by their first-generation identity. Rather, we hope they will convey a variety of experiences that might resonate with current students, exposing them to the full range of possibilities their futures might hold and giving them a sense of the tools at their disposal.
The tangible nature of this project provides yet another impactful statement — relating the permanence and investment that the University has made and will continue to make for students of first-generation backgrounds. Rather than a webpage or an electronic document, the volume’s printed nature gives it greater material significance. This unique Red Book is an encouraging attempt to institutionalize the telling of first-generation stories and their incorporation into the idea of the Harvard experience.
Moving forward, the advice contained in these volumes might best be delivered and received at the beginning of students’ paths at Harvard. Making this book accessible to freshmen when they first matriculate is a key part of using it not only as a storytelling tool, but as a genuine source of advice.
We would love to see this initiative expand to other interest groups, identities, and aspects of student life. Being a first-generation student is just one among the many challenges faced by students through their time here — challenges that begin well before students step onto campus, and that sometimes continue long after they have left. Receiving alumni guidance on how various aspects of the Harvard experience have forged, affected, and influenced their identities can only serve to help students, current and future. We applaud this, not as a solution but an important first step in greater access and inclusion. This book will not level the playing field, but it gives first-generation and low-income students a playbook from which to start their journey.
This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board. It is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings. In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.

Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said he hopes the athletics review — which Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay announced earlier this semester — will center around improving student-athletes’ health and wellness.
He noted that Mercer — the outside firm Harvard tapped to lead the search — will conduct a “multi-method” review to gather a wide variety of feedback from student-athletes and Athletics staff. The review, chaired by Khurana and top administrators including Gay and Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise, is currently underway and will examine the department’s culture and structure.
“The hope is that through those different methods, especially those that focus on the student-athlete experience, will allow us to both identify those issues, to give clarity and definition to them, and the contours of them, to understand where are areas that we need to improve,” Khurana said. “I think that's why for me, it's quite important that the student-athlete experience and their health and wellbeing really be the sort of guiding star for us around that.”
Harvard launched the review earlier this year following a tumultuous period for athletics on campus and nationwide. In March, federal authorities revealed a scheme in which parents of college applicants bribed coaches at elite universities like Yale and Stanford to recommend their children for admission as athletic recruits. Harvard was not directly implicated in the scandal.
Soon after the admissions scandal broke, the Boston Globe reported that Jie Zhao — the parent of two current and former Harvard fencers — bought former head fencing coach Peter Brand’s Needham, Mass. home for hundreds of thousands of dollars above its assessed value. After examining the matter, Harvard dismissed Brand. The case is now the subject of a federal grand jury probe.
In an interview last month, Gay said the athletics review is unrelated to Brand’s case. She and Khurana both cited the 2026 anniversary of the naming of the first Athletics director as the driving force for the review.
Still, Khurana said the review will reaffirm the department’s values in a period of turmoil for athletics nationally.
“Recognizing the context is constantly changing for college athletics in the national discourse, how do we stay true to our Ivy League values that literally gave definition to what the Ivy League is?” he said. “The Ivy League is an athletic conference, not, sort of, schools that have ivy — like the plant.”

The David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies cancelled its January program in Chile due to ongoing protests in the country, according to the center’s website.
Since 2003, the DRCLAS program has sent 15 college students during winter break to work alongside Chilean students from a local university, Universidad Mayor, in a rural, indigenous region outside of the capital Santiago. Those undergraduates volunteer in several fields, including medicine, education, and agriculture.
Chile has been roiled by demonstrations since October, when students began protesting a price raise in the subway system. The protests have evolved to focus on an expansive range of social issues, with protestors claiming a high cost of living, rampant inequality, and various infrastructure issues. In late October, approximately 1 million Chileans joined demonstrations in Santiago that have yet to cease.
Several students who participated in the program in past years said they are disappointed that others will not have the chance to go this year.
Annie Miall ’22, who attended the program in Jan. 2019, said she enjoyed the experience she had in Chile because it provided her a new outlook on medicine.
“I am really sad to hear that the program is cancelled because it was one of my favorite trips I have taken at Harvard,” Miall said. “And it really changed my perspective on what it means to be a physician.”
However, given the political unrest in Santiago, she said she sees the cancellation as a prudent decision.
“It is probably best, due to the political instability in Chile right now, for students not to partake just for this year,” Miall said. “But I think in future years, I really hope that it is not cancelled so that more people can get to enjoy and learn from that experience.”
The program's facilitators said they were similarly disappointed. Pilo Mella, the program manager for the Chile trip, noted that the current instability would complicate organizing the trip properly — one of the main reasons for its cancelation. She added that Universidad Mayor ultimately made the decision to cancel the trip.
“Their decision is not unreasonable given that the coordination required to organize the program takes several weeks,” Mella said. “I understand why they canceled the program but it’s unfortunate…the decision was based on the uncertainty we are still living in in Chile.”
Despite this year’s cancellation, Mella pointed out the learning opportunity that studying in Chile will present to students in the future. As of now, the decision to cancel the January trip only applies to this year's program.
“This is a great opportunity for future students to come, to study and understand the social protests, the demands of the people and the proposed changes to the constitution and public policies and also how human rights violations have been handled here in Chile,” she said. ​​​​

With fewer than two weeks until the deadline Harvard’s graduate student union has set to go on strike, both the University and the union's bargaining committee have publicly released their contract proposals.
Earlier this week, Harvard released all of its proposals on a website devoted to the union negotiations. Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers released a selection of provisions on Wednesday related to compensation, health benefits, and grievance procedure for sexual harassment and discrimination complaints. These three issues represent the core disagreements at the heart of the impending strike.
While both sides have offered some insights into their proposals over the past year of negotiations, this week’s releases provide unprecedented detail on the most controversial contract provisions. They also demonstrate how far apart the two sides remain on these three issues.
Based on the proposals, conflict over the two sides’ approaches to adjudicating sexual harassment and discrimination complaints appears to have no end in sight. The union has continued to insist that its members be allowed to use a grievance procedure separate from Harvard’s current Title IX processes, and one that could lead to a third-party arbitration. The University, however, has maintained that these complaints be handled through its existing offices, arguing that there might be legal barriers to adopting the union’s proposal.
“We cannot have two different procedures on campus, I think, for dealing with Title IX complaints, depending upon a student's status in a particular moment in time,” University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an interview earlier this month.
The two sides also remain at an impasse over compensation.
The union’s compensation proposals include yearly salary increases substantially higher than those the University has offered. HGSU’s proposal would bring a salary and stipend increases of six to seven percent per year. The University’s proposal, by contrast, would bring a seven to eight percent wage increase over the next three years.
The two parties’ proposed minimum wages also vary substantially.
The University offered a minimum wage for hourly teaching staff and research assistants of $17 and $15, respectively, with annual raises. The union proposed a minimum wage for all hourly student workers ranging from $28 to $34, depending on academic discipline — nearly double the annual increase in the University's proposal.
In addition to significant differences in compensation, the two sides also vary widely on their healthcare benefits proposals.
All salaried or stipended student workers and hourly student workers working more than 90 hours per semester or summer term — an average of roughly seven hours per week — are eligible for benefits under HGSU’s proposal. Their dependents would also enjoy the same benefits.
Under the union proposal, the University would be required to provide physical, mental, dental, and vision care as well as prescription drugs with “no premiums or fees” to eligible student workers. This would include all in-network mental health specialist visits, medically-approved in-network specialist visits exceeding $35, and gender affirmation medical treatments.
The University’s healthcare proposals include an annual $275,000 health insurance premium support fund, $275,000 child care support fund, $85,000 dental health plan support fund to be distributed at the union’s discretion among its members.
The University also proposed a 2 percent increase in both 2020 and 2021 for its existing Parental Accommodation and Financial Support program, which currently provides Ph.D. students in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences a one-time stipend of $6,624 for newly born or adopted children and up to 12 weeks of family leave.
In an email to union members Wednesday, HGSU bargaining committee member Cole M. Meisenhelder wrote that the union will deliver “solidarity letters” to Bacow at his office in Massachusetts Hall Friday, half an hour before negotiators convene for another bargaining session.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences is now giving faculty “mandatory training packets” on grant proposal disclosure responsibilities and will recommit to enforcing a rule that faculty submit their grant proposals early, Dean of Science Christopher W. Stubbs said in a Tuesday interview.
The changes come as the National Institutes of Health investigates potential intellectual theft at more than 70 American universities. The NIH has already reached out to Harvard about inconsistencies in grant proposals in the past academic year, according to Stubbs.
“Disclosure of effort and disclosure of intellectual entanglements is the key thing from a faculty perspective,” he said.
Harvard has also formed two committees to review and strengthen current guidelines for faculty research, specifically related to federal grants. Stubbs first announced the creation of the committees earlier this month at a faculty meeting.
A University-wide body — assembled by the Provost’s office — will review potentially sensitive research collaborations, like those on a federally maintained list of “suboptimal” overseas organizations, according to Stubbs.
A second committee — specific to FAS and organized by FAS Dean Claudine Gay — will ensure “tactical grant complicance” among its constituents, he added.
Stubbs said he and Gay “mobilized” themselves last fall to clearly delineate the relationships between scientists, funding agencies, and the University against the “background of an evolving geopolitical context.”
In addition to distributing the training packets on disclosure responsibilities, FAS will now “thoroughly enforce” a rule that faculty members submit proposals five days before the agency submission deadline to make sure that “all the boxes are checked,” Stubbs said.
The New York Times reported earlier this month that nearly all of the incidents the NIH and FBI are reviewing involve Chinese and Chinese American researchers allegedly stealing information for the Chinese government. The probe has already led to concerns that Chinese researchers are facing discriminatory targeting, the Times noted.
Stubbs said Tuesday that he would seek to prevent the perception of unfair treatment at Harvard.
“We firmly stand behind the basic principle that in no instance should any member of our community feel any sense of discrimination for any reason whatsoever be it national origin, religion, political persuasion, or other,” he said.
Stubbs said he is also concerned by an “emerging idea in the government” that there exists an area of “sensitive” research between classified work and open scholarship. He suggested quantum computing — which has the potential to break encryption — as an example of one such area.
“So the government would like to exercise some kind of control over that domain of scholarship — and like, well, we don't want foreigners in your lab if you work on that,” Stubbs said. “I would personally like for Harvard to stand firmly behind the idea that there's classified and there’s unclassified, and don't come and tell us that there's this fuzzy stuff in between.”
He said he hopes the University-wide body would “push back” on the government if they attempt to reify this new category of “sensitive, but unclassified” research.
“I think the interesting part of it is standing firmly behind principles of academic freedom and free flow of scholars and ideas — and at the same time recognizing that, as a nonprofit institution, that is supported both directly and implicitly by the taxpayers in this nation, we do have an obligation to protect the national security interests of the country,” he said.
In an incident separate from the ongoing NIH probes, Harvard has recently had to take action against a faculty member for inconsistencies in their disclosure record, according to Stubbs.
“I dealt with one instance of an individual who had a very complicated appointment at Harvard, and whose repertoire of activity wasn't consistent with our expectations,” he said. “And I terminated that individual’s appointment at Harvard.
Stubbs did not name the faculty member. Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to provide it after the interview.
“Harvard does not comment on personnel issues,” she wrote in an email.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though Harvard first announced its sanctions policy three years ago, the College has not yet decided whether to subject some student groups — including House Committees — to the penalties.
Associate Dean of Student Engagement Alexander R. Miller said in an interview Tuesday that the Dean of Students Office has only been “clear” about the sanctions’ effects on student organization leaders and pre-orientation program leaders.
The sanctions — which took effect with the Class of 2021 — prohibit members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from captaining varsity athletic teams, holding leadership positions in campus student organizations, and receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships.
Miller said Tuesday that the College has “not had a conversation” about whether the sanctions apply to House Committee chairs and that the issue is “not on [his] radar.”
“On first impulse, House Committees are elected by the house communities,” Associate Dean of Students Lauren E. Brandt ’01 said Tuesday. “So I think there's that piece of the process, that we want to be careful about in terms of this.”
Many student organizations that are subject to the sanctions elect their leaders.
DSO administrators confirmed Tuesday that Peer Advising Fellows and pre-orientation program leaders are not subject to the sanctions. But the policy does apply to pre-orientation directors — like members of the Freshman Outdoor Program steering committee — and Eagle PAFs, who serve as student leaders of the PAF program.
PAFs are upperclassmen chosen by the College to advise freshmen. Similarly, pre-orientation program leaders guide freshmen during the week leading up to move-in day.
Kate Colleran, who serves as assistant dean of student engagement and leadership in the DSO, wrote in an emailed statement that the guidelines for pre-orientation programs is consistent with the rest of the sanctions policy, and that administrators and students are aware of these guidelines.
“Having sanctions apply only to the steering committees of the Pre-Orientation programs is in line with the practice for all other student organizations regarding sanctions. (With ISOs, for example, it would be officers or executive board as detailed in the groups' constitutions.) The Pre-O directors have been informed of this and will be working within their groups to be in line with the policy,” Colleran wrote.
Miller said Tuesday that students should consult administrative bodies like the Office of Undergraduate Education if they have questions about whether the social group penalties apply to a specific program.
“I would invite them to go to their supervisors who manage them on a regular basis to figure out because these are expectations that should be communicated as part of their employment,” Miller said.

While Harvard students have many strengths, understanding football is not one of them. As Harvard-Yale — the one football game Harvard students attend — approaches, a guide to watching and understanding the sport is necessary to make sure we don’t embarrass ourselves (and end up being ridiculed on SportsCenter). So here are a few basic things we should all know.
Offense vs. Defense
This is really basic, but on offense we are trying to score, and on defense we are trying to stop them from scoring. You can tell what we are currently doing by paying close attention (unlikely, but an effective method), or just by looking at the scoreboard. Whoever has the lit up ball next to their name is on offense.
Positions
Offensive positions to know:
The quarterback: throws or hands off the ball and tells everyone else what they should be doing.
The wide receivers catch the ball the quarterback throws.
The running backs get handed the ball and run it towards the end zone (where we need to go to score a touchdown).
Defensive positions to know:
It’s not important that you know any names, since defenders are all just trying to tackle
people as quickly as possible.
Points
Touchdown: A player on the offensive team puts the ball in the end zone — six points.
Kick (Point After Touchdown): After a touchdown, the kicker can kick the ball through the big yellow posts — one point.
Two-Point Conversion: After a touchdown, the team that just scored can choose to run/throw the ball into the end zone — two points.
Field Goal: when a team kicks in between the yellow posts, not after a touchdown — three points.
Safety: when the ball carrier is tackled in their own end zone — two points (unlikely to happen though).
Downs (Structure of the Game)
The offensive team has four downs (tries) to move 10 yards. Everytime they move 10 or more yards, they reset to a first down (cheer when this happens!). After the fourth down (last try), possession of the ball is given to the other team wherever on the field the ball sits. So, on fourth down, the offensive team will usually punt (kick) the ball away to move the other team farther from the end zone. This means third down is the most important one, so you should cheer loudly if the other team has a long way to go on third down.
Penalties
If you see a yellow flag on the field, someone did something wrong. Listen to the referee to see who it was and who is being punished.
Timing
One football minute does not equal one real life minute — in fact, it’s not even close. The game is going to take a while, so enjoy yourself. Maybe try to figure out what is going on with Harvard’s band as a side activity.
If you know all of this, you should be able to follow the game enough to avoid embarrassing yourself. If you get confused, just watch the cheerleaders, who are sober and paying attention to what’s going on, not to mention incredibly entertaining. And remember, we want the most points (this isn’t golf) so we can storm the field at the end of the game.
