After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s beginning to look like the Fates had it in for Greece. Of all the eurozone countries, it has been hit hardest by the global recession. Even as the rest of the world begins to recover from the recent financial crisis, interest rates on Greek debt have skyrocketed. While the government continues to spend liberally, investors have lost faith that the country will emerge from its economic doldrums.
As Greece and the European Union rush to stop the Greek problem from spilling over into the rest of the EU, we urge them to take heed of popular sentiment and not shore up Greek debt with taxpayer money from Germany and France—the only two eurozone economies in a position to help. Doing so would constitute forcing a stronger political union on eurozone and, more broadly, EU member-countries where such a union does not exist and is not wanted by their citizens.
What may seem like a rather isolated problem is really much more. Ever since the EU, with Germany at the helm, ushered in the Euro in 1999 (some say hastily), the fiscal collapse of any one eurozone country has had the potential to erase confidence in the common currency that underpins the economic structure of them all. A catastrophic loss of faith in the Euro, a currency second only to the United States Dollar in importance, would have grievous ramifications worldwide.
As such, the question to ask is not whether Greece ought to receive economic support, but rather from where it should be coming. Interpreting EU treaties in such a way that allows rich member-countries to bail out poorer ones is a step toward integrated eurozone fiscal policy as it necessitates the coercion of the poorer countries’ fiscal policymakers. Although austere German inflation-hawks might disagree, any interventionist French politician-turned-economist would gladly proclaim that fiscal policy is inherently, and rightly, subject to political forces. Indeed, in that country, unlike in Germany and the U.S., elected politicians dictate what federal rate-setters ought to prioritize.
It is precisely because such marked differences in sentiment would have to be overcome that even bailing out Greece (or any other eurozone member) with eurozone money would be more than just the small step toward centralized fiscal policy that it may appear to be. It would also be a very large step toward political union—a goal that the EU must not reach too far for until it attains the approval to do so from the popular ballot on which its authority rests.
The obvious source of emergency funds, then, is the International Monetary Fund. Not only is it one of the only institutions with enough money (over $750 billion in lending capacity) to sustainably prop up the Greek economy, but the fund also has unmatched experience in setting troubled economies straight—that, after all, is its purpose. While it is unprecedented for the IMF to bail out a eurozone nation, it has bailed out several EU members including the United Kingdom in 1976 and, more recently, Hungary, Latvia, and Romania in cooperation with the EU.
Undoubtedly, there is a stigma that is attendant to being bailed out by the IMF, which most often works with developing nations that are facing severe economic problems. However, Greece and the EU must not be so proud as to turn up their nose at the only realistic alternative that does not entirely sacrifice Greek sovereignty or reach beyond the limited powers granted the EU. Giving Greece this slap on the wrist for its economic mismanagement would also encourage other troubled eurozone economies that may be counting on the cushion of Franco-German bailout to finally institute meaningful fiscal and economic reforms of their own.
Currently, the IMF is largely sitting on the sidelines in an advisory role to Athens as France and Germany seek a European solution to what they think of as a European problem. But, as the pitfalls of a Greek collapse would extend far beyond EU borders, European leaders should be more open to the idea of an IMF-directed bailout than they currently are.
European voters have not authorized the EU to become an integrated political union that can determine a common fiscal policy for eurozone members. As such, it should not be in the power of European leaders to extract from EU treaties the ability to do so; rather, they should allow the IMF to lead the charge as it is an institution designed to do just that. Difficult as it may be, the EU must ensure that whatever steps it takes toward stronger economic union are not yet dependent on strengthening its political one.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A picture is worth a thousand words—and a few thousand worthless ones. An article in The New York Times titled “A Desolate Princess of the Bronx? Not Then, Not Now” provides evidence of how easy it is to misinterpret an image. The iconic picture published on Halloween 1991 that showed then-six-year-old Guissette Muniz standing alone amidst a scene of urban poverty provoked readers of the newspaper to contact the family offering gifts or expenses-paid travel opportunities—yet Muniz herself never felt impoverished. With two employed parents and a supportive neighborhood community, the Muniz family lived “ok” Mr. Muniz says. It may not have been a cushy life, but it was a far cry from the sense of destitution the picture suggests.
The ease with which we misread not just pictures but conversations, people, events, and other things that occur in day-to-day life shows us how quick we are to make assumptions. Like in the case of the Guissette Muniz photograph, a girl on an empty street is immediately interpreted negatively because we project our impression of poverty onto what we see before us. We have a compulsion to categorize everything that we come into contact with into neatly drawn boxes—even though all our experiences of life point us to the contrary. Life doesn’t fit into boxes or categories—it is wild and chaotic and personal. Why, then, do we instinctively slap a label on everything we encounter?
Evolutionarily speaking, it may have been a helpful survival tactic to be able to interpret events speedily so that we are not caught under the foot of a mammoth as we try to understand why it is blundering our way in a fit of rage. Supposedly, in an age when we receive pieces of information at an increasingly rapid pace, we should be getting even better at interpreting them. We are constantly being updated by smartphone, blog, or websites that update in real time. This trend extends beyond Twitter or Facebook—The New York Times website is also updated before the next issue is in print. But this bulk of information, instead of providing us with a more holistic view of the world, is really just allowing us to misinterpret the wealth of information we have access to. It is firing too much at us, too fast. It’s very hard not to choke if you’re drinking from a fire hose.
This is not only true for news, but for our personal interactions as well. Scientists have shown that only a thin sliver of our communication occurs through spoken word. The majority of it is attributed to body language and other things such as tone of voice. Yet none of these things is expressed when you send a text message, write on your friend’s wall, or shoot an e-mail—and still we are so reliant on such forms of communication to maintain our relationships with the people in our lives.
Where once we were afforded lag time to process all that we hear and see, life and its fast pace now facilitate our misjudgments. Although it is easy to make assumptions and then move on as life speeds past on a jet stream, an awareness of our tendencies and a brief pause before we categorize could make the difference between a desolate child and a family’s little princess.

Guilt settles in quickly, but still not fast enough to quench that awful first reaction—“Again?”
It’s late afternoon and the kettle’s bubbling for coffee as I read online that there’s been another natural disaster, an earthquake, this time in Chile. The website has a slideshow—mangled cars, split buildings, efficient foreigners ferrying in aid. As always, there’s a sense of arriving late; the disaster’s already happened, the Red Cross is already there, and stringers have had time to send in not only a first report but two or three updates. All the same, it is horrifying. And so that initial thought spasm—“God, not another one”—is accompanied by an entrenched sense of remorse. Thinking of it as “just another disaster” discredits the horror of this particular event, an 8.8 magnitude shock that’s left hundreds dead and millions displaced.
Such an impulse, I know, didn’t emerge from thin air. Students of the apocalypse, disappointed in the failure of July 1999 to carry out Nostradamus’s prediction (a great “King of Terror” was supposed to descend from the sky to restore Genghis Khan) will find ample substance for speculation in the recent string of natural disasters—Sri Lanka in 2004, New Orleans in 2005, Sichuan in 2008, Haiti just under two months ago. Coming so close together, they become easy to blur into symbols of something larger—or worse, to ignore. It reminds me of what V.S. Naipaul wrote when he returned to India after several decades and saw families in dirt and rags in the street: “Two generations separated me from that kind of poverty; but I felt closer to it than most of the Indians I met.” See it enough, and you simply cease to see.
No matter how difficult, it’s essential to consider each disaster individually, resisting the urge to run it into a trend line. Submerging it in some larger structure only discourages real compassion and action—and in moments of disaster, it’s action that’s needed more than anything.
Unfortunately, the way in which disasters are reported often encourages precisely the opposite reaction. I first read about the Chile quake on the New York Times website, where beside the images, an op-ed by Al Gore admonished that “We Can’t Wish Away Climate Change”—the title assuming a generalizing reaction like the one I’d worked so hard to overcome. Below, another link plumbed voyeuristically for more information: “Are you in an affected area? What are you seeing?” and requested that readers send in “pix.” Where the Olympics slideshow had been the day before, and would be the next day, disaster images moved by in matter-of-fact procession. All of it was impressively slick—disconcertingly so. Chile could have been replaced by any other country, and nothing would have changed.
One effective means of particularizing, for instance, is through photography—once you’ve seen those images of mass graves in Haiti, it’s impossible to forget them. But rather than suffering Chileans, most of the photos on the New York Times front were of industrious and healthy-looking aid workers. Far from being desensitized, we’re hardly shown scenes of death at all.
Part of this is that in our culture any real depiction of death is taboo. Julian Barnes writes of “lemon tables” in China at which dinner guests are not only permitted but expected to speak freely of death. In many cultures, corpses are tenderly washed and wrapped in shrouds by members of the family. Modern hospitals and undertakers, in contrast, make contact with the dead virtually nonexistent—when Woody Allen jokes about the Grim Reaper, it’s practically avant-garde.
At times, certainly, the arts pages do attempt to humanize the dead of the affected country, publishing excerpts from the national literature or inviting its authors to set down their feelings in print. (Only when the country is non-western, of course: if an earthquake hit France, we’d hardly be treated to the “unknown” works of Stendhal. As it happens, most of the recent disaster-stricken areas have also been poor ones.) This was what happened after Haiti, such as with Edwidge Danticat’s moving piece about her dead relatives in The New Yorker.
There’s nothing wrong with keeping home in mind, of course. On the coffee table here I keep a copy of the Times Literary Supplement. With a cover reading “Golden California,” its bright orange-gold sky often comes as great comfort in a country where dribbling rain means a good weather day. If an earthquake ever hits the Bay Area’s San Andreas Fault Line like it did in 1989, part of the process of coping would likely involve writing something out.
But as well-intentioned as they are, all of the slideshows, finger-wagging articles, and delicate stories from famous authors simply sanitize the disaster and transform it into a fait accompli. Danticat’s description is not necessarily a pleasant read, but the way she tells it makes tragedy seem almost beautiful—lilting, and very far away, beyond the reach of human hands. What we need to see instead is actual blood, and pain, and suffering, and then—maybe—it will all seem real. For now, rationalizing Chile and Haiti into mere plot points only compounds the tragedy as, in those God-fearing countries, divine fury cracks the earth.

To the editors:
We are writing in response to a recent Crimson editorial regarding remarks made by Martin Kramer, Visiting Fellow at Harvard’s Weatherhead Center for International Affairs (“Weatherheading the Storm,” The Crimson Staff, Feb. 24, 2010). Kramer advocated that aid to the population of Gaza be cut in order to curb birthrates and “crack the culture of martyrdom which demands a constant supply of superfluous young men.”
Such statements are at odds with fundamental respect for human life and dignity. They reflect a very disturbing larger trend in the debate about the Middle East—the dangerous dehumanizing of “the other side”—which, rather then leading us toward a long-term solution and lasting peace, further deepens the conflict. As Jews, mindful of our long history of persecution and discrimination, we ought to be particularly vigilant when the value of the lives of another group is called into question.
We strongly believe that reducing extremism and truly pursuing a peaceful solution for the Middle East requires working toward full political, economic, and human rights for all Israelis and Palestinians. This will also provide hope for a constructive future to the young people in Gaza—the best remedy against extremism. It is both a stragetic interest for the long term stability and security for Israel and a moral imperative resulting from our Jewish and human values.
We therefore call on Mr. Kramer and all other members of the Harvard community to respect the human dignity of all. No human being is superfluous.

To the editors:
The Dec. 14th opinion piece “Make Like a Democrat,” cites a figure of 47 million uninsured Americans. This oft-quoted statistic is actually a gross overestimation of the problem—recent research suggests that the number of Americans who cannot currently afford health insurance is much lower.
A new study by Dr. June O’Neill, who served as Director of the Congressional Budget Office from 1995-1999, shows that nearly half of those uninsured Americans could likely afford to purchase health coverage. The average “voluntarily uninsured” household makes $65,000 per year.
We should not rush into the creation of a new, expensive healthcare system without a better understanding of the uninsured population. As long as we continue basing our arguments on inaccurate numbers, it’s hard to see how we can make effective policy decisions.

In March, several teams are going on pilgrimages. The women’s soccer, women’s rugby, and women’s water polo teams are trekking across oceans and continents to visit their respective meccas. There, they’ll watch matches, play games, and, of course, do a little team bonding.
Over spring break, rugby has planned a trip to Dublin, home to the headquarters of the International Rugby Board; women’s soccer is going to Italy, the land of Del Piero and Buffon; while water polo is making their yearly trip to California for fair-weather games against the sport’s best.
GETTING OUT OF DODGE
Each trip has several friendly games scheduled with local teams. Rachelle M. Calixte ’10, a member of the rugby team’s planning committee, says of playing Irish teams, “It’s going to be a little intimidating, but luckily our training has already been underway—we’ve been practicing for about a month now.”
The water polo team will be playing six games in California, more than either international trip. “Water polo on the East Coast is a whole tier level down from the water polo in California,” says water polo team member Devan M. Kennifer ’12. “It’s probably not worth their while to come over here to play teams.”
When not competing, there’s plenty of time for the players to just be together. “One week straight with just the team is going to be incredible,” says soccer team captain Gina A. Wideroff ’11. “We have our mornings, our afternoons, and our evenings planned out on this itinerary that they sent us, and the afternoons are just ‘free time in Milan,’ or ‘free time in Venice.’”
The rugby team, meanwhile, will be in Ireland during a very opportune week. “It’s St. Patrick’s Day while we’re there,” says Calixte. “Also Six Nations, which is a huge rugby tournament in Europe.” Though they couldn’t get tickets to the home games, they’ll still be able to experience Irish sports fanaticism at its best. “I’m sure we can find tons of places to watch the game with local fans.”
California has its charms as well. “I’m looking forward to playing in outdoor pools again, because all of the pools over here are indoor,” Kennifer says. “And being home,” she adds. She’s not the only one; many of the team’s players are Californians. “We stay at usually team members’ houses, and they give us awesome food and cook for us,” she explains. “We usually don’t use our per diem much, and so we usually go shopping with that money.”
Though water polo players will probably be the only ones meeting each other’s siblings and pets, it turns out the soccer team has some Italian connections. “Our coach is very Italian, too, so I think he’s very excited to go,” says forward Katherine M. Sheeleigh ’11.
“I’m half Italian,” says Wideroff. “I have family in Bologna and I think in Milan. I have two cousins Mario and Luigi who live over there. I’m not kidding,” she adds. “Hopefully I’ll get together with them.”
CLEARING THE HURDLES
These trips, however, don’t appear out of nowhere. Rugby, a club team without direct support from the athletic department, appointed a board of players to work out the details. Calixte, who was in charge of arranging games, says, “People are busy—we’re all still Harvard kids. The actual planning is sometimes really difficult.”
Varsity teams like soccer and water polo, on the other hand, were aided by the administration. Water polo, backed by funding from Friends of Harvard, used their coach’s contacts and players’ homes. The soccer team hired an external company, XL Soccer Tours, to arrange the trip. Forward and midfielder Christina L. L. Hagner ’10, hadn’t realized until fairly recently that the soccer trip, which was originally slated for last year, was on the schedule. “I had no idea this trip was going to happen and then just about three months ago it got announced that it would,” she explains.
That might have been because finances were the soccer team’s only responsibility. “We’ve done nothing except for fundraise. We sold T-shirts, I believe, championship T-shirts. Each player is just responsible for coming up with a certain amount of money,” Wideroff says.
Calixte says, “[Rugby] is doing several Dorm Crew fundraisers, and everyone on the trip has to do a minimum of five hours.” As a destination, Dublin turned out to be the most reasonable option. “It’s actually one of the cheaper alternatives that we looked into—cheaper plane tickets than Spain and places in the Caribbean,” she says. A priority for the team was that all players could go. “We wanted everyone who wanted to go on this trip to be able to come,” explains Calixte.
STAYING IN FOCUS
Though the athletes can’t wait for spring break, their minds are still focused on the games beyond. The soccer team’s trip to Italy gives them more time to practice in their off season. “Every spring in general—it’s an Ivy League rule—you’re given 10 practices but because we’re going on this trip we’re given five extra practices,” Wideroff explained. “We come out of Italy and start our 10 practices and we’re already playing like a team. We won’t waste any time.”
For rugby, the two games abroad will be their first of the season, but Calixte has other plans for their nights off. “Our team loves to dance. We just like to have a good time wherever we go.”

Independent film producer Mynette A. Louie ’97 recently returned to her old stomping grounds to promote her latest work with director Tze Chun, Sundance selection “Children of Invention.” The film, which tells the story of two Chinese-American children after their single mother disappears, premiered in Cambridge this past weekend, and screenings are scheduled for next week in New York and Los Angeles. A former East Asian Studies concentrator and Dunster resident, Louie graduated Phi Beta Kappa and went on to work in business and management, first in the media industry and now in film. She sat down to chat with FM about the highs, the lows, and the hotties of the indie film world.
1. Fifteen Minutes: You’re a big-name producer in indie film. First things first: what does a producer do?
Mynette A. Louie: Not exactly — I wouldn’t say I’m a big-name producer. I’m more like an emerging producer. My answer to that is always what does a producer not do? The producer does not direct or write, but that’s about it. They do everything from raising finances to overseeing the physical production of the film, to distribution, to marketing, to hiring cast and crew.
2. FM: What drew you to producing?
MAL: I’ve always been split-brained. I’ve liked business and math stuff just as much as I’ve loved creative stuff, so producing is a nice marriage of the business and creative sides.
3. FM: When did you discover your interest in film?
MAL: I grew up in New York tripping over film sets. I’ve always been interested in film but I never thought of it as something practical to do, and it isn’t really. But I just fell in love with it. I started off in the magazine and publishing world—in the business side—and I did not really like it. After 9/11 I rethought my career and decided to switch to film producing.
4. FM: You concentrated in East Asian Studies at Harvard, focusing on Chinese film and literature. Looking back, should you have concentrated in Visual and Environmental Studies?
MAL: No. Actually, I’m glad I didn’t. All of my experiences, both in my studies and my professional life, even though they were not directly film related, contributed to my skills as a producer.
5. FM: How did your parents react when you told them you were going to make films instead of trade bonds?
MAL: (Laughs) I grew up like the kids in “Children of Invention,” with Chinese immigrant parents. The stereotype is that immigrant parents want their kids to assume traditional doctor, lawyer, business-type positions. My dad was a painter, so he knew firsthand how difficult it was to make it as an artist. But at the same time he has been a stock trader too. Ultimately they are not disappointed. My father is an artist, and my mother is artistically inclined, so they know the draw of the arts.
6. FM: “Children of Invention” has been recognized at dozens of film festivals across the country. What makes this a standout piece?
MAL: A lot of things make this movie special. It features the kind of characters that aren’t often depicted in film. First of all they are [an ethnic] minority. You don’t see many Asian American lead characters on screen, and you don’t see realistic portrayals of immigrants. This film ascribes to a realist aesthetic, so it almost feels like a documentary in terms of documenting the real lives of immigrants and the trials and tribulations they go through. It doesn’t tie things in a neat little bow. The story is more complex and meaningful than what is normally out there.
7. FM: As a young Asian American woman, have you experienced any challenges in the film industry?
MAL: I haven’t really encountered a glass ceiling, although I am still an emerging producer, so maybe somewhere down the line I will. And because I work in the independent film industry, which happens to be very liberal-minded, and I am the producer so I am the person in charge, I have not experienced any direct racism. Sometimes since I am Asian, people think I only make Asian American movies, so I do receive a lot of Asian American scripts, in addition to other scripts.
8. FM: Why do you feel drawn to the indie genre?
MAL: The types of films I choose to produce are a little more complex and meaningful, not to make myself sound grandiose or anything. I definitely like to work on films that tell more complex human stories. Usually films that have some sort of social message to them, nothing overtly propaganda, but talking about the real human condition.
9. FM: The film industry is often associated with glitz and glamour. Is this an accurate representation?
MAL: It’s a fun business. There are parties and festivals and things like that. People dress up, and if people consider that glamorous, then I guess it is. But there is a reason why people call it production—it’s a manufacturing industry ,and it’s very labor-intensive. I’ve done many different professions, and direction and producing a film is by far the hardest thing that you can do. It’s all-consuming, and that part isn’t glamorous. But when it does come time for you to put your film out on the festival circuit, a lot of people see it as glamorous because you go to parties. Even the festivals after a while get a little tiresome after you go to so many and the parties become part of work. Everybody sees the Us Weekly, People magazine side of it.
10. FM: You concentrated in EAS, went on to work in business, and now film. How do you feel your academic choices at Harvard impacted your career path?
MAL: I studied Chinese film and literature so I learned how to think and talk about story, which has been applicable to my film career. I definitely believe in a liberal arts education because the critical thinking and communication skills you learn help you in whatever career you choose. I do believe it’s true that it doesn’t matter what you majored in at college. You should do what you love to do and get good grades. That always helps.
11. FM:  You graduated Phi Beta Kappa. Got any tips for academic success?
MAL: Studying what you love so you actually enjoy reading and writing papers.
12.FM: How is Harvard different now from when you were an undergraduate?
MAL: I haven’t visited much since I graduated. The buildings look pretty much the same. I actually stay involved with the college as an alumni interviewer—it’s really great. It’s really fascinating meeting a new crop of kids every year and every so often a kid I interview will get in, and it’s a really good feeling. I miss it a lot. Walking around campus is very odd and nostalgic.
13. FM: What words of wisdom do you have for budding artists at Harvard?
MAL: Try to develop some practical skills in addition to your creative, artistic skills. It is challenging to work in the arts. In the independent film industry in particular, it’s hard to pay the bills. Everyone I know in the industry has to have another part-time job. It helps to have some kind of practical, marketable skill that will help pay the bills while you develop your art.
14. FM:  Who is your favorite actor in the indie realm? Least favorite?
MAL: There are so many great actors, it’s hard to choose, but I recently saw Ramin Bahrani’s “Chop Shop,” and the lead kid in that, Alejandro Polanco, is fantastic. Michelle Williams is also always great. And least favorite? It would be impolitic to say exactly who, but let’s just say it’s a certain young starlet.
15. FM: Do you have ny indie crushes?
MAL: Mark Ruffalo. He was on my plane to Berlin a few weeks ago, and he’s even cuter in person.

Those who entered the Women’s Center last Thursday night were met with a wall of advertisements featuring perfectly toned bodies and flawless skin. By the time they left, however, the skeletal figures of the models—flaunting the wares of companies such as Olay and Ralph Lauren—had been written on and called out for their false portrayals of the female figure.
The event, “Pixel Perfect? (Re)Drawing the Lines of Beauty,” was led by R.J. Jenkins, a tutor in Lowell House and Ph.D. candidate in English, with the intention of sparking a dialogue about the doctoring of images in the media.
Chava E. Kenny ’12, a Women’s Center staff member who contacted Jenkins about facilitating the discussion, commented on the significance of such alterations. “If people are holding this as a standard of beauty and not realizing that it’s not real, that it’s distorted, a very unhealthy body image issue for young girls at an impressionable age is created,” Kenny said.
As the group brainstormed solutions for the prevalence of “pixel perfect” bodies in advertisements, the question arose as to what type of message the images actually conveyed.
“These advertisements tend to fit into very specific standards of beauty, not the kind we recognize in everyday life—that’s a kind of beauty that you can’t create, that you can’t capture,” said Reshma A. Lutfeali ’13, who attended the event.
Although there was a common consensus that doctored photos have dangerous latent impacts on body image, there was also an understanding that they are unlikely to go away.
But Jenkins offered one potential solution to the problem. “People need to be taught to recognize an image or text for what it is, rather than consume it passively and not understand what it is trying to accomplish,” he said.
Thus, the written comments on the advertisements. As one student jotted on the leaner, tanner image of a model: “She looked better before!”

Hey, Professor Caroline Light! You partnered up with PBHA to speak at an event where you discussed sex and citizenship.  How exactly are those two concepts related?
Depending on who you are and where you stand, sex and citizenship can be inextricably linked. But first, we need to define what we mean by “sex”—if we mean, for example, physiological factors characterizing one as male or female, then we can think about the ways in which women might experience national belonging differently from men. The fact that women had limited access to the vote until suffrage was granted in 1920, that until quite recently women could not have their own credit lines without the approval of their husbands or fathers, the fact that women still earn substantially less than men on average. And of course race and class influence one’s access to the rights and privileges of citizenship in concrete ways as well, usually in conjunction with notions of sex difference. If we mean “sex” as sexual orientation and/or erotic desire, we should consider how dominant understandings of what constitutes “natural” as opposed to “unnatural” sex frame one’s rights to privacy and free expression.

Shabbos eve, Little Bo Peep and Her Two Slutty Sheep were invaded by a dose of reality--gate-crashing NEDs in camo. Later, 14P was home to some rowdy Chosen People and their yeladim.
Meanwhile, the Delphic ushered some chosen ladies into their own upper sanctum. Must have been refreshing not to be coralled in their den of iniquity.   Our favorite blonde rower puked and rallied her way to a more upscale basement: she may be a heavyweight on the Charles, but we suspect she’s a lightweight after all. Next time we suggest she bolster herself with some carbs, as apparently everyone’s favorite pizza joint was quite the place to be seen and heard. But our award for worst drunk goes to a not-so-cowardly Lion on the pudding prowl, who after unsuccesfully wooing four other gentlemen, found one sucker to take him home for the night.

Fifteen Minutes: First of all, how did you get involved in the film business?
Daniel J. Rubin: I was living in Chicago and doing a lot of different things. I was writing for a children’s television show, and I was working for two different theater groups. I was writing songs and performing at local clubs, and I wrote short films and produced them on the weekends using equipment from corporate media departments, and actors I knew from the theater, and somebody suggested I should write a movie, so I wrote a movie. And I sold it and thought, “That was easy,” so all of a sudden I was a writer.
2.FM: What was your fallback plan, if that hadn’t worked out? Is there another field that you would have gone into?
DJR: No. There was no plan [laughs]...I was just going in every direction and waiting for something to choose me, and that was the first thing that came along that actually broke out. I mean, I was writing corporate media films, and that was never something I wanted to do for a living. It was just better than flipping pizzas.
3.FM: You got your B.A. in Biology. How does that align with your other interests?
DJR: It was more of an evolution. I liked Biology and at some point I realized that it was easier for me to get a degree in Biology and just get a general undergraduate education than to switch to something else, and so I was taking courses in everything. And I was interested in the media, but I thought maybe I’d get involved in the science educational media or something like that. I wanted a job at Nova, but I couldn’t get it, so then I was like “Okay, now what?”
4.FM: Why screenwriting, as opposed to other forms of writing?
DJR: Because it came naturally for some reason. I had written short stories, and I never thought that I really got a handle on my voice, and I’m a lousy poet, and there’s something about the economy of screenwriting that seems natural to me.
5.FM: What exactly do you mean by the economy of screenwriting?
DJR: I think, for instance a novelist has the luxury of describing the room that they are in and every detail of the environment and the internal state of the character, but in screenwriting you really have to just get to the point, and I’m good at that.
6.FM: Do you think that you have a different outlook from other professors in English departments?
DJR: I haven’t asked them. But I do know that it is definitely helpful in a practical way. Screenwriting is a commercial art, and understanding how what you’re writing is perceived by the business of film is helpful.
7.FM: What’s the process like of getting a movie made? You write the script – then what happens?
DJR: Then I give it to my agent, and he says, “It’s wonderful, I’ll go sell it.” And then he doesn’t.  [Laughs] And then I say, “What happened?” It goes something like that.
8.FM: Once it’s been picked up, what is the role of the screenwriter during filming?
DJR: It’s been a while. I’ve had three movies with my credits, and they’ve all been different. One movie was completely rewritten, and I didn’t really have anything to do with it; it was just sort of based on my original screenplay. On one movie, the director and I had a parting of the ways, and so I was not really involved once they began shooting, and then my best experience was “Groundhog Day,” where I was involved in preproduction and rewriting and the whole being-on-the-set shebang.
9.FM: What did “Groundhog Day” mean to you?
DJR: Well it’s all positive things. I mean, it’s very easily the defining work of my professional life, and no matter what I do from here on in, it’s the one I’m most associated with. It has brought me nothing but good things.
10.FM: Do you celebrate Groundhog Day in your household?
DJR: Pretty much. I mean, people call me from all over the place who wouldn’t cross the street to say “Boo” on my birthday. Friends, family, they always see “Groundhog Day” and go, “Oh, Danny, I should give him a call,” so I usually sit at home and field phone calls and e-mails. Sometimes we have a dance party, make a big pot of groundhog stew, which is any stew, but if you call it groundhog stew it becomes a celebration.
11.FM: What are your current projects?
DJR: I have two projects that I’m working on that are current, but one of them I wrote for the first time 10 years ago, and I’ve been rewriting it ever since. It keeps almost being produced and then nothing happens. As I pointed out to the producer last week, my daughter is 20. When I first wrote this she was 10.
12.FM: And the second project?
DJR: That’s another original script that I finally put on the marketplace, and I’ve gotten a couple of offers, so we’re negotiating.
13.FM: If you had to name your all time top five films, what would they be?
DJR: That’s tough, but I started a list just for references. I don’t know if this is actually it.  These are actually things I just wanted to remember to make copies of for the students. I could say “Brazil,” “Blow Up,” “The Conversation,” “Kind Hearts and Coronaries.”
14.FM: One more.
DJR: Really, is that four? I don’t know. There must be something that I just watch and go, “Oh, I love that movie.” I don’t know, I don’t know. I guess I could say “Casablanca” if that’s not too boring.
15.FM: What advice would you give to aspiring screenwriters?
DJR: Keep writing.

Executive Producer and writer for the hit show “Lost,” A. Carlton Cuse ’81 took a break from writing the show’s finale for an event almost as anxiously anticipated—his interview with FM. Cuse let us in on a few “Lost” secrets as we talked about making it in Hollywood, running Primal Scream, and locating Harvard’s Dharma Initiative station.
1. Fifteen Minutes: You graduated from Harvard in 1981. What did you want to do when you graduated? Did you know you wanted to be in television?
Carlton Cuse: I didn’t know at all I wanted to do TV. I thought I might go to law school. I might want to become a history professor. Then I met this guy who was a few years ahead of me. He was a young exec at a movie studio and he came back to Harvard with a few people involved with “Airplane.” They wanted to test it with a smart audience to help them time the jokes for the movie. I helped them set up a screening in Science Center B and I said to them, “How do I get into the business?” They said, facetiously, “make a movie.” I didn’t get that they were being facetious...
At Harvard I had spent most of my time doing heavyweight crew, so I made a documentary about it. I basically went to the crew coach, Harry Parker, who is still around, and said, “Can I get names of alumni to ask them for money to make the movie?” He said no, so I went into the boat house at night and copied the names of alumni down from the pictures there. I then went to the general directory, found their addresses, and sent them the letters. I also got money from the Office for the Arts, which I am a supporter of today. The grant gave me seed money to make this documentary and it instilled me with confidence that the project had validity. I made it in partnership with another student who was in my class. We sold it. I later got a job in L.A. as an assistant to the head of a movie studio.
2. FM: How did you first get involved with “Lost”?
CC: I fell in love with the material. I saw a rough cut of the pilot and a few scripts. This became one of the points in my life when I decided to pursue something based on passion, not money. I was working on the latest iteration of “Charlie’s Angels,” but it wasn’t anything I felt deeply about. “Lost” was something that fired every synapse in my brain. The cool thing was that at the time, nobody thought “Lost” was going to work, and this gave us freedom. We thought it would be 12 [episodes] and out. We said, “Let’s make the coolest 12 episodes of television that we can.” The hope was, at the very least, we would make a show that would be like a cool cult thing on DVD, like “Twin Peaks.” We decided we were going to make a show that we thought was cool. We violated elements of television, like having a big cast and then killing off big characters right away. We had characters who were incredibly complex, and intentionally ambiguous story lines, all these things we weren’t supposed to do.
3. FM: You mentioned that there was always the possibility the show would be “12 and out.” When did you realize the show had a longer future?
CC: We were somewhere around episode eight or nine when the ratings for the pilot and the first few episodes came out, and they were massive. Then it became clear it wasn’t going to be 12 and out.
4. FM: Did anything from your time at Harvard influence your writing for the show?
CC: One of my mentors is my former teacher, Robert Coles. There’s a huge poster in my office of Sawyer on “Lost” reading a Walker Percy novel, which I read in Coles' class, "Moral and Social Inquiry." The themes of that class permeated deeply into my writer’s brain. I took physics, and lo and behold, there’s a lot of physics in “Lost.” I think for most people, liberal arts educations are more abstract, but for me, it’s been a chance to apply the things I’ve learned more directly. I also took some Folklore and Mythology classes, and I think that a lot of that influenced me. I took a great class about the literature of moral and social reflection, which covered everything from philosophy to the Bible. It’s funny how at the time of the course I had no idea that these things would have such a direct application to the things I do for my profession.
5. FM: We’ve heard members of FOP—the Freshman Outdoor Program—brag about your role in starting the organization. What do FOP and being on the island have in common?
CC: Yes, I’m one of the founding instructors of the Freshman Outdoor Program. I went to the Putney School in Vermont for high school. It’s on a farm. There were mandatory camping trips and it was really focused on the outdoor experience. As a kid from southern California, I learned a lot of wilderness skills. Not that much that happened with the Putney School or FOP is directly related to “Lost,” since they didn’t have much to do with smoke monsters. However, it somehow fed into the whole creative process.
6. FM: It gave you an appreciation of the wilderness?
CC: Totally. On my second FOP trip, during my senior year, we got into the vestiges of a hurricane and had to get off the river and take shelter in this storage equipment building in a state park. It felt a lot like “Lost.” I had all these incoming freshmen on a very wild and wet experience.
7. FM: So there’s “Lost” mythology, but there’s also Harvard mythology. Do you know about the three things you have to do before you graduate?
CC: No. What are they?
FM: Before you graduate, you’re supposed to run naked during Primal Scream, pee on the John Harvard statue, and have sex in the Widener stacks.
CC: I did none of those three. The run started after I graduated.
8. FM: How about peeing on the foot?
CC: (Laughs) I think all three of those have evolved after my time there.
9. FM: A lot of other things have evolved. People are now watching TV online, maybe on their laptops in their beds. Has this changed the way people write or experience television?
CC: My partner Damon Lindelof and I won an Emmy this past year for interactive media. We’ve done a lot of things in “Lost” that have been groundbreaking, like writing for other media platforms and creating “mobisodes” designed to be watched on cell phones. It’s an Internet driven experience. We’re recruiting people to become interested in the Dharma Initiative. When we write for social media platforms, we write more about the mythology, because that is what these viewers are interested in. We include things that feel too esoteric to put on the TV series.
It’s been groundbreaking for the relationship between fans and the show. All the resources available have totally helped the show’s success. If we lived in a time where people couldn’t watch “Lost” on Hulu or record it on their DVR, we wouldn’t necessarily have succeeded. We need people to be able to catch up. Now you choose when you watch TV. We wouldn’t have survived in the old days because people would have missed episodes. Out of that, there has grown an incredible, fervent community of people who debate and discuss the show. As a writer, you want people to care about what you do. It’s amazing to see how engaged people have become. There are friendships that develop among fans and people have even gotten married. It’s beyond what we ever imagined.
10. FM: “Lost” superfans run a huge number of blogs like “Lostpedia” that discuss theories and the mythology of the show. Do you ever read them?
CC: There are a couple guys in my office who summarize and update me on what’s going on. The reason for that is, as an artist, you can be susceptible to the slings and arrows of critics. In our view, people on blogs represent a particular subset of the show. They’re focused on the mythology of the show, whereas when we do the show we’re about 90 percent focused on character and 10 percent on mythology. It’s easy to get a skewed perception of the show based on these people. Plus, the writing is so far ahead of what’s being shown on TV at the time. For example, right now you’ve seen only a few episodes of the show this season, but we are writing the finale. There’s no opportunity to course-correct.
12. FM: What are you reading now?
CC: I am reading “Wolf Totem” by Jiang Rong, but right now I’m so busy writing, I have all these books stacked up that I have not yet read. I have this book, Stephen King's "Under the Dome" sitting here. It’s definitely the carrot at the end of the stick to finish the show. I’m saving some books until I write the end of the finale. I’m excited about that.
FM: I love that you read as a reward for finishing your work. At Harvard you constantly hear people complaining about how much reading they have to do. That’s our only job. That puts things in perspective.
CC: It’s awesome! Come on. It’s so awesome.
13. FM: If you weren’t involved in running a hit television show, what would be your dream job?
CC: That is pretty easy. My dream job would be to be the president of the Red Sox. It’s actually great because in this year, where “Lost” is under immense scrutiny as we’re going into the final episodes, I understand the pressure of that job, and I’m ready.
14. FM: I don’t know how often your kids call you, but I bet they will be reading this interview. Is there a message we can relay in print?
CC: Both my wife and I went to Harvard, and it’s incredibly exciting that our son and daughter are going there and have the chance to experience it. There are many awesome opportunities at Harvard. That’s one of its greatest frustrations—not having enough time to take the classes you want to take. Now my kids are there and they can study all the things I wish I had had time to study.
15. FM: Last, but perhaps most importantly, if there were a Dharma Initiative station on Harvard’s campus, where would it be?
CC: I think a cool place would be somewhere down in the bowels of Widener. I remember finding secret tunnels running from Widener to Pusey Library one morning. There’s something cinematic about being down in the basement of Widener. It’s classic, like an Indiana Jones adventure movie.

Blocking drama got you down? Can’t wait to finally have things settled, gather all your Rubi-filled water bottles, and get your boat-burning drink on? Sorry young freshies, but with law enforcement stepped up for this year’s festivities, you might want to rethink those plans—you’re never going to get that Goldman internship with an arrest on your record. Lucky for you, FM has already come up with 15 ways to not get arrested (or 15 other ways to get arrested—we’re not quite sure) on Housing Day Eve.
1) Pond Run: Fresh Pond is only about two miles away. Doubtful there’ll be any security there.
2) Use your nearest river house bathtub: If you take enough shots and turn the lights off, you won’t even know the difference.
3) Teepee the Quad: Instead of appeasing the river gods, just piss off the Quad deities, and they won’t want you there anyway.
4) Blodgett Pool: You better have blocked with the swim team.
5) Morning River Run: The po-po should be gone by 6 a.m. Hide out in a bush ’til the coast is clear.
6) Quad Run: Oh wait—you’d have to take the shuttle to get there. Does it even run on Wednesday nights?
7) River Dance: Bring back the ’90s phenomenon and dance your way into Adams or Eliot.
8) Exploit your supernerd peers: Maybe they can invent something to make the boat drive itself to the river.
9) Dress up as a police officer: If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em.
10) Salvia: You don’t have to burn a boat; you are the boat.
11) Just drown your boat in alcohol: Alcohol solves all problems.
12) Launch it from the highest tower of Eliot: Let’s hope you’re blocking with the softball team.
13) Street walk: Slap some wheels on that boat and let it burn, baby, burn. Mill Street is parallel to the river, so it’s practically the same thing.
14) Kirkland Run: Run through the basement halls while shrieking the Kirkland Ode at the top of your lungs. Then pass out in the courtyard hammock hugging the Kirkland pups and dreaming of Secrect Santa Week.
15) YouTube: Worse comes to worst, open your computer to watch past River Run experiences and cry yourself to sleep while dreaming you were burning your boat.

Green is the new black, and sustainability has been declared our savior. Yet scientists still face an uphill battle for the fickle attentions of the public. Sung H. Kang, Boaz Pokroy, and Joanna Aizenberg of the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences turned to visual art. They collectively won the photography division of the International Science and Engineering Visualization Challenge, which awards images that present complicated research in a layman-friendly way—images that bring the science to the people.
Bringing science to the people is Professor Aizenberg’s passion, and stunning pictures her weapon of choice. The winning photo’s title, “Save Our Earth. Let’s Go Green,” is a nod to her area of focus: collaborative research in approaches to sustainability. The image features tiny plastic fibers designed to reach out and capture foreign objects.
Yet there’s also an artistic significance to the photo’s title. For the researchers, the image brought to mind humanity’s attempts to work together and combat the looming environmental crisis. Against a background of darkness, “the multiple fingers metaphorically present our efforts—mine, yours, and everybody else’s—holding the planet together,” Aizenberg said.
The research team hopes that imagery like theirs will help to recapture the public imagination and reach out to those generally unimpressed by the realities of science research. “Scientific images help us to appreciate the beauty of science without any equation,” said Kang, a graduate student in Aizenberg’s lab. Felice Frankel, Senior Research Fellow and one-time judge of the Visualization Challenge, couldn’t agree more: “This isn’t about speaking down to non-scientists; it’s about engaging them to be as excited about our world,” she said.
The challenge science faces is one all too familiar to high school chess captains and economists at dinner parties: the challenge of convincing people that what you do really is interesting. With images like this, Professor Aizenberg is getting people to ask questions. “If the first thing they see is that they like the image and only after they decide to read what science is behind it, I think I have achieved what I wanted,” she said.

If you walked into Adams C-entryway this Saturday night, only the plastic Coke bottles and the denim-clad undergrads would remind you that you were still in the 21st century. With the regal grace of 1940s high society, alumni and students alike gathered in Adams House for the third annual FDR Memorial Lecture and Gala Dinner. A speech given by Franklin Roosevelt’s grandson, Curtis Roosevelt, was followed by a black-tie dinner and dancing, complete with a live 10-piece orchestra playing jazz standards from the ’30s and ’40s.
The event was organized by the FDR Suite Foundation, which is working to restore Roosevelt’s college suite on the second floor of C-entryway, back to its 1903 condition. it will serve as a memorial for Roosevelt and as accomodations for important guests of the College.
“All the other presidents have been heavily commemorated on campus,” said Michael D. Weishan ’86, president of the FDR Suite Foundation. “Poor Franklin was left alone.”
Tickets were a whopping $175 per plate to the event, but in the spirit of the New Deal, some were made available for free to undergraduates on a first-come, first-serve basis. And true to Harvard College form, the event mixed high class with even higher class by inviting the Roosevelt Institute, a student group dedicated to progressive government policy, to help bring some undergraduate flair to the event.
Matthew H. Young ’12, president of the Roosevelt Institute, who was sporting a tie with different images of FDR, emphasized the importance of the event’s classiness.
“When R.I. throws a party, we take it old school,” said Young, as he carried a Harvard alumni pennant around the room with a slightly wobbling gait.
“It’s about being classy without being wasted and drunk while at the same time advancing our policies,” he said. “We’ll do beer pong, but we can do better.”
While the tastefully conservative dancing didn’t get going until 8:30 p.m., the lecture preceding it was almost more raucous thanks to an open bar.
“Adams House throws the best parties,” said Tweed Roosevelt ’64, the great-grandson of President Theodore Roosevelt, class of 1880. “It did when I was here, and it still does.”
This odd dichotomy of high-class alums and reveling undergrads mixed with surprising fluency. “I think this is a great opportunity for interface between alums and students. They’re not old people. They’re young at heart,” said Young, winking to a nearby alumna.
“I love him already!” she responded.

Say what you will about Americans.
Say that they’re fat and ugly and stupid and selfish and always causing wars and hypocritical in their Middle East politics and short-sighted and entitled and ignorant and smelly and hairy and hairless and inconveniently culturally diverse and bad at rugby and reckless with their abundant natural resources and that they’re lecherous and thieving and unpoetical and prone to unnecessary revolution and under-appreciative of Tom Waits who has consistently sold more albums abroad than in his home country which should theoretically provide more than a cult base for an artist widely considered to be one of the best living songwriters.
Say all this. Say more. Say whatever you want.
They make good movies.
Great ones. The greatest films ever made by anyone.
And unlike other grand filmic traditions that have since died—the Swedes ran out of sorrow, the Italians refocused their efforts on being stereotpyed—the Americans are still going at it, year after year producing at least a handful of films that don’t just fill our theaters, but massage our hearts and minds.
This is not to say we don’t also make bad ones, such as Tommy Wiseau’s brilliantly terrible “The Room,” which has “the passion of Tennessee Williams” and the narrative coherency of a sloshed toddler.
But terrible films aside, at the end of the day, no country holds a candle to the flicks of the American canon. If anyone ever tried to, Michael Bay would just engulf that candle in an apocalyptic CGI flame fest while rocking out to the screaming strains of System of a Down’s “B.Y.O.B.”
It’s this consumptive national pride afflicting so many Americans, be they stock brokers or broke stockers, that makes the Academy Awards such a big deal.
And not just for the networks that air the ceremony. A quick Google search for “Oscar Buzz” returns a full two-thirds of the hits of “Iraq War,” and the fourth hit when Googling “Iraq War” is an article about “Avatar” and “The Hurt Locker.”
But there’s one more thing we haven’t said about Americans: that they have bad taste. That they don’t want to be moved by great films. That they only want to be amused.
Just look at the success of such critical masterpieces as “Transformers II: Revenge of the Fallen” and “Alvin and the Chipmunks 2: The Squeakquel,” which placed second and ninth respectively at the 2009 box office. What does this say about the current American public if not that its theatrical tastes are cheapening? And what does this portend but the imminent and inevitable decline of the movie as a legitimate art form?
Since some recent self reflection has led me to realize that movies are the only non-edible things I care about, I’ve been having something of a life crisis over this.
If I love movies, and movies only, and movies of quality are quickly becoming an unlucrative thing of the past, then what becomes of little old me? Don’t tell me I’ve got to get into ear-movies, colloquially known as “music.”
To solve my crisis, I decided to rewatch my favorite film, “Ratatouille.” And the character Anton Ego reminded me that my problem, like so many in life, was simply one of “perspective.”
Take “Transformers II.” Admittedly, it screwed the pooch, but its success was just a natural and understandable consequence of “Transformers,” a movie that many thought effing rocked—this reviewer included.
Even “Alvin and the Chipmunks,” while admittedly an abomination, at least finished far behind the top grossing animated feature “Up,” a movie that grabbed an Oscar nomination for best picture and best animated picture.
And the story gets even better. The year’s top grossing film, “Avatar,” was by many estimates the best film of the year, and “The Hangover,” “Star Trek” and “The Blind Side,” the sixth, seventh and eighth top-grossing films respectively, were each critically acclaimed.
So how about we all just relax and grab some perspective. And you know what helps with that? Here’s a hint: it ends with “-ovies.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over 200 elated gay and lesbian couples waited in line outside Washington, D.C.’s City Courthouse yesterday morning in anticipation of obtaining licenses that would allow them to legally marry their partners. While this is a significant step in the fight for marriage equality nationwide, some members of the Harvard community have questioned D.C.’s ruling in light of the federal Defense of Marriage Act.
Mayor Adrian M. Fenty signed the measure approving same-sex marriage last December, but because D.C. is not a state, the law had to go through a 30-day Congressional review. After failed attempts to block the bill in the House and in the courts, the bill officially became law on Tuesday.
History professor Nancy F. Cott, who has researched legal institutions and marriage in the United States and has testified during the Proposition 8 case in California, said she was skeptical of the consequences of the new law.
“What is curious about [the ruling] is that this has been done under a Congress still in support of the Defense of Marriage Act,” she said. “D.C. is not a state, it is a federal territory, which means there is a direct conflict between what the D.C. standard is and what federal law is.”
Harvard Kennedy School lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy ’93 also said that the fact that D.C. falls under federal jurisdiction could create a problematic situation, but noted that the legalization of same-sex marriage in D.C. was an exciting development.
“Any jurisdiction that extends rights of same-sex couples is really important, a sign of moving in a more progressive direction as a country,” McCarthy said. “As a legal and a moral battle, this ultimately needs to be at the national level.”
Sean Eldridge, Communications Director at Freedom to Marry, a nationwide campaign for marriage equality that has played a role in the fight in D.C., said that this is an important development in achieving marriage equality.
“People will see that the sky isn’t going to fall, that there’s no harm being done,” Eldridge said, stating that D.C. is only the sixth jurisdiction to sanction same-sex marriage. “It’s also a reminder that there’s still a lot of work to do, and people are no longer okay living in a country where this kind of discrimination continues.”
For advocates of the legalization of same-sex marriage, the issue doesn’t stop at the altar. Rather, it is seen as one feature of a multifaceted fight for equal citizenship.
“Progress on marriage equality is encouraging and is hopefully accompanied by increased action on other legal rights, like employment non-discrimination and healthcare,” said Marco Chan ’11, co-chair of Harvard Queer Students and Allies. “Marriage is one part in the full spectrum of equality for queer people across legal, economic, and social fronts.”
McCarthy said that marriage equality is a single aspect of a much broader struggle against all forms of discrimination, including barred adoption rights, unequal tax codes, and healthcare disparities, among others.
“Change is coming, but change is slow,” McCarthy said. “Any time an advance for the LGBT community happens I think that should be cause for celebration.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students stood in a small line in Lamont Cafe last night, awaiting the chance to decompress under the helping hands of the Stressbusters—a team of Harvard students offering free five to seven-minute backrubs.
The Stressbusters are currently offering backrubs in Lamont Cafe on Wednesdays from 8:30 to 9:30 p.m., and they hope to make their services a weekly staple for overworked and over-tense students.
“We are very good-intentioned,” said Program Coordinator Vanessa Dremonas, a student at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. “We are not creepy strangers.”
Upon emerging from an “amazing” backrub courtesy of the Stressbusters, Victor M. Flores ’13 said that his shoulders felt less tense—a boon, he added, since he had a long night of midterm preparation ahead of him.
“It gave me a boost,” Flores said. “During times like this, when for some reason all of my papers are due at the same time, it is nice to have a break like this.”
Dressed in matching white T-shirts emblazoned with Stressbuster logos, the team—which consists entirely of students—rubbed the shoulders, backs, arms, and necks of willing clients.
“We all use the same pattern of techniques,” said Stressbuster G. Andrew Conway ’11. “We each have our own style.”
The Stressbusters showcase their personal styles through varied techniques, such as ‘Bladerunner,’ which begins with a massage at the base of the neck and eventually moves outward to the shoulders, according to Conway.
Other rubbing techniques include the ‘The Catwalk’ and ‘Texting Treatment’—the latter focusing on a massage of the forearms and hands.
“We are always texting or on the computer,” said Dremonas, adding that the ‘Texting Treatment’ can prevent help carpal tunnel syndrome. “You don’t think that your forearms are tense until you have someone work on them.”
Dremonas said that during former Stressbuster events, she had been surprised by students’ reluctance to leave their studies for a few minutes to receive free backrubs.
“It is a five-minute break,” Dremonas said. “It’s not tiring—it’s reenergizing.”
The Stressbusters also make appearances at events held by student organizations on campus. Last semester, the team offered backrubs at a study break in Annenberg Hall.
Wellness Center Director Jeanne M. Mahon said that she hopes to expand the group, increase its presence on campus, and eventually have a Stressbuster representative in every House.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An active group of parents won a two-week effort on Tuesday protesting a 2010-2011 school year budget cut proposal that would affect a bilingual immersion program for Portuguese-English speakers at the King Open School in Cambridge.
The estimated $58,000 to $60,000 budget cut would have eliminated instruction of all academic subjects in grades K-8 in both Portuguese and English—a key aspect of the OLA program, which aims to provide a full academic curriculum for all students to become bilingual and develop creativity and critical thinking, according to the school Web site.
At Tuesday’s Committee meeting, Cambridge Public Schools Superintendent Jeffrey M. Young and School Committee members decided to keep cuts to OLA off the table.
Young said that School Committee members have consistently urged him to look closely at the program, but the proposal to scrap the Two-Way aspect of the OLA program has drawn many concerns among parents, teachers, and students.
Elizabeth Hammond, a parent who spearheaded the movement to keep the OLA program unchanged, said that the proposed changes would have “[undone] how the program worked.” She also said that the teachers at the King Open School were “devastated” about the possible adjustments to the program.
Monique Pinto, a sixth grader who has spent eight years in the OLA program, also voiced concern over the potential changes.
“This program inspires me because I get to learn about my culture and American culture,” she said. “When I found out [about the budget cut proposal], I got upset.”
Following the announcement of proposed changes, Hammond and more than 25 other parents met on Feb. 24 and 25 to discuss their course of action. They planned appearances at the Cambridge School Committee meetings, drafted a written and online petition, and set up a Web site to garner further support for preserving the program in its current state.
The parents made their first showing at the Tuesday meeting in the Sullivan Chamber in City Hall. Crowds of parents filled the room, donning OLA nametags and matching red carnations—the symbol of the Carnation Revolution in 1974, a coup that brought democracy to Portugal.
Young said he met with parents and community members for a “fruitful discussion” on Monday, the day before the Committee meeting, and Hammond said that the superintendent deserved “a lot of credit” for the Committee’s decision.
“I appreciate the process,” Hammond said. “[The budget cut proposal] felt like an injustice but because there was a format, it worked out.”
According to Hammond, parents had planned to reconvene and make a second appearance next Tuesday if the School Committee kept the budget proposal cut on the table.
“It was beautiful that we didn’t have to wait till next Tuesday. I’m very, very happy,” said Odete Silva, another parent who advocated for the program.

A group including several Harvard researchers has developed a new microfluidic screening device that can run biochemical experiments on a much smaller, faster, and more cost-effective scale.
The team, which included scientists from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and other universities, said that the technology could transform the way experiments are conducted.
The device, which effectively reduces the scale of the laboratory from test tubes to water droplets, can be used in a variety of fields, with applications ranging from drug screening to biofuel development.
The scientists recently demonstrated the device’s utility in experiments on directed evolution, with results published Tuesday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
“The idea is to build a system where we can do large number of reactions very quickly,” said Adam R. Abate ’02, a SEAS post-doctoral physics student and an author of the study. “Each reaction happens in a droplet as opposed to a test tube, and therefore we can get data much more quickly than with a robot or a graduate student.”
Directed evolution—the method of artificially inducing natural selection to evolve desirable proteins or RNA not found in nature—is highly difficult to study in a laboratory setting, according to physics professor David A. Weitz, an author of the study.
The scientists first created many versions of the common enzyme horseradish peroxidase, each with a different mutation.
The standard procedure would then be to introduce each gene into yeast cells, grow the cells, collect and detect the amount of enzymes produced in each strain of yeast, and look for the most favorable strain. These are steps that, when performed with the traditional state-of-the-art robots, would have taken years and millions of dollars to complete.
But with the screening device, the entire procedure was performed in only a few hours and cost a few dollars, according to Weitz.
“Basically, we were able to test a hundred million [mutated strains] over a course of few hours, which is a tremendous speed-up,” said Weitz. “This [new technology] allowed us to ask very fundamental questions about the nature of evolution itself, how to best improve the technology to make new enzymes.”
The researchers said they were excited to debut the technology for commercial purposes. For example, Abate and other collaborators are looking to apply similar technology to find a way to inexpensively sequence an individual’s genome.
“We kept on coming up with new and unexpected areas where we can apply these things,” Weitz said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A pilot program that provided childcare stipends to graduate students with children will be discontinued after this spring, removing an income supplement on which some students have come to rely.
The Doctoral Child Care Student Scholarship Program was founded in 2006 to help graduate student parents in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences fund daycare costs that often surpass the student stipends.
The pilot program—planned to last three years but extended this academic year to last for a fourth—is limited to graduate students with an approximate income below $80,000 whose children are enrolled in one of the six competitive daycare centers associated with Harvard.
But the program only provided stipends to 17 students this year, and University spokesperson Kevin Galvin said that administrators decided in December that the University’s resources should benefit a larger number of individuals in the community.
“We recognize that many graduate students are also parents, and there are new programs under consideration that would help address their needs,” Galvin wrote in an e-mailed statement.
Many graduate student parents learned of the decision to end the scholarship on Tuesday when a parent applying for the scholarship—which offers up to $5,000—forwarded a letter across an email list of student parents explaining that the scholarship had been cut.
“Although the pilot provided significant financial support to some doctoral student parents, it is not possible to continue the program in its current form,” wrote Natalie Beaumont-Smith of the Office of Work/Life Resources, adding that a working group was “actively exploring new strategies to support doctoral student parents.”
Harvard University currently supports six childcare centers for faculty, staff, and students, for which costs can reach as much as $2,000 a month. The centers provide their own financial aid plans in addition to any funding the parents can secure.
Susannah L. Rose, who heads the Graduate Student-Parents Organization that includes 400 students and spouses, said she would appeal to the GSAS administration.
“Several hundred dollars a month is the difference between buying food or not paying your electric bill,” she said.
Concerns over childcare are not limited to GSAS students. April M. Griffin, a single parent at the Medical School, said she is dependent on a similar scholarship program  at the Medical School that has not indicated whether it will be discontinued.
“If they take it away from me, honestly I won’t be able to finish my PhD,” she said.
MAKING ENDS MEET
In December, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith—under whose purview GSAS falls—pledged to increase graduate student stipends by 3 percent.
At the time, GSAS Dean Allan M. Brandt said that the stipend increase would help Harvard attract the most sought after graduate students.
“Generally, the programs we compete with are making similar offers,” Brandt said, and the stipend that is currently offered “is generous but hard to live on.”
The life of a graduate student-parent can involve extensive juggling to make ends meet.
Sebastian Velez is in his sixth year as a PhD student in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, and he has been a parent for the entirety of his studies. His daughter, now six, has “been taking my classes with me since she was born,” he said.
“She draws on the board and interacts with the students. I teach biology so she plays with the skeleton,” Velez said. I’m teaching [Invertebrate Systematic] this semester and so we get live animals like tarantulas. Today she was playing with a leech.”
Velez, a single parent, did not apply for the daycare scholarship. He said he was concerned that if he did not receive the scholarship, which requires preregistration at a daycare center, he would have been obligated to pay for a month of childcare—a cost he could not have afforded.
Making ends meet is hard to do as things stand, Velez said. He currently serves as a resident tutor, assistant resident dean, and sophomore advising coordinator in Kirkland House; acts as a teaching fellow for an undergraduate course; and grades Life Science 1b exams. Last semester, Velez also taught a nighttime course at the Harvard Extension School.
“I didn’t come here to be a tutor, as much as I enjoy it. I came here to research,” Valez said. “I am behind but I’m doing it. I arrive in the lab at eight in the morning after I drop the daughter at school. But I can’t be there until four in the morning. I can’t compete with that.”

Most students spend at most four years involved in the First-Year Outdoor Program—but FOP Director Jessica L. Ross ’03 will have spent over a decade with the program by the time she leaves FOP this May.
Ross—who became acquainted with FOP after attending a six-day pre-orientation camping trip as a freshman, then participated as an undergraduate FOP leader for three years—has resigned from her position to lead one to three week youth empowerment courses through the North Carolina Outward Bound Program.
Ross, who has served as FOP Director since 2006, said that the time had come for her to move on to a new position.
“I’ve reached a point where my learning curve is not as steep as it once was,” she said. “And I’m excited to see where the next learning curve takes me.”
During her time as director, Ross has focused on expanding the program’s socioeconomic diversity. This year, at least 63 percent of the FOP participants received financial aid from Harvard—in comparison, over half the undergraduate population at large received need-based aid.
Ross has also expanded the program’s commitment to fundraising to support the increase in the number of students on financial aid. When Ross entered the program, FOP received $14,000 in donations per year, a figure that has since reached $36,000.
Past FOP participants said they would remember Ross’s influence after her departure.
“She’s been the leader and source of inspiration for the entire program,” said Jonathan M. L. Rosenthal ’13, who participated in FOP this past fall. “Her enthusiasm really gets everyone involved, from the new all the way to the Steering Committee.”
Ross said she intends to stay connected to the FOP community even after her departure.
“I’m not leaving the program, just simply leaving the directorship,” she said.
A replacement for Ross has not yet been chosen. Director for Freshman Programming Katherine W. Steele said she will head a committee comprised of two students and two College staff members to evaluate potential candidates for the position.
Ross’s advice for the next director of FOP was simple.
“Model the kind of leadership that you’d like to see in the students who go on the trips,” she said. “Listen to the students and help empower them to make their dreams a reality.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Harvard Business School graduate John F. Crowley, the importance of biotechnology innovation was personal.
In 1998, Crowley began fighting for his children’s lives after learning that his young son and daughter suffered from Pompe disease, a rare and progressive neuromuscular disorder that is usually fatal. He quit his job and started his own biotechnology company in search of a cure. Eventually,  Cambridge-based biotechnology giant Genzyme acquired Crowley’s company and, in collaboration with Duke University and the Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands, ultimately developed Myozyme—a treatment that saved the lives of Crowley’s children.
That story inspired the film “Extraordinary Measures,” a drama released in January starring Harrison Ford and Brendan Fraser.
The movie captures much of the emotional excitement of the search for a cure, Crowley and a Genzyme representative agree.
But the film also deviates from the true story of how Myozyme was developed, portraying the fictionalized biotech company Zymagen as not being “patient-focused,” according to Genzyme’s associate director of communications, Lori M. Gorski.
Furthermore, the film moves Zymagen to Seattle—far from Cambridge’s dense biotechnology sector—which, according to those who study the industry, is key to promoting innovations that cure disease.
THE SPIRIT OF A FAMILY
The Crowley family’s story first appeared in a series of Wall Street Journal articles in 2003, and later in a 2006 book called “The Cure,” by Geeta Anand. In the fall of 2003, after the publication of the newspaper articles, Crowley and his wife began receiving calls from film producers seeking to make a movie about his experiences. It took the couple the better part of a year to get comfortable enough to sell their life-rights and become accustomed to the idea of their family’s struggle being portrayed on film.
The Crowleys say their decision was ultimately influenced by their trust in Ford, the executive producer of the film who also plays a scientist collaborating with Crowley. The family worked closely with the producers at Doubletree Feature Films throughout the drafting of the screenplay to make sure that the science and family life displayed were accurate.
Crowley says that the film “captures 100 percent of the spirit and dynamic of our family” and describes the experience of being on set and seeing details from their own lives—the clothes they wore, the van they had—come alive on screen as “very surreal.”
Crowley also had a cameo in the movie, playing a venture capitalist in a scene with Ford and Fraser.
“I got to yell at Harrison Ford for two days while we were filming the scene,” Crowley says. “But that’s okay, he yelled back really well.”
LOST IN TRANSLATION
Genzyme’s Gorski echoes Crowley’s praise for the accurate depiction of the family’s struggle. She also credits the film with accurately portraying “The Mother of All Experiments,” the analysis of four experimental drug treatments for Pompe disease, of which Myozyme was determined the most promising product. She says that the film does an especially good job of conveying the sense of urgency cultivated by the experiment, as scientists toiled to find a treatment that would save rapidly declining young patients.
But like many adaptations of true stories, the movie did not stick exactly to the facts, Gorski says.
Gorski describes one scene—inspired by real life events—in which the Crowley family and another family were invited to speak at the company to employees.
“It was a little disappointing in that [the film] made it seem that this fictitious company was not patient-focused and it took this moment [for employees at the company] to realize that lives were at stake,” Gorski says. “That’s something that’s on our mind every day through every trial that’s done here.”
But she acknowledges that artistic considerations sometimes overrule the truth in Hollywood.
“Of course, you need some sort of villain in every movie,” she adds.
Crowley says that the company portrayed in the film is a fictional adaptation and attributes any potential negative connotations to cinematic license.
“In the film, just like in real life, there are no bad people and there are no bad companies. There’s just a very bad disease,” Crowley says.
Additionally, when a 90-minute movie portrays a decade of life, some details are lost in translation, Gorski points out. The limited timeframe led to the compression of some details.
For instance, Ford’s character Robert Stonehill is inspired primarily by scientist William Canfield but is actually a composite of many scientists. Gorski says she is disappointed that no tribute was paid to many of the other scientists, families, and academic institutions that contributed to the development of a treatment.
“In any scientific breakthrough, it’s not the result of one individual or one moment,” Gorski says.
DRIVING INNOVATION
Although the liberty of cinematic license may have shifted the development of Myozyme to Seattle, Genzyme’s real-life location in Cambridge is a crucial resource to the company and indicative of the city’s central role in the biotechnology industry.
Between 430 and 450 biotechnology companies are headquartered in Massachusetts, according to Peter J. Abair, Director of Economic Development at the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council.
Abair calls Cambridge the “core” of the Massachusetts biotechnology industry, explaining that Massachusetts is one of three biotechnology hotspots in the country, along with the San Francisco and San Diego areas.
Crowley, now the chairman and CEO of Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. a biopharmaceutical company in New Jersey, says that with even medium and larger companies cutting back on research and development and many smaller companies having gone out of business, he expects “[to] see five to seven years from now a huge gap in medical investments...a drought.”
Crowley says that there is a need to foster biotechnology not just at the state level, as seen in Massachusetts, but also on a national platform.
“I think [it’s] the one thing that’s absent from the health care debate. You hear about greater distribution to more people, cutting costs, etc...But I don’t know how you can reform the new healthcare system in America and not talk about innovation, driving new technologies,” Crowley says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a panel discussion at the Institute of Politics yesterday, three noteworthy evangelists discussed how their religious traditions, which are often seen as conservative, can offer a progressive view of the fundamental questions that arose following the financial crisis.
The speakers emphasized that society should not overlook the possibility that religion can positively inform politics, despite the political world’s commitment to secularity in modern times.
Jim Wallis, a best-selling evangelical author and president of the Christian social justice organization Sojourners, said that it was important to move beyond the individualistic mindset—as he called it, the “it’s all about me, and I want it now”-attitude.
“I think the Native American ethic is very appropriate: evaluate decisions today on its effect on seven generations from now,” Wallis said, adding that religions can offer a more collectivist view of the consequences of one’s actions on a given community.
“A crisis is a terrible thing to waste. If we don’t use it for a reset on the personal and community level, then all the suffering had been in vain,” Wallis said. “But if this is a time in what a new ‘normal’ should look like, it could be redemptive.”
The kind of decisions that the government now faces are not only factual or empirical, but moral as well, the speakers said. The church can—and should—take a stance on issues of fiscal responsibility and ethics, to participate in the progressive collectivist response to the crisis.
“I’m not trying to convert somebody to my god versus your god,” said Liz Walker, an award-winning television journalist who represents the African Methodist Episcopal Church. “But...religion holds an important message.”
The speakers referenced a recent New York Times column written by Nicholas D. Kristof ’81-’82, who argues that the evangelicals have come to the forefront of current social justice issues.
Harvard Kennedy School professor J. Bryan Hehir, whose work focuses on religion and public life, also participated in the panel discussion.
After the panel, attendee Zachary M. Goldstein ’13 said that he would like such discussions—which challenge the traditional place of religion in relation to politics—to become more mainstream.
“This provided a more nuanced approach,” Goldstein said. “Too often there’s a tendency to lump the evangelical movement into the right side of our politics.”
Dennis M. Mwaura ’12 said he appreciated the panel members’ acknowledgement that religion may have its limits, but nevertheless intersects with politics.
“I’m not religious but I was able to identify with the speakers’ progressive agenda,” Mwaura added.

A can of Full Throttle energy drink in one hand and a cell phone in the other, Harvard Kennedy School student Leland Cheung shared his experiences as the first Asian American Cambridge Councillor with a small group of students and community leaders in Boylston Hall yesterday.
The event was hosted by the Harvard Radcliffe Asian American Association and the Asian Pacific Americans for Progress, a national organization dedicated to supporting progressive candidates and policies.
Harvard Law School student Michelle Wu ’07, director of APAP-Greater Boston, said she decided to organize the event to link the Asian American student community and local leaders with Cheung, a figure whose accomplishment she said can serve as a model for other Asian Americans.
While Cheung said he is still in the process of figuring out the meaning of his historic election, he said that the most important vision he has for the Asian American community is to encourage this demographic to run for public office.
He said that this goal is especially important because though Asian Americans typically outperform other minorities in areas like education and income, they are severely underrepresented in leadership roles.
This discrepancy informed Cheung’s own motivations to run for office.
“None of them looked like me, none were a decade within my age, none really represented me or the people I knew,” Cheung said of the composition of the City Council.
When asked about his prospects for higher offices, Cheung said he intended on “serving Cambridge” and made community the centerpiece of his discussion.
To improve the city, he said he seeks to bring the City Council into the 21st century technologically and to work aggressively to retain small businesses in Cambridge.
As the first University student and youngest member to be elected to the Council in recent memory, Cheung also said he hopes to create more links between residents and students.
Keeping “pretty busy” by pursuing an MBA at the MIT Sloan School of Management and an MPA at the Kennedy School, Cheung said he had the help of student volunteers in mobilizing the community during his campaign.
Throughout the process, Cheung said he walked many miles and knocked on countless doors, a strategy he was surprised to find was used only rarely by candidates.
He said the approach paid off not only because he lost some weight, but because he had the most demographically diverse voting base of the 20 candidates who ran for City Council.

With 15 seconds left in the contest, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team lined up for its final face-off against Georgetown—and its last chance at a game-tying goal—looking to cap an impressive comeback effort that saw the Crimson net four goals in the final two minutes of play.
Unfortunately for No. 11 Harvard (1-1), the last few seconds on the clock would wind down without another tally, as the No. 14 Hoyas (1-1) held on to win the game, 13-12, in a matchup of two nationally-ranked teams yesterday afternoon at Georgetown. The game was the Crimson’s first televised contest of the season.
At the start of the fourth quarter, the Hoyas led Harvard by a mere 8-7, but Georgetown dominated the majority of the final frame, forcing the Crimson to attempt to dig itself out of a late five-goal hole. Constant offensive pressure from the Hoyas, along with a few defensive missteps by Harvard, allowed Georgetown to outscore the Crimson, 5-1, in the first 13 minutes of the quarter.
Despite the deficit, Harvard battled until time ran out. Senior midfielder Travis Burr led the way with two crucial scores, coming with 1:55 and 1:15 remaining. The first goal was unassisted, and the second came with two seconds remaining in a man-up situation, after a pushing penalty removed Hoya Chris Nourse from the game for 30 seconds.
The Crimson’s sophomore duo of attack Kevin Vaughan and midfielder Terry White then contributed the last two late-game goals with 24 and 15 seconds remaining on the clock, respectively. Harvard’s offensive spurt toward the end of the game put Harvard within striking distance of Georgetown, but it proved to be too late.
“We were able to string some goals together [at the close of the fourth quarter],” junior attack Dean Gibbons said. “In the end, it didn’t turn out right, but we made it a lot more interesting than it would have been.”
The first three quarters of the game were characterized by a pair of lead changes and four ties. The Hoyas jumped out to an early 2-0 lead, but after that neither team would find itself more than two goals ahead prior to the fourth quarter. In fact, the Crimson led Georgetown for most of the second and third quarters, and overall, Harvard recorded 42 shots compared to the Hoyas’ 46.
“At times we played really well, and at times we didn’t take advantage of our opportunities,” Gibbons said. “It’s definitely a learning experience for us. We were able to gain some confidence [today that we’ll need later in the season].”
The Crimson offense was spearheaded by sophomore attack Jeff Cohen, Vaughan, and Burr, who tallied three goals each. Both Harvard and Georgetown boasted a balanced offense, as six Crimson players and ten Hoyas scored on the day.
Harvard’s sophomore goalkeeper Christian Coates had a solid performance between the pipes, recording eight saves. Coates was supported by a strong defensive line that halted Georgetown’s attack and generated offensive opportunities for the Crimson.
Senior defenseman Ben Smith capitalized on one such opportunity, netting a goal of his own for the second straight game.
“We were playing aggressive and playing really well,” Smith said. “We were trying to get the other team to make some mistakes…[The movement up-field] all started with the defense. I just had a good lane to the net.”
Contests between Harvard and the Hoyas have traditionally been very tight games. Last year, Georgetown downed the Crimson 9-8, as now senior attack Rickey Mirabito netted the winning goal in overtime. Yesterday’s contest was the second game of the season for both Harvard and the Hoyas, who have each recorded one win and one loss thus far.
“We have a lot of conference games coming up,” junior midfielder Andrew Parchman said. “We want to win every game for rest of season and use these next few games…to get ready for the Ivy League season.”
The Crimson is looking forward to Saturday, when it will continue its very promising season at Holy Cross.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following last week’s losses against Clarkson (8-22-4, 4-15-3 ECAC) and St. Lawrence (15-13-7, 9-8-5), the Crimson narrowly lost home-ice advantage for the first round of the playoffs.
As it kicks off postseason play this weekend in Princeton (12-14-3, 8-12-2) at Hobey Baker Rink, Harvard hopes to leave missed opportunities in the past and start the playoffs with a clean slate.
The two Ancient Eight rivals will duke it out in a best-of-three series beginning on Friday and ending with a third game on Sunday, if necessary.
At the end of the regular season, the ninth-seeded Crimson and the eighth-seeded Tigers were separated by only one point in the ECAC standings.
Their last two meetings in November and January ended in a 3-3 overtime draw and 2-1 loss for Harvard, respectively. Needless to say, this weekend’s game promises to be a close contest.
Considered the underdog by some, the Crimson is looking to learn from its previous mistakes and set the pace of game play early on in the series.
But defeating Princeton will be no easy task. The Tigers staged an impressive late-season run to capture the eighth and final home-ice slot, shutting out Harvard. Princeton has been ruling the ice of late, scoring 18 goals in its past three games—seven of which came during last Sunday’s performance against Brown.
To stifle the Tigers’ momentum, the Crimson will have to dictate play from the first drop of the puck and capitalize on power plays and third period chances, two of the weaker aspects of Harvard’s game this season.
“If we get off to a good start and really get on [Princeton] fast in their own zone, we should be able to shut down their momentum,” junior forward Michael Del Mauro said.
The Crimson plans to respond to Princeton’s dominant offense with resolute defense.
“Aggressive forechecks, getting out of the zone, catching the other team in transition, and finding odd man rushes will all be crucial,” junior defenseman Chris Huxley said. “But we have to focus on the defensive zone. We have to keep it in their zone. That way, they have no chance to score.”
Harvard also has an offensive force in freshman Louis LeBlanc. On Tuesday, LeBlanc, the team’s leading scorer, was named to the ECAC Hockey All-Rookie team.
LeBlanc has 21 points this season, and his 11 goals are a league-best for freshmen and sixth-best in the nation among rookies.
In the past three seasons, the Crimson is 2-4-1 head-to-head against Princeton but boasts the overall series record at 145-53-10.
Additionally, of the Ivy rivals’ two post-season encounters, Harvard has a 2-1 advantage.
The Crimson’s one postseason loss against the Tigers came in the 2008 ECAC League Championship, when then 15th-ranked Princeton outskated Harvard, 4-1, drawing the Crimson’s late-season comeback to a close.
Last season, Harvard similarly experienced a mid-winter slump and executed key victories towards the end of the season, entering the playoffs with high morale.
But much to fans’ dismay, the Crimson’s postseason ambitions unexpectedly hit a roadblock, as the Bears knocked Harvard out in the first round.
“Last year, we were a higher seed, and just took things for granted,” Huxley said. “Anyone can beat anyone on a given night. This postseason, we know we’re playing an offensively strong team. We’re just more prepared and need to get off to a strong start.”
This time around, the Crimson seeks a much higher finish.
“We’re coming into the first round of the playoffs with a great week of practice,” Del Mauro said. “We played hard last week, and if we really battle this weekend, I definitely think we can pull out two wins a row against Princeton.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The obstacles that are most difficult to overcome are often the ones that help us to grow the most.
No one knows this better than Pat Magnarelli.
The senior forward on the Harvard basketball team has suffered multiple injuries throughout his career with the Crimson and has been repeatedly forced to sit on the sidelines.
But he has become stronger for it.
“Would I have liked to be injured less? Yes,” he says. “But in the long run, it teaches me some good life lessons. It teaches perseverance and being able to overcome adversity.”
The adversity started early for Magnarelli, who was first injured in the preseason of his freshman year when he received a stress fracture in his vertebrae, limiting him to a back brace for most of the remaining season.
“Everyone comes in to college thinking they are on top of the world, and that it is going to be the same thing as high school,” he says, “but right off the bat freshman year, I got the back injury, and it taught me that college was going to be a lot different. It was going to be a lot harder.”
Yet Magnarelli had no idea of what further challenges were to come.
At the outset of his sophomore season, it was as if Magnarelli had never been off the court.
At his peak, he was averaging 10.8 points and 6.3 rebounds per game, ranking second and first on the squad, respectively.
But his promising season was cut short when he dislocated his kneecap at Dartmouth in the second Ivy League game of the year, an injury that would come to haunt him again.
After spending the rest of his sophomore season in street clothes, he dislocated the same knee two days before Harvard’s opening game against New Hampshire his junior year.
The injury required season-ending surgery that January and prevented him from stepping out on the court for the entire season.
“The two knee injuries really hurt me a lot, just because…I was finally playing again after missing freshman year, and it was nice to be back on the court,” he recalls. “Then I went down with the same injury twice in back-to-back years, so that was definitely disheartening for me.”
But Magnarelli didn’t give up hope. He always had his team to support him and to encourage him in his efforts to get back on the floor.
“I was still coming down every single day, going to practice, and doing rehab,” he says. “I would see the guys every day, and they were rooting me on during rehab and hoping that I would make it back on to the court...They thanked me a lot for sticking through it and coming down, so they were definitely very supportive.”
Magnarelli acknowledges how much his teammates inspired him to return. But by working to overcome his setbacks, he also served as an inspiration to his teammates.
“He’s a good example of what hard work and commitment can do, an example of perseverance,” co-captain Jeremy Lin says. “There aren’t many people who would have continued to work and continued to come back from all the injuries and setbacks that he had to face, so the fact that he’s been through it all and is still going strong is a testament to his character.”
“Everyone is aware of what he’s gone through,” sophomore guard Oliver McNally adds. “The fact that he still comes in and works really hard and rehabs to get back and have a successful year, it shows a lot about his dedication to the team and how much he wants to help us win games, which he definitely has this year.”
Magnarelli returned to action this season, much to the delight of his teammates and coach. The year has not been perfect—he was a victim of bad luck once again when he sprained his ankle in January, causing him to miss nine games. But the senior is now back, and happy to finish his career on the court rather than on the sidelines.
His perseverance has paid off. As part of this year’s squad, Magnarelli has helped to alter the Crimson record books. Harvard currently boasts a 20-6 overall and 9-3 Ivy record, and now holds the title for most wins in a single season by a Crimson team after last weekend’s victory over Yale.
Magnarelli cherishes this aspect of his journey the most.
“To be in this process of putting Harvard basketball on the map, trying to make tournaments and win the Ivy league, trying to get recognition around the country as a good basketball program, and being able to say, ‘I was on the team that really put Harvard basketball on the map,’ that really means a lot to me,” he says.
And even though he’s had limited time on the court, Magnarelli has helped this happen.
“It drives you crazy a little bit to see what we haven’t had when Pat hasn’t been healthy,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker says. “He has great instincts, great savvy, court awareness, he understands, and he’s not selfish…A lot of things go a lot easier and smoother when he is able to play for our team.”
“Coach Amaker calls me a stabilizer,” Magnarelli continues. “When I’m in the game, I have to make sure the team runs the offense and we do what we are supposed to do…I kind of do the little things.”
The role of the stabilizer, the man who brings everything back under control, is an appropriate one for someone who has triumphed over so much adversity in his time here.
Although he’s faced plenty of obstacles, Magnarelli has become stronger for it in the end, setting an example for anyone who has or will face similar challenges.
“It’s nice to always be able to win and have things always go your way. But it’s important to be able to face adversity and be able to lose and try to come back from that,” Magnarelli says.
“I’ve had my share of adversity here…and just being able to turn that around and put a positive spin on that is important for later in life. There is nothing I would change about my time here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While sporting events may not the biggest source of revenue at Harvard, several recent rivalry matchups allowed for serious fundraising for a very worthy cause.
During last month’s high-profile men’s basketball and ice hockey games against Ivy League foe Cornell, Crimson athletes dressed in old school Harvard gear made their way throughout packed crowds collecting donations for Partners in Health-Harvard for Haiti. The event, organized by the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee, raised over $5,000 for the cause.
The SAAC, led by senior softball player Melissa Schellberg, is comprised of representatives from most of the school’s varsity squads, including several head coaches. The group organizes community events and serves as a connection between athletes and Athletic Department administrators.
The fundraising at the February matchups was just one example of Crimson student-athletes’ more philanthropic activities. Over the last few years, several teams, players, and other SAAC members have been involved in everything from producing an educational math video for elementary students, to a bench press challenge benefitting the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation, to this fall’s “Miles for Myles” event in honor of the late NCAA President Myles Brand.
Check out athletes’ latest charity efforts at Harvard football's Blood Drive, held 1-6 p.m. Friday on the second floor of the Dillon Field House.

"Regretfully, we write to inform you that we are unable to accept you...." For most of us, as we contemplate the dismal job market ahead, this phrase is a nightmare. Unfortunately, even for Harvard Law students, it's apparently becoming a reality.
Boasting an 11 percent acceptance rate and an average LSAT score of 173, Harvard Law is often considered one of the best law schools in the world. With statistics like these, it seems like HLS students should have job offers lined up outside the door. But in an anonymous article in the Harvard Law Record, one disgruntled third-year HLS student reveals otherwise.
The student voiced frustration over the lack of jobs offers made to many third-year HLS students this year. Your initial reaction to this may be disgust—why should anyone who made it to Harvard Law be complaining?
But the disappointment is understandable. After years of sleepless nights spent studying and thousands of dollars in student loans, it's easy to see why any student would be dismayed to end his time at HLS with no job offer to show for it.
Certainly, the article doesn't deny the inherent privilege that comes with being a Harvard student. The author, who although clearly expresses frustration, also readily admits that "as Harvard graduates, we have more opportunities.  Most people encountering employment challenges in this economy are in worse positions than we are."
To other rejected 3Ls, the author offers these words of comfort: "I’m confident we will all land on our feet.  And I’m certain that the experience will be an opportunity for us to find strength we didn’t know we had." We appreciate your optimism, and we wish you luck. All the same, for our own sakes, let's hope the H-bomb regains its power by the time it's our turn to don Crimson caps and gowns.

That perfectly timed grab-a-banana-and-dash morning routine may need some minor tinkering for the next two days since the Quad shuttle stop will be moved a slight distance away from the Houses.
Through Friday, Quadlings will not be able to hop on the shuttle in front of Currier House. Instead, they'll have to go to Linnaean Street between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m. because of construction on Shepard Street.
If you walk out of Currier House, turn left, and walk down the driveway, you will arrive at the shuttle’s new temporary pickup spot, according to Bob Cassidy, the nighttime shuttle coordinator.

The broken window in Quincy House, which has caused a chunk of the dining hall to be blocked off by caution tape for over a month, has now been repaired.  However, we're still unsure what caused the damage.
Most students in the Quincy dining hall tonight speculated that the cold over J-Term had caused the window to crack, but some had more creative theories.
“A senior head-butted it,” declared Matthew J. O’Brien ’10.
“We assume that it was squirrels,” Ruthe J. Foushee ’12 said confidently. “With winds as fast as they’ve been, the squirrel either was blown or was thrown by an opossum.”
Several students said they were impressed by the speed with which four to six workers used a crane to install the large window at around noon today.
“That’s kind of a big thing to ship,” said Katherine J. Calle ’10, who claims that she was the first to discover the broken window and promptly alerted the House master, on Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
Foushee was more skeptical about the window’s repair. “We decided that they had to be doing something metaphorically or spiritually,” she told us. “There’s no way those little sticky things”—the suction cups used to hoist the glass into its new position on the second floor of Quincy—“could have held that entire thing up.”
“Clearly the guy at the bottom in the hard hat was a wizard,” Foushee said.
