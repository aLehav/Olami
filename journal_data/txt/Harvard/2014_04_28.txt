After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Disney has some fantastic villains. I feel fear when Maleficent curses Sleeping Beauty, I get angry when Jafar traps Jasmine inside the giant hourglass, and I cry every time Scar heartlessly throws Mufasa to his death. No matter the story, no matter the time and place, I always know whom I am supposed to root against, and I enthusiastically comply. This type of simplicity is something I’ve come to expect in a children’s film—and basically nowhere else.
Certainly there are some actual people who fit the mold of pure evil pretty well (just with more torture and mass murder and a little less singing about it)—Adolf Hitler immediately comes to mind as the most common example, with other genocidal leaders or serial killers not far behind. Those labels aren’t going away any time soon, and I’m fine with that.
But for the rest of the population, things are a lot less black and white. Just as girls need to stop looking for Prince Charming, we need to stop looking for the classic “bad guy.” It’s often more productive to call out actions as bad actions and policies as bad policies than it is to call out people as bad people. 
First, good people can do bad things. The Stanford prison experiment, which showed that everyday people given certain power can turn abusive, is a classic example. Corporate misconduct, high-profile scandals such as the firing of Joe Paterno, young people who were “well-liked” and had “bright futures” but made an awful decision one night—all these scenarios prompt commentary on how seemingly good people could have gotten caught up in illegal behavior.
While it’s easy to deem crimes as bad actions, it’s harder to determine whether a great friend, parent, or leader is a bad person when he or she commits a crime. There’s no clear line for how many bad actions one must commit before being labeled a bad person. And as current and former classmates of mine face potential criminal sentences for bad decisions made in difficult circumstances, I’m realizing that it’s a lot easier to characterize people as bad when you don’t know them personally and only know about one action that they’ve done.
In many cases, in fact, it’s simply ridiculous to call someone evil based on one bad mistake. From purely anecdotal evidence, it appears as if an alarmingly high percentage of the population has an ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend who is an “asshole” or “a terrible person.” By this logic, an alarmingly high percentage of the population are themselves assholes or terrible people, a conclusion equally unrealistic as it is depressing. No one is perfect, but at the same time most people aren’t awful.
On the other hand, in more serious cases, focusing on people rather than actions allows for past triumphs to overshadow current misdeeds, precluding proper condemnation of horrible behavior. Take the Stuebenville, Ohio rape case that gained much attention in late 2012.
Public outrage rightfully lambasted the media’s focus on the ruined futures of the “promising” students accused of sexually assaulting a 16-year-old girl instead of on the fact that the rape itself was so awful. Who knows, perhaps those were otherwise great guys (although it seems unlikely). It still doesn’t detract from the fact that they did something undeniably wrong. In addition to bringing to light many serious problems with how we react to rape, the incident is also evidence for the fact that attempting to evaluate a person’s worth as a whole can stop us from properly reproaching specific acts. Rape is awful, whether one is a serial rapist or a one-time offender, and it merits recourse and condemnation either way.
Further, people have different moral standards. It’s clearly unethical to knowingly violate a moral norm, but to some degree people can’t be held accountable for breaking rules they don’t hold to be valid. As Ricky Gervais once profoundly tweeted, “A Christian telling an atheist he is going to Hell is about as scary as a small child telling an adult they wont get any presents from Santa.”
And while I find Gervais’s atheism a little too rude and in-your-face, the message is still valid. It’s not fair to call atheists bad people, because any rules (or commandments) that they violate aren’t ones they believe to be true. This principle of course excludes those who don’t hold universally acknowledged evils like murder or rape to be wrong, but on issues such as religion where there is such profound disagreement, it’s important to avoid condemnation on a personal level. 
The same goes for liberals who claim that conservatives are evil and uncaring. Opposing a welfare program or a raise in the minimum wage doesn’t equate to hating the poor. Rather, it means one holds different value priorities or believes the policy will have counter-productive effects. If someone truly prioritizes the ideals of limited government and overall social welfare over absolute economic equality, then it makes little sense to demonize that person for not prioritizing equality over those other values. There are surely bad people who subscribe to any given political ideology, but on the whole, political differences are a result of differences in values, and it’s unproductive to judge someone according to values he or she doesn’t hold.
As hard as it is to determine the right course of action, it is harder yet to determine which people are good and which people are bad. Foregoing criticism is not the right answer, but criticizing action is preferable to criticizing people. Save your demonizing for our enemies of the animated sort.

The Undergraduate Council recently announced a partnership with Harvard Business School’s edX platform, HBX. The partnership, which involves UC promotion of HBX course offerings, will generate $1500 of revenue this year and a minimum of $3000 the following year. It is not surprising that the UC took the opportunity: The partnership comes in the same year that UC leadership sat down with University President Drew G. Faust and campaigned for $250,000 to fund student organizations. Though we understand that the UC must fund student groups out of an inadequate budget, this partnership raises a number of concerns. We urge the UC to maintain its impartiality in promoting organizations to students.
Among several other purposes, the preamble to the UC’s Constitution and Bylaws identifies “safeguard[ing] academic freedom and student rights” as one of its primary objectives. While advertising HBX courses does not necessarily infringe upon academic freedom or students’ rights, we do believe that the UC advertising certain programs over others violates an implicit impartiality in their promise to defend our rights and be our advocacy group.
The UC does seem to be aware of the implications of such a partnership, and UC President and Vice-President addressed the conflict of interest in an interview with Crimson editorial board staff writer Dhruv A. Pillai ’17. UC President Gus Mayopoulos ’15 said, “We feel like HBX is a great program—it would improve anyone’s educational opportunities, and so we feel comfortable partnering with them because we don’t see this as something that is only serving the UC, but is also a benefit to students.” Mayopoulos and UC Vice President Sietse Goffard ’15 went on to say that this partnership would not be a precedent for future partnerships with organizations not affiliated with Harvard.
Mayopoulos’s point that HBX is a fundamentally positive organization that would benefit students ignores certain issues in this scenario. Though the organization may be positive, why is HBX the only Harvard educational offering that is being promoted by the UC? Numerous other organizations on campus could be just as edifying and perhaps more valuable to Harvard undergraduates than an online business course.
Certainly the current arrangement is beneficial for all parties involved; HBX gets publicity, the UC receives badly needed funds, and Harvard undergraduates are provided with information about an opportunity to further educate themselves. The precedent that this partnership sets, however, is troubling. Should clubs that generate more revenue have the ability to receive UC sponsorship, thereby precluding other clubs from the same PR potential? If the UC can promote HBX in return for scheduled payments, it raises the possibility of future arrangements where the UC advertises for specific a cappella groups or service organizations.
Though the arrangement as it stands is fairly harmless, we urge the UC to not sign onto any analogous agreements with other Harvard organizations. The UC should hold itself to the highest standards of impartiality and equal opportunity for all organizations on campus.

If you received an acceptance letter from Harvard a month ago, congratulations! If you have offers from more than one school, even more congratulations! This is a privilege that the vast majority of high school graduates do not have. I have an important piece of advice for the most privileged among you—choose Harvard. It is the best school.
Harvard is the best school because the best students choose Harvard. Year after year, students who are accepted to Harvard and other schools pick Harvard over other schools in the majority of cases. When students are admitted to both Harvard and Yale, for example, 58 percent of students choose Harvard over Yale. The percentage is even more skewed in Harvard’s favor when compared with any other school. 
Why does this statistic matter, you ask, since these top schools already have top students? This statistic is particularly relevant because Harvard and its main competitors admit top students. Students with more than one offer are doubly validated as top candidates, and are more likely to be the “cream of the crop” even among the talented accepted student pool. So even though the top schools generally admit equally talented students, the choice of the “cream of the crop” group decides that the right tails of talent at each school may be uneven. Since Harvard beats all other schools in vis-à-vis comparison, it should have the largest share of cream of the crop students.
You will find that you can greatly benefit from having more talented classmates. First, Harvard (together with the aforementioned schools) is a competitive place. The greater your competition, the higher your bar for comparison, and the harder you will strive for success. Despite the competition, you will find it more common to cooperate rather than compete with your classmates, because these classmates will be your debate partners, project teammates, and future co-founders. You will benefit not just from cooperation or competition, but also from mere interaction with people with different interests and talents. Your classmates’ innovations and ideas can inspire you to apply them to your own work, through a magical process called knowledge spillover. Remember, you applied to the top schools partly because they offer you exposure to motivated and talented classmates. Even among the top schools, there can be differences in talent and motivation, and these differences count.
Even if you do not believe you will benefit from having more talented classmates, you should still value their opinions greatly. First, comparison between schools is elusive. It is difficult for any single individual to claim expertise on all aspects of two schools, so there are no true experts in the field. On these elusive questions, wisdom of the crowd dictates that best answers tend to come from aggregation of many people’s judgments, rather than the opinion of a single individual. Second, you should expect those who are accepted by more than one schools to form a particularly wise crowd, as they have made good decisions thus far to get accepted by Harvard. Choosing a school mattered as much to them as it does to you, so they must have invested a lot of time comparing schools, as you are doing now. It would be unwise to ignore their preference for Harvard when you deliberate your choice. 
My advice does not apply to you if you have some unconventional talent and ambition. If you want to be the next NBA starting point guard, you should probably pick University of Kentucky over Harvard. If you want to build the next billion-dollar startup, you should probably pick Stanford or UC Berkley over Harvard. Having excelled at these activities, you probably know a lot of people with the same talent and ambition, who faced or are facing the same college decision. In these cases, they are the “wise crowd” whom you should trust for their judgment.
If you don’t have such a wise crowd to rely on, don’t worry. Others have gathered the data and run the analysis. And they have delivered a verdict:
Choose Harvard.

As election season begins in earnest, conventional wisdom and the greenbacks emanating from the Koch brothers tell us that the Affordable Care Act will be central to the 2014 midterms. The Obama administration’s high-profile announcement of enrollment figures made clear that Democratic defense of the legislation—when it appears—will depend on out-spinning the GOP, replacing the Republican line that the health law has resulted in lost coverage and lost choice with a narrative about better, expanded coverage. Most Americans will likely react by muting the TV and retreating to whatever ideological corner feels most comfortable.
Before Americans throw up their hands, however, they might want to evaluate some of the assumptions underlying the Republican take on health reform, particularly its emphasis on choice. As in other features of GOP rhetoric, voters will find that what makes for a visceral ad does not necessarily gel with good policy.
Take the spot that the Koch-backed group Americans For Prosperity has begun running against vulnerable Democrats like Senator Kay Hagan of North Carolina. In all the ad’s iterations, the same actress declares that she detests political ads, but that “healthcare isn’t about politics…it’s about people.” She then accuses the ACA of causing millions of people to lose “their health insurance” and to lose access to “their own doctors,” and asserts that Americans are now “paying more, and getting less.”
A number of elements of the ad are noteworthy. For one, after the actress mentions “people,” the viewer expects her to say, “But, as an android, I can’t know what people want.” (Perhaps the Obama administration should enlist the androids of Janelle Monae’s artistic world as a corrective in its own ads.) More to the point, the spot progresses steadily from well-spun but accurate claims that the ACA’s minimum coverage requirements resulted in cancelled plans and changes in provider networks to the essentially untrue assertion that Americans are getting less bang for their buck in healthcare.
Some of this rhetoric about choice, then, is grounded in the facts. Because the ACA sets a number of basic services that all plans must cover, it led insurers to cancel plans that covered very little. People who could not get replacement plans with the same provider network, then, may have lost their preferred doctor. But the bit about “paying more for less” does not reflect reality; even those with higher premiums benefit from minimum coverage requirements, and with the law’s subsidies and prohibitions on discrimination based on health status, many Americans will pay less.
Even if some GOP facts are correct, however, the implications drawn from them could not be more wrong-headed. Take the idea that “stopping Obamacare” would restore choice to the American healthcare system. As Dr. Ezekiel Emmanuel, one of the law’s architects, pointed out in the New York Times, the presence of restrictive provider networks was a mainstay of the pre-reform healthcare landscape. This is because they perform some useful functions, like allowing insurance companies to negotiate for lower prices. ACA or no ACA, people will still have to deal with the doctors their insurers want them to see.
A larger problem with the GOP’s obsession with “choice” is that it presents choice, narrowly construed, as the primary metric by which to measure health reform. But what about access, or that other Republican bugaboo, cost? Before the ACA, Americans not only had limited choices in the form of selective provider networks, they also had less security even with those restrictions—no minimum coverage requirements, no limit on out-of-pocket costs, and no protection if their insurance company decided they had a pre-existing condition.  In terms of cost, the experience of New York’s insurance exchange has been a case-study in how limiting some choices can increase participation in the insurance market, increase competition, and reduce premiums.
Of course, none of this argument is meant to obscure the hardships that shifts in the insurance landscape can cause to families, or even the need for some course-corrections to ameliorate those burdens. But the real question is, how do we achieve universal, quality healthcare in the United States without the sort of minor restrictions stemming from the ACA—restrictions that differ little from what they were pre-reform and come with numerous improvements?
Let’s ask the self-proclaimed experts. In 2009, Representative Paul Ryan and Senator Tom Coburn, among others, proposed the “Patients’ Choice Act” to provide “universal and affordable health care for all Americans.” As the Washington Post’s Dylan Matthews noted, “it looked lot like Obamacare,” including state exchanges featuring plans with “standard health benefits,” bans on refusing coverage to those with preexisting conditions, what one economist called “a soft individual mandate,” and a tax credit like the ACA’s subsidy. To summarize, the Republican’s choice-centered health plan included the features of the ACA that have drawn ire for limiting choice, and the same benefits in return.
So the next time you see the Koch brothers’ android urging you to “stop Obamacare,” remember that healthcare is indeed about people, and that the same people who would have you believe that the ACA is a choice-limiting monstrosity had earlier reached the conclusion that its provisions were the best way to ensure both “patient choice” and “universal and affordable health care.”

U.S. Senator Rand Paul expressed concern for the current state of the Republican Party and the individual freedoms of the American people in a brief public address at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum at the Institute of Politics on Friday.
The forum was the last to be moderated by outgoing IOP Director C. M. Trey Grayson '94, who announced his resignation earlier this month.
Speaking for ten minutes to a room that had reached full-capacity, Paul—who is considered a contender for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination—described his political views as “libertarian-ish” and called for serious reconsideration of the policies set forth by the previous two U.S. presidents.
Paul, who is embarking on a Northeast tour that includes a stop in Maine to speak at the state’s Republican convention, questioned the constitutionality of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012, which allows terrorism suspects to be detained indefinitely on U.S. soil, and the U.S.A. PATRIOT Act, which was renewed by President Barack Obama in 2011 and allows for roving wiretaps and surveillance of suspected terrorists.
Paul said that he believes that in recent years Americans have begun to sacrifice their liberty for national security.
“I hope you join with me saying enough is enough,” Paul said. “We need to get our Constitution back.”
Before the event began, IOP president Eva A. Guidarini ’15 announced that the forum would be Grayson’s last, prompting a standing ovation as he entered the room.
Though Grayson lost a Republican primary race for a seat in the U.S. Senate to Paul in 2010, the two have remained friends since, according to Grayson. During the forum, Grayson said that his loss in Kentucky was, in a sense, a win because it led him to his current position.
In an interview before the forum, Grayson said that bringing Paul to speak at the IOP had been one of his goals ever since becoming the director three years ago.
“It’s special to me to have my old rival, but, more importantly, my fellow Kentuckian, be the last person of the forum I introduce before heading back to Kentucky,” Grayson said.
After his address, Paul answered questions from the audience for 40 minutes on topics ranging from tax cuts to abortion laws.
Although he avoided any explicit mention of his 2016 presidential prospects, he made several comments on controversial policies like the Affordable Care Act, which he said he would change if given the opportunity.
“President Obama says that you are not smart enough. You are not smart enough to choose your own insurance,” Paul said, adding that medical coverage should be a personal decision.
Referring to the future of conservatism in the U.S., Paul, who is also the son of three-time presidential candidate and former U.S. representative Ron Paul, told the audience that “the Republican Party will adapt, evolve, or die.” He also called for a diversification of registered Republican voters if the party is to succeed in future elections.
“If you go to a Republican event, it’s all white people—not because we’re excluding anybody. We just haven’t done a good enough job encouraging people to come into our party,” Paul said.

In efforts to raise awareness about campus issues, representatives from both The Diversity Report, a coalition of students of color, and Our Harvard Can Do Better, a campaign to change Harvard’s sexual assault policies, staged demonstrations throughout Visitas weekend.
Several members from Our Harvard Can Do Better gathered near the John Harvard statue and the Widener steps on Saturday holding signs for visiting parents and students that expressed their views on sexual assault issues and rape culture at the College.
One sign read, “My friend’s rapist goes to class with me.” Another read, “I don’t want to graduate with rapists.”
The demonstrations follow a complaint filed against Harvard by two individuals, including at least one member of Our Harvard Can Do Better, to the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights earlier this month, alleging that the College’s sexual assault policies violate Title IX.
Members of Our Harvard Can Do Better said that it was important for admitted students to be aware of Harvard’s sexual assault policies, of which they said the College did not sufficiently educate students, both enrolled and admitted.
“I think [sexual assault is] a large issue on campus...and [one that] certainly any student considering the school should be aware of,” said Jessica R. Fournier ’17, a co-organizer of Our Harvard Can Do Better.
Fournier said Our Harvard Can Do Better sought to give an honest image of a problem at the College, a goal she said aligns with the purpose of Visitas.
“This is not distracting from Visitas,” she said. “[Visitas] is supposed to give an image of what life is like here.”
Similarly, on Sunday evening, about 30 members of The Diversity Report, an organization which arose in response to issues raised during the “I, Too, Am Harvard” campaign and a town hall for Latino students, stood silently outside the Science Center with signs that spelled out “We Are Here.”
Statements were printed on the back of the signs expressing concerns that ranged from the lack of diversity on the Administrative Board and within the faculty to the lack of resources devoted to multicultural programming.
According to Sarah F. Cole ’16, a member and organizer of The Diversity Report, the goal of the demonstration was not to discourage prefrosh from attending Harvard.
“We really tried to reach out to [the prefrosh] and say we’re so happy here,” Cole said. “All predominantly white institutions have problems with diversity, but here at Harvard we're trying to find ways to make it an even better place.”
Noting that the current class of accepted students is one of the most diverse that Harvard has ever admitted, Cole said that the group intentionally staged its demonstration during Visitas to bring certain issues to the administration’s attention and shift the conversation away from college admissions to what happens when students actually arrive on campus.
“We had so many people saying, ‘Thank you, this is so important,’” Cole said. “Overall, it was really well-received and really validated what we’re doing.”
Admitted students who stopped by the Science Center plaza throughout the demonstration said that they appreciated the message The Diversity Report was sending to prospective students.
David Olvera-Sanchez, a prefrosh visiting from Los Angeles, said that the demonstration was especially important given some preconceptions regarding affirmative action programs.
Sara Surani, a prefrosh from Corpus Christi, Texas, echoed Olvera-Sanchez’s sentiments, adding that she didn’t realize how diverse Harvard was until she arrived on campus for Visitas.
“I think it’s great that students aren’t afraid to have a voice,” Surani said. “I feel like there are problems everywhere, but it’s great that they want to do something about it.”

Academics, students, and professors from a range of fields came together to discuss the current state and future of Greece’s government and economic sectors at the “Innovation for Greece” conference hosted by the Harvard Hellenic Society on Saturday.
James A. Robinson, a government professor at Harvard and co-author of “Why Nations Fail,” a book about the development and divergent paths of nations, served as a keynote speaker for the conference. He offered a framework for better understanding the Greek economy by examining the qualities and structures that separate successful, prosperous nations from unsuccessful, poor nations. Prosperity in long-term economic growth, he argued, is driven by innovation, new ideas, and creativity, all of which help raise productivity.
Robinson also distinguished inclusive and extractive institutions, noting that the United States is characterized by inclusive political institutions, which sport broad political rights, widely distributed political power, and intellectual property rights.
“What’s crucial about driving economic growth in the United States is that the political institutions and structures were inclusive, giving people incentives to invent and save,” he said, adding that these characteristics separate the U.S. from countries like those in Latin America.
Robinson concluded his talk with a brief discussion of his belief that Greece currently faces problems due to structural issues within the government that have triggered spillover effects. As an example, the creation of a homogenous economy with many barriers to the exit and entry of the economy may have resulted in fiscal problems in Greece, he said.
Two other speakers at the conference presented their personal projects that they said they hoped could one day be implemented in Greece to improve its future.
Stephen C. Liapis, a post-doctoral candidate in molecular biology, introduced the audience to a product he created as an undergraduate at Yale—a biology formula that he said contributes to superior crop growth and is sustainable and completely organic. Liapis said that Greece’s climate makes agriculture challenging in the country.
“This could be useful for Greece because Greece has little soil and little precipitation and consists of fragmental and small farms that cause poor nutrients and slow growth,” Liapis said. “Our formula enables plants to withstand environmental pressures and proves bigger crops and faster growth.”
The final speaker, Eugene J. Vaios ’14, said education in Greece needs to become “more personalized to make it more engaging” and more interactive to foster curiosity in students.
Vaios and his father launched Khan Academy Greek, an online classroom which has extended access to continuing education in Greece.  Vaios said he believes that “education can unlock the future of the country.”
Audience members said that they appreciated the creative and practical ideas presented by the speakers.
Maria-Alkistis Iliopoulou, a Cambridge resident and a participant in the conference last year,  said she felt that the products presented were “actual, high-level products, and not just ideas.”
“It’s inspiring to see that there are actually projects in place,” Iliopoulou said.

Undergraduates voted last week overwhelmingly in favor of supporting the reintroduction of American sign language courses for credit at the College, though just 18.5 percent of students voted on the referendum, which was the Undergraduate Council’s only one this term.
The referendum, which ran from April 21–24, garnered 1,135 affirmative votes—92 percent of the votes cast. However, the Council still must vote on legislation in order to take an official stance on the subject, since voter participation was well below 50 percent of the total number of undergraduates.
The results were shared in an email to UC members on Sunday and discussed further at the body’s general meeting Sunday night. In an interview after the meeting, UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos '15 said that the voter turnout, which was less than half of that of the fall 2013 election cycle, did not surprise him.
“I think that’s an appropriate number of students to vote on an issue like this. I don’t think it affects that many students because I don't think that many students would take this course,” he said, adding, “but I’m glad that the students who were moved by it chose overwhelmingly to vote for it.”
Julia B. Hyman ’15, who submitted the petition along with Erica X Eisen ’16, a Crimson Arts Chair, expressed a similar sentiment about the turnout and said she believes that not many people were “overly motivated” to vote on a single referendum question, even if they felt it was important.
Although Hyman said she “didn’t expect to get a huge number of votes,” she called the support that was shown “fabulous.”
UC Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15 confirmed that the Council and its rules committee will collaborate with the organizers of the petition to draft a position paper, so that the UC may vote on and officially adopt a stance at next week’s meeting, the last of the spring semester.
The intended measure, which Hyman described as “straightforward” and “low-risk” for the UC, will hopefully be passed, Goffard said.
UC leaders also announced at the meeting that Mather House Representative and Council Parliamentarian Manik R. Kuchroo '16 had resigned. Kuchroo was scheduled to come under review before the Council due to repeated absences, but stepped down from his position beforehand for personal reasons, according to Goffard. 
Kuchroo’s resignation is the fourth of its kind this semester. Two seats in Winthrop House and one each in Leverett and Mather currently remain unfilled, according to Goffard.
Even so, Goffard described the number of resignations as “very usual.” Referencing conversations with past Council leaders, he said that around five people leave the Council every year because of academic or personal priorities, so the string of resignations is “certainly not uncommon.”
The empty positions will be filled in the fall elections, which usually take place in November, Goffard said.

UPDATED: May 5, 2014, at 1:40 p.m.
Occupancy at the Science Center Plaza swelled above its usual levels last Friday afternoon when curiously large crowds milled about the tables, benches, and food trucks, poised to take part in a synchronized flash mob to raise awareness of the need to eradicate malaria.
At 4:10 p.m., the sound of a single voice pierced the air through a megaphone—“Ready, set, go!” At this signal, 200 students sprang to their feet and popped in their earphones. Over the next half hour, they fist-pumped, swordfought, and formed a massive human “M,” drawing the attention of passersby.
The flash mob was part of an international campaign to publicize Global Malaria Day. Dyann F. Wirth, director of the Harvard Malaria Initiative and the chair of the Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases at the Harvard School of Public Health, and the chief of staff for Ray Chambers, the United Nations Special Envoy for Malaria, were present. A total of nearly 350 students participated in similar mobs in Beijing and Harare, Zimbabwe.


A winning proposal of the Harvard Malaria Competition, Mob Malaria was funded by Chambers, Harvard’s Defeating Malaria initiative, and an organization called Malaria No More.
Mob Malaria co-founders Stephen A. Turban ’17 and Lily H. Zhang ’17 said they wanted to diverge from the sentimental approach of traditional global health campaigns for their malaria awareness project.
“Global health campaigns kind of just miss our generation, because I don’t think they really get at the core of what our culture is,” Turban said. “A lot of them are tragic—drawing on pain to get support and sympathy—but the culture is really about things people can get excited about.”
After meeting several times and considering ideas that ranged from Model United Nations-style conferences to zombie video games, Turban and Zhang decided upon what they called a more “shareable” project—a flash mob.
Various Harvard comedy groups helped Turban and Zhang bring their vision into fruition. Satire V publicized the campaign via social media, while On Harvard Time filmed the event and wrote the script for the audio file that guided the mob.
As they finalized their project, Turban and Zhang said they also decided to scale their efforts up to the international stage.
Initially, they said they tried to leverage Harvard’s institutional connections abroad.
“Then we realized that the whole point was to involve students. So we ended up connecting with them directly,” Zhang said.
Ultimately, in Zimbabwe, two directors and 30 volunteers enlisted local doctors to speak about malaria, tailoring the event to malaria prevention and other concerns of the local population, Zhang said.
Meanwhile, the director of the mob in Beijing designed a separate T-shirt and other promotional items for the event, which was aired on CCTV. Another group, in Changsha, China, also participated.
Turban and Zhang said they were pleased that their foreign counterparts took the campaign and “made it their own.”
Footage of all three mobs will be compiled into a YouTube video that Turban said will be available for viewing within the next week and a half.
“The success of Mob Malaria would support the idea that ‘fun’ is a great way to approach global health,” Zhang said.
Participants in Mob Malaria said they believed the energy of the mob was contagious and that the event united the community.
Blessing Jee ’17, who took part in the mob, said her experience was “educational” and empowering.”
“They did a great job integrating facts, history, and the sobering impact of malaria on the world with fun. I learned so much about malaria I didn’t know before,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With an 11-10 victory over Ivy League rival Yale on Saturday, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team finished its regular season with possession of the Ancient Eight title.
The No. 16 Crimson (9-5, 5-1 Ivy) entered the fourth quarter tied with the 13th-ranked Bulldogs (9-4, 3-3), 9-9, but two quick goals gave Harvard the lead it needed to hold on to win the game.
Strong play by junior goaltender Jake Gambitsky, who recorded five saves and gave up only one goal in the fourth quarter, was essential for the Crimson in these waning moments.
“Jake was the biggest difference in the fourth quarter,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “When it mattered most, he was the best player on the field.”
With the win and the program’s first Ivy League title since 1990, the Crimson will host the conference tournament next weekend.
Harvard’s sole league loss this year came against Penn, and that matchup was decided in sudden-death overtime.
“I am so proud of our players,” Wojcik said. “They have worked so hard for this, and winning the Ivy League championship is a testament to them and how much they’ve done.”
Harvard struck first in the match, as sophomore attackman Deke Burns caught a pass from classmate Devin Dwyer to give Harvard the advantage.
But Bulldog senior attackman Brandon Mangan responded quickly to tie the game, and proceeded to convert again, putting Yale up by one.
Co-captain Peter Schwartz then drew a Bulldog penalty after driving for a shot, and followed that up with a goal, assisted by Dwyer. After a quick faceoff win, sophomore midfielder Mark Glicini tallied for Yale to put his team back up. Dwyer notched his third assist a few minutes later, finding senior midfielder Daniel Eipp to tie the game heading into the second quarter.
At this point, Gambitsky had made six crucial saves to keep Harvard in the game. The Crimson had won only two of seven faceoffs, and was losing the possession battle, but still went into the break tied.
“Jake came up clutch for us,” co-captain defenseman Joe Petrucci said. “He’s built up a lot of confidence throughout the year, and he is really the backbone of our defense.”
Dwyer got his fourth assist on a pass to sophomore attackman Will Walker to start the second period. Two minutes later, sophomore attackman Ian Ardrey also notched a goal, sprinting around the goal for a diving shot, putting Harvard up by two.
But it was not long before the Bulldogs answered, as Mangan scored again, and then junior attackman Conrad Oberbeck tied the game.
The Bulldog defense seemed unable to control itself, giving up a total of six penalties before the end of the second quarter. Junior attackman Murphy Vandervelde scored on two of these, shooting from about 12 yards out each time, giving the Crimson a two-goal lead heading into the half.
Yale scored man-up to start the third period, but sophomore long-stick midfielder Jack Breit scored his fourth goal of the season, assisted by Burns, to answer for Harvard. Burns followed his assist with a goal of his own, giving the Crimson its largest lead of the day, 9-6.
Two more goals by Oberbeck narrowed the lead, and then Bulldog junior midfielder Shane Thornton tied the contest going into the fourth quarter.
Eipp and sophomore midfielder Sean McDonagh scored for Harvard, the latter of whom was assisted by Dwyer. This marked Dwyer’s sixth assist of the game, a career-high for the sophomore attackman, who will finish the season leading the Ancient Eight in assists with 30.
“[Dwyer] is a great player because he makes everyone around him better,” Wojcik said. “He is able to really see the field and it is a special skill that he has. His distribution really made our entire offense better.”
Over the course of the last 1:45, when the Crimson got the ball back with a two-goal advantage and were looking to ice the game, the team began to struggle. Harvard gave the ball back to Yale three times in the final stretch, one of which resulted in a goal.
But the Crimson held on, largely thanks to two key saves by Gambitsky. The goaltender finished with 14 saves on the day, his most since a March 8 victory over Georgetown. Saturday’s contest marked the fifth straight game in which Harvard gave up 10 goals or fewer, four of which have been key conference games. The Crimson has conceded the fewest in-conference goals of any Ivy League team this season.
“This was a complete team win,” Petrucci said. “We played hard, we fought, and we put ourselves in position at the end to win.... This senior class has put in four years of hard work, and it’s an unbelievable feeling to win the Ivy League championship. No one can take this away from us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
After successfully clinching a spot in the Ivy League tournament in its last match, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team returned to Harvard Stadium to take on Dartmouth and attempt to move up to the two seed before the start of the postseason.
In a game which saw both teams go on scoring streaks in the first half before experiencing some difficulty scoring in the second stanza, the Crimson (9-6, 4-3 Ivy) suffered a tough 9-8 loss to the Big Green (6-8, 3-4) on Senior Night despite outshooting Dartmouth 32-19.
“They face guarded well,” Harvard coach Lisa Miller said. “They shut off Marisa [Romeo] and Audrey [Todd] at different times…. We saw two of our leading scorers and leader on attack being shut off, so that means other people need to pick up the slack and put the ball away…. We just didn’t finish.”
Dartmouth senior attacker Lindsey Allard scored the winning goal with 1:16 left to clinch the game in the last home performance for Crimson seniors Chelsey Newman, Kyleigh Keating and Chloe Soukas. The loss prevented Harvard from moving up in the Ivy League standings and the Crimson remains in third place in the Ancient Eight.
The first half was a tale of two stories as both Harvard and Dartmouth went on long runs marked by defensive lapses by the opposing team to score a combined 11 goals in the period.
Harvard  got off to an early start in the game, as Newman scored an unassisted goal three minutes into the first period to give the Crimson a lead. A minute after the opening goal, Harvard doubled its lead via a goal by freshman midfielder Megan Hennessey on an assist by classmate Romeo.
The Big Green responded with a sophomore midfielder Jaclyn Leto goal off of a free position shot to spark the away team’s offense and get them off and running.
The attack continued with senior attacker Liz Calby breaking down the Crimson defense close to the crease to score an unassisted goal and level the score.
Attackers Ingrid Hermanson and Samantha Schiff put Dartmouth on top 4-2 with a goal each a minute after leveling the score, once again taking advantages of lapses by the Harvard defense.
Calby ended the run by scoring 10 minutes later, establishing a 5-2 lead with 10 minutes left in the period.
Despite struggling to contain the break apart the Dartmouth possession, the Crimson responded with a run of its own before the end of the half to regain control of the match.
The freshmen started the attack, with Hennessey and Romeo both scoring unassisted goals in a span of 40 seconds.
The seniors followed, as Newman and Keating each scoring before the half to give Harvard a 6-5 lead.
Despite leading by just one goal, the Crimson had multiple opportunities to extend its lead before the half, having outshot Dartmouth 22 to nine while forcing nine turnovers out of the Big Green.
“When you outshoot a team 22 to nine at halftime and you’re only up by one it’s obviously not a good performance.” Miller said.
The second half started on a positive note for Harvard, as sophomore attacker Alexis Nicolia scored an unassisted goal to continue the scoring streak for Harvard before Calby countered with her third goal of the night five minutes into the period.
Dartmouth continued to dominate the possession battle, keeping the ball away from the Crimson while also winning the ground ball battle nine-to-five.
The scoring drought finally broke when Romeo scored her league-leading 46th goal of the year to put Harvard up 8-6.
The match would experience yet another scoring drought with neither team being able to break through for the next eight minutes until Calby scored her fourth goal to close the gap to one.
Dartmouth would use this to spark the game deciding run, as Leto would score off of a free position shot before Allard’s goal would put the Big Green up for good.
Despite the loss, the Crimson will continue to play in the Ivy League tournament in Princeton, N.J., as the three seed. The Crimson will face second seed Penn as it starts its quest for the Ivy League postseason title. Miller believes the loss can be used as an example of what the team will encounter at the tournament.
“If we learn from [the loss] and get better, [this loss] can be used as a good tool.” Miller said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Coming off of a weekend that saw each team face elite competition at the Clemson Invitational and Lightweight Invitational, the Radcliffe heavyweights and lightweights both traveled to familiar rivals for dual meets.
LIGHTWEIGHTS
A week after knocking off then-no. 1 Stanford and claiming the top rank for itself, the Black and White traveled to Princeton, N.J. this weekend to face No. 3 Princeton on Lake Carnegie for the Class of 1999 Cup. 
The Radcliffe first varsity eight was more than ready for the challenge, building upon an open-water lead throughout the second half of the race to finish 10 seconds in front of the Tigers.
With the victory, the top boat for the Black and White has now beaten its two closest competitors rankings-wise in back-to-back weeks.
“I feel like this year we are all extremely driven as a boat,” junior Adelaide Backer said. “Everyone is just so hungry to get that open water and to not give up any seconds in the race just because we are already ahead: building on that margin sends a message.”
In the second varsity race, Radcliffe made its move early and continued to extend its lead, finishing 15 seconds ahead of Princeton with a time of 7:29.7.
The Black and White varsity four completed the sweep for Radcliffe in style, finishing in 8:28.1, more than 45 seconds faster than their Tiger counterparts.
“It feels pretty awesome [to beat Stanford and Princeton back-to-back],” Backer said. “Our whole team is really excited, but we are still all going to be really on our game going into the next few weeks of training because we were on top last year at this point in the year as well and Stanford ended up beating us at IRAs. We don’t want to rest on our accomplishments, we want to keep improving and keep getting stronger so that we are able to maintain our title as the top crew in the country.”
HEAVYWEIGHTS
On Saturday, No. 16 Radcliffe traveled to New Haven, Conn. to race No. 11 Yale on the Housatonic River.
The Bulldogs got the best of the Black and White in the varsity eight, the premier race of the day, finishing in 6:12.1 to beat Radcliffe by five seconds and win the Nathanial H. Case Cup for the third straight year.
The second varsity eight race came down to the wire, as the Black and White edged out Yale by a few seats to win by a second. Radcliffe took an early lead, and, while the Bulldogs were able to move back into the race in the final sprint, it was too little, too late for the home squad.
“The big thing about the Yale course is the turn,” senior Eliza Flint said. “We were on the inside of the turn, so our main goal was to get out early and gain as much as possible before the turn. We were able to do that and it really set us up for a nice position coming out of the turn.”
The Radcliffe varsity four followed in the footsteps of the second varsity eight, barely beating out the Bulldogs for a two-second victory in the second and final race of the day for the Black and White.
Yale earned a win in the second varsity four with a five-second margin, and beat two Radcliffe boats in the third varsity eight race to round out the day.
“It was great having at least two NCAA boats win this weekend,” Flint said. “The [varsity four] had a fantastic race; they were down until the last 750 meters before they just walked through Yale. Having two of those three boats win really puts us in a great position to take everything that we have learned from the past few weeks of racing and prepare for the Ivy Championships.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s water polo team saw its season come to an end this weekend at the CWPA Championship at Bucknell. The team entered the tournament as the seventh seed, and finished the weekend 1-2, coming in seventh place overall.
HARVARD 17, CONNECTICUT COLLEGE 7
The Crimson (15-20, 2-3 CWPA South) wrapped up its season with the team’s only win of the weekend over the Camels (15-10). During the game, Harvard never gave up the lead, going ahead immediately and protecting the advantage throughout.
The first half of the game belonged to the Crimson, as co-captain Shayne Price and freshman attacker Melissa Balding propelled the offense. Earlier this week, Balding was named the CWPA Southern Division Freshman of the Year.
At the end of the first eight minutes, the team was up, 6-3, after Price and Balding each had a pair of goals. The offense kept rolling in the second quarter, outscoring the Camels, 4-3, to go into halftime with a 10-6 lead.
Coming out of the break, Harvard’s defense held Connecticut College’s offense to only one goal over the course of the final 16 minutes of play. A 4-0 run by the Crimson sealed the team’s victory and sent it into seventh place for the championship overall.
“It’s good to be able to end the season with a victory, because the last thing we are going to remember is a win,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “It was the last time this group will be playing together…so there was a lot to play for in this last game and to enjoy.”
BUCKNELL 12, HARVARD 11
This contest marked the third time this season that the two teams have matched up against each other, and the third time the Bison (13-12, 3-2) has come out victorious.
The game began as a tight one, with each team coming out and scoring two goals early in the first quarter, but was a goal scored by Price with 19 seconds left in the opening quarter that put the Crimson ahead.
Harvard’s lead would not stand for long, as two goals from Bucknell attacker Eleanor Marrs put the Bison up, 4-3. Balding answered with a goal of her own to knot the score in the second period.
“I think that games that come down to the end are compiled of a lot of little things that add up throughout the game,” Price said. “That’s the sport. It comes down to a call the ref makes, or a shot that doesn’t fall—which are things that are out of our control.”
The back and forth nature of the game continued up to halftime, as the teams traded scores twice before the second quarter came to a close. A last-second goal by Bucknell gave the team a one-goal advantage going into the second half.
As the teams battled in the third, Harvard saw goals from Price, junior attacker Victoria Frager, and sophomore attackers Charlotte Hendrix and Yoshi Andersen. But every goal the Crimson got past the Bison net was countered, bringing the score to a tie at 11 with a little more than a minute left in the game. A last second effort by Bucknell’s offense got a goal past Harvard goalie Ariel Dukes, cementing the victory and a berth in the fifth-place game for the Bison.
PRINCETON 12, HARVARD 6
Coming into the game ranked second in the tournament pool and eleventh in the NCAA, the Tigers (31-1, 5-0) had won each of their three previous matchups against the Crimson.
Saturday’s game followed the same storyline as the others, with Princeton’s physical offense overpowering Harvard’s defense early in the game and continuing to do so throughout the contest.
It took a quarter for the Tigers to get their bearings offensively, but a 4-0 run going into halftime put the Crimson down by six goals going into the break.
Harvard broke through in the second half, outscoring Princeton 2-1 in the third quarter. But the offensive effort from the Crimson was too little, too late, as the Tigers went on to win the fourth quarter 3-2 on their way to taking the game.
Balding led the team in scoring with her fifth hat trick of the season, while Price chipped in two goals in the losing effort.
“We didn’t beat any of the teams that were ahead of us,” Minnis said. “This year we lost a lot of close games to good teams and fought hard in most games. It is what it is. I’m proud of this group.”

Though spring showers may have postponed the Saturday doubleheader between Harvard baseball and Dartmouth, the two teams faced off at Biondi Park in Hanover, NH for some Sunday action that saw the Crimson drop both sides of the doubleheader. 
The Crimson (11-26, 5-13 Ivy) had a tough time stringing together a few hits against the Big Green (13-19, 9-9) in the first afternoon game, falling 4-2 in seven innings. Making the final start of his career, senior pitcher Danny Moskovitz kept Harvard in the second game, but Dartmouth shortstop Matt Parisi blasted a walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth to seal the 3-1 victory for the Big Green.
With Saturday’s games having been pushed back, the Crimson will finish up their season and the planned four-game set against Dartmouth at O’Donnell Field on Tuesday afternoon.
DARTMOUTH 3, HARVARD 1
Moskovitz was brilliant in the early stages of game two. The right-hander didn’t allow a baserunner until the fourth inning, and the Big Green did not score until the sixth.
“Danny threw really well today…he kept his composure well,” said junior right fielder Brandon Kregel. “He really flourished from the middle to the end of the season.”
However, to that point, the Crimson had only managed a single run of its own.
“We had the defense behind us in this one, and [junior center fielder] Mike Martin did a really good job tracking down some balls,” Kregel said. “But even though every inning [on offense] we would get a runner on, we just couldn’t get the ball rolling to score some runs.”
With the score knotted at one heading into the eighth, junior Tanner Anderson took over on the hill for Harvard in relief of Moskovitz.
After escaping a jam and leaving Dartmouth runners on the corners in his first frame, Anderson gave up an infield single to start the ninth. But this time the reliever wouldn’t be able to avoid the big hit.
Batting in the eight-spot, Parisi blasted the first pitch he saw over the left field fence for his third hit of the game and the walk-off victory.
“The scores were close [in both games], and it’s really frustrating knowing that one extra hit or one extra made play could change the outcome of the game,” said senior utility man Carlton Bailey. “But baseball is a game of failure, and we’ll definitely be ready to play Tuesday.”
DARTMOUTH 4, HARVARD 2
Although the Crimson traveled to Hanover at the bottom of the Red Rolfe division, eliminated from postseason competition, the Big Green sat just a game and a half back of division-leading Yale.
Indeed, the home team played like the group with something to play for in this contest. Although the Crimson outhit Dartmouth, nine to six, the Big Green took advantage of three Harvard errors to score a run in each of the second through fifth innings for the 4-2 victory.
“We didn’t play defense very well, and there were opportunities with runners in scoring position that we didn’t execute,” Kregel said. “We didn’t handle the ball well and hit when we needed to.”
The Crimson took an early 1-0 lead when junior catcher Ethan Ferreira, junior left fielder Jack Colton, and sophomore third baseman Mitch Klug started the top of the second inning with three straight hits.
But defensive miscues led to unearned runs scored by Dartmouth in the bottom halves of the second, third, and fifth innings to go along with another run in the fourth. And though Harvard had at least one hit in every inning but the third, the group could only muster two runs of support for sophomore starter Sean Poppen.
The 6’3” right-hander, who leads the team with 57.1 innings pitched for the season, threw five innings of five-hit ball and only allowed one earned run in the loss.
“In baseball, it’s a crazy thing how you can have that many hits and only scratch across two runs,” Bailey said. “It all comes down to the timely hits with runners on base and in scoring position. We tended to…get one guy on and then not advance him any further.”
Junior righty Matt Timoney threw a scoreless inning in relief, and senior designated hitter Carlton Bailey, junior center fielder Mike Martin, and Klug had two hits apiece in the contest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, the Harvard women’s golf team headed to the Baltusrol Golf Club in Springfield, N.J. to compete for the Ivy League championship.
The Crimson was coming off of a strong outing at the Brown Invitational two weeks ago, in which the squad took first place in a field that included two opponents from the Ancient Eight and a number of other local teams.
That momentum seemed to carry into this weekend’s events, as the team posted a total score of 900 strokes to win the title, coming in a full 21 shots ahead of second-place Princeton.
The victory marks Harvard’s third consecutive title and its fifth all-time. The Crimson’s three-peat is the first in Ivy League women’s golf history.
“[Junior] Brenna Nelsen and I have been on the team for all three of those years,” junior Tiffany Lim said. “So we’re very lucky to have witnessed all of these wins, and we’re really excited.”
Freshman Anne Cheng played a significant role in setting the tone early on for Harvard, shooting two under par in the first round. Her score of 70 was the best of any golfer on Friday.
Cheng’s teammates posted competitive scores on the first day as well. Sophomore Christine Lin and captain Bonnie Hu both posted 75 to put Harvard in the lead at 297 after one round.
Saturday proceeded in a similar fashion for Harvard. Cheng came through for the team again, finishing the second round at even-par 72.
“This week, my putting was a little better than it usually is,” Cheng said. “I was making a lot of medium length putts that I may not always make.”
In keeping with her performance thus far this season, Lim also had a strong day for the Crimson. She started the round with a birdie on the first hole, and she continued to swing well throughout the day, putting up three more birdies and a score of 70.
Cheng and Lim’s individual efforts led the team to another score of 297, putting it at a total of 594—18 strokes ahead of Princeton and Yale.
Sunday’s round saw higher scores across the board, which helped take some of the pressure off of Harvard as it looked to seal its victory.
While the Crimson’s scores increased as well, Harvard’s team play was still enough to solidify the top spot in the standings. Rounds in the mid-70s from Cheng, Lim, and Hu gave Harvard a score of 306, the best score of any team in the third round, sealing its Ancient Eight championship.
“The competition in the Ivy League has just been getting higher and higher every year,” Lim said. “We’ve had to shoot lower and lower scores just because the competition has been getting so strong. We’re continually looking to improve our own games and see how we do at Ivies every year, and we’ve been doing pretty well.”
After a weekend of strong putting and low scores, Cheng walked away as the individual champion. Her score of 217 was enough to hold off a late run from last year’s champion, Princeton’s Kelly Shon, who carded a 70 on Sunday to surge to second place after starting the day tied for eighth.
Cheng is the third Crimson golfer in program history to finish first in the tournament—the first since Hu in 2012—and was named Ivy League Rookie of the Year.
“It’s such a big honor to receive [that] award,” Cheng said. “[Sunday] was overall a happy day with many surprises.”
This is the third time in as many years that a Harvard woman golfer has received this honor, with Cheng following in the footsteps of current teammates Lin and Lim.
Other individual players were recognized for their performances at the tournament. Lim joined Cheng as a top-five finisher, earning both of them a first-team All-Ivy selection.
The top-10 finishers earned second-team All-Ivy honors, and Hu and Lin earned this distinction. Hu has earned All-Ivy recognition for the past three years.
From here, the Crimson will advance to the NCAA Regionals.
“The whole team is really excited, and we’re really excited to get ready for Regionals,” Lim said. “We feel like we have a real chance to be competitors this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Competing in its final tournament of the season, the Harvard men’s golf team capped its 2013-2014 campaign with a third-place finish at the Ivy League Championships this weekend. The Crimson shot an 895 over three rounds, finishing 55 strokes over par.
 
Nonetheless, while the team fell short of first, one Harvard golfer stood above the rest. In his final match as a member of the Crimson, captain Theodore Lederhausen brought home the individual Ivy title, shooting a five-over 215. He finished tied atop the leaderboard with Brown’s Nelson Hargrove.
 
“[Lederhausen's] game was really sharp,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “His distance control with his irons was the best that I’ve kind of seen [from] anybody. He really had control over his approach shots onto the greens, which made scoring so much easier than most people found it.”
 
Fresh off his second-place finish at the Yale Invitational last weekend, Lederhausen shot a 72 in both of the first two rounds, before finishing with a one-over 71 on Sunday. With the win, the senior became just the third golfer in team history to take first place at the Ivy League Championships and the first since 1998.
 
After winning its last two tournaments, the Crimson carried its momentum into the first round at Baltusrol Golf Club on Friday. Harvard shot a 299 on the day, putting the team in a tie atop the leaderboard with Dartmouth.
 
Saturday, the Crimson had to fight off difficult weather conditions, including three rain delays occurring after most of the other teams had already finished. Harvard still bested its opening round score by six strokes with a 293, but the score actually sent the team in the opposite direction, as the Crimson fell two spots to third.
 
“We got a little bit of a bad break with [the weather],” Lederhausen said. “But the second day, we still played pretty well.... Guys played pretty well on a tough course.”
 
Columbia seized control of the leaderboard on Saturday with a four-under 276 performance in the second round. The Lions entered the day three strokes behind Harvard, but with four of its players shooting at or under par on the day, they leaped well ahead of the Crimson and 11 strokes ahead of Yale, who moved into second.
 
“Columbia had a round in the second round that I didn’t think was out there for a team,” Rhoads said. “I thought one or two players could have that strong of a round at one time from one tee, but to have four out of the five do it when they needed it the most, [that] was an amazing performance.”
 
Sunday brought little change to the leaderboard, as the three sides cemented their positions amidst a rainy final round. Harvard posted its highest stroke total of the tournament, as did Columbia and Yale, with the three shooting a 303, a 303, and a 304, respectively.
 
After Lederhausen, freshman Robert Deng notched the Crimson’s next best score at the tournament. The rookie shot a 14-over 224, highlighted by a two-over 72 in the second round, finishing tied for 13th.
 
Also making his first appearance in the conference championship, freshman Kendrick Vinar posted an 18-over 228, joining junior teammate Akash Mirchandani in a tie for 18th place. Vinar shot a 73, a 76, and a 79 over the weekend, while Mirchandani notched a 78, a 73, and a 77.
 
Rounding out the Harvard squad was sophomore Rohan Ramnath. The sophomore won an individual title his last time out at Yale, but he could not keep his hot streak going this weekend. Ramnath shot a 28-over 238, putting him in a tie for 35th.
 
Although the Crimson failed to earn its third straight victory of the season, its third-place finish marks the best result Harvard has earned at the Ivy Championships since 1996. In the tournament’s 88-year history, the Crimson has only has won the title once—in 1968.
 
On the year, Harvard won two team tournaments, three individual titles, and finished in the top four at all but one of its eight competitions. Rhoads said that it has certainly been an extremely successful season.
 
“To set program records and see results is really fun and satisfying, but even more [satisfying is] the foundation that we’ve continued to lay,” Rhoads said. “With the core of guys that we have on the team, we’re extremely deep, we’re very, very talented…and I think we’ve set ourselves up for next year and the years to come to be a really strong force.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
After the first doubleheader of the weekend was postponed due to rain, Harvard’s softball team headed to Dartmouth to play a crucial doubleheader on Sunday. The Crimson split the games, winning the first game 2-0 in the eighth inning and losing the second on a walk-off solo home run in the bottom of the seventh inning. 
The Crimson will make up Saturday’s games at home tomorrow.
DARTMOUTH 2, HARVARD 1
The Crimson jumped out to an early lead against Dartmouth, but were unable to hold on in the second game of the doubleheader.
Junior infielder Emily Gusse doubled to left field in the top of the second inning, driving home junior Adrienne Hume for the first run of the game.
The duo of junior Laura Ricciardone and sophomore Morgan Groom were able to hold the Big Green from scoring for the first five innings. In the sixth, however, an error by co-captain Shelbi Olson allowed a runner to advance to second and eventually score on a Big Green single.
The Crimson was unable to plate a runner in the top of the seventh, giving the ball back to Ricciardone with the game still tied. Kelsey Miller, the first batter she face in the bottom of the seventh, belted a solo shot to give Dartmouth the walk-off victory.
HARVARD 2, DARTMOUTH 0
In the first game of the doubleheader, Ricciardone shut down Dartmouth for eight innings, giving the Crimson enough time to finally get on the board in extras.
The story of the game was the pitching, with the Ricciardone and the Big Green’s Kristen Rumley only allowing nine base runners in the first seven innings. The two also combined for 13 strikeouts.
In the top of the eighth however, junior Katherine Lantz broke the tie with a double to right that plated one Crimson runner. A wild pitch the next at bat let another runner score giving Harvard a two-run lead.
Ricciardone took it from there, giving up a single in the bottom of the eighth, but striking out the next two batters and getting a ground out to earn her 18th win of the season.

With the match between the Harvard women’s tennis team and Dartmouth tied at three points each, all eyes were on the third singles match. After losing the first set 7-6, freshman June Lee was locked in a tight battle with Dartmouth freshman Jacqueline Crawford to decide the match. 
Lee raced out to a 4-1 lead and managed to take the second set, 6-4, to tie up the match, but fell victim to cramps and ultimately could not take down her Dartmouth counterpart.
After Lee went up, 4-1, for the second time in the third set, Crawford broke Lee to make the match 4-2, and then won 15 of the next 16 points on her way to a 6-4 victory to give Dartmouth the win on Senior Day.
“She gets a lot of balls back and so do I, so all our points were very long, and our whole match was very long as well,” Lee said. “[The overall match] was 3-3 and I was the last match on. I really wanted us to win and end on a good note, so I just kept fighting, and ended up pulling out the second set. Unfortunately, then I started cramping and [Crawford] just doesn’t give up. She found her way back in that set and ended up winning, but it was a really good match overall.”
Harvard started the match off on a high note, with wins at second and third doubles giving the Crimson the doubles point and an early 1-0 lead in the match. Freshman Spencer Liang and Lee won in the second spot with an easy 8-5 victory, while senior Hannah Morrill and sophomore Monica Lin clinched the point with an 8-6 victory over Dartmouth’s Katherine Tan and Taylor Ng on the first court.
“We started pretty strong with doubles,” Lee said. “I think we were really motivated to start off well, and also we’ve all been working pretty hard on doubles, so we all felt pretty confident. In the singles, like usual, everyone fought super hard, but the Dartmouth girls didn’t give up either. They fought hard, and it was a tough match.”
However, once the singles matches started, the Crimson simply could not match up to Dartmouth. The Big Green won four of six singles matches in dramatically close fashion to upset 53rd-ranked Harvard and finish with a 4-3 conference record, good for fourth in the Ivy League. After a loss to Yale last weekend, the Crimson finished with a 3-4 record, landing just behind Dartmouth at fifth in the Ivy standings.
Harvard’s only two singles’ wins came early in the contest, as sophomore Amanda Lin swept Dartmouth’s Julienne Kong at sixth singles right off the bat to put Harvard up, 2-0. After Katherine Yau rallied for Dartmouth at the top position to defeat Liang, 6-1, 6-3, freshman Amy He put Harvard within one win of taking the match at fourth singles.
He downed Dartmouth’s lone senior, Melissa Matsuoka, in a 6-0, 6-3 victory to give the Crimson a 3-1 lead with just three matches to go.
Monica Lin was bested by Dartmouth freshman Taylor Ng in her sixth Ivy League win at second singles, 6-4, 6-2, while Morrill could not come back against Akiko Okuda after losing the first set, 6-3, and lost the match after dropping the second set, 7-5.
With the match tied up, everything fell to the third singles match, where Crawford was on her way to the deciding victory.
Despite the loss in their final match of the season, blue-chip freshmen like Liang and Lee foreshadow a bright future for a young Crimson squad that only graduates one senior, Morrill, from the starting lineup.
“The whole team knows that hard work pays off,” Lee said. “We’ve seen that throughout the season, like when we beat Clemson and Houston and all our other wins, so I think overall it was a good season. There were definitely some ups and downs, but I think that comes with the territory. We definitely learned from our downs and we bounced back and were pretty resilient, so I’m excited for next semester.”

Happy Monday!
Today marks the last Monday of classes for this year, as well as the last day of Visitas. As you bid your prefrosh goodbye and look ahead to reading period, we hope you reflect on the past year, as well as the past weekend. Visitas is like a movie trailer—all the highlights of Harvard condensed, without any of the difficulties or problems of all the things in between. Selling Harvard to the undecided prefrosh kind of helps one remember why they came here in the first place. And that’s always nice. Until you remember some of your class here involve “midterms” scheduled the week before finals begin. Damn it, Harvard!
IN THE ATMOSPHERE
Tomorrow will be slightly chilly, with a high of 57 degrees. There’s a zero percent chance of rain, but skies will remain generally overcast throughout the day. At least the leaves are starting to grow in—otherwise it would be tough to tell if we were having spring or just already going back into fall.

Some days I find myself walking through the Kirkland servery cursing the HUDS god of cuisine for that day’s offerings. Why oh why put that rubbery calimari in the paella? Who thought banana creme froyo would be a hit? What the heck is that weird tofu concoction they put out for the vegetarians? Other days I revel in the beauty that is warm sourdough bread, pesto tortellini, guac at lunch (!!), and that chocolate dessert that’s to.die.for.
Since we’re all pretty much confined to whatever HUDS deigns to feed us each day (the Co-op is looking pretty good right about now), it’s not a surprise that almost everyone has an opinion on the grub served up in the d-halls. (Some of my friends actually love when the cookies are burnt...what?!) And some people, at least in Kirkland, even like to write down their opinions about HUDS’s gastronomical whims.
Comment cards are available in all houses, but this reporter’s thorough research (read: went to the River West d-halls at brain break) showed that only Kirkland truly utilizes them. Maybe it’s because the board is in full view right in front of the conveyor belt to drop off dishes? There is rarely a week where the entire bulletin board isn’t full of compliments, requests, or complaints. And the nicest guy even responds professionally to every single one! Here are some examples from this week:
Some weirdo asked for more grapes on pizza...
 


And another expressed their discontent with the new hummus, as well as a punny reminder for the refreshment of a certain spice...

Here’s something you don’t usually hear in discussions about the increasingly competitive landscape of college and graduate school admissions: rejection letters don’t only sadden students. They have the same strong emotional impact on admissions committee members as well.
Angel B. Perez, former Director of Admission and Financial Aid at Pitzer College in Claremont, wrote in his emotional op-ed for the Los Angeles Times that what “families don't see is the amount of emotion that admissions officers across the country pour into making these decisions. These students don't know that behind closed doors, we argue about these difficult decisions. Each of us fights for the kids in admissions committee meetings, and we're truly sad when we turn away applicants…”
Jean Webb—the former Director of Admissions at Yale Law School and current admissions counselor for InGenius Prep—felt similarly to Angel Perez when discussing her emotional reactions to making decisions on law school applications.
“Admissions officers care about people. If they don’t, the simply don’t last long in the business. They also care about creating opportunities for people who have encountered obstacles to success. It is incredibly exciting when an offer of admission is a dream-come-true for someone,” Webb said.
But the unfortunate flipside of that, she added, is that it is saddening to not be able to tell someone that their dream cannot happen. And, at an institution as selective as Yale, Webb said she has to do so more than 90% of the time.
When we asked her to recount one of those thousands of sad cases she told us:
"One of my saddest experiences was of a case like that—but one that didn’t have a happy ending.  The admitted student, [who had] a learning disability—had strong support from his family throughout his education and appropriate accommodations from his undergraduate institution.  The documented disability made it possible for him to take the LSAT under accommodated conditions, and he performed very well.  His letters of recommendation were outstanding.  Once the student enrolled, however, his work was far below the expectations of his first semester faculty member and student teaching assistant, that they came to the admissions office to look at his file.  Had we made a mistake?  I don’t think so.  But such situations—for better or for worse—make admissions officers cautious about reaching outside the school’s 'comfort zone' in making offers."
So, by now, I know what you must be thinking: “Boo Hoo! Admissions officers had to make tough decisions, but that doesn’t make me feel any better, and it certainly doesn’t put an acceptance letter in my hands.”
The point of this article isn’t to make you feel bad for these admissions officers, but rather to raise awareness about the fact that it doesn't always have to be this way. As Angel Perez explained, admissions readers bring applications to committee and vehemently argue about the difficult cases. By putting yourself in the best possible position with the most polished application and a truly compelling application persona, you can arm your admissions reader with all the fodder he or she needs to get that “admitted” stamp on your file.
