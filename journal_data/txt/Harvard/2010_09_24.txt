After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For me, the fall so far has been an invigorating workout. On top of the customary flurry of shopping, I was changing my concentration and was chasing down at least five different academic oracles in an effort to figure out my life once again.
In the very few moments I had free from fighting the Course Planning Tool (it won, in the end), I found myself reprising the Core versus Gen Ed question. By virtue of the existence of such programs, the college wants our education to span a range of areas in at least some depth. But how effective is it at providing such opportunities, and are its standards and expectations reasonable? And what is the point of such education? In mulling this over, my thoughts wandered back to, of all places, last spring.
In March, the Harvard Salient published an article opposing Harvard’s ethnic studies options. The author suggested that what it means to be educated had not changed over the course of the last 2,000 years, that Harvard “need not offer a course on African civilizations if there is none worthy of study. The progressive priorities of Harvard’s curriculum usually do not coincide, however, with the promotion of meaningful areas of study... Curricula should be essentially conservative and permanent.” 
While I believe The Salient publishes most of what it does expressly to provoke, the issue could not help resonating with me. As I wandered in and out of courses the first week weighing the merits of switching from premed concentrating in the hard sciences to one of those rare birds who juggle French 142 and organic chemistry, I reflected on what it meant to be educated.
Brennan had indeed posed some Salient questions, albeit indirectly. By approving courses of study and designating courses as part of the Core or Gen Ed curriculum, does Harvard define what is worthy of knowing and, in turn, what it means to be educated? If so, how authoritative are these judgments? In the past, it was easy to define a canon that every educated person should know because there was simply less to know. As far as recorded history went, there was less material. In the realms of literature and philosophy, less had been published. Until the 19th century, colds were believed to be caused, literally, by cold because germs had not yet been discovered.
But with the loosening up of education requirements at Harvard, we're seeing math concentrators who don't know what DNA base pairs are or what the North Atlantic Treaty Organization does and music concentrators who don't know pre-calculus. We’re seeing premeds such as myself who can tell you much about cattle raid sagas in early Ireland, Samurai ethics, the Meiji restoration, and New Wave French cinema but nothing about George Washington except that he was the first president and that he suffered from frequent toothaches. What I do know of world history that isn't boutique specialty-interest comes from Wikipedia and early high school. As such, my knowledge of what might be called the Western and American canon is, admittedly, rather shallow. And I am certain I am not the only one at Harvard for whom this is true.
I am not proud of this. In fact, it makes me feel insecure and intellectually unfulfilled. Yet if working toward a degree from a world-class university does indeed make one “educated,” then I must be above average when it comes to being “educated,” whatever that means. And yet, the answer to “what does it mean to be educated” remains elusive.
Of course, should all education still be spoon-fed to us at 20, and should we blame institutions for the yawning gaps in our knowledge of the world around us? Formal instruction is but a starting point. There is much to be said for initiative and self-education, and many of history's the best and brightest minds were self-taught, from Tom Stoppard, author of “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead,” to Dmitri Mendeleev, one of the first developers of the periodic table.
Then again, do historians or musicians need to know calculus, and do mathematicians need to understand the structure of DNA? Does merely knowing a great deal about the Continental Congress and the American Revolution make one an informed citizen in 2010?
Claims can be made either way. Regardless – I think everyone needs a basic framework of awareness of who we are as a global civilization, of how we got here, and how this relates to issues that are immediate to this day and age. As such, studying “Old Dead White Guys” is not sufficient. But neither are boutique-interest, relatively narrowly focused courses that adhere to a certain format.
What's the answer, then? Admittedly, I don't have one that isn't nebulous. Perhaps more courses that focus on using the range of tools – economic, scientific, and humanist – to solve international disasters, such as Harvard Medical School Professor Paul Farmer's Societies of the World 25. Perhaps survey history courses that never cease to tie things to the present. Perhaps a region-by-geographic-region requirement to avoid Eurocentrism would be superior to too great an effort to avoid Eurocentrism.
What I do know is that I sprung for a multi-disciplinary education as a premed Romance Studies concentrator focusing on French colonialism and international influence because I believe that education is not about excluding any topic as unworthy of further scrutiny, whether as an academic or personal pursuit. After all, only in the process of further scrutiny does one become capable of judging whether or not something is “rot” and ought to be dropped. And, as Jeremy R. Knowles, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, stated in his Fall 2006 address to the Harvard freshman class, being able to tell if a man is “talking rot” is the ultimate goal of a liberal arts education. We cannot, of course, delve into everything. But we must be introduced to as much as possible, so that it may, hopefully, pique someone's interest enough for them to go out and test it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Anyone who has ever seen a tampon commercial knows that menstruation is a topic best broached by euphemism. Downward dogs in white spandex, slow-motion runs on the beach, blue liquid seeping into a quilted pad: All both infer and idealize that which cannot be named. On par with the opacity of perfume ads, they leave the viewer with almost no information about either the product or its function. After viewing one of these spots, periods may remain mysterious and—let’s face it—totally gross, but having one sure seems like fun!
Recent research reveals that menses may do more than predispose women to spontaneous bouts of exercise. The ovulating woman, indeed, is species unto her own. She gravitates toward the Prince-Eric-ilk: manly men with symmetrical features, deep voices, and chiseled cheekbones. She exudes intoxicating odors that signal her sexual earnestness to all men within sniffing distance. She is more likely to be unfaithful to her hubby, particularly if his beer belly suggests a sub-par genetic make-up. If she works at a strip club, she grosses more money in tips—the thought of sanitary napkins being, of course, a potent aphrodisiac. And, as last month’s Journal of Consumer Research argues, she dresses skankier. Forget sweatpants: only sexy garb—low-cut blouses and slinky skirts—appeal to the female on her flow.
Such subtle mannerisms, these studies emphasize, are performed unconsciously. Unlike others in the animal kingdom, women fail to register when the time is ripe for reproduction. Female chimpanzees may experience red, inflamed rumps, but the Homo sapiens is a special breed: Her eggs offer no telltale signs of their imminent jaunt across the Fallopian tube. Moreover, the reports imply, such techniques of slow, steady seduction are geared toward one end: baby-making. The aforementioned ovulating-women-dress-to-impress study is explicit on this point. While men can spread their seed at will, women must be more discriminating about whom they bed: their womb, after all, is what ultimately will reap the consequences. Because desirable sperm donors are in short supply, the fertile female must do everything in her power to out-slutify her same-sex competitors. The more skin she shows, the better her odds of reproductive success.
These studies stem from a single scientific premise: the Ovulatory Shift Hypothesis. Articulated in a 2005 paper, the Hypothesis contends that natural selection has selectively shaped the female psyche to “shift” when conception is possible. But note the operative word here: “hypothesis.” Far from definitive fact, this theory remains highly speculative. What’s more, it has historically relied on research of limited scope and dubious methodology. Take, for example, this 2007 study concluding (surprise of surprises!) that menstruating women wear shorter skirts—based on a sample size of thirty. Complicating matters are the broader controversies surrounding evolutionary psychology: a field perennially plagued by charges of reductionism.
The question of whether women discreetly divulge their fertility certainly merits scientific study. Not all work on this issue, however, aims toward a purely epistemological end. Certain studies, like that in the Journal of Consumer Research, are motivated by commercial concerns. Indeed, according to a separate 2009 study, ovulating women constitute a distinct and, as of yet, unexploited market niche: one prone to overspending on lingerie, high heels, and other frivolities. If retailers could only target females during their peak impulse-buying phase, cosmetics’ sales would surely spike—or so the logic goes. Yet, as Slate’s Jessica Grose notes, this economic rationale proves untenable. How would retailers gauge when their customers were optimally fertile? By collecting urine samples en masse, testing for pre-menstrual hormones, and timing catalog mailings accordingly? Instituting “ovulating-only” sections in department stores would be equally insane. No woman wants to be ghettoized because her estrogen levels happen to be high.
Menstruation has long been shrouded in stigma and taboo. In pre-modern societies, menstrual blood was alternately feared, revered, and fetishized, imputed with the power to both cure lepers and devastate the harvest. At the dawn of the 19th century, the female flow remained an enigma governed by religious notions of impurity and sin. By the mid-20th, psychoanalysts had variously associated menses with castration anxiety, penis envy, self-injury, disease, witchcraft, blood-sucking, and even vampires. Contemporary discourses surrounding menstruation are no less expansive. P.M.S. now doubles as noun and verb, drugs like Seasonique promise women only four periods per year, and an “iPeriod” app allows smartphone users to fastidiously track their monthly cycles.
Menstruation, therein, is more than a biological occurrence: It is a socially constructed phenomenon, emanating as much from cultural stereotype as from women’s own wombs. The studies elaborated above overlook this crucial fact. Reducing women to hysterical bodies motivated by a singular telos—finding a mate and having babies—such research smacks of essentialism. It reifies tired stereotypes of women as irrational, catty, and intensely competitive over a presumed “limited supply” of attractive men. What’s more, it advances an understanding of woman as Nature’s passive playtoy, forever enthralled by biological forces beyond her control.
The psychology of my clothing selection is one “discovery” I can live without.

According to a study by Northeastern University, Boston schools are among the most racially segregated in the United States. Although the city’s long history of homogenous public schools include past attempts to remedy the situation, Boston schools still remain divided along racial lines. We believe that the best way to overcome this unacceptable status quo lies in improving the facilities that currently exist. Bolstering the quality of public education in the area is Boston’s best hope for overcoming the disappointing realities highlighted in the survey.
One major, underlying cause of this de-facto segregation is undoubtedly the poor quality of certain schools in the Boston area. As citizens of Massachusetts and members of families that pay taxes, all school children have the right to a quality education, and thus the state ought to invest more money in improving existing, failing public schools. The funding schools receive is currently linked to the taxes levied on property surrounding them, perpetuating inequality. Instead, property taxes should be pooled at the state level and distributed so as not to disadvantage low-income neighborhoods.
Since segregation is both a symptom of societal inequality and a cause of it, resolving the problem will be complex. As the state and country work to address these long-term issues, we must ensure—in the short term—that students are getting as good an education as possible now.  If Boston schools improve, wealthier parents will feel more comfortable sending their children to public institutions instead of choosing private ones, potentially ameliorating the situation. However, this process will not happen overnight, since it will take time for families to respond to improved schooling in their area—all the more reason to start this process immediately.
We posit that improving schools over time will serve students better than inorganically attempting to rectify segregation through busing and other measures. Boston’s busing program in the 1970’s, meant to accomplish these same goals, largley served to alienate minority students in a new environment. Rather than transporting a limited number of disadvantaged students in and out of difficult neighborhoods, the state should aim to improve existing schools so that desegregation happens naturally.
On their path to improvement, Boston public schools should adopt successful charter school methods, since these institutions have historically employed effective education strategies that could improve student performance if implemented more widely. Additionally, funding should be allocated to improve current charter schools and establish new ones, given their proven efficacy.
The gap in quality between schools located within different Boston neighborhoods must be addressed if we expect de-facto segregation to diminish. Boston’s rich diversity can change a child’s perspective on the world if she is truly surrounded by it. We must invest in students’ education today so that future students will no longer learn in a racially homogenous classroom.

The Harvard Meat Less Initiative’s widely publicized effort to convince Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services to serve less meat during meals is solidly grounded in fact and scientific evidence. Studies have consistently shown that individuals who eat less meat—particularly vegetarians—live healthier, longer lives, and the environmental impact of eating less meat could mean a slowdown to the carbon emissions and land degradation that livestock cause. No significant research has shown the benefits of sustaining our ways of meat consumption, so it ought to be easy to convince meat-lovers to change their ways and eat more veggies.
Except that hasn’t happened. At the time of this writing, only 185 individuals have signed the online petition calling upon HUHDS to reduce meat. House email lists have served as a soundboard for numerous pro-meat students to condemn the reasonable measure. For the time being there seems to be little movement on the part of HUHDS to follow through with the requests of the petitioners aside from polite responses.
The problem is that the Meat Less organizers and their supporters have overlooked a critical element of initiating behavior change: they looked to impose a set of values without fully engaging in a dialogue with students beyond the realm of facts and practicality. Instead, members of Meat Less should have looked to reason their way into their community’s own ethics and values, particularly among those resistant to any call to decrease meat servings.
At the core of the Meat Less controversy is the issue of values. What must be understood is that when one is armed with facts and still encounters resistance, the issue is no longer a matter of providing correct information. Instead, it is a far more difficult one of changing minds and behavior, something that cannot be accomplished by citing prominent scholars or offering vague benefits alone. There is a need to appeal beyond logic; the reality is that we base many of our preferences and desires on irrational grounds.
Many people understand the benefits of eating less meat, but simply don’t want to (myself included). We are used to tasting some meat at every one of our meals, and if it were not there, we would miss it on an instinctual level. We are therefore an informed body that remains unconvinced. The crucial component missing for the Meat Less initiative is to make people like me sympathize—perhaps even empathize—to a degree that I don’t feel like I’m being imposed upon.
This is difficult but not impossible. For example, a few years ago it might have been inconceivable that students would willingly forgo trays when dining; it is much easier to carry a plate, two side dishes, and a drink on a tray than it is to make two or more trips to the kitchen. However, when Harvard Houses instituted varying degrees of trayless dining, one recurring reason that students offered for enjoying the program was that it fostered a “warmer, homelier” environment. A more home-style experience is not a major theme of the Undergraduate Resource Efficiency Program and “Green” initiatives but it is the one that struck students as important on an instinctual level. As a result trayless dining is now an institution in Adams and other Houses. While losing food options has a greater impact than losing a tray, the same appeals to emotion should be made to sway us naysayers towards the other end.
Such a subjective measure seems to indicate that the most effective way to get students to sustain the Meat Less proposal is to go beyond facts and petitions, which at this point are divisive and unproductive. Too many flame wars have taken place, and with them come the danger of igniting yet another culture war between two staunchly opposed camps. A compromise like the one Meat Less has proposed does not seem unreasonable, but a continued push to ensure students do not feel slighted means confronting ideals that have been long-held by many. They need to start engaging with us at a deeper level, and that will take more time and work. Meat Less must understand that we have a beef with losing beef, and it is their obligation to convince us otherwise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Philosophy Professor Thomas M. Scanlon Jr. questioned whether people who are treated unjustly by an institution should be required to obey the laws of that institution at a lecture he gave in Pound Hall yesterday.
Scanlon centered his discussion on the relationship between individual moral philosophy and the political philosophy of institutions, challenging audience members to consider the importance of morality.
Scanlon said people have a reason to care about morality because “we have reason to care about our relations with others.”
“The distinction between what we owe to other people versus what we owe to causes and ideals was illuminating,” said first-year Law School student Al-Amyn S. Sumar, who said he had read an article by Scanlon while a graduate student at the University of Cambridge.
Scanlon also spoke about former Harvard Professor John Rawls’ influential theories on justice.
First-year Law School student Jeremy D. Farris said he believes Rawls’ theories served as a catalyst for “discussion on the relationship between justice and legitimacy.”
“I normally thought political philosophy was about the justification of coercion,” he said. But according to Scanlon, “political philosophy is actually about firstly complying with certain institutions,” Farris added.
After his talk, Scanlon answered several questions from members of the audience.
The speech was hosted by the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics. Scanlon praised the center after his speech for working to “[bring] together people from FAS and the professional schools.”

In light of the indictment of former Harvard student Adam B. Wheeler, the Harvard College Office of Admissions will take new measures to verify the legitimacy of applicants’ materials.
University President Drew G. Faust told the Boston Globe that Wheeler’s alleged deceit—falsifying transcripts, SAT scores, and letters of recommendation in his transfer application to Harvard and thereby bilking the University of over $45,000 in financial aid, research grants, and prizes—has led Harvard to make changes in its admissions process to prevent future fraud.
Saying that the Wheeler case called attention to how modern technologies make it easier to doctor documents, Faust told the Globe, “We’re going to be making appropriate adjustments, which we don’t describe because they’d be easier to undermine.”
Rainjade A. Chung ’14, who has worked in the mail and file rooms of the admissions office for the past two weeks, said that she was informed of recent changes to the admissions process designed to ensure the validity of application materials.
However, Chung said she was not confident that these measures are enough to fully prevent dishonesty.
“I don’t think they check any of the stamps or dates or where it comes from. Students really handle most of the mail,” she said. “It takes a lot to validate an entire application.”
Director of Admissions Marlyn E. McGrath ’70-’73 told The Crimson that changes to boost security are being implemented, but she refused to elaborate on those changes.
“I think every college in the country is on an annual basis reviewing its security process for ensuring the authenticity of data submitted,” McGrath said.
Wheeler, who was indicted on 20 counts in May, is currently awaiting trial in Middlesex Superior Court.

The Graduate School of Education held an advance screening of “Waiting for ‘Superman,’” a new documentary about the American education system, at the Loeb Drama Center last night.
Educators, administrators, and students nearly filled the 556 seats of the Mainstage auditorium to view the film, which featured Harlem Children’s Zone President and CEO Geoffrey Canada, a 1975 graduate of the Ed School.
The movie is a “deeply personal exploration of the current state of public education in the U.S. and how it is affecting our children,” according to a synopsis on its website. It follows the stories of five different children trying to enter charter schools across the United States.
During her opening remarks before the showing of the film, Ed School Dean Kathleen McCartney said the film will focus the country’s attention on the problems facing education today.
“It’s a bit controversial, but occasionally, you need some of that,” Michael Flaherty—president and co-founder of Walden Media, which produced the film—said to the audience. “Occasionally, you need some outrage.”
The advance screening also featured a video message addressed directly to last night’s audience from the film’s director, Davis Guggenheim, who also directed “An Inconvenient Truth.”
Rey I. Faustino, a student at the Kennedy School, said that the issues illustrated in the film “hit straight home.”
“It was just another reminder that we need to continue the work that we’re doing,” said Faustino, who added that he hoped the film would be a catalyst for reform.
Tim J. O’Brien, a doctoral student at the Ed School, said that the film did not introduce him to new concepts but had a strong impact on him nonetheless.
“It’s a lot more powerful when you meet the families and their kids,” O’Brien said.
The film’s portrayal of American charter schools would be a potential topic of debate, according to several guests at the event.
O’Brien, for one, said he hoped that viewers did not conclude that charter schools were the only solution to the nation’s education problems.
Ronald F. Ferguson, senior lecturer on education and public policy at the Ed School and the Kennedy School, said the film did not give clear advice to address the problems of education.
“I’m looking forward to seeing a national conversation about the movie,” Ferguson said.
The Graduate School of Education will host a discussion panel for faculty members to respond to the film on Oct. 14. The advance screening and panel discussions are part of the Ed School’s Askwith Forums, a series of public lectures that encourage conversations about education.

A recent study analyzing the effects of the 2006 Mass. health care insurance reform law revealed that while insurance coverage has increased overall and cost has become less of a barrier for obtaining coverage, the reform’s effects have not been felt equally among certain groups of people.
The study, conducted by researchers at the Medical School, examined the reform’s effects on insurance coverage, cost barriers, self-reported health status, and accessibility to doctors from 2006 to 2008.
The study found no overall improvement in health status of individuals or doctor accessibility.
The disparity in insurance coverage between whites, blacks and Hispanics saw no improvement, according to Jennifer Haas, one of the study’s authors who is an associate professor at both the Medical School and the School of Public Health. Haas added that disparities between socioeconomic groups remained the same.
The study compared data from Massachusetts with health care data from across New England to see which changes could be attributable to the state’s health care reform.
The regional data reflected similar inequalities. Blacks saw little increase in coverage in both Massachusetts and New England. Hispanics, a group whose coverage in the state did increase, had no significant increase across New England, Haas said.
Haas suggested ways to address the inequalities, such as additional outreach efforts.
“We can make sure that all groups have adequate access to being able to find programs,” she said.

Mass. Senator Scott Brown issued a harsh rebuke to Harvard yesterday for its positions on ROTC and the DREAM Act, saying in a statement that the University “has its priorities upside down.”
In yesterday’s Boston Globe, University President Drew G. Faust said that Harvard would not officially recognize ROTC unless the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy banning openly gay service members is overturned—comments to which Brown, a Republican, reacted strongly.
The senator contrasted the University’s stance on “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” with its recent strong support for the DREAM Act, which would give some illegal immigrants the opportunity to serve in the military as well as attend college.
“It is incomprehensible to me that Harvard does not allow ROTC to use its facilities, but welcomes students who are in this country illegally,” he said in the statement posted on his website. “They should embrace young people who want to serve their country at a time of war.”
The spat unfolded two days after the Senate—under threat of a Republican filibuster—declined to take up a measure that would have allowed gays to serve openly in the military.
Harvard expelled ROTC in 1969 due to the Vietnam War’s unpopularity among students and faculty. In more recent years, the University has not allowed ROTC to return since administrators believe that the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation.
Since 1976, students who wished to participate in the program have attended classes and training through a consortium program with MIT, which is funded exclusively by alumni donations.
University spokesman John D. Longbrake said the University’s positions on the DREAM Act and ROTC were not incompatible.
“We share Senator Brown’s goals and very much want to make sure that all young people living in our communities can serve in the military­—the DREAM Act does that for thousands of students and has been supported by our military leaders,” he said in a statement. “President Faust has said many times that she very much looks forward to the day when the opportunity to pursue military service will be available to all our students who have the ability and the desire to serve.”
Since assuming the presidency, Faust has engaged with students in ROTC, including having breakfast with ROTC cadets and attending their commissioning ceremony last year.
On Wednesday, a group of ROTC cadets took the field at Fenway Park on “Harvard Night,” presenting the colors before Faust threw out the ceremonial first pitch.
Though interest in ROTC has traditionally been low at Harvard, meaning that the creation of a unit at the University would be unlikely, students said they believe ROTC would benefit from official recognition.
Isaiah T. Peterson ’12, an Air Force ROTC cadet, said that while relations with the University have improved, its position based on “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” still seems shortsighted.
“We’ve been pretty happy that the University has reached out to us in the last couple years,” he said, but added that he thinks “it’s a terrible idea for Harvard to distance itself from the military, especially when it’s not the military making the policy.”

Gordon Brown, the former prime minister of the United Kingdom, suggested during a lecture he gave at the Institute of Politics last night that the solution to the global economic crisis is to create a global financial constitution and increase worldwide coordinated action.
Brown emphasized the urgency of developing this constitution while the financial crisis is still fresh on peoples’ minds, saying that once the problem is solved, people will begin to forget the issues and will never reach a conclusion on a global financial policy.
According to Brown, such a constitution would ensure that the situation that led to the economic crisis will not occur again.
“We need a global financial constitution that deals with the issues of fairness and responsibility, as well enterprise, competition, and risk,” Brown said. “Markets operate in a society and an environment where the values do not come from the market themselves; they come from people.”
In response to Richard M. Maopolski ’13’s question asking Brown to expand upon the specifics of this constitution, the former prime minister said that “you need to be absolutely sure” that your financial institutions operate in a fair way, have sufficient capital for the risks that they are taking, have the necessary liquidity, and that the different supervisors and regulators cooperate in their work.
Brown said he believes that increasing overall economic growth rather than simply focusing on eliminating deficits should be an essential part of the changes to the world’s economic structure. In particular, he noted that countries should rethink the current system in which Asian countries are primarily producers and Western countries are primarily consumers.
“If we simply think that each of us can export ourselves out of the current economic problems, and every country thinks they can export, then it cannot happen because someone has to import goods,” he said.
Brown was elected to Parliament in 1983 and served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1997 to 2007 while Tony Blair was prime minister. In 2007, Brown became prime minister and leader of the Labour Party. He resigned in May 2010 when the Labour Party lost the majority in Parliament. He remains a member of Parliament representing Krikcaldy and Cowdenbeath.

Former United Kingdom Prime Minister Gordon Brown sped through a whirlwind agenda in three days as a Visiting Fellow at the Institute of Politics, meeting with students and faculty and delivering a lecture to a packed Forum.
“I think it’s been extraordinary, the intensity of his program here, and he seems to have enjoyed it immensely,” IOP Interim Director John C. Culver ’54 said. “There is one different audience after another, back to back, night and day.”
In an interview with The Crimson, Brown—who served as prime minister from 2007 to 2010—stressed the importance of cross-border cooperation in many contexts, such as the resolution of the financial crisis and the evolution of top-tier universities.
Brown said that more international collaboration would be necessary in the aftermath of the crisis—also a theme of his speech last night—even though some nations may be tempted to retreat into protectionism.
“We’re seeing a seismic shift with the world,” he said, partly because Europe and America are no longer producing all the world’s goods.
Brown said that one of Harvard’s strengths is the broad range of nationalities and perspectives represented on campus.
“I think the best universities are international and cosmopolitan,” Brown said. “The more people can study with each other across borders and boundaries, the more our global society will be enhanced.”
Prior to moving to 10 Downing, Brown served as Chancellor of the Exchequer for 10 years, and he contrasted these experiences in terms of the sweeping portfolio that the Prime Minister manages.
“As finance minister, you deal with the big questions about jobs growth and the economy, which, of course, are, at the moment, the central issues for every country,” Brown said. “But in the job I had until only a few months ago, you are also dealing with terrorism, foreign relations, and defense issues. The month I started we had a terrorist threat, a bomb, foot and mouth disease, a swine flu epidemic, and big flash floods. You have to be prepared for anything.”
During Brown’s visit, he ate dinner with about 100 undergraduates, had pizza with about 50 freshmen, and spoke to the Woodbridge Society, the International Relations Council, and the Harvard College British Club.
Several British students at Harvard said they relished the chance to meet a figure who has played such a long-running and prominent role in their nation’s politics.
“I was so excited because, for me, every political memory I have has involved Mr. Brown,” Visiting Fellows coordinator Sophie A. Fry ’13 said.
Brown has been to Harvard multiple times, yet his staff—made up of an aide and some security—is fascinated by the House system and students’ distaste for the Quad, said Katie R. Zavadski ’13, one of Brown’s three undergraduate liaisons.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
House budgets have been modestly increased by five percent or less this year—with Quad House budgets increasing the most—due to an extensive evaluation of House finances initiated in the midst of the financial crisis.
No individual House budgets were cut this year, though the amount of money allotted to the House system still remains “nowhere near” levels that existed before the recession forced the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to slash budgets across departments, said Howard M. Georgi ’68, the master of Leverett House, who led the nearly year-long evaluation.
The purpose of the group that conducted the evaluation was to develop a fair scheme to dispense money across the Houses, while making sure that a student in any House “is afforded the same kind of experience” as he would in other Houses, said Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson, who oversees the House system.
“It was a matter of coming up with a fair funding process, one that looked at all of the Houses, the history of when the Houses came into existence, and the funds that existed in each House based on their history,” Nelson said.
But the group decided to develop a model for House funding when it discovered that House budgets were not the product of a systematic formula, Georgi said.
“We quickly learned that the budgets were based on historical accidents and back-room deals,” Georgi said. “There was no rhyme or reason to any of this.”
After interviewing House staff and comparing the budgets and programming of each House, the group discovered that the Quad Houses were generally underfunded, although not by a large amount, Georgi said.
Beginning this year, older Houses will draw on their endowments more heavily than in previous years, although much of this money remains restricted to very specific uses, according to Nelson.
These changes were in line with a spending philosophy that rose to the forefront in FAS at the height of the financial crisis: the first-dollar principle, which calls for the spending of dollars designated for specific purposes before dispensing money that doesn’t face similar restrictions.
Adams House Master John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 said that while he wishes his House could continue to use its individual funds to supplement rather than replace the funds provided by FAS, he understands the rationale behind the change.
“The College, though short on money, didn’t want to cut back unfairly on Houses, whether they have resources or not,” Palfrey said.
Though the Houses are operating with less funding than before the financial crisis and have had to pare down some non-essential functions, budget planners have sought to avoid a scenario where Houses lose their uniqueness.
“The Houses understood that we don’t want to make everyone the same,” Georgi said. “We want to preserve the autonomy of the Houses.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council took the first steps towards finalizing a budget for Optional Winter Activities Week last night, passing legislation through its Finance Committee to allot $20,000 towards student group funding for the final week of January Term. The legislation will come before the full UC on Sunday.
The $20,000 that the legislation plans to aside for OWAW programming comes from the approximately $376,000 budget that the UC expects to receive from the Student Activity Fee. This years’ estimated budget is on par with last year’s student activities budget, when the UC did not have to accommodate OWAW events.
Earlier this month, UC President Johnny F. Bowman ’11 had estimated that $15,000 would be set aside for OWAW funding, $5,000 less than the actual proposed budget. UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11 said that the increase in the budget will give the UC more “wiggle room” when looking at applications, but he stressed that the UC will not necessarily use the entire budget.
“This was the maximum amount that I felt comfortable taking out of the grants fund while still meeting the needs of student groups who have good proposal ideas,” said Finance Committee Chair Luis A. Martinez ’12.
According to Hysen, no explicit cuts have been made from the budget to accommodate the reshuffling of funds, but he expects grants to decrease slightly in the beginning of the spring, as many of normal spring kick-off events will instead be held during the last week of January. But Martinez said that small chaneses in policy for term-time grants will provide much of the savings. For example, the UC will encourage student publications to move online while cutting printing grants in half.
At next week’s meeting, the committee will decide the policy guidelines for OWAW grants, which Martinez said would differ from term-time UC funding guidelines. For example, though the UC does not ordinarily fund travel outside the Boston area, Martinez said he hopes the UC will be able to subsidize travel for student groups during January. In addition, while only official student groups may apply for funding from the UC during the semester, individual students and unrecognized student groups will be eligible to use the new fund.
According to the legislation, the guidelines will be available by Oct. 1, and students and student groups will have until Nov. 7 to write proposals.
“We want a holistic idea of what the week will look like in its entirety before we make decisions,” Martinez said. “We want it to reflect the diversity of groups and the diversity of people on campus.”

University President Drew G. Faust has not confirmed that psychology professor Marc D. Hauser will be returning to Harvard, contrary to expectations that the professor will resume teaching during the next academic year.
In an interview with The Boston Globe on Wednesday, Faust said there are “too many uncertainties of what the future is going to bring” for her to be able to say that Hauser will assume his normal teaching duties again.
Moreover, Hauser “may decide he may not wish to come back,” she said.
Hauser is currently facing a federal investigation into alleged scientific misconduct in his research on cognitive abilities in primates. Faust told The Globe that the findings of the investigation may also influence Hauser’s decision to return to Harvard.
In its own investigation, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences found Hauser “solely responsible” for eight instances of scientific misconduct, leading to a retraction of one of his papers and a correction on another article.
A third article, published in the journal Science, was also called into question, according to a letter from FAS Dean Michael D. Smith. The experiments in that paper were re-run upon discovery that some of the conclusions were based on “insufficient note-keeping and records,” according to Ginger Pinholster, director of public relations at the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The replicated results are undergoing a peer review.
Despite these findings and the pending investigation, Hauser, who did not return a request for comment, is scheduled to return to his teaching post during the next academic year.
“I will return to teaching in the fall of 2011, including courses both at the College and at the Extension School,” Hauser wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson on Aug. 30, after canceling courses he had been scheduled to teach at the Extension School this year.
Faust’s comments to The Globe follow a public interview she gave with former ABC News anchor Charles Gibson on Tuesday, during which she said that the process to remove a professor from the faculty “indeed is a process that can be used in instances of scientific or research misconduct.”
In that interview, Faust defended the University’s actions in Hauser’s case, saying that the confidential faculty-run investigation was in line with similar processes in peer institutions. She called the disclosure of some information pertaining to his case “unprecedented.”

Harvard is now the leader for point guard Spencer Dinwiddie’s services, The Back Page has confirmed.
“The visit went great. I loved it,” said Dinwiddie following his official visit to campus last weekend. “Harvard’s a really great place. I loved the atmosphere and being around the guys. It really is a place I could go.”
Dinwiddie, a six-foot-four, 175-lb senior at Taft High School (Woodland Hills, Calif.), is scheduled for a visit to Oregon next week and a trip to Colorado next month. Currently setting up a visit to UNLV, he also mentioned Georgetown and UCLA as showing interest.
“I have to take another visit or two,” he added. “That was my first visit ever to a college. Of course, it was a great experience and put it at the top of my list, but I have to take other visits to see what they have to offer as well.”
There’s no doubting that Dinwiddie, given four stars and a 93 by ESPN.com, enjoyed his time in Cambridge.
“My whole question was, ‘Do I feel like I fit there and feel like I could live there for four years?’” Dinwiddie said. “And I felt like I could do both.”
Dinwiddie mentioned that he was not at all surprised by the commitment of fellow top recruit Kenyatta Smith during the weekend.
“It fit all of us,” Dinwiddie said. “It’s the best life choice you could ever make.”

The Harvard foobtall team looks to continue its excellent start as it takes on Brown (1-0, 0-0 Ivy) in the Ivy League season opener in Providence, R.I., tomorrow night. This will be the Bears’ first-ever night game at Brown Stadium.
Last Saturday, the Crimson (1-0, 0-0) rolled over Holy Cross in its first game of the season by a score of 34-6. Harvard hopes to capitalize on that momentum as it directs its efforts to Ivy League play this weekend.
For the fourth year out of the last five, the Crimson has been selected in a poll by the national media to win the Ivy League championship.
But the media’s long-standing infatuation with Harvard hasn’t seemed to have any effect on the Crimson’s mentality.
“I’m a firm believer that looking at preseason accolades is not a good indication of what’s going to happen before the end of the season,” said senior offensive lineman Brent Osborne. “You just have to work hard every week, and whatever happens, happens.”
Against the Crusaders last weekend, Harvard displayed its prowess on both sides of the ball. On offense, the Crimson was led by senior quarterback Andrew Hatch, who completed 20 of 25 passes for 276 yards and threw three touchdowns in his first Harvard start.
Despite Hatch’s lack of previous playing time for the Crimson, Harvard coach Tim Murphy was not too surprised by the quarterback’s performance against Holy Cross.
“What you never know is how kids are going to react under pressure, how the intangibles are going to really come out,” Murphy said. “And in [Hatch’s] case, in this particular game, he played it really smart. He was really poised, [He played a] mentally and physically tough football game.”
Defensively, the Crimson was anchored by junior linebacker Blaise Deal, who led all defenders with 11 tackles and an interception, and senior Josue Ortiz, who claimed five solo tackles from the defensive tackle position, with two preventing fourth-down conversions in the second half.
But Harvard also knows that its road test in Providence might not be as deftly handled as its match against Holy Cross was.
“This should be a much tougher game for a variety of reasons,” Murphy said. “One, I just think [Brown’s] a better football team than Holy Cross. Holy Cross was a very solid team, but in all honesty, they’re not the team they were a year ago. So we’ve got to plan for a game that’s going to be much more physical, a much different type of offense and defense.”
Last Saturday, the Bears showcased their never-say-die mentality, as they squeaked out a 33-30 win against Stony Brook in double overtime—despite having trailed for the majority of the game. And in this weekend’s 110th playing of the Harvard-Brown rivalry, the Bears will be seeking retribution for their razor-thin loss last season at Harvard Stadium.
Last year, the Crimson led comfortably, 24-14, before Brown scored with 34 seconds remaining and then forced an improbable turnover off an onside kick to regain possession. In the final play of game, the Harvard defense batted down a desperation pass by the Bears to hold on and win, 24-21.
For Brown, the return of senior quarterback Kyle Newhall-Caballero from an injury to his throwing hand that kept him out of last week’s game, poses questions about the effectiveness of the Bears’ offense. After a record-setting season in 2009 after which he was named first-team All-Ivy, Newhall-Caballero will be without his two favorite targets, Bobby Sewall and Buddy Farnham, both of whom graduated last spring.
“I think their receiving corps is much more by committee [this year],” Murphy said. “Literally, you went ten games, and those two kids, Sewall and Farnham, never came out of the game...And since Caballero didn’t play last week, he’s still got to get used to his receiving corps. So there’s a little bit of a sense of the unknown because of the personnel they’ve lost and because it’s their Ivy opener.”
As tomorrow’s game—a game that will have some important ramifications for the Ivy League title—approaches, both teams still have much to prove on the field.
“Brown is very similar to us,” Osborne said. “They are a very tough, physical team. They are really hard workers, and when two tough physical teams come together, it’s bound to come down to the last play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the passing of the annual night game at Harvard Stadium, Ivy League football will now slip into irrelevance for the average Harvard student—at least for another few months until Yale comes to town, and it becomes acceptable to drink before noon.
But for the next nine weeks leading up to the 127th playing of The Game, how can we make Ivy League football more interesting for the typical Cantabridgian?
One solution is to schedule more night games. A greater number of Ancient Eight teams are catching on to this idea, as evidenced by the fact that three Ivy League teams are playing under the lights tomorrow night—including the Crimson, which will play in the first-ever night game held at Brown Stadium.
While night games are one way to draw students away from the library and into the stadium, I have a better solution, one that will turn the average Ivy League nerd into a diehard football junkie: fantasy football for the Ancient Eight.
What better way to drum up interest in football at the Ivy League level than to add a statistical component?
Now that we all agree that “Fantasy Football: Ivy Edition” is going to be the next big thing to hit ESPN.com, let’s start to debate the all-important question of who should be this year’s number one overall draft pick.
After a high-scoring Week 1, several candidates have emerged: three Ivy quarterbacks—Yale’s Patrick Witt, Priceton’s Tommy Wornham, and Harvard’s Andrew Hatch—passed for more than 275 yards and at least one touchdown; three running backs—Dartmouth’s Nick Schwieger, the Bulldog’s Alex Thomas, and Brown’s Zachary Tronti—managed to find the end zone at least twice; and four receivers hauled in more than 100 yards.
Of this group, a couple individuals separated themselves from the pack. Schwieger had perhaps the most impressive individual performance of any Ivy Leaguer in Week 1. The tailback not only scored two touchdowns but also rushed for 216 yards to go along with 57 receiving yards.
With 161 all-purpose yards and three touchdowns in Week 1, Yale’s Thomas also made a strong case for being selected first, but it should be taken into account that he put up those numbers against a weak Georgetown team.
Witt recorded some pretty crazy statistics against the Hoyas himself, passing for 407 yards and two touchdowns to go along with one score on the ground.
Tigers wide receiver Trey Peacock’s name should also be thrown into the mix after he hauled in 196 receiving yards and one touchdown in Princeton’s Week 1 loss to Lehigh.
But before a consensus can be reached on whom to take No. 1, perhaps we need another week to evaluate the field. With that in mind, let’s move onto the predictions for Week 2.
YALE (1-0) AT CORNELL (0-1)
After Bulldogs coach Tom Williams’ sanity was called into question for running a fake punt on fourth and 18 against Harvard in the 2009 season finale, Williams proved he still knows the rules of football last week by leading Yale past Georgetown.
It remains to be seen how much coaching Williams will actually have to do tomorrow against Cornell, a team that won just two games last season.
But to be fair to the Big Red, one of Cornell’s two victories in 2009 came against the Bulldogs, proving that a win would not be impossible. But considering the Big Red is currently riding a nine-game losing steak, it seems unlikely.
Prediction: Yale 28, Cornell 10
TOWSON (1-2) AT COLUMBIA (0-1)
The two head coaches in this contest should be quite familiar with each other after overlapping as assistants at UConn in the early 2000s. Both coaches have not had the start to the 2010 season that they hoped for, but at least one of them will come away with a win in Week 2.
Towson has taken a couple rough losses so far this season—including a 36-point defeat at Villanova last Saturday. But Columbia is coming off a loss as well, dropping its season opener to Fordham.
The two teams appear to be pretty even, but I’ll give the edge to the Tigers given their experience against tougher opponents this year.
Prediction: Towson 17, Columbia 10
SACRED HEART (1-2) AT DARTMOUTH (1-0)
The rule of thumb when making predictions about football games involving Dartmouth is to bet against the Big Green. But this week proves to be the exception, if not the start of a new trend. Dartmouth is coming off a 43-20 win over Bucknell and enters tomorrow’s contest against Sacred Heart as 20-point favorites.
Whether this mismatch is more a product of the resurgence of Dartmouth football or the ineptitude of the Pioneers remains to be seen. But one thing is for certain: Sacred Heart has been having a rough time on the gridiron. Last weekend, the Pioneers managed to throw seven (yes, seven) interceptions in a 41-0 loss to Saint Francis.
Sacred Heart has also surrendered at least 100 rushing yards to an opposing player in each of its past two matchups. It doesn’t look like things are going to get much better this time around, as the Pioneers area going to have to deal with Schwieger, Dartmouth’s tailback who racked up 273 total yards and two touchdowns (that’s 39 fantasy points!) last weekend in a win over Bucknell.
Prediction: Dartmouth 42, Sacred Heart 14
LAFAYETTE (0-2) AT PRINCETON (0-1)
Despite the loss of middle linebacker Steve Cody—who suffered a season-ending injury in Week 1—Princeton should be able to manage a win against Lafayette.
The Leopards are coming off a close loss to Penn, the defending Ivy League champions, but with the Tigers’ offense emerging into a legitimate threat, it could be two-straight losses to an Ivy League opponent for Lafayette.
Prediction: Princeton 34, Lafayette 24
PENN (1-0) AT NO. 1 VILLANOVA (2-1)
Remember in fifth grade gym class how there was that one really big kid who used to always dominate in dodgeball and kickball? He probably should have been playing with the sixth graders, but he got some sadistic pleasure out of pegging tiny kids in the face with rubber balls.
Meet Villanova, the bully of the Football Championship Subdivision. Sure the Wildcats basketball team competes in arguably the top conference in the nation, but its football team would rather beat up on the little guys of Division I-AA like Towson.
Penn is next in line to take a dodgeball to the head as the Quakers travel to Villanova tomorrow to take on the Wildcats—currently ranked No. 1 in the FCS. Last season, Penn played Villanova respectably—falling just 14-3—but history speaks for itself: the Quakers have never once beaten the Wildcats on the road or toppled the No. 1 team in the FCS. I don’t see things changing this time around.
Prediction: Villanova 24, Penn 7
HARVARD (1-0) AT BROWN (1-0)
My guess is that this is a game that you will not want to leave early from. On top of the fact that Emma Watson could be in attendance, there is also the fact that in the past three matchups between Harvard and Brown, the game has been decided by one touchdown or less.
This season, the contest between the Crimson and the Bears features two of the Ivy League’s top quarterbacks. While Harvard quarterback Andrew Hatch is making his second start of the season, Brown quarterback Kyle Newhall-Caballero will be making his first appearance of the year after missing Week 1 with a hand injury.
Newhall-Caballero’s absence could explain why it took the Bears two overtimes to defeat Stony Brook. But with Newhall-Caballero getting thrown into the mix just this week, I don’t see Brown stealing this one from the Crimson.
Prediction: Harvard 21, Brown 17

Despite starting the regular season with a losing record, the Harvard women’s soccer team—the two-time reigning Ivy League champion—still has a target on its back. When conference play begins tonight, Penn (3-3-0, 0-0 Ivy) will have the first shot at dethroning the Crimson (2-3-1, 0-0), and Harvard will try to reassert its dominance over the Ivy League as the two teams square off at Rhodes Field in Philadelphia, Pa.
“Everyone’s opening up this weekend,” Crimson coach Ray Leone said, “so who knows what’s going to happen? It’s going to be exciting. It’s anyone’s game whenever you play anyone in the Ivy League.”
“This is our conference,” co-captain Katherine Sheeleigh said. “We’re not playing non-conference games anymore. Every game matters, and we only have seven games before we reach our ultimate goal of getting the Ivy League Championship.”
Since Harvard’s 2-0 loss to the Quakers two years back, the Crimson has been exceptionally dominant against the rest of the Ancient Eight, going 11-1-1, including a 3-2 victory over Penn last year at Ohiri Field. But every season is a new one, and even though Harvard has recently enjoyed success, it cannot afford to be complacent in its search for a third consecutive title.
“It’ll be a fierce game—there’s no question,” said Quakers coach Darren Ambrose in an interview with the Penn Sports Network this week. “I think the pressure is a little bit on them, for sure. They’re the defending champions, and they’ve got good players. But I think we’ll be ready for the challenge.”
The Crimson hopes to even out its 1-2-0 road record this season with a win tonight. With ten of its 17 games on the road this season, this game is an important stepping stone in Harvard’s quest for a three-peat.
On the other sideline, Penn has had a very up-and-down season to date, splitting the results in each set of weekend games. In all three wins, junior goalkeeper Caroline Williams has shut out the opposing team, and, with a .857 save percentage and 0.67 goals-against average, scoring against her will prove to be difficult.
“Our goal every game is to take advantage of all our opportunities,” Sheeleigh said. “No matter how tough the other defense is, we want to turn the backline, send out our players, use our numbers, and take our chances.”
Goals have been hard to come by for the Crimson so far. Harvard’s offense is led by the tandem attack of Sheeleigh and junior Melanie Baskind, each with two goals on the season. In addition, junior forward Patricia Yau, and freshmen forwards Elizabeth Weisman and Peyton Johnson have tallied a goal apiece. Yet, even with an advantage over its opponents in corner kicks, 41-33, the Crimson has been outscored 11-7. As a result, defense will be a key for Harvard to claim victory. If history repeats itself, it may take a shutout to put the Quakers away: Penn failed to score a goal in each of its three losses.
“We have play quickly,” Leone said. “Both teams are going to come out excited and ready to play. The best thing that we can do is to be ready for anything. We need to focus on our game plan and defend together.”
The Quaker’s offense may not garner as much attention as its defense has, but the Crimson cannot afford to fall asleep on the defensive end of the field. Penn freshman Kathryn Barth has scored two goals, and classmate Christina Hart, sophomore Erin Beck, and senior Kaitlin Campbell have each tallied a goal of their own.
With the excitement of the Ivy League opener approaching, it is easy to forget that this will be the first Ancient Eight game for the freshmen. For Harvard, many first-years have gotten the opportunity to play and have shown that they fit right in with Leone’s gameplan.
“The freshmen are all playing at a remarkably high level,” Leone said. “But the Ivy League is a whole different type of game. As the other girls on the team will say, it is an experience that you just have to get used to.”

After last weekend’s home football game and a host of other home games, most Harvard teams will be traveling to away matches this time around. But there are two exciting matches at home and many others games on the road to keep fans excited over the weekend.
The Harvard men’s water polo team will be hosting Fordham and Iona, both on Saturday. Recently, the squad defeated Washington and Jefferson to finish 11th in the ECAC Championships. Although the team is 3-6, it has gone 2-2 in the last four games after getting off to a 1-4 start. Against Fordham, the Crimson holds a 23-11 all-time advantage, but the Rams have won the last five meetings. Iona finished 10th in the ECAC Championships and has won the past three meetings against the Crimson.
The Harvard football team hits the road this weekend after taking down Holy Cross, 34-6, in the first game of the season. The squad travels to Providence, R.I. to take on Brown. Last year, Harvard defeated the Bears at home under the lights, 24-21, and has won nine of the last 10 meetings against Brown.
Fans looking forward to the annual Harvard-Yale game will have to wait just a little longer. But there is a Harvard-Yale matchup for the cross-country team as it faces the Bulldogs today. This is the Crimson’s second race so far, after competing in the Iona Meet of Champions last weekend. The men finished fifth out of 19 teams and the women finished 13 of 18.
Meanwhile, the men’s soccer squad hits the road to take on Stony Brook tonight and Boston University on Sunday. Currently, the Crimson is on a three-game winless streak following two ties and a loss, but in Harvard and Stony Brook’s only meeting, the Crimson emerged victorious, 4-1. As for Boston University, Harvard has won two of the last three matches, including a 1-0 win last season at home.
Also, the women’s soccer team has two away matches, taking on Penn today and Massachusetts on Sunday. In its last match, the squad won against Rhode Island to bring the women to 2-3-1 on the season. The Crimson faces its first Ivy League opponent of the season, but Harvard currently dominates the series by a large margin, 15-4-2.
The women’s volleyball squad is looking to turn its season around. Harvard is on a six-game losing streak, holding a 2-9 record. Like the women’s soccer team, the women’s volleyball squad plays its first conference match, facing Dartmouth away. Harvard leads the overall series, 42-14.
Finally, the field hockey team is also seeking to regain some momentum. After taking its first two matches, the women have dropped five straight to reach the current record of 2-5. This weekend presents the second conference match of the season, as the team takes on Penn. The Crimson lost to Penn 4-1 at home last year.
Some teams are looking to regain momentum while others are seeking to keep a winning streak alive, but one thing is clear: all of these matchups should prove to be exciting to watch for Harvard fans rooting for Crimson wins.

In a conversation with Harvard men’s soccer coach Carl Junot after the Crimson’s match against the New Mexico Lobos, the first-year head coach commented on the team’s overall progress and the necessity for the front line to put away any chance it gets. In addition, he highlighted the high caliber of teams that Harvard has faced thus far.
“In my opinion, after facing UConn and New Mexico, we have encountered two of the top teams in the country, and we’ve proven to ourselves that we are capable of competing with those guys,” Junot remarked.
He kept stressing the fact that even though the past couple of games haven’t been high-scoring matches, just as the Crimson has done its part on the defensive side, other teams have played well enough to shut down the Harvard offense.
“We are just playing against fantastic teams,” Junot explained. “There’s been two games we’ve been shut out and they were both here in New Mexico. Every other game we’ve played in we scored. I felt [against the Lobos] we created sufficient opportunities to score goals.”
Unfortunately, the Crimson strikers haven’t been able to come up with a winning goal for the past three games, and Junot understands that the hardest part of soccer is to find the back of the net. He has high expectations for his team, however, and was pleased with the recent performances of a few of his players.
“Scottie Prozeller, Baba Omosegbon, and Brian Rogers all had outstanding performances and showed leadership and true ability to be special players,” he said.
As the season continues and enters the middle section of the schedule, Junot knows what the team needs to work on if it is going to win games.
“We have to continue to learn to organize ourselves and defend well and the next step is to become a goal-scoring team,” Junot observed. “We’re getting there. We have good players who can attack.”
Harvard will meet Stony Brook tonight and Boston University on Sunday as it continues to prepare for Ivy League play.

Looking for a speedier way to get to the Quad or an environmentally friendly vehicle for touring the area? The Phillips Brooks House Association is ready to supply you with your very own bicycle (or even a moped)—but you’ll have to be the highest bidder to get one.
On Saturday, Harvard’s largest public service organization will hold its annual bike auction to raise money for its programs. PBHA Events Fundraiser Nadia L. Farjood ’13 (who is also a Crimson news writer) informed us that 35 to 40 bikes will be available for bidding, as well as spare parts like wheels and handlebars for the fixer-upper types out there. There is also one big prize—a flashy moped.
 PBHA volunteers obtained about half of the bikes by tagging seemingly abandoned bikes in the Yard and Quad this summer; those bikes whose owners did not remove the warning tags were scooped up by PBHA and will now be auctioned. The rest of the merchandise, including the coveted moped, was donated by HUPD, according to Farjood.
 From 10 a.m. to 12 p.m., prospective bikers can scope out the goods. The auction will begin at 12 p.m. and last until 2 p.m. Farjood said she predicts that the bikes will go for $50 to $350; in the 40-plus year history of the annual auction, recent revenues have ranged from $2,000 to $3,000, she said.
 So check out the auction in the courtyard in front of Phillips Brooks House this Saturday, before the wheels of your dreams are going once...going twice...sold.

Did you love banging on pots and pans as a child? Have an urge to catch the vibe of resonating gongs, melodious chimes, or reverberating drums? Then you need to check out Gamelan—a type of Indonesian music being offered on campus with artist-in-residence Jody Diamond.
Though many of Harvard’s programs tend to be overlooked, Gamelan might just be too cool for such a fate. Going on its third year at Harvard, the type of music originates in Bali and Java, and since, this melodic percussion has taken over a budding world music scene.
Every Thursday night, a group led by Diamond, a composer, gathers in Hilles Library to produce a resonance of melody, movement, and rhythm. Over 30 people—some vocalists, others musicians—partake in these collaborative sessions.
According to Diamond, Gamelan “creates a world into which a group of people may discover, learn, create, and perform together.”
All interested need only to be open and willing to learn, no Mozart-like genes required.
