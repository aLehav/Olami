After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lying anxiously in bed listening to the radio and waiting for your school’s name to be called. Realizing that that big yellow bus will never be able to make it down your block. All of the signs that school has been cancelled because of snow are distant (or, in the case of those from warmer climes, nonexistent) memories for Harvard students. 
 Although situated in a climate with considerable snowfall, Harvard has not had a cancellation of classes due to inclement weather since the infamous blizzard of 1978, a historic storm in which wind speeds were recorded at 92 miles per hour. Even Mayor Menino’s announcement of a state of emergency for Boston on Monday flew under the radar of Harvard’s meteorological decision makers.
While there is validity in Harvard’s official policy that the proximity of faculty and students allows school to proceed even in the face of inclement weather, it may be a little too stringent. Former Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III once told The Crimson that “Harvard University will close only for an act of God, such as the end of the world.”  It seems excessive to force students to wait until the apocalypse to get a snow day.
Harvard constantly tries to improve the mental health of its students, offering everything from mental-health weeks to relaxation classes to massage study breaks. It is neglecting, however, the most simple, rational, and cost-efficient treatment of all—time off from school. One can sadly only guess at what the Harvard student body’s brainpower could do given freedom in the winter wonderlands Cambridge skies cook up for them. Snow forts with n+1 housing? Intramural snowball fights at an A, B, and C level? All of these questions go unanswered when the Severs and Biolabs and Barker Centers of the campus remain open. 
College for many is about learning to live in a new environment and culture, and our current lack of snow days does an unsatisfactory job of introducing students from warmer climates the institution of the snow day. We expect students from Los Angeles, Florida, and other warm spots to take on the harshness of our winters yet do not allow them the benefit of cancellations that are pillars of elementary and high-school education in New England.
As with anything else at Harvard, this is not all about the students. Where in this policy is consideration of our faculty? Some faculty may be lucky enough to reside in Cambridge, but what about those who have built their nests further out, with houses in Newton, flats in Peabody, and apartments in Winchester? Instead of having a day full of delays, distractions, and slush in the hallways, Harvard should make its snow day policy more lenient for convenience, peace of mind, and respect of a New England staple.
The Harvard bubble may insulate us from local and national politics, outside culture, and perhaps even the economic crisis, but it cannot protect us from the snow.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Late last week, Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino joined the chorus of dissenters over Harvard’s decision to slow construction of the science complex in Allston and to delay plans for further expansion. The mayor’s office was closely involved with the university in planning and advancing the Allston master plan. Menino expressed his criticism of the Allston slowdown in a strongly worded letter to President Faust.
Taking up the defense of the Allston community, which has vocally opposed construction setbacks, the mayor insisted that the city be included in the decision-making process, that the Allston construction project continue, and that the university’s administration meet with the Boston Redevelopment Authority within 60 days. At these proposed meetings, Menino expects the university to divulge information about the master plan for Allston development and cooperate with the city to alleviate the “blight to the neighborhood” caused by vacant lots—purchased and now left empty by Harvard.
Menino makes compelling points about the need for greater cooperation in the continuation of the Allston construction program. Finishing the science center already begun in Allston should be a priority of the university, as it will greatly benefit Harvard and the Allston community, boosting our science programs, improving infrastructure, and supporting Allston’s economy. One further point made in the letter deserves particular attention. The university must be more transparent about the state of its finances if the Harvard community and our neighbors are to accept the host of cuts being made.
In his letter, Menino asserts his understanding “that the current economic climate has had serious, adverse implications for the university’s ability to finance large scale development.” With the obscurity that clouds Harvard’s current financial status, however, no one but the university’s administration truly can understand the implications of that economic adversity. Menino’s letter recognizes that Harvard has “an obligation” to Allston residents and the city of Boston to reveal the details of the university’s financial circumstances. In an interview, a member of Menino’s staff reiterated that the university must use the meeting before the Boston Redevelopment Authority to detail its financial reasons for the construction slowdown. The same obligation of sincere transparency should apply to all those affected by Harvard’s reactionary policies to the financial crisis.
Harvard has asked the community to endure a series of cuts in response to the sudden scarcity of financial resources. The university expects its students, staff, and neighbors to endure a hiring freeze, a push for early retirement, a tuition increase, and cuts to the custodial staff in addition to the slowdown in Allston. This has not only incited the Allston community but also prompted two Harvard professors to threaten to leave, angered the unions involved in construction and custodial work, and left all involved in a state of clouded confusion about the reality of Harvard’s financial position. If the university expects those affected by this to accept the drastic cuts in so many sectors, they must provide better evidence that these cuts are explicitly necessary.
The administration has released conflicting statements about the availability of resources allocated to the Allston project. The university has claimed that the Strategic Infrastructure Fund, an annual 0.5-percent levy on the endowment to support projects in Allston, has been essentially depleted. At a Dec. 9 faculty meeting, however, President Faust suggested that the university was considering diverting Allston funds to other areas.
While the university has some reasons to hide some of the precise details of its finances, this kind of confusion could be easily clarified with a greater transparency of the university’s overall financial situation. Specifically, Harvard should be more forthcoming with details about the liquidity and flexibility of its endowment assets.
Harvard cannot expect the community members of Allston, the city of Boston, nor our own university stomach such cuts without clarifying exactly why exactly the tens of billions of dollars that still remain are not sufficient to cover—at least what should be—the spending priorities of the school.

In developing America’s foreign policy over the last few months, the Obama administration has extended its hand to a number of different countries. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has already made two trips, the first to Asia and the second to Europe, to assure nations of continued alliance with the United States. This pursuit of closer global ties is promising and will start the crucial process of mending the rifts created by the previous administration. Lacking conspicuously in America’s foreign-policy plans, however, is its own neighbor—Latin America. 
In a speech at a Cuban American National Foundation luncheon in May last year, President Barack Obama promised to “pursue aggressive, principled, and sustained diplomacy in the Americas from Day One.” As he explained then, “My policy towards the Americas will be guided by the simple principle that what’s good for the people of the Americas is good for the United States.” 
Since then, plans for diplomacy in Latin America have largely fallen by the wayside. The first Western Hemispheric country to receive attention from the U.S. was not Mexico, but Canada. It is questionable as to why Obama chose to personally acknowledge the needs of Canada first when other countries in our part of the world have much more pressing needs.  
Indeed, America’s track record in Latin America leaves something to be desired. The recent expulsion of a U.S. diplomat from Ecuador is a case in point. The diplomat was expelled on the grounds that his alleged interference “undermine[d] the jurisdiction and powers of national authorities able to make decisions regarding who should lead a special investigations unit.” The U.S. Department of State countered that the U.S. has had peaceful, non-intrusive relations with the country. Regardless of whether the U.S. is guilty of the accusations, the scandal’s message sends negative signals to the rest of Latin America. This is not the kind of positive image America ought to be cultivating with Latin American countries.  
At any rate, helping its southerly neighbors is in America’s own best interests. In a dramatic turn of events, Mexico’s drug war seems to be spilling over into Arizona. Recent Mexican-linked abductions in Phoenix are clear examples of the consequences of failing to stabilize the region. Reuters reported that Washington has pledged to give Mexico helicopters, surveillance aircraft, inspection equipment and police training under a $1.4 billion plan to beat the cartels in Mexico and Central America. Such supportive acts are the type that Latin America needs. America should not wait to intercede in Latin American affairs until it directly affects the United States. 
Latin American leaders are willing to work with President Obama. Even President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela has been overwhelmingly positive, saying that, “If he wants to converse with the Venezuelans, we are here at the order without conditions.” And, in a recent letter to Obama, 300 regional experts wrote that “U.S. prestige in the region is now at a historic low… Our hope is that you will embrace the opportunity to inaugurate a new period of hemispheric understanding and collaboration for the common welfare.” 
There is therefore no reason for U.S. diplomacy in Latin America to be withheld. Obama should send diplomats to Latin America to capitalize on the goodwill Latin American leaders have evinced toward Obama and to assure the people there that they are indeed important to U.S. foreign policy. It is in the best interest of both the United States and Latin America that cooperative measures are taken to strengthen Latin American economies and reduce crime. That said, a deeper dialogue between the nations should begin with all due speed.

Iran’s recent test of its Omid satellite has raised concern that the next launch could be tipped with a less palatable cargo. But, even though the launch does raise some concerns about Iran’s military potential, the United States should continue to pursue an even-handed strategy of engagement with the Islamic Republic. In particular, plans for a Central European missile shield should be shelved until further notice.
The Iranian test has raised alarm bells in the West and renewed interest in the Bush administration’s harebrained scheme for a European missile defense program in Poland and the Czech Republic. But, before we commit to such a program, the Obama administration should remember the most important lesson of the Bush years: the importance of using diplomacy first. Before committing to the expensive and unproven missile shield in Central Europe, the United States should exhaust all of its remaining diplomatic options. 
The proposed missile shield will not only encourage overly militaristic behavior in the Pentagon, but it will also seriously damage our already-tenuous relationship with the Russian Federation. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia has had a rocky relationship with its former Warsaw Pact allies, especially Poland. Moreover, Moscow has viewed the continued expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance into Central and Eastern Europe as evidence of growing American hegemony. 
We should take the Russians seriously. After all, the last time we stared them down, it took 40 years—and trillions of dollars in defense spending—to “win” the Cold War—a victory that was accompanied by the wholesale economic collapse of the entire region. And the Russian leadership is highly aware of the stakes at hand. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has accused the US of initiating “a new round of arms race,” and Russian President Dimitri Medvedev has warned that Russia is “not afraid of… a Cold War.” Hopefully Medvedev’s threat relies more on bravado than truth, but this assumption is not a risk worth taking. As the recent South Ossetian conflict indicates, Russia is willing to use force to assert its power in the region.
The move also threatens our new alliances with Poland and the Czech Republic, two of our strongest backers in the NATO organization. Moreover, the majority of Poles and Czechs oppose the plan, which would needlessly put them at risk of armed conflict with Russia. Last year, President Medvedev announced that Russia would be relocating several SS-26 “Iskander” missiles to Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia’s small exclave of territory on the Baltic coast that borders NATO members Poland and Lithuania. While these plans have been temporarily put on hold, the Russian threat should be taken seriously, not needlessly provoked.
In addition to its disastrous implications for Russo-American relations in the post-Soviet era, the defense program would put a damper on President Obama’s promised negotiations with Iran regarding its nuclear weapons program. This January, at the Munich Security Conference, Vice President Joseph Biden announced that the United States would “continue to develop missile defenses to counter a growing Iranian capability,” hardly the language of constructive diplomacy. To many, Biden’s speech sent a very direct message to Tehran: Even with Bush gone, it remains part of the “axis of evil.” This is  the wrong posture to adopt at a time when preventing Iran from going nuclear is in our best interests.
Indeed, the worst possible scenario emerging out of this diplomatic fracas is a joint Russo-Iranian alliance against the United States. Energy-rich Russia and Iran have struck a friendship of sorts. In 2000, then-President Putin abrogated the 1995 Gore-Chernomyrdin agreement and renewed arms dealings between Russia and Iran. Since then, Putin has signed a $1 billion arms deal with Iran and supported Iran’s nuclear ambitions. During Putin’s 2007 visit to Tehran, the first trip to the Iranian capital by a Kremlin leader since Joseph Stalin’s visit in 1943, Putin and Iranian President Ahmadinejad discussed Iran’s nuclear energy program.
Faced with this difficult dilemma, the Obama administration seems to have buried its head in the Persian sands; our current policy is deceptively vague. Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton has strongly hinted that the Obama administration will reconsider the European missile defense program. Still, no firm decision has been made, and by doing this we please nobody and alienate all sides of the issue: the European Union, Russia, and Iran. 
Equivocating on this critical issue will only make the problem worse. To that end, the Obama administration should firmly reject the proposed European missile defense shield, especially if it plans to diplomatically reach out to Russia and Iran in the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a decade of excess, the bubble burst. Stocks tumbled in a flurry of panic, as financial institutions collapsed. Amid the turmoil, as the endowment’s prospects worsened, Harvard’s plans for expansion fell into doubt. 
This narrative seems to contextualize the discussion surrounding today’s renovations to the House system well. The $1 billion, 15-year project has been in the works for almost two years. Despite recent reassurances about commitment to House renewal from University Hall, University President Drew Faust questioned expanding the House system in December, when she challenged the desire for and affordability of new Houses in Allston. The endowment’s 30-percent drop over the past fiscal year certainly could not have been far from mind.
Yet the narrative is not from 2009. It is a story that took place over a century ago, in 1928. This history of the House system’s financing offers both hope and caution for expansion today.
Like many facilities at Harvard, the House system was a gift. Unsurprisingly, it was a gift from a wealthy white man. Surprisingly, this particular man was a Yalie named Edward Stephen Harkness.  With millions from his shares in the Rockefellers’ golden swan, Standard Oil, Harkness was a philanthropic plutocrat in the tradition of Carnegie, Mellon, and Rockefeller himself. After being rebuffed by Yale, Harkness came to University President A. Lawrence Lowell in the fall of 1928, offering over $3 million to build a residential college system that would “bring into each group men from different parts of the country, men with different experience, and as far as possible social condition.”  By 1931, all seven Houses had been built, funded—at a total cost of about $13 million—entirely by Harkness.  In 2008 dollars, this would amount to over $155 million. The clamor of moving beds and bureaus signaled that this “national and democratic” microcosm Lowell and Harkness had envisioned was complete.
Space constraints threaten the democratic nature of the House system today. The “unprecedented” housing crunch, as Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 termed it, has resulted in a ban on transfer admissions for the next two years. Not only does this limit a potential source of diversity and peer learning for undergraduates, but it also drives House occupants away from their cramped quarters to decamp in inevitably less microcosmic facilities, like student organizations, final clubs, and off-campus venues.
Solving this problem would seem, at first, to be simply a matter of funding. If the endowment cannot sustain a major capital expenditure, then find a donor like Harkness. When schools like the GSAS are cutting their admissions by 10 percent, the College has no right to demand more comfortable housing—however crucial it may be to intellectual development. So why not turn to Rich Uncle Pennybags, some may ask?
There are both practical and philosophical problems with a modern Harkness. Practically, there are fewer tycoons on the scale of Harkness today—and far more legal implications to their donations. Even the $100 million that David Rockefeller donated to Harvard last April—the largest ever single donation by an alumnus—pales in comparison to Harkness’s munificent $155 million. Nevertheless, with Harvard’s centuries of experience fundraising, its numerous wealthy alumni, and its thriving Committee on University Resources such a donation seems, at least, possible. 
A bigger obstacle, then, is the paternalism that such philanthropy evinces. Donating to education is a noble cause. But what does it mean for the members of the grateful community? Not only does it leave them with an unpayable debt, but it also perpetuates a narrow exemplar: the benevolent plutocrat.
This tension between the goals of the university as a business and the university as a place for education and research is nothing new. Indeed, Thorstein Veblen described the university in 1957 as “a compromise between the scholar’s ideals and those of business, in such a way that the ideals of scholarship are yielding ground...before the pressure of businesslike exigencies.”  
Unlike Veblen, I do not argue that the exigencies of business have no place in a university. Such practical considerations are necessary to sustain centers of higher education as precisely that: institutions of learning. In this way, donations from men like Harkness and Rockefeller are crucial. Rather, the problem lies in an irrational glorification of these ideals—naming opportunities or a demand for unreasonable results, for example—that imposes the values and accomplishments of the philanthropist upon the beneficiary.
Going forward, it would do the community good to have adequate—or even more than adequate—facilities in which to live and thrive during their four brief years in the academe. However, in evaluating the possibilities for this expansion, the university must also beware of the gifts it seeks—there may be more than a few strings attached.

Professor of the Practice of Literary Criticism James Wood and Visiting Lecturer on English Claire Messud represent two different ends of the literary world. One is an incisive critic, the other is a renowned author. And they’re married. FM caught up with them—as well as their five-year-old son, Lucien, out of school for a sick day—to discuss literature, criticism, and Harvard’s social scene.1. Fifteen Minutes: I notice you both teach class from 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. on Mondays; do you carpool?Claire Messud: No, we haven’t.FM: Haven’t been bullied by the “Green is the new Crimson” initiative?James Wood: No, though sometimes I bicycle in, so that’s fairly green.2. FM: What kinds of books are your children reading right now?CM: Lucien is reading “Amos and Boris” [By William Steig], and we’ve read “Jack and the Bean Stalk”.JW: Our daughter is reading “Harry Potter” and “The Railway Children” by E. Nesbit.3. FM: What is a typical dinner discussion like in your household? Do you discuss work, or recent literature?CM: Much of the discussion at the dinner table last night was about how our daughter had pajama day. The level is not necessarily so high.4. FM: Does the writer-critic pairing inform your professional work? CM: It’s easy for me and hard for him. When I show him my work, which sometimes I do, I want him to be my loving husband and a fierce and honest critic, and I want him honestly and fiercely to tell me how great it is (Laughs). It just puts him in an awkward position. But for me it’s a win-win; and I’ll never get reviewed by him.5. FM: How do you both like working out of Harvard?JW: I think both of us feel all the intellectual benefits of academia and also the risks to the kinds of non-academic lives that we decided upon years ago. For me, this primarily involved the romance of trying to live by the pen, trying to make a salary from writing words. Obviously academics do that in a different way—but I never want to lose that primary business of essentially being a journalist, a word I’m happy and proud to use in my case.6. FM: You (CM) were quoted as saying in an interview with The New York Times, “I don’t trust people who are likeable”. What did you think of each other when you first met?  Did you find Professor Wood “likeable”?CM: I did, I did!JW: (Laughs) Perhaps not trustworthyCM: I did find him likeable, likeable and...JW: ...and a little slippery.CM: No, I did like him!  When I said that, I meant people for whom their likeability is the supreme concern. I would say actually though—that being said—he is someone who totally puts on the charm. Maybe I should be wary of him.7. FM: Do you (JW) think there should be more emphasis on criticism in undergraduate English courses? JW: Yeah, I do. If most English concentrators don’t go on to become professionally involved with literature, then the one thing you can give them actually, to carry with them in life, is some evaluative capacity. And it can be just another part of the whole repertoire of attending to a text—it doesn’t have to be a sort of “thumbs up, thumbs down” thing.8. FM: I guess that’s the danger?JW: Yes, that’s the danger, and I think that’s why academics sometimes don’t do it. But I feel [to leave criticism out] is wrong.9. FM: You published a novel of your own, “The Book Against God”. What was it like waiting for the reviews to come out, being known as such an exacting critic yourself?JW: Actually, torture. One would think that the experience would get better. That rather, like childbirth, you’d learn how to deal with the pain.10. FM: In your (CM) forthcoming novel, there’s a section about an old man moving to a retirement home. You’ve suggested that this might feel like living in a college dorm again. Does Harvard’s social scene really seem that bad?CM: I don’t know if the Harvard situation is that bad. Although, the retirement home I visited looked pretty lively—there was a gym, a swimming pool, movies, dance class, lectures...JW: ...writing papers all night.11. FM: If you could both pick one historical period to be either writing or criticizing in, it would be?CM: 1890—1930. There was a huge amount going on. There was the rise of modernism and the excitement. They had a sense of the urgency of their project; I think we live in a time in which there is a sense of irrelevance sometimes.JW: Either that period or the ’40s and ’50s. But even by that time there is already a slide in the excitement I think. The academy is beginning to take over criticism, for good and ill. But there’s something very exciting about being in London around 1910, just as modernism is about to take off—crazy Ezra Pound has come over from America and is running around town, saying, “we’re going to tear up the old forms”.12.FM: The issue of power between critic and writer is an interesting one; who runs thing in the realm of things domestic? If your (Lucien) mom and dad were yelling contradictory orders, whom would you follow?JW: Who is in charge at home, Lucien?Lucien: [silence]JW: So both of us are in charge, mommy and daddy?CM: It depends which domestic issue we’re discussing. James is the chef, I do the laundry.13. FM: So are you [CM] the food critic?CM: (Laughs) I’m more a cheerful consumer.14. FM: You’re a critic, you’re a writer, you both live under the same roof. If this were a sitcom, who would you pick to play each other?CM: If it were a sitcom no one would watch it!JW: She would get Hugh Laurie to play me.CM: He’s right. Hugh Laurie is best known now for doing “House”, but he used to be a comic actor. One thing that people don’t know about James is that he literally falls up stairs. So a British comic actor with a sense of physical comedy would work well.JW: This is tough. Maybe Julia Davis, 20 years ago?15. FM: Obviously, you two are absurdly talented individuals. But say you couldn’t do what you’re doing now (writing works of fiction and literary criticism). What do you wish you were really good at?JW: Playing the pianoCM: Just one?  I wish I were a really good photographer.

The tempting smell of grease from the Kong is what usually drags in hordes of hungry undergraduates craving spring rolls. But last Friday, it was the Chinese Student Association’s Banquet 2009 that had undergrads scrambling to dig their chopsticks into some lo mein and get their hands on a dumpling or two.For this festive affair, Leverett dining hall was transformed into a party scene packed with more than 350 guests, including students, tutors, and even professors. Dinner, consisting of a never-ending 14 courses, was catered by the Peach Farm restaurant in Chinatown. The restaurant’s strange name, according to co-president of CSA Daniel C. Suo ’09, can be attributed to a “bad translation.” But dinner was surprisingly tasty, with everything from pork and shrimp to incredible bubble tea, all of which caused attendees to declare the food superior to the Kong, despite eating it sober.The rowdy crowd was entertained throughout the meal by the Breakers, a Harvard break dancing troupe, the Asian American Dance Troupe, the Din & Tonics, and the performance martial arts group Harvard Wushu Club, a crowd favorite. When asked why the performance martial arts act was so popular, Annie Ye ’11, a Wushu performer, replied, “We have weapons and shiny stuff. That always gets the crowd riled up.”While some guests who didn’t speak Chinese might not have understood some of the jokes throughout the banquet, they nevertheless felt welcomed at the soiree. Monica S. Liu ’12, a CSA member, said that undergrads of all kinds are encouraged to join CSA and attend CSA events. “ Of course!” she said. “We love white people.”

As winter draws to a close and blocking season approaches, Harvard housing myths
are shared over Chickwiches in Annenberg.
Football players fear the Quad while legacies
assume they will follow their parents to Eliot or
Adams. Yet it seems students know more about
these myths than actual housing rules. When it
comes to coeducational living, the policy seems as
ambiguous as its name: “gender neutral housing.”A heavily publicized information session last
week offered free pizza and an explanation of
gender neutral housing. The majority of the 15
attendees were affiliated with the Queer Students
and Allies (formerly BGLTSA), campus media,
and the UC, which co-sponsored the event with
the Trans Task Force.The meeting intended to lend transparency to
the two-year-old policy that protects the housing
needs of transgender and gender questioning
students. “Most students have no clue that there’s a
gender neutral housing policy,” explains Lisa J.
Miracchi ’09, chair of the TTF, a university-wide
coalition that recently joined forces with the QSA.
But while the legislation has marked a major
victory for transgender rights, it is still challenged
by current housing constraints and arguments for
a more inclusive policy.
A LONG TIME COMING
The implementation of gender neutral housing
was the result of years of campus-wide advocacy.
Assistant Dean of the College Paul J. McLoughlin
II, a strong ally of the QSA, was one of many
dedicated to spreading trans awareness within the
Harvard community over five years ago.
“I realized that even if I was to become really
educated about it, there were still these 12 House
masters who would benefit from knowing more
about what it means to be a transgender student
and what transitioning means,” he explains.
The conversations ranged from discussions at
QSA and TTF meetings to staff training sessions
to collaborations across Harvard’s schools, leading
to increased trans awareness, more gender neutral
bathrooms, and the inclusion of gender identity
protection into the university’s non-discrimination
policy in April 2006.
These advances spurred the formation of a
committee under the Office of Residential Life to
address the viability of gender neutral housing, in
which gender is taken out of the equation to provide
a comfortable living situation for transgender
students or those who do not identify with either
gender. According to the Gender Public Advocacy
Coalition, over 50 colleges implemented gender
neutral housing policies as of July 2008.
FORMING A PLAN
Harvard’s unorthodox housing process made
policy development particularly tricky. Other colleges,
such as Dartmouth and Brown, have designated
gender neutral floors or suites across campus
that students can lottery into. But Assistant
Dean of Residential Life Joshua G. McIntosh, who
headed the ORL’s efforts, was intent on preserving
Harvard’s signature random house assignment.
“One’s house affiliation should not be associated
with your gender or your transition from one
gender to another,” he explains.
Instead, Harvard’s policy, implemented in the
spring of 2007, accommodates students’ needs
after their placement in a house. Students can
always approach their House masters about specific
rooming issues, but McIntosh serves as an
added supportive resource.
“Lots of times if you’re just coming out, you’re
in a very vulnerable situation,” Miracchi says.
“You don’t want to have to explain yourself to
everybody, so having one person who’s really well-versed
in these issues and knows all the administrators
really well is really an asset to the student.”
University policy requires locks on all bedroom
doors of mixed-gender suites. In the antiquated
river houses, necessary access to bathrooms or fire
doors in walk-through suites has often prevented
lock installation.
However, McIntosh asserts that every transgender
or gender questioning student’s requests
have been met. “At least for the moment we have
a relatively small population of students who are
coming forward and self-identifying, so it makes it
relatively easy to navigate within every house given
the space constraints,” he says.
McIntosh reports that two gender neutral
housing requests were made to his office this fall,
and more were made directly to house administrators.
FREEDOM FOR ALL
McIntosh makes clear that the ORL gender
neutral policy only guarantees mixed-gender
housing to students who identify as transgender
or gender questioning. But many more requests
for mixed-gender housing are made at the house
level by both gay and straight students.
Requests are granted at the discretion of House
masters, and getting approval can be difficult. McIntosh cites issues of equity: to satisfy the bedroom
lock requirement, co-ed blocking groups
could potentially only be housed in desirable
senior-status rooms. This bothers some students
who want guaranteed coed rooming.
“There is some dissatisfaction at this point
with the policy,” said UC President Andrea R.
Flores ’10 at the information session. “Gay students
aren’t yet where they want to be.”
Quincy resident Kevin J. Davies ’10 had to jump through “bureaucratic hoops” to be able to
live with his female blockmates his sophomore
year. He finds fault with the current gender neutral
housing policy. “I think it’s wrong to assume that
you must be questioning your gender in order to
prefer living with men or women, or for that preference
to be okay only in the case of being transgender,”
he says. “[The policy] should definitely be
more inclusive.”
A MORE NEUTRAL FUTURE
UC Communications Director Daniel V. Kroop
’10, who serves on the Council’s Modern House
Renewal Subcommittee, understands that current
house design limits the breadth of the policy.
“Right now we’re at a place where the university
really wants to be accommodating but it can only
do so much and it’s only willing to put its neck out
so far,” he says.
House renewal plans may make broader
mixed-gender housing a more viable option by
eliminating walk-through suites and creating gender neutral bathrooms, steps that Yale University
took in its recent renovations.
But as of now, living coeducationally at Harvard
remains an exception to the rule. “To just say
that we’re going to remove gender from the housing
conversation is not a reality given our space,”
McIntosh says. “We are not in that place.”

Last Sunday, FM braved the snowstorm and
traveled across the river to the Harvard Business
School for its Social Enterprise Conference, rated
number one of the top 12 conferences of 2009 by
Forbes Magazine.
While there, we sat down with Bill Drayton ’65,
chair and CEO of Ashoka International: Innovators
for the Public, one of the leading organizations that
fosters social entrepreneurship around the world.
His goal: breed a generation of “changemakers.”
1.
Fifteen Minutes: Now I must ask, since you
have a degree from both Harvard and Yale, if you
went to the Game, who would you root for?
Bill Drayton: Mercifully, I don’t like football.
Soccer is a different story. I’ll go with the words of
John Kennedy of this, “It might be said now that
I have the best of both worlds. A Harvard education
and a Yale degree.”
2.
FM: How is it coming back to your Alma
Mater? Obviously, judging by the  snow, some things
never change at Harvard.
BD: I taught at the Law School here before,
so it’s not my first time back. But I see that the
quality of the spirit hasn’t change in the students.
One of the things that has changed is the amount
of students interested in the citizen sector. When I
went here, that was a small minority, but that has
changed dramatically.
3.
FM: Some people say that right now, it’s sexy to
be a social entrepreneur—to be involved in microfinance,
non-profits, and the like. What do you say
to people that see this recent rise in civic activity as
being only fashionable and not sustainable?
BD: It’s a deep structural change, and it only
began, [fundamentally], around 1980. That’s a
radical change in 25 to 30 years. It took 300 years
for the business sector to grow at this rate, since
the 1700’s. It’s taken the citizen sector 30 years.
That’s not a fashion, that’s an entrepreneurial
change.
4. FM: You’ve been involved in many different
organizations across many different sectors
of society—from McKinsey [& Company] to the
Carter Administration. What’s has linked them
all for you?
BD: I went to India, as a sophomore at the
College, and that is what drove me. There, I
learned a tremendous amount. These are people
in one village, whom I am still close to, and the
decisions we make affect them all.
5.
FM: What role does Ashoka play in satisfying
this vision of change?
BD: We focus on the moment, when an idea
and an entrepreneur intersect in their life cycles.
Then, the entrepreneur steps out of the mold. No
one will support them, but Ashoka will. By year
five, our fellows, who we select as the most influential
entrepreneurs in a country, half of them
change social policy in their country. We make a
very small investment, but with this, you create a
huge social impact.
6. FM: What does Ashoka mean?
BD: It’s Sanskrit for “the act of absence of
sorrow,” but we base it off Ashoka the Great, the
Indian emperor, who reigned over India’s military
empire in the third century B.C. He led many
bloody military conquests, but afterward, he felt a
deep regret for his actions, so he put up edicts, in
stone, across the empire. They read, “the wars and
bloodshed were wrong and unjust.”
7.
FM: It would be refreshing to see that in the
present day, no?
BD: (laughs) Yes, it would. But more than that, he was a leader who was incredibly openminded
and tolerant, supported the building
of schools, and was one of the first great communicators.
8. FM: Looking at Ashoka, it has had incredible
success in developing social entrepreneurs. But what
is the key to this success—what are your greatest
strengths as an organization?
BD: We see the big steps that need to get done.
And now, we are collaborating, linking entrepreneurs
across borders. We see that an idea is
historic and we sit down and do what we do best:
change the world.
9. FM: Are there any challenges in moving toward
this goal?
BD: The challenge is how do we get to these
people—these [changemakers]. How do we get
to the influential schools in a country, how do
we get to [the] 15 to 20 most influential people
in every key country around the globe? If we do
that, we can tip the whole country.
10. FM: It seems that with your organization, you
are doing just this, which is remarkable. But what
are the limitations to this expansion?
BD: The things I’ve described are sharply
focused, and we have to be consistent in this
focus. Everyone in Ashoka has to be entrepreneurial,
everyone has to be collegial—meaning
they are innovative and [empowered]. It’s
a team of teams. We are growing at a rate of 35
percent last year, 80 percent next year, and that’s
all because we are in this historic moment: the
transformation of the citizen sector.
11.
FM: With all the work you do, from Ashoka
Chair, to other nonprofits like Community
Greens, to changing the world, how do you find
time to sleep?
BD: I don’t have to do all these things. We
have 100 incredibly talented people working
in Ashoka. We have almost 2,600 structured
fellows serving in the social sector around the
world. That is part of the transformation—I
don’t have to do it all because everyone is a
changemaker.
12. FM: We would like to think that change is possible
anywhere, but the reality of some places, like
Egypt with a repressive government suffocating the
citizen sector, is that it may not be possible. How
do you address these challenges?
BD: Look at Indonesia in the 1980’s. When
we went there, they said you couldn’t change it.
They said it was impossible. It was chaos from
war after war for decades. But we went there
and worked quietly to find those social entrepreneurs.
Over time, the hostility died down,
and the New Order collapsed. The first elected
President—he was an Ashoka nominator. The
first director—he was an Ashoka fellow.
13.
FM: When looking at these fellows, what are
the keys?
BD: Four words: Integrate and Recruit, and
Collegial and Entrepreneurial. These fellows
have to be able to spread their influence and
embolden others to change with them.
14.
FM: What, if you could give one point of
advice to us aspiring social “changemakers,”
would you tell us?
BD: It’s exceedingly simple. Give yourself
permission to do it. Why do so many people put
themselves in a box for 20 years after college,
when the world needs such changemakers? Give
yourself permission to make it happen, and then
all you have to do is persist.
15.
FM: And what advice would you give to Harvard,
as an institution, to spark change?
BD: If the University would do more to
bring out these leaders, to get this talent out
into the world to make change, we could see a
drastic transformation. It’s time to invert these
broken systems, it’s time to take down these
broken social institutions, and make them better.
Harvard should know this and should be
doing more to get its students out in the world
making change.

The Harvard Divinity School saw an 11 percent increase in total applicants this year, prompted in large part by the weak economy and HDS’s increased efforts to reach prospective students, said Maritza S. Hernandez, associate dean of student services at the school.
This represents the second consecutive year in which the school has reported significant increases in applicant numbers. Last year, the number of applicants increased by almost 15 percent from the previous year.
“The economy has played a role,” Hernandez said. “Usually during economic downturns, people sort of re-evaluate their lives. They take it as an opportunity to maybe follow their passion and do what they want, especially if they’ve been laid off.”
Though she predicted that the school will continue to see high applicant rates given the current state of the economy, there are no plans to increase the class size. 
“We’re at a level where we can provide the type of education that the Divinity School wants to provide,” Hernandez said. 
The only other significant increase in applications to HDS in recent times was in 2002, when Harvard reported a more than 11 percent jump in applicants following the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, said Hernandez. 
Similar increases were seen nationwide, with enrollment in seminaries increasing by 8 percent that year, according to the Association of Theological Schools. 
Besides the economic downturn, Hernandez credited the spike in applicants to the school’s increased efforts to promote HDS and its programs to prospective students. 
The admissions department reached out to more than 2,000 colleges and universities that did not traditionally produce HDS applicants. 
It also started a Diversity and Explorations Program in 2007, aimed at informing underrepresented racial and ethnic groups about opportunities in ministerial and theological education. These efforts informed “people who wouldn’t have [otherwise] thought about divinity schools,” Hernandez said. 
According to students, such efforts, along with the non-denominational stance of the school, contributed to its attractiveness. 
“HDS might be a good place because it is a program that is pretty open as opposed to Yale or the [University of Chicago],” said Matthew A. Lewis, a first-year student at HDS.

The Center for Brain Science is waiting for the arrival of the final parts of the first magnetic resonance imaging machine within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences before making it available for research and undergraduate study.
The MRI will serve projects from across the University, transferring much of Harvard’s brain-imaging research from the MRI facility at Massachusetts General Hospital in Charlestown to the Northwest Science building in Cambridge.  
While clinical research will continue to be conducted at the hospital, the new MRI will provide a closer option for non-clinical study. 
These long-awaited developments in the Neuroimaging Facility of the Center for Brain Science coincide with more difficult times for other FAS departments. 
Although the $3 million costs of the  machine were covered by external funding from grants, Harvard has allocated an abundant amount of space for the project. The Center for Brain Science will also be allowed to continue the search to fill two openings despite the FAS-wide freeze on most new hires.
Kenneth I. Blum, Executive Director of Harvard Center for Brain Science, said that Harvard has “given generous support for the MRI facility, which is a very complex machine and requires support.”
The MRI is just the beginning of the department’s plans for neuroimaging research—several rooms adjacent to the scanner have been left vacant to allow for future expansion, including a possible second scanner. 
The new, 3 tesla MRI—standard for non-clinical research—will provide a magnetic strength 60,000 times stronger than the earth’s magnetic field, Blum said.
The machine observes blood flows in the brain, allowing researchers to see the active brain regions of the subject. 
“It is the best technique we have for learning about the human brain that is non-invasive,” Blum said. 
Three years ago, MIT obtained the first of two MRI machines in a similar transition away from MGH Charlestown. According to Steven Shannon, an operations manager and MR research technologist at MIT, their primary machine now operates twelve hours a day, every day, to support MIT-affiliated research.
The Neuroimaging Facility at the Center for Brain Science has been in planning since the beginning of the decade. The space for the MRI was completed last semester—following the entire Center’s move into the Northwest Labs in July—and except for a few small parts, the MRI was ready by the end of January, according to Psychology Professor Randy L. Buckner.
Buckner will be one of the first researchers to use the scanner, observing how one’s memory systems can predict what one will do in the future. His subjects will navigate through a virtual environment, while under observation by the MRI.
In two weeks, when the last of the equipment arrives, the MRI will mark the beginning of a new era in neuroimaging research at Harvard. 
“This building is intended to be state of the art for decades to come,” Blum said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The final report of the Committee to Review the Undergraduate Council—informally called the Dowling Report—was released yesterday, calling for an extensive restructuring of the Council and the College’s student-faculty committee reporting system. 
The report, which has no decision-making power, marks the first time the UC had been formally reviewed by a student-faculty committee in its 25 year history. Neuroscience Professor John E. Dowling ’57—who chaired the review committee—also chaired the committee that established the UC in 1982.
“I think it’s going to start a necessary discussion, but it’s just starting,” said UC President Andrea R. Flores ’10.
The proposed structure includes three student-faculty committees: College and Residential Life, to be chaired by the Dean of the College; Undergraduate Education, to be chaired by the Dean of Undergraduate Education; and Student Services, to be chaired by the College’s Dean of Administration. 
Under this proposal, each of the College’s many student-faculty sub-committees would answer to one of the three primary committees. Each of the three advocacy committees that would replace SAC on the Council would also correspond to one of the three proposed student-faculty committees. 
If the proposals are adopted, the student-faculty committees would be given decision-making power, a step-up from the current advisory role they now serve. Under the proposal, the committee’s decision could be vetoed by the chair of the committee, but that veto could be overridden with a 2/3 vote.
The report also recommends increasing the size of the Council. 
Ten committee members were chosen in March 2008, and the body has convened 12 times since then. 
The five faculty members of the group were Dowling, Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, Associate Dean of the College Judith H. Kidd, Mather House Master Sandra R. Naddaff ’75, and Eric M. Nelson ’99, a government professor and former UC member. 
Students on the committee included two recent members of the UC: former UC Vice-President Randall S. Sarafa ’09 and Prithvi R. Shankar ’09, and three with no UC experience: Gee Hyun “Sussan” Lee ’09, Heidi E. Kim ’09, and Jamison A. Hill ’10, who is also The Crimson’s magazine chair. 
“My hope is that the report isn’t just seen as random musings from some individuals,” Sarafa said. “[People should] view this report with a certain amount of gravity.”
The report spent a little over three pages addressing the committee’s resolutions—which were included with the committee’s unanimous approval—and a little over seven pages discussing issues on which they had been unable to reach a conclusion.
The introductory portion of the report warned: “It might appear that this report has been written prematurely, that insufficient firm and detailed recommendations are being provided.” 
It went on to defend the release of the report, citing the fact that two committee members are on leave for the spring and that four students on the committee will graduate in June.
Former SAC Chair Jon T. Staff ’10 said he was disappointed by the report’s ambiguity. 
“I had high hopes that the Dowling Report would layout a specific and obtainable path to move forward,” Staff said.
The back-and-forth debate that the document addresses after its resolutions, Staff said, “has been going on formally and informally for a long time. Really all they did was write those down for us.”
Dowling defended the report, saying he thought it brought up issues that would be helpful to both the UC and the College.
“It turned out to be more difficult than I thought it would be when we started digging into it,” he said.
Several members of the committee said they considered the proposed hierarchical committee structure to be one of the most significant recommendations in the report.
The Dowling Report also recommended that the UC’s Finance Committee consist of approximately eight to ten members, who would serve on a rotating basis. 
According to the UC Web site, FiCom currently has 14 members.
“It would make sense to make FiCom smaller, because it would give more reps the opportunity to work with advocacy and I think a lot of students run for the UC to be a part of the advocacy side of things,” said Flores, who spent her UC career in FiCom.

The swearing-in of new leadership and debate over development plans in the nearby Silver Maple Forest brought both celebration and contention to last night’s Cambridge City Council meeting. Following the resignation of Vice Mayor Brian P. Murphy ’86-’87 last month, Larry Ward was chosen to fill the vacancy on the council. Councillor Sam Seidel was elected by unanimous vote of the Council—though one councillor was not in attendance—to take over as Vice-Mayor at last night’s meeting. Both were then given the oath of office by City Clerk led by Margaret Drury.After the ceremonies, many Cambridge residents remained to debate plans for development in the Silver Maple Forest in neighboring Belmont, what residents referred to as one of the few remaining open spaces in an urban environment.The plans would sanction the construction of a 40B residential housing complex, intended to provide “low or moderate income” housing. Residents at the meeting said that the affected communities—Belmont, Arlington, and Cambridge—might see more harm than good come of the proposed development.They cited potential environmental and public health concerns as reasons for the Council to pass a resolution that would put a hold on any permits requested by the developer, Pennsylvania-based O’Neill Properties. Building on the small river floodplain forest could exacerbate the existing drainage and flooding problems of the area, said Terre Greene, an environmental health specialist from John Snow Consulting in Boston. The flooding and contaminated water exposure would put residents at risk for mold, mildew and pest problems, which could trigger asthma and other respiratory problems, he said. “It is a difficult issue,” Seidel said, explaining that the Council would have limited influence in the matter. “Although the project has serious implications for Cambridge, it is fundamentally a Belmont decision.” Councilor Craig A. Kelley proposed two amendments to the resolution in an effort to secure some Cambridge input in the matter.He requested a joint meeting of the Cambridge and Belmont Conservation Committees—which will assess the project from an environmental perspective—and called for the Belmont City Manager to report back to the City Council on any decisions on the issue.—Staff writer Danella H.

The College’s Admissions and Financial Aid office will cut its travel budget next year by fifty percent, eliminating virtually all non-local high school visits, Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said in an interview yesterday. The scale-down—the admissions office’s response to a Faculty of Arts and Sciences-mandated budget cut of 15 percent for all units—comes two years after Harvard announced an end to its Early Admissions program. At the time, Fitzsimmons stressed the office’s commitment to increasing outreach and recruitment efforts for underrepresented groups, given the opening in the admissions timetable. Fitzsimmons said that admissions officers will now be occupying their time with e-mailing and telephoning prospective applicants identified by the College Board, rather than traveling. “Because we will be contacting people in a more robust way in the mail and online, we believe we will be more effective rather than less effective because we are going directly to the individuals,” Fitzsimmons said. Cutting back on high school visits has been on the table for some time now, said Fitzsimmons. He said that these visits are only sparsely attended and attracting promising applicants in this setting is “the random luck of the draw.”“This [cutback] actually gives us opportunity to start recruiting in a way that we think is more competitive,” Fitzsimmons said. “Our own focus groups have increasingly made the argument that the school visit has become less and less important.” Fitzsimmons said that joint travel trips—attended by larger numbers of students, parents, and counselors—have proven more effective in attracting prospective applicants. He added that Harvard will continue to visit 127 cities with along with Georgetown, the University of Pennsylvania, Duke, and Stanford. When asked if he was worried that these cuts would hurt Harvard’s perception of accessibility, Fitzsimmons acknowledged that this is “always a concern,” but said that this was one of the purposes of joint recruiting trips.  Teaming up with these colleges may help attract students who might not attend an information session only for Harvard, Fitzsimmons said. Joint trips with Princeton and the University of Virginia to target students from lower income backgrounds are still on the books for November. Student-staffed recruitment trips sponsored by the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative and the Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program will also remain intact. The admissions office will also encourage more one-on-one contact between regional officers and high school counselors in their newsletter, Fitzsimmons said. And the Harvard alumni network will take on an increased role aiding admissions officers, said Harvard Director of Financial Aid Sally C. Donahue. “We hope that the fact that Dean Smith and President Faust have made such a firm and inspiring commitment to financial aid will be a strong, clear message that whoever you are and whatever need you have, Harvard should be on your list,” Fitzsimmons said. “We think that message will be an enormous help.” Fitzsimmons said it will be tempting for people to pin any change in next year’s applicant numbers on one factor—such as decreased recruitment—but that without a careful analysis of all contributing forces, such a conclusion would not be accurate. He suggested a counter-effect in the record applicant numbers in recent years, a statistic that would discourage students from applying.In an additional effort to cut costs, the admissions office will also scale back on the size of information packets mailed to prospective applicants. The packets will still contain a copy of the common application and Harvard supplement—for the ten percent of students who do not apply to Harvard online—but much of the additional information will now be moved online.—Staff writer Jillian K. Kushner can be reached at kushner@fas.harvard.edu.

The creation of a library task force charged with developing recommendations to improve the strength and efficiency of the University’s library system, was announced by Harvard University Provost Steven E. Hyman on Friday.Since John Harvard donated his private collection to the College in 1638, Harvard’s library network has grown organically over a very long period of time, which has led to a high level of decentralization, according to Director of the Harvard University Library Robert Darnton ‘60. The structure of the current library system, which encompasses 75 separate institutions, a vast array of electronic resources, and multiple preservation labs and archival collections, has made it difficult to effectively coordinate services and adapt to technological innovations.While some branches of the libraries—such as the law, business and medical school libraries—are autonomous entities, other services, such as the Office of Information Services are centralized.  Though the system’s organizational structure has been a concern before, the economic crisis has provided the impetus for library officials to rethink ways of increasing efficiency to meet budgetary constraints. Still, those involved with the project do not see it as a cost-cutting exercise. “The purpose as I understand it is to make a great library greater, to turn the crisis into an opportunity to do things better,” said Darnton. Under the chairmanship of Steven Hyman, a 19-person task force comprised of university faculty and library staff from diverse academic backgrounds will prepare a set of recommendations to the President and the Council of Deans.  Their recommendations will address the overall structure of the library system, possible technological changes, and ways to address the overlap of library services. “This is an opportunity to craft a different approach to the management of our libraries, one that takes into account the increasing interest in interdisciplinary research,” said Librarian of Harvard College Nancy M. Cline. “We need to better understand our colleagues’ needs, and we need to better understand how our users’ changing needs can be met.”While the task force plans to make significant progress by summer, there is currently no deadline set for the final recommendations.“We are at a turning point in the history of the library, but the exact place towards which it will turn is not yet clear,” said Darnton.

Harvard’s multi-million dollar Allston development fund has been all but wiped out by the financial crisis, University officials said last week—likely scuttling the hopes of some Harvard faculty and administrators that its money could be diverted toward their own strapped budgets.
The strategic infrastructure fund, an annual 0.5 percent levy on Harvard’s endowment created in 2002 to support capital projects in Allston, may fall short even of future expenses demanded by existing plans, due to a projected 30 percent drop in the endowment’s value this fiscal year.
Planned spending from the SIF had assumed a long-term average growth rate of 8.25 percent on the endowment—a target that Harvard would fail to meet given this year’s endowment return, said University President Drew G. Faust in an interview last week.
In recent years, the University has assumed long-term debts to finance property acquisitions and development planning in Allston, to be paid for in part by funds from the SIF.
Last year, the SIF contributed $168 million toward projects such as land purchases, construction, and community benefits.
Previous funding assumptions “must be reassessed and are unlikely to cover the same things in scale we initially envisioned for Allston,” said Harvard Chief Financial Officer Daniel S. Shore.
He added that the University will not renege upon any previous financial commitments.
University Provost Steven E. Hyman said that after subtracting funds already pledged for interest payments and other expenditures, the cash flow from the SIF is all but accounted for, with little money, if any, left over for discretionary purposes.
The current status of the SIF—which University officials voted in 2005 to extend through 2031—contrasts with a misconception perpetuated among some faculty members that slowing down construction in Allston would create a “windfall” for other projects by freeing up SIF funds, Hyman said.
At a Dec. 9 Faculty meeting, University President Drew G. Faust suggested that money previously allocated for Allston development could now be redirected, in response to a question from one professor.
“Depending on our decision about the planning and pacing of Allston over the next period of time,” Faust said, “we may decide that here are other necessary uses for those monies given the financial challenges we are facing at all levels.”
Harvard administrators formally announced their intention to slow down construction for the first science complex in Allston last month, citing financial pressures on all revenue streams. 
Planning for the rest of Allston development, which has been slated to take place over 50 years, will also be slowed.

Harvard Law School will begin a free summer test-preparation program for low-income college students in an attempt to boost socioeconomic diversity at law schools and to create a template curriculum for other schools to use.But whether the Training and Recruitment Initiative for Admission to Leading Law Schools, a joint effort with NYU Law School and Advantage Testing, will accomplish its goal of increasing socioeconomic diversity depends on whether or not other law schools adopt the system since only 20 students will gain entry to this summer’s pilot session. As of Sunday, at least 5000 applications had been received for the 20 slots, said Philip Lee, a Harvard Law School admission officer who administers the program.People associated with the program have described it as a chance for low-income students to level the playing field with more competitive peers who have been “immersed” in an environment that fosters the critical reading and thinking skills essential to high LSAT scores.“Everyone has an opportunity to attend what some people might call the pinnacle of education, and common sense tells us the credentials required to attend are only going to be achieved when you have tremendous opportunities.” said Arun Alagappan, the president of Advantage Testing and one of the principal financial sponsors of the program. “We’re trying to level the playing field by increasing opportunities.”Students will participate in the usual hallmark activities of LSAT test-prep services, including logic games and argumentation, but the program will also draw on the sizable resources of Harvard and NYU to bring in legal scholars and practitioners to address the students.Even though the program is closely associated with Harvard and NYU, with both schools providing some funding, it is not aimed at funneling students to those institutions. Rather, it tries to make students competitive applicants to a wide range of top-tier law schools, said Lee.In addition to not charging a fee, the program also offers a $3,000 stipend to offset the lost wages of a summer job.Though similar programs provide free or low-cost test prep services to needy students, none lend the institutional imprimatur of a prestigious law school such as Harvard or NYU—which might explain the large number of applicants it received in its first year.Applicants will be selected in a two-part process that considers the student’s academic record, background, and financial need. The final stage of the application process closed Sunday. The inaugural program will be held at Harvard Law School this summer. Next year, the students will be housed at NYU, and the program will alternate locations each year after that.—Staff writer Elias J. Groll can be reached at egroll@fas.harvard.edu.

The UK Consulate in Cambridge has expanded a one-year-old partnership with the Harvard Kennedy School that will allow students to potentially guide international policy. 
The consulate will serve as the client for four groups of students—up from just one last year—in the Masters in Public Policy program at the school as the students work on their Policy Analysis Exercise, a two semester project that marks the capstone of their studies. 
Joseph Pickerill, the vice consul who will present policy issues for the students to analyze, said that the Consulate’s primary reason for establishing the collaboration with the Kennedy School the unique wealth of intellectual capital it offered. 
“The PAEs provide the perfect way to tap into the high level thinking at the Kennedy School,” Pickerill said.
Eric B. Rosenbach, an executive director at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, said that the collaboration started in 2007 when he met with Phil Budden, the Consul–General for New England. 
The first project under the partnership—looking at the use of language by political leaders—was presented to Prime Minister Gordon Brown on his visit to the Kennedy School last year.
“The UK Consulate has brought serious policy makers to meet students and their faculty advisors, like the current UK Ambassador to the UN and the Head of the UK’s Afghanistan and Pakistan policy department,” Rosenbach said.
Yll Bajraktari, a student who is working with the consulate to analyze the challenges of long-term international commitment to Afghanistan, said that the consulate took them to London and Brussels and arranged 22 meetings with international representatives at the NATO headquarters.
Claire E. Applegarth, another of the students working with the consulate, said the partnership has given her group much assistance along the way.
“It provides access to key research contacts,” she said. 
“It is also exciting to know that our product, if useful, can actually help guide policy.”
With the final drafts of the projects due at the end of March, Pickerill said his office is “busy working with the students and testing their conclusions.” 
He added that the consulate plans to continue the partnership in future years. 
“Not only do we get insights from bright students, but we get to engage more widely with the Harvard community,” he said.

Insurance companies often treat mental and physical illnesses differently, and those seeking mental health services wait a decade on average before receiving treatment, U.S. Representative Patrick Kennedy said at the Institute of Politics yesterday.Kennedy, a Rhode Island Democrat, spoke on the need to reform health care systems to better address the need for affordable addiction and mental health treatment.The event began with an introduction by Minnesota Congressman Jim Ramstad, who talked about finding himself in a Sioux Falls jail in 1981 before finally seeking treatment for his addiction.According to Ramstad, over 26 million people currently suffer from addictions—only 16 million of whom have health insurance. But even those with insurance usually can not get coverage for mental health. Ramstad called mental health provisions the “single most ineffective policy” in the health care system—or, as he called it, a “sick care system.”Kennedy cited numerous deaths discussed on the news daily, and then asked the audience, “Do you ever see the suicides? Do you ever read about them?” He also emphasized the many statistics on prevalence of mental health issues, pointing out that some people believe that drugs and alcohol are a lifestyle people have chosen. “Is this something someone would want to choose for themselves?” he asked the audience.Often, teenagers who suffer from mental illness are less successful in school, and wind up dropping out and falling into drugs and alcohol, Kennedy said. Kennedy also told the audience that over 50 percent of foster children wind up in prison. When asked what advice he would give to people trying to pick themselves up after falling into addiction, Kennedy replied, “Take things one day at a time, slow down...find others and realize you’re not alone in this world.”Kennedy stressed that there is much more work to be done. He mentioned his uncle President John F. Kennedy ’40, whom he invoked as a champion for civil rights, before calling on America to stand up for the civil rights of those with mental illness.

Beverly Tatum, President of Spelman College, joined Harvard students yesterday to discuss issues of racial identity and education.  Tatum is the author of “Choosing to be Black, the Ultimate White Privilege,” an essay about the decision of one white student to check the African American box on his college application. This year’s freshman class was required to read Tatum’s essay for freshman orientation. Tatum’s visit was intended to be a continuation of the conversations that took place in the fall. One issue addressed during the discussion was the ability of students of different races to identify with texts that only dealt with black and white racial issues. According to Assistant Director of the Harvard Foundation Loc Truong, this was also an issue brought up after the freshman discussions. “I think there were unfinished conversations during freshman week and I wanted to see where else they could lead,” said audience member Alyssa T. Yamamoto ’12. “I wanted to ask about the Asian perspective, I didn’t feel that was addressed.”Tatum said that she believed that the challenge was to create multiple conversations, because one conversation about race would be too broad. But she stressed the importance of creating an inclusive environment. “This is an important conversation that we don’t talk about much. It’s about the multiple identities we have and how we embrace them,” Tatum said in an interview before the event.And students did not hold back from raising the questions on their minds. The conversation touched on issues that ranged from the importance of appearance in identifying race to the financial difficulties for historically black colleges and universities. “One reason for this event was so students can feel more comfortable talking about a topic whether they agree with it or not,” said Truong.Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 asked Tatum to compare the dialogues on race she has had at single-gender and single-race colleges to the one at Harvard. Tatum answered that other factors like religion add to the diversity of opinions at single-race colleges like Spelman. She also said that people could be put in groups or separated in ways to create an atmosphere conducive to discussion.“The willingness to have difficult conversations is the key,” Tatum said, “If you avoid things you don’t learn that [they] can be liberating.”—Staff writer Jillian K.

Three days. Four races. Four school records. All broken.When junior co-captain Alexandra Clarke returned from this weekend’s Ivy League Championships at Nassau County Aquatic Center, not only did she have four medals around her neck, an Ivy League title to her name, and three NCAA provisional qualifying times, she also held Harvard’s records for four different events.“She has a lot of guts,” Crimson coach Stephanie Morawski said. “She is a great leader in and out of the pool. She has tremendous dedication and commitment to the sport and her teammates.”At Ivies this weekend, Clarke proved just how much mettle she has. Swimming in the first individual event of the championship, the 500-yard freestyle, Clarke saw two of her teammates, sophomores Kate Mills and Christine Kaufmann, break the Harvard school record in their heats. With success on her mind, Clarke went on to beat their times while placing second in the final with a time of 4:48.25—less than two seconds behind Princeton rival Alicia Aemisegger.With her first school record broken, and her first provisional bid to the 2009 NCAA Swimming Championship secured, Clarke went into Friday ready to attack yet again. In her second race, the 1000-yard freestyle, she not only destroyed the Crimson record by six seconds, but she also won the first ever Ivy title for Harvard in this event. Clarke would later win the first 800-yard freestyle relay title for the Crimson in 21 years with the help of Mills, sophomore Katherine Pickard, and freshman Catherine Zagroba, again breaking the school record. In her last race of the meet, Clarke would again fall to Aemisegger, placing second in the 1650-yard freestyle. And yet, Clarke would get another NCAA qualifying berth, and for the fourth time, a Crimson record.Even though Clarke already boasts a prolific career at Harvard that includes the 2008 Sharon Beckman Award for the Most Outstanding Swimmer, beating out Princeton for the first Crimson Ivy title in four years was the icing on the cake. And yet, contrary to what many think, Clarke’s success did not come easily. After having four knee surgeries and then injuring her shoulder at the end of her sophomore year, Clarke has worked hard with both the Harvard training center and her doctors in Phoenix to get to this day. “I’ve been injured for the past two seasons so it was nice to finally [win Ivies],” Clark said. “Now I am able to compete and train and everything. It is definitely a big relief.”Her ability to bounce back, according to her coach and teammates, is what makes Clarke so deserving of fame. “She just kept going through rehab and staying positive about [her injury],” Morawski said. “There were definitely days when her pain was above the threshold but she kept swimming anyways. It was impressive.” But despite the comeback kid story and the records she now holds, one of Clarke’s most important characteristics is her ability to lead.“Aside from the amount of points she contributed…she is a leader in and out of the water as a captain, helping to mentor the younger swimmers, rallying her teammates to win,” Morawski said. “I think that sometimes those things count more than the points in the water.”“She’s an invaluable member,” Zagroba said. “She is good at making us work together as a team, dealing with conflict—not that there ever is any conflict. She is a good model. She sets a good example by how she swims.”In three weeks, Clarke will again test her speed at this year’s NCAAs at Texas A&M, but this time, she won’t have to lead. “It’s just going to be me and Kate Mills, so it’s going to be a totally different atmosphere,” Clarke said. “I hope I swim better. The last two years I haven’t swam as well at NCAAs than at Ivies, so hopefully this year will be different.”Even with such success, Clarke knows it can only get better.“We only graduate [two seniors this year], and we are getting in a really talented class of swimmers,” she said. “Everyone is very excited to get faster and win again next year.”

Since the Beanpot in early February, the Harvard men’s ice hockey team has been rolling. The squad has gone undefeated in its past six contests and looks like a team ready to make some serious noise in the ECAC playoffs. A major reason for the Crimson’s success is the play of junior Doug Rogers. The 6’1, 195-pound center has recorded a point in each of the last five games and leads Harvard with four goals in that stretch. “He’s our go-to-guy,” co-captain Jimmy Fraser said. “When he’s playing well, the team’s playing well.” Rogers has had quite the career for the Crimson. Among active Harvard skaters, Rogers ranks first with 28 goals and 77 points. This year, the junior leads the team with eight scores and 21 points. However, the value that Rogers brings to his team is understated by his season totals. The center is important to the Crimson because changes in the strength of his play seem to mirror the success of the team. When the center is hot, the team wins. When Rogers struggles, so does Harvard. At the beginning of this year, Rogers had a hard time finding the net and he did not record his first goal until late January, when he scorched Dartmouth with a hat trick. Before the Big Green contest, the Crimson was 4-11-3. Since Harvard faced Dartmouth, Rogers has scored eight goals, and the Crimson is 5-3-3. In the last month, Rogers has made more of an effort to get pucks on goal. He leads the team with 99 shots. “I just kind of stuck with it and kept shooting, trying to get my body to the net, my stick on the ice,” Rogers said. “Sometimes it’s just better to shoot than to pass.” Last year, Rogers had another noteworthy effort at the end of the season. Not surprisingly, Harvard played well during that stretch. In five ECAC playoff contests, the junior recorded seven points, and the Crimson advanced all the way to the ECAC Championship Game. “[Rogers is] a huge asset for us,” Fraser said. “In terms of leadership, a lot of guys look up to him.” Before coming to Harvard, Rogers was drafted by the New York Islanders in the fourth round of the 2006 NHL Entry Draft. The prospect is a well-rounded player known for his shooting ability and passing vision. “The kid can shoot the puck,” Fraser said. “He’s a playmaker, too. He always knows where his linemates are. In the offensive zone...he’ll find you.” Rogers is also praised for his intelligent play. “Having good hockey sense, playing more so with my head than anything else...that’s probably the best part of my game,” Rogers said. The Crimson’s hot streak over the past month is shockingly reminiscent of the 2008 team’s late-season comeback. Last year, Harvard went 5-0-1 to finish the regular season after a one-goal loss to BC in the Beanpot. In the playoffs, the squad made the finals but fell to Princeton 4-1. The Crimson is hoping its momentum can take it deep into the playoffs in 2009 and once again the Beanpot tournament may be the source of the team’s run. Although Harvard lost both Beanpot games last month, the Crimson almost took down national powerhouses, Boston College and Boston University, which were ranked No. 15 and No. 1 at the time, respectively.. “I’d say the Beanpot was definitely the turn around,” Fraser said. “[It] was a huge motivation booster and instilled confidence in a lot of our younger players.” The Crimson has also shown it can compete with the ECAC’s top teams. Harvard took down second-place Cornell three weeks ago and beat third-place Princeton, ranked No. 6 nationally, this past weekend. In the Big Red game Rogers notched two assists, and against the Tigers he tied up the game with a first period goal. Rogers also had a two-score performance against St. Lawrence, which sits in fourth-place in the ECAC. This weekend, the fifth-seeded Crimson will face last-place Brown in a best-of-three series in the opening round of the ECAC playoffs. In two games against the Bears this season, Rogers did not score and Harvard tied both contests. If Rogers nets one this time around, the final result will probably be different. —Staff writer Jake I. Fisher can be reached at jifisher@fas.harvard.edu.

As the Ivy League entered the crunch part of its schedule, few players have stepped up and delivered like Drew Housman.The senior point guard and four-year starter for the Harvard men’s basketball team has been one of the best players in the league over the past couple weekends and his play could not have come at a better time for the Crimson.Housman scored in double figures in each of Harvard’s last six games, during which it has gone an impressive 3-3, including thrilling last minute wins at Penn and against league-leader Cornell.It has been those two marquee wins that the Calabasas, Calif. native has been most on top of his game. He torched the Quakers for a game-high 22 points and dished out five assists—the last of which found junior guard Jeremy Lin for the game-winning three pointer. A week later, he dropped 20 points against the Big Red in a one-point win. This came one night after a 10-point and career-high six steal performance in a victory over Columbia.“Drew is an amazing player,” captain guard Andrew Pusar said. “He’s been great for four years and he is such a fantastic all-around player. He leads our team, anchors our defense, and is the catalyst for our offense. We trust him and we know with the ball in his hands, we will be in great shape.”The Ivy League has recognized his strong performances. In the past three weeks, he was named to the league’s weekly honor roll twice before being chosen as Ivy League Player of the Week for the most recent set of games.This has been quite a turnaround from earlier in the season. In his first three years, Housman averaged nearly 32 minutes per game, but for most of the beginning of this season, he saw his playing time cut. In a double overtime loss to Northeastern at home in December, he did play a season-high 37 minutes and hit two threes in the final minute of regulation to tie the score. But in the upset Boston College in January, he played just 14 minutes and in the first three Ivy League games, he played only 37 combined minutes while contributing a total of 11 points.That all seems like ancient history now as Ancient Eight play has rolled on; Housman has played at least 30 minutes in the past seven games and has rarely stepped off the court in the second half of matches.After averaging double figures in scoring for each of his first three seasons, his numbers are down to 9.3 points per game so far. But with two games left, he can reach a double-digit average with a minimum of 39 points overall. A high-scoring weekend would also push him up the program’s career scoring list, where he currently sits tied for 13th place with former two-time captain Dale Dover ’71 with 1201 points, having recently passed former teammates Matt Stehle ’06 and Jim Goffredo ’07.On the other end of the court, his defense has been superb recently too, especially last weekend. Against Cornell, he clearly got the better of reigning league Player of the Year Louis Dale. Housman led an excellent harassing effort all night to keep the clamps on the explosive guard in one of the biggest wins in his time at Harvard in his final home game—a fitting end to his time at Lavietes Pavilion.“It was nice to get a win against a team that’s going to the NCAA Tournament,” Housman said. “Especially on Senior Night when we had a good crowd with lots of family and friends and some people flew out a long way to see us.”After three seasons of posting more turnovers than assists, he has an excellent ratio this season of 70 assists against 37 turnovers. And with the win over the Big Red, the Crimson picked up its fifth league win of the season and reached the .500 mark overall.With victories at Brown or Yale, Harvard will have its first winning season since 2001-02, and also be at .500 in Ivy play for the first time since 2004-05—the year before Housman arrived. If he keeps up his excellent play of late, the team must like its chances. “Drew has been sensational for us for the last three weeks or so,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “There has been a real purpose to how he has played. Sometimes you see that with seniors, they’re on a mission to finish strong and finish right. He’s leaving his mark on this program and wants to go out in a blaze of glory.”—Staff writer Ted Kirby can be reached at tjkirby@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Meet Shannon Flahive, track and field athlete extraordinaire. 
In the classroom or around campus, she’s just like any other Harvard student. But on the track, this soft-spoken senior transforms into one of the most versatile competitors the Crimson track program has seen in a very long time. 
After four years of hard work, setbacks, and success, Flahive’s commitment to the track program culminated in a first-place finish in the pentathlon at last weekend’s Indoor Heptagonals.
Already the school record holder, Flahive won the event with a personal best and ECAC-qualifying 3,650 points. Her performance on the first day of competition set the tone for the weekend, as the women’s team ended up finishing a respectable third place among Ivy competitors. 
“I think that it’s been a long time coming,” Flahive says. “I’ve been new to the multi events. I was a really late starter, so my technical events have taken a long time to develop. It was just a matter of putting together five decent events.”
“Shannon has always been a great competitor and athlete for us,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky says. “I was very pleased with the way she performed.”
Naturally a sprinter, Flahive earned 976 of her 3,650 points in the 60-meter hurdles, clocking in at 8.69 seconds. 
“I’m definitely a sprinter and hurdler,” she says. “That’s definitely my strength. I had to learn that you can’t use your speed and strength directly in the technical events. It’s more about relaxing and visualizing. It’s a very different mindset.” 
Solid showings in the high jump, long jump, and the 800-meter run sealed the deal for the athlete, making just her second appearance in the pentathlon at Heps. 
Flahive became the first Crimson woman to win the event since Marquita Patterson took it back in 1982.
“It feels great,” Flahive says. “We always had a pretty strong multi tradition, so it feels really good to be able to put it together senior year and come out with a win.”
Unlike many of her teammates and competitors, Flahive did not get into the track and field circuit until junior year of high school. 
Originally a soccer star, the Littleton, Co. native was actually recruited by the high school track coach to run for the team.
“I got to the point where [soccer] just wasn’t stimulating enough,” Flahive says. “That spring, I joined the track team. It was kind of a crazy move, because I was supposed to go to college to play soccer. That was going to be my ticket in, but I needed a change.”
Flahive’s bold move ended up paying large dividends. 
In a matter of just two years, the athlete relied on raw talent to own school records in the 100-meter dash, 200-meter dash, pentathlon, and heptathlon, to name a few. 
More importantly, Flahive earned offers from several Division I schools before settling on Harvard.
“I had to sell myself pretty hard, since recruiting season is junior spring,” Flahive says. “Track coaches are really perceptive, and they saw that I had a lot of good marks.”
And though Flahive has been blessed with athletic success all her life, it hasn’t always come easy for the track star, who had to handle unforeseen injuries and learn new technical events in college. 
A series of hamstring injuries prevented Flahive from competing in the pentathlon during her freshman and sophomore years. 
This, however, would be a blessing in disguise.
Flahive was told by assistant coaches Will Thomas and Matt Chisam that lost time would not prevent her from winning, as long as she regained confidence. Touching on all five events just once a week, Flahive adopted Thomas’ “less is more” mantra. 
“[Coach Thomas] said that you can only get so good technically at an event when you’re training for five different events,” Flahive says. “We train mainly for our endurance and speed. He tells us that when it’s game time, we just have to compete, and it’s really all about confidence.” 
With the indoor season close to wrapping up and the outdoor season on the near horizon, Flahive will have a few more opportunities to show her abilities on the track. 
But the talented athlete doesn’t want her accomplishments on the track to be her only legacy.
“I hope that people will look at me as someone who’s competed through a lot of injuries and brought it together her senior year,” Flahive says. “I want to help the younger kids understand what the program is really about. It’s not about them, it’s about the whole team.”
Next year, Flahive will bring her competitive spirit and unmatched work ethic to a Boston-based consulting firm, Cambridge Associates, but don’t expect her to hang up her spikes just yet.
“I’m staying in Boston and considering continuing to train as a hurdler,” Flahive says. “It’ll be great to stick around and stay involved with the program. We’re just going up from here. It’s just getting started.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The expectations seemed too large for a first-year wrestler.
Walter Peppelman (20-11, 11-7 dual matches) had big shoes to fill this year, following junior co-captain J.P. O’Connor and 2004 National Champion Jesse Jantzen in the 149 lb. weight class.
However, the shoes seem to fit, as the freshman grappler has dominated opponents all year, often overwhelming competitors 17-0 en route to leading the team with eight technical falls. Peppelman is also close behind O’Connor (27-2, 16-1) and fellow junior co-captain Louis Caputo (27-4, 14-1), as well as sophomore NCAA qualifier Corey Jantzen (12-1, 5-0), with four falls so far this season.
“With Walter, he’s just as good as other guys coming in—Corey, Louis, J.P.,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss says. “The only thing he’s missing is that one win that says ‘Okay, I can do this.’”
Peppelman notes the difficulties of being a freshman, making the adjustment on and off the mat.
“It’s a big transition between high school and college wrestling,” he says. “I have been really working to improve my hand-fighting skills, my bottom wrestling, and the mental aspect of the sport.”
However the rookie is modest, bringing much more to the table than he acknowledges.
“Obviously he’s very talented, but his enthusiasm [stands out],” Weiss admires. “To this day, I’ve yet to see him have a bad practice. I’ve never had to tell him to pick it up.”
Peppelman is driven in his own right, with ambitions of qualifying for the NCAA tournament and becoming an All-American. While the rookie prepares for the lofty goals he has set for himself, he is grounded and ‘family’ oriented, relying on his teammates and coaches.
“So far, the closeness and support of the Harvard wrestling family has been one of the major highlights of my college career,” Peppelman says.
For a freshman, it is easy and almost natural to hang in the background and not contribute as an active voice on the team, especially surrounded by star grapplers O’Connor and Jantzen as workout partners. Then again, Peppelman is not the average freshman.
“The biggest thing I see is his leadership,” Weiss says. “He’s not afraid to open his mouth. He’ll call himself out, too. He’s really added a lot, and allows other people to open their mouths as well.”
The confidence and leadership Peppelman exhibits stems from a combination of talent and experience. He began wrestling 13 years ago in first grade when his friend persuaded him to try it, and the sport has proven to be an ideal outlet for an energetic grappler.
“[Peppelman] is constantly going,” Weiss says. “He’s real difficult to wrestle when he’s on top of you. He’s in great shape, constantly pushing himself, and brings a lot of intensity to the room.”
The rookie standout was a rare three-time state finalist in high school in Pennsylvania, finishing third at the PIAA Championships as a freshman, second as a sophomore and senior, and claiming the title as a junior. After high school, he was considering programs like the University of Pennsylvania, Cornell University, and Lehigh University. But ultimately, the draw of Harvard’s education and atmosphere proved too much, as the grappler has found a truly supportive environment.
“I chose to go to Harvard because I would have two of the best workout partners in the country [O’Connor and Jantzen], I loved the coaching staff, and I felt at home on the campus,” Peppelman says. “Not to mention it’s the number one academic institution in the world.”
The fit seems natural for Peppelman and the rookie class. After benefitting from such high-level training and opportunities to compete right away, Peppelman and his classmates have tried to give something back, bringing a new focus and determination to a team that is only growing stronger as the EIWA Championships approach.
“Nowadays in practice, I don’t have to say much...[I] let them do their thing and what I’ve seen is just [great],” Weiss says. “I’m going to attribute that to the freshmen and the chemistry they’ve added coming in.”
As for this weekend, Weiss believes that Peppelman is “saving his best for last.”
The coach pointed to the rookie’s past success in big high school matches as an indicator that Peppelman’s “big step” may be coming soon. 
The freshman may surprise a few people in the season’s final tournaments, as Weiss hints, “I’m convinced he’s going to get more than one big win [at EIWAs].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
March Madness is in full swing for freshmen this week, as “friends” show their true colors, unsuspecting victims are thrown out of blocking groups, and a general sense of drama ensues. For the six freshmen of the women’s water polo team—a group that deals with conflict in the pool on a regular basis—there will be no tension come blocking day. Sitting around a dining hall table in Eliot House, the six girls shake their head in unison at the possibility of blocking together.“We don’t want to add roommate drama to the team dynamic,” mentions Monica Zdrojewski, who has 14 goals on the year.“I’d say we already spend a big chunk of our time with each other,” adds goalkeeper Laurel McCarthy, who has recorded 10 saves in a backup role thus far.In addition to dining together almost every day, the girls even occasionally have movie nights together. Zdrojewski, Devan Kennifer, Lizzie Abbott, and Shannon Purcell all hail from California, and although the future teammates did not get to know each other back in high school, they and fellow freshman Ita Barton-Kettleborough would finally formally meet one another at a reception on move-in day in September. “We all got along instantly,” says Purcell, who has 10 goals on the season.Although McCarthy missed out on the reception, as well as the California heritage, she quickly found her place in the group.Water polo represents a “family trait” for all five Americans, as each has either a father or an older sister passing on the genes.Conversely, Barton-Kettleborough, named Northern Division Rookie of the Week on Feb. 24, comes to Harvard from Manchester, England, and decided to take up the sport after seeing it played for the first time at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in her home city.The teammates are also quite similar in their reasons for attending Harvard. They cite the unique opportunity to play for assistant coach and former Olympian Ellen Estes Lee, who led the US to a silver and bronze medal in Sydney and Athens, respectively.In addition to the coaching staff, the rookies were deeply impressed with the team’s affability on their recruiting trips.“[The upperclassmen] made an effort to do a lot of things together as a team and get to know them very well,” co-captain Devon McLaughlin says.This feeling carried over to the fall, as the experienced upperclassmen have become mentors to the freshmen. “The upperclassmen have been great big sisters to this bunch,” Harvard coach Erik Farrar says.The six freshmen have constantly been able to seek advice from their eight veteran teammates regarding both the sport and college life in general.“The knowledge of the upperclassmen is so useful,” McCarthy remarks as her teammates adamantly concur.“Any problem you have, one of them has gone through the same thing,” adds Abbott, who has six scores this year.The team’s blossoming friendships away from the pool have impacted the group’s performance in the pool.“Your personality outside of the water also corresponds to the way you play,” Zdrojewski says.When Farrar posted the starting lineup two days before the opening match, the girls were shocked to see five of their names in the starting seven. The rookies were also quick to note that playing on Farrar’s team does not reflect any hierarchy, but rather a tactic used to get an advantage on the opponent.“I think [Farrar] is going for shock and awe,” Kennifer suggests. “The other teams haven’t seen us much…so they can’t prepare as much.”While Kennifer may currently be an unknown freshman, teams will begin to notice her if she continues her impressive offensive numbers. Kennifer has tallied 31 goals in her first 11 games.“It’s definitely awesome to find out that you’re going to start the game, but at the same time, I got so much more nervous and felt so much more pressure,” Zdrojewski remarks.“At the same time you felt a little bit of confidence as well, because your coach and the team had confidence in you,” Barton-Kettleborough adds. “It’s like a double edged sword,” she concludes, as Abbott chimes in simultaneously on the final word.The freshman girls look forward to building upon their teamwork and skills in their future seasons together.“I’m really looking forward to just being on the team with you guys for the next four years,” Barton-Kettleborough says sentimentally to her teammates.Despite blocking separately, the girls sit around the table knowing their friendship will remain strong, as their practices, nightly dinners, and team trips will allow them to spend plenty of time together when they are not all living together in the Yard.

As if living in the quad weren't bad enough.
Earlier this evening, Cabot House was notified of a "major card swipe outage in the House." As such, all card readers were "inoperative" for an unspecified amount of time.
One Cabot resident whined: I wouldn't have left for brain break if I'd gotten the email about the outage sooner and just dealt with the rumbling stomach.
Or, you could have just transferred.

Senior spring. A season of hope and opportunity.
Unless, that is, your industry of choice is holding talks called, "Fallen Sky." Today, the Shorenstein Center at the Kennedy School hosted New York Times media columnist David Carr, a man who knows a thing or two about rock bottom, to discuss the future of the journalism industry in the middle of the financial free fall.
All the Chicken Littles, it seems, have it right.
"As we know, big chunks of the sky have begun to fall," Carr said,  ticking off a national map of newspaper despair: Seattle, Denver, Detroit, Minneapolis, Philadelphia.
"I'm not going to through the dreary tick-tock...It really sucks out there. Let's just stipulate that."
The word, "gallows," came up. There was mentioning of "people whose heads are getting blown off."
The collective journalistic "ass is on fire," Carr said.
Read on after the jump for more dire proclamations about journalism's future--or lack thereof.
Reporters don't know who their friends are these days.
Google may not be helping with its decision to begin advertising on its Google News site.
"They scrape not only our content but our audience as well," Carr warned.
All that linking has got Carr down.
"If the host dies, you may have to pick up the phone. Are you read for that?" he warned bloggers.
He worries that while the internet is expanding audiences to unprecedented levels, sites like Facebook shrink reader's attention.
"Vanity media is like having this little yellow lab in the household. 'What about me? Aren't you going to update me?' How are you going to compete with that?"
Carr pooh-pooh-ed the potential for a charitable model to support the media, an idea floated by Slate's Jacob Weisberg last week.
"You have to think your funders go over your shoulder," he said. "What if the ox you're going to gore is them?"
But the advertising just isn't there. One of member of the Newhouse publishing clan, Carr said, told him that their ad base at the New Jersey Star-Ledger is a quarter of what is once was.
What should the press do? For starters, stop canceling its conventions.
"Would there be any more important time to come together and talk about 'Holy shit! What has happened to us?'" Carr asked.
And yet, looking toward places like India and its booming demand for news, Carr finds hope.
"I think, long-term, this is a great business to be in. It is just really disruptive, painful changes right now."
Okay, maybe not all that much hope.

Turns out your average  gun-toting, Bud-drinking, Nascar-loving Republican watches just as much—if not more—porn than their liberal counterparts.
HBS prof Benjamin Edelman reached the conclusion by following two-years' worth of credit card purchases from, um, "adult" sites. Props to the churchgoers who bought 0.1% less online porn on Sundays—and made up for the lost hours by spending more time on this preferred pastime during the week.
More salacious conclusions after the jump.
The McCain-Palin ticket carried the porn vote in the November elections. Brings a new level of meaning to "Drill, baby, drill!"
