After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former University President Larry Summers has withdrawn his name from consideration for the Chairmanship of the Federal Reserve, the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday afternoon.
“This is a complex moment in our national life,” Summers wrote in a letter to President Obama dated Sunday. “I have reluctantly concluded that any possible confirmation process for me would be acrimonious and would not serve the interests of the Federal Reserve, the Administration, or ultimately, the interests of the nation’s ongoing economic recovery.”
The economics professor, who was widely rumored to be Obama’s favored candidate to replace current Chair Ben S. Bernanke '75, issued the letter after sharing his decision with Obama in a phone call earlier on Sunday, according to the Journal.
In a statement, Obama said that he accepted the withdrawal of Summers, who served as director of the National Economic Council during Obama’s first presidential term.
“I will always be grateful to Larry for his tireless work and service on behalf of his country, and I look forward to continuing to seek his guidance and counsel in the future,” Obama said, calling Summers "a critical member of my team” during the financial crisis that began in the late 2000s.
Summers’s exit from the conversation surrounding the position makes Janet L. Yellen, the current vice chair of the Federal Reserve System’s Board of Governors, the clear frontrunner for the job. If nominated and confirmed, Yellen would be the first woman to serve as Fed Chair—one of the most powerful positions in the country.
Before the Journal’s article, Summers’s standing as the most likely nominee had in recent weeks solidified. Nikkei, a Japanese newspaper, reported last week that Obama would nominate Summers and that Obama was “in the final stages” for preparing such an announcement. The White House fired back, telling Reuters that Obama had not come to a final decision for the nomination.
But as speculation surrounding Summers’s potential nomination mounted, so did opposition to his appointment. On Friday, Congressman Jon Tester, a Democrat from Montana, became the third member of the Senate Banking Committee to publicly express his objection to the prospect of Summers’s leadership.
"Senator Tester believes we need a consensus builder to lead the Federal Reserve. He's concerned about Mr. Summers' history of helping to deregulate financial markets," Andrea Helling, a spokesperson for Tester, told Reuters.
In addition, more than 300 notable economists and policymakers, including Christina D. Romer, Jeffrey D. Sachs ’76, and Joseph E. Stiglitz, have voiced their support for Yellen in a public letter to Obama. Some of the letter’s signers, such as Romer, who chaired the Council of Economic Advisers during Obama’s first presidential term, have worked closely with Obama in the past.
Summers’s opponents, who spanned both sides of the aisle but mostly included Democrats, criticized his ties to Wall Street and claimed that he had contributed to the financial crisis by easing banking regulation as Secretary of the Treasury—a post he occupied before taking office in Massachusetts Hall from 2001 to 2006.
Still, Summers had garnered some prominent supporters in the academic and business fields, including financier Steven L. Rattner. In a Politico op-ed earlier this month, Sue J. Goldie, a professor at Harvard School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School, contested claims that Summers treated women with whom he worked poorly, describing him instead as “encouraging, promoting, and investing in women like me.”

This week, the Admissions Blog conducted an interview with Anna Ivey, the founder of the college admissions consulting firm Ivey Consulting and co-author of the book, “How to Prepare a Standout College Application: Expert Advice that Takes You from LMO* (*Like Many Others) to Admit.”
Admissions Blog: Why do most early action and early decision students decide to apply to college early?
Anna Ivey: In my experience, the students who are best suited for early action or early decision, are [the] ones who have very good track records from their previous years in high school. So their academics are in really good shape, their extracurriculars are in really good shape, and they’re not so dependent on their senior year in high school to kind of move their track record in a different direction. So for example, someone who still needs to work on academics or getting some of their test scores, or accomplish a bit more in the extracurricular world outside the classroom—that person might benefit from applying later in the cycle in the regular pool because then you have more of a track record you can present yourself with.
AB: When do you think it is advantageous for a student to apply to a college early?
AI: One of the things [admissions officers] have to care about, both in terms of their job and in terms of their rankings, is called “yield”. And yield is basically the amount of people who accept a school’s offer. You as the applicant take that concern off the table by committing yourself, Because if you get admitted there you will go, and so they have no yield concern over you. But really the action programs that aren’t binding in any way or that are not single choice—they don’t really have any implication one way or the other for yield.
AB: What are the disadvantages?
AI: If you commit yourself to a binding early decision program you are forgoing opportunities to apply elsewhere and that might matter not so much on the admissions side—maybe that is your true first choice, and you get in and that’s fantastic—but you might be trading off an opportunity to see what other financial aid offers you might be able to receive.
AB: What timeline should students who are applying early follow?
AI: The early deadlines tend to be in November—sometimes schools have multiple rounds of early [admission] but the first ones tend to be in November. And it’s always very important to look up and confirm what those deadlines are for any one of your schools and make sure those are calendared appropriately and you keep track of them. And they you really want to work backwards from there. Ideally you don’t want to wait until the fall of your senior year to go looking for colleges. I think if you can start your college touring and your college research before the summer of your senior year, then you’re going to be in the best shape to make the decision of whether to apply early.
AB: What does it mean when you get deferred?
AI: Being deferred into the regular pool from the early pool is not a terrible outcome. It does not mean that you don’t have a shot, it’s not a courtesy deferral to spare your feelings and in fact if you even look at Harvard’s statistics from the class of 2016, they deferred nearly two thirds of the early applicants. If you get deferred from the early pool to the regular pool, treat that as an opportunity, not as a liability.
