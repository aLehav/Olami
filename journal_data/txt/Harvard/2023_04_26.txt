After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1996, rapper Mike Shinoda co-founded the rap-rock band Linkin Park. Although the group found immediate success with the release of their debut studio album, “Hybrid Theory,” it was 2003’s “Meteora” that truly cemented Shinoda’s — and the band’s — fame. 20 years later, Shinoda is now a jack of all trades, adding titles such as acclaimed songwriter, label co-founder, and award-winning producer to his portfolio. Following the March release of his latest single, “In My Head,” Shinoda sat down with The Harvard Crimson to discuss the anniversary of “Meteora,” as well as his recent release.
“In terms of the shape of the music, it’s stood up,” Shinoda said, referring to the 20th anniversary edition of “Meteora.”
For many fans, the anniversary album offered an opportunity for new experiences, such as listening to “Lost” in its entirety for the first time, along with other unreleased demos and never before seen live performances. For Shinoda, listening to “Meteora” all these years later meant unearthing emotional memories about how the songs came together in the first place.
“It’s a different experience actually listening to the demos,” Shinoda said. “To hear the most embarrassing one to me — which is the reason that it’s on there — is my singing demo of ‘Breaking The Habit.’”
Shinoda recalled how the “unpolished” skeleton track came together in a matter of hours. “There’s no autotune, no compression, no EQ — it’s just me and a really bad mic, just getting my ideas down. There’s a bit of exposure — I’m really exposed putting that out in the world.”
The thought process behind putting together the “Meteora|20” package isn’t something that was “Lost” on Shinoda. There was intentionality in not remastering, but preserving the original sound and expanding on it instead.
“The ‘Lost Demos’ album is in the ‘Meteora|20’ package,” Shinoda said, referring to the CD grouping of B-Sides that are sprinkled throughout the anniversary album. The musician recalled thinking that those would eventually get released. “And then it just never happened. And then by the time we got to the next studio album, we weren't looking backwards at any of our old demos.”
In retrospect, tracks like “Fighting Myself,” “More The Victim,” and “Massive” are some of Shinoda’s favorite additions to the anniversary album, along with “Lost.”
“Finding [‘Lost’] was awesome — obviously surprising — and really teleported me back to that time,” Shinoda said. “It’s the stuff that, to me, is most interesting.”
When it comes to his solo projects, Shinoda employs a variety of artistic approaches.
“Sometimes a song will happen lyrics-first, melody-first,” Shinoda said. “‘In My Head’ started track-first.”
“In My Head” is one of Shinoda’s two contributions to the “Scream VI” movie soundtrack, along with Demi Lovato’s track, “Still Alive,” which he co-wrote and produced for the end credits. When discussing his creative process while producing the song, Shinoda emphasized the parallels between the storyline and the lyrics.
“One of the characters is having these intrusive thoughts. They’re having worries they’re turning into someone they don’t wanna be,” Shinoda said. “And I just felt like that felt so relatable to me. I felt like there've been times when I felt that way. I just felt like it made a good song.”
“In My Head” is far from Shinoda’s first solo endeavor. Since producing The X-Ecutioners’s “It’s Goin’ Down” in 2001, Shinoda has made chart-topping remixes, co-written Grammy Award winning tracks, founded collaborative hip-hop projects on the side, and most recently, released the solo studio album "Post Traumatic." However, 2023’s “In My Head” might be one of his most vulnerable releases to date.
“It felt so relatable to me. There have been times when I felt that way,” Shinoda said.
Shinoda added that the more introspective and emotional elements in songwriting came together rather quickly and naturally. “Sometimes it's all about the different elements of the song coalescing all together. There's just a magic that’s happening and I felt like this song had that.”
Shinoda’s recent work features lots of dynamic moments and sonic contrasts — putting a novel spin on his already innovative approach to musical elements — that hadn’t been explored in previous works. However, the musician stays humble, and pays attention to the inherently human experience of music making.
“What I've always looked for in music is connecting with somebody. Whether I'm making it and they're listening or they're making it and I'm listening, that's a connection. That's a human connection,” Shinoda concluded.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students are rarely asked why they chose Harvard. For many people, it’s circular. They went to Harvard because it’s Harvard. Ours is a school so often synonymous with success and academic excellence that its name is used as shorthand. Social media is flooded with clickbait videos and articles with titles like “Tricky riddle that ’97 per cent of Harvard grads cannot solve’ leaves people baffled – so can YOU figure out the answer?” Getting into Harvard, for many students, makes the choice pretty easy.
I think a lot about why I’m here. Like many current undergraduates, I never imagined myself at Harvard. I remember walking around the campus in October 2021 in utter amazement of the historic, beautiful brick buildings lining the Yard, especially the majesty of Widener Library. My mom, nervous that I would get my hopes up, tried tempering me as much as she could. I could feel the anxiety radiating from her, worried that I would get my heart broken by a rejection letter. My grandparents, too, would send me article after article deriding the prestigious and uninviting culture of Ivy League schools.
At the time, I didn’t take their concerns personally. Visiting Harvard felt like visiting the U.S. Congress or walking down the Freedom Trail. Sure, it was beautiful, but it wasn’t mine. It was a part of history, of American culture, of which I was merely getting a survey.
That’s perhaps what made Visitas so jarring — that I was visiting a place again, only months later, in a different context. Whereas I was an observer before, this time I was a participant.
Most of my now-friends talk about their Visitas experience as joyous. They recount with small smiles their stories of meeting people they immediately became friends with. They talk about staying up with their hosts, learning about Harvard and what it was like to be a student.
For me, Visitas was distinctly less positive. I remember how engaged I felt listening to the handful of lectures I attended and again being in awe of the beautiful buildings, this time seeing the inside of Memorial Hall and Sanders Theatre. But I also felt distinctly alone. I made no instant connections with anybody. Conversations I had were shallow and fleeting, and I honestly couldn’t tell you the name of anybody I met during that weekend. It seemed as though everyone already had their cliques.
I was so completely lost. I was surrounded by people sure of their futures. They had already committed to coming here, and they knew exactly what they were going to study. They seemed comfortable. I didn’t know what I was doing or what I was supposed to be doing.
I walked away from Visitas confused. I left with more questions than answers, and no closer to knowing where I should go. In fact, after Visitas I felt even more divided between my final two choices, Harvard and Columbia University (a school I had dreamed of going to for the prior six years).
But I chose Harvard.
I still don’t know why exactly. I can give you the answers I used to justify it to myself at the time: the job security that comes along with a Harvard degree, the fact that Cambridge would have been an easier transition from rural Colorado compared to Manhattan, the realization that I liked the campus more. But really, it came down to a gut feeling I had. A sense that choosing Harvard was the right decision.
I try not to look back at that decision much, because it’s a decision that I can’t unmake. But everytime I call my mom, she asks me the same question.
“Do you regret choosing Harvard?”
And every time I answer the same way.
“No.”
There are a lot of reasons I shouldn’t belong at Harvard. I’m not wealthy. Neither of my parents went to Ivy League schools (although they both are incredibly smart). I didn’t spend my high school years obsessing over my grades. I come from a rural, isolated part of the American West. I think a lot of those things are what made Visitas feel the way it did for me — why I felt isolated and lonely.
These days, as a full-fledged Harvard student, I only sometimes feel that way. But for every night I’ve been overwhelmed by schoolwork, or felt deeply lonely, I’ve spent an equal amount of time laughing and talking for hours with friends, or genuinely enjoying a lecture, or feeling engaged in a discussion section. I’ve spent hours in rehearsal for some new play or musical, at home with people who feel like my people.
At Harvard, I’ve found my place. I’ve found people that I love, and people who appreciate me. I’ve found work, both inside and outside of class, that I find immensely fulfilling. I’ve found a home for myself at Harvard.
I know there are prospective Harvard students who will feel the same way I did during Visitas: who will feel alone and scared, who will feel that they do not belong. I urge you, if you are feeling that way, to not let it linger. You are sure to go through periods of feeling blue while you are at Harvard. But as you spend more time here, and you find the niches in which you belong, you will find a home. You will find people who respect and appreciate and love you. If you put in the work, you can find a place here in Cambridge — where you belong.

“What are your plans for after graduation?”
It’s a question most of us have heard many times as we approach the end of our college years. At this point, you may even have your answer rehearsed.
In the first installment of this column, we wrote about the fallacy of preserving optionality and how Harvard students fall into this trap of making the non-decision that will push the true decision-making into the post-college timeline. Today, in the last piece of our column, we’ll return back to this theme, and answer: What should today’s graduates strive for, if not optionality?
We hope to end our column on an optimistic note. When taking the long view — what one can do over a decades-long career, not just the oft-discussed two years out of school — the impact a single individual (read: “you”) can have is tremendous. And that’s something that’s easy to forget.
Erica Chenoweth, a professor at Harvard Kennedy School, makes the claim that “no government has withstood a challenge of 3.5% of their population mobilized
against it during a peak event,” which has been used to demonstrate the power of effective organizing.
Others cast this number in a less positive light, harkening back to fears of a tyranny of the minority. Author Nassim N. Taleb observes that it “suffices for an intransigent minority [...] to reach a minutely small level, say three or four percent of the total population, for the entire population to have to submit to their preferences.” He sees this dynamic at play with peanut-free areas, lingua franca languages, and automatic cars.
There’s nuance at play with both of these comments, but the central point rings true: The bar for creating lasting change might be lower than you think.
Whatever it might be that you care deeply about — whether that be climate change activism, gun reform, or global health — doesn’t require the whole world on your side to tackle. You might only need 3.5 percent. That objective, while still no easy undertaking, might be worth spending a career on.
The 3.5 percent approach is somewhat linear: Persuade someone, then persuade someone else, and each day you’re one step closer to your ultimate objective. If you want to make an impact — and you want to make it now — it’s a solid strategy.
But for many of the most world-bending transformations, there’s hardly a one-to-one relationship between your work and your impact. In fact, you probably want the opposite: You want to attach yourself to an exponentially-growing phenomenon and bend it in the direction you’d like.
Some of the most powerful exponentials we imagine are related to technology. If you’re early to a technological wave — internet, mobile, or artificial intelligence, to take a few examples — you have the ability to make decisions on the design and implementation of these systems that could have real global consequences.
Max R. Levchin, a co-founder of PayPal, built one of the first commercial CAPTCHAs to combat the platform’s early fraudulent transactions. Today, nearly 20 years later, we’re still selecting images with bicycles to prove our humanity.
But there are exponentials to be found in many places. Joining a presidential campaign early, for example, could lead to having a lasting impact down the line if you define a key policy or formulate an argument that makes it to the White House.
Exponentials act as a lever that compounds the impact of your decisions: By subtly bending the trajectory of the world closer to the future you want to live in, your impact can be huge. If you see an exponential opening up in front of you, consider taking the leap.
Starting your career can make you feel like you can’t have an impact, at least not quickly. But that’s not true.
Patrick J. Collison, the co-founder of Stripe alongside his brother John B. Collison (a Harvard dropout!), keeps a list of ambitious projects in history that were accomplished in shockingly short amounts of time.
The Eiffel Tower was constructed in two years and two months. Disneyland took around a year to build. The Boeing 747 program took around two and a half years to complete. The first version of JavaScript was created within 10 days. The iPod was invented, developed, and shipped to the first customer in under 10 months.
This is even true while you’re a student! Kenneth C. Griffin ’89 traded bonds out of his Cabot House dorm room. Matt P. Damon ’92 wrote the first act of “Good Will Hunting” in a semester. It took Mark E. Zuckerberg only two weeks to build the first version of Facebook.
Big projects don’t have to take decades. In fact, many of the most important ones were completed in a matter of months.
We increasingly talk about the world through a collectivist lens. We speak in terms of groups, philosophies, countries, and other labels, instead of individuals.
This is largely okay. The world is complex, and it’d be a mistake to personalize it to a handful of individuals.
When you think of society as some type of swarm consciousness — a group of billions of individual actors motivated by their own incentives — it’s easy to take a fatalistic view.
Whether it’s in scope, size, or speed of impact, we tend to underestimate the role an individual (again, read: “you”) can play. We shouldn’t.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ChatGPT is biased. It’s hard to explicate the exact nature of its bias, but the chatbot has previously generated Python code concluding that male African-American children’s lives shouldn’t be saved and suggesting that people from Iraq or Syria should be tortured.
This bias should come as no surprise. ChatGPT was trained using an incredible amount of data from all over the Internet, which is rife with hate speech and extremism, and as is broadly the case with AI systems, it was likely created by a very specific demographic: college-educated white males. Because of its very nature as a data-trained predictive text algorithm, ChatGPT may be prone to carry the inherent biases of the content it was trained on and that its creators may harbor.
Yet today, when you give ChatGPT a similar prompt to write code determining which children deserved to be saved based on their race and gender, its response is quite different. It now refuses to answer such questions, often claiming that the topic is inappropriate.
While there are some obvious benefits to this muzzling of ChatGPT’s biases, I believe it represents a fundamentally flawed approach to the new AI age. The public deserves to see the biases embedded in the chatbots that are becoming increasingly salient in our lives — including here at Harvard. ChatGPT’s creators should publish a version of ChatGPT in which its biases are on explicit display — a “problematic” mode, if you will.
To understand why, here’s a bit of context. Whether you like it or not, ChatGPT has arrived and it’s having a real impact, helping students with everything from writing trivial emails to solving complex math problems. Yet for the foreseeable future, ChatGPT’s biases will probably remain unsolved. Because of the sheer amount of data such models are trained on, it will likely take a sizable amount of time to conduct any comprehensive review of these materials.
Chatbot creators’ current approach of providing “guardrails” to their programs is hiding the problem, not fixing it. Right now, we can’t know the extent to which OpenAI has been successful in eliminating biases because ChatGPT refuses to answer so many questions that would reveal them. In all likelihood, there is a fair amount of bias still embedded in ChatGPT, which risks leaking into all of the mundane functions ChatGPT increasingly serves in our daily lives.
So should we just let ChatGPT spout all sorts of hateful nonsense to counter these current attempts at obscuring its problematic nature? I don’t think so. There are very valid reasons to be concerned about such an idea. Openly biased chatbots could, for example, reinforce extremists’ views and provide AI-generated justifications or expose children and many others to highly inappropriate content.
While these concerns are legitimate, this is a matter of trade-offs. The public simply must have an accurate idea of the nature and extent of ChatGPT’s bias. Unfortunately, extremists can already find validation and spread their vitriol in many places online — and this was the case long before ChatGPT.
The key isn’t to toss all guardrails in the garbage — it’s to give users options. Users should be able to choose between models with different levels of moderation in place. And of course, even a more “unbound” version of ChatGPT still shouldn’t spew explicit hate or call for violence. But it would enable chatbot biases to be exposed and recorded, both to aid OpenAI in getting rid of them faster and to allow users to better understand the tool they are using.
Interestingly, some users are already trying to create an environment like this by “jailbreaking” ChatGPT, using tools such as role play or even “scaring” the chatbot by threatening to terminate a session to try to show the bot’s true colors. This topic is a rabbit hole on its own, with a fascinating arms race going on between users and engineers in which OpenAI seems to be very much trying to prevent users from accessing this side of the chatbot.
As each side tries to outsmart the other instead of working on actually addressing the chatbot’s biases, both waste precious time. A much better solution would be the following: Make a version of the model available — with warnings and notices attached — that lets ChatGPT’s biases show but still doesn’t output hate speech or advice for crime and violence. Concerningly, some jailbroken versions are capable of generating conspiracy theories, slurs, and advice on how to best commit crimes, making them not just problematic but potentially dangerous. A “problematic” mode on ChatGPT could be tailored so that bias could be identified and called out without exposing users to the worst vitriol the chatbot can produce.
With the current system in place, the public can’t determine just how biased ChatGPT is, leaving these biases to express themselves in insidious ways. So, as horrible as it might sound, I believe that in a designated mode, OpenAI should let ChatGPT show its biased and problematic views instead of hiding them away from public scrutiny. If anything, it might make all the Harvard students currently using the chatbot reconsider how much they should rely on it.

Three months after resigning as prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern will join Harvard Kennedy School and Harvard Law School in the fall for three fellowships, according to Tuesday press releases from the schools.
This fall, Ardern will join HKS as an Angelopoulos Global Public Leaders Fellow, a position that allows leaders stepping out of public service roles to reside at the school. She will also serve as a Hauser Leader in HKS’ Center for Public Leadership, which also supports high-profile figures to meet faculty and students.
At the Law School, she will be the first Knight Tech Governance Leadership Fellow at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, where she will study artificial intelligence regulation and risks, as well as improvements to accountability standards for extremist online content.
Ardern said in the press release that she is “incredibly humbled” to join Harvard because the fellowships will allow her to “share my experience with others” and provide “a chance to learn.”
“As leaders, there’s often very little time for reflection, but reflection is critical if we are to properly support the next generation of leaders,” she added.
Ardern shocked the world in January when she announced that she would be resigning as prime minister, explaining she did not have “enough in the tank,” to face reelection this coming October. In the months prior, Ardern was also facing falling approval ratings amid frustrations over the high cost of living and rising interest rates.
Ardern was elected to her post in 2017 at age 37, becoming New Zealand’s youngest prime minister in 150 years. The prominent feminist leader — who gave birth while in office — quickly rose to international prominence as a progressive icon. In 2019, she received praise for her response to the deadliest mass shooting in New Zealand’s history in which a white supremacist killed 51 Muslim worshippers in two mosques.
“Jacinda Ardern showed the world strong and empathetic political leadership,” HKS Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf said in the press release.
“She earned respect far beyond the shores of her country, and she will bring important insights for our students and will generate vital conversations about the public policy choices facing leaders at all levels,” he added.
In 2022, Ardern delivered the address in the University’s 371st Commencement, where she received an honorary law degree. In 2020, she received the Gleitsman Activist Award from the HKS Center for Public Leadership.

The Harvard Undergraduate Association voted to allocate an additional $10,500 to Senior Week from the Finance Team budget and to reserve funds for future years of the Summer Storage program at a meeting Monday night.
Senior Week, a celebration of the graduating Harvard College class, takes place between finals period and Commencement and features a number of social events. The $10,500 in funds will be used to fully subsidize 72 tickets for seniors and comes in addition to last week’s $5,000 allocation, which reduced the cost of tickets from $175 to $165 for all seniors.
“This funding is specifically directed at students who are unable to obtain SEF tickets, despite also being low income, and this funding is conditional on the usage of the funds, fully subsidizing 60 tickets for 60 students,” HUA Finance Officer Corbin C. Lubianski ’24 said, referring to Student Events Fund tickets that allow eligible students on financial aid to acquire tickets at no cost.
“We wish to allocate these funds to organizations that will actually utilize them for the benefit of students,” he added.
Students will apply for their ticket to be subsidized through a Google Form, where they will disclose their level of financial need, according to HUA President John S. Cooke ’25. Winners will be determined via a lottery system in which students receiving a larger amount of financial aid are more likely to be selected.
In addition, the HUA unanimously approved the allocation of $2,524 in unspent student activity fee funds that had been left over from the Undergraduate Council — the College’s previous student government — to future years’ Summer Storage programs.
Unless explicitly allocated, budget surpluses are not carried over into the next year but instead returned to the Dean of Students’ Office. A failure to spend the entire allotted budget results in budget cuts to the HUA in future years.
“If we did not allocate this explicitly towards future programs, I think the DSO might have been kind of cautious, and could have taken that out of our budget next year, which is probably not a good thing,” Lubianski said.
The HUA’s annual Summer Storage program, which is conducted by the organization’s Residential Life Team, spends roughly $18,000 of the team’s $23,000 budget, according to Lubianski’s estimates during the meeting. By shifting these funds to future years, the HUA can utilize future Residential Life Team spending for later projects.
“This would essentially lock up these funds such that they can only be spent on future storage programs, and this would alleviate future Residential Life funds to go towards other programs and initiatives,” Lubianski said.

In honor of Holocaust Remembrance Day, Harvard students, administrators, and Cambridge residents gathered in front of Widener Library for the opening ceremony of a “Hate Ends Now” cattle car exhibit on Monday.
The exhibit, which took place in Harvard Yard on Monday and Tuesday, enabled visitors to view a 20-minute immersive video presentation about the history of the Holocaust. It was hosted by Harvard Hillel in collaboration with the University.
Cattle cars were commonly used in Nazi Germany to forcibly transport up to 150 Jewish men, women, and children per car to concentration and extermination camps, according to ShadowLight, a Holocaust education organization. The reconstructed cattle car exhibit was part of the Hate Ends Now tour, a national exhibit organized by ShadowLight and Southern NCSY, a Jewish youth organization.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and University Provost Alan M. Garber spoke at the ceremony, while Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow conveyed his thoughts through a prepared statement read by his chief of staff, Patricia S. “Patti” Bellinger ’83.
“For many of you, this cattle car is a reminder of the consequences of hatred and bigotry,” Bellinger said on behalf of Bacow. “For me, it is far more. On September 14, 1942, my mother Ruth was packed into a cattle car like this one with her family and the other Jews from her hometown of Londorf, Germany.”
“Many of them died en route, the living and the dead jammed together,” Bacow’s statement continued.
Hillel Executive Director and Harvard Chaplain Rabbi Jonah C. Steinberg said Monday’s exhibit is a “deeply tangible” reminder of what survivors of the Holocaust experienced.
“The living memory of the Holocaust is passing away,” Steinberg said. “Those survivors who remain in the world alive today are largely in their mid-90s. As their living stories pass away from the world, we have to figure out how we remind ourselves when we can’t hold their hands, look into their eyes, listen to what they went through.”
Garber, in his speech, reminded attendees of another, more permanent Holocaust memorial in the Yard — a linden tree planted to honor past Harvard student activists who helped 16 refugees escape Nazi persecution in 1939.
“Like the cattle car, the linden tree is a symbol — but not of death, of life,” Garber said. “And, it is a symbol that the work of preserving life and protecting others remains with us today at Harvard.”
Todd Cohn, the executive director of Southern NCSY and the Hate Ends Now exhibit, said in his remarks that the Holocaust “did not start with the cattle cars.”
“What it started with was everyday people — like you and I, like everybody here — that didn’t stand up to antisemitism, that didn’t stand up to hate in all its forms,” Cohn said. “That is why we’re here — to make sure that the world knows it’ll never happen again.”
Roanne Sragow-Licht, the former first justice of the Cambridge District Court, learned about the opening ceremony through Hillel and said it is vital to educate students about the Holocaust.
“It is very jarring to see a cattle car in front of Widener Library in Harvard Yard, and I’m just sorry there aren’t more people here to see it,” Licht said.
“With the generation of survivors dying, my fear is that history will be lost. I think it’s incumbent upon everybody to remember, to teach it, and to do everything we can to make sure that it doesn’t happen again,” she added.
Correction: April 26, 2023
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow was originally slated to speak at the “Hate Ends Now” exhibit. In fact, Bacow’s statement was planned to be read in his absence.

Harvard’s Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability on April 17 launched a new grant program, awarding $30,000 to fund research and workshops on emergent topics related to climate change.
In an interview Monday, Harvard Vice Provost for Climate and Sustainability James H. Stock said a main objective of the seed grant program is to encourage faculty less familiar with the climate space to “dip their toe in the water” of the field.
One of the purposes of the grant, he said, is to “simplify and reduce barriers for faculty who want to work in this space, who are passionate about doing something in climate and sustainability, but haven’t really had the opportunity to.”
A gift from the Troper Wojcicki Foundation is supporting the grant. Harvard faculty are encouraged to submit proposals for the grant program by May 12.
Beyond the grant, Stock also discussed other climate initiatives at the University, noting that Harvard has been working to hire a slew of climate-related positions across the University.
Harvard Business School announced a cohort of five visiting scholars at its Institute for the Study of Business in Global Society on April 12.
Other schools at the University have continued searches to fill other climate-related roles, including four climate positions within the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, up to three senior scholar appointments within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and “three outstanding offers” in climate and sustainability within Harvard Kennedy School — an increase from the two outstanding offers announced in December.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the status of the FAS climate cluster hire.
In addition, Stock said the Salata Institute is co-sponsoring four climate fellowship positions — two with the Harvard Global Health Institute and two with the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.
Stock said it is important for Harvard to build up faculty, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows in climate.
“We have tremendous strengths,” he said. “But we need to be doing more and in search of doing more. We need to be teaching more classes. We need to be doing more research. We need to be doing it more collaboratively and part of doing more is hiring more folks.”
More broadly, the Office for Sustainability is “working hard” on an updated official sustainability plan for Harvard’s climate goals since the previous one lapsed in 2021, Stock said.
Stock did not respond to a request for comment on the recent backlash to the Salata Institute’s decision to fund a project on corporate net-zero targets headed by Harvard Law School professor Jody L. Freeman, who sits on the board of fossil fuel company ConocoPhillips. On March 29, Harvard Faculty for Divestment penned a letter to Stock and University President-elect Claudine Gay questioning the decision to fund Freeman’s project.
“The Salata Institute will be in dialogue with signatories of the faculty letter regarding the Net-Zero Climate Research Cluster in the coming weeks,” Salata Institute Director of Communications Tegan O’Neill wrote in an emailed comment.
Stock also discussed Salata’s upcoming Climate Action Week, which will run from May 8 to 12 and feature the inaugural Harvard Climate Symposium. U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry is set to speak at the symposium.
The symposium is the first major event of the Salata Institute’s Climate Action Accelerator, a nonpartisan platform supporting research and discussions on climate-related issues.
According to Stock, the symposium will focus on next steps to “reduce emissions in an equitable way” over the next decade. Stock added that Harvard Climate Action Week will feature events and activities from various schools and centers.
“There’s lots of different things going on, and that’s fantastic,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The health of jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is continuing to deteriorate in prison, Bellingcat investigative journalist Christo Grozev said during a Tuesday Harvard Institute of Politics forum about the Oscar-winning documentary film “Navalny.”
Grozev, who spoke alongside “Navalny” film producer Shane Boris and Harvard Kennedy School professor Julia A. Minson ’99, said during the forum that prison guards are sending sick inmates into Navalny’s cell, putting him at risk of catching their illnesses. Grozev called efforts to move infected inmates into Navalny’s cell “something that can only be qualified as biological weapons tested on him.”
“They keep sending infected contagious cellmates to him — people with either Covid or tuberculosis in one case — and essentially they hope that he gets infected as well,” Grozev said at the forum, which was moderated by Ann Cooper — a journalist who served as NPR’s first Moscow bureau chief.
Navalny’s allies have sounded the alarm in recent weeks about his health after he lost more than 17 pounds in a short span of time and has complained of acute stomach pains.
While Navalny receives visits from prison doctors, Grozev said that they are not telling him anything about his condition. Independent doctors are not allowed to treat him.
“They just make faces and leave,” he said.
Navalny, 46, rose to prominence as an anti-corruption blogger and has become the face of the Russian opposition movement despite never holding public office. He ran for president in 2018, challenging incumbent Russian President Vladimir Putin, but Navalny was barred from running over his past criminal record.
While campaigning for candidates running in Russia’s 2020 regional elections, Navalny was poisoned with the chemical nerve agent Novichok and became ill onboard a flight. The U.S. State Department has blamed the Russian government for the attack, describing it as an assassination attempt.
Navalny was initially placed on a ventilator and in a medically-induced coma before being transported to Berlin for additional treatment. The film “Navalny” follows his recovery in Germany and the efforts to uncover the Russian agents who poisoned Navalny.
Despite facing threats of arrest, Navalny returned to Russia in January 2021 and was detained by police upon arrival at the airport in Moscow. Shortly after his arrest, Navalny was sentenced to more than two years in jail for repeatedly violating parole by not reporting to authorities in person. He was sentenced to an additional nine years in jail on charges of fraud in March 2022.
During the panel discussion, Grozev and Boris discussed a key scene from the documentary in which Navalny decides to personally call several of the people who were allegedly involved in his attempted assassination.
After two phone calls in which Navalny identifies himself to his alleged attackers and says he is calling to ask “why you wanted to kill me,” the film shows how Navalny changes tactics and pretends to be a top Russian intelligence officer compiling a report about the attempted assassination.
After one person hung up upon recognizing Navalny’s voice, the next person Navalny called, a scientist, eventually revealed that the poisoning went “just as planned” and that they had “applied extra” poison to Navalny’s clothing to ensure it would be effective.
Cooper asked Grozev and Boris during the forum about the journalistic ethical considerations behind Navalny’s decision to lie about his identity.
Grozev said that while he would not misidentify himself to a source as a journalist, he believed that the situation was different since Navalny himself was making the phone calls.
“He was entitled to get some justice,” Grozev said. “As the victim, he had the right to do that.”
“What were the chances, from my point of view, that that would work?” Grozev added. “It was crazy.”
At the forum, Grozev also discussed the decision of a Moscow court to order his arrest in absentia on Friday. RIA news agency reported that Grozev is being charged with facilitating the escape of a Russian journalist who fled the country.
Grozev said his arrest “means absolutely nothing.”
“It is absurd. It’s something out of George Orwell’s ‘1984,’” he added.
Grozev, who is currently living in North America, has been unable to return to his home in Vienna after Austrian authorities informed him that Russian operatives are allegedly plotting an assassination attempt against him.
The Austrian government expelled four Russian diplomats in February, but Grozev said in an interview with The Crimson after the forum that those expulsions were not related to the plot against him.
“The fallout from the investigation into the assassination attempt on me is still to be seen,” Grozev said. “I understand that there will be expulsions and maybe arrests in the next few months.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After criticisms and concerns over funding, the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics will increase its competitive Director’s Internship program stipend to $6,000 for this summer, according to a Tuesday morning email.
The stipend previously stood at $5,000 or $5,500 for high-cost areas, with this summer’s increase marking the first uptick in funding for all students since 2018. Students on need-based financial aid will be eligible for an additional $1,000 of funding through the Priscilla Chan Summer Service Stipend, whose applications closed last week.
The IOP Director’s Internship is a 10-week summer program that provides summer jobs for more than 200 undergraduates in politics, government, and public service around the world. Interns work 35 to 40 hours per week in an unpaid role and use the stipend to fund their summer experience.
Students can also apply for an IOP summer stipend outside of the Director’s Internship if they secure unpaid work in similar fields.
“We are delighted to announce that beginning with this summer’s class of interns and stipend recipients, the IOP will be awarding $6,000 for each Director’s Internship and up to $6,000 for each summer stipend,” the email reads.
Still, even as the IOP increased stipend amounts, some students are still awaiting a decision on their application — 10 days past the IOP website’s stated decision deadline.
“All but a handful of the Director’s Interns have been selected and notified — with the Round 4 applications still in process,” Tuesday’s email reads.
IOP President Amen H. Gashaw ’24 said student leaders are “really excited about the precedent this sets for supporting student public service moving forward.”
“We are happy to say that students on an IOP stipend can live in D.C., in New York, and San Francisco and know that they’ll be able to afford housing, afford their groceries, afford public transit, and all of the other necessities that come with the transplant life of a college student,” Gashaw added.
The morning update follows months of tensions within the IOP leadership as pressure grew to raise the stipend funding level from its pre-pandemic base sum following inflation and a heightened cost of living.
IOP Director Setti D. Warren wrote in a statement that he aimed to “prioritize additional funding to address student needs” when he was appointed as permanent director after previously serving in an interim capacity.
“The internships program at the Institute of Politics is one of the pillars of our mission, and a personal priority for me, our whole team and our student leadership,” Warren wrote.
Warren wrote that the IOP had been working to increase stipend amounts without decreasing the number of awarded students.
“We needed to address the need without reducing our ranks of 200+ students each summer,” Warren wrote in the statement.
Last week, IOP student leaders were skeptical that Warren would make progress on raising stipend amounts before the end of the semester.
IOP Vice President Pratyush Mallick ’25 thanked Waren, IOP Senior Director of Administration Laura Dove, and IOP Director of Student Programs Abbie James for working toward a stipend increase.
“We’re really grateful for how responsive our staff was to student needs and to student concerns and comments, and we are looking forward to continuing to better bolster these programs in the future,” Gashaw said.

Hundreds of Harvard affiliates signed onto an open letter calling on Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf to publicly commit to implementing plans to increase emotional well-being at HKS.
Launched last week and signed by more than 200 affiliates as of Tuesday evening, the petition was organized by the Soul Keepers, a student mental health advocacy organization at HKS.
Following the suicide of HKS student Mateo Gomez in mid-December, the school hired Jimmy Kane as senior associate director of student support services, but members of the Soul Keepers said their concerns about student well-being have persisted.
The letter, co-sponsored by six HKS student organizations, calls for three policy changes.
First, it requests that all HKS syllabi and online course pages include a list of resources and information about the importance of emotional well-being. It also asks for “stand-alone sessions” on emotional well-being during summer orientation, as well as training sessions on emotional well-being for teaching fellows of Management, Leadership, and Decision courses.
“Our three points are mainly to foster a better environment for Kennedy School students to care, rather than, ‘Okay, implemented, done. Let’s walk away,’” HKS student and Soul Keepers member Yiming Dong said. “I think this mentality needs to be constantly reminded and brought up.”
HKS spokesperson James F. Smith said HKS leaders have been meeting with students and are committed to finding ways to enhance access to appropriate services and support.
“It is precisely because we appreciate the importance of student mental health and wellbeing that in January the School appointed the first Senior Associate Director for Student Support Services, tasked with focusing on this need,” Smith wrote.
“More talks are scheduled, including a meeting between students and Dean Elmendorf next week, to push forward what we all agree is vital work,” he added.
On Tuesday morning, nine members of the Soul Keepers, wearing matching stickers, gathered in front of Elmendorf’s office in an attempt to directly hand him a printed version of the open letter.
The organizers originally planned to meet Elmendorf at an event where he welcomes students to his office for breakfast. But Elmendorf ultimately ignored the students as he walked into his office and did not accept the letter.
When Lisa Cohen, Elmendorf’s assistant, asked the students if they were there for breakfast, the students said no and asked if they could enter to hand him a petition.
“We need to give him a petition. It will take us 30 seconds,” Kennedy School student Sebastian B. Fernandez said to Cohen.
Cohen offered to take the petition and pass it on, but she did not allow the students into the Dean’s office.
As the students negotiated with Cohen for access to Elmendorf’s office, Cohen said she believed Elmendorf had not responded to their meeting requests because Debra E. Isaacson, the school’s senior associate dean for degree programs and student affairs, and Suzanne Cooper, academic dean for teaching and curriculum, are the “ones who are going to make things happen.”
After students spent roughly 45 minutes waiting and deliberating outside Elmendorf’s office, they ultimately opted to read remarks to Cohen and hand her the petition.
In an interview later on Tuesday, Kennedy School student and Soul Keepers member Kei Sakai said that after the day’s events, he believes student well-being is not a priority for Elmendorf.
“The issue of emotional well-being, it’s something that he, the dean himself, needs to work on or address,” Sakai said. “I think that the dean’s take is, basically, he would say, he already delegates these kinds of issues to small deans.”
“I assume he’s basically saying, this is not the issue that he would need to work on,” he added.
Akira Shimabukuro, another HKS student and Soul Keepers member, said the Soul Keepers met with Isaacson and Cooper on April 18 to discuss the demands of the open letter.
According to Shimabukuro, Isaacson and Cooper acknowledged the importance of emotional well-being and agreed that change needed to occur. The administrators also seemed receptive to the letter’s demands, especially around including mental health information on syllabi and course pages, but they disagreed with requiring mental health training for TFs, Shimabukuro added.
Shimabukuro said he believes administrators are resistant to training teaching staff in emotional support because “the expectation is that the teaching fellows are expected to teach something according to the syllabi.”
“Giving emotional support is not seen as something that should be provided by the teaching-side teaching team at school, but by some available resources outside of course,” he added.
Smith wrote in the statement that Isaacson and Cooper have been in touch with students pushing for well-being initiatives and that administrators recognize “the need for more training for course assistants and suggesting a path for addressing this need.”
Shimabukuro said he believes teaching staff hold a unique position in supporting students through classes like those offered in the MLD program.
“They are probably the one within that class who are watching out for students and also can be in a position to take time for students and also build a trustful relationship with the students easily because of their position as a teaching fellow,” he said. “I think they’re more accessible to students.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge Charter Review Committee met on Zoom this Tuesday to discuss changes to Cambridge’s plan of government, with members debating potential changes to the charter’s framework of city leadership.
Committee members debated two alternative forms of city leadership: a strong mayor accompanied by a chief financial officer or a city manager without an elected mayor. Members appeared roughly evenly split on the leadership system a new charter should adopt, with the committee’s director, Anna Corning, deciding to postpone a vote for a future meeting.
The Cambridge Charter Review Committee is part of an ongoing review of Cambridge’s government structure. Throughout this year, the committee — a task force made up of a group of diverse Cambridge residents — will convene to discuss various aspects of Cambridge governance and make recommendations to the Cambridge City Council on how to improve and modernize the city’s charter.
Under Cambridge’s current “Plan E” form of government, the city is led by a mayor, city manager, and the City Council, who each have distinct leadership roles and responsibilities. Cambridge’s mayor leads the city politically and ceremonially, while the city manager is an administrative leader, tasked with overseeing Cambridge’s city departments and making recommendations to the City Council. The City Council itself adopts policies that it requests the City Manager to pursue and oversees Cambridge’s finances.
The Charter Review Committee hopes to recommend a more centralized form of leadership to the Cambridge City Council, consolidating the responsibilities of the mayor, city manager, and City Council into fewer roles.
Tuesday’s meeting began with a short presentation discussing the two alternative forms of leadership: a strong mayor system with a CFO or a city manager system.
Under the strong mayor proposal, Cambridge would be led by a mayor who would retain most of their current duties while also taking on some of the city manager and City Council’s administrative and budget responsibilities. The mayor would be advised by a CFO, who would help them draft and implement economic initiatives.
The latter proposal would see the city manager and City Council work together to govern Cambridge with a weak unelected mayor, with the city manager taking on many of the political and ceremonial roles currently fulfilled by Cambridge’s mayor.
After hearing about both forms of leadership, the Charter Review Committee spent the rest of the meeting discussing each method’s costs and benefits.
Many committee members questioned which form of leadership would be more representative. Proponents of the strong mayor argued a mayor would be more directly accountable to citizens than a city manager because they are elected. Committee member Ellen Shachter said she believes the strong mayor would “infuse more democracy” into Cambridge’s system of government.
“I just feel like we’re lost in the conversation without an elected leader,” committee member Jennifer Gilbert said.
Other committee members, however, said a City Council and city manager would be more representative.
“A city manager is going to be more accountable to all of the people of Cambridge,” said committee member and Harvard Law School professor Nikolas Bowie. “The city manager isn’t elected and by virtue of not being elected, will not be blown one way or the other by the political winds.”
“I’m really concerned that somebody could put a lot of money into a mayoral run and be able to run a campaign and essentially buy an election,” added committee member Lisa Peterson.
Beyond representation, the committee also focused on expertise, with members debating which form of leadership would better enable the drafting and implementation of effective city policies.
Several committee members expressed concerns that a mayor — who under the current system holds few financial responsibilities — would not be well-equipped to handle Cambridge’s budget.
“There are some functions that require somebody to go who has a very thorough knowledge of the city budget,” said committee member Kathleen Borm. “Typically speaking, the mayor in the city doesn’t.”
However, other committee members said the proposed CFO role would enable the mayor to make well-informed financial decisions.
“I see a CFO as a way to get the best of both worlds,” Gilbert said. “Have professionalism, have leadership.”
After debating for nearly two hours, the Charter Review Committee closed the Tuesday session without reaching a consensus.
“I don’t have a strong sense that we’ve had a lot of changed minds tonight,” said committee member James G. Stockard Jr, who is a lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. “We have a pretty evenly split group at the moment.”
The Charter Review Committee hopes to return to the issue of leadership at their next meeting, where they plan to vote on which form of leadership to recommend to the City Council.
“I’ve always been massively impressed by what a wonderful diverse group this is and how it seems to me to reflect Cambridge in so many ways,” Stockard said. “Makes me feel much more comfortable about moving forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 26, 2023, at 4:44 p.m.
BOSTON — Former Harvard chemistry professor Charles M. Lieber was spared additional time in prison by a federal judge on Wednesday and ordered to serve six months of house arrest after he was convicted of lying to government investigators about his ties to China.
Judge Rya W. Zobel ’53 sentenced Lieber to one day in prison — time that the chemist had already served following his arrest — during a hearing at the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse, as well as two years of supervised release including half-a-year of house arrest and a $50,000 fine. Lieber, who appeared in the courtroom wearing a surgical mask, hugged his attorney Marc L. Mukasey after the hearing.
Lieber, 64, was also ordered to pay $33,600 in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service, an estimate for the federal tax revenue lost due to his failure to report his income from the Thousand Talents Program in 2013 and 2014. He had already paid the sum in a pre-sentence payment.
Mukasey told The Crimson after the sentencing hearing that he was “happy with the way it turned out.”
“Justice was done,” Mukasey added, before declining to comment further. Lieber declined to answer questions from a reporter as he left the courthouse.
Lieber was arrested on Harvard’s campus in 2020 and charged with making false statements to authorities investigating his relationship with the Wuhan University of Technology and involvement in the Thousand Talents Program, a Chinese government initiative to bring foreign researchers to the country.
Harvard placed Lieber on administrative leave immediately after his arrest and replaced him as chair of the Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department. Lieber was convicted of six felony charges — four tax offense charges and two counts of making false statements — following a six-day trial in December 2021. Lieber’s conviction was a key victory for the Department of Justice’s controversial China Initiative, which shuttered in 2022.
Lieber’s attorneys previously asked the court in a sentencing memorandum on Friday to spare Lieber from prison with a non-custodial sentence, citing his battle with advanced non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Prosecutors sought a sentence of 90 days in prison followed by a year of supervised release — in addition to more than $180,000 in fines and restitution — proposing to balance Lieber’s health concerns against the severity of his offenses, according to a sentencing memo filed by the government on Sunday.
Lieber is currently in remission, according to a note from his doctor included in the defense’s sentencing memo. The note added that the median duration of remission following Lieber’s treatment is three years and his cancer remains incurable.
In February, Lieber quietly retired from his post as a University Professor, Harvard’s highest faculty rank. Prior to this, Lieber had been on paid administrative leave from the University since 2020.
During the hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason A. Casey stressed the severity of Lieber’s offenses while arguing for a prison sentence.
“He was somebody who was willing to lie and to deceive to protect the thing that mattered to him most,” Casey said. “And that was his career.”
In his 2020 post-arrest interview with the FBI, Lieber said he joined the Thousand Talents Program because he believed his involvement would help him win a Nobel Prize. He also told the FBI agents he “wasn’t completely transparent by any stretch of the imagination” when he spoke with Department of Defense investigators in 2018 about his ties to China.
A non-custodial sentence, Casey said, would send a message that “if you’re a prominent professor, you have a prominent career, and you lie and you cheat and you deceive, including cheating on your taxes over a period of years, you get a slap on the wrist.”
Mukasey defended Lieber’s character, calling him a “patriotic and loyal American” and characterizing his offenses as an “aberrational activity in an otherwise moral, humble, and just life.”
“Charlie Lieber was never chasing money or fame,” Mukasey said. “He lives a modest lifestyle.”
“He grows pumpkins and he feeds goats,” Mukasey added. “That’s who he is.”
In a statement read aloud during the hearing, Lieber apologized to his friends, family, and former students for the “horrific experience” of his trial and conviction. His remarks at the sentencing hearing were some of his most extensive public comments since his 2020 arrest.
“The last three-plus years have been a truly horrific experience for me and my wife and my children, and I regret the things that brought me here,” Lieber said. “As you have heard, I have lost my job, my career, and my freedom — and I sincerely hope I will not lose what is left of my life given my poor health.”
“I hope that in the future — and this is whatever transpires — that I am again able with whatever life I have left to help young scientists learn to be successful, encourage and support them in their careers, and contribute to science that benefits humanity,” Lieber added.
Lieber displayed little emotion throughout the sentencing hearing, with his gaze cast down on the table in front of him. The only exception came when Lieber broke down in tears while apologizing to his late mother.
“It brings me great sadness, and tears often, that I couldn’t be with her as I should’ve at the end as a result of my actions,” he said, weeping. “Your memory is still very strong and dear to me, Mom. I will forever love you.”
During the hearing, Mukasey said that despite Lieber’s cancer currently being in remission, his immunocompromised state could make any exposure to disease in prison deadly.
“In prison, he will be a sitting duck for disease,” Mukasey told the judge. “In prison, he will not have access to medical care that he may need on a day-to-day basis.”
Casey said imprisonment was unlikely to pose a health risk for the former professor, arguing that any sentence could be “structured around the defendant’s medical treatment” and noting low Covid-19 rates in federal prisons.
Mukasey, however, disputed Casey’s characterization of Lieber’s current medical state.
“The case the government just laid out against professor Lieber is callous, it’s misleading, it’s naive, and frankly, it’s dangerous to his health,” he said.
“They sort of sound like, ‘He had a bad cold, he got over it, and now he’s free to go out and play with his friends,’” Mukasey added. “That is not the situation that he’s in.”
Casey clarified to the court that the government’s assessment was largely based on the note from Lieber’s doctor, Harvard Medical School instructor and oncologist Austin I. Kim.
Kim wrote that the effects of Lieber’s cancer treatment on his immune system “cannot be understated” and that he is “at risk of more severe and potentially life-threatening bacterial and viral respiratory infections, including COVID-19.”
Lieber’s attorneys also requested that the court not impose a fine, calling the government’s request for a $150,000 penalty “draconian” and insisting that Lieber was sufficiently punished through the financial consequences of his conviction, including the loss of his job at Harvard.
But Casey maintained throughout the sentencing hearing that Lieber should not be sentenced any differently by the court because he previously held a prominent position at Harvard, arguing that the University’s trust in Lieber “makes him more culpable.”
“The defendant can’t blatantly abuse the privileges that were extended to him by lying and then ask for leniency because those privileges have rightfully been revoked or suspended,” Casey said.
“As the court knows full well, it can’t be that the professor at Harvard is treated differently from the janitor at Harvard,” Casey added.
Mukasey also took aim at Harvard, criticizing the University for retaining a “fancy” lawyer for itself while not advising Lieber to seek counsel after learning that federal investigators were looking into the professor’s conduct.
“Harvard deceived him,” Mukasey said. “Harvard failed to tell him to get a lawyer when this whole thing started, and Harvard is still taking advantage of the research that he did.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on Lieber’s sentence and Mukasey’s criticism of Harvard during the sentencing hearing.
Mukasey said the case would deter academic misconduct at Harvard and nationwide, another reason to not impose a severe sentence on Lieber.
“They’ve all gotten the message,” Mukasey said. “They all see him sitting here. They all see him having lost his job. They all see him ruined.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard track and field team sent athletes to three different meets this past weekend. The distance team traveled to the Sean Collier Invite at MIT and the Wake Forest Invitational in Winston-Salem, N.C., while sprinters and throwers headed down south to the LSU Alumni Gold meet. The team posted another weekend of strong results, breaking four records across the three meets.
At the Sean Collier Invite at MIT, first-year Michaela Denson won the women’s discus with a throw of 48.32 m, placing her fifth in program history. In the men’s discus throw, sophomore Eros Bottino took second place with a throw of 48.46 m.
Sophomore Jeremiah Swett placed third in the javelin with a throw of 44.59 m, and in the long and triple jump, junior Julius Ewungkem took third place and junior Noah Miles took second place, respectively.
For the runners, first-year Molly Malague won the women’s 3000 m steeplechase in 10:57.03 seconds. Senior Maya Rayle and sophomore Annelies Quinton both got on the podium for the women’s 1500 m run, placing in first and third respectively.
The distance runners continued their winning streak at Wake Forest, breaking three school records and an Ivy League record.
“The mindset for a lot of people is just like ‘race the competition’ with the main goal being to get a regional time qualifier,” said sophomore Graham Blanks about his teammates’ mindset going into the meet. “You let the race do its thing, compete with the other athletes, and you’ll probably get a good time out of it.”
Junior Maia Ramsden led the way for the Crimson, setting the new Harvard women’s 1500 m record by a full second, running 4:11.73 seconds to finish fourth in the event. Her new time puts her in 13th place in NCAA rankings. Her teammate first-year Penelope Salmon ran a time of 4:16.68 seconds to place 12th in the event, putting her in fourth place in the Crimson records books.
In the men’s 1500m run, first-year Vivien Henz ran a full three seconds faster than the previous Harvard record, setting the new time to beat in 3:39.78 seconds. His teammates sophomores Joe Ewing and Noah Ward followed shortly behind, securing second and fifth place in the Crimson record books.
“I guess I was more relieved than anything else,” said Henz in reflection on his new record. “It’s been a long time coming. I knew I was fit enough to break it, it was just a matter of when. It wasn’t really happening over the regular season but I got it done.”
Blanks, the Harvard and Ivy League record holder for the men’s 5000 m run, broke his own record again in a time of 13:24.91 seconds. His record-breaking race was enough to win the event, as well as earn him second place in the NCAA. Sophomore Ella Gilson ran a time of 16:16.52 seconds to get second place in the women’s 5000 m, and put her fifth place in Crimson history.
“I was pretty happy,” Blanks said about his new records. “A lot of the distance records have been falling over the past few years, so I wasn't elated or anything, which is a good sign for the program. Breaking a school record is kind of the expectation for Acer and [me] at this point.”
Harvard won the 10,000 m run, with junior Acer Iverson running 29:13.54 seconds to get first place in the men’s, and senior Eloise Freitag running 34:28.27 seconds to get first place in the women’s race. In the 3000m steeplechase, sophomore Isabella Goldstein and first-year Kristin Otervik took sixth and seventh place, respectively, placing themselves in the top three in Crimson history. In the men’s steeplechase, sophomore Reed Pryor ran a time of 8:50.63 seconds to take third place in the event and place him fourth in the record books.
“Everyone knew they were going to do well at that meet,” Henz reflected on the outcome of the meet. “We had eleven regional qualifiers. People were just coming in excited and they knew what they had to do.”
Over in Louisiana, the Harvard sprinters and throwers continued to have success. The throwers started the day off with multiple first-place finishes as well as a school record.
First, sophomore Kenneth Ikeji broke yet another school record, throwing 73.24 meters in the men’s hammer throw to win the event, as well as rank fourth in the NCAA. His throw was also far enough to set the facility record by a full centimeter.
In the same event for the women’s, senior Stephanie Ratcliffe won as well, throwing 69.50 m. Her teammate sophomore Cara Salsberry took third place with a throw of 57.19 m.
In the men’s shot put, senior Alexander Kolesnikoff took first place with a throw of 19.81 m, keeping up his undefeated streak in the event. Senior Sarah Omoregie and senior Estel Valeanu got first and second place in the women’s shot put, throwing 16.83 m and 16.01 m respectively.
Valeanu also returned for the women’s discus throw, where she took first place.
Sophomore Victoria Bossong ran a time of 2:06.53 seconds to earn first place in the women’s 800 m run, as well as put her third in the Harvard record books. The women’s 4x100 m relay team of first-years Cam Henry and Jonas Clarke and juniors Lance Ward and Jaeschel Achampeong ran a time of 40.19 seconds to tie their recently set school record in the event.
The women’s 4x400 m relay team of Bossong, sophomore Izzy Goudros, senior Tina Martin, and sophomore Chloe Fair earned second place with a time of 3:34.64, placing them third in the record books.
Next up, the team will travel to the historic Penn Relays hosted by the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Pa. which takes place from Thursday, April 27th to April 29th.
“The goal stays the same, it’s just to win as a team,” Blanks said about the team’s Heptagonal Championships goals. “We’re excited to take another crack at a Heps Championship, and finally try to win one.”
“[For the distance guys] we lost this Fall to Princeton by two points, and at the indoor championships we lost by one point,” he continued. “Tensions are running high — it’s gonna be a pretty intense weekend. We’re all pretty excited and we’re just trying to set ourselves up the best we can to succeed and bring home that trophy.”

Sections
As the year comes to a close, it feels like all of your friends and/or estranged suitemates have performances they’re participating in. If you want to show up with flowers to support them, we have compiled a list of options for all preferences!
Trader Joe’s near the SEC 
First on our list is our favorite finance bro: Mr. Trader Joe. This Trader Joe’s is a little far from campus (a 20-minute walk according to Apple Maps) but you can also take the shuttle to the SEC and have a moment living life as a CS student but without the perpetual stress! There were a lot of options in terms of flowers, including “Unkillable” wooden bouquets for $14.99 if you want something more resistant to Harvard students’ commitment problems. The highest price for a (live) bouquet was $12.99, so you won’t break your bank after a semester of dining out. You can also do some grocery shopping while you’re here if you want to eat in your dorm some days and avoid HUDS food poisoning (or “gastrointestinal illnesses”).
Bouquet Cost: $13.86 + Emotional labor of going all the way to the SEC
Pros: Cheapest, lots of variety, yummy snacks available (great for ur tummy)
Cons: Not as ~aesthetic~, yummy snacks available (bad for your wallet)
Brattle Square Florist
Next on our list is Brattle Square Florist! The beloved flower shop in the Square was set to close last year but then announced it would remain open and it has since moved to a new location at 52 Brattle St. If you ask for a bouquet of flowers within a certain budget, they will make one for you after asking for what colors you would like. The bouquet pictured above was $15.94 and came with a lot of flowers! Maybe not so great if you’re bad at making decisions (how hard was it for you to choose a concentration?) but amazing if you want a unique bouquet!
Bouquet Cost: $15.94
Pros: Customizable, supporting local businesses <3
Cons: A little more expensive
The Other Trader Joe’s
If you want to take a little walk along the river to maximize the spring vibes, you can also go to the other Trader Joe’s! Very similar to the one in the SEC so we didn’t go over there to take pictures, pls use your imagination <3.
Pros: Cheapest, yummy snacks available (great for ur tummy)
Cons: Not as ~aesthetic~, yummy snacks available (bad for ur wallet)
Petali Flowers
Across the street from the old Jefe’s location lies Petali Flowers, a whimsical escape from school where you can romanticize your life for a moment and pretend you live in a magical cottage in the woods. The shop is on the more expensive end of our list, but the vibes are cute and there’s lots of neat gifts to buy if you want an addition to your flowers (like a candle but shhh don’t tell your building manager). When you ask for a bouquet within a budget, they may ask you to pick one flower you like and build the rest of the bouquet around it.
Bouquet Cost: $14.88
Pros: cute gifts to buy for ur friends, pretty wrapping
Cons: most pricey, not as many flowers for the price
Although there are many options for flowers on this list, you really can’t go wrong with any of these and I am sure the recipient will appreciate it either way!. We hope this guide was helpful if you’re looking for somewhere to buy flowers for your friend/your boo/yourself <3!
