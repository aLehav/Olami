After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 6, 2016, at 9:48 a.m.
Beneath the artistic and social movements of the Harlem Renaissance, behind closed doors and drawn curtains, everyday stories of crafting and redefining identities lie at its heart and soul. On Oct. 8, BlackCAST presented such stories in “Songs of the Harlem River” at the Loeb Experimental Theater. Woven together from five separate one-act plays, “Songs of the Harlem River” comprised a thorough exploration of black culture as it evolved from the Harlem Renaissance.
The five stories each examine a different aspect of the development of social issues for African-Americans, starting with “The Girl From Bama” by Ralf M. Coleman, which follows a young woman who struggles to balance Southern traditions with homosexuality. In the second act, “The Deacon’s Awakening” by Willis Richardson, families adapt to women’s suffrage and the women exercise new freedoms for the first time. The following act, the “Blue-Eyed, Black Boy” by Georgia Douglas Johnson, as its title suggests, centers on a black mother whose son’s father cannot be publicly revealed. Next comes “Exit, an Illusion,” by Marita Bonner, a nightmarish scene of a lover’s deepest inner fears. Finally, “The Starter” by Eulalie Spence addresses a very present issue in modern day Harlem, exploring the discontentment of African-American workers with the unskilled labor roles they are expected to fill. Despite these stories’ diffuse plots and writers, director Darius Johnson ’18 united their themes into a compelling account of identity and history in an adaptation.
The same six actors played various roles across the acts, and each showed talent and versatility. Aside from a few awkward moments of detachment, Bryant W. Huggins ’19 was engaging and ambitious. Maddie Trice ’20 shone, especially in “The Deacon’s Awakening” as a young girl ready to exercise her new suffrage rights. In the same act, Huggins and Caleb M. Lewis ’17, an inactive Crimson arts editor, made a humorous duo in portraying misogynist fathers. Though their reactions and misconceptions evoked laughs, the play served as a sobering reminder of the struggles that women faced less than 100 years ago.
As Dot in “Exit, an Illusion,” originally written as a female role, Nicholas Whittaker ’19 pierced souls with his self-conscious confessions and pleading calls for love. In stark contrast, Lewis, as his controlling housemate, rejects Whittaker’s pleas and puts up emotional defense mechanisms in fear of being hurt. His cold shell is also a complete reverse of the comic portrayal that he takes on in a different act earlier.
Similarly, the other actors impressively swung back and forth and scratch personalities completely. Even through the character changes, Lethu A. Ntshinga ’18 delivered a consistently powerful performance in all her roles, establishing both presence in her poise and voice, but her strength in the “Blue-Eyed, Black Boy” especially stood out. Kelcee A. Everette ’18 carried with her the just the right air of nervousness that her character requires in the first role, but easily reestablished confidence as needed throughout the rest of the play.
Lighting by Eliza B. Mantz ’18 and Cole Edick '17, and set design, by Madison E. Johnson ’18, was another source of cohesion. Between the acts, soulful music played. Flapper dresses, trench coats, and rustic furniture in the sets grounded the play’s portrayal of the Harlem Renaissance. The family room that the set mostly resembled took on a homey and warm lighting. In some moments of starkness, the lighting appropriately dimmed and shone with blue-purple tones.
The last act resonated with strikingly familiar details like the neighborhood park bench one can find in many a city today, and this recognizable context drove home the sentiments from each one-act. Funny yet poignant and evocative, “Songs of the Harlem River” intertwines a dazzling fabric from the literature of one of America’s most vibrant movements in history.

A previous version of this article misstated the class year of Darius Johnson '18. The article also incorrectly indicated Madison E. Johnson ’18 was a light designer. In fact, she was set designer.

Let’s play a game. Here are two questions. There are no wrong answers (as long as you say the right answer). Question one: What do Kierkegaard, Dostoyevsky, and a cultural artifact from the late 2000s have in common? An invocation of the unconditional duty to love? A paradoxical relationship to rationality? A nuanced position on present day hostility to the reincarnation of Christ? An understanding of the unique location of the demonic within the human psyche—a defiance of freedom to avoid integrated selfhood? The answer, of course, is all of the above.
That was a warmup. Question two: What is that cultural artifact in question? Stop when the answer is apparent. A copy of that cultural artifact is located at Harvard. Specifically, in a room near the Charles River. The cultural artifact plays on my television. That television is connected to an Xbox. That Xbox contains a game. That game is “Nazi Zombies.”
“Nazi Zombies” can be played as an existential treatise that emphasizes the meaninglessness of human existence. (Is life meaningless because one plays “Nazi Zombies,” or is “Nazi Zombies” meaningful because life is meaningless? Who gets to derive meaning from life? Is this parenthetical going on for far too long? Is this parenthetical the embodiment of meaninglessness? These are all important questions that are derived from “Nazi Zombies.”) Every shot at a zombie mindlessly chasing after one of your teammates is the physical manifestation of unconditional love for your teammates. Developing the theme, the simple act of self-preservation by (once again) killing an undead horde could represent Kierkegaard’s formulation of “proper” self-love.
However, “Nazi Zombies” is no mere regurgitation of these writers’ philosophical frameworks. It develops them to de-fertilized grounds of nihilism. There is no way to win the game—its rounds extend infinitely. And while human life is devalued through the inevitability of death (not to mention the thousands of zombies murdered throughout the course of one game), “Nazi Zombies” offers a glimmer of existential hope. Emerging from your character’s inevitable death is the not-played potential of unending rounds: a horde of zombies that will presumably still emerge from their poorly made graves even after your character’s death. Death is not the end; it’s a momentary pause as the world goes on—the bright glimmer in a sprinting zombie’s eyes. Naturally, this was the game designer’s intention.

Who among us has not watched cable news and wondered if maybe, just maybe, they might try singing about tax policy instead of talking it through?
The Gregory Brothers, or “schmoyoho,” as they’re known on YouTube, are a group of musicians who do just that. Using autotuning technology and a knack for video editing, Michael Gregory, Andrew Gregory, Sarah Gregory, and Evan Gregory transform news into songs by a process they call “songification.” In case you’re wondering why you should care, their art is starting to be recognized by big names in media. They started uploading videos on YouTube in 2009; these days, their videos and directorial statement appear in the op-ed section of The New York Times’s website. Much of their music is based on political news, which means that this election season was ripe for songification. Enter “Songify the Election: 2016,” their latest full album, released just in time for election day.
The nature of making music out of real conversations means that not all of the tracks are hits lyrically. For example, “We Need Brain,” a songification of the GOP primary debate[comma] and “Me & Bernie, Bernie & Me,” their version of the Democratic National Convention, aren’t as lyrically complex or interesting as the other songs. They lack the same immediate appeal and, generally speaking, don’t have the same lyrical flow as the other tracks.
That said, the production on every song in the album is great without exception. The group credit various artists with “additional songification” and mixing but seem to write and perform the music themselves. In particular, “Bad Hombres, Nasty Women,” a songification of the final presidential debate, features a great complex backing track with a fabulous hook delivered in part by special guest “Weird Al” Yankovic. “Why should you run the show / Tell us ‘cuz we need to know” is both catchy as hell and the most salient question citizens could ask during the debates.
“Songify the Election: 2016” isn’t designed as a unified experience, though; the songs are grouped into this album by subject, not style. Whereas “Bad Hombres” most closely resembles a serious rap battle, TGB’s take on the presidential town hall, “Who’s Gonna Work it Out” (titled “TRUMP CLINTON FACE OFF” on YouTube), features guest Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the funky debate moderator and employs an upbeat backing track and lyrical tone, turning the second presidential debate into something you might expect to hear in a retro diner.
Coming in at a close third and fourth respectively for best tracks are “Call Sean Hannity” and “Feel the Bern Final.” The former demonstrates handily The Gregory Brothers’ ability to craft truly unique hooks from a few seconds of dialogue (in this case taken from the first presidential debate), while the latter demonstrates their truly incredible musical talent: The song is just under a minute and a half long, but the musical acrobatics of the electric guitar backing lines taken from Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton’s debate would justify a much longer piece.
If you’re a first-time listener, however, I highly recommend you watch the videos on YouTube. The Gregory Brothers put a lot of work into their videos, and it shows. The songs are meant to be experienced as videos, and that’s how you should experience them if you can.

One of Winslow Homer’s most striking works, “Summer Night,” has arrived at the Harvard Art Museums, on loan from the Musée d’Orsay until July. The enigmatic 1890 painting of a Maine seascape comes to Cambridge, Homer’s own birthplace, as the result of a painting swap with Paris’s Musée d’Orsay, which in turn borrowed Frédéric Bazille’s “Summer Scene” from Harvard’s collections for a large-scale exhibition on Bazille. According to Harvard’s curators, “Summer Night” marks a significant turning point in Homer’s art and a unique—if temporary—addition to Harvard’s collection.
Cassandra Albinson, the Margaret S. Winthrop Curator of European Art, noted that the painting’s synthesis of American and Parisian Impressionism is uniquely at home in the galleries of the Harvard Art Museums. “One of the things we do in our division is mix European and American art from around the same time,” she said. “A lot of museums don’t do that, but we feel that it is an important thing to do, and [‘Summer Night’] seemed like it would be a really important touchstone for us.”
Equally excited about the painting’s temporary residence was Ethan Lasser, head of the museum’s division of European and American art, and the Theodore E. Stebbins, Jr., Curator of American Art. “It’s a moment in Homer’s career that we really don’t have represented in our collection, and it is a particularly high moment in his career,” he said. “ We have Homers from 25 years earlier that share aspects of this painting or foreshadow aspects of this painting. In this way, it sits nicely in our collection.” He added that the painting forms a key element in the second-floor gallery devoted to American and European art dating from the first Impressionist exhibition in Paris in 1874 to the outbreak of World War I in 1914. “It’s a moment when American and European art really intersected, which is kind of the grand argument of this whole installation,” he said.
Albinson said that although it seems strange to request an American painting from a French museum, it is appropriate to bring “Summer Night” back to its roots. “We thought it brought a lot of iconic American [imagery] for people to look at…. Also, maybe because it’s not by a French artist, the [Musée d’Orsay] could sort of imagine it coming here for a longer time. We felt it was a very high quality piece they were offering us,” she said. “We do have a collection of French Impressionism, so when we were looking at what the Musée D’Orsay had, it was hard to find a piece that we felt we had to have by a French artist that we can’t represent well in our galleries. But this was something that we didn’t have, so we felt it would be a cool thing for people to see.”
The painting, which shows two women dancing in the moonlight and a cluster of silhouetted figures juxtaposed against a glistening seascape, has a history of neglect that contrasts with its current prominence in the museum galleries. Homer painted “Summer Night” in 1890 after spending time in Paris. He showed the work first in 1891 in New York City, to mixed response. For 10 years, Homer attempted to sell the painting in America but was unsuccessful. In 1900, he sent the painting to the Exposition Universelle in Paris, where it was the recipient of a gold medal and was purchased by the French State.
Lasser noted that this painting reflects the ways in which American art was changed by American artists who were traveling abroad and were inspired by European art.  “[‘Summer Night’] has so much French painting in it. Even as it’s a subject of rugged Maine coastal life…, it’s a very Parisian picture. It’s in America for a decade, and he can’t sell it,” he said. “All of his other seascapes are high dramas of men rescuing women or the storms coming over your shoulder. They’re big pictures of these pregnant moments of something terrible that is about to happen. This painting is obviously not that at all: It’s more Impressionist in its subject. It is, then, unsurprising that American audiences didn’t like this painting, as it had none of the drama [of Homer’s other works].”
Displaying “Summer Night” also inspired Albinson and the Harvard Art Museum curators to consider which works could complement it and to bring some new pieces out of storage and into the gallery. “[‘Summer Night’ has] these very dark and moody colors. [Homer] made us rethink what we’re doing in the gallery here, so we decided to reinstall so we could showcase similarities between his work and work by artists like Whistler,” Albinson said. Albinson also compared the works in this room to the other Impressionist galleries. “A lot of times in Impressionist galleries, we talk about light, and Impressionists are very interested in the way natural light makes things look. But we thought, let’s think a little about darkness and night scenes and nocturnes,” she said. “It’s nice since it has allowed us to rethink how we display objects from our collection.”
The curators plan to build on the painting’s mystery as a focal point for discussion and learning. Lasser and Albinson were both excited to observe aspects of the painting that did not appear in reproductions and are organizing a variety of programs around close looking in the gallery. “One of the privileges of having a painting like this here is the more you look at it with other people, the more is revealed,” Lasser said. “I’m [still] at the stage of interpreting. What I’m seeing is still changing.”

The premise of “Burly Men at Sea” is simple. The indie game recounts different adventures by three “burly” men, giving the player a short experience of captivating and well-written storytelling and an incredibly nostalgic feeling at sea. References to well-known stories such as the Biblical Jonah and the whale or the Greek sirens bring about a wistful smile and make for, overall, a charming, homey experience.
The first playthrough of “Burly Men” takes no longer than 40 minutes, but the game features a branching storyline and allows for repetition of the game to explore other aspects and storylines. The emphasis on player exploration is as if you were, in fact, the titular burly men on their own absurd yet endearing adventures. “What sort of tales?” one of the burly men asks a prophetic old man after being promised legendary adventures if he follows a blank map. “That depends on what sort ye choose,” the old man responds, and the game certainly delivers.
The game’s minimalistic art style and playful music are particularly compelling. The art is reduced to simpler, rounded shapes of the objects in question, and yet there is still an incredible attention to detail. While the main narrative dominates the player’s attention, many small background elements are interactive: fire that you can put out, bookshelves that you can rattle, and puffins that you can tickle. These additions supplement the folksy, playful tone of the game.
Storytelling is also a key factor in the game’s success. “Burly Men” manages to strike an excellent balance between humor and levity on the one hand and seriousness, mystery, and intrigue on the other. The writing naturally draws you in and works effectively in tandem with the art to make a fanciful and fun game. The sound effects serve only to add onto the quirky likeability of the game: An upbeat nautical theme and spectacular a cappella voices play in the background. Sometimes the sound effects are used for comic effect, like a blacksmith with a voice explicitly saying “Ching! Ching!” in time with his falling hammer. These additions add a subliminal layer of humor to the surroundings of the characters that you are leading.
The only possible complaint with this game lies in the mechanics. Logistical problems are common to the genre of minimalistic indie games, such as Playdead’s “Limbo” or Starbreeze Studios’s “Brothers.” In “Burly Men,” the game mechanics can be very frustrating at first; during my first playthrough, there was an interaction with a jellyfish that I was completely unsure how to approach. As a result, receiving the “bad outcome” felt undeserved and caused by the game’s lack of instruction. The mechanism for moving between screens is likewise difficult and unintuitive on a computer, though it would be considerably easier on mobile.
This game is filled to the brim with wonderful personality that speaks to adventure and discovery. A masterpiece of minimalistic visuals, lighthearted voices, and jocular writing, “Burly Men at Sea” will appeal to anyone with at least a sliver of childish adventure at heart.

“Embodied Absence: Chilean Art of the 1970s Now” is a new exhibition at the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, but one might encounter pieces from it, such as Luz Donoso’s “Señalamientos con cuerpo estrecho” (Signage with Narrow Body), while taking a walk through Cambridge. This is not the exhibition’s only unconventional aspect—it also largely involves performance art. The works on display were created during and in response to Augusto Pinochet’s repressive regime, and many of them are meant to be ephemeral to avoid political persecution. Bringing them back to life, the exhibition aims to clarify and comment on the political situation of 1970s Chile while also overcoming the cultural, geographical, and historical distance between the works’ original creation and today.
Part of the exhibition was Carmen Beuchat’s dance performance “II not I (Two Not One),” which was performed at the Carpenter Center last Thursday. “We worked with principles of dance from the 1970s, but we didn’t know what the music was and basically went with the instincts and memories that Carmen had of the piece,” curator Liz Munsell said. “We knew that we couldn’t make a recreation of the piece, so we called it a reconstruction.” The performance, accompanied by minimalist electronic music, consists of two tent-like constructions, each concealing a dancer, who move two pieces of fabric, one black and one white, in a dialogue of movement that ends with the two dancers merging underneath the black structure. The work was a collaboration between Beuchat and younger dancers, who were in fact born in the ’70s. Munsell thinks that this connection links the performance to the present moment and brings an additional layer of significance to the originally historical piece.
“I see [in the performance] this relationship between being apart and coming together through dialogue and confrontation and how the performance relates to what was going on in Chile at the time,” said Lina Britto, an assistant professor at Northwestern University’s department of history who was also an audience member. “It was a society that was really fragmented by violence and terror, and it was going through this whole process of finding their way together again.”
The exhibition also features a number of photographs and videos documenting previous performances. Many of them were about the series of actions that Chilean artists and art collectives carried out to contrast Pinochet regime with the the overthrown socialist president Salvador Allende, who had run a campaign called “Half a Liter of Milk.” For instance, one art collective named CADA distributed milk in poor neighbourhoods of Santiago de Chile. Another art collective, UNAC, disposed red dye into Santiago’s Mapocho river as a tribute to the thousands of victims of the regime.
Another example of the impermanence of the works is Catalina Parra’s “Imbunche gigante,” a representation of a legend where the protagonist Imbunche’s orifices were shut to stop evil forces from leaving them. The artist intended this piece as a metaphor for the violent suppression of individuals from the regime, and the original work was made of materials that eventually disintegrated. “These works could actually be a kind of danger [for the artists] if they had a lasting physical presence,” Munsell said.
“Embodied Absence” is an adaptation of an exhibition that took place last year in Chile, but the very act of putting it up at Harvard seems to affect its purpose in both places for viewers. Juan Necochea, a Chilean visitor of the Harvard exhibition, said, “We don’t really have that much visibility of art post-1973 [the year of Pincohet’s coup d’etat] in Chile. It’s not something Chilean memory in general reaches…. Everything after 1973 is very biased or just simply a lie.”
Liz Munsell pointed out that the Harvard exhibition featured far more newly-commissioned performances, but she also mentioned the exhibition’s emphasis on works of art that had been left out of the Chilean national art history, as many of the artists, such as Cecilia Vecuña and Carmen Beuchat, had not been able to exhibit their works in their native Chile.
According to Munsell, another important connection between the exhibition and the specific venue lies in Harvard’s history. Henry A. Kissinger, who used to be a professor of government at Harvard, was heavily involved with the coup in Chile. “Sadly, Kissinger has really been confirmed by documents that were unveiled through the Freedom of Information Act as the principal policy architect of the coup in Chile,” Munsell said. “And that is related to the development of what he was doing while he was at Harvard as a professor of government.”
The exhibition and performances of “Embodied Absence: Chilean Art of the 1970s Now” will be on view at the Carpenter Center through Jan. 8, 2017.

The collaborative effort of Harvard’s Theater, Dance and Media concentrators, professional staff members from around the globe, and American Repertory Theater Institute actors culminates in director Daniel S. Kramer’s unique rendition of “A Dream Play.” Creating a professional-quality show—the second in the TDM Department’s history—while simultaneously mentoring students at both Harvard and the ART's Institute for Advanced Theatre Training provided Kramer with a unique opportunity outside of the limits of commercial theater. “It was a great opportunity to explore one of the greatest pieces of avant-garde theater ever written, perhaps, and explore it in a safe context where failure was the only option and where I’d be working with really keen and ambitious minds,” Kramer says.
Fans of August Strindberg’s 1901 “A Dream Play” should expect to see a radically different version of the show. “I’ve cut probably 30 to 40 percent of Strindberg’s original, because it’s just… unperformable without an embarrassing sense of irony. It’s dated,” Kramer says. He describes “A Dream Play” as an exploration of how the American Dream has evolved. The plot follows Agnes, a daughter of the gods, after she enters Earth and experiences the struggles of daily human existence.
Thomas W. Peterson ’18, a joint concentrator in TDM and history and literature who acts in “A Dream Play” and serves as Kramer’s assistant director, considers the show meaningful to this generation for a number of reasons. “I think the way this adaptation works contemporizes this quite abstract play in a lot of exciting ways making it relevant—sometimes overtly, sometimes implicitly—to a lot of contemporary issues, from the presidential election to the Black Lives Matter movement to broader gender tensions in global politics,” Peterson says.
According to Kramer, one of the largest obstacles to overcome in producing “A Dream Play” was reimagining this pre-war play as one to which Harvard students could relate and feel passionate about. “It was finding a language that would keep, I hope, an MTV, video game, Mac desktop, Safari-web-surfing, social media audience engaged,” Kramer says. However, since the play explores so many controversial themes, Kramer wonders how exactly audiences will react to his rendition of the play. “I’m curious what audience’s responses will be to themes from their cultural and political and philosophical universe being unpicked in front of them.”
According to Ricky B. W. Davis Jr., an ART Institute student, the second-ever departmental show has proven a rewarding experience. “Everyone is bringing a lot of energy daily and just love and passion and really driving this forward, and it’s been a great process.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: November 10, 2016, at 11 p.m.
A previous version of this article incorrectly reported that the play featured American Repertory Theater actors, rather than acting students at the American Repertory Theater's Institute for Advanced Theatre Training.

The four drainpipes of Austin Hall, the Law school admissions building, tell a story. Each is surrounded by a small, intricate stone carving where the pipe intersects the windowsill. The first carving depicts a snake holding a small rodent in its mouth. The next three appear to show stages of a battle between a cat and a snake. On the second drainpipe, the carved cat holds the snake in its mouth, eyes wide in fear, while the snake’s coils writhe on all sides of its head. By the last carving, the cat rests atop the snake. Much like in a stop motion film, the architect, H. H. Richardson, has used still scenes to depict a sequence of events. Rather than the images changing before the viewer to create movement, the viewer moves around the building.
 I found myself unable to resist making several laps, and as I walked I asked myself what the significance of these drainpipes might be. My first thought was that the drainpipes serve as a symbolic assertion that what goes around comes around. The criminal snake preys on the weak and helpless rodent and then is brought to justice by the cat, the embodiment of the law. Because this is a building designed to help teach law, the sequence focuses on the process of the battle between cat and snake rather than on a victorious outcome.
This was, of course, only a gut reaction and did not satisfy my curiosity. Upon closer inspection, I found cat and snake combinations scattered throughout the facade of the building. Driven by the urge to learn more, I took to the Fine Arts Library, where I soon found myself surrounded by stacks of books about cats and snakes. Richardson’s muse was primarily Romanesque architecture, the product of a period when people viewed cats and snakes with a similar degree of wary respect and ambivalence. But cats and snakes—and mice—have been tied together throughout art history. Cat and snake imagery are linked in Egyptian, Buddhist, Kabbalist and North American tradition. Images from ancient Egypt depict a battle between the cat-goddess Bast and the evil snake Apophis. The North American feathered serpent of Teotihuacan has a feline head that is remarkably similar in appearance to the cats of the Austin hall drainpipes.
Richardson’s intentions are not immediately visible, so as casual viewers we cannot know whether he intended to establish a connection between any of these themes. Whatever the intention, it is remarkable that all of these stories and questions emerge from a set of drainpipes.
———
This is a sketch of an employee of the admissions office, who, along with her colleagues, made sure that I was there only to draw and not to glean information on the admission system. Much like some architecture, admissions is a largely hidden process with evident results.

The process of composing a letter involves several decisions. First, regarding the paper material: Will it be lined notebook paper or a store-bought card? Then there’s the matter of the writing medium: pen, pencil, or crayon? The form of the letter can also go in several directions. Will it be a love letter, structured as a sonnet? Perhaps an argumentative five-paragraph-style essay? Though our options are many, their mere existence creates constraints. We work within a domain of prior invention. Even the most bizarre painting will join the club of all other preexisting paintings, perhaps filed away in a specific group set aside for the avant-garde. The tradition of creation is as old as we are.
Despite our modern insistence on giving credit where credit is due, history doesn’t remember the accurate “first” of much anything. Scores of scientific inventions are attributed to either the wrong individual or only one contributor of many. For instance, not many people remember Elisha Gray, who filed his claim to the telephone patent just a few hours after Alexander Graham Bell on Valentine’s Day, 1876. The first humans to fly—Marquis d’Arlandes and Pilatre de Rozier in a hot-air balloon in 1783—have been cast in shadow by the wings of the Wright brothers; and the first woman to run for President of the United States—Victoria Woodhull in 1872—has been mostly dropped from recollection’s ballot. It’s even more difficult to assign innovative credit in our history of aesthetic expression, which stretches past recorded history. Ownership is a preoccupation of today—the first recorded use of the word “originality” didn’t even occur until 1742—but history engaged with collective oral tradition and the concept of passing down from generation to generation. The oldest known song, derived from musical notation found on ancient Syrian tablets, is believed to be around 3400 years old. A woman by the name of Sappho was penning Greek lyric poetry back in the 5th century BC. And just a decade ago, paintings around 40,000 years old were found in a cave in France.
Even plagiarism itself is not an original action. Credit for the quip “Good poets copy, great artists steal,” which is frequently attributed to T.S. Eliot, has also been given to a dozen other people, from composer Igor Stravinsky (“A good composer does not imitate; he steals”) to satirist Oscar Wilde (“Talent borrows, genius steals”). People can either contribute to the existing canon of “originals,” or they can contribute to the tradition of stolen ideas, but there is no way to avoid contributing to one or the other. In form, even the new is not new.
Do not despair for the lack of the originality. Our available media of expression are not fixed. While it is impossible to recall a time before poetry and pottery, innovations proliferate. A beautiful example is the CD, invented in the 1970s. The very first sound featured on the commercial CD was a 1979 recording of Claudio Arrau performing Chopin Waltzes. Arrau himself was invited to the German plant to press the start button of the first CD. And just like that, Chopin had become reproducible at the press of a button. With every spin of the disc, we can hear hundreds of years of artistry: The team at Philips and Sony, inventor of the CD; Claudio Arrau, inventor of the interpretation. Frédéric Chopin, inventor of the notes; Bartolomeo Cristofori, inventor of the piano; spiraling backwards, on and on.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“As long as I remember to vote this November, I am not throwing away my shot,” sang Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of the acclaimed Broadway musical "Hamilton," during a recent Saturday Night Live episode he hosted. As this seemingly never-ending election season reaches its final days, Miranda’s message is of vital importance for voters invested in the direction of their city, state, and country.
The outcome of the presidential election, for instance, appears in some forecasts to be far from a foregone conclusion. Although other predictions show a less close race, ultimately, the next president will not be decided until after polls close tonight. The two major parties’ candidates offer very different visions for our country, as do lesser-known candidates, so it is incumbent upon voters at Harvard and beyond to research the candidates, evaluate these visions, and cast their ballots.
Furthermore, the race for a majority in the Senate is of similar importance and greater uncertainty. Voters in many states must not only consider who they would like to see in the White House come January, but also the people who they would like to see on Capitol Hill sending legislation to our next president and voting to confirm a nominee for the Supreme Court vacancy. Because the impact of their decisions today will ramify for generations to come, voters should not take their civic duty lightly.
In many cases, voters will be able to voice their views on particular issues by voting on one of the 162 statewide ballot measures across the country. In Massachusetts alone, voters have the opportunity to weigh in on casinos, animal welfare, marijuana legalization, and charter school expansion. These measures, and those in other states, will have immediate impact on the direction of our country, and they must think carefully before supporting or opposing them.
Despite this paramount responsibility, deciding against voting may seem tempting. It is no small task to make an informed decision on measures and candidates up and down the ballot, and taking the time to cast a vote seems futile to many, especially in the age of predictions by websites such as FiveThirtyEight that seem to trivialize the influence of any individual voter. This sort of illogic and apathy erodes the core tenets of democracy; voting is of the utmost importance for eligible citizens concerned about the country’s collective future, as it is the most direct way by which they can influence the decisions our leaders will make.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’m not going to tell you to go vote today.
I can’t make you, and if you don’t want to vote, that’s your own choice.
I sent in my ballot a week ago. But if you’re still on the fence about going to the polls, I’m not going to fire up the rhetoric of hope or tell you that some presidential candidate will make America great again. I can’t fake that.
In fact, I’ll even admit that, if there were an election to break a person’s faith in democracy, this might be it.
One party has leaders that openly loathe their candidate and cling to him only because they think that they have to be team players in this election to survive in the next. The other party's candidate has been running for 30 years and was expected to win the nomination from day one.
One party was going to win all along. The other party is only in play because the talking heads have decided that when there are two parties, objectivity must be the midpoint between the two.
I feel resignation. The country feels resignation. This election is so bad that it has forced us to change our definitions of what bad actually means. It has turned Ted Cruz into a liberal savior and Bill Maher into a Bush defender. It has turned the Republican candidate for president into an admirer of a socialist from Vermont. It has turned racism mainstream and American exceptionalism into an afterthought.
This election has made millennials think their disillusionment is justified. We know that younger people generally don’t vote. But did you know that younger people consistently think far less of democracy than their elders? That statistically, nobody in the Western world cares less about democracy than the American millennial?
If you didn’t know that, are you even surprised?
In countries without the vote, people don’t really think about voting in the first place. They’re generally poorer and more desperate than us. They care about things like avoiding wars, going to university, and putting food on the table. It’s what young Americans think their lives are like.
It is only when you get the vote, however, that you realize how important it can be. Some of us come from communities where voting has not always been taken for granted. And we still consider the vote the bedrock right of a free society.
Voting matters. If you don’t like your leaders, you can vote them out. If you want to enshrine gender equality  and freedom of conscience, steady democratic pressure wins every time. If you want to end segregation, you can’t change George Wallace’s mind, but with the vote you can sweep his career into the dustbin of history. And without the vote—as happened in real life—you can’t.
People who are disillusioned with voting—like many millennials—do not reject voting itself but the premise that voting alone is sufficient to change the world. I get it. Democracy sometimes seems like three wolves and a sheep voting on dinner.
But while voting is not sufficient, it is necessary. Without voting, the First Amendment wouldn’t mean a thing. Without voting, there would have been no Lincoln to back up equality with power and no Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson to remind us what equal protection of the laws really means. Without voting, our country cannot draw a line in the sand and say, “They will go no further.”
I will not tell you to vote in this election. I will not tell you whom you should vote for. But know that while the prospect of voting in this election might not fill you with enthusiasm, it should nevertheless make you care.
I believe our country will draw a line today. But I don't have platitudes to give you about healing. I have no idea how we can bridge our divides. We can’t turn back time, though. We have returned to our nation’s cardinal sin, and if we are to move past our sin, “we must see it all, and deal with it all.”
I can’t tell you to vote, and I can’t make you care. But there is one thing I do want to leave you with. Yes, this is the worst election cycle in modern history. But our problems are not unique. Every country has its divisions and its sins and its broken dreams. And in all of human history, there have only ever been two kinds of countries—the ones that solve their problems with votes and the ones that solve them with guns. Only the ballot allows us to avoid the bullet.

“I’m a Trump guy,” tweeted former Illinois representative and talk show host Joe Walsh, “but, man, that’s not right.”
Walsh was referring to how, “For 9 days, over 20 million people early voted thinking the FBI had something big on Hillary.” It was a surprising break from reflexive partisanship, especially puzzling given Walsh’s other recent tweet about armed rebellion against a President-Elect Clinton.
Disappointingly, the tweet turned out to be in service of Walsh’s criticism of early voting. “Stop this early voting crazy. Quit making it so easy to vote,” he said. No joke: It is too easy to vote for Joe Walsh. Not too easy to commit voter fraud, mind you—too easy to vote. (Smarter men than I have written about how Republican-supported obstacles to voting, not near-imaginary voter fraud, represent the true threat to the electoral process. “Rigged” indeed.)
But, along the way, Walsh had a point: Elections must happen at a given time, and the proximity of news-cycle-altering events to that time can be frustratingly arbitrary. In his substanceless and maybe willfully dishonest letter to Congress 11 days before the presidential election, FBI director James Comey thrust his agency, and Hillary Clinton’s scandals, into the headlines for the campaign’s final stretch. News outlets from the predictable (CNN) to the baffling and disappointing (the New York Times) breathlessly covered the “development” for days, focusing not on the details of Comey’s letter but on self-fulfilling prophecies about how it would impact the polls.
Sure enough, though voters had absolutely no new information about Clinton’s behavior, the non-fire apparently had enough smoke to send undecideds scurrying to Donald Trump, who, to his tactical credit, uncharacteristically kept his mouth shut long enough for the spotlight to scorch his opponent. But, as polling aggregators FiveThirtyEight and RealClearPolitics reveal, Trump had actually been gaining ground since his debate-induced nadir around Oct. 18.
In fact, Trump’s support since clinching his party’s nomination has followed a predictable pattern. It rose after events like Comey’s highly critical non-indictment of Clinton, the Republican National Convention, and Clinton’s Sept. 11 health scare. It plummeted after such obviously disqualifying moments as when he delegitimized a federal judge based on his parents’ nationality, mocked the grieving parents of a fallen soldier, or crumbled in a debate, and of course after the Billy Bush tapes were released. Other than the Khan debacle, which coincided with Clinton’s “convention bounce,” Trump’s numbers largely rose and fell not against Clinton’s but against those of Gary Johnson and “undecided,” evincing that the voters causing these swings weren’t moderates but rather Republicans at the margins of Trump’s base, some of whom decided after each implosion that they couldn’t tolerate his racism/unpatriotism/immaturity/sexual assault.
But in between these turning points, Trump’s support ticked back up, a tenth of a percentage point at a time. After each incident, five to seven percent of the country dropped Trump in disgust, only to pick him back up over the next few weeks. What the hell gives?
I don’t know, of course, but one explanation makes sense to me. When Trump shatters each of these political norms, he remains, well, a major party’s nominee for President. In a strange tautology, whatever he does becomes part of the range of normal presidential-candidate behavior. As the norm adjusts, the voters who instinctively rejected his violations no longer see them as violations. For the polls to make sense, millions of Americans must exist who decided they could not stomach a man who brags about getting away with groping married women, only to decide—within weeks or days—that they could, after all, even before Comey’s letter.
That is, in a word, horrifying. In one wild ego trip of a campaign, Donald Trump—and, never forget, the establishment Republicans who enabled him—has already made sexual assault, overt prejudice, and indifference to reality more acceptable to his tens of millions of supporters and, probably, to future candidates on both sides of the aisle. He could lose by 10 and still have done incalculable damage to the political process and to the social fabric tenuously holding the country’s angry factions together.

A classroom in Hauser Hall was filled to capacity Monday afternoon as Tom Hardin, a white collar felon and subsequent FBI informant, recounted his experiences with insider trading and federal investigations to about 100 Harvard Law Students.
The Harvard Association for Law and Business hosted Hardin after he approached the organization about his desire to speak at the Law School. Hardin is currently visiting elite institutions across the country to share his “cautionary tale” about insider trading and white collar crimes, event coordinator David Kafafian said.
“Tom actually reached out to us and was quite frank in his introduction around who he was, that he was a convicted white collar felon, and what he did,” Kafafian said.
Hardin said he was first contacted by the FBI two years after he began insider trading. He was recruited to participate in Operation Perfect Hedge, a federal operation to curtail insider trading activities. As an informant, Hardin took on the pseudonym “Tipper X.”
Hardin described the moment the FBI first approached him—on a street in New York City as he was dropping off his dry cleaning.
“It was literally like right off of the TV. The dark suits [and] the wallet came out,” Hardin said, as he recalled his conversation with the agent.
“‘The FBI,” the agent said, according to Hardin’s memory. “Are you Tom? Come with us.’” The agent then said that the Agency knew about four of Hardin’s insider trade deals, according to Hardin.
“‘We are trying to get to two big individuals… You can help yourself by helping us build these investigations,’” Hardin said, recounting what the FBI agent told him.
Hardin then told anecdotal stories about his experience working as an FBI informant, some of which elicited vigorous laughter from the audience. While the conversation was equal parts serious and humorous, Hardin ended with a serious tone.
“I now look back and am able to analyze what happened… The one take-away I would like to leave with you today is that you are the average of the five people with whom you surround yourself. Choose wisely… Keep that in mind as you get into your competitive careers,” Hardin said.
Law student Coen Maas appreciated Hardin’s emphasis on morals.
“I enjoyed [Hardin] very much and what I liked the most… was when he talked about his own experience,” Maas said. “His ethical response to it is what I liked best.”

Along with electing the next president, voters in Cambridge Tuesday have the opportunity to both determine policy with four Massachusetts ballot questions and also reinstate a number of incumbent Democrats running in uncontested races.
At the top of the ballot is choice for President of the United States. The four tickets on the ballot are Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Republican nominee Donald Trump, Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party, and Massachusetts resident Jill E. Stein ’73 of the Green Party.
Clinton is expected to overwhelmingly win Massachusetts, according to polling website FiveThirtyEight. Recent polls place her lead in Massachusetts anywhere from 17 points to 32 points.
Cambridge voters will also vote in the uncontested race for U.S. House of Representatives. Incumbent Democrat Katherine M. Clark, a graduate of the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, is the only name on the ballot to represent Massachusetts’s Fifth District.
Voters will choose their candidate for State Senator and State Representative in two separate uncontested races. State Senator Sal N. DiDomenico and State Representative Marjorie C. Decker, both incumbent Democrats, are also the only names listed on the ballot.
Also up for reelection this year are Middlesex Sheriff Peter J. Koutoujian, a Democrat, and Democratic member of the Governor’s Council, Terrence W. Kennedy. The Governor’s Council is an executive body that serves as an advisory board to Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 on matters concerning judicial appointments, pardons and commutations, and treasury warrants.
Massachusetts’s four ballot questions have been the source of contentious debate throughout the state in recent months.
The two most controversial ballot initiatives are Question 2 and Question 4. Question 2 proposes an increase on the number of approvals for new or expanded charter schools, at most, 12 per year. The measure has split the normally unified bloc of Democrats in Massachusetts and promises to be a tight race.
Question 4 would legalize recreational use of marijuana. Massachusetts is one of five states considering legalization this year. According to the Crimson’s 2016 Election Survey, Harvard students overwhelmingly support the measure.
The two questions that have received less coverage are Questions 1 and 3. Question 1 would permit the state’s Gaming Commission to add one more slot-machine establishment consistent with the law. Polling by Suffolk University currently has the “No” vote in the lead.
Question 3 would “prohibit any confinement of pigs, calves, and hens that prevents them from lying down, standing up, fully extending their limbs, or turning around freely.” Current polling by Suffolk University currently has the “Yes” vote in a solid lead.
The polls open at 7 a.m. and are set to close at 8 p.m.

One Tuesday last month, Harvard’s highest-profile administrators mingled with members of the Economics Department to celebrate the announcement of Oliver Hart’s Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. Gathered in the ornate Faculty Room of University Hall, the crowd sipped champagne while listening to Hart reflect on his time at Harvard.
While he praised his colleagues and the University, Hart cautioned that his department—once considered the top economics faculty  in the country—could no longer be certain about its status.
“It’s true that we face some challenges,” Hart, who won the prize with MIT professor Bengt R. Holmström, said to the crowd. “We like to think of ourselves as the best Economics department, and I think there was a period when we clearly were. I think that’s less clear now.”
Still, the joyful scene at University Hall painted a different picture of the department than that of  the previous fall, when the department was still reeling from the loss of MacArthur “Genius” Grant winner Raj Chetty to Stanford.
His departure, in addition to no new hires in Economics, made 2015 “a particularly dark year,” Department Chair David I. Laibson ’88 said.
Some problems from 2015 remain this year—specifically, the need for more physical space. The Littauer building, where the Economics Department is currently housed, would need to expand by 50 percent to fully support the department.
But Hart’s Nobel Prize and the hiring of four tenure-track and one tenured professor leave Laibson optimistic about the future of the department.
STARTING TO REBUILD
Chetty is not the only professor from Harvard in the last decade to leave the Economics Department for Stanford. According to Laibson, the department has lost 10 professors to Palo Alto in the last decade, but has not attracted anyone from Stanford.
MIT, too, has poached several economists from Harvard in recent years. Just this year, Drew Fudenberg departed for MIT, and the department was not successful in recruited a tenure-track professor from their neighbor.
After this string of failures, the department turned a corner with the appointment of five new faculty members, including tenured economist  Xavier Gabaix, formerly of New York University. Laibson cites a renewed optimism about the department among potential hires for this shift in fortunes.
“In some ways you might say that we’re rebuilding from a period of departures, and a period where our recruitments did not succeed,” he said.
Laibson said that administrative support, at the divisional and University level, made this spate of hires possible.
In an interview, Hart said that the shock of high-profile departures gave the Economics Department the opportunity to make a case for increased administrative support.
“I think people were feeling a bit demoralized,” Hart said.  “With the help of the administration, [Laibson] has managed to move things in the other direction.”
Hart also said that the department’s recent success in hiring tenure-track faculty is a good sign. However, he said it is important not to become complacent.
In order for Harvard to retain its economists, University professor Jerry R. Green, a former chairman of economics, said the department must emphasize building relationships within the  faculty.
“We have to be building strong personal ties,” Green said. “If someone gets another offer, there’s already a deep personal relationship.”
‘A GREAT DISADVANTAGE’
When Chetty left the department for Stanford, one of the main reasons for his departure was, according to Laibson, lack of space. Harvard did not have room for his lab, whereas its west coast competitor did.
“All of our chief competitor departments—Chicago, Stanford, MIT, Princeton—have obtained new buildings in the last few years,” Laibson said.  “Literally in the last few years. And our building is from 1932.”
As a result of this lack of room, the department has converted common spaces such as lounges into offices, according to Laibson. In addition, many professors have labs far away from Littauer and there is not enough space in the building for every graduate student.
Green said he remembers a time when the layout of the department allowed for more informal communication and collaboration.
“That’s the kind of environment we should have in Littauer,” Green said. “An atmosphere where someone gets pizza and you sit around and talk and try something.”
Laibson said that converting lounges into office space is only a short-term solution, especially as enrollments in economics courses continue to grow.
“We’re really eager to solve this very serious problem,” Laibson said.  “It’s a great department with a great disadvantage.”
The department faces even greater space constraints because the Fine Arts Library—which is not affiliated with the department—is also currently housed in Littauer.
“I think in the future we’ll be a department that desperately needs more space, housing the Fine Arts Library,” Laibson said.
Still, Laibson said, the department is on the upswing.
“I feel that we’re on a good path,” Laibson said. “Of course we won a Nobel Prize, so that’s certainly done a lot to boost morale.”

After a brief closure, Algiers Coffee House opened its doors again to patrons hoping to sip on the cafe’s popular mint tea.
Algiers had been a fixture in the Square for 45 years until the cafe abruptly announced its closing last month on the eatery’s Facebook page.
The cafe will remain in its location on 40 Brattle St. in the building shared by the Brattle Theatre and restaurant Alden & Harlow. The restaurant will continue to serve Middle Eastern cuisine in addition to their drink selection, which includes the coffee house’s signature mint tea and Arabic coffee.
According to a press release from the Harvard Square Business Association on Monday, Algiers’ previous owner Emil Durzi has been suffering from a longtime illness and decided to close the cafe. Sami Herbawi, the owner of the middle eastern Andala Coffee House in Central Square, purchased Algiers from Durzi and decided to reopen the cafe with an expanded menu that also features the menu items served under Durzi’s ownership.
“We know that the new owners are just as passionate about a good coffee house as Emil was,” Executive Director of the Harvard Square Business Association Denise A. Jillson said. “We are hopeful that the tradition of very good Arabic coffee and wonderful Middle Eastern food will remain in that iconic little space.”
Jillson praised Durzi for his dedication to Algiers over the years.
“Emil worked very hard and lots of people in the Square knew that he was ill, but he kept pushing through it,” Jillson said. “I think the family spent a couple of weeks thinking about whether or not a family member could keep it going and ultimately they decided that it was best to turn the management over to another very well known coffee shop owner here in Cambridge.”
Students like Alec S. Bowman ’17 were relieved to hear of Algiers reopening.
“Their Arabian coffee is some of the only coffee in the Square that’s actually strong coffee, and their outdoor balcony is an awesome place to people watch while working,” Bowman said.  “I am glad that they have survived.”
Minnie Jang ’18 was “devastated” when she heard of Algiers closing last month.
“I associated it with lots of special memories,” Jang said.  “But it's awesome that they've already re-opened and hope the new owners maintain the same cozy ambience from before.”

A group of Divinity School students and staff exchanged differing opinions on the Mass. referendum questions on charter school expansion and the legalization of Marijuana on Monday.
The discussion was part of “Religion in the News,” a series of events intended to address the intersection of faith and the news hosted by the Center for the Study of World Religions.
Students and staff debated the voting measures over lunch. Associate director of the Center, Corey F. O’Brien, expressed her opposition to charter school expansion.
“Charter schools take away money from the public schools,” O’Brien said, who preferred reforming public schools. “Public schools will be severely burdened by the new charter schools.”
Divinity School student Vicky Lee disagreed, suggesting that charter schools could be a better alternative to unfixable school administrations.
“These smaller alternative systems work because they can improve the student experience a lot,” she said.
Participants were also divided on marijuana legalization. Center Director Francis X. Clooney said that traditionally the Catholic Church viewed marijuana use as a sin, as evidenced by the Boston Archdiocese’s decision to spend $850,000 against the legalization of marijuana last week.
However, Clooney noted that legalization is not as contentious in the Catholic community as abortion or assisted suicide.
“In the end, well-informed voters might be driven to think differently due to their religion, but still cast a vote according to their beliefs,” he said.
While some participants raised concerns about the unknown long-term effects of marijuana, Center events coordinator Ariella R. Goldberg suggested that the media portrayal of marijuana is skewed against legalization.
“The sky is not going to fall down should marijuana be legalized,” she said, after sharing her experience of living in Colorado after marijuana legalization.
Lee, similarly a proponent of legalization, was guarded about the long-term consequences of marijuana use, arguing that education about safe practices was essential.
“While marijuana is not a gateway to opioids, it can be a gateway to an addictive lifestyle that unaware younger people may regret in the long run,” she said.
Towards the event of the event, Divinity School student Benjamin Keller warned against always voting on the basis of religion.
“I have to balance my personal faith,” he said, “And refrain from imposing it onto others and ask ‘Does my religious view on an issue have to be everyone else’s view?’”

Audience members of the “Socially Engaged: Public and Private Storytelling” lecture at the Harvard Art Museums witnessed first-hand the importance of emphasizing humanity in visual media Monday night.
Sarah E. Lewis ’01, assistant professor of History of Art and Architecture and of African and American Studies, introduced artist LaToya Ruby Frazier by first invoking the words of President John F. Kennedy ’40. A video of him speaking on the role of art in society kicked off the lecture.
“We must never forget that art is not a form of propaganda, it is a form of truth,” he said in the video.
As Kennedy’s words lingered in the room, Frazier, who Lewis described as an artist who “soulfully lives out the ideals that JFK spoke about,” highlighted one of her most recent projects—her photographic work in Flint, Michigan for Elle magazine.
In covering Flint, Frazier said she had hoped to capture a more human side of the water crisis and had wanted to focus on the people who were suffering, an aspect of the story that she argued most major media outlets had neglected.
“The more I watched the magazines send in different photographers, I realized they were sending them in and bringing them out too quickly. These were some of the most prolific photojournalists out there, and they only left them in for a day,” Frazier said. “It’s all spectacle.”
Frazier spent five months in Flint, working very closely with Shea Cobb, a local resident, whom she described as “a divine appointment” who inspired her work. In keeping with her goal to promote the stories of marginalized people, Frazier played a clip from Cobb’s poem “Unfiltered,” which detailed her struggles during the crisis.
“People who are struggling day to day, living paycheck to paycheck, living under the worst conditions—they’re the most educated, smartest people in our society,” Frazier said. “If you want to know what a creative solution is in this situation, ask them because they’ve been living there for decades.”
The lecture was an extension of Lewis’s recent work. At the urging of Frazier, Lewis had accepted an offer to guest-edit an Aperture Magazine issue dedicated to the photography of the African American experience. The issue, “Vision & Justice,” inspired Lewis’s most recent class HAA 176E: “Vision and Justice: The Art of Citizenship” and a corresponding temporary installation at the museum.
Local resident Mu-Chieh Yun who attended the event said that Frazier’s talk would change the way she approached storytelling in her own work.
“It’s propelling me to be more confrontational in the work we’re doing and to not pay attention to building a larger readership,” Yun said. “If we’re able to tell the story and maintain its integrity, then we’re doing justice for the people we are interviewing.”

With the help of some big names in Massachusetts politics, the Harvard basketball program managed to raise more than $350,000 in fiscal year 2016.
Last month, Friends of Harvard Basketball, a group of alumni and parents who support the program, announced in their annual report that 192 donors contributed $356,966 in current use gifts to the men’s and women’s teams last fiscal year. These donations, as well as endowed gifts, made up 60 percent of the program’s revenues in fiscal year 2016. Travel makes up a plurality of expenses for the program.
“Harvard and the Department of Athletics provide the funding for a basic program,” the report reads. “It is the Friends funding that allows our teams to properly represent the excellence we all want and expect.”
The program hopes to raise $364,545 in the next fiscal year.
Among the donors were two names familiar to Massachusetts residents: Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 and state Attorney General Maura T. Healey ’92. According to the report, Healey donated between $100 and $499 to the program this past year. Paul J. Finnegan ’75, the University treasurer and a member of the Harvard Corporation, donated between $25,000 and $29,999 to the program in fiscal year 2016. While Healey gave a current-use gift for fiscal year 2016, Baker has donated at least $100,000 in an endowed fund. His contribution is one of 17 “AD Discretionary Endowment Funds,” which the program uses to generate income. 
Both Baker and Healey, who some have speculated could run against each other for governor in 2018, played varsity basketball for the men’s and women’s teams respectively during their time as undergraduates at Harvard. Healey even played professionally in Austria for UBBC Wustenrot Salzburg shortly after graduation.
The yearly fundraising results follow the announcement that NBA star Jeremy Lin ’10 donated $1 million to the University for undergraduate financial aid and renovations of the Lavietes Pavilion, set for completion by the 2017-2018 school year.
“This summer, we started the Lavietes Pavilion project with plans to renovate the lobby, locker rooms, offices, gym and the entire facility – something we know will improve the experience for both our student-athletes and the greater Harvard basketball community,” men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker wrote in the annual report. “We are incredibly grateful for these opportunities - none of which would be possible without your investment of time, resources and efforts.”
A new basketball arena to replace the Lavietes Pavilion, is a part of Harvard’s many projects in Allston. The construction project is slated to begin in 2020 and finish in 2024.
Harvard’s university-wide capital campaign, launched in 2013 with a goal of $6.5 billion, recently surpassed $7 billion. With about two years left in the campaign, Harvard has been focusing on meeting its goals for undergraduate financial aid and the Allston campus.
Harvard's men’s basketball team is currently in Shanghai for an exhibition game against Stanford.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an email sent to the entire Harvard faculty, staff, and student body, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said “much is at stake” in the upcoming graduate student union election on Nov. 16 and 17, writing “from my own perspective, the proposed union raises a number of questions.”
In the election, eligible undergraduate and graduate students will vote for or against authorizing the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers as their union. A collective  bargaining unit would include teaching and course assistants, as well as graduate student research assistants at the University.
When Garber last contacted students following the October agreement between the University and the union effort on when to hold the election, he linked to the Provost Office’s frequently asked questions about unionization. This time, Garber directly addressed specific questions in topic ranging from union dues to how unionization could affect the relationship between students and teachers.
Garber asked, in the email,  whether or not “one contract” could represent “a large and diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students.”
To answer his own question, Garber wrote, “There is no precedent for this breadth and diversity of schools and disciplines among student unions in the United States.”
In another question, Garber  asked, “Is a labor relations framework the best approach to strengthening such relationships and ensuring that each student has a successful experience at Harvard?”
Garber declined to comment directly to The Crimson about the email. Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven wrote in an email that Garber’s email was directed to the entire student body, as well as to staff and faculty, because “the outcome of this election will impact the entire Harvard community.”
“Like the HGSU-UAW, the University is reaching out to encourage discussion of the issues and a strong voter turnout among eligible students,” Cowenhoven said.
Jack M. Nicoludis, a spokesperson for the student union effort, wrote in an email that there has been an “intensification” of the administration’s actions to “oppose our effort to form a union,” and added that this has been going on “for the past year and a half.” He argued that Garber’s email was intended to make eligible students uncertain about how to vote.
The union effort has circulated petitions asking the University to remain neutral as students move forward with forming a union. Harvard has not signed a neutrality agreement, a decision which Nicoludis said was a disappointment to the HGSU-UAW. New York University did sign an agreement in 2013 when its graduate students voted in a union election.
Several undergraduate and graduate students said they had not yet read the email as of dinnertime Monday.
Shira Li ’19, an undergraduate course assistant, though, did read the email and appreciated it.
“I found the email pretty helpful (not one-sided) and thought it concisely summarized the main contentions surrounding the vote,” Li wrote in an email.
Ph.D. student Holly M. Dykstra, who said she is thinking of voting in favor of the union, also found the email insightful.
“I thought it was helpful to get a clearer understanding of the administration's point of view,” she wrote in an email.
Benjamin Franta, who graduated from his Ph.D. program last May, thought otherwise. Franta said he is ineligible to vote in the union election, but received the email because he is still an associate at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Last year, he said he was “peripherally” involved with the union effort.
Franta said he was “surprised” by how “overt” the email was.
“I was really surprised when I saw the email because it’s presented as a neutral public service announcement, but then it contains these rhetorical questions about the union that appear to be intended to scare people into sticking with the status quo,” Franta said.
In his email, Garber also indicated that the United Auto Workers set a base rate of 1.44 percent of salary for dues, which, for a Harvard teaching fellow who receives $21,200 per year, would amount to $305 annually.
He concluded his email by urging eligible students to “cast an informed vote,” writing that student union elections often see low voter turnout.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senior forward Rachel Garcia’s last regular season game was definitely one to remember.
Heading into its potential final game of the season Saturday against Columbia, the Harvard women’s soccer team held a one-point lead over the Lions in the race for the Ivy League title.
With a golden goal in the second overtime period, Garcia made sure not to let that lead slip away. The senior’s game-winner helped the Crimson hold on and secure its third title in the past four years.
After failing to register a goal on five shots in the first overtime period, Harvard only needed 75 seconds to score in double overtime.
In the second overtime frame, senior forward Joan Fleischman collected the ball and beat a defender as she dribbled down the left wing. She then played a cross into the box, where Garcia was able to collect it and fire a shot past Lions goalkeeper Allison Spencer, giving the Crimson a 2-1 victory on Senior Day.
Garcia’s performance, which also included an assist to senior forward Midge Purce seven minutes into the contest, earned her Ivy League Player of the Week honors. This was Garcia’s third time claiming the award this season, and the second time she has done so in the past three weeks.
Garcia’s stronghold on the Player of the Week award over the past few weeks highlights her strong second half to the season.
Following a first half where she posted two goals and an assist, Garcia notched four goals and four assists in the final eight games of the season. Her performances over this stretch were crucial, as Harvard went undefeated over the course of its final eight games.
“Rachel has been outstanding for us this year, especially at the tail end of the season,” Harvard coach Chris Hamblin said. “She’s really grown and come into her own and become that player for us. She finds ways to score goals and create chances for other people.”
Overall, Garcia ended her regular season with six goals and five assists. Her 17 points ranked second on the team to classmate Midge Purce and fifth in the Ivy League. The Duluth, Georgia, native enjoyed her best season in her second and final year with the team, as she posted Harvard highs in goals, assists, points, and shooting percentage.
Garcia came to the Crimson after spending two years at the University of Georgia. During her time with the Bulldogs, she recorded eight goals and 11 assists. In her freshman year, she was named to Top-Drawer’s list of top 100 freshmen in the nation. Then in her sophomore year, Garcia showcased her ability to perform in clutch moments, as her two game-winning goals tied for second most on the team.
In her first season with Harvard, Garcia posted three goals and two assists in 17 appearances, 13 starts, for the team. She also chipped in two game-winners, and her efforts earned her an All Ivy-League honorable mention. That year, the Crimson finished second in the Ivy League behind Princeton.
Following the graduation of several key seniors, the Crimson turned to a core group of Garcia, co-captain Bailey Gary, Purce, goalkeeper Lizzie Durack, and forward Joan Fleischman in hopes of claiming its third conference title in four years.
And that’s exactly what they did. As a result of Garcia’s heroics Saturday, the team moves on to face Rutgers (11-4-6) on Saturday in the first round of the NCAA tournament. Rutgers comes into the matchup having lost 2-1 to No. 8 Minnesota on Saturday, but remains a formidable opponent.
Furthermore, every game from here on out will be do-or-die for the Crimson and its most veteran class, as the NCAA tournament follows a single-game elimination format.
“It’s been a fun season,” Garcia said. “We had eight seniors this year, so we were all really going for it. I thought all the seniors this year did an awesome job being leaders and also on the field.”
“I learned that the team is much more than a group of individuals,” Hamblin said. “They believed in each other, they believed in themselves, and they were able to take risks, deal with adversity, and put themselves in challenges that were really outside their comfort zone.
“I’m just so proud of them that they were able to get the reward they deserved.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Columbia has somehow managed to win two football games this season without scoring a touchdown in either one. Freshman kicker Oren Milstein singlehandedly outscored Wagner and Dartmouth with field goals in two low-scoring affairs.
But on Saturday at Harvard Stadium, Columbia staked itself to a 14-7 lead heading into halftime, bolstered by a five-yard touchdown pass to freshman wide receiver Ronald Smith and a defensive score off a blocked punt.
The Lions’ early touchdown-fueled lead was ominous based on its 2016 track record, and sure enough Columbia continued its trend of losing high-scoring games. After a slow start, Harvard steamrolled its way through the third quarter to secure a 28-21 win.
THIRD TIME’S THE CHARM
At the end of the second quarter, senior quarterback Joe Viviano went under center at the goal line, a rarity in coach Tim Murphy’s system, and was sacked on fourth down. The Crimson trailed, 14-7, at the half, only its second halftime deficit of the season.
“We obviously didn’t play great offensively, defensively, or special teams in the first half,” Murphy said. “We talked it over at halftime… and came out and really did a good job with poise, confidence, and execution.”
The third quarter was ultimately the turning point in the game, and the beginning of the second half was marked by a wild sequence of events. On the kickoff, Lions returner Josh Wainwright fumbled and lost possession, only for Harvard to see a prime opportunity ripped out of its hands when Viviano was intercepted on the goal line.
On the ensuing drive, Columbia quarterback Anders Hill fumbled, and sophomore defensive tackle Scott Garrison recovered to give the Crimson another scoring chance. This time, Harvard capitalized with a touchdown from sophomore running back Charlie Booker. Two Columbia possessions later, Hill lost the ball again, and Harvard added seven more points.
All told, the Crimson tallied 21 points in the third quarter to overcome the Lions’ early lead.
A LIONIZED DEFENSE
Entering Saturday’s game, Columbia’s calling card was its defense.
In seven prior games, the Lions had surrendered 164 points, an average of 23.4 per game. This output appears mediocre at best, but it is skewed by a pair of blowouts against Penn and Princeton, two of the Ivy League’s top three offenses. In its three nonconference games and its 9-7 win over Dartmouth, Columbia conceded only 50 total points.
“We’ve played really well defensively for the majority of the game, and then sooner or later I think you get a little bit tired out,” Lions coach Al Bagnoli said. “But honestly if you just look at all of the high-powered offenses early, we’ve done a pretty nice job of bottling them up.”
Though the Crimson came up with a final tally of 28 points, Columbia’s ball security was really to blame. If Harvard had not been allowed to capitalize on three critical third-quarter turnovers, the Crimson would have been hard-pressed to put so many points on the board.
“We’ve got to make sure that, if nothing else, we value and possess the football,” Bagnoli said. “I think in that area we need a dramatic improvement. It put us in very dire straits today against a very good team.”
The dominance of the Lions’ defense shone through on Harvard’s first few possessions. Viviano struggled to hit his targets, and he made no progress running the ball himself. The Berwyn, Pennsylvania, native finished the contest with a paltry six yards rushing on 19 attempts.
Columbia forced Harvard to send junior punter Zach Schmid onto the field a staggering 11 times, the most punt attempts in a game for the Crimson this season. Lions linebacker Michael Murphy blocked a punt in the second quarter, allowing fellow freshman Hunter Lunsford to scoop the ball up and head to the end zone for a defensive score.
SCOTT-FREE
While a 109-yard shot may be trivial for PGA Tour golfer Adam Scott, 109 yards marks a remarkable performance for sophomore wide receiver Adam Scott.
The Denton, Texas, native racked up that yardage on only seven catches, and he added two touchdowns and a crucial catch that set up another score.
Scott was the key to Harvard’s offense on Saturday, and his two scores illustrate the dynamic effect he can have on the Crimson offense.
On one hand, he excels at exploding off the line to beat cornerbacks. In the first quarter, he put Harvard on top by outstripping his defender to the end zone and grabbing a perfectly-placed Viviano pass.
But catching the deep ball is not the only facet of Scott’s game. In the third quarter, he extended Harvard’s lead by catching a short screen pass out to the right and weaving his way down the sideline for six points.
Columbia’s secondary was a real threat in the early going, but Scott burned the opposing defensive backs several times in key spots.
“We knew going in we were going to have to make big plays in order to win,” Scott said. “I studied the film and made sure I knew exactly how to get off the line.”

While our mental calendars may be counting down to Harvard-Yale (less than two weeks!), it is impossible to forget that The Game marks the beginning of one of the best weeks of fall semester - Thanksgiving Week. Even though Yale gets its revenge on Harvard each year by not having classes the entire week, we’re still #blessed to have a two-day week, and many professors cancel lectures and sections due to low student turnout. For those students not headed home for the holiday, Flyby is here to help you make some last-minute plans with your roommate/bestie/anyone that will take you in or is in the same position.
Schmooze the RoommateIf you didn’t make time to play nice with the visiting parents and siblings over Freshman Parents Weekend, it’s time to win over your roommate (even if you loathe them at this point in the semester.) Pick up your dirty laundry, buy some nice cheese and crackers for the common room, and maybe even make your bed for the first time since Freshman Week. Start feigning some curiosity about what life is like in the suburbs of Boston and use your hallway kitchen to practice baking your favorite pie. A delicate lattice is sure to win over your roommate’s parents!
New York CityRally the troops (troops = all your fellow Thanksgiving non-travelers), hop on the Megabus (or Amtrak if you’re feeling fancy), and lose yourself in the concrete jungle. Be sure you’re there for Thursday so you can wake up at 3am and catch the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade in-person. Nothing like massive Snoopy and Spongebob balloons and an appearance by Santa Claus to brighten your chilly morning. Make sure once you consume your body weight in Pillsbury Crescents and mashed potatoes, you hit up one of the city’s parties to dance off your newly discovered fat rolls.
Thanksgiving on CampusYour dinner doesn’t need a 30-pound turkey or all the fixings, but take some time after Harvard-Yale (fun fact, did you know that Yale students call it “Yale-Harvard” … hah!) to hop out of the pressure-cooker that is Harvard’s campus and head to a local grocery store before the old lady down the street grabs the last box of instant stuffing off the shelf. Go for an easy bird to tame like a chicken roaster from Whole Foods, or skip the meat all together and just go for your favorite dishes like cranberry mold and pumpkin pie. If all else fails, you’ll still have your $3 bottles of wine from Trader Joe’s.
