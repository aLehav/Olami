After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Spee Club has canceled a party planned for Saturday night after an invitation to the event drew criticism from students and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana.
On Thursday, the Spee apologized for circulating the invitation, which included an image titled “Playbear” and linked to a YouTube video, which has since been removed and featured clips of women wearing underwear. The apology followed pushback from some students who argued that its depiction of women was sexist.
“In light of recent events, we have decided to cancel tonight's party,” Vince T. Cooper ’15 wrote in an email to original recipients of the invitation on Saturday afternoon. “We will pause to reflect on the issues at hand, and we look forward to welcoming you all back soon.”
On Friday, Khurana characterized the invitation as “offensive, crude, and sexist” in an email to students.
“I am troubled by the lack of judgment shown in organizing and promoting this event, which runs counter to the values we hold as a community,” he wrote.
Cooper did not respond to requests for comment over phone and email.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Riding three unanswered first-line goals in the first period, the No. 19/- Harvard men’s ice hockey team held on for the series sweep on Saturday night, beating Brown, 4-3, in Game 2 of opening round ECAC tournament play at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
First period strikes from each of the Crimson’s (17-11-3, 11-8-3 ECAC) top line forwards and an early second period score from second-line forward Colin Blackwell built the hosts an early three-goal lead that withstood a late Bears (8-20-3, 5-14-3) surge and clinched the hosts’ first postseason series win in three years.
“[The win] feels great,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “Brown deserves a lot of credit. They stayed with it and kept it very interesting at the end.”
In the game’s final seconds, Brown captain Matt Lorito had one final opportunity at the right side of the Crimson net to extend his storied career, but fourth-year goaltender Steve Michalek’s pad took away an opening at the post as time expired.
Harvard will now play out the rest of its season on the road, starting with Game 1 of a best-of-three quarterfinals series against Yale in New Haven on Friday.
“I think we’re kind of getting back to our peak form,” said junior forward Jimmy Vesey, who finished the game with a goal and two assists. “We couldn’t be happier going to Yale.”
After surrendering the first four goals of the contest on Friday, the Bears got on the board first on Saturday. After Brown junior Mark Naclerio beat junior Crimson co-captain Kyle Criscuolo cleanly on a faceoff in the attacking zone, classmate Nick Lappin beat Michalek (24 saves) from the slot to give the visitors an early lead.
But the Bears’ advantage would not last long, as junior forward Jimmy Vesey found an answer just over five minutes later. Criscuolo forced a turnover behind the Brown net and cycled the puck to Vesey, who skated between the faceoff dots before launching a wrist shot that found the netting.
The goal sparked a period to remember for the Crimson first line, which was without the services of sophomore forward Alex Kerfoot, who suffered an upper body injury in Game 1.
Midway through the period, Criscuolo, whom Donato moved to Kerfoot’s position at center, followed up his assist with a goal of his own, picking the top corner of the net from his forehand to beat the glove of sophomore Bear goaltender Tim Ernst. Then at the 17:52 mark of the frame, the newest member of the top line struck, as junior right wing Brian Hart caught Ernst looking the wrong way on a wraparound attempt to double the lead.
With a secondary assist on Hart’s goal, Vesey became the first Harvard player since Dominic Moore ’03 to score 50 points in a season.
“This weekend I think we were firing on all cylinders,” Vesey said. “Hopefully we can keep that going.”
After the intermission, the Crimson offense kept rolling. Following up a two-goal performance in Game 1, Blackwell sent a wrister in the high slot past Ernst to extend the lead to 4-1. The fourth-year forward made his return to the ice on the final weekend of the regular season after missing the majority of the last two years due to concussion-related symptoms.
But unlike Friday when Harvard’s 4-1 lead eventually became 6-1, Brown fought its way back. Bear sophomore Davey Middleton, who left the ice after taking a hit to the head from second-year center Sean Malone midway through the first period, returned in a big way in the second, punching home a second-chance opportunity near the crease. A period later, the Bears cut the gap to one on Lappin’s second score of the night at 11:07.
“We’re not fully ecstatic with the way we finished the game,” Donato said. “We stopped skating a little bit. I thought we made some safe plays, but there were better plays as far as just playing the game.”
Nonetheless, Donato’s squad held its own in the final eight minutes of play to seal the game and the series. With a trip to Lake Placid on the line, Harvard will now prepare for a Yale opponent that has dominated the teams’ rivalry as of late.
“We’ll have our work cut out for us, but we’re excited about the challenge,” Donato said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 8, 2015, at 12:10 a.m.
Just before 9 p.m. on Saturday evening, the Harvard men’s basketball team witnessed the most important play of its season unfold.
And it happened in an arena 130 miles away.
In a wild 13 seconds of action in Hanover, N.H., Dartmouth climbed back from a three-point deficit, knocking down a three and connecting on a last-moment layup to defeat Yale, giving Harvard a share of the Ivy League crown and keeping the Crimson’s NCAA Tournament hopes alive in the process.
If Yale (22-9, 11-3 Ivy) had beaten the Big Green (14-14, 7-7), it would have clinched its first March Madness berth since 1962. But the combination of the Crimson’s own 72-62 win over Brown on and the Bulldogs loss means Harvard and Yale will face off in a playoff game at the Palestra next Saturday to determine who will be competing in the Big Dance.
As the final moments of the matchup in Hanover expired, the Crimson players remained on the sideline of Lavietes Pavilion, circled around a computer that was live-streaming the contest—and the group let out a unified roar as Dartmouth’s game-winning shot went through the hoop.
For Harvard’s title hopes, however, Saturday’s matchup in Lavietes was just as important as the one in New Hampshire.
Behind a 28-13 run to begin the second half, the Crimson did what it was unable to do when it took on Yale Friday night—knock down a series of three-pointers, enabling it to come from behind, take the lead, and, ultimately, blow out the Bears (13-18, 4-10), outscoring the visitors by 11 in the second half.
“What can you say—we’ve talked about how [crazy] our league is,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “Certainly we’re thrilled to call ourselves Ivy champs for [the fifth year] in a row. It’s an amazing accomplishment…and we’re very hopeful we’ll be ready to go for round three versus Yale.”
While Harvard (21-7, 11-3) was down one after the first period, an offensive outpouring from beyond the arc following intermission created the space it needed to walk off the hardwood with a comfortable victory.
After misfiring on every three-point attempt in the first 20 minutes of play, the Crimson saw junior co-captain Siyani Chambers and senior wing Wesley Saunders hit a trio of triples in the first 2:36 of the second half to give the team a two-point advantage.
From there, the lead kept building. Co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi had a breakaway layup, Saunders converted a put-back lay-in, and Chambers hit another trey before sophomore marksman Corbin Miller and senior forward Jonah Travis knocked down consecutive jumpers.
The highlight of the spurt came with just over 12 minutes to go, as Travis saved an errant Crimson shot from bouncing out of bounds by throwing a backwards pass into the paint—a pass that skipped in between a Brown defender’s legs before Miller hit a three moments later.
From there, Harvard coasted, going up by as many as 18 before the final whistle blew.
“There were a lot of emotions [tonight],” Saunders said. “We were talking on the bench a little bit about [the Yale matchup], but we were also just thinking that we wanted to finish this game the right way, stay locked in on our task, and worry about the other stuff later.”
With Saturday’s contest marking Harvard’s Senior Night, it was, appropriately, two of the Crimson’s veterans that kept it within striking distance in the first half.
Falling behind by seven in the early going, Harvard relied on the two-man game of Saunders and senior Kenyatta Smith to inch its way back into the contest.
The hot shooting of Brown’s junior forward Cedric Kuakumensah had enabled the team to control the tempo for much of the opening period; the Bears’ leading scorer hit three triples from the left wing in a matter of minutes, matching the entire Crimson squad in scoring through 7:26 of play with 11 apiece.
But a series of short corner jump shots from Harvard’s big men—Moundou-Missi and Travis—brought the Crimson back within one, 20-19. And on two of the next three possessions, Saunders found classmate Smith in the heart of the lane, with the latter scoring both times. The second of those buckets gave Harvard its first lead in almost 12 minutes, and marked Saunders’s fifth assist to Smith in the first 17 minutes of play.
On the night, the Bears were paced by Kuakumensah, who tallied a game-high 23 points in 38 minutes. Four players scored in double figures for Harvard, with Chambers leading the pack with 15 points and Saunders, Travis, and Smith notching 12 points apiece.
“[It was] just a really good team effort by our kids, especially coming off of last night,” Amaker said. “We use the phrase [‘regrouping and responding’] all the time…and I can’t imagine our teams have been able to do that any better than we did tonight.”
On Saturday, Harvard needed a little help from a conference rival to give its postseason hopes some life. But when it takes on Yale next weekend in an attempt to punch a ticket to its fourth consecutive NCAA Tournament, it’ll have to rely solely on its own means to come out on top.
And the Crimson can’t wait for that moment.
"To have an opportunity to play to be the ultimate representative in the NCAA Tournament next weekend—what an opportunity for our team," Amaker said. "[This] is a big lesson to just keep your head down and keep going, just keep going.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 7, 2015, at 8:00 p.m.
It is a rare occasion that a team gets to celebrate an overtime goal twice, but that is exactly what the Harvard women’s ice hockey team was able to do Saturday evening against Quinnipiac after the Crimson's overtime goal was held up following a lengthy review.
In a game that took more than the prescribed 60 minutes to play out, Harvard (24-5-3, 16-4-2 ECAC) sent the Bobcats (26-8-3, 15-5-2) packing in a 2-1 overtime thriller. With the win, the Crimson moves on to the ECAC Championship game against Cornell Sunday afternoon. The Big Red finished tied for fourth in the ECAC regular season, while Harvard entered the tournament as the second seed.
The Crimson had trailed for the majority of the contest and entered the third period down 1-0 to a Quinnipiac squad whose senior goalie Chelsea Laden had been a brick wall for the first 40 minutes of play.
It was senior defenseman Sarah Edney who struck first for Harvard at the 7:14 mark of the third period. Edney took a shot from the right wing that bounced off Bobcat defenseman Lindsey West in traffic and found the back of the net, tying the game at one.
The remainder of the third period was silent on both ends, with solid defense forcing the extra frame.
A controversial goal that was knocked in by junior forward Miye D’Oench at 2:39 in the overtime period was what put Harvard over the edge. It was unclear to the officials what had forced the puck into the net, but after a lengthy period of review, the call went in favor of the Crimson.
“[Co-captain Samantha] Reber took a nice low shot from what seemed like an unthreatening angle, but coach always says that all shots are good in OT,” D’Oench said. “I was up in front of the net working on one of their defenders, and [Laden] made the initial save but kind of lost the puck, and it went off of my chest and into the net.”
Prior to the goals, it took two periods for the Harvard sticks to warm up. Quinnipiac was able to break through first, as Bobcat forward Emma Woods found the back off Harvard’s net off a deflected puck that got past Crimson junior goalie Emerance Maschmeyer.
Coming into the game, Maschmeyer had the highest save percentage in the ECAC at .943, and she stayed true to her standard, saving the 30 of the 31 shots she saw between the posts.
Throughout the rest of the first period, Harvard took some promising shots on goal, all of which were saved by Laden.
“Both goaltenders played really well,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “They did their job, and they both gave their team an opportunity to win the game, and that’s exactly what they should do, so they were both up to the test.”
The fluid amount of offense that was seen in the first period was not mirrored in the second, as each team came out of the box and went straight into a period of stop and go hockey. The Harvard offense had problems getting shots on goal, struggling to get past the Quinnipiac line and into opposing territory. The few opportunities the team did have to generate shots on goal were once again stopped by Laden, who at times seemed to be everywhere at once in front of the net.
Looking on to Sunday’s game against Cornell, whom the Crimson has seen twice during the regular season, Stone believes there are still improvements that can be made to the team’s play.
“Today was a good hockey game, but I don’t think we played our best,” Stone said. “I’m impressed by our team’s strength and resilience, and I’m happy we’re playing in the final, but we all know we can play better than we did today. We can play better, harder, faster and smarter, and that’s what we expect out of our kids tomorrow.”
