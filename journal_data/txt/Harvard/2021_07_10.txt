Director Todd Haynes’ new film, “The Velvet Underground,” premiered on July 8 at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival. In the documentary, which highlights the ‘60s proto-punk and art rock band, Haynes creates a beautifully innovative film that is as much itself a piece of art as it is about art.
“The Velvet Underground” is avant-garde in the same way that the band was. Loud, unforgiving, heavily stylized, and unwaveringly captivating, the documentary and its subject both find their success in pushing the boundaries of what can be done in a medium. Just as Lou Reed, John Cale, Sterling Morrison, and Maureen Tucker toyed with the limits of sound, creating new tunings and chords to complement Reed’s poetic lyricism (and, as Cale says in the documentary, to impress other people), Haynes’ first documentary experiments with frames and spacing, refusing to be limited by the usual conventions of cinema. Rarely does Haynes fill the entire frame with one shot, but rather collages two, four, or even 16 at a time. When Haynes does choose to center just one image — whether it be an intimate interview with Lou Reed’s college roommates or footage from The Velvet Underground’s many shows at The Dom — he plays with the framing, light, and color scheme in a way that makes the film look as brilliant and enigmatic as The Velvet Underground themselves.
In breaking down the vast mythologies that surround the legendary band, the film brings about a necessary dissonance between The Velvet Underground that was Andy Warhol’s art project — which was subversive for what appeared to be the mere sake of subversion — and The Velvet Underground that was truly the result of the right people finding each other at the right time to create something that had never been heard before. More than just the expected celebration of the ‘60s, “The Velvet Underground” is an unyielding ode to the ways in which the era’s zeitgeist (which, the film’s subjects argue, is not sub- or counterculture, but simply the culture) opened the doors for the very possibility of The Velvet Underground’s existence. Haynes draws clear lines between the group and the countless cultural phenomena that made them possible, from the Beat poets, to Warhol and his incessant production of art and art subjects, to the intellectual lyricism of Bob Dylan, to the very New York anti-hippieism that allowed the band to gain popularity on their signature cocktail of dark, destructive lyrics and dissonant drone riffs.
When the film breaks from being a love letter to the ‘60s punk rockers, it is because it falls into the cult of Lou Reed, pulled into its magnetism. In one scene, one of Haynes’ interviewees says, “Boys and girls, men and women [all] fall in love with Lou.” WIth the film’s focus on Reed as an artist and the driving force behind The Velvet Underground, it seems that Haynes’ directorial eye fell in love with him too. Because Reed is so emblematic of The Velvet Underground mythos, and because he was such a genius, his absence in the film leads to a presence even greater than what it could have been otherwise. Haynes and his interviewees alike center their own individual and shared narratives around the blazing frontman. While such a focus on Reed could have proved a pitfall for a film dedicated to telling the story of the band as a whole, it provides instead the opportunity for Haynes to refocus Reed’s legacy — and thus the Velvet Underground’s legacy — through the eyes of his bandmates and contemporaries, rather than refracted through rumors.
In describing the usual progression of Velvet Underground shows where fans would wait silently for five seconds at the end of the opening song, Jonathan Richman, a superfan and the founder of rock band The Modern Lovers, said of the audience, “The Velvet Underground had hypnotized them one more time.” Haynes’ documentary, too — with its cacophonous soundtrack carved out of The Velvet Underground’s music, paired with vibrant, abstract imagery and avante-garde sensibilities — is hypnotizing.

As I write this at 3 a.m. with approximately three hours of sleep (thank you, 8 a.m. screenings!), I can’t help but think about the many ways that Cannes has been a dream so far. Sure, we’ve had our struggles — largely because having a yellow press badge means most of our time is spent waiting, either for premiere screenings or for those coveted celebrity interactions — and, of course, the massive sleep deprivation of the past two days is sure to only get worse (Joy is on her 85th cup of coffee for the trip, and I am only exaggerating a little bit). But we’ve also already had some truly life-changing opportunities!
I saw “Annette”’s Simon Helberg (famous for playing Howard Wolowitz in the “Big Bang Theory”) yesterday while exploring the rooms that my lowly yellow press badge can access at the Palais de Festivals. And while I didn’t say “hi,” or even make eye contact, really, I did secure bragging rights in the family group chat, and that’s enough.
That was in the morning. Joy and I spent the rest of the day in and out of screenings, frantically writing reviews in the meantime. We also spent the better part of our night scheming how we could get into the world premiere of the Matt Damon-starring drama “Stillwater” the following day. By “we,” I mean that I would pester Joy with countless different plans for how we could attend said screening, while she would politely smile and pretend that she wasn’t tired of hearing me obsess over any given celebrity for the upteenth time.
When we finally decided it was time to go back to our apartment, it was only around 10 p.m. and we were excited to write the rest of our reviews from home. “We’re so organized!” we told ourselves. “So on top of things!” But we were hit by the perfect storm.
I had multiple calls scheduled for the next hour, which meant Joy was left with the responsibility of navigating Cannes’ surprisingly confusing bus system all alone as we raced through the Croisette, desperate for our beds. The resulting chaos meant that we waited three hours last night for a bus that was never supposed to come, causing us to miss the buses we actually were supposed to take. (It was then that it finally made sense to me why our host, Joy’s own blockmate, gave me the keys to the apartment instead of Joy.)
In our late-night delirium, I felt compelled by some odd force to start singing a song from Leos Carax’s “Annette,” but since we had only just seen it yesterday, I only knew one lyric. I assured Joy this was the best way to get us to Mandelieu, as it would manifest an appearance from “Annette”’s Marion Cotillard, who could then give us a ride back. We soon learned that we had been looking at the map wrong the entire time, so with no show from Cotillard, we finally got onto a bus at 12 a.m. To everyone’s dismay, the “Annette” singing continued on my end (It was stuck in my head! I couldn't help it!) which inspired Joy to begin singing “Jesus Take the Wheel” as a coping mechanism. Much to her chagrin, the result was that I now associate that song with the “Annette” song, which, given how often Joy sings “Jesus Takes the Wheel,” is not good for anyone.
After arriving back at our Mandelieu apartment at around 1:30 a.m., I got to work on yet another review. When I came back to the room a few hours later, I found Joy passed out on the bed, fully clothed, with the lights on. Oh, Cannes, we love you so!
The misfires of yesterday meant that we were more than motivated to make today’s festival schedule the best it could be. And I’m now happy to report that we largely succeeded. The day’s screenings and review-writing went on as planned, but come late afternoon, we had changed out of our business casual garb into prom dresses, jumpsuits, and stilettos. We were ready to make our way, sans ticket, into the “Stillwater” premiere, even if that meant standing for hours outside in six-inch heels in the blistering French Riviera. Much to our surprise, we were successful!
Walking up the red carpeted steps of the Grand Théâtre Lumière, we saw the stars just a few steps below us. Wanting to immortalize the moment, we attempted to take pictures but were promptly reprimanded by festival staff. Even still, the relief we felt after days of wanting-in to these highly coveted black tie screenings was unmatched. Afterwards we met up with former Crimed extraordinaire, Caroline A. Tsai ‘20, who used her Cannes expertise to help us hatch a plan to catch former Harvard student Matt Damon’s attention as he left the theater. “We’re from Harvard, too! We live in Lowell House!” we yelled. The fact that only Joy lives in Lowell House and Caroline has graduated was irrelevant to us. Damon lived in Lowell, which meant we would say we did too. Despite our best efforts, however, Damon quickly rushed away from the throngs of fans that had similarly hoped to catch him at the exit, crushing our dreams of including a quote in this blog post.
But don’t worry, dear Crimson readers, we have bigger and better plans for the next time we chance a celebrity rendezvous. Stay tuned.

“I’ve lived a magical life, and captured quite a bit of it.” The camera pans to reveal an aging Val Kilmer, surrounded by his artwork, before the footage of dozens of his cassette tapes flood the screen — a life in film, captured by home videos, audition reels, and behind-the-scenes footage, all stitched together to capture the ephemera of the everyday. A story, as Kilmer called it, "about acting... truth, and illusion.”
The eponymous documentary, “Val,” which premiered on July 8 at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival, is a compelling statement on life, art, and the futility — as well as the compulsive human need — of capturing fleeting truths, of capturing moments that define who we are. At the heart of the film is Kilmer’s wish to squeeze and contort an entire life onto a screen, whether it be his own, or that of his late brother, Wesley, whom he admired. And while such a goal may be unattainable in practice (Kilmer himself said his footage was “incomplete”), directors and editors Ting Poo and Leo Scott certainly get close. Their film showcases the humanity behind Kilmer as an artist who dedicated his life to the study of people — a portrait that contrasts his reputation as a “hard to work with” actor. The result is a stunning, if indulgently hagiographic, look into Kilmer’s life as he saw it. “Val” is more of a personal essay than a biography, which is exactly why it works. There is an astounding sense of sincerity in a visual diary expertly carved from thousands of hours of Kilmer's personal footage, all laid out on screen.
Because production started after Kilmer recovered from throat cancer (where he lost his ability to speak clearly), the film is narrated by Val's son, Jack. Through a combination of his loved one's moving testimonies, the revival of original 16mm film from Kilmer’s youth, a collection of his movie scenes, and new footage shot for the documentary, Poo and Scott ensure that viewers are brought into the Kilmer mythology as though it were absolute truth.
It is in bridging the divide between Kilmer’s side of his own story with the viewers' existing pre-conceptions that the editor-director duo strike the perfect balance between shameless tribute and something deeper. Scott and Poo don’t attempt to argue with Kilmer’s perspective, nor do they feign the type of superficial, boring objectivity that often drags biographies down with it. Instead, they lean into them while providing the audience with heart-rending vignettes of Kilmer’s ambition. It's an impression of naive fragility that's woven into small details like footage of Kilmer reading the same line about death in “Hamlet” four times over, or of the time-consuming audition videos he made for directors he wanted to work with (an especially elaborate video Kilmer made to audition for Martin Scorsese’s “Taxi Driver” stands out).
Kilmer’s reputation as an infamously misunderstood artist also brings a startling sense of intimacy. For instance, "Val" is unafraid to show Kilmer’s self-defined weaknesses, like having to “sell his old self” to fans in order to pay his debts. Again, it's the film's stylistic collage of home videos and present-day footage that pulls viewers into Kilmer’s world and helps them understand the actor’s most controversial decisions. For instance, decisions like leaving the “Batman Forever” franchise are justified by giving us an inside look into Kilmer's complex motivations, all driven by a need for artistic excellence. The only fault in the film’s secondary mission to redeem Kilmer’s image is that it doesn’t accept Kilmer’s own voice as enough for that redemption, and instead overcompensates with cheesy testimonies from contemporaries like Robert Downey, Jr., which can feel forced and awkward.
By focusing intently on his career — all the way from elementary school plays to "Citizen Twain" — “Val” draws compelling parallels between Kilmer and the many characters he played, comparisons that take us closer to understanding the enigmatic actor. For instance, by interlacing footage of Kilmer's performance as Jim Morrison in 1991’s “The Doors” with voiceover from Kilmer claiming that the Lizard King’s “aspiration [was] to capture [a] fleeting, ethereal truth,” viewers are led to believe that Kilmer aspires for much of the same. Perhaps that goal is also true for the filmmakers' behind "Val," who try — with an unflinching commitment — to depict Kilmer on screen as he sees himself.

Anne Frank’s story is hardly an obscure one, but never has it been reimagined quite like "Where is Anne Frank?" — an animated film by Israeli director Ari Folman which premiered on July 10 at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival.
Folman's film traces the Frank family through their lives in a secret annex in Amsterdam, hiding from Nazi occupation. What’s new in "Where is Anne Frank" is that it's seen through the eyes of Kitty, Anne's (Emily Carey) imaginary friend. After an explosive storm rocks the Anne Frank Museum “one year from now,” Anne’s diary is soaked, and Kitty (Ruby Stokes) comes to life, emerging from the pages. In the film, she serves to connect Anne to the contemporary world as the film draws parallels between the Frank family’s situation and that of Amsterdam’s refugee and immigrant populations today. As the near-future Amsterdam police — or non-German police, as Kitty calls them — arrest or otherwise mistreat refugees of color, Kitty is there to connect the dots.
Already benefiting from a storyline that is both accessible and engaging, gorgeous 2D animation paired with an original score composed by Sonic Youth’s Karen O makes the film a reimagining that is well worth the watch, especially for younger audiences. Folman’s expertise working with animation — as he has done in past films, like “Waltz with Bashir” (2008) — adds an extra dimension to the film. The heavily stylized scenes allow Folman to lean heavily on metaphor to color the story: Rather than depicting the Nazis as people, for example, the film opts for skull-faced figures with dark eyes and dark robes, towering over the rest. At another point, surreal animation allows audiences to experience the various (outlandish) fantasies Anne would have about freedom — fantasies as spectacular as a three story-flood in Amsterdam, or a war waged by Hollywood superstars against the Nazi army — as though they were really happening.
Still, “Where is Anne Frank?” has room to grow in its depictions of the very immigrant communities and communities of color it’s trying to advocate for. Yes, Folman’s story does work diligently to draw necessary parallels between Jewish people during the Nazi regime and refugees of color living in the modern day. However, many of the characters of color, specifically in the film’s introduction, are shown in a less-than-favorable light. For instance, Kitty’s eventual friend Peter (Sebastian Croft) is initially depicted as nothing more than a thief at the Anne Frank House, and he faces constant run-ins with the law throughout the film.
As Kitty quickly discovers, present-day society has commodified and exploited Anne Frank's story almost beyond recognition — using her name and likeness as the selling point on everything from bridges to theaters to schools. Folman is acutely aware that society has abstracted and objectified Frank's story beyond recognition — and often for their own ends. But Folman doesn't stop there; he also makes the compelling argument that it is precisely for these reasons that "Where is Anne Frank?" needed to be made now. At its core, the film is a compelling, if vastly oversimplified, reimagining of a timeless legacy in an undeniably timely context.

In Palme d’Or contender “Lingui,” the acclaimed Mahamat-Saleh Haroun tells a compelling story of unwanted pregnancy and abortion access in his home country, Chad. The film follows young single mother Amina (Achouackh Abakar) whose only daughter Maria (Rihane Khalil Alio) becomes pregnant at 15. Amina herself gave birth to Maria at a young age, raised her without a father, and suffered significant shame and social ostracization for her early pregnancy. Knowing her now-pregnant child might meet the same fate, she must decide whether to risk her religion and safety to help Maria get an illegal abortion.
Abakar brings a compelling youth, playfulness and rebellious streak to the outwardly-dutiful young mother. That duality is splashed on screen when Amina dances; in an early (pre-pregnancy) scene, the audience sees her joy as she moves her hips to a beat with carefree abandon. Later on, Amina dances to cheer up her daughter, playing the same music from the first scene in a hidden back courtyard behind their house. Amina has long sought release from a belief system where women cannot make decisions about their own bodies, but in the second scene where she dances to the song with her-now pregnant daughter, Abakar masterfully gives the dance a new urgency — Amina must take forceful ownership of her own body not only for her future, but for Maria’s.
In contrast, the young Alio is given a very difficult role, and her performance can feel one-note at times. She plays Maria as a girl with a mask of repressed anger, desperate to shut herself off from the outside world. We don’t see much of the emotion buried beneath that mask, save in a few moments when her anger bubbles over to her mother or her friends.
Though we do not see much variation from Alio, it's refreshing that Haroun does not shy away from allowing Maria to be angry. She expresses the pain she feels in ugly, messy, uncomfortable ways, and is still met with rightful sympathy and understanding. There is no forgiveness for her attacker, nor is she reduced to a passive puddle of tears. She and her mother find strength and dignity in revenge in a partner-in-crime type moment of catharsis.
Another of “Lingui”’s strong suits is its portrayal of trauma. For much of the film, Haroun doesn't disclose exactly how Maria became pregnant — and doesn't treat the circumstances as a prerequisite that somehow justifies her desire for an abortion. Suggestions that sexual violence were involved are subtle: Maria recoils from physical touch of any kind, responding with a frequent “don’t touch me” when her mother comes too close. Instead of a gratuitous scene of violence, the film thoughtfully recognizes the hyper-vigilance that often comes with sexual trauma — where any touch, even the most familiar, can feel like an invasion.
Despite its sensitive portrayal of pregnancy, abortion, and sexual trauma, the film’s greatest weakness is that it largely fails to define its characters outside of those themes. Aside from Amina’s love of dancing (a refreshing humanization), the film’s women have no real interests or personality traits outside of being or having been pregnant. The problem is not a lack of nuance on the acting side, but more that Haroun — who, with “Lingui,” is making his first film in a 30-year career with a female lead — fails to create opportunities for his characters to have deeper, more nuanced personalities. There are almost no side plots or non-abortion-related conversations that could have provided richer character development. For instance, after Amina makes her decision on the abortion, the remainder of the film is primarily a matter of waiting for that central event to unfold — with few significant occurrences in between.
As a compelling portrait of the consequences of outlawing abortion, and a touching mother-daughter story, “Lingui” is well-executed with an important message — especially for those who don’t already agree with the film’s pro-choice premise. On the other hand, many audience members don’t need to be convinced that a 15-year-old survivor should be able to get an abortion. And without that justification, it’s disappointing to watch yet another young girl be reduced to little more than a victim of male violence.

Though many try, few films succeed in capturing genuinely moving depictions of young womanhood. In a global film industry still overwhelmingly run by men, fewer still can be singled out for the genuineness of the female relationships they depict on screen. Luàna Bajrami’s directorial debut, “Luaneshat E Kodrës,” or, “The Hill Where Lionesses Roar,” is among those select few. The film premiered at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival as part of the Director’s Fortnight series, and was directed by Bajrami (who previously appeared in the 2019 Cannes film, “Portrait of a Lady on Fire”) when she was only 18. The Kosovo-born French actress and director also wrote the screenplay.
A refreshing — and, at times, breathless — depiction of freedom, femininity, and the pain of stagnation, the film follows three young women — Jeta (Urate Shabani), Li (Era Balaj), and Qe (Flaka Latifi) — coming of age as they struggle to cope with the reality of living in a town where, according to Qe, all they can do is “wait.” With far-fetched dreams of attending university in a town where most women work service jobs or stay at home (at a family gathering, Qe’s relatives talk about how she would make a suitable tea waitress), the three women hatch an outlandish plan to secure the freedom they so desperately crave. In the process, they meet a young student from France (Bajrami) who inspires their journey.
While a quest for freedom — and freedom from teenage ennui, specifically — is not the least bit unheard of in coming-of-age films, Bajrami’s take on the theme extends far beyond the typical indie sleeper hit. She carves compelling contradictions out of a story that is often told in the most superficial of modes — small town friends crave opportunity, but not for any apparent reason other than hunger for an opaque sense of “freedom.” The “lionesses” in this film are different. Their central desire is not simply to live in a city or to escape their families (however fraught, dysfunctional, and even dangerous their home lives prove to be), but to find the freedom they need to be more than they are allowed to be.
The film, in turn, is about freedom from womanhood when womanhood means that people don’t give women a second thought. The foil that Bajrami makes of herself with Lena expertly sets up this struggle between a life weighed down with seemingly endless opportunities, like Lena’s, and a life robbed of the very opportunity to choose a future, like that of the lionesses. In both scenarios, Bajrami makes the argument that the restlessness of the women stems in part from the expected ennui of young adulthood (an ennui no doubt aggravated for the lionesses) but also from the futility of believing any choice will save the women from the ways in which their womanhood will be dismissed and exploited. Just as Jeta and Qe, for example, are shown to suffer under an outwardly oppressive patriarchy, so too will they continue unless they avoid making any choice for their future at all, and simply disappear. Bajrami seems to argue by the film’s whirlwind ending that this reality will not change for any of the four women.
Bajrami’s attention to detail and representation are exquisite; the female gaze is evident in how she establishes the complex and growing relationships between Qe, Li, and Jeta through intimate closeups of touch and subtle glances. And the film’s pacing — from the slow crawl of its exposition to a rapidly entropic ending, much like the frantic rhythm of young adulthood — is intoxicating to the point of euphoria. Judging from “The Hill Where Lionesses Roar,” it’s clear that Bajrami’s career as an unapologetic artist will only grow from here.

What does Julie really want out of life? That, it seems, is the unanswerable question of “The Worst Person in the World,” a Norwegian film about a woman who chases domineering men because she’s afraid to face her own desires and choices. Director Joachim Trier burrows deeply into the psyche of Julie (Renate Reinsve), creating a hyper-focused, if narrow, work of intricate technical beauty.
One of the greatest of these technical strengths is the film’s score, composed by Ola Fløttum, which forms the perfect extension and exaggeration of each new turn in Julie’s vicious cycle. At the beginning of the film, when Julie is in her beloved honeymoon phase, the music sounds like something that would play in the background of a dimly-lit Italian restaurant, further adding a layer of glitz to a sugary montage of their happy moments. The kitsch and sentimentality of the combination of music and anniversary video-style cuts of romantic moments set the tone for the rest of the film — yet again, Julie has jumped into the fantasy and romanticization of a new relationship immediately after leaving an old one whose sheen wore off. That added layer of almost-sarcastic drama is present in the score in other moments, too. Swelling, romantic violins play when she kisses yet another ill-advised lover for the first time; audiences hear dissonant chords resolving into major keys, then returning to dissonance again as she wrestles with herself on a late-night walk home.
As the score delightfully mocks her romanticization of new love, Trier’s framing choices highlight a similar theme — her infatuation with other people’s lives as a substitute for her own. In an early scene where Julie and her boyfriend Aksel (Anders Danielsen Lie) go on vacation with his friends and their families, each set of couples stays in a glass-walled house, and the camera loves to peer in from the outside. After Julie and Aksel have a fight because she doesn’t want kids, the camera sees a cheerful family with several young children sitting down for dinner through the window. In another, we see a couple from across a field whose fight Julie heard through the walls the night before, as they stand on the docks and attempt to reconcile. The camera — and Julie, who is at the edges of the frame in each scene — watches all of them with longing and fascination. She does not want the kids, nor to be the at-odds couple determined to fight for their relationship; she wants their sense of knowing, their clear understanding of the life they want. These early shots of faraway people obscured by distance or glass windows hint beautifully at what’s to come, striking that rare balance between subtlety and clarity.
In perhaps the most obvious of the film’s visual metaphors, we see the same idea expressed in the reverse. Trier often suggests that Julie only feels a sense of control or satisfaction with herself when she is chasing the affection and reassurance of a man in the same way she unsuccessfully chased her absent father. And so in her darkest moment, when she hurts the person she loves in order to chase that feeling once again, everyone else around her is frozen in time as she runs toward her destination. It’s as if this is the only moment she can finally feel at peace with herself, not in a state of constant comparison or jealousy of the lives of everyone else. “The Worst Person in the World" shows, at every turn, a woman desperate to be outside of herself, and its visual metaphors are clever and beautiful, if increasingly unsubtle and repetitive as the film goes on.
Unfortunately, despite the film’s masterful technical elements, it has a tendency to layer artful metaphors for the same unresolved problem on top of each other, rather than pushing Julie to grow or face something new. Julie’s fundamental problem is explained in the film's first few minutes, by the first of many older, father-figure stand-ins she tries to earn love from. He tells her they need to break up because she doesn’t know who she is or what she wants. He worries they’ll fall into a perpetual, argumentative imbalance. Of course, this is exactly what happens with the rest of her relationships in the film: the same desire for male validation and lack of self-knowledge punctuating each repetitive argument.

“Real love hurts.” It shines its harsh light into your vulnerable crevices; it knows just when you’re at your weakest. It can survive any number of grievances, and it can destroy you in the process.
With certain loved ones, it’s hard to know what will remain when love and hurt are disentangled, or even find out how to do so in the first place. But that is the job Emmanuèle (Sophie Marceau) is tasked with in “Everything Went Fine” — to figure out what it means to love someone who can’t stop hurting you, and to learn to keep that pain from destroying you in the process.
Emmanuèle is the first at her 85-year-old father André’s (André Dussollier) bedside when a stroke leaves him paralyzed. She is almost impenetrably calm, urging him to eat, comforting him with steady reassurances he continues to shoot down. Finally, however, his favorite daughter breaks through, winning him over with a plastic-wrapped sandwich. She brings the other half of the sandwich home, placing it in the fridge with tender hope; her father is still in the hospital, but she was able to help — and that is all that matters.
Several hours later, André awakens to a choking fit in the ICU, coughing up the same sandwich and nearly choking to death. Emmanuèle puts the sandwich in the freezer; it won’t be needed for a while.
Then her father shares the film’s central revelation: André doesn’t want to fight the stroke, but rather he wants to die with dignity — and he needs her help. She snaps, storms out, goes to a bar, and throws out the sandwich. (The sandwich is just one of director François Ozon’s many uses of subtle, lyric symbolism, a visual metaphor that sticks with audiences without its meaning being so obvious as to be heavy-handed). Emmanuèle has spent her life withstanding her father’s mistakes and demands — “you can’t refuse my father anything,” she says several times throughout the movie — but this request will be the hardest of all. She will lose the respect she so prizes if she does not help him, and she will lose the father she loves if she does.
Unlike many of this year’s Palme d’Or contenders, “Everything Went Well” is not a call to action; it does not pose a question about the ethics of euthanasia. The audiences see André’s absolute certainty that ending life on his own terms is his only option, and also the devastation his decision wrecks on his vehemently-opposed family and friends. Rather than passing judgement on André’s decision, then, the film seems concerned merely with depicting it in utter emotional honesty, asking not whether it is ever justified, but how the family members left behind are to cope.
And Emmanuèle is, it turns out, more than up to the task. Though one of her first steps after her father makes his request is to tell her psychiatrist she’s unsure she’ll be “able to handle” assisting her father to die, it’s clear that she is a woman with a well of resilience much deeper than meets the eye. One part of that is the many ways she takes care of herself: preemptively upping her dosage of antidepressants, calling her beloved husband for help and accepting it when he gives it, taking a weekend vacation and break from hospital visits with a close friend. Just as she grounds her father and sister with a hand on their shoulder or a willingness to absorb their anger without personal offense, she too knows how to ground herself.
And that deep well of resilience is Emmanuèle’s greatest strength. She is thrown into relief against her mother, a woman who stayed with André “because I loved him, silly girl” — a line she answers no matter how miserable he made her. But guided by Ozon’s perfectly-paced growth and the core of self-protective resolve Marceau brings to the character, Emmanuèle does not let herself become devoured. It is deeply, wrenchingly clear that she loves her father, enough to overlook a lifetime of neglect, an inability to give a basic compliment without insulting her weight or intelligence, and a deep selfishness that devours everyone in its path. But there are certain lines she will not cross and, in a conclusion that could not be more satisfying, Ozon reminds audiences that salvation can come in the strength to let go.

“Ha’Berech”’s two leads aren’t supposed to color outside the lines. The first time they meet, they are dressed like perfect opposites — Y (Avshalom Pollak) in leather and black sunglasses, Yahalom (Nur Fibak) in a floral yellow sundress. Y’s eyes are obscured even further by the camera’s blur, while Yahalom’s are crisply focused and wide enough for the both of them. They fall into exaggerations of masculinity and femininity, respectively: He is quiet, reserved, rugged, dominating; she is ebullient, flirtatious, rambling, simple.
Israeli Director Nadav Lapid is a master of detail. Every small tick supports the boxes he has made for his two archetypes: Yahalom's shade of lipstick, Y’s ominously approving encouragements to “keep going” as she does most of the talking. Lapid also chooses to cut most scenes off just before their natural conclusion, never allowing for a fraction of a wasted moment or a touch of imperfection. Lapid also seems more fond of shooting each body part in isolation rather than the person as the whole, so the camera veers to Y’s shoes and Yahalom’s eyebrows. Each studied part is somehow more evocative than the whole, even when Lapid’s intentions seem more to be focused more on art than metaphor.
It’s to Pollak's credit that no matter how much his eyes and emotions are obscured, the audience always has a bearing on his feelings, which are expertly calibrated every time. Every glimpse of his nuanced, idiosyncratic expressions evades audience expectations for how a rugged, reserved character like Y (an ex-soldier and experimental filmmaker) would feel. Fibak, too, grows into her role of Yahalom — at first her performance is all empty smiles and exaggerated ebullience until she gradually shows us that her character knows more than she is letting on.
Lapid’s sharp eye paints a portrait of two different kinds of art lovers and ​​their relationship with an Israeli government that has begun a quiet, furious censorship campaign against many of its own artists. Yahalom, unlike her rural-born parents, is a bookworm who runs a state-controlled library where she oversees the screening of a controversial film directed by Y (who, in many ways, is a projection of Lapid). As Y’s film (and career) launches, it’s Yahalom’s job to get Y to sign an ominous state form promising to create material that adheres only to pre-approved “topics” — the diversity of the Jewish state, Zionism, etc — or give up on a future film career. Under Lapid’s ever-careful, unrelenting hand, the two are thrown into stark relief against each other.
Until, near the end of the film, they’re finally not. The sunglasses come off, once-walled off emotion blurring the opposites Lapid had so carefully constructed.
If a clean contrast were the end goal — misunderstood male auteur against docile state sycophant — “Ha’Berech” would merely have been a work of technical genius. But Lapid has calibrated his paragons of emotionless artistry and mindless subservience precisely so he can unravel them — so he can show in “Ha’Berech”’s final revelatory moments that Y and Yahalom are alike, too. And that no one, governor or citizen, art maker or art critic, leader or follower, is truly safe. The utter precision and rigidity of Y and Yahalom’s polar opposites makes the recognition of their common oppression feel earth-shattering, driving home the true stakes of Israel’s oppressive policies for even the most different of people.
In an interview with Deadline, Lapid explained just how alike he is to his character Y. “We took a decision not to apply [to the Israeli Film Fund],” he explained. “I wouldn’t say I was afraid someone would arrest me in the middle of the night, but I was worried that if the contents of the script would be revealed before it was shot, it would be easy to make the task almost impossible.” So Lapid shot the film in 18 days, on a small budget, with a script written in just two weeks. It’s all the more shocking then, that “Ha’Berech” achieves the heights of technical perfection it does — and all the more important that its message about the extent of the Israeli government’s artistic censorship be heard.
