After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge police made five arrests in a three-day span at the end of last week in response to three separate robberies, including one where the victim was allegedly held at gunpoint.
Out of the six individuals the authorities suspect to have been involved in the three alleged robberies, five were arrested within 24 hours of the incidents.
Police attributed the increase in street robberies to the weather, saying that as temperatures become warmer, more people go outside.
“This wasn’t because there was any great increase [in street robberies]. It was a seasonal uptick we predicted,” said Daniel M. Riviello, the spokesperson for the Cambridge Police Department. “We are pleased that officers were able to get there quickly and make the arrests.”
At 12:53 a.m. on June 16, Cambridge police arrested three men who they said were punching and kicking an individual at a bus stop on the corner of Green Street and Magazine Street. The victim, who was later taken to a hospital, told the officers that they had stolen more than $600 from his wallet after beating him, according to police.
Nkosi Newton, 28; Alexander Reynolds, 24; and Robert Bonds, 31, were arrested for unarmed robbery.
The next day, Cambridge police arrested Nathaniel Pellegrini, 21, in connection with an armed robbery. At 2:50 a.m., a Cambridge resident told police that two men approached him on Cardinal Medeiros Avenue between Cambridge Street and James Way. Putting a gun to his forehead, they allegedly stole his sneakers, backpack, cellphone, iPod, and $20 in cash, according to police.
At around 8 p.m. that day, police located and arrested Pellegrini at his home in Norwood, Mass., according to a statement issued by the police on Tuesday about the arrests.
The final arrest in the series came on June 18 following an alleged robbery in an alley near JFK Street at about 5 a.m. A police sergeant on her way to work spotted Timothy D. Gayhart, 24, who matched the description of the suspect. He tried to flee from police but was eventually arrested, according to a police statement.
Although these arrests were made over a short period, Cambridge has not experienced an increase in street robberies over the same time interval in past years.
Street robbery crimes decreased by 7 percent from 2009 to 2010 and have decreased by 3 percent from the past five-year average, according to the Cambridge Police Department’s 2010 Annual Crime Report.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Updated: June 23 at 1:50 p.m. | Rabbi Jonah C. Steinberg will serve as Harvard Hillel’s next executive director, the president of Hillel’s Undergraduate Steering Committee announced on Wednesday.
Steinberg, an associate dean at Hebrew College, was part of the founding faculty of the Rabbinical School of Hebrew College. Born and raised in Canada, Steinberg will take the position left by Bernard Steinberg, of no relation to Jonah Steinberg, who stepped down from the post last year.
"My aim is for Harvard Hillel to be on the personal maps of many different people in many meaningful ways, and on the map of the Harvard community and the wider world as an institution that showcases the Jewish tradition of daring to engage with the great issues and ideas of the day," he said in an email.
A committee composed of members of Hillel’s Board of Directors led the search for a new executive director following Bernard Steinberg’s announcement of his resignation last October. The committee and a firm that assisted in the search solicited input from Hillel’s membership and was able “to make a shidduch between us and Jonah” Steinberg, Arun A. Viswanath '13, the president of the Undergraduate Steering Committee, said in an email to Hillel’s undergraduate members.
“We should be proud of ourselves at this very exciting time,” Viswanath wrote. “We should also recognize that the next few years will play an important role in deciding the direction of Harvard Hillel.”
Jonah Steinberg graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Brown University and has since worked in various roles, ranging from an emergency room medical assistant in Israel to the leader of the Rabbinic Literature and Civilization program at Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in Wyncote, Pa.

This article was revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: June 23, 2011
An earlier version of the June 22 article "Jonah Steinberg Named Next Executive Director of Harvard Hillel" incorrectly stated that Steinberg was part of the founding faculty of Hebrew College. He is part of the founding faculty of the Rabbinical School of Hebrew College, he said in an email.
