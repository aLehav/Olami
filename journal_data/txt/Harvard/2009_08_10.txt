MALABO, Equatorial Guinea — This city won’t soon find itself on a postcard or illuminating the pages of an exotic travel guide. In fact, for the capital of an oil-rich nation, Malabo’s lack of even the most basic development is startling. 
Living here in the same conditions as the average citizen has been a struggle to say the least—with only a few hours of functioning electricity and questionable water flowing each day.  Though it is true that, like many other central African nations, Equatorial Guinea is struggling with infrastructure development, this country’s government has a wealth of oil-based profits flowing into its coffers that other such  nations do not. 
Contrasted with the very visible modern structures of President Teodoro Obiang’s government and family, the deplorable slums of Malabo are a visual hypocrisy staring everyone in the face. Tackling government corruption and greed in a developing context is admittedly a challenging task, but that is perhaps not even the real issue. Obiang could easily invest in bringing Malabo and the rest of the country’s infrastructure into the 21st (20th?) century and still have plenty of money left over to squander.
As I walk down these muddy streets filled with garbage, tangled power lines, and the roar of gasoline-powered generators, I wonder if Obiang himself has ever taken the same stroll and seen the same things. To keep these citizens living in conditions like this for perhaps no other reason than laziness or gross contempt is hardly indicative of a growing democracy.  
Last month the Human Rights Watch issued a report condemning the Equatorial Guinean government’s lack of transparency with respect to oil revenue. This was an important step towards keeping the average citizen’s struggles in the international eye, but as long as American oil companies remain the largest contributors to Equatorial Guinea’s income, it remains to be seen if any parties involved (especially the U.S.) can move beyond words and agreements towards concrete actions. 
And though oil revenue seems to be the key issue to address in Equatorial Guinea, it is really only a corollary to the true problem of weak democratic institutions. If the people of this country truly had the power of a voice through their votes, it would be much easier indeed for them to dictate how oil money should be spent. As such, there should be a strong push on both fronts—oil revenue transparency and building a real democracy—to bring the resources these citizens truly need to them as quickly as possible.

AHMEDABAD, India – In early September, the Indian Supreme Court is expected to rule on a gas-agreement dispute brought forth by India’s third richest industrialist, Anil Ambani—against India’s richest, Ambani’s own brother, Mukesh. The two businessmen now independently run what was once India’s largest industrial conglomerate, Reliance Industries, divided between the quarreling heirs after the death of the family and company patriarch, Dhirubhai Ambani. In a country ostensibly rooted in deep extended-family relations, the partitioning of Reliance and the Ambani family—the brothers now estranged—raises many questions as to the relevance of India’s cultural emphasis on family in a time of industrialization, when individual greed and ambition seem to increasingly trump former fraternal and filial obligations. 
The “joint-family home,” often comprising three generations’ worth of fathers, sons, brothers, male cousins, and respective wives and families, is now a fading heirloom of India, as speculative real estate investments and construction booms have led more and more families to forgo this ages-old tradition of living together, called “saath-saath” in Hindi. Likewise, the family business is no longer the only source of livelihood for sons, since alternative opportunities abound. But some attribute even this modern move away from the “family as necessitated for economic stability” mantra to the timeless strain in extended family relations as a whole. The Ambani’s are perhaps not unique in their recent disputes, but only in their press coverage.
In a country with almost a dozen Hindi words for “aunt” or “uncle,” depending on the exact relation, such a modern progression toward family breakdown and divide seems incongruous. But then again, partition in Indian history is a recurrent theme, referenced even in the Sanskrit epic “The Mahabharata,” where dividing the kingdom of Hastinapura among cousin, princely heirs is proposed as an alternative to war (although war inevitably ensues). In 1947, geographic partitioning of the subcontinent, intended to veil cultural-turned-political differences, later became the subtext for South Asia’s modern political narrative.
While these examples serve as “lessons to be learned from” antitheses to the idealized Indian family, they are not just mere aberrations. Bollywood and elders now romanticize a time of close-knit familial relations that seems impossibly forced, even for the olden times. The realities of family rifts are often rewritten in golden age retellings of the joint-family collective memory, or dismissed as the result of wayward relatives and brash younger generations. Surely Dhirubhai Ambani may be rolling over in his grave, but today’s evidence for familial breakdown is rooted in themes of family disputes that are as timeless as “The Mahabharata.” Quarrelling families are not a modern phenomenon in India, but the recent move away from the joint-family arrangement is arguably facilitated by more modern trends—India’s continuing growth and a booming real estate market. These factors are nonetheless coupled with desires for separation that have long existed in many joint families.
However, the cultural entrenching of familial respect does live on in its own modern formulation. Each year, countless Indian-Americans voyage back to the motherland in hopes of preserving the unity of families now separated by oceans. The state of “family” and its importance in India is thus seen in a new and modern light. For immigrants in general, relatives function as a symbol of stability in a foreign land. And undoubtedly, one maintains greater respect for those back home when seeing them requires 10,000 miles of travel. However, emigration, too, is a form of pre-emptive family partitioning, fought out in visas and green cards. And so it seems that—in a country with four times the population of the U.S. in one-third the area—all anyone really wants is space.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK, N.Y. — Every time I meet B, a rising high school senior in my writing class at Henry Street Settlement on the Lower East Side, he makes me laugh. He delivers his jokes with a screwball exuberance that puts him in the tradition of zany black comics Chris Tucker, Chris Rock, and Dave Chappelle. At first, I couldn't return the warmth, and glanced at him awkwardly as he offered his hand for—I didn't know what. Perhaps I felt more at home thinking about sentence structures than pounding and slapping hands with street-smart New York City students out in the physical world. After I bungled the handshakes, I always felt cold and distant. But I wanted to get to know B better. From the start, I admired his unselfconscious enthusiasm.
In one-on-one writing sessions, I learned that B loves to think about psychology. Though his humor appears effortless, it is really the product of constant analysis. He makes hypotheses about what kinds of laughs might be associated with particular brain states. He keeps a running list of what people say about the mind as he watches television. He finds food for thought even in exercise competitions. "Harness your psychic powers to enhance your muscles and annihilate your opponent!" he remembered an overexcited host saying. B wondered why the show would portray the mind as so dominant over the body.
B's conception of the psyche is more complicated. As a child, he gained a reputation for his skill at untangling knots of wires. He thinks of his mind as another knot in need of continuous untangling. He aspires to help others achieve mental order by becoming a psychologist. Already, he is working to make people healthier. As a peer sex educator employed by Henry Street, he journeys around New York City to give workshops on HIV/AIDS. He takes his job seriously. When I remarked that his workshops might save a life, he replied quickly: "Probably more." (His message, he said, would spread fast.)
Yesterday, I saw B and his coworkers across from my office, at the entrance to a complex of red brick housing projects, joking after a long day of work. I was wearing glasses, and couldn't see very well. But B called to me just as I walked outside. He had been slowly teaching me about greetings, and he extended a pound. I flubbed on the first try—maybe my mind was tangled. Then I asked B and one of his friends about handshakes. I had always felt that the pounders were somehow excluding me, and was sure that B and his friends knew a few gestures that marked off cliquish social groups. B told me that I was wrong. Yes, hand etiquette changes every few years, and there are some conventions. But what the greetings are really about is the attention that two friends pay to one another. The idea is to follow your friend's hand carefully as you approach it, making sure that you meet in the same way—shake, snap, slap, or pound. I learned from B that hand manners are like jazz.  They are not about exclusion—they are about sympathetic improvisation.

OSNABRÜCK, Germany — I started cooking last year after I moved off-campus to live with my boyfriend, who has an actual kitchen and uses it to make exactly three varieties of salad. When I decided that it was time for us to incorporate heat into our kitchen regimen, my mother saw it as a long-awaited opportunity to instruct me in Chinese cooking.
For months, she communicated recipes through phone calls, despite my insistence that none of them could be carried out without a real wok. My little sister visited me last spring and hauled along a suitcase of edibles, which included packets of dried herbs and berries prepared by my mother (and still sitting in my cabinet to this day). Shamefully, despite mastering made-from-scratch pasta sauce and somewhat authentic baklava, I had yet to prepare a proper Chinese meal when I left Boston this summer to spend a month at my boyfriend's home in Germany.
Once I arrived in his rather provincial hometown of Osnabrück, I subsisted largely on bread, cheese, and cold cuts. I had just visited my family the previous week, and after a few days abroad, my palate already yearned for a taste of home. So one evening, I volunteered to make honey-soy salmon and lettuce wraps for a party of seven, despite Osnabrück being the last place appropriate for my first foray into Asian-inspired cooking.
I say "inspired" because it seemed less than likely that I'd be able to procure all the ingredients necessary for a truly authentic Chinese meal. While Osnabrück boasts a significant Turkish population like many German cities, it isn't exactly what I'd call a diverse place. I've spent nearly two months here in the past year and have seen exactly three Asian people, all of whom worked in the single decent Chinese restaurant in town (a strangely upscale establishment compared to the ones I'm used to frequenting in America). So when I chose Chinese as the theme of the menu, I knew I was putting myself at a distinct disadvantage.
Despite the greater availability of organic produce in Germany, I was fairly certain that ingredients—such as the inaccurately named water chestnut (actually a kind of Chinese vegetable)—were not typical grocery-store fare. I did unexpectedly locate sesame oil in a kitchen cabinet, along with canola honey and expired soy sauce, but the rest of the ingredients had to be acquired elsewhere. My boyfriend, who claimed that an Asian market "definitely existed" in town, was less than helpful when asked for specifics, such as the physical address of said market. So instead, I scurried around the canned food section of an extremely sanitized store (already a bad sign for authenticity) and came away with canned bamboo shoots and baby corn, which would have appalled my mother, who never serves anything that has previously been sealed and shelved.
Due to some mistranslations and improvisation, my meal didn't turn out quite as planned, nor was it very authentic. The wraps actually ended up being more of a salad, because I couldn't explain to my German kitchen aide that the lettuce had to be cut into cups. Instead of jasmine rice, I had to make do with Uncle Ben's as an accompaniment to the salmon, a minor tragedy. But despite the comedy of errors that the dinner turned into, it was a success—if seven clean plates are any indication of culinary victory.
One of the guests inquired about the source of my recipe. "Is this the kind of food you ate at home while growing up?" she asked.
From my faint memories of childhood cuisine, I could recall leafy Chinese greens in oyster sauce, steamed fish flavored with ginger, and savory, sweet broths of whole chicken and berries, but my mother rarely made lettuce wraps, and never once prepared salmon.
I had to confess, "I found the recipe in a cookbook published by the BBC."
I suppose my two-course Chinese feast turned out not to be much of a feast, or particularly Chinese, for that matter. But I think my mother would have nonetheless been proud.

MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay — Clubbing in Uruguay seemed reminiscent of a sweaty, high-school basement rave.
I strolled in with my group and encountered other clusters of ragers, not sure if I’d know anyone or if the stereotypical cliques would want to know me. Leather-jacket goth types generally populated the bar, while trendsters rocked their flannel and high tops on the floor. 
As I timidly walked downstairs one night to the dance floor of Living, a cozy spot on the posher side of Montevideo, I began taking note of the club’s occupants. 
A skeletal little strumpet emerged from the bathroom, her nose freshly powdered. I looked around for something to toss her—a sandwich, croissant, jar of mayonnaise, anything really—but she stormed past me onto the floor and proceeded to pin another female against a gargantuan speaker. 
They began making out. Standard.
Nevertheless, a tiara-donning girl interrupted my view, throwing handfuls of confetti at my wandering face. Some of it went up my nose. That’ll be there awhile. Apparently she just graduated from high school. Huzzah. We stole a piece of the sheet cake her parents were casually guarding, guiltily offering a weak “congratulations.”
A miasma of fermenting B.O. hit my nostrils. 
Heads turned toward a dirty vagabond with a floppy mohawk. He plopped an equally dirty duffel on the dance floor; it was unclear whether this obstruction or his smell disrupted the place’s flow more. His pants didn’t reach high enough to fully cover personal parts, though a fuzzy pair of earmuffs adequately kept overexposure to a moderate low.
Quickly dubbed “Creeper” by the partying English-speakers, this loathsome creature would sneak up behind random individuals, laughing through a sinister grin. We tried dancing around in circles to avoid him. It was mildly successful.
Then the fuzzy earmuffs grazed my hand. 
Creeper had crossed the line. Well, my line at least. Everyone else didn’t seem to mind the sad little guy. I wondered aloud why no one had kicked his ass yet, or at the very least removed him. A few Uruguayos relayed his story. Creeper was on horse tranquilizers. But given his parents’ social status (famous psychiatrists…connection?), he and his bag were always welcome at Montevideo establishments.
That’s the problem with being a visitor, a tourist essentially. Observe all you want, but you might never understand. The fuzzy earmuffs are here to stay—but you’re not.

One of Tercentenary Theater’s elms fell last Saturday night and caused minor damage to Sever Hall.  The tree, which once stood between Sever Hall and Memorial Church, damaged Sever bricks, broke a window, and tore screens on its way down. Additionally, it knocked over a blue light police phone pole.
The incident resulted in no injuries, according to FAS Director of Communications Robert P. Mitchell. The University has yet to determine the incident’s cause, but suspects that “a number of natural factors contributed to the fall,” Mitchell said.
Harvard Operations contacted professionals as soon as possible following the fall, said Mitchell, and “work began on removal the very next morning.”  He added that the University is considering replacing the tree, but has yet to reach a decision. The exact age of the elm is unknown.
