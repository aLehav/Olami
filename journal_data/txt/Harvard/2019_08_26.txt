Rayna Yun Chou, a classically trained violist, is partnering with Celebrity Series of Boston to produce Concert for One, a series of minute-long concerts that bring together one musician and one listener for an intimate performance. The public program will take place Sept. 20 to 29 in the Harvard Science Center Plaza and Chin Park on the Rose Kennedy Greenway in Boston. Chou first staged Concert for One in Taichung City, Taiwan, in an effort to bridge the divide between classical musicians and everyday listeners, and the project attracted thousands of listeners.
The Harvard Crimson sat down with Chou to talk about the program, her own music practice, and the future of classical music.
The Harvard Crimson: What inspired you to do Concert for One?
Rayna Yun Chou: It came from a quote, actually. Three years ago, I was at the New England Conservatory, and my viola professor Martha Katz shared a quote with us that became the inspiration for and the beginning of everything. The quote was, “Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak. Courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen.” I realized that we never see a music performance that way. When we go to a concert, whether to perform or to listen, we think about ourselves: how nervous we are as musicians, or what our expectations are as listeners. I went home that night, and an idea just came to me. What if we put a nervous musician and a nervous listener together in a room? What happens then?
THC: Are there any lessons that you’ve learned from the first iteration in Taiwan that you’re taking with you to Boston and Cambridge?
RYC: I had a lot of assumptions about what would happen, but none of my assumptions were right.
First of all, I thought no one would come. I remember on the very first day before the opening, we were setting things up and a violinist was just tuning inside the room. People walked by and they went, “Oh, whoa, what’s going on?” We explained that in fifteen minutes we were going to start this project. They were like, “Oh, that sounds so interesting, we can stay here and wait.” People just started lining up, and the line didn’t stop for the next three days. Every minute, someone was waiting outside. It blew our minds.
My second wrong assumption was that I thought people would look away because it was so close. I thought that the musicians wouldn’t feel comfortable, either. With the door closed and just two people face to face, the listeners either looked at our face or at our hands. I realized that they wanted that connection — they wanted it to be special as well. We did interviews with them afterwards, and we asked, “How did you feel? Was it too close?” Everyone said, “No, it was perfect.” They kind of proved that the traditional concert hall setting might not be working.
THC: Can you talk more about where the line between social experiment and performance exists in Concert for One, and where it’s blurred?
RYC: It’s a social experiment because despite our Taiwan experience, the Celebrity Series and I have no idea how this project will work out in Boston. We have no idea how the people here will react, we don’t know what might happen. With each listener and each musician and each minute, it will be completely different.
THC: How have you seen your own music practice influence the direction of Concert For One?
RYC: The idea came from a sense of need. I’d seen a lot of discussions on the future of classical music and how we can really be in touch with the flow of the world and be successful in terms of competing with other genres. As a classical musician, I feel like this is the direction we need to go. We need to be more personal for the sake of the musicians and the listeners. From the reactions I’ve gotten from the musicians and listeners, I believe that this is the beginning of a change in the world of classical music: how we are presenting ourselves and how we are being perceived. Everyone says that the world is getting smaller, but people are getting further away from each other, and I believe that classical music can be the change. It’s not that we need to overturn everything from our training, but I feel like we need to be able to try to experiment, to embrace new opportunities, to create more connections. I’ve always known that there are people that support and adore classical music, and there are others that prefer other genres, but there is also a big group of people who haven’t had the opportunity to connect with these musicians, and they haven't decided yet. That is the group that we have to reach out to.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We get it, Toby: You’re a newly-single forty-something who’s just discovered that women might be into you because you’re somewhat attractive and a doctor making mid-six figures. And we get it: Tinder is great because all these women know what they want and that is to fling themselves at you. And finally, we get it: Rachel, your wife from whom you’re separated is a bitch who left the kids with you and has now disappeared, leaving you to do this thing called “parenting,” when you’re just trying to make your way through New York City’s eligible single women. Yes, you are raising the kids and do all the tasks a mom would typically do (this stereotype is slowly fading away, right?), and it’s clear you love your job as a hepatologist. You’re principled and you do the right thing. (Not like your philandering best friend, Seth.) Your idealism is both admirable and real. We get it. But that doesn’t mean you’re not an annoying prick who fails to admit any fault in your marriage and insists on playing the martyr while ignoring your friend Elizabeth to swipe right on every woman you see. Elizabeth is the narrator, so have a little more respect, all right?
Taffy Brodesser-Akner’s debut novel, “Fleishman is in Trouble,” follows the Toby Fleishman of afore-mentioned bachelorhood fame. Of course, the novel isn’t just about his deeply-rooted insecurities about whether women are actually into him (they are, Toby — please get a grip). It’s a larger commentary on marriage in modern America and the curious way in which it seems to rob people of their identities, shaping them into people tied to routine and stagnant in every part of their lives except for their children. At least, this is how it is in Fleishman’s New York City. Beyond the city itself, and some of its wealthy outer environs, New York is a very poor barometer for how people really live in America. As a result, much of the dramatic pettiness that plays out in the novel is fueled by the novel’s setting, such as Rachel’s insistence that their old apartment is not good enough, prompting the entire family to move to a larger one on the Upper East side. She’s a talent agent, so they can afford it, thank God.
It’s very much a novel that could only have been written in 2019, and the various debates Toby has with his daughter Hannah over buying her a phone, or with his residents at the hospital, land well and merit a chuckle. These moments are much needed and appreciated because much of the rest of the novel is, well, bleak.
Some of these “very 2019” moments are dark and terrifying — such as when Toby must pick up Hannah from sleep away camp because a nude she sent had circulated among the campers. She only sent it to one boy, she said, and he promised he wouldn’t share it. But at 11, Hannah learns that this is not how the world works — and especially not the world of middle schoolers with iPhones permanently glued to their hands. Hannah is sent home, while the boy is not, in a moment of injustice that is far too familiar.
The children, Hannah and Solly, could have been the highlight of the novel, if they weren’t so dislikable. It’s easier to excuse them, however, seeing as they are children. The rest of the characters, unfortunately, are difficult to like. And since they make up the majority of the people given lines of dialogue, the unlikeability becomes too much to bear. They also do not seem to serve any discernible purpose, and instead detract from the themes Brodesser-Akner sets out to address.
Brodesser-Akner does a fun thing where she’ll repeat paragraphs — verbatim — pages or chapters apart to illustrate the monotony and cyclicality of marriage and adult life. This device only makes the reader start to wonder what the hell is going on. This lazy device keeps the novel in a stasis that, if the readers wanted to feel, they could just get married themselves. After all, character drives plot, but rarely do we see more than the various characters’ selfish desires to run away from the lives they’ve willingly signed up for.
It’s tricky to write a novel that addresses the change that people will continue to undergo once they are married. It’s been said that marriage now is a tad more taxing than it was decades ago, when people realized that marriage couldn’t give them everything they wanted. Now, spouses are expected to be sources of stability, but also someone who inspires spontaneity and flexibility throughout life’s inevitable changes. Factor in being a best friend, sexual partner, therapist, parental figure (at times), or caregiver, and it gets exhausting. Brodesser-Akner points out that the institution is confining, especially because it’s a decision made, usually, when one is still growing and figuring things out.
And yet — the frenetic energy of the novel overpowers everything, even the characters themselves. The manner in which Elizabeth’s own weed-fueled musings on her unhappiness is a step in the right direction, and yet it still reads as self-indulgent and performative. This is prose that knows it is prose and is trying very hard to be ironic and say something grand about the human condition. While it succeeds at the former, in places, it fails to do the latter. Which is a shame, because Brodesser-Akner raises some poignant questions about why women feel trapped in their marriage; why the life they’re supposed to want is unfulfilling, boring, or exhausting; or why people struggle to improve their lives. The reader is left crying out for serious engagement with these ideas, and this could be told through tragicomic lens. That does not come to pass. Irony for its own sake in contemporary literature is boring and tired. Cultural commentary —this novel included — tries to be quirky to make the terrible things life throws at us a little bit easier, but all it does is create distance from what is being discussed. In the end, people are still miserable, except their feelings are buried deeper. Caring and vulnerability have become the conceptual equivalent of the persona non grata. No character in this novel ever really gets vulnerable except Nahid, and when she does, Toby realizes while he thought he wanted to date her, now the excitement is gone. Bummer.
That’s the other issue: It seems as though Brodesser-Akner envisions a world in which all marriages are ill-considered and initiated for the wrong reasons. Cynicism, too, is another twenty-first century cultural symptom of not knowing how to confront the vastness of the world. Perhaps feeling fear isn’t all that bad.

Sadie Jones’ latest novel, “The Snakes,” is an odd one. It’s not really about snakes at all — they’re featured for an early moment, only to make brief cameos thereafter — unless you count the characters themselves. Maybe not Bea, the protagonist who has rejected her parents’ money and now suffers in expensive London. But certainly her father, Griff, and his wife, Liv (who quickly becomes the most annoying and abusive character), are “snakes”. Perhaps these are the snakes Jones alludes to, but the result is a book that can’t decide it if wants to race ahead like the thriller it should be, or take many (many!) painstaking pages to dwell on each character’s internal psyche. Because it lacks interactions that could further the plot, “The Snakes” is a frustrating read that is poorly timed but contains small moments of gold that make it worth finishing.
Some of those moments are Jones’ British witticisms and syntax, poignantly captured in sentences like, “‘I often think the British Empire was built by men just getting out of the fucking house.’” She also calls all policemen “pervy racist knobs,” which would be reassuringly amusing if it weren’t a horrific American (and apparently British) reality. Jones walks the fine line that exists between writing eyebrow-raising stereotypes about Europeans spoken through the mouths of her characters, and making the reader wonder, “Does she actually believe this?” The least controversial of those statements include, “Her English came easily and her accent was comforting, he associated it with rational Europe, and bureaucracy.” These moments spice up the novel, especially since her jolting prose make it a difficult read at times.
Now for the plot: Bea and Dan, a married couple, decide to take a trip to clear their heads and stop in France to visit Bea’s brother, Alex. As soon as her parents join him, Alex mysteriously disappears. “The Snakes” will intimately acquaint any reader with the French police process, which can be either riveting or horrifically boring, if you’re a reader that enjoys a properly-paced thriller.
Bea and Dan are pretty close, but fundamentally disconnected. He comes from a multiracial working-class background, which makes it difficult for him to understand why Bea has rejected her family’s money. Despite her work as a therapist, Bea does not open up to her husband, and while this choice is understandable, it proves to be the fulcrum upon which the lever of the story balances: The longer she delays talking to him, the longer the deep-seated family dysfunction goes unresolved. The chapter in which Dan is interrogated by openly racist French policemen is the most raw and moving in the entire book, and is arguably Jones’ best-written scene. This experience, and those in his past to which Dan repeatedly alludes, is the dividing line between husband and wife. But unfortunately most of these moments are never adequately confronted in the context of the novel. This lapse is disappointing: Character drives plot, and since Bea never evolves, neither can the story’s trajectory.
It’s not completely a dud, however. Jones has wonderfully poignant lines such as when she describes the light in someone’s eyes as “all movement inside herself, like a wasp in a glass.” But these lines can’t save a novel that should be a thriller, or a family saga, or a psychological exploration of familial trauma, but which in actuality is none of the above. While the book is partially all those things, it does none of them well — which is unfortunate, because Jones has the writing ability to do so. She follows each thread part of the way before abandoning it in favor of another, leaving questions unanswered and readers frustrated — making “The Snakes” a disjointed read.

Spider-Man does it again with another blockbuster hit, involving plenty of CGI animation and action-packed scenes. “Spider-Man: Far From Home,” the sequel to “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” involves a coming of age story about Peter Parker’s (Tom Holland) journey to self-validation. Despite Spider-Man’s superhuman status, he’s an everyman hero, hoping to live a normal teenager’s life before following in Iron Man’s footsteps. Director Jon Watts resuming his directorial role, constantly reminds the audience of the fact that Peter is still at his core an awkward teenager, which makes him all the more lovable and makes for great, relatable comedy.
The movie starts without the main character in sight. Instead, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., are in Mexico battling an unusual, monstrous villain, one that takes the form of a tornado and happens to have a face. Quentin Beck (Jake Gyllenhaal) appears conveniently to take down the bad guy. Back in New York, a video montage remembering Iron Man ends as Peter Parker excitedly tells his best friend, Ned (Jacob Batalon), about his plan to sweep MJ (Zendaya) off her feet during their two-week school trip to Europe. When Nick Fury calls, Parker ignores the call and happily travels to Europe with his classmates. However, Peter’s respite is short-lived when the amorphous villain resurfaces in Europe, burdening him with the responsibility to grow up and fill Iron Man’s shoes. However, the story lacks real dramatic tension because once Peter realizes the villain’s ruse, the plot loses momentum and the stakes of the action are lowered.
The action scenes are some of the best parts of the film. “Far From Home” includes stunning visuals of Europe, with wide-range shots that allow a viewer to fully appreciate the views. The use of CGI in this film only enhances the grandeur of the epic fight scenes. It was an interesting move on the screenwriters’ part to involve a plot that pokes fun at the guilelessness of the citizens and heroes in the Marvel Universe, their willingness to believe every epic tale spun by the media. In a world where superheroes are real, it seems that anything is possible. The film’s villain capitalizes on the way the public buys into superficial appearances, which makes for a timely and relevant commentary on the sensational world of media today.
While the characters are relatable high schoolers, they seem to be, at times, high school archetypes. The chemistry between the restless teenagers is excellent, and the hilarious scenes on their cramped, lawless tour buses accurately capture the spirit of high school. However, it’s a little disappointing that the high schoolers’ shenanigans and Peter’s struggle to express his feelings to MJ overshadows the weightier issues that other characters hint at, like the worker exploitation in Stark Industries. It would have been interesting for Watts to delve into the politics of the Marvel Universe, or for Peter to grapple with Iron Man’s imperfect legacy.
Yet in a way, the smaller issues that Peter deals with are just as impactful as the bigger ones. “Far From Home” resembles the typical study abroad student story: Peter embarks on an international journey with high expectations, only to realize that the same petty drama has followed him halfway around the world. The film expertly tells a familiar coming-of-age-story in which an infatuated teenager pursues a longtime crush, with a twist: Peter must deal with the added pressure of saving the world. As most Marvel movies do, the film leaves audiences with a good takeaway lesson. Peter goes through a journey of self-discovery after he receives a high-tech prized possession that Tony Stark leaves for him, one that Peter eagerly hands off to someone he thinks is a more deserving protegee. The device bestows its user with Iron Man’s technical capabilities, literally giving the user Iron Man’s powers. Peter’s conscious struggle to choose his future for himself, rather than having it handed to him, makes for the best and most emotional storylines in the film. As one watches Peter become more confident in himself and his identity, one cannot help but root for him.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After meeting regularly throughout the summer, Harvard’s graduate student union reached three tentative agreements with the University in a bargaining session Tuesday. The recent progress comes more than seven months after the two sides last found common ground in agreements in January.
This week’s agreements — including consensus on intellectual property, health and safety, and the formation of a union-management committee — brought the total number of agreed provisions to seven since bargaining began last October.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers announced the agreements in an email to its members following the session. The intellectual property agreement requires the University to clarify its procedures for disputes over intellectual property and prohibits retaliation against union members who brings claims, according to the email.
The health and safety provision would ensure student workers receive “proper training,” protective equipment, and joint meetings between them and the administrators discussing health and safety issues. Both sides also agreed to a union management committee — a common practice in labor relations — that will serve as a direct line of communication between the union and the administration, the union said.
Despite the new consensus, HGSU and Harvard have yet to come together on any economic proposals, and remain at loggerheads on non-discrimination and anti-harassment procedures.
During this week’s bargaining session, the union scaled back some of its economic proposals, according to the union’s email. Negotiators reduced the amount they are seeking for family insurance benefits and transportation subsidies to “reach compromise on other articles,” and merged two of their healthcare proposals, according to the email update.
The changes to the proposals were primarily to “simplify the proposals” and do not decrease the “coverage or quality in healthcare” the union is seeking, union bargaining committee member Cole M. Meisenhelder wrote in an emailed statement. The healthcare proposals still include subsidies for childcare, emergency funds, and health insurance for student workers’ dependents, according to Meisenhelder.
“Part of negotiations is finding compromise on both sides between our goals and the administration's goals,” Meisenhelder wrote. “We are still looking at improvements in benefits for student workers.”
Despite the latest development, however, the two sides remained at odds on a sexual harassment and nondiscrimination proposal, along with an economic proposals, according to the union’s email.
“On many remaining issues, the administration has told us ‘we have nothing else to say,’” Meisenhelder wrote. “As long as the administration refuses to negotiate over the health plan or denies student workers a neutral process for cases of discrimination or harassment, we will not be able to come to tentative agreements on these issues.”
The University has proposed “many new benefits” for HGSU-UAW members, University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement.
"This includes the creation of funds totaling more than half a million dollars to assist bargaining unit members in covering the costs of dental and dependent health care, as well as child care,” Swain wrote. “As the negotiations are ongoing, we look forward to continuing to work on these important issues at the bargaining table.”
Swain wrote that the University also offered union representatives seats on several committees that work to make recommendations on these issues — including the University’s Title IX Policy Review Committee and a newly formed task force on mental health — because the University does not want to create separate policies for union and non-union members.
“The University continues to have concerns over HGSU-UAW’s requests that are the equivalent of carving out their membership from other students regarding University policies that affect multiple groups on campus, including healthcare and non-discrimination,” Swain wrote.
Last month, HGSU-UAW threatened to hold a strike authorization vote this fall if stalemates over the sexual harassment and nondiscrimination proposal, wages, and medical benefits are not resolved.
The union wrote in this week’s email update that the current situation “makes clear we will need to continue taking greater action to win a fair contract.”
Before HGSU’s bargaining committee could initiate a strike, its members must hold a strike authorization vote. If the authorization is ratified, it would empower the bargaining committee to initiate a strike, but does not mean that one would necessarily happen.
The two sides have scheduled more than six hours of bargaining for September, according to the union’s email.
