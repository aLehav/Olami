After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About seven years ago, it would have been impossible to envision Kendrick Lamar’s rise to prominence. He had just released a series of deeply mediocre—and occasionally outright bad—mixtapes and EPs, culminating in the inconsistent “Overly Dedicated.” A year later, he had improbably released the brilliant, deeply underappreciated “Section.80”—an album predicated on a prodigious gift for storytelling (“Kesha’s Song”) and a sudden discovery of lyrical talent (“Rigamortis”). After another year, he released one of the two best rap albums of the decade, “good kid, m.A.A.d. city,” and followed it with the well-received “To Pimp a Butterfly,” a brilliant and occasionally incomprehensible piece of art. His latest effort is “DAMN.,” out 25 months later, on April 14.
“DAMN.” is a return of sorts—a return to the “Overly Dedicated” days of Lamar’s career, a time when Lamar was a brilliant soul trapped in the body of a bad rapper. Perhaps it should make a difference that this imprisonment was self-imposed, that “DAMN.” seems to be working to satirize many of the worst tropes of rap, that by embodying the spirit of unwarranted self-aggrandizement (“DNA.” and “HUMBLE.”) and sensitive misogyny (“LOVE.” and “YAH.”), Lamar places himself in a position to criticize them. Nevertheless, it is difficult to sustain the listener’s interest in satire even over the course of a song (although Lamar has done it successfully in the past in “Swimming Pools (Drank)” and “A.D.H.D.”). It is nearly impossible to make satire the basis of an entire album. Most problematically, in order to do it, Lamar has to embody a musical style that he never sounds comfortable in.
Lamar appears to be playing with someone else’s sound (even if the intent is to satirize it). He acts the role of the influenced rather than the influencer. “GOD.,” “LOVE.” and “LUST.” all sound like disciples of the Drake school for sing-song-rapping. The spirit of Lil Uzi Vert sounds palpably present when Lamar raps “Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah” on “DNA.”
But, say what you will about Drake—he always could sing. Lamar cannot. His voice tends to sound pubescent when his lyricism wanes, one reason “LOVE.,” “GOD.,” AND “LUST.,” work poorly. And say what you will about Lil Uzi Vert—he always sustained a persona somewhere between amusing and charismatic. Lamar never really could sustain a song on the force of his own personality. That is why “ELEMENT.” could serve as a precise metaphor for poor musical decision making.
Lamar could never afford to acquiesce to the tropes of mainstream rap because he frankly does not have the raw, unquantifiable, star personality of Migos, Drake, and J. Cole (among others). It does not matter if that acquiescence is in the name of satire, or if that acquiescence is an attempt to add nuance to a currently straightforward genre of music: “DAMN.” sounds the same either way. As he moves towards the artistic median of rap, Lamar loses everything that made his music compelling. On “LUST.,” a song that requires little explanation other than its title, Lamar raps (sings, gargles, and whines are equally apt verbs), “Let me put the head in,” in a way that somehow manages to be equal parts unconvincing and gross. (And, it should be added, unintentionally ironic when contemplated as a double entendre about intelligence in rap.) On “FEEL.,” presumably about how Lamar feels, he evokes Eric Garner’s death with such detached intonation that the listener is forced to question, for the first time in his career, if Lamar actually cares.
“DAMN.” trades the oddball beats of “To Pimp a Butterfly” for more conventional production by Mike Will Made It (“XXX.” “HUMBLE.” “DNA”). It trades the cohesive narrative thread of “good kid m.A.A.d. city” for an unfocused linkage of themes. It trades the generational commentary of “Section.80” for a selfishly introverted perspective. These are not acts of artistic laziness, à la Drake—they are artistic mistakes. They are mistakes that hide his prodigious lyrical ability under the guise of a disinterested voice (“ELEMENT.” “FEEL.” “LUST.”) and unpleasant crooning (“YAH.” “LOYALTY.” “LOVE.”).
Do not allow this judgement to obscure the complexity of the album. “DAMN.” is a work of art that filters its themes through one of the finest minds of our generation, and that brilliance can be faintly heard simmering under the surface of the work’s lowest frequencies. On “DNA.” he raps, “I got realness, I just kill shit 'cause it's in my DNA / I got millions, I got riches buildin’ in my DNA.” On “FEAR.” Lamar repurposes the lyrics of “DNA.” to alter a simplistic interpretation of the former track, “’Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God.” It is not purposeless self-aggrandizement—it is self-aggrandizement to meditate on the relationship between his life and God. On “PRIDE.” he ingeniously creates a sense of internal conflict through its unstable relationship with the following track, “HUMBLE.” And “FEAR.” would be the heart of “DAMN.” if the album had a soul.
However, those drops of genius are hidden under such a wealth of unpleasant and misguided musical decisions that it becomes a masochistic battle to appreciate any trace of lyrical brilliance. “XXX.” opens with Lamar, presumably rudely woken up at an early hour of the morning, rambling “I'll chip a n**** little bit of nothin'.” He proceeds to rap over an instrumental built around a police siren—a sound that is quite literally designed to be as unpleasant and penetrating as possible. And then, for a moment, Lamar seems to strip away every unnecessary piece of sonic design. Over a bass, a keyboard, and drums, for a moment he just raps, sounding truly comfortable for the first time on the album: “America's reflections of me, that's what a mirror does.”
This is not to say that Lamar has to rap about “socially conscious” issues, like on “To Pimp a Butterfly,” if he wants to be successful. In fact, his first foray into attempting to become a purely socially conscious rapper, “i,” was his worst single since his “Overly Dedicated” days. It is to say, however, that Lamar owes it to himself to make music that he knows he can be successful making—to embody a sound that he is comfortable within (and that is certainly not synonymous with the general direction of rap). Lamar owes it to himself to actually add something to the progression of music instead of following Drake and Lil Uzi’s occasionally valuable sonic innovations. He may be more brilliant and more nuanced than other rappers. He may be flat out more talented than anyone in the general vicinity of a microphone. But on “DAMN,” he does his best to obscure that ability almost beyond recognition. There is nothing more reprehensible than an artist wasting his talent. “DAMN.” proves that statement’s all-caps, disappointing truth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard students, we know all too well that the first question we will be asked by our peers when we return to campus in January is about the summer. Classes start again, and we start furiously filling out applications and seeking out interviews with the abstract hope of landing “something” by the end of the school year, leaving us at the risk of the negative feelings of stress, judgment, rejection, and fear, all the while trying to excel academically. The necessity of finding plans can all too often begin to feel like an existential conflict.
Students have a variety of available options, most often choosing study abroad programs, research, and internships in public service, finance, consulting, and technology. With this broad array of opportunities comes the general expectation that students “make the most” of their summers by taking advantage of one of these options. Going home to work a “regular” summer job and spend time with family can be looked down upon. After all, it's not exciting enough, and does not bring the same social capital (or real capital) as a shiny internship in a big city.
This phenomenon is only a byproduct of students' tendency to compete to secure the most prestigious summer experiences. Though this sort of competitiveness pervades many aspects of life at Harvard, in the context of summer plans it only serves to induce anxiety in much of the student body and overlook the particularities of many students' circumstances.
The challenges of utilizing break times for professional development experiences can be compounded by the geographical distributions of such opportunities, especially for students who live in rural or less populous areas. For those who live in the Northeast, finding a well-paid or exciting internship back home or in the Boston-Cambridge area is a much more realistic possibility. The same can be said for students from booming cities full of young professionals and opportunities such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, or Chicago. Students from these areas have the chance to simultaneously go back home to see their families while building up their resumes.
Moreover, students who live in close proximity to Harvard are also privileged with the ability to spend shorter breaks as well as weekends at home. For peers who hail from towns much farther away, expensive plane fares can prohibit travel home. Students who live in advantageous areas may not think twice about not seeing their families all summer or missing home when they have had multiple instances to visit throughout the semester. On the other hand, students from other areas are often faced with a more stressful choice: to take advantage of one of the few times they can see their families during the year or to take advantage of the many opportunities that Harvard provides.
In addition to geography, socioeconomic status plays into this situation. For some, their summer plans can be easily funded personally while other students have to consider the summer and term-time contributions that the University requires. This leads many people to prioritize funded or paid opportunities over those that may seem purely recreational or not academically-oriented.
We nevertheless appreciate the University and especially the Office of Career Services for aiding the summer planning process through the provision of funding, the facilitation of on-campus interviews, and the giving of advice to make opportunities more accessible to students. We are thankful for their efforts to help students pursue a variety of different summer experiences when possible.

Dear Harvard Professors of All Disciplines,
We, members of the Global Health & AIDS Coalition, expect to see you at the March for Science on April 22 in Boston, New York, Washington, D.C, or any of the other march sites where you may find yourselves that day. We urge you to be there because we know―we have learned from you―that science is principled, health is political, and knowledge is powerful.
We hope that many of you will be in attendance on Saturday, and we are proud to hear that President Drew Faust and Professor Naomi Oreskes will be speaking at the Harvard rally on the morning of the March. For those considering staying home, we hope to persuade you otherwise.
At Harvard, we have had the privilege of learning from professors like Pardis Sabeti, whose pioneering work in computational genetics revealed the mode of transmission of the Ebola virus, and Institute of Politics fellows like Peter Staley, who left his job on Wall Street to lead ACT UP’s efforts to make early treatment accessible to HIV-positive individuals. We know that scientific progress―and the translation of that progress into the lives of everyday people―comes from determined individuals.
We do not write only to professors of the natural sciences, because a threat to any science is a threat to truth and the fundamental processes of research and knowledge dissemination. In this way, the issues that the March for Science attempts to address are issues that should stir academic professionals across every discipline.
Leaders at Harvard taught us to recognize our collective power in guiding the scientific agenda. As young HIV/AIDS activists who learned from those who came before us, we know the power of science and the danger of silence. After governmental neglect during the critical first years of the outbreak, HIV/AIDS became the widespread epidemic we witnessed in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s, and the global pandemic we continue to see threatening the world’s most vulnerable populations today. The war waged on science in 2017 not only challenges existing research, but also prevents further investigation into issues that are deliberately neglected because of their political contention. By removing any mention of climate change from the White House website, this administration proved its willingness to eliminate important issues from the executive agenda. Moreover, cuts to public broadcasting funding threaten access to informative and educational media programming, destabilizing the foundation of knowledge communication in our country.
Now is an important moment to stand up, as we know many you have stood up in the past. Each year, Harvard affiliates join the Global Health & AIDS Coalition as we host a World AIDS Day Vigil on the steps of Memorial Church. Each guest speaks to their experiences with the HIV/AIDS movement; some celebrate how far we have come in halting the epidemic, and others remember the loved ones they have lost. Everyone acknowledges that we have the biomedical tools to end the epidemic, and laments the lack of political will to do so. The March for Science is an outstanding opportunity for students and faculty to come together in this way, to support the progress we have made, and to envision the discoveries we have yet to make. As students we are looking to our professors, many of whom have devoted their entire lives to science, as our best leaders in this moment to galvanize the opposition to scientific denialism.
Science is only as good as the people who sustain it. Just as there are ways to see scientific work that has alleviated human suffering and opened new ways of interacting in the world, there are also histories of racism, sexism, and unethical experimentation; many groups remain underrepresented in the production of science. This is why we ask that our world-renowned professors who perform rigorous, discipline-defining research do not shy away from this moment for fear of controversy. We need your intellectual might and your passion for progress too much. Our institution has made some of the biggest advances in scientific history, so let us use this academic prestige for good.
We hope that professors are similarly engaging with the many other social and political issues that impact members of our Harvard community everyday. As health activists and aspiring health professionals, publicly communicated science is the subject we feel most qualified to directly urge our academic community to support. We need to see you, Harvard professors, alongside your students, proudly affirming the people, places, and policies that enabled you to become thought leaders.
Katie L. Blanton ’18 and Shayla B. Partridge ’18 are History and Science concentrators in Leverett House. Evan MacKay ’19 is a joint Statistics and Sociology concentrator in Currier House. All three are organizing members of the Harvard College Global Health & AIDS Coalition.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In middle school, the summer before eighth grade, a pair of black kids, rumored fresh from Newark, moved to the purple house across the street, along with their cop mother, single uncle, and more. I didn’t talk to them, since I was under house arrest until I redeemed myself from failing summer school algebra II (no, it didn’t matter that I didn’t know algebra I yet, money was paid, mistakes were made, and our real estate agent’s son already knew calculus) but when July got too sticky, I’d watch them through the living room window. They played football on the street, while their uncle sat on the step smoking. When school started, they ripped the place up in a similar way. When an Asian playing Ninja took out his air gun and shot, one of them told him he was doing it wrong, showed him the right way, and said he knew because his mom was a cop. We got off at the same bus stop and walked on opposite sides of the streets. We didn’t talk, but we were friendly. They once chased down a dog my sister was running away from while I laughed in the corner. Then my family moved two blocks away and I never saw them again, except occasionally at school. There were so few black kids in my hometown that they stood as concepts formed by media, history books, and music, more than real people, especially to the Asian kids, who collectively ate, did calculus, debated Ravel vs. Debussy, and sucked up to biology teachers, separate from even the white kids.
During freshman year, I made my first black friend. She was my roommate, came from Queens, went to an all girl’s prep school on a scholarship, and spent all of first semester thinking I was way too artsy and ridiculous to befriend, since I was a self-proclaimed fiction writer and wore heels quotidian. I thought she was rude for not inviting me to her birthday party, but that was before we were inseparable. My town was so de facto I had never really imagined reaching the interiority of a non-Asian person. I spent a lot of high school reading about Brooklyn’s Red Apple Riots, Rodney King, anti-blackness in Asian circles, and anti-Asian hip-hop lyrics, which led me to believe that on a grand-scale, our racial groups did not get along. She knew the price tag on my boots, my parents’ jobs, and that I was bougie enough to know which Rachmaninoff symphony was my favorite. When she worked in the financial aid office over the summer, her co-workers were surprised when she said her best friend was this rich Asian girl. My Asian friends kept telling me to bring the black girl along more often because they thought she was funny.
Though the college often encourages, funds, and attempts “cross-cultural” connections through grants and rhetoric, genuine ones are rare. When last year, police officer Peter Liang murdered an unarmed black man Akai Gurley, the Asian American Association, Chinese Student Association, and Black Student Association banded together for a discussion at the Institute of Politics, but, by all accounts, the discussion was lackluster. The absence of connection was evident even in how we sat at the table, black students on one side, Asian students on the other. But that wasn’t a surprise. There was a black table in Annenberg, but there was an Asian table too. We knew our friendship was an anomaly, because in many ways, we were privileged enough to be anomalies. Having gone to a mostly-white prep school, she had already learned to explain without asking what some people felt did not need to be explained. She was used to extending sympathy to others more privileged than herself. I was lucky enough to come from a place where yellowness was more or less a norm. Unlike many, I was confident enough in my racial identity to be vocal.
Yes, we did talk about things outside of race. But it became evident that race affected almost every important thought we had. I had faith in economic, educational, and cultural institutions because my parents had gone to grad school and were successful, and I reaped the benefits of that process. She had less faith because her dad, who also finished grad school, ended up working the same job he had when he was nineteen during the recession. She affectionately called the Fed, whose impact I’d studied the entire semester in introductory macroeconomics, the “do-nothing bank,” to which I freaked out. She didn’t like my textbook analysis of the minimum wage. When she saw ambulances in Cambridge during the day of a Black Lives Matter protest, she automatically assumed that the protest in Boston had gone horribly wrong. I cried at “Looking for Luke” because Luke’s dad’s rationalization of his suicide reminded me of my own father. Our eyes were shaped by our color, which had to be explained in detached, difficult dialogue.
I have never written about Moonlight before, but I loved it. I viewed it as one views her first love on her final date, with awe, break, silence. I watched it four times, once with my best male friend, once with my sister, once with my father, and once with my roommate. I remember each person’s response, but the one that stands out to me is my roommate’s, who told me she expected it to be better. I got so offended I wouldn’t talk to her for a day. But after, I thought of it as she did, then I thought of it as I did. What did it mean to expect more? To me, Moonlight was an end, because I could never imagine a film with only yellow people, talking in a yellow way, with yellow beauty, precision, and rhythm. But what a privilege it is to know that to someone, my end was a beginning, that there were possibilities beyond. What a privilege it is to occupy, even minutely, a mind beyond your own.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduates concentrating in History and Literature will now be able to specialize in an ethnic studies field, following months of student efforts aimed at establishing an ethnic studies curriculum at Harvard.
The new field was announced Thursday in an email to History and Literature concentrators from the department’s Director of Studies, Lauren Kaminsky.
“There are many people across many departments including faculty, students, and administrators who have been working to make it possible for students to concentrate in Ethnic Studies at Harvard,” Kaminsky said in an interview. “History and Literature emerged as a place to incubate an ethnic studies program because it reflects the work that History and Literature students have already been doing.”
According to the email, students with an Ethnic Studies focus will examine how “slavery, diaspora, migration, and colonialism” shape cultural and social movements, especially as they relate to topics including “Asian American Studies, Latinx Studies, African American Studies, Indigenous Studies, and Muslim American Studies.”
The announcement comes at the end of an academic year filled with advocacy efforts for increased opportunities for ethnic studies. Last November, a group of students referring to themselves as the Ethnic Studies Coalition circulated a petition calling for the formation of an ethnic studies department and research center. During Wintersession, some students returned to campus early for an event aimed at planning spring advocacy efforts.
“I think it’s the first step in the right direction and there’s a lot more to be done,” Juhwan Seo ’17, a member of the Ethnic Studies Coalition, said. “ I think there’s a lot to be done especially in the social sciences when it comes to Ethnic Studies.”
Should students elect to enter the new field, they will be required to take eight courses focusing on ethnic studies, along with the six other required courses necessary for a degree in History and Literature. The department’s website was updated to include a palette of dozens of potential course offerings based on the past academic year.
However, Kaminsky noted that more classes are likely to be added in the upcoming school year with faculty who specialize in these fields.
“There’s been a group of faculty who teach ethnic studies courses already who have been part of the committee that has put this together from the beginning,” Kaminsky said. “These faculty are in high demand.”
Members of the Class of 2019 can choose Ethnic Studies when they select one of now seven options for a field of study in May, and juniors will have the option to switch into the new field after meeting with advisers.
History and Literature has often been a home for students pursuing topics related to ethnic studies. In her email, Kaminsky congratulated senior concentrators who pushed for the new field and said this is only the beginning of efforts to make ethnic studies more accessible across multiple departments and disciplines.
“It was a natural fit to be the first place to begin,” Kaminsky said. “This is much bigger than History and Literature.”

The Undergraduate Council's Rules Committee will only recommend new student groups for approval if they are not too similar to existing ones as part of a College-wide charge to limit redundancies in student organizations.
The Office of Student life assigned the UC Rules Committee with creating new criteria to judge whether or not to recognize new student groups—a procedure previously conducted by the Office of Student Life. Citing a proliferation of student groups at the College, the OSL said it would not recognize any new clubs this semester.
A new plan for club recognition—set to begin in fall 2017—requires the Rules Committee to provide the full UC with a recommendation on whether or not to approve a new club before the OSL will “rubber-stamp” that decision. After a year of provisional status, the UC will have final approval by majority vote, according to the Committee's chair, Evan M. Bonsall ’19.
Among the Rules Committee’s criteria for evaluating prospective clubs is a stipulation that student groups “are not duplicative” and “avoid clear similarities with other student organizations,” Bonsall said.
The Rules Committee’s plan also requires prospective student groups to have at least ten members at the time of their application. Bonsall said that although the ten member requirement existed under the old system, it will be “strictly enforced” by the UC.
Administrators have echoed a concern to limit overlap in student groups. Harvard College is currently home to 442 recognized student organizations.
“The reason that we’re doing this is because again there have been proliferation of student groups which are often quite small in terms of their regular membership. Maybe they only have a few truly committed members, whose mission, whose purpose, whose activities...overlaps to a very, very great degree with multiple other organizations on campus,” Bonsall said.
Bonsall added that the committee had passed its plan onto Assistant Dean of Student Life Alexander R. Miller for official approval, and that he does not expect any “major substantive changes” from the OSL.
He added that he worries that groups with only a few members will misuse privileges that come with College recognition, like the ability to receive funding from Harvard.
“There’s a proliferation of clubs on campus that are very small, they might have two or three or four members, and often times these very small groups are not particularly active, but they can still apply and potentially receive thousands of dollars,” Bonsall said. “We just want to make sure that we’re being fiscally responsible.”
The Council will vote on whether or not to approve the proposed guidelines at their next general meeting on Sunday.

UPDATED: April 21, 2017 at 9:47 a.m. A lawsuit challenging Harvard's compliance with Title IX could last into 2018 if the court accepts a schedule jointly filed by both the University and the recent graduate suing.
Under the proposed schedule, lawyers representing Harvard and plaintiff Alyssa R. Leader ’15 would have until Oct. 2017 to gather evidence and depose witnesses, according to a document filed in the Mass. District Court Monday. The last event is set for January 2018, and both Leader and Harvard have requested a jury trial.
Leader filed the lawsuit in February 2016 alleging that Harvard responded with “deliberate indifference” to her sexual harassment complaint while she was a student at the College. Leader filed the complaint in 2015, alleging that a male undergraduate, “John Doe 1,” sexually abused her during and after a dating relationship. In her lawsuit, she argues that the University did not properly respond to the complaint and violated Title IX.
Harvard has denied all of Leader’s claims that it violated Title IX or was in any way negligent, and moved to dismiss the case last June. Last month, the court struck down three of Harvard’s four primary arguments and denied its motion to dismiss.
Alexander S. Zalkin, who is representing Leader in court, said the long wait is “expected” because there generally is a significant time period leading up to a trial.
“We’re certainly pleased that the judge denied the vast majority of Harvard’s motion to dismiss, which is allowing the case to go forward,” Zalkin said. “And we’re hopeful that we’ll be able to truly find out Harvard’s full response to my client’s reports and hopefully get some compensation and remuneration for Alyssa, for the damage which she suffered as a result of Harvard’s conduct.”
Harvard’s compliance with Title IX has been under scrutiny before. In 2014, the United States Department of Education found the Law School in violation of the anti-sex discrimination policy, and the College’s compliance with Title IX is currently under investigation by the federal government.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College’s Committee on Student Life considered the potential challenges of creating "inter-House dining societies" at its meeting Thursday, arguing that inclusivity and diversity of membership should be a priority going forward.
While The CSL’s discussion on “inter-House dining societies” focused on gathering initial ideas and airing potential concerns, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana has signaled that the College may begin considering how to enact the proposal as early as this summer.
The idea to create “inter-House dining societies” was included in 46-pages of recommendations for implementing the College's penalties on members of single-gender social organizations.
Composed of around 40 students, the “inter-House dining societies” would have weekly meals in dining halls and plan on and off-campus “social activities” such as “a visit to a cheese cellar.” The report also suggested these groups could “eat in elegant attire” and “read Chaucer out loud.”
At the final CSL meeting of the term, students and Faculty Deans expressed skepticism about the money and space that the proposed “eating clubs” would require—a turn of phrase that members began using during Thursday’s meeting, noting the proposal’s similarities to Princeton’s eating clubs.
John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67, an Adams House Faculty Dean and CSL member, said that he thinks two priorities of the “inter-House dining societies” should be inclusion and diversity. He added that the groups could serve as an opportunity for students across class years to socialize.
“If we will support this and make this happen, the membership has to be open. There has to be policies that say diversity is something we care about,” Palfrey said. “This is a great opportunity for freshmen to meet upperclassmen. Here is the opportunity to do that.”
Throughout the meeting, members said they were worried that students dismiss the idea as a top-down mandate from the administration.
“The proposal itself reads as something that was heavily influenced by the administration—in part, because of the timing and, in part, because of the content of the proposal,” said Rebecca J. Ramos ’17, a CSL member.
She added: “I think the potential exclusivity of these organizations is probably the biggest concern, although there’s also a lot of concerns about how these organizations would be funded.”
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair stressed that the proposal is still in its early stages and that one of the goals of the CSL is to give feedback and advice about emergent campus issues.
“Starting a new tradition is often difficult and I think every idea deserves thoughtful consideration,” O’Dair said. “I think it’s important for the CSL to weigh in on—with the expertise around the room—any thoughtful consideration about the idea.”
The policy to penalize single gender social groups is also under review by a faculty committee and University President Drew G. Faust recently indicated that the sanctions may be simply an “interim step” as part of a broader effort if the current single-gender social organization policy proves ineffective.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Two Harvard researchers have uncovered a second parchment manuscript of the Declaration of Independence—the only additional manuscript of its type ever to be found.
University Professor Danielle Allen and Emily Sneff, research manager of the Declaration Resources Project found the document, which Allen says dates to the 1780s and was likely produced for the Constitutional Convention.
“No one has ever been aware of its existence,” she said. “From the point of view of thinking about American history, it's significant.”
According to a press release, the parchment, designated as “The Sussex Declaration,” is housed at the West Sussex Record Office in the United Kingdom and likely once belonged to the Third Duke of Richmond, who supported the colonists who rebelled against Britain.
Allen and her team believe the “leading possibility” for the parchment’s origin is that it was commissioned by Continental Congress delegate—and later Supreme Court Justice—James Wilson or one of his allies in order to advocate for the Constitution.
Sneff said that she uncovered the parchment in August 2015, after seeing a catalogue entry in the United Kingdom's National Archives for a manuscript of the Declaration on parchment. She and Allen soon realized its unique character.
Allen said the parchment “sheds light” on Wilson, who was “more important than people have realized.”
Most significantly, the parchment’s signatures are not grouped by states, as they are in the original parchment manuscript.
“The team hypothesizes that this detail supported efforts, made by Wilson and his allies during the Constitutional Convention and ratification process, to argue that the authority of the Declaration rested on a unitary national people, and not on a federation of states,” the press release said.
Additionally, the phrase “pursuit of happiness” is followed by a dash only, without a period.
Allen, a scholar of political theory and classics, established the Declaration Resources Project after writing her 2014 book “Our Declaration: A Reading of the Declaration of Independence in Defense of Equality.”
According to its website, its mission is to “create innovative and informative resources about the Declaration of Independence.”
“There are still questions to be answered about the text itself, the signers, and even how news of the Declaration spread around the new United States and eventually the world,” the website says.
Allen and Sneff are presenting their paper on the parchment at a conference at Yale University today.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard has searched for administrators to lead its Title IX office and bolster efforts to comply with federal guidelines, it continues to turn to staffers with firsthand experience in enforcing them.
Earlier this month, Harvard announced that Nicole M. Merhill and Bill D. McCants would lead Harvard’s Title IX compliance efforts as the Title IX Officer and the Director of the Office of Dispute Resolution, respectively. Both Merhill and McCants are former staffers in the Boston division of the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights.
The pair are not the first former OCR staffers at the helm of Harvard’s Title IX efforts. Mia Karvonides, who left Harvard for a position in OCR’s Washington headquarters in January, worked as an investigator in OCR’s Boston office before coming to Harvard as well. OCR has been investigating Harvard’s compliance with Title IX since 2014.
“The regulators become your staff and your staff becomes the regulators,” higher education law expert Peter F. Lake ’81 said. “It can raise issues of direction and conflict of interest in some cases.”
To address conflict of interest concerns, Department of Education ethics rules prohibit employees from working on any assignments involving organizations they have worked for in the past year without written authorization from the Department. In an interview in January, Karvonides said she would be overseeing offices in other regions outside of Boston.
A Department of Education spokesperson said OCR takes prior job experience working with civil rights law into account when making hiring decisions.
For Harvard administrators, the link between the University and OCR is mutually beneficial: OCR staffers bring to Harvard extensive experience with the federal guidelines.
“Given the nature of the investigative positions at OCR and the skills required in some of the positions in our offices, one would expect to see former OCR staff members in our applicant pool,” Deputy Provost Peggy E. Newell wrote in a statement.
Harvard is the only Ivy League university whose top Title IX administrators previously worked at OCR. But across the broader landscape of American higher education, universities hiring OCR investigators is not uncommon, according to Lake.
“We've seen an increase in the number of people who have left OCR who have come to work for college campuses,” Lake said. “In fact that's pretty typical of regulatory bodies—a certain number of people leave the regulatory agency to then work in the field.”
For universities, former OCR employees bring firsthand knowledge of civil rights law and how the government enforces it. “You also get an insight into what OCR is most concerned about, what kinds of things are mentioned, even how they process through the data that they're looking at,” Lake said. “I think in many ways it's hugely advantageous for schools to have that.”
OCR investigators are eager to meet this demand, according to Colby Bruno, senior legal counsel at the Victim Rights Law Center.
“To OCR, people who are paid as government employees, to go in house as a Title IX coordinator, it’s like a significant bump in money,” Bruno said. “So it’s sort of a perfect storm for a lot of people who were at OCR, because they have the qualifications, they know they’re a good fit, they know they can do the job.”
From a victim rights perspective, Bruno says populating Title IX offices with former OCR employees makes for better investigations.
“I think that they’re more familiar with the process, and I think that’s a good thing,” Bruno said. “You know what prompt and equitable looks like. You also have access to decisions you’ve been involved in.”
But Jessica R. Fournier ’17, a member of Our Harvard Can Do Better, said Title IX administrators with knowledge of the ins and outs of the regulatory process may not always serve the best interests of students. Fournier said she worries that former OCR employees can use their insider knowledge to ensure that the University remains just on the right side of the law.
“My sense is that Harvard isn’t hiring them with this idea that they’re going to implement Title IX best practices,” Fournier said. “What they end up doing in practice is just focusing only on the potential for litigation and the potential for legal consequences, which keeps them from going beyond the bare minimum that’s required from them by the federal government.”
University spokesperson Tania DeLuzuriaga wrote in a statement that Harvard’s policy provides protections beyond minimum compliance with Title IX. “Harvard’s Policy conforms not only to Title IX — which bans sex discrimination — but also to state laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex, orientation, and gender identity,” she wrote.
A faculty committee is currently reviewing the Harvard policy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three marine scientists discussed the detrimental impact human activity is having on the evolution of ocean organisms Thursday as part of the Evolution Matters Lecture Series.
The panelists fielded questions about the current state of the planet’s various ocean ecosystems and how to prevent  further environmental damage.
Professor of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Peter R. Girguis began the discussion with an overview of the changing marine ecosystems around the world.
“Death and disease caused by polluted coastal waters cost us $13 billion a year,” Girguis said.
The panelists discussed changes to environmental ecosystems, expressing concern about the methane being released on the ocean floor and lowered oceanic oxygen levels. The trio pointed to climate change as prompting some of the changes.
“How does the ocean respond to that? Can the organisms that live in the ocean buffer the atmosphere and consume that gas before it goes out?” said Samantha B. Joye, a professor at the  University of Georgia.
While elaborating on one of the many ways humans rely on basic processes of marine ecosystems, Bruce H. Robison, an ecologist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, referenced the beneficial carbon pump created as organisms migrate from the deep sea to surface layers of the ocean during nighttime.
“They bring organic carbon out of the surface waters, down into the midwaters, and then help to sequester it onto the seafloor,” Robison said. “If we don't do something about the way we are heading, we are going to see massive changes of the composition and structure of these vast oceanic ecosystems.”
Randi D. Rotjan, a professor at Boston University, said she worries that the changes to marine ecosystems and coral reefs specifically “may be perceived as subtle or minor” and that people would not understand the gravity of the damage.
Girguis emphasized the need to take immediate action to prevent the significant effects of global warming on the world’s marine ecosystems.
“Paying for car insurance seems like a waste of time until you get hit,” he said.
Joye also voiced concern for the current “obscene” environmental destruction, but she expressed hope for the future of green energy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year was the first time in history that both Harvard men’s and women’s golf teams won the Ivy League Championships in the same season. This weekend, the teams will look to make history once again and defend their victories at the 2017 Ivy League Championships. The men’s team will compete at the Stanwich Club in Greenwich, Connecticut, while the women’s team will travel to Orlando, Florida to play at the Orange Tree Golf Club.
The men’s team is captained by senior Daniel de la Garza, who tied for 10th place at last year’s championships. The Crimson also boasts three of the four top golfers in the Ivy League. Junior Greg Royston, and seniors Robert Deng and Kendrick Vinar are ranked second, third, and fourth, respectively. While these upperclassmen have led the program, much of the team’s success can be attributed to its depth.
“We have eight excellent players who can contribute on any given week, and everyone played in at least one event this year,” Vinar said. “With respect to work ethic, this team is exceptional. Every team I’ve been a part of during my four years has worked hard, but this year’s team has worked extremely hard.”
That hard work paid off in the Crimson’s last tournament at Princeton. The Harvard team put on an impressive performance, besting all Ivy League competition to place second behind Seton Hall. This result bodes well for the Ivy Championships this weekend, as Harvard has proven its strength against the other Ancient Eight teams.
Sophomore Austin Capart was key in the Princeton Invitational, placing second as one of only three golfers to finish under par. He was able to edge out Princeton’s Michael Davis, who has been an imposing figure on the course all season. The Crimson will look to top the Tigers’ junior, who is ranked first in the Ivy League, again this weekend, but on a larger stage.
“It’s always fun to be playing against the other Ivy League schools,” Royston said. “There’s some good rivalry there.”
Harvard, in particular, may enter the tournament with a target on its back as the defending Ivy League Champions. But the win also gives the team valuable experience and motivation.
“Last year’s win was great for the program,” Vinar said. “Going forward that experience only helps us. We all know we have what it takes to succeed at this level. There’s a balancing act of maintaining confidence without getting complacent or presumptuous. Our team has done a great job of that this year.”
Battling complacency is also a focus of the women’s team, which has won five consecutive Ivy League titles. The team has also racked up three tournament wins this season, at the Navy Fall Invitational in September, the Delaware Invitational in October, and more recently, the Navy Spring Invitational two weekends ago.
Sophomore Michelle Xie has played a critical part in the Crimson’s success, with three first place finishes this year, earning the Palo Alto, Calif. a No. 2 ranking in the Ivy League behind Yale junior Jennifer Peng coming into the conference championship. Her most recent victory came on April 1st at the Harvard Invitational in Sarasota, Fla. where she swept the field and helped Harvard to the podium behind Princeton and Boston University. She hopes to replicate this performance when the team returns to Florida on Friday.
“Our team is incredibly process-focused, so going into this weekend we are all making sure that we are each in our personal best mindsets,” Xie said. “I have personally had my best season at Harvard so far, and would love to continue to play well this weekend.”
Xie is not the only Harvard golfer to have a strong season. Sophomore Anna Zhou and captain Anne Cheng also should be watched. Zhou has two individual tournament victories, while Cheng has tallied four top-ten finishes in five tournaments. Despite the team’s impressive results, the captain still sees room for improvement.
“We’ve had a lot of rough starts and rough patches throughout the season,” Cheng said. “But the team has definitely gotten closer and I think we’re always on the track to getting better in terms of our game.”
The Crimson will hope to make these final adjustments before it plays this weekend, as both teams look to defend their Ivy League titles.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s the offseason, but the Harvard men’s hockey team, fresh off its memorable campaign to the Frozen Four, continues to experience firsts. With the announcement that juniors Eddie Ellis, Jake Horton, and Merrick Madsen will captain next year’s team, the Crimson’s uniforms will sport three “C’s” for the first time in the program’s 119-year history.
“We’ve had a long tradition of having one captain, and this group of kids had the option of voting if they wanted more than one,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 explained. “I’m excited, and I think we got an interesting mix for captains.”
While typically operating with just a single captain, the Crimson, including this past season, has used a pair of captains nine times in its history.
Harvard’s 2017-2018 leadership group marks the 128th, 129th, and 130th captaincies since varsity hockey’s inception at the school. Madsen, set to don the crimson “C” from the crease, is the first Crimson goaltender to captain a team since the 1979-80 season saw John Hynes ’80 do so.
The announcement of Harvard’s historic three-headed captaincy came during the team’s annual end-of-year awards banquet, although the Crimson icemen already knew the results of their closed-door vote. Before the ballot, the players—the class of 2017 included—explicitly established that they wanted three captains for the upcoming campaign.
“I think that guys find that there’s a good balance between different types of captains that they like to have,” Ellis said. “Each guy just voted on his own on the number [of captains], and I guess most of the guys felt that…the most effective way that we could lead next year would be with three guys.”
Ellis, Horton, and Madsen look forward to assuming a greater leadership role in 2017-2018, as Harvard says goodbye to seven impactful seniors—a class that combined for a NCAA-best 193 points last season while providing invaluable mentorship in the locker room.
Horton attributes a large part of the Crimson’s success in the recent campaign to the tone set by the entire senior class, not just co-captains Devin Tringale and Alexander Kerfoot.
“Having the entire senior class being leaders and having everybody take on a different role…when you do that, your message gets spread a lot deeper,” Horton noted. “You have all seven seniors basically preaching the same message, and guys are going to buy it.”
Donato stressed the importance of leadership coming from all the seniors, rather than from just the captains.
“Over the last few years, our leadership has become much stronger…. We didn’t rely on just the guys who were wearing the letters,” Donato added. “Alexander Kerfoot and Devin Tringale were tremendous captains. I think one of their secret weapons was that they shared leadership as well.”

The captains effectively began their new roles as soon as they were announced. Tringale and Kerfoot are set to meet with next year’s trio in the coming weeks, and they’ve already passed down the reins to the three rising seniors, who will strive to foster this culture of leadership that extends beyond the letter-bearers.
“I never really understood how much [Tringale] and [Kerfoot] had to do behind the scenes,” Horton said. “You kind of really just become an intermediary [between the coaches and the players].”
The tri-captains will also work alongside ex-Navy SEAL Adam La Reau, whose team-building and leadership expertise has been vital to Harvard men’s hockey since 2013, to plan the coming year and set team goals.
“With Adam Le Reau, us captains might all sit down to have a conversation about what kinds of goals we want to have,” Madsen said. “Then the captains would go and run a meeting with the players...with the help of Adam—to kind of all get on the same page.”
The Crimson captains, still fresh off a thrilling ride to the Frozen Four this past year, are already looking ahead to next season, in which anything short of a national title game appearance will disappoint, according to Horton.
In the meantime, while many team members typically spend a portion of their summer in Cambridge for a combination of on-ice training, coursework, and internships, next season’s captains hope to assemble the whole team on campus at some point during the recess. This week of training and team bonding would presumably help the incoming freshmen acclimate to Harvard’s hockey culture.
“It’s going to be a pretty intensive three-day workshop,” Horton said. “We want to try and replicate [last season] and even take one more step so we can kind of avenge that [Frozen Four] loss.”
The Crimson will certainly be young up front next season after the departure of half of the forward corps, so this brief summer session may go a long way in reloading for 2017-2018.
On the back-end, the team returns five of six defensemen, as Madsen prepares to lead a skilled and experienced blue line. Goalie captains are a rare sight, mainly because they cannot leave the net to confer with referees mid-game—one of captains’ primary on-ice duties. Perhaps this explains why the team preferred a third letter-wearer, but Madsen’s play this past season made a strong case for his earning the “C” regardless.
The Philadelphia Flyers’ 6th round draft choice in 2013 finished the season among the NCAA’s top 15 in both save percentage (.923) and goals against average (2.11). Plus, he boasted the league’s second highest win percentage (.806). Arguably his most impressive feat, Madsen recorded the longest ever win streak by a Harvard goalie.
As far as the other two captains are concerned, in 2016-2017, Horton set career highs in goals (six), assists (seven), points (13), and plus/minus (+2), while Ellis appeared in 17 games and notched two points in the process.

So we finally know who the Yardfest artist is, after a pretty agonizing wait. We’ve all heard complaints about the announcement. You say you’ve never heard of him? Think again—we’ve compiled a list of Tiësto’s most famous songs, and we can guarantee that you’ve heard some of them. And if you haven’t, it’s time to get listening so that you can gear up for one of the best days of the semester.
Wasted
Let’s face it, we like almost everything better when we’re wasted (including Yardfest). You’ve heard this jam too many times on the radio, it was played long past its used-by date, and it’s about to make a comeback. Expect a lot of excitement when Tiësto gets to this track.
Red Lights
This is the song that you’ve heard at plenty of parties but you probably never knew what it was called or who it was by. Well, this is a Tiësto signature, so now you can’t forget it. On a serious note, we hope that Tiësto drives safely on the way to Harvard and does not, in fact, run those red lights.
All of Me (Remix)
We know that you know Tiësto’s remix of the John Legend classic. It’s just the right mixture of emotional ballad and upbeat dance music. It’ll get stuck in your head all day, so don’t be surprised if your foot starts tapping during lecture.
The Only Way Is Up
Maybe the rumors about Martin Garrix for Yardfest were onto something, since this song marks the creative union of Tiësto and Garrix. It is a classic EDM number, with words that cannot be fully made out and some quality beat drops.
Secrets
Tiësto put together this track in collaboration with KSHMR and Vassy (Will they make surprise appearances at Yardfest? We sense a new rumor in the making here.)  We know that Tiësto knows a little something about keeping secrets, though, from how long we had to wait to find out that he’d be the artist.
If you aren’t listening to these songs on repeat between now and Yardfest, you should really reassess your priorities. Tiësto definitely has some gems and we’re excited to hear them in our own backYard.

As results from midterm season start to roll in, you may be realizing that perhaps it's time to refine your studying techniques. Or maybe that you should have studied in the first place. We get it. Studying in your room is impossible when you have a bed right there calling your name. Your other options seem to limited to Lamont and Widener, which are radiating enough stress and angst that it sends you rocketing back to your middle school emo phase. And stop lying to yourself—you’re not getting any work done in Lamont Cafe. So, as finals season creeps toward us, scope out some of these alternative study spaces:

The New Cabot Science Library
Newly renovated and just recently unveiled, the Cabot Science Library in the Science Center should be your new study space. Everything is so sleek and shiny, and not yet imprinted with the stench of all-nighters and despair. Many parts are spacious, not restricting you to the tight cubicle designed constraints that Lamont offers. Also, Clover is apparently manning the cafe, so if you like seiten, give it a go.
Harvard Law School Library
This is a library we feel exists more as a myth than an actuality, but we're certain it must be somewhere on campus. Urban legends say that this library has free coffee after 9 p.m., but it seems like everyone who tells you about the HLS Library has never actually been there. We've heard only good things, though. Also, the more you frequent it, the greater the likelihood of you marrying a rich lawyer, which means you don’t have to worry about studying anyways.
The Great Outdoors
After months of a grueling, exhausting winter, spring is finally here! Reap these benefits, bring your books outside, and plop yourself in one of the Yard’s many multicolored chairs. Or sit on Widener's steps (don’t actually step foot in Widener though). It’s hard to be miserable cramming for SLS 20 when the sun is shining and the birds are chirping. You’ll need the Vitamin D after two weeks of living like a cave-dweller in Lamont.
We think it’s high time you try to give one of these other places a shot—not only because we want the word “Lamonster” to be eliminated from our vocabularies, but because we want this finals season to be your best yet!
