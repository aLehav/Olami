After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s not a lot going for uncertainty.
As Harvard professor emeritus of zoology and biology Richard Lewontin wrote in the preface to his book “Biology as Ideology: The Doctrine of DNA”, “a simple and dramatic theory that explains everything makes good press, good radio, good TV, and best-selling books.” Meanwhile, he noted, “if one's message is that things are complicated, uncertain, and messy, that no simple rule or force will explain the past and predict the future of human existence, there are rather fewer ways to get that message across.”
It makes sense that people aren’t necessarily comfortable with the idea of uncertainty. When you face uncertainty, there is more activity in emotion-related regions of your brain like the amygdala and anterior insular cortex, according to Harvard neuroscience professor Elizabeth Phelps. People can face ambiguity aversion, where they would choose to face known rather than unknown risks, even when the known risk may be a less optimal choice.
But as we strive to understand life’s complexities, uncertainty is inevitable in science.  So let’s consider the dance between the two.
First, in regards to terminology, “uncertainty” in science isn’t not knowing but a measurement of how well something is known. For example, in climate science, uncertainties in global temperature rise refer to the margin of error, the degree of exactness in an experiment or theory or prediction. It’s about how hot the stove is, not whether or not the stove is on. Second, though science aims to remove unknowns about the world, it will always be a work in progress.
Ed Yong, science writer for The Atlantic, told me in an interview that “science is often mischaracterized as a procession of facts, whereas it really is much more of a meandering path towards less uncertainty.” Thus, it is crucial to emphasize that the scientific process is nebulous and dynamic, and that scientific conclusions that can change based on additional evidence.
“People might not be used to the idea. But I think that's because we as a field have often done our job badly. We've conditioned people to expect easy answers when the truth is usually much more complicated,” Yong said.
In many ways, it would be more painless to consider science as a series of proclamations climbing with each new discovery and data point. And in many ways, more information has decreased scientific uncertainty.
Harvard astrophysics professor Alyssa Goodman founded The Prediction Project, which analyzes how humans have made predictions from ancient civilizations to modern frameworks. In some ways, Goodman said, uncertainty has decreased substantially over time. Weather forecasting, for example, has become far more refined with modern data and technology.
But information and data aren’t necessarily proportional to certainty and predictive power. In the early 19th century, a French physicist wondered if we could predict everything. In a concept now known as Laplace’s Demon, he posited that if someone (the demon) knew the position and momentum of every particle in the universe, then the past and future states of those particles – and by extension, states of the universe – could be deterministically predicted.
“It turns out that quantum mechanics comes along and basically breaks that, as does chaos theory,” Goodman said in an interview. “There's just some element of randomness in them that you cannot get rid of.”
Sometimes, accumulating data might even bring a false sense of security to scientific advancement. Many even see big data as the key to decreasing uncertainty, though others are skeptical.
“Data collection is the easiest thing for the government to fund and the easiest thing for people to do,” Craig Venter, the synthetic biology pioneer known for his contributions to the Human Genome Project, told me in an interview. “It makes them feel like they're making great progress. I think science should be focused on accumulating knowledge. Now, sometimes you have to accumulate a certain amount of data to accumulate new knowledge, but way too much of science is an endpoint of accumulating data.”
In fact, since massive genome sequencing projects have emerged, data have generated confusion. Cancer researchers expected to find similar cancer-causing mutations, but found that healthy tissue can contain more mutations than many tumors, and the mutation frequencies of patients with the same cancer type can vary by three orders of magnitude. Even in disorders which are attributed to a single responsible gene, individuals with and without a disease can have the same genetic mutations, and mutations can damage gene function but not cause disease manifestation. Clearly, given such genetic heterogeneity, we will have to carefully consider how we structure research fields like precision medicine.
Throughout this column, I’ve examined many aspects of the scientific process, from funding mechanisms and reproducibility to peer review and public communication. In each step, uncertainty underscores how the science operates and its social implications.
To increase understanding of science, then, it is necessary to acknowledge and contextualize uncertainty, not hype up or ignore it, both to the public and among scientists. We must embrace uncertainty as we continue along this endless frontier.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 6, 2021 at 12:30 a.m. 
Harvard will require that all students receive a Covid-19 vaccine to live on campus during the fall 2021 term, the school announced Wednesday.
The announcement comes as vaccination appointments are becoming more readily available across the United States, and it follows similar declarations from other universities, including several in the Boston area.
In an email to Harvard affiliates, University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote that students should plan to receive a vaccine authorized by either the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or the World Health Organization at least two weeks prior to returning to campus.
The school will allow exceptions “only for medical or religious reasons,” Bacow wrote in a joint statement with University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp, and University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen.
International students and those unable to access a vaccine will be able to receive the vaccine once they arrive on campus, but may be subject to frequent testing until they are fully inoculated, they wrote.
In an interview with The Crimson Wednesday afternoon, Bacow said he does not expect vaccine hesitancy among students to hinder inoculation efforts.
“The indication that we’ve had in conversations with students to date is that students are actually anxious to get vaccinated,” he said. “If they’re vaccinated, they’ll have far greater access and privileges to a variety of things on campus.”
Bacow said the timing of the University’s decision to require vaccinations hinged on the availability of the vaccines.
“We did not think it was appropriate or fair to require vaccinations until [the] vaccine was widely available and so that’s why we waited,” he said.
Harvard will continue to test on-campus affiliates in the summer and fall, according to the email.
“We hope to be able to offer a less restricted, robust on-campus experience for all our students this fall,” the administrators wrote. “These plans, however, depend on low infection rates in our community and across our region.”
Despite the school’s plans to significantly increase the number of students on campus in the fall, Bacow told The Crimson Wednesday that he does not anticipate difficulties expanding on-campus testing capacity.
Currently, on-campus students are tested three times per week. The announcement stated the University will provide further information on the frequency of testing in the fall at a later date, but Bacow said he is hopeful the requirement will lessen.
“It’s certainly our hope that as more people are vaccinated that the testing requirements for those vaccinated would be less than for those who are not vaccinated,” Bacow told The Crimson.
Harvard will begin offering vaccination appointments through HUHS for the first time on Friday. The University had previously received only a limited supply of doses, but will be able to offer Pfizer doses to affiliates and HUHS patients “as a result of our close academic relationship with Mass General Brigham,” the administrators wrote in the announcement Wednesday.
“We have reached a point where it appears now that there’s going to be adequate supply so that we can more quickly vaccinate people who wish to be vaccinated,” Bacow said in the interview. “I think that if that continues to be the case, I’m hopeful that we’ll have access from a variety of sources to more vaccine[s] to distribute through HUHS.”
Wednesday’s announcement did not include a vaccination requirement for faculty, staff, and researchers working on campus, but the email encouraged them to “make every effort” to be vaccinated.
“Further guidance regarding vaccination expectations for faculty, staff, and researchers is under consideration and will be provided in the near future,” the administrators wrote.
The administrators also announced that Harvard has relaxed its outdoor mask requirement, no longer mandating masks when six feet of distance can be maintained in line with updated federal guidelines.
