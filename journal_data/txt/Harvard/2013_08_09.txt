After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania—The city rose half-built along the coast. Enterprise and resources somersaulted over each other, tripping and colliding in their haste to erect the next gleaming structure. Some towers soared twenty stories high, paned in rippling blue glass; next to them skeletons stood unfinished, all concrete and steel backbones with no one to complete them. Few people seemed to question why so many bare buildings lined the streets year after year. There were, after all, bigger problems.
I spent the first half of the summer in guesthouses that were basic by American standards yet prohibitively expensive for most locals. Still, I bumped up against the “real” Tanzania every day. My pale skin never failed to cause a stir on the walk home from work, no matter how much I tried to blend in with ankle-length skirts and Swahili greetings. I spent weekends in chaotic markets, hunting for bicycles and earrings and everything in between. I stuffed my money down my shirt to keep it safe, snuck into fitness clubs, and bargained for my rickshaw rides as well as I could.
I spent the second half of the summer in a diplomat’s mansion in the nicest part of the city. The peninsula jutted out from Dar defiantly, daring the street vendors and bus stands to approach. For the first time in my life, I lived as part of the one percent. I viewed the city as though I was behind a mask; there it was as I hurtled to the airport on the back of a motorbike, and there it wasn’t as I stepped through our iron gate at the end of the day. The mask slipped and I stared at a young woman with a debilitating limp from behind my taxi’s tinted windows. The mask went back up and I ignored the cashew-sellers circling outside.
I returned to Zanzibar near the end of my trip and lay on a pristine beach all day, watching the tide dance back and forth along the shore. By mid-afternoon, what was once a uniform azure became a mottled seabed. The retreating water exposed the softest sand in the world, its hidden eddies and puddles present only at low tide. Light burst from the dark clouds and illuminated the world in bright greens and hazy grays. Locals suddenly swarmed from the north, a never-ending line across the ocean floor, like Moses crossing the Red Sea. For hours, they dug through the muck to collect massive seashells that would soon crowd the walls of tourist shops.
Back on the peninsula, an ocean breeze cut across even the most stifling of days. I ran down dirt roads at dusk, past gate after gate and guard after guard. Embassies flitted by as I turned onto the road next to the ocean, where I could gaze at pink-flecked clouds and starry boats while diplomats raced home and maids trundled onto crowded minibuses which would make their way back to the bare skeletons lining the streets in the distance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Alexander Holler, 17, was so excited about attending the Harvard Secondary School Summer Program that he skipped a month of high school back home in Germany to participate in the program. He arrived in Cambridge in June looking forward to rigorous courses, new experiences, and a taste of college life—but he is leaving Harvard with those expectations disappointed.
“I expected [the program] to be intellectually challenging, which it wasn't,” Holler said. “I prefer Europe [for college].”
Holler is not alone. Although high school students from across the world came to Harvard with high expectations, many students said that the program, which ends Saturday, is not worth its hefty price tag—$10,690 to live, eat, and study on campus for seven weeks.
Of the 12 students in the program interviewed for this article, most said they were not adequately challenged over the summer, and almost all said they do not plan to apply to Harvard for college.
“From how much it’s been hyped, I think it’s been a letdown,” said Issa Rahman, a high school student from Dubai.
Rita Pandey, assistant director of the Secondary School Program, said that the only complaint that administrators have heard about the program is that courses, which can be taken for college credit, are too challenging. While program administrators are not involved in the day-to-day process of teaching, she said, they make an effort to help students select courses that will be at the right academic level for them.
“We didn’t hear from even one single person that [the program] was not challenging because we have only found a lot of students struggling and finding [the classes] too difficult,” Pandey said.
But Rahman said that both his academic courses and his social experience were a disappointment. These experiences have affected his considerations for college. Coming into the program, Rahman was mainly considering Stanford and Harvard, but now is strongly leaning toward Stanford because of his dissatisfaction with Harvard’s summer school program.
Olivia Gebhardt of New York said that while she enjoyed the social experience of the program, she too was disappointed by classes that she felt were insufficiently rigorous.
“I honestly thought the classes were going to be a lot harder because [of] the whole ‘it’s Harvard’ thing. It ended up they definitely weren’t as hard as I was expecting,” she said. “But I really like the people here, and I’m going to be really sad to leave.”
Several students also complained about the program’s accommodations.
“I thought that the housing and food was going to be better, since it’s Harvard. [Since] they’re asking for $10,000 from every single person, I thought they’d have at least something moderate,” said Bricherland Quinones of Connecticut.
However, a few students did speak highly of the program. Susie Campbell of New Zealand returned to the summer program for the second year because of her enjoyable experiences the year before. Kelcee Gondalez of the Dominican Republic also enjoyed the new academic opportunities available at Harvard.
“It's certainly different, and I must say I am enjoying the culture. It's much different than back home," Gondalez said. "I think the education here is much better. The classes are much more diverse, which I'm enjoying."
Both neither Campbell nor Gondalez said they plan to apply to Harvard for college. Campbell cited concern that she would be unable to afford the price tag of a Harvard education and instead plans to apply to the University of New Zealand.
Still, most students said that, disappointments aside, the summer school program has expanded their horizons.
“I’ve met so many people from different places,” Campbell said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Square will lose one of its beloved bistros Saturday as Tamarind Bay shuts its doors after nine years of serving Indian delicacies.
According to owner Vik Kapoor, the decision to close the restaurant came after a new landlord acquired the restaurant’s building, and the rent increased twofold.
“For an independent, 50-seater restaurant such as ours, [paying the new rent] was not possible,” Kapoor wrote in an email.
The loss of the storefront, located at 75 Winthrop St., follows the closing of the restaurant’s Brookline location this past May. When the visa of the chef at the Brookline kitchen was denied, management decided to focus solely on Harvard Square.
Now, in the wake of both closures, Tamarind Bay, which was once one of three Indian restaurants in Harvard Square, faces an uncertain future.
Kapoor said that for now, his priority is to find jobs for the existing staff. No decision has been made about a potential new location for the restaurant, he said.
“Once they are all settled in, we will start looking at future plans,” he said.
Leaving behind Harvard Square, Kapoor said that he would greatly miss “not only the culture and the hustle and bustle, but also the fact that we were so loved.”
Katrina D. Malakhoff ’15, a patron, said she is disappointed to see Tamarind Bay go. She said she loved enjoying the restaurant’s high-quality Indian food with friends and cited the student discounts as one of many reasons why she frequented Tamarind Bay. The restaurant often partnered with the Undergraduate Council to offer discounts for students with a Harvard ID, including a 15-percent-off deal during the UC’s Junior Week last winter.
Malakhoff said that while she will try the several remaining Indian food options in Harvard Square, Tamarind Bay will be missed.
