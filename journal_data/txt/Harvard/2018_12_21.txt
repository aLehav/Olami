After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard and Students For Fair Admissions continued to spar over whether the College’s admissions process discriminates against Asian-American applicants in court documents filed Wednesday.
The briefs — each 75 pages long and split into separate “proposed findings of fact” and “proposed conclusions of the law” sections — summarize what SFFA and Harvard see as the most relevant testimony and evidence from a three-week trial that started mid-October.
Wednesday’s documents mark the latest filings in a four-year-old lawsuit challenging the legality of the College’s admissions process. The case, which legal experts say could go to the United States Supreme Court, could shape the future of affirmative action in colleges and universities around the country.
The Harvard brief argues that the College has a legitimate interest in racial and ethnic diversity to fulfill its educational mission and that the College is incapable of achieving such diversity with any race-neutral alternatives.
“SFFA failed to show that Harvard intentionally discriminates against Asian-American applicants on the basis of their race,” the filing reads.
The SFFA filing states that though Harvard argues it promotes diversity, some forms of diversity — namely, religious, socioeconomic, and geographic diversity — are lacking on campus.
“There are 23 times as many wealthy students on campus as poor students,” the filing states. The benefits of geographic diversity “are lacking too at Harvard.”
A central issue in both briefs was the statistical analysis of the admissions process that each side presented at trial. Harvard’s expert, Berkeley professor David E. Card, and SFFA’s expert, Duke professor Peter S. Arcidiacono, offered dueling interpretations of the College’s admissions data. Card argued the data shows Asian-American applicants did not face a noteworthy disadvantage, while Arcidiacono alleged statistics analysis showed sustained discrimination.
Both sides reiterated in the briefs statistical arguments they made during trial, focusing on the personal ratings of Asian-American applicants.
“Despite their superiority in academics, extracurriculars, and alumni overall ratings, as well as their parity with white applicants in school support and alumni personal ratings, Asian Americans receive lower personal ratings than white applicants and do not outperform them in the overall rating,” the SFFA filing reads.
SFFA alleges Harvard disadvantages Asian-American applicants with its personal ratings — numerical scores the College assigns to each applicant. The scores, which range from 1 to 6, assess qualities like humor and grit.
“More than 21% of white applicants receive a personal rating of 1 or 2, as compared to 17% of Asian Americans,” the SFFA filing reads.
The Harvard filing criticized SFFA for attributing the disparity to racial bias.
“There is no factual, logical, or statistical basis to conclude that factors outside the data explain the association between Asian-American ethnicity and stronger academic and extracurricular ratings, while racial bias explains the association between Asian-American ethnicity and weaker personal ratings,” the brief states.
The Harvard brief's proposed conclusion of law is SFFA lacks the standing to sue. According to precedent, only individuals with “a direct stake in the outcome” may invoke federal judicial power, the brief explains.
“[The lawsuit] is instead a vehicle for the interests of its founder, Edward Blum, and the other controlling members of SFFA’s Board of Directors, Richard and Abigail Fisher—all of whom lack a concrete stake in the outcome and therefore would not have been permitted to sue on their own behalf,” the filing reads.
Abigail N. Fisher is a white woman who lost an affirmative action lawsuit against the University of Texas at Austin, which she sued after being denied admission to the school.
Harvard also argued the court should conclude that the school does not discriminate against Asian-American applicants and that it considers race in its admissions processes as allowed by judicial precedent.
SFFA has previously defended its right to sue on behalf of its members. In its latest brief, SFFA stated it “has members who applied to Harvard who were denied admission, and who are ready and able to apply to transfer if Harvard ceased its discriminatory practices” — evidence of a direct stake in the outcome and of a potential for redress.
Attorneys for Harvard and SFFA have until Jan. 23 to submit rebuttals to Wednesday’s filings. Judge Allison D. Burroughs will hear an additional set of arguments from both sides on Feb. 13.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lawyers for Harvard, Harvard Law School, and the Harvard Law Review filed motions Monday to dismiss a lawsuit brought against them by a Texas-based anti-affirmative action group alleging the Law Review’s editor selection process illegally uses “race and sex preferences.”
The group — Faculty, Alumni, and Students Opposed to Racial Preferences — filed the original complaint with the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts in early October, alleging the Law Review’s selection process violates Title VI and Title IX, two federal anti-discrimination laws.
FASORP also named the University, the Law School, and U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos as defendants, writing that “federal law prohibits universities that accept federal funds from discriminating on account of race or sex.” The suit names DeVos because FASORP argues Harvard should not receive federal funding if it violates these laws.
The University and Law School jointly filed their motion for dismissal while the Law Review submitted its filing separately. Both motions argue the University should not lose federal funding for the alleged violation of Title VI and Title IX because the Law Review is independent from the Law School.
“First, FASORP fails to allege that the Law Review receives federal funding. Second, FASORP fails to allege that the Law Review is a “program or activity” of Harvard University or any other educational institution,” the Law Review wrote in its motion for dismissal.
The University and Law School also state in their motion for dismissal that the Law Review is “a separately incorporated and separately governed entity” that Harvard does not operate.
The Law Review’s motion also defends its admissions practices as being in compliance with affirmative action policy laid out by the United States Supreme Court.
“Supreme Court and First Circuit precedent establish that affirmative action policies are permissible under the civil rights statutes when they take into account race or gender as part of a holistic process,” the Law Review’s lawyers wrote in the filing.
“FASORP merely describes the Law Review as having an ‘affirmative action policy’ and fails to allege how that policy impermissibly takes into account race or gender,” they added.
FASORP did not respond to a request for comment.
The University and Law School motion also defended the publication’s admissions policies.
“The Complaint pleads no facts from which the Court could infer that Harvard is violating Title VI...or Title IX,” Harvard’s lawyers wrote.
The University and Law School argue FASORP does not have standing to file the federal suit because the group’s complaint did not name any individual that has directly “suffered or will suffer any legally cognizable injury caused by the challenged practices”, according to the joint motion for dismissal.
Harvard Law Review President Michael L. Thomas Jr. declined to answer specific questions about the lawsuit, and instead pointed to the publication’s motion filed in court.
“Our response to the lawsuit can be found in our motion to dismiss filed earlier this week in Massachusetts federal court,” Thomas wrote in an email.
University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson similarly directed The Crimson to the joint motion to dismiss that Harvard’s lawyers filed in court Monday.
FASORP filed its lawsuit against the Law Review just before Harvard went to trial over the College’s admissions process. In that case, Students for Fair Admissions — the anti-affirmative action group suing the University — alleges the undergraduate admissions process discriminates against Asian-American applicants.
The trial, which lasted for three weeks starting in mid-October, featured testimony from prominent Harvard officials and garnered national media coverage. The trial revealed once highly secretive admissions practices, and experts have said the case could reach the U.S. Supreme Court.
Two of Harvard’s lawyers in the SFFA case, Seth P. Waxman ’73 and Felicia H. Ellsworth, are representing the University and Law School in the FASORP suit. Waxman, a former U.S. Solicitor General, is serving as lead attorney for Harvard.
The Law Review also chose a former U.S. Solicitor General for its legal team — Donald B. Verrilli Jr. — who will lead the publication’s legal team alongside Ryan P. McManus, who has appeared before the U.S. Supreme Court.
The Department of Education did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.
