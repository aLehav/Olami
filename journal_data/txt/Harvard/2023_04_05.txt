After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I returned to Harvard from spring break, laundry was the last thing on my mind. My flights had been delayed by almost eight hours, causing me to arrive in my dorm at 1 a.m. on Monday morning, with class in eight hours. Unsurprisingly, I hadn’t started any of the work that I had promised myself I would do over the break. And I was still covered in sand from playing touch rugby on the beach in Bermuda the day before.
Yet as I unpacked, the smell of a week’s worth of dirty clothes soon forced laundry to the front of my priorities. So with my dirties in one hand and Tide pods in the other, off to the machines in the middle of the night I went. Again.
But as I rounded the corner into the Weld Hall laundry room, I was greeted by those four letters that put all college students into a state of pure ecstasy: F-R-E-E.
Maybe it was the sleep deprivation, or maybe I really do hate paying for laundry that much. But those four letters sent me over the moon. Unburdened by cost, I separated my laundry into three loads instead of shoving it all into one machine and pouring a detergent libation to the laundry gods. I even stripped my bed and washed my sheets just because it was free. As far as I was concerned, this was a new era. Harvard had reinvented itself while I was gone. Paying for laundry was a thing of the past.
How disappointed I was when I came back a week later, also past midnight, and found that laundry was once again $3 — $1.50 to wash, $1.50 to dry. There I was, saying another prayer to the Tide pod gods, hoping that one machine could fit all of my dirty clothes.
Throughout this veritable roller coaster of emotions, I was left with one burning question: Why does Harvard, one of the richest universities on the planet, charge its students $3 for a load of laundry?
Assuming that there are 16 weeks in a full semester, and all 7,103 current Harvard College students do two loads of laundry totalling $6 a week, Harvard is only raking in $681,888 of revenue per semester. And while the word “only” used next to a six-figure number might seem a little absurd, that yearly figure is only about 0.17 percent of the University’s total $406 million budget surplus last fiscal year.
It’s not that I expect Harvard to cover every possible expense that it can afford, but the real absurdity to me is Harvard’s hesitancy to offer free laundry when doing so would bring tangible, significant benefits to every single student.
With free laundry, students would be less likely to overfill the machines, which is good for both them and Harvard. When students do all of their laundry in one load, clothes are not totally clean, negatively impacting the student and their clothes. And unsurprisingly, overfilling of machines is a leading cause of damage to washing machines. By switching to free laundry, Harvard is actually likely to save money on machine repair.
Free laundry would also keep us healthier. Dirty clothes, bedding, and towels are all huge vectors for disease, and removing cost gives students no reason to delay washing their dirty sheets and towels until they can put together one large load. Free laundry would encourage students to wash as frequently as they need, preventing the spread of more germs on campus.
Granting students free laundry would also remove a legitimate — and regressive — financial burden. While tuition, housing, and food can all be covered with financial aid, laundry is funded by Crimson Cash — a fully out-of-pocket payment account for students — or quarters. And the larger the financial constraint that laundry has on students, the more likely they are to overfill machines and delay washing altogether, perpetuating the above problems.
Harvard is behind the pack when it comes to free laundry. Half of the Ivy League — Princeton, Penn, Columbia, and Brown — currently offer this basic amenity to their students, and students are calling for free or more affordable laundry at Yale and Dartmouth, too. Harvard should lead among its peers — or at least join them.
Clean clothes are a basic necessity, yet Harvard does not see them as such. When students are discouraged from doing their laundry by unnecessary financial barriers, washing machines wear out faster, students get sicker, and campus becomes less pleasant overall. As it showed the week after spring break, Harvard has the ability to make our laundry free. So why doesn’t it?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On May 3, 1996, a Connecticut fifth grader named Shonrael Lanier penned her very first book report: An account of her family history, drafted with the help of her maternal grandmother, titled “From These Roots I came.” The report, bound by a tired green spine and geometric covers, reads as follows:
“My roots grow deeper than slave times. Yet it is almost impossible to go further than the lonely, tough times of slavery. Regrettably, I can only tell you as far back as my great-grandfather Fred Thompson.”
“Fred Thompson was born to the former slave Renty Thompson.”
What ten-year-old Shonrael didn’t know, and what her mother, Tamara Lanier, would only discover later, was that the presumed father of Renty Thompson, “Papa” Renty — names travel generationally in her family — was still out there. Not physically, certainly not alive and well, but immortalized, hung, and framed inside the nation’s top academic institution.
While his great-great-granddaughter sang his glories from Connecticut, Renty remained far from his own, captive inside the daguerreotype that Harvard scholar and eugenicist Louis Agassiz had taken of him almost a century prior in an attempt to prove his intrinsic inferiority.
It would take over a decade for Shonrael’s mother to find Renty, and even longer for her story to make it to the public record. Our own newspaper would — inexplicably and despite an early interview that got squashed before publication — introduce Renty to the Harvard community only in 2019.
But by 1996, Shonrael almost knew her link to Renty; he was her blood, kin, and legacy.
***
Shonrael’s mother, Tamara Lanier, had grown up under the humbling shadows of revered ancestors.
“As far back as I can remember,” she told me in a recent interview, “my mom would talk about Papa Renty.” He was “a community person” who didn’t only teach himself to read — “no easy feat,” as Lanier quips — but also taught others “at his own peril”: Renty was an enslaved Black man who held bible sessions for his peers. Tamara’s mother would speak of him “with such a reverence, with such a love and respect.” A man lost to the yoke of false masters and time, of whom little but oral histories remained.
The rest, at this point, is history. By 2010, her health rapidly declining, Lanier’s mother became increasingly fixated on untangling the stories of Renty and others. With her death, genealogical research became Tamara’s uneasy birthright — except she barely knew where to begin.
“I have never broken a promise — and my mom, between us there were no broken promises, there were no pledges made that we didn’t follow through with,” she told me. “And so I really felt guilty.”
Yet luck was on her side; some vague, fateful sense of historic justice seemed to nudge her home. One day, Lanier said, she stopped at “a small ice cream shop to pick up lunch.” Having built up a rapport with the owner through previous visits, she brought up her mother’s dying wish, and he offered to help. Lanier was skeptical — “I remember thinking, you know, at this time, most seniors did not even know how to find the power button to turn the computer on, let alone get on and get to the internet” — but she agreed.
Lanier didn’t visit the shop for a couple of weeks, accidentally slipping out of her role as a regular customer. When she did return, the vendor was ecstatic.
“He was standing at the register, and he threw his hands up in the air and he said ‘Where have you been? I found your Papa Renty,’” she recounted.
The momentum seemed unstoppable. Lanier was forwarded the image of the man she still claims as her ancestor. She was certain when she saw him — she knew, she told me, “that [he] was the Papa Renty I had heard so many stories about as a child, that my children heard so many stories about during their childhood.” Genealogical studies, name tracing, and even a visit to the Deep South followed, each confirming her certainty.
But Harvard wouldn’t budge. According to Lanier, the University and then-President Drew G. Faust repeatedly refused to engage with her requests to get better access to the daguerreotypes or verify her ties to those depicted.
Renty’s story would, yet again, have to wait.
***
By 2016, the situation had become almost farcical. Harvard found itself on the verge of grappling with its legacy of slavery: The University had announced plans to unveil a plaque honoring formerly enslaved individuals at Harvard, inviting civil rights icon John Lewis to speak at the ceremony.
To mark the occasion, Faust penned an op-ed for The Crimson, describing the need to acknowledge a past that “continues to shape us in ways we should not try to erase or ignore,” all while allegedly declining Lanier’s request to attend the ceremony, according to Lanier. (President Faust declined, after directing my query to a University spokesperson, to comment on this story).
This time around, Lanier contacted The Crimson too — aware, perhaps, of the extent to which public pressure might shape the University’s response. The reporters were “thrilled to have the chance to speak with” her, they emailed Lanier, and followed up on her offer to come to Cambridge for an in-person interview. She obliged, and then waited for the article that might change everything — the article that could, overnight, make her tale one the University wouldn’t be able to ignore any further.
Then came the email, subject line “Update on your interview”:
“Unfortunately, we have ultimately decided that we won't be publishing excerpts of your interview because of concerns the Peabody Museum has raised and because recent events on campus have caused our own story to focus more on the Harvard Law School.”
It would take years — just enough to fully renew the makeup of our newsroom — for The Crimson to cover Lanier’s tale. Our own coverage, tethered to the launch of Lanier’s still ongoing litigation against the University, trailed everyone from local Connecticut papers to (by a day) The New York Times.
A Harvard story that merited a lengthy feature in America’s paper of record would remain out of our own pages for three years after it was initially brought to The Crimson’s attention — three more years out of the minds and hearts of Harvard affiliates, three more years out of the spotlight.
***
Lanier never learned what “concerns” the Peabody Museum had expressed to The Crimson in 2016. When I reached out to the museum last month looking for answers, a spokeswoman for the University couldn’t elaborate on them for this article. Still, Lanier seems to hold no ill will towards the student journalists who forsook such an immanently tellable story well after conducting adequate sourcing — “I’m not trying to throw anyone under the bus,” she told me.
But it does seem like someone ought to be under the bus.
The reference to a change in the piece’s focus strikes me as almost laughable: I have not, in my days at The Crimson, met a single news editor who I’d expect to drop a scoop of Lanier’s proportions and never pick it back up. The concerns the Peabody raised certainly didn’t prevent other outlets from telling the story, nor did they deter well-respected legal professionals from championing her case, nor did they stop the Massachusetts Supreme Court from siding with Lanier’s right to pursue claims of “reckless infliction of emotional distress” against Harvard.
We might never find out how or why we missed Lanier’s story: Both the author of the email — now a professional journalist in his own right — and his then-President and Managing Editor declined to comment on the developments on the record.
Perhaps the reporters were simply scared — scared at comments like those the University had provided to other outlets. These comments cast doubt on the accuracy of Lanier’s claims, accusing her of providing next to no evidence, all while, in her telling, failing to even attempt to verify the result of her years-long quest. Scared, maybe, of what would follow if they pursued a story they were sternly advised not to pursue.
Lanier at times sounded like she thought that was the case: “I get the politics,” she noted.
The anecdote is only another minor detail in the textured tapestry of Lanier’s life. But it also holds an unspoken cautionary tale — one meant for all of us who wrestle with spokespeople and PR representatives and cold corporate email accounts you reach out to for any semblance of a comment.
The thing about erring on the side of caution when dealing with stories that stain the powerful is that a fair amount of caution can be bought through intimidation alone — and that not every worthwhile story, not even those that go on to become New York Times features, will be free from fauxly rightful pushback.
Years later, having produced abundant and proud coverage of the Lanier case, we can only awkwardly stare at that three-year gap when her story went untold — when we let her story go untold — and take limited comfort in knowing that we weren’t the only ones.
If The Crimson was late to acknowledge Lanier, the University remains, even later, steadfast in its refusal to do so.
The 132-page-long Report on the Legacy of Slavery at Harvard passingly mentions Papa Renty exactly thrice, but makes no reference to his descendant’s struggles with our University; the Peabody’s website, in an uneasy embodiment of our University’s vacuous well-meaning, includes a land acknowledgment to the Massachusett people but no press release related to Lanier or the daguerreotypes’ uneasy origins.
Turns out that wrestling with your legacy of slavery is less jarring when you discard any of its breathing embodiments.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some members of Harvard’s graduate student union said the first University-wide anti-bullying and non-discrimination policies, released last month, did not reflect some of the union’s proposed changes for a broader definition of “bullying” and greater “neutrality” in the University’s resolution process.
The policies, which will go into effect Sept. 1, came out of proposals of two working groups established by the first contract between the University and Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers.
In April 2022, Harvard released drafts of its proposed policies on anti-bullying, non-discrimination, and sexual harassment, soliciting feedback from affiliates over the course of the summer.
The union’s feminist working group submitted proposed changes to the draft policies to Harvard on Sept. 28. Among other recommendations, the group called for specific language changes to broaden the definition of bullying and harassment, as well as anti-bias training for administrators involved with the complaint process, a clarification about the office or offices charged with handling cases, and a more concrete timeline for cases.
HGSU-UAW President Koby D. Ljunggren said they were initially disappointed to see certain recommendations not adopted in the final policies, but they became “a little bit more heartened” at seeing the other policy provisions.
“While not everything — and from our perspective, some of the most important things — weren’t adopted, there were some very healthy changes, we think, to some of the definitions. And in the very least, our feedback was heard,” Ljunggren said.
With HGSU-UAW on their second contract, these policy changes have been “a long time coming,” according to Marisa J. Borreggine, a member of the feminist working group who participated in drafting the original recommendations to the University.
“It took a lot of time and pressure to get meetings with University officials to even hear us out, so I am disappointed that some of our key suggestions have not been incorporated into the new University-wide policies,” Borreggine wrote in an email.
For instance, the language regarding “bullying” was not adjusted according to the union’s recommendations.
The feminist working group had proposed several adjustments to expand the definition of bullying: that the definition of an act in violation of the anti-bullying policy be changed from “pervasive, persistent, and/or severe” to “pervasive, persistent, or severe”; that an example of bullying be changed from “Deliberate and repeated humiliation” to “Deliberate or repeated humiliation”; and that an example of unwanted behavior be changed from a “physical, verbal, and/or written act” to “physical, verbal, or written act.”
The University did not adopt the second proposed change, but it did alter language related to the first and third points.
The group also recommended that while the University’s policies maintain that critical academic feedback does not constitute bullying, the policies should add a sentence saying, “However, critical feedback is not excluded as evidence in a bullying investigation.” Harvard’s final policy did not adopt this recommendation.
“We want to make sure that the definition of bullying adopted is actually going to be applicable to cases of bullying that we see through our union workplace issue forms,” Ljunggren said.
“We want to make sure there is some recourse even if it’s moderate bullying. There’s still those instances, and they should still be addressed,” Ljunggren added.
Borreggine wrote that certain terms in the policies are “outdated,” such as the University’s definition of discriminatory harassment as “unwelcome and offensive conduct” based on one’s protected status. In their recommendations last year, the feminist working group had criticized the term “unwelcome” conduct, arguing that it “places the burden of proof on the target of harassment or discrimination.”
Another main point of concern is the language and policies surrounding the makeup of “Determination Panels,” which review investigative reports and determine policy violations.
As of now, the policy describes “at minimum, three neutral members” for these panels, but the union has pushed for majority third-party, non-Harvard appointees to the panel.
“From our perspective, we think it’s much stronger and puts a lot more faith and confidence in the process when there is a majority of external decision makers on those panels, and we think that’s an important piece of a truly neutral policy,” Ljunggren said.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment.
In a March 22 interview with the Harvard Gazette, Sherri A. Charleston, Harvard’s chief diversity and inclusion officer, said after the policies go into effect in September, there will be “a progressive implementation” that will “take a few years of refinement.”
“To that end, we want to make sure a constant cycle of quality improvement is embedded into the rollout process, so that as we refine it, we’ll really figure out how to maximize our efficiency and awareness of resources and procedures,” she said. “What we see on Sept. 1 will not be the final product; it will be the beginning of a cycle of continuous improvement.”
Bailey A. Plaman, a member of the union’s feminist working group, said the University’s anti-bullying and non-discrimination policies resembled language in its Title IX policies, which the group has been pushing to amend.
“We were all really disappointed to see that they were based off of Title IX. A lot of language is very similar, if not the same, and a lot of the policy is very similar,” Plaman said.
Borreggine added that there was no “compelling reason” for the University’s anti-bullying and non-discrimination policies to mirror its Title IX language.
“We had a chance here to create policies that were more considerate of the needs of folks who experience harm and how they can be made whole again, and the policies fall short in that regard,” Borreggine wrote.
The University plans to release changes to its Title IX and sexual misconduct policies on Sept. 1, after the Department of Education updates federal Title IX rules, according to Newton.
As for the anti-bullying and non-discrimination policies, Ljunggren said the union can push for amendments to the language through bargaining for them in its next contract.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eli M. Rosenbaum, the counselor for War Crimes Accountability at the United States Department of Justice, discussed federal efforts to address war crimes in Russia at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at a Monday lecture.
Rosenbaum, a 38-year veteran of the Justice Department, currently heads the DOJ’s war crimes accountability efforts. At the event, which was hosted by the Belfer Center’s Future of Diplomacy Project and the Harvard International Arbitration Law Students Association, Rosenbaum said Ukrainian authorities have registered “more than 90,000 atrocity crimes” committed by Russia.
“Russia is perpetrating war crimes on the largest scale seen in armed conflict anywhere in the world since World War II,” Rosenbaum said.
“It’s going to take years, probably decades, to finish pursuing all the cases,” he added.
Rosenbaum, who spent nearly 40 years prosecuting Nazi war criminals at the DOJ, discussed the “enormous challenges” in “a situation in which the crimes are ongoing.”
“The Nazi government of Germany was succeeded by a responsible government that assisted authorities around the world in developing Nazi prosecutions,” he said. “The Russian government is not going to assist us in the search for evidence, even though they possess the largest share of the evidence. ”
“That’s a big challenge,” Rosenbaum added.
At the end of 2022, Congress passed an amendment giving the DOJ expanded power to prosecute any war criminal on American soil, “regardless of the nationality of the victim or the offender.” Prior to the change, only war crimes that were committed in the U.S. or against a U.S. national fell under the DOJ’s jurisdiction.
“In the future, when peace is last attained, and some of the perpetrators begin to travel, if one of them makes the mistake of coming to the United States, and it’ll happen — it happened after World War II, I know it’s going to happen — there’s a good chance that we will know who they are and they can be arrested and prosecuted,” Rosenbaum said.
Rosenbaum said his team will “leave no stone unturned” in their search for Russian perpetrators of international law and warned offenders that the DOJ has a “relentless” commitment to justice.
“You will never have to stop looking over your shoulder and wondering whether someone hasn’t finally found you.” Rosenbaum said. “And if you’re thinking about traveling outside of Russia, you may want to think twice about that.”
After Rosenbaum’s talk concluded, a member of the audience asked him if members of the Bush administration, including former President George W. Bush, should be prosecuted for the invasion of Iraq.
“I will say that no government on earth has ever fully sought justice in the wake of its own involvement in serious human rights and humanitarian rights cases,” Rosenbaum said. “We are no exception. You always strive to do better — I think that's probably the best answer I can give.”
Rosenbaum, who graduated from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania with a bachelor’s and MBA in finance, said he did not originally seek a career in international humanitarian law. But during his time at Harvard Law School, Rosenbaum said, “a little tiny blurb” from the Justice Department’s special unit dealing with Nazi war criminals altered his course.
“I saw that blurb and thought, ‘That’s the summer job for me, I really want that,’ so I applied, and I got the job,” Rosenbaum said.
“My fondest ambition after graduating law school suddenly was not to go into the business world, but to go back to my office at the Justice Department,” he added.
Reflecting on a summer internship that changed his career plans, Rosenbaum offered advice for college students deciding how to spend their summer.
“The lesson of the story is: Choose your internships wisely, because this could happen to you,” Rosenbaum said. “You could end up being a banker. I leave that to you as to whether that's desirable or not, but be careful.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ahead of the Supreme Court’s decision on race-conscious admissions at Harvard, Graduate School of Education Dean Bridget Terry Long maintained in a Tuesday interview that economic affirmative action cannot replicate the racial diversity of current student populations.
Long said the education school’s role is to be a “constant” throughout a changing landscape of education amid controversies over affirmative action, censorship of curricula, and the rise of artificial intelligence.
Harvard was sued in 2014 by anti-affirmative action group Students For Fair Admissions, which alleged that the College’s race-conscious admissions practices discriminate against Asian American applicants. After two lower courts ruled in favor of the University, SFFA appealed the case to the Supreme Court, which heard SFFA’s suits against Harvard and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on the same day in October.
In 2018, Long testified as an expert at the district court level for the suit brought against UNC. Her role was to determine whether a variable other than race could be used in admissions to create racial and ethnic diversity.
Long said her research did not show such a variable exists.
“We’ve also seen that, with a Black middle class, it’s not that income protects you if you’re a person of color,” Long said.
“We’ve seen instance after instance, even here in Cambridge, where you can be the most highly educated affluent Black person and still be treated as a suspect,” Long added.
Legal scholars expect the Court to rule against Harvard due to its strong conservative majority, with a decision expected by late spring or summer. Should the Supreme Court rule to overturn affirmative action, Long said she is unsure of the impact on Harvard’s admissions practices.
“We have large admissions teams, we have holistic review — we can look at so many different dimensions of students,” Long said of Harvard College and HGSE. “But there are two big worries I have.”
She raised concerns about a potential “cooling effect” — a decrease in the number of minority students applying due to a perceived barrier to admission — and a loss of racial diversity in bigger schools that lack the resources to practice holistic admissions.
Long also discussed the following topics:
On the topic of admissions at Harvard, Long said artificial intelligence services like ChatGPT will not be a threat to the quality of students admitted to colleges.
“The essays that really make a difference are the ones that are distinctive and unique and feel real. So I’m not too worried about that,” Long said. “Though I think in the day-to-day assignments, we’re all going to need a lot of training.”
HGSE aims to consider how AI can serve as a tool to promote equity, she said.
“We need to think about ways that we can actually use technology, AI, and other tools to help bring up the bottom, to help address the needs of lower income students, so that it doesn’t increase the gaps, and in fact maybe helps us close some of the gaps,” Long said.
Long said “incredibly dangerous” campaigns to censor Advanced Placement African American Studies and other school curricula could also perpetuate inequity in the classroom.
“If we forget our history, we’re bound to repeat it. There is no question that this is a movement in the wrong direction,” she said.
“We need to be educating students about their history, about how the world is working, and also giving them hope about how progress can be made,” Long said. “I’m incredibly dismayed about the rewriting, sanitizing of history — and it’s not about making people feel bad, but I think we have to be honest with ourselves.”
Long said policies censoring classroom content will “ebb and flow,” while HGSE can provide a stable source of research-grounded advice.
“When the time comes, when Washington is ready for good ideas, we’ll have the evidence ready,” Long said.
To cultivate the next generation of educators, Long said the school wants to “foster and support interest” among undergraduates considering a career in education.
Long said a key solution to the current shortage of teachers — exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic — is both financial and personal support.
“One important part of it is compensation, monetary compensation. But we also have to think a great deal about non-monetary things: working conditions, autonomy and agency, respect,” she said.
“It’s hard to put a value on the contributions that you’re making, because every successful person has a story of at least one teacher who made a world of difference in their life,” Long said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 100 Harvard affiliates, Boston-area residents, and gun control advocates gathered at the steps of Widener Library Tuesday evening to rally for stricter gun legislation.
The demonstration, which was organized by national gun control advocacy group March for Our Lives, followed the fatal shooting of six children and adults at a Nashville school last week.
Speaking through bullhorns, several speakers addressed the crowd to share personal experiences with gun violence, vent frustrations, and issue calls to action.
Yael Cushman, a master’s student at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and former first-grade teacher, cited the frequent lockdown drills in her school in her call for stricter gun control legislation.
“It’s surreal to be sitting through these drills and normalizing something that should never be normalized,” Cushman said. “Schools should be safe spaces where children can learn, play, make mistakes, build friendships — not fear for their lives.”
“I’m angry that teachers have to imagine how they would sacrifice their lives in order to protect their students,” she added.
Cornell William Brooks, a Harvard Kennedy School professor and former president and CEO of the NAACP, spoke about the pervasiveness of gun violence in his address.
“Gun violence affects us whether you walk on the streets, whether you’re in a school, whether you’re in a college campus,” Brooks said. “We’re all collectively victims, witnesses to gun violence.”
March for Our Lives co-founder David M. Hogg ’23 called rally attendees to civic action during his speech.
“We’ve gone through a long, hard cold winter here in Boston, but I’m here to tell you today that spring is here,” Hogg said.
“We must demand action from our elected leaders, for we dictate their future because we are their bosses,” he added.
In his remarks, Hogg also alluded to a “swatting” attack in Leverett House early Monday morning, during which multiple students were ordered out of their suite at gunpoint by Harvard University Police Department officers responding to a false 911 call.
“These halls were all once places where leaders were cultivated — and they still are. But now in these same halls, right down the street at Leverett, they’re being invaded by armed guards, who just yesterday held our classmates at gunpoint,” Hogg said. “That violence has no place here, and we must do more.”
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Hogg’s characterization of the department’s response.
HKS student Rachel A. Jacoby, who helped to organize the rally, said in an interview that she was inspired to get involved in the gun control movement after a string of mass shootings last year, including a shooting that killed seven people at a Fourth of July parade in her hometown of Highland Park, Illinois.
“That really amplified my organizing,” Jacoby said of the shooting.
Ivy A.W. Ryan, another rally organizer and HGSE student, said she and Cushman planned Tuesday’s rally due to a desire to take action in the wake of the Nashville shooting.
“It initially just started as two graduate students at Harvard Graduate School of Education wanting to do something and feeling kind of helpless — and then it grew,” Ryan said.
Ryan said she was pleased with the rally’s turnout, which drew students from several local schools.
“It’s amazing how quickly people can come together when they care about a common cause,” Ryan said.
Jacoby said she believes in the power of collective organizing to drive reform.
“This movement needs all of us, and it doesn’t matter if you’ve been organizing against gun violence for five years, five months, or five minutes,” Jacoby said. “We need all of us and all of our collective power to come together to organize our friends, our fellow classmates or neighbors, our families, in the fight against gun violence.”
“It’s our responsibility to use our voices to fight for gun safety laws and to fight for a future free from gun violence,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Psychology professor B.J. Casey and attorney Marsha Levick discussed scientific and legal perspectives on criminally trying children as adults at a Harvard Law School talk Tuesday.
Casey, a neuroscientist at Columbia University, and Levick, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, examined the ethics of U.S. laws that permit or require children to be criminally tried as adults.
The virtual talk was part of the Project on Law and Applied Neuroscience, a partnership between HLS’ Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics and Massachusetts General Hospital’s Center for Law, Brain, and Behavior. Stephanie Tabashneck, the project’s senior fellow in law and applied neuroscience, moderated the talk.
Casey began the talk by outlining the way children’s brains develop over time, presenting neurological data on individuals aged 10 to 25 years and examining trends in behavior that shifts as children become adolescents become adults.
“Assigning adult status to children is not based on biology or psychology,” Casey said. “Even our laws in this country recognize extended maturation into the early 20s with the extended age for drinking, for parent insurance coverage, and foster care.”
“What you see is that teens, unlike children or adults, make more impulsive errors to those positive social cues than they do the neutral ones,” Casey added, referencing adolescent performance on an impulse control task.
Despite this research, Levick said, adolescents continue to face criminal prosecution as though their brains are fully developed.
“What are we doing holding six-, seven-, eight-, even 10- and 11-year-olds even remotely responsible for criminal activity?” Levick asked. “Even though it is in juvenile court, we tend to apply the same legal considerations in terms of mens rea, criminal intent.”
Levick said many state legislatures have not adapted to accommodate findings in brain development. Instead, they reflect the idea that teens have the cognitive abilities of adults.
“The states have been very slow to catch up,” Levick said, though she noted that California raised the minimum age for prosecution in the adult criminal justice system to 16.
Casey said adolescents are more sensitive to emotional information in the context of social interaction, threat, reward, and stress — a reaction that has practical implications for the justice system. In an experiment examining whether teens choose to go through a yellow light while driving, Casey said, participants took more risks when with friends.
“The minute you put a peer in the room, what we see is a significant increase in these risky decisions and also in the number of crashes,” Casey said.
Levick acknowledged the effectiveness of behavioral treatment for children but added that in reality, the juvenile justice system rarely provides treatment because judges often determine there is “not enough time” for treatment while in the juvenile system.
She added that the U.S. court system is “rare” in that it has “51 different jurisdictions” instead of a national standard, with each having authority to design its own juvenile justice system and “relatively minimal limitations” in the U.S. Constitution.
“The availability of treatment and the access to treatment has real consequences for the changing behaviors that we are able to chart among adolescents in terms of the age crime curve,” Levick said.
“It’s about getting the right treatment,” Casey said, concurring.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lawrence W. Bradley, an environmental geologist at the University of Nebraska Omaha, argued in a lecture last Thursday that fossils taken from Sioux lands should be considered dispossessed Sioux property.
The lecture — broadcast in a hybrid format — examined the influence of fossils extracted from Sioux lands on vertebrate paleontology, mapping out a long history of fossil dispossession stretching from the early 1800’s to the present day. The event was hosted by the Harvard Museum of Natural History, the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, and the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture.
“What is the historical geography between the Lakota paleontology, museums, and universities?” Bradley said at the outset of the lecture. “I hope to convince you that the fossils had been dispossessed from the Great Sioux Nation.”
“Many people think that water, land, coal, timber, minerals, and those types of resources were collected and dispossessed from Native Americans, but we must also think of paleontological resources,” Bradley said in an interview following the event.
Bradley serves on a natural resources board and the Native American Advisory Council in Omaha and has urged state legislators to protect fossils found on Native American lands. He is also a member of the Diversity Committee of the Society for Vertebrate Paleontology.
Bradley’s research examines the history of fossils taken from Native American lands, finding that for hundreds of years, paleontologists have dispossessed Native American tribes of fossils without consent or consultation.
These fossils helped establish American vertebrate paleontology at the expense and neglect of Native American tribes, Bradley contends.
Bradley began this research as a graduate student, leading to a doctoral dissertation titled, “Dinosaurs and Indians: Paleontology resource dispossession from Sioux lands.” In the paper, Bradley outlined the expansive history of fossils removed from Sioux lands without consent. He argued that to resolve disputes between tribal groups and paleontological researchers, it is critical to engage with the historical geography of fossil dispossession.
In the interview, Bradley called the dissertation “perhaps the first” study to argue and substantiate that large volumes of fossils had been taken from Native American tribes.
Bradley said during the lecture that the idea for the dissertation came to him when the University of Nebraska and Nebraska Department of Roads removed a plesiosaur skeleton from the Santee Sioux Reservation.
“That was my ‘eureka’ moment,” Bradley said. “I said, ‘Well, if this fossil’s being dispossessed, then how many, how long, and how much?’”
Bradley, who was raised by Oglala Lakota from the age of two, said he viewed it as “blatant discrimination” that the University of Nebraska did not include students from the Santee Sioux school in the dig.
The University of Nebraska did not respond to a request for comment.
Bradley said educational institutions such as universities and museums should be “held accountable” in the interview, citing the fraught history and lack of collaboration between paleontological researchers and Native American tribal governments.
In his dissertation, Bradley wrote that situating paleontology in a historically geographic context is vital to “allow paleontology to conscientiously advance into the twenty-first century.”
“A new concept of cultural physical geography would demand a multidisciplinary approach and increase chances for modern paleontologists to be sensitive to issues that are situated in the physical environment in which they seek to conduct their research,” his dissertation reads.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Law School Environmental Law Society presented Robert D. Bullard with the Horizon Award in an award ceremony Tuesday evening.
Bullard is a professor of Urban Planning and Environmental Policy at Texas Southern University and director of the school’s Bullard Center for Environmental and Climate Justice. An award-winning author of 18 books on issues surrounding environmental justice and a prominent voice against environmental racism, Bullard has been described as the “father of environmental justice.”
Each year, the Environmental Law Society presents the Horizon Award to an individual who has made “extraordinary contributions to environmental law and policy,” according to the group’s website. Previous recipients include former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, former Environmental Protection Agency administrator Gina McCarthy, and environmental health researcher Catherine Coleman Flowers.
During the ceremony, Bullard spoke about his career and the importance of fighting for social justice in environmental issues. Bullard said his activism has included fighting against landfills in predominantly Black neighborhoods in Houston and addressing the fallout of Hurricanes Katrina and Harvey, which disproportionately affected low-income and minority residents.
“The environment is everything — it’s where we live, work, play, worship, go to school, as well as a physical and natural world. That doesn’t leave much out,” he said. “They want to talk about greenhouse gasses. We want to talk about equity, fairness, injustice, vulnerability. Who’s causing the problem? And who’s most impacted? Who’s getting hurt the worst and the longest?”
Bullard also discussed the need to recognize the interdisciplinary nature of environmental justice.
“Environmental justice embraces the principle that all people in all communities are entitled to equal protection of our environmental laws, housing, transportation, energy, food, water security,” he said. “Civil rights, human rights — it brings it all together.”
Bullard said he believes the future of the environmental justice movement is a “marathon relay,” involving many years of work passed down to each generation of activists.
“We have an environmental justice movement because there is injustice. This is not something we do just for us, where we wake up and say, ‘Oh, I just want to do this.’ We have to fight injustice,” Bullard said. “And so I’m really pleased and humbled by having the students recognize this work and to carry on what we do and fight for justice — it’s not a sprint.”
Environmental Law Society co-president and HLS student Christopher G. “Kipper” Berven said in a speech introducing Bullard that Bullard’s work has pushed environmental justice to the forefront of discussions in the field of environmental law.
“I think that we truly do have Dr. Bullard to thank for [environmental justice] now being much more widely recognized as a primary focus and a primary requirement for any discussion around environmental policymaking and environmental monitoring,” he said.
In remarks at the ceremony, HLS professor Richard J. Lazarus detailed his experiences with Bullard throughout his career in environmental law.
“In the last 30 years, there is no scholar who has had a greater impact, transformative impact, on environmental law and policy than Dr. Bullard,” he said. “Without question.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of Science Christopher W. Stubbs declined to comment on whether he is interested in succeeding University President-elect Claudine Gay as the next Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean, calling the position a very “demanding” role.
“I’m not going to engage in the palace intrigue dialogue,” Stubbs said in a Monday interview.
“I look forward to us entering a new era of leadership across the FAS and the University and working in partnership with whoever emerges as dean of FAS,” he added.
Harvard launched the search for the next FAS Dean in February after Gay’s appointment to University President was announced in December.
Describing the FAS Dean position as a “complicated, multifaceted, demanding role,” Stubbs said he hopes Gay’s successor will “help guide this community through the hard times and help Harvard become its best self.”
“There’s a very long list of opportunities, challenges, crises, leadership roles that that individual plays,” he said. “I wouldn’t try to boil it down to a couple of bullet points.”
School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Dean Francis J. Doyle III will also be stepping down from his post at the end of this academic year. In anticipation of his departure, Harvard kicked off the search for his successor in February.
Referencing a recent visit by the SEAS Dean search committee to the Sciences departmental chairs meeting, Stubbs said that “people like me tend to step away from those meetings so that the faculty can have a full-throated discussion with the search committee.”
When asked about foreign interference with research at Harvard, Stubbs said such interference should not be described as “academic espionage.”
“Harvard doesn’t do any classified research,” Stubbs said.
“The word ‘espionage’ implies spying. The word ‘spying’ implies stealing secrets. We don’t have a lot of secrets to steal,” he added. “So that phraseology has always struck me as inappropriate.”
Retired Harvard Chemistry Professor Charles M. Lieber was convicted of lying to federal authorities about his ties to a Chinese talent acquisition program in 2021. His conviction marked a high-profile victory for the Department of Justice’s China Initiative, which sought to combat academic espionage. The initiative was shut down in 2022 after years of criticism over its disproportionate impact on individuals of Chinese descent.
Stubbs said “overly simplistic categorizations” should be avoided in discussing Lieber’s legacy.
“Looking back historically, we certainly find countless examples of scientists who made significant intellectual contributions in some subfield of science, but maybe other elements of their either personal life or academic life had aspects that under our current historical lens, we view unfavorably,” he said.
Within his division, Stubbs said he is prioritizing building upon climate, quantum science and engineering, and cognition efforts while also continuing to “reinvigorate” the Sciences division’s core 10 departments.
Referring to ongoing residential building renovations at Harvard, Stubbs said he hopes to similarly renovate science buildings “at the building scale, rather than one faculty hiring at a time and renovating laboratories onesie twosie.”
“We’re looking hard at how we manage space and infrastructure for the scientific enterprise,” he said.
Stubbs added that he plans to configure a more “agile” and inclusive environment within his division.
“How can we sustain Harvard’s excellence, increase our level of inclusion and belonging, and be a magnet for the best people in the world to come here and do their best work?” he asked.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though Tuesday’s Harvard Kennedy School Student Government meeting ran an hour longer than scheduled, the body did not end up conducting the vote it originally set out to hold.
During the two-hour meeting, the KSSG originally aimed to discuss and vote on proposed bylaws that would restructure the executive board and move the elections of the president, executive vice president, vice president of finance, and vice president of elections from the fall to the start of the spring semester.
Instead, it became embroiled in tension, raised voices, accusations, and misunderstandings, ending with a motion to table the vote, an agreement to host more listening sessions, and no clear dates on when the original issues will be resolved.
Shared by KSSG President Sam Yoon on March 29, the proposed amendments aimed to avoid another controversial fall election and interim process like the one that took place in September 2022.
But opponents of the final proposal — both within KSSG and outside — said the amendments would prevent students pursuing a mid-career master’s in public administration, as well as other single-year students, from being able to vie for these positions.
Under the proposed bylaws, single year students — who begin their programs in the fall — would not be able to vote in the previous spring election for the president and vice president who would represent them during their time at the school. Some attendees said it is unfair for single year students to be unable to choose who represents them.
“It feels undemocratic and violates every principle of the ideals of democracy that we came here to absorb and learn,” HKS MC/MPA student Laura A. Cahill said.
Members of KSSG who volunteered to draft the new bylaws said in Tuesday’s meeting that this potential exclusion was an unintended consequence of an attempt to make KSSG more effective.
Lucy C.M. McSweeney, who helped draft the new bylaws, said, “there’s no intent to exclude.”
“The intention behind the change temporarily was just wanting to get more continuity and wanting to get more engagement because it’s challenging at the moment,” said McSweeney, the KSSG vice president of internal affairs, in an interview after the meeting.
Another concern raised by KSSG members and attendees was that the bylaw voting process seemed rushed, and students did not have enough time to represent their thoughts.
“They put out the recommendation pretty recently, and this is a very major change,” HKS MC/MPA student Sharon W. Lai said. “Maybe we should slow it back a little bit and involve more voices.”
KSSG Vice President of Finance Alexander R. Cooper, who also helped write the proposed bylaws, said the voting process needed to be short because no one ran for interim president or vice president. When current KSSG members’ terms end, there will be no student government if the bylaws do not pass.
“Where the urgency comes from is to say, ‘Come May, there will be no KSSG because our terms will end, and we won’t have identified a successor government,’” Cooper said.
Cooper also said that during the process of drafting the proposals, there was low engagement from other student representatives, adding his first time hearing most of the critiques was during the Tuesday meeting. Still, he said he appreciated that students were now taking part in the process.
“I’m glad that the outcome of this meeting is that there is more engagement,” Cooper said. “The reality was before today, there really hadn’t been that energy.”
“And so I’m glad that energy now exists, and I hope that we can take it and use it to deliver some meaningful change,” he added.
Vice President of Academic Affairs Enitan Oluwatobi Okediji said she shared her concerns with the authors of the bylaws before they were released to the student body, adding that she was surprised to see that they hadn’t changed by Tuesday’s meeting. Nevertheless, she said she didn’t consider the disagreements during the meeting as a failure of student government.
“What we did today was at the core of what engagement looks like,” she said. “I think it is on that basis that I would say that this was not necessarily a failure, but progress.”
Not everyone in attendance agreed.
“I view this meeting as a dumpster fire,” Cahill said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the past several seasons, alums of the Harvard men’s ice hockey program have emerged as  powerhouses of talent and production in the National Hockey League (NHL), with former Crimson stars Adam Fox, Ryan Donato, Alex Killorn, Jimmy Vesey, and others establishing themselves as key contributors for their respective teams.
Now, after Harvard’s 8-1 loss to the Ohio State Buckeyes on March 24th eliminated the Crimson from the 2023 NCAA Tournament, the next wave of Harvard talent is heading to the NHL.
Less than 24 hours after the Crimson’s loss, former captain Henry Thrun signed a two-year, entry-level contract with the San Jose Sharks, while former star forwards Sean Farrell and Matthew Coronato inked three-year deals with the Montreal Canadiens and Calgary Flames, respectively. Former goaltender Mitchell Gibson joined the Washington Capitals, while former standout Alex Laferriere is joining the Los Angeles Kings’ minor league team and former captain John Farinacci is considering joining the Arizona Coyotes.
Former forwards Baker Shore and Wyllum Deveaux have also signed minor league tryout deals in the ECHL.
HENRY THRUN
Thrun, a native of Southborough, Mass., co-captained Harvard to a stellar regular season in 2022-2023. After being named a Second Team All-American in 2021-2022, Thrun was recognized this season as the ECAC’s Best Defensive Defenseman, while putting up 31 points on offense (seven goals, 24 assists) to lead Crimson defensemen. A leader on and off the ice, Thrun also led the team in blocked shots with 40, and he was a staple on the left side of Harvard’s top defense pair, alongside fellow senior Ryan Siedem.
A fourth-round draft pick of the Anaheim Ducks in 2019, Thrun’s NHL rights were traded to the Sharks on February 28th after he indicated that he intended to test free agency instead of signing with the Ducks. Thrun joins a Sharks squad stuck at the bottom of the NHL standings, but San Jose is 2-0-1 since his debut, and Thrun recorded two assists in his first game, an overtime victory on March 30 against the Vegas Golden Knights.
“Obviously, I was a little nervous, a couple [of] butterflies there, but a lot of really welcoming guys in the room,” Thrun told NBC Sports California after his debut.
MITCHELL GIBSON
Gibson, hailing from Phoenixville, Pa., posted a brilliant season in his final campaign in Cambridge, earning a berth on the All-ECAC Second Team with a 2.25 goals-against average and a .919 save percentage. After taking over as the starter last season in his junior campaign, Gibson was a consistent and often dominant presence between the pipes for the Crimson, and he posted some of his best performances in Harvard’s biggest games. This season, he notched 45 saves in the Beanpot semifinal against Boston College, posted a shutout against Cornell in an overtime victory in the ECAC semifinals, and made 35 saves in a heavyweight battle with Michigan in November. Gibson was drafted in the fourth round in 2018 by the Washington Capitals, and he has signed an amateur tryout (ATO) to join the Capitals organization, and he was summoned to the NHL on April 2nd to serve as the Capitals’ backup goalie after Washington’s backup was unavailable due to illness.
ALEX LAFERRIERE
Laferriere led the Crimson in goal scoring in 2022-2023 with 21 as part of a stellar junior season. After earning ECAC Hockey Rookie of the Year Honors last season in his sophomore campaign (his first with Harvard due to Ivy League’s cancellation of the 2020-2021 season), Laferriere emerged as a dynamic goal-scoring threat and an engine of the Crimson’s second line. A N.J. native and childhood teammate of Farinacci and sophomore forward Alex Gaffney, Laferriere scored five goals across Harvard’s four-game ECAC tournament run, including the overtime winner in the semifinals against Cornell. Drafted in the third round in 2020 by the Los Angeles Kings, Laferriere agreed to an amateur tryout (ATO) with the Ontario Reign, the Kings’ minor league affiliate.
“It definitely took a couple [of] shifts to get used to it, my first shift an unlucky bounce off my skate and it's in the back of our net, so definitely not a good start,” said Laferriere in an interview with the Reign’s official website after his first game. “I think after I got a couple shifts under me, I felt good out there. Definitely a lot more physical, but I felt good.”
SEAN FARRELL
After an incredible second season in crimson, junior Farrell was named one of the top 10 finalists for the Hobey Baker Award, the most prestigious award in college hockey, which has been awarded to four Harvard alums: Mark Fusco ‘83, Scott Fusco ‘86, Lane MacDonald ‘89, and Jimmy Vesey ‘16. Named the ECAC Hockey and Ivy League Player of the Year, Farrell led the team in scoring, posting 53 points (20 goals, 33 assists) in 34 games, and he finished second in the country in points per game (1.56). He was the team’s top left wing, playing alongside Coronato and sophomore Zakary Karpa with the team at full strength. Farrell and Coronato, who previously played together in junior hockey for the USHL’s Chicago Steel, had elite chemistry on the ice. Farrell surpassed the 50-point mark in the ECAC quarterfinals against Princeton on March 11th, becoming just the third player in Harvard hockey history to reach the mark. Hailing from Hopkinton, Mass., Farrell grew up playing with and against teammate Thrun, and he was drafted in the fourth round of the 2020 NHL Draft, 124th overall, by the Montreal Canadiens — one of the NHL’s Original Six. Farrell officially signed a three-year entry-level contract on Sunday, March 26th, choosing the professional route instead of his senior year at Harvard. Farrell made his NHL debut on Tuesday, March 28th against the Philadelphia Flyers, and he recorded his first goal in his second game, scoring in the first two minutes of the Canadiens’ March 30 game against the Florida Panthers.
“Obviously an offensive talent, dynamic player. Not a big guy, but he's able to attack between checks and stuff,” said Canadiens head coach Martin St. Louis at a press conference before Farrell’s debut. “He's done it at every level. And this is a level that he's gonna have to show that he can still do it.”
MATTHEW CORONATO:
Sophomore forward Coronato was perhaps the most clutch player on Harvard’s roster this season, scoring overtime winners against Yale and Colgate, a late game-tying goal against Princeton, as well as four goals during the Beanpot Tournament. After a stellar freshman year, Coronato matched his point total of 34 (20 goals, 14 assists) while continuing to perform well under the bright lights after he scored the overtime winner in last season’s ECAC title game. Named to this year’s All-Ivy First Team and All-ECAC Second Team, the Greenlawn, N.Y. native signed a three-year entry-level contract with the Calgary Flames on March 26th, foregoing his final two years of college eligibility. Coronato was the Flames’ first-round pick in the 2021 NHL Draft as the 13th overall pick – the highest draft pick in Harvard Hockey history. Coronato is yet to make his debut but will have a chance to do so in some critical games as the Flames battle for a playoff spot.
“It’s been a little crazy, it’s been really exciting, just hard to explain the feeling of being here,” said Coronato at a press conference after his first practice. “Really just grateful for the opportunity to come in and be here with these guys and learn.”
JOHN FARINACCI:
In his last year at Harvard, co-captain Farinacci was sidelined due to an upper-body injury for the first half of the season, lacing up for the first time against Clarkson University on January 13th. Upon his return, the Red Bank, N.J. native joined childhood teammate Laferriere on the second line at center and tallied five goals and 15 assists, combining for 20 points in 19 games. Farinacci has been a consistent producer during his time in Cambridge, recording 19 points last year and 20 in his freshman season in 2019-20. Farinacci played for Team USA in the 2021 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, tallying five goals and two assists in Team USA’s gold medal run. Farinacci was drafted in the third round of the 2019 NHL Draft by the Arizona Coyotes, 76th overall, and the Coyotes will retain Farinacci’s NHL rights until August 15th. If he doesn’t sign before then, Farinacci can become a free agent and would be free to sign with any team in the NHL.
