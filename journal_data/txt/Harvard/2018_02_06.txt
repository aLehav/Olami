After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first scene of “Cute Little Buggers” makes the film’s aim clear. There are just-realistic-enough aliens and a cheesy romance in the woods. There’s also an overly gory attack by aliens—one that accurately foreshadows the rest of the campy horror-comedy. Ultimately, the film is a cringeworthy, ham-fisted attempt to revive the over-the-top charm of 20th century B-movies. It’s one that ultimately fails in large part due to the sheer unlikeability of its characters.

“Cute Little Buggers” has a dual plot. The first storyline revolves around a pair of inept and ill-meaning aliens, intent on abducting as many human women as possible from a quaint town in the British countryside in order to forcibly reproduce and keep their alien species alive. They carry out this devious plan by possessing the “Cute Little Buggers” for which the movie is named: a squadron of evil, tentacle-wielding bunnies. The second plot line depicts the return of a “prodigal son” to the very same quaint British town, and the romantic and familial revelations that come with his arrival. The two storylines are deeply uneven in importance, and so the movie strangely rotates with plot twists as the aliens’ plan dwarfs the human relationships, even as the two stories intersect.
One common feature of both plotlines is its shameless and excessive reliance on gender stereotypes for the purposes of comedy and character development. In fact, perhaps the most frequently recurring comedic device used is the ill-timed abduction of topless women, all of whom remain scantily clad and desperate for their designated male savior. Meanwhile, the men are bumbling stereotypes, fixated on both figurative and literal pissing contests while fighting over their claims on various women. The characters are predictable, unoriginal, and overwhelmingly one-dimensional.
Additionally, the actors’ interpretation of their characters do little to redeem the film. The acting is stiff—though the actors’ voices sometimes convey a few hints of emotional range, their faces more often reflect either solemn rage or unbridled hysteria, depending entirely on the character’s gender. Ironically, the aliens are the most relatable characters in the movie. Their banter is occasionally natural and sometimes even genuinely amusing in its ridiculousness. Despite their strange, unearthly, deeply unconvincing alien masks, they are certainly more sympathetic than the uninteresting and frankly irritating humans. At best, the humans' comedy is shaky. At worst, it is horrifyingly tasteless, as evidenced when a monotone member of the all-white cast cracks a blunt joke about hunting indigenous people.
Reflecting the plot’s strange two-part structure, the cinematography of “Cute Little Buggers” lurches between two distinct settings. The first is reminiscent of a jump-scare horror movie, replete with poor CGI and shaky, red-tinted camera shots. The second is as simple, old-world and down-to-earth as the town itself. The camerawork is simple, relying on broad still shots to highlight the rural features of the town, from the bales of hay to the tractors to the folk concert. Unfortunately, the transition quality between these two styles is inconsistent. Sometimes, the juxtaposition provides just the right balance of the two sensibilities to keep the viewer alert—at other times, the viewer risks whiplash from the quick and confusing transition.
“Cute Little Buggers” has many of the features of a traditional B movie. The acting, dialogue, and plot are all cheesy to the extreme. The purpose is entertainment, but the direction is not artistic to fulfill that goal. The film is certainly low-budget. However, it simply lacks the genuine humor and fun that earned B movies of the past their audience, largely because the characters are unlikeable, dull, and often annoying. Viewers looking for a goofy, not-too-deep movie to occupy a slow evening ought to look elsewhere, simply because “Cute Little Buggers” is not endearing enough to justify its less admirable qualities.

Lighthearted and comical, the Harvard College Opera’s production of Strauss’ operetta “Die Fledermaus” opened on Wednesday, Jan. 31, with an outstanding orchestra and charming characters. The operetta, which translates to “The Bat,” featured iconic music by Johann Strauss II, a member of the Austrian music power family, and a German libretto by Karl Haffner and Richard Genée.
The orchestra was a definite strong suit for the production. Conducted by Alexander “Sasha” Yakub ’20,  who also served as music director of the production, the ensemble rang in the overture with beautiful tones and a firm presence, even though it was comprised of only 28 musicians.
The story is divided into three acts surrounding the mischief and troubles of Gabriel von Eisenstein (Ethan Craigo) and those around him. His wife, Rosalinde (Veronica Richer), is miserable after finding out that he’s been sentenced to eight days in jail for disobeying a police officer and must begin his term that night. Rosalinde’s old love Alfred (Samuel Rosner)—who never quite got over her—takes her husband’s absence as an opportunity to try to woo her back to him. Meanwhile, Rosalinde’s chambermaid, Adele (Arianna Paz), dreams of attending a grand New Year’s Eve party thrown by the glamorous Prince Orlofsy (Benjamin P. Wenzelberg) that her sister Ida (Nivi Ravi) invited her to that night. As each one of these characters laments over their own inability to attend the party, Eisenstein’s friend Dr. Falke (Oliver Berliner) sets them up to attend in disguise.
Rosalinde’s love for Alfred seemed sincere yet confusing. Even though she resisted his advances at first, she was shallow enough to be wooed by his voice and passionate serenades. Her exaggerated performance clearly revealed her emotional character while keeping with the humour of the rest of the operetta. Adele sulked in her lowly position as a chambermaid with a mediocre performance in the first act, but her vocals shone through in the second act, when she posed as an actress named “Olga.” In “Mein Herr Marquis”/“My Lord Marquis,” Adele scoffed at the idea of Eisenstein recognizing her as the chambermaid and revealed her vulnerability, uncertainty, and bewilderment in a touching moment.
Eisenstein, on the other hand,  was a rather unlikeable character, with his insincerity to his wife and his lustful eyes for other women. His duet with Dr. Falke, “Kommt Mit Mir Zum Souper”/“Come With Me To the Souper,” was especially engaging and reflective of Eisenstein’s character, as he got literally entangled in Dr. Falke’s telephone cord on stage in a clever section of choreography. Police officer Frank (Luke Minton), who was supposed to arrest Eisenstein, unknowingly ended up meeting him at the party. Frank walked around in an unmistakable chicken suit and SWAT jacket, bringing laughs to the stage by acting exactly as a police officer should not.
Given the smaller size of the stage, the chaotic office setting in the opening background looked cluttered and distracting. Even though the modernization of the whole party and ball scene increased the accessibility and relatability of the operetta, some of the details were overly accented. The party set was too sparkly, and the costumes took attention away from the plotline itself. If the point was to overwhelm with color and showiness, then the set hit the spot. In highlighting the characters against the background, the sets strayed away from its purpose. Ironically, the sultry set of the gloomy jail scene in the third act was far less overwhelming and aesthetically pleasing.
The props, on the other hand, were craftily intertwined in the storyline. For example, Rosner’s Alfred hid under a trash can umbrella hat, perfectly blending into the background so much that his reentrance, usually announced by a beautifully vocalized melodic interruption, was delightfully surprising. If nothing else, the amount of time that Alfred spent on stage hidden in the trash can was impressive.
Interjected with English narrations by English Professor Gordon Teskey and acting parts in English, “Die Fledermaus” was an engaging and accessible show for the contemporary college student. With this revival, the Harvard College Opera proved that a true comedy can still bring about laughs and lighten up spirits 144 years after its premiere.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the temperature outside dipped below the thirties, sweet scents of liege waffles and a warming light radiated from 40 Bow Street, as Blue Bottle Coffee opened its doors in Cambridge for the first time. Students lined up by the West Coast giant’s entrance, eager for their Friday caffeine fix. The Crimson went to the scene to check out what Blue Bottle Coffee has to offer.
New Orleans CoffeeThe coffee menu seems standard at first glance—espresso, cold brew, lattes, drip coffee. Blue Bottle has its own twists on these classics, like the delightful New Orleans cold brew, served with milk, cane sugar, and roasted chicory. The iced drink is smooth and sweet, creamy but not too rich. It’s the perfect way to ease into the morning for anyone who’s not used to or ready to be hit with the bitter and oftentimes sour taste of HUDS coffee—a wake-up call that’s gentle, soothing and effective.

Latte For a warmer drink, try the latte, just as comforting. The latte art is beautiful, and the light and not overly airy microfoam is the star of this drink. I found the espresso a bit underwhelming and too diluted, though I’d be willing to give it another shot on its own instead of with steamed milk.

Liege Waffle Move over, Zinneken’s. You no longer have the monopoly to waffles in the square. The liege waffle, which CEO Bryan K. Meehan called the “star” of the menu, upstaged the rest of the selections. A crunchy and sugar-sweet crust falls apart to a soft and chewy center. It’s definitely a satisfying bite. The size is perfect for a breakfast to-go or a daytime snack. There’s something about the fresh and lightly sweet pastry that makes me feel like it’d be okay to have one of these waffles everyday. Maybe it’s not that bad for me. Or maybe it’s just that good.

Avocado Toast And, of course, Blue Bottle Coffee wouldn’t really be a west coast joint if it didn’t offer avocado toast. A thick slice of hearty multigrain bread serves as the base for a heap of avocado goodness. The spicy pepper flakes and lemon juice sprinkled on top add an amazing kick to this millenial classic, and the dish is dense and filling despite its portable size. However, it costs $9. Would I buy this? Not everyday. But if I’m treating myself? Definitely.

Spearmint Herbal Tea For those looking for a non-caffeinated drink, the coffee shop offers decaf coffee as well as teas. I tried the spearmint herbal tea, which was at once soothing and refreshing, but nothing to boast about. If I really wanted tea, TeaLuxe is still my place of choice.
The AmbienceEven as students weaved in and out of Blue Bottle, tables across the cafe filled up. Meehan emphasized “hospitality” as one of the key values of the company, and the layout inside provides a space for social gatherings with the ambience of a true coffeehouse. Against one side of the store, a countertop lines the window, creating a whole row of space conducive to working. The minimalist design and plain white walls highlight the store’s interior, much like its year-old competitor Tatte, located a little more than a block down the street. However, where Tatte tries to be elegant with a vintage aesthetic, Blue Bottle tries to be contemporary.
The menu also includes in-house English muffins and dairy-free overnight oats, as well as grab-and-go sandwiches and pastries. Blue Bottle offered a cup of free coffee to customers stopping by between 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on its opening day. Regular business hours will be between 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.

It was like stepping off the edge of the world, to be an artist,” Pauline B. Lim ’88 said. We were in her home at the Brickbottom Artists Association in Somerville, Massachusetts. The first thing you might have noticed about her place was that there was no free space on her walls. They were decked out in the mixed-media paintings she sells, from the floor to the ceiling.
“Right after graduation I spent several years in a state of terror,” Lim said. “What was going to happen to me? How am I going to make money? Am I going to have to be a prostitute?”
Three decades later and Lim is living in a very different picture. She sustains herself through her paintings and a day job, and lives in an artist’s space with dozens of creators.
But when Lim graduated in 1988 with a degree in Visual and Environmental Studies, there seemed to be a myriad of voices telling her that she was on the wrong path: negative stereotypes about artists from popular culture, the ever-heightening standard of being a Harvard student, and disapproving parents.
“My dad was a doctor, and my mom’s father was a doctor, and my mom was an RN [registered nurse],” Lim said. “And they were refugees from Korea after the Korean War. And they were constantly telling me I had to be a doctor in order to survive.”
“Everyone at Harvard was going on to be a consultant or going to law school or medical school or business school,” she added. “And I felt so alone.”
In the past four years, around 5 percent of each Harvard graduating class has gone on to pursue a career in the arts according to The Crimson’s annual senior survey. Some alumni go on to make it big—take Matt P. Damon ’92, Damien S. Chazelle ’07, or Rashida L. Jones ’97. Others, who may not achieve international fame, still find their own places within their respective fields.
The term “artist” is broad. For this piece, I interviewed dancers, writers, a theater set designer, a painter, musicians, comedians, and an actor. And while there is no “one path,” as many have mentioned, there are a few common threads that appear throughout this massive, ever-expanding network of Harvard’s artists.
It’s not always an easy decision to make. And for Soman S. Chainani ’01, it wasn’t much of a decision at all. Chainani is the author of the children's book trilogy “The School for Good and Evil” and currently has a film deal with Universal Pictures for the novels. But after graduating with an English degree, Chainani didn’t head straight into an arts career. He went into consulting instead.
“I got fired after 18 months,” Chainani said. “Just for being so useless because I hated the job so much.”
Getting fired was a sign for Chainani to change career paths—he went on to earn his MFA in film at Columbia University, worked in film-writing, and eventually took up the work of a novelist.
“I think sometimes that’s important for artists to realize that you think you have a backup plan which is ‘Oh I’m just gonna go and make a ton of money the usual way.’ And then there are some of us who just can’t,” Chainani said. “We are going to get found out.”
That’s what happened with the consulting job, Chainani said. “They figured out I didn’t belong there.”
But the idea of “belonging” in the arts industry raises a question of ideology. Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter Forrest O’Connor ’10 said you have to ask yourself, “Do I have something that people will want, and that’s filling a void?”
He also said that with the advent of social media, the industry may be becoming overpopulated with people pursuing nontraditional ways to artistic popularity.
“It’s a competitive landscape. In any job or in any industry it will be, but especially with the arts,” O’Connor said. “It’s so flooded and the money really isn’t.”
Where your family stands financially may also complicate the picture. In a 2016 interview, Robin E. Kelsey—the Dean of the Arts and Humanities Division of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—said that students who come from economically insecure families may feel the pressure to pursue studies that have clearer professional paths. Suzannah E. Clark—chair of the Music Department—agreed in another 2016 interview.
“No matter what one’s race or identity, [if one is] either a first-generation college student or economically disadvantaged or on financial aid, there can be pressures to think about how one can use one’s degree later for employment,” Clark said. “Sometimes people worry that the arts and humanities don’t necessarily lead to the most obvious jobs afterwards.”
Robin Mount—the director of Career, Research, and International Opportunities Office of Career Services—said her own experiences advising students reflects Clark’s statement.
“There are students who come in, and despite what they would really love to do, they say ‘It’s my turn now to support my siblings or my family and that’s my obligation, and that needs to be my number one priority,’” she said. “And that’s totally fine.”
Some students can still take the plunge despite financial concerns, which is what actor Meagan A. Michelson ’10 did. Michelson said she was on substantial financial aid when she arrived at Harvard.
“Is it harder to go into arts when you don’t come from money? Yeah—if you don’t have a trust fund, and you’re the one primarily paying your rent,” Michelson said. “But you make it work.”
In 2016—according to The Crimson’s annual senior survey—only 4 percent of the graduating class indicated that they would be going into the arts after graduation. But the number nearly triples when students are asked what career they see themselves in after ten years. While daunting, these years could be the perfect time to establish oneself in an industry.
“Those first couple of years are the toughest,” Mount said. “But they’re also the time when you don’t have any dependence, you don’t have a mortgage, you don’t have kids.”
There are certain advantages that going to Harvard offers: grants, fellowships, alumni connections, and the numerous advisers willing to help. I met with three advisors at OCS: Mount, Gail E. Gilmore, Assistant Director of Arts Management, and Deb Carroll, Associate Director of Employer Relations and Operations. They immediately peppered me with questions about what I’m doing next summer, eager to assist me even outside of our interview. After sitting down, the three handed me flyers and booklets with lists of programmings and resources offered by both the OCS and the Office for the Arts.
“I think a myth is that some careers are easy and some careers are hard,” Mount said. “They’re all hard.”
There are arts-specific fellowships and grants that can encourage Harvard students to pursue the arts—like the Artist Development Fellowships or the Dmitri Hadzi Visual Arts Grant.
There’s also Harvardwood: a nonprofit organization that offers a job board, a Wintersession entertainment industry boot-camp in Los Angeles, and an alumni network to Harvard students interested in the arts. OCS pays the annual $45 membership to Harvardwood for Faculty of Arts and Sciences students, regardless of financial need. Mount, Gilmore, and Carroll also emphasize that networking can be a valuable resource.
“I think that sometimes students don’t like the networking idea because they think it’s all about getting people to do things for them,” Carroll said. “But really, it’s a mutual relationship…. People want to give, especially when they know how their sector or industry works. They want to help.”
“Ben Franklin talked a lot about paying it forward,” Mount added.
Alumni connections can be useful in unexpected ways. In Lim’s first years after graduation, she wound up moving into an unsafe building, something she described as a “drug house” in retrospect. She didn’t know what to do until she saw a billboard advertising Brickbottom, called their number, and found herself talking to a fellow Harvard alumnus, who immediately helped her get settled into her future home.
Devon M. Guinn ’17 found his connection to Harvard useful for supplementing his income that would otherwise consist of holding beatboxing workshops and private lessons.
“This summer I had a fellowship to make a text-adventure about one of the libraries at Harvard,” he said. “From the fellowship, I’m now an outreach person for the library.”
But not everyone finds these resources helpful. While Karen Chee ’17 participated in Harvardwood 101’s winter break program, she found her own research and Harvard’s liberal arts education to be more useful when thinking about her career in comedy.
“Because it was a liberal arts education, I got to take a journalism class with Jill Abramson,” Chee said. She added that because the course taught her how to be a more economical writer, it helped her strengthen her comedy skills as well. “... I would honestly say my journalism class helped me with writing jokes.”
Michelson said that her English concentration allowed her to think in a more “unusual and creative perspective,” something that fed into her approach with writing cabaret scripts.
Mount described another incident, in which a student was deciding between Harvard and a performing arts school.
“The faculty told her ‘Absolutely not. Go to Harvard,’” Mount said. “... You’ll never have that experience to grow your mind and learn about so many things that you’ll need to call on when you play different roles.”
“So many actors and writers too have said that to me—that they’re really glad they came here for that exact reason,” Gilmore added.
Not all working artists will have the same challenges or benefits. Musicians may find that they have to travel and tour extensively. Dancers may find that their work requires physical preparedness. But a common theme with jobs in the arts is that finances can be tricky; this is when a second job can come in handy.
“Get an easy-going, stable job, at the institutions that give you benefits,” Lim said. “The more routine the job, the better. It is so relaxing.”
There’s also a certain Harvard privilege that helps out when trying to find second jobs, Michelson said. Once, while Michelson was on tour, her castmate found her editing a college essay as part of her second job.
“You’re so lucky that that’s your part-time work. Actors that didn’t go to Harvard have to wait tables,” the castmate said. “You get to do editing work on your computer. You just have so much more flexibility because people trust you with that kind of work.”
Aside from second jobs, there are other tips and tricks that alumni have shared with me on ways to save. Devi K. Lockwood ’14 is a poet, storyteller, and avid cyclist who travels around the country collecting recordings of people’s experiences with water and climate change. She relies on applying to numerous grants or fellowships to fund her work. In fact, it was a Gardner & Shaw Postgraduate Traveling Fellowship from Harvard that gave Lockwood her start. She used the $22,000 to fund a year of travels to places like Fiji, New Zealand, and Australia.
“Sometimes it’s 99 no’s for every yes,” Lockwood said about grant applications.
Rossi L. Walter ’14, who used to dance while living in San Francisco, remembered the food habits he developed in response to his times as a ‘poor’ dance student in an expensive city. He recommended constantly having a lunch box to avoid spending too much money on food—especially if you’re hungry in between practice. “I’m constantly carrying food around in my bag: nuts, carrots, fruit, little sandwiches that I make.”
He also recommended removing other counterproductive habits like buying expensive coffee or cigarettes. “Really just try to crack down on those habits, at least for a short period of time,” Walter said. “Make your own damn coffee.”
Lim’s growing worries about living as an artist eventually pushed her to see a therapist. In her sessions, Lim said she kept repeating a particular phrase: “I have to be a great artist. I have to be a great artist.”
“Why can’t you just say ‘I want to be an artist?’” her therapist asked.
But this didn’t seem like an option. To Lim, at the time, it seemed like a waste of a Harvard degree if she didn’t achieve some high level of fame and success. “Why bother?” she thought.
“No wonder why I was such a mess.” Lim laughs about the situation now. “There’s such a thing as being a ‘moderate, mediocre artist’ or whatever. It doesn’t matter. I don’t think it’s healthy going around thinking ‘I have to be a genius! I have to be a genius!’”
Elizabeth Mak ’12, a freelance theater designer, found that the irregular schedule of her profession contributed to dropping self-esteem.
“There are periods of intense work, and then there are periods of no work,” Mak said. “So you go from being tired all the time to feeling really insecure and really useless in the span of a week.”
“Its hard, because your friends are all making a lot of money,” Chainani said. “They’re all rising, and you’re still getting your project off the ground.”
“When you go to Harvard, there’s so much expectation that you be earth-shattering and world-changing,” Lim said. But sometimes it’s better to live a quiet, comfortable life, she said. Looking back, Lim realized that she was never going to be happy in a life of international fame or wild success.
“There are other ways to be wealthy,” Lim said.
An artist’s life isn’t always glamorous, as Lim pointed out. O’Connor found this to be especially true during open mics, when he was trying to gain publicity as a musician.
“Especially during the winter, it’s a lot of slogging through deep snow, trying to warm up… waiting three hours and going on for two songs. Half the crowd is drunk,” O’Connor said. But a love for the art is his reason for staying.
“It’s sort of in my head all the time. I love moving people with [music]. I love the inspiration I receive from my favorite musicians and players. I know that these are some of the most important moments in my life.”
“You have to just really want to do what you’re doing,” says Mount. “That’s what gets you through those days that are terrible.”
Lim took me on a tour of Brickbottom after our interview. “This building is full of older and mid-career artists who have had productive lives,” she said. We said hello to the artists who passed by, stopped to pet a filmmaker’s dog, and hunted for empty wall space to hang paintings—a rare commodity in an artist’s home.
For Lim, choosing arts worked out. But sometimes people might find that another career suits them better. Pianist Berenika D. Zakrzewski ’04, whose Wikipedia page describes her as “a child prodigy,” used to tour around the world with her music. She later moved on to managing cultural programs as the Executive Director of Casa Romantica Cultural Center and Gardens. Lara M. Hirner ’04 acted similarly, moving from singing to a career as a speech pathologist. Emily R. Pollock ’06 opted for a more academic route, becoming an Associate Professor of Music at MIT. And just because you pursue a different career doesn’t mean you can’t involve yourself in the arts ever again—Hirner still occasionally sings for paid jobs.
But sometimes the only choice is to stay. Michelson remembers the night she realized she needed to be an actress. She was watching “A Little Night Music” on Broadway. Bernadette Peters was singing “Send in the Clowns,” and for some reason, Michelson started crying.
“For the next 48 hours I was nauseated, I was just ill. And I had to look inside of myself and ask what the heck was going on,” she said. “The only thing that would make me 100 percent happy is going for it as an actor.”
“Be fearless,” Michelson said. “Because fortunately, with a degree from Harvard, you have assets. You have skills that are going to make things a little easier for you to find those second and third jobs to help you do what you really love.”
“And it’s going to be tiring—you’re going to have to have multiple jobs and wear multiple hats to make it work,” she added. “But why not? You got to Harvard. You’re used to multitasking.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Los Angeles-based indie folk band Magic Giant recently released a video for the second single “Window” off of their debut album “In the Wind.” The Crimson spoke with frontman Austin P. Bisnow about the band’s beginnings, message, and future.
The Harvard Crimson: What’s the “Magic Giant” origin story? Additionally, was there a moment when you guys were playing together and it all clicked?
Austin P. Bisnow: So, [multi-instrumentalist] Zambricki [Li] and I coincidentally both moved to Los Angeles in 2011, and we both coincidentally had the dream to start a band. We were both doing separate things in music, but not performing really. We both had the same New Year’s Resolution [to start performing]. I was trying to jam with everyone I could to try to manifest this New Year’s Resolution, getting intros, meeting people.
I was really drawn to folk music at the time—kinda like an influx of folk came into my life. I was asking my friends, “Hey, do you know any banjo players, any fiddle players, anyone who can play the mandolin?” One guy told me he knows someone that can do them all. He introduced us and the rest is history for me and Zambricki.
So, Zambricki and I went on hiatus. We were doing our own things again. Our old band was very poppy, just for fun, very part-time. And someone who had seen one of those early shows hit me up and asked if we wanted to play the “Sweet Life” festival in D.C. I instinctively said, “Yes!” and I called Zambricki and said “We’re getting the band back together!” Shortly after, we met Zang playing at a club. Afterwards we looked him up and saw some videos of him salsa dancing. That was really the catalyst.
The first show we ever played as Magic Giant I knew we had something special. Just by word of mouth, the first show was sold-out with a hundred people who couldn’t get in. No one expected that. There was a moment on stage where I cried because so many people were showering us with love singing our music. I think the pivotal moment for us was [multi-instrumentalist] Zang joining because he balances Zambricki and me in such a seamless way. It was like the puzzle clicked together.
THC: What are the main emotions you channel when you’re performing your music, and overall what sort of experience do you want for someone at a Magic Giant concert?
APB: If I had to give one word it would be “joy,” or maybe “catharsis.” Really, just releasing whatever you need and winding up at a place of joy and fulfilment. Something that can touch people, that they can take with them and pass on, pay it forward.
Another huge theme in our music is the power of the human will. We’re not just happy for happy’s sake. It’s intentional that we know the world is crazy and there are really hard, horrible things happening. Yeah, life is tough, but we can either stay in that place, or either have an outlook or do something to brighten it just the littlest bit.
THC: The song and the video for “Window,” your new single, really speaks to that.
APB: Yeah, totally. The whole concept of the “Window” video is loosely inspired by Rapunzel. A girl got in a fight with her dad and we try to go save the day. And the keyword there is “try,” because there are all these little challenges for us to even get there and make it to her physically, mentally, and emotionally to try and brighten her day. That’s our goal.
THC: What artists have had an influence on you and the music of Magic Giant?
APB: Bruce Springsteen has been a big one for us just for his live show energy and longevity of career. Queen, for their fearlessness to do the craziest productions in a modern style, in a digestible way that can get to the masses, and in taking turns that you can never see coming.
THC: What can fans expect from Magic Giant in the future?
APB: Woo! We just announced a tour going from Jan. 23 until March. I hope we’re coming back to Europe this spring and summer. We’re gonna be playing a bunch of festivals, and probably be releasing some more videos. We’re working on a documentary for the making of our album “In the Wind,” just a little short something. This winter tour is really exciting, and we’re calling it “The Magic Misfits Tour.” We’re coming to Boston on Feb. 16 at Brighton Music Hall.

In her newest novel, “An American Marriage,” Tayari Jones explores black experiences in the present day South. One year after Roy and Celestial marry, Roy is wrongfully incarcerated and sentenced to twelve years in prison. The couple’s past problems only further stress the couple’s marriage, which is already under intense strain. Roy and Celestial must grapple with issues within their family, face the implications of coming from different socioeconomic statuses, and redefine what love and marriage means to them. But most importantly, they must confront what it means to be black in the South. Jones creates a beautifully sad story that will invariably lead to an emotional hangover.
While so much of Southern literature takes place during the Civil War or Antebellum period, Jones places her story in the new South—the South as it is now rather than one hundred years ago. This is a more interesting setting as people try to reconcile the South’s ugly past with its place in America now. Jones portrays the South as a place of growth as Celestial opens a shop within a predominantly white area, without glossing over its problematic aspects such as Southern judges giving harsher sentences to black people. She also distinguishes between the many different areas of the South. The city of Atlanta is quite different from the back roads of Louisiana, and Jones makes this apparent. “An American Marriage” explores the dynamic of a small southern town, as well as a southern city that has a large black population. The novel provides a beautiful mixture of both the past and the present along with the country and the city, showing the diversity of setting in the South.
Jones’ writing style is filled with maxims that speak universal and personal truths. The novel even begins with one: “There are two kinds of people in the world, those who leave home, and those who don’t.” Others address marriage:  “Marriage is between two people. There is no studio audience.” Some of these words of wisdom come from the main characters’ parents, but some are the protagonists’ inner thoughts as they untangle their messy lives. The certainty imbued in these words drives them home in a way that can only be done with such blunt statements.
Jones doesn’t shy away from addressing black stereotypes but makes sure they do not define her characters. The father of Celestial’s neighbor, Andre, left him when he was a child, but instead of falling into a trope, he acknowledges the danger of the stereotype, refusing to be “like some kind of tragic black man who grew up without a daddy and is warped for life.” But he also recognizes that these hardships are his own, and that they shape his beliefs and make him a stronger person who “don’t believe that blood makes a family; kin is the circle you create, hands held tight.”
The entirety of the novel centers around Roy’s incarceration, which happens because he was “the wrong race at the wrong time.” There is so much emotion to unpack—heartbreak, loss, lust, and love all play major roles—and Jones takes her reader on the rollercoaster ride. Through letters—both answered and unanswered—long car rides between country house and home in the city, and meetings in the jail’s visitor’s center, Roy and Celestial’s relationship can be described as beautiful, messy, tragic and broken. Short sentences can convey worlds of emotion, and when Celestial decides not to keep the child she is pregnant with she laments that, “My body apparently was fertile soil, but my life was not.” While so much of the novel brings up immense questions about race in America, the strongest part of the story is the way Jones so intensely conveys emotion.
“An American Marriage” deals with important issues in a setting well-suited for such discussion. However, the novel’s serious nature does not make it dry. Jones takes the topics and injects intense emotion into them, creating a narrative that is difficult to put down.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Wednesday, a group of Harvard affiliates gathered outside University President Drew G. Faust’s office to deliver a petition calling on her to support Temporary Protected Status recipients. TPS grants work permits and other benefits to immigrants from countries deemed temporarily unsafe due to catastrophes, including armed conflict and natural disasters. Over the last few months, the Trump administration has terminated the for program for citizens from countries like El Salvador, Haiti, and Nicaragua, paving the way for many immigrants previously protected by the program to be deported.
We recognize the value of all individuals at Harvard. TPS is an issue that affects the entire country and world. But more locally, we have TPS recipients right here at Harvard. And so just as Faust has shown continuous support for undocumented students, she should show support for TPS recipients as well. Threats to TPS are also threats to student well-being, as Harvard students may have family members who are TPS recipients. These struggles are interconnected, and Faust must take a consistent policy stance on supporting immigrant members of the Harvard community.
Supporting Harvard employees and students affected by TPS will go a long way toward fulfilling the charge of the Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging. Harvard TPS workers have built their entire lives here in America, and in this case, at Harvard. Many workers have lived in this country longer than the U.S.-born students that attend the University, as conflicts in their home countries have raged on for decades. They have children, homes, and jobs here. They too are Harvard, and deserve as much, if not more, support from the University as any other member of this community.
By staying silent, Faust is not showing support for the notion that TPS recipients are as worthy of the same protections as the undocumented students she supports. We reject this silence and ask that Faust show solidarity with all members of Harvard.
Indeed, we recognize the importance of all Harvard affiliates, not solely as workers  or students, but as a collective whole, working to protect each other. We see evidence of this in Harvard students' support for the Harvard University Dining Services strike in 2016, as well as some Adams House dining workers’ display of support for BGLTQ students in 2009.
Members of our community are at risk of losing the lives they’ve built in the United States by being sent back to dangerous countries they no longer know. They are forced to make emergency plans to prepare for the real danger of being deported and having their families separated. They prepare for the possibility of losing their jobs as soon as their TPS expires. Their time is running out. Faust has an obligation to Harvard. We urge her to be on the right side of history by following the demands made in the petition.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s high time we admitted that Facebook and Twitter are pernicious technologies. Those who doubt this haven’t taken stock of the last two years.
In Jan. 2018, an online firestorm broke out after social media users circulated a sound bite from Psychology professor Steven A. Pinker, in which he referred to the “highly literate, highly intelligent” alt-right.  Though Pinker hardly intended flattery, he drew fire from the left as the “darling” of racists, while the far-right quickly made him out as a liberal, Jewish Uncle Tom.
Last August, Professor Kyle P. Quinn at the University of Arkansas and his wife began to fear for their safety when Twitter users, believing him to be one of the neo-Nazi marchers at Charlottesville, instigated a barrage of hate mail that included violent threats.  When someone publicly tweeted his home address, Quinn and his wife had to go into hiding until the crusade against them subsided.
In Nov. 2016, the presidential election went to then-Republican nominee Donald Trump, though suspicions of Russian hacking mired the results.  Since the election, news sources have reported the possibility that the Russian government activated several thousand fake social media profiles (like it was accused of doing in France) in order to influence the election through propaganda.
Commentators have yet to aggregate these and other incidents in a way that suggests a pattern. Although criticism of social media has waxed in recent years—as society has entered a stage of advanced interconnectivity—most of it has stayed the neoliberal course. The result has been a body of essays calling on individuals to police their own indulgent behaviors and framing overuse in pathological terms (so-called “Facebook Addiction Disorder,” for example). When confronted with quagmires like Pinker’s, the usual critics ignore the manifest disjunction between individual attitudes (which are often polite) and collective behaviors (which can contradict individuals’ behavioral tendencies). They also forfeit the possibility that social technologies stand to profit from our collective degeneracy. By locating the problem in our own weakness of will, these critics offer very little in the way of actual critical analysis.
Recently, some high-ranking members of the social media apparat have broken with the party line to express concern. Last winter, former Facebook vice president for user growth Chamath Palihapitiya announced that Facebook was providing the “tools that are ripping apart the social fabric.” Since then, early Facebook investor Roger McNamee published three articles deriding the company for its intended addictive quality and hands-off approach to fake news. McNamee even called on Facebook’s CEO, Mark E. Zuckerberg, to report before Congress for his company’s negligence.
McNamee and Palihapitiya are welcome to wage their crusades, but their calls for reform are ultimately toothless. Palihapitiya told listeners that when he left Facebook, he forbade his own children from creating accounts. That was all he could do. McNamee proposed a government investigation into Facebook’s reckless attitude toward misinformation, but he himself has since acknowledged the insufficiency of federal oversight.
This author offers an alternative to the usual incrementalism. Zuckerberg and his cohort should surrender their platforms.
In the present age of advanced technology, our laissez-faire attitude toward the digital lifeworld has left us with competing assessments of our technological circumstances. One view asserts that technology—like Kant’s “wit, judgment, and… talents”—is good or bad depending on its use. So it goes that if television broadcasts propaganda it is bad, and if it broadcasts Sesame Street, it is good. The second view, which differs only slightly, holds that technology can be neither good nor bad, as it is merely a medium. The episodes in Cambridge, Arkansas, and America at-large suggest that both of these views are lacking.
Marshall McLuhan, the Canadian media theorist, famously resolved this question with the formulation that “the medium is the message.” McLuhan meant that the vehicles through which content is transmitted have their own social effects, independent of what exactly they carry.
Television, according to this view, didn’t affect American households just by its sitcoms and dramas. The television itself inaugurated an era in which people read less because they could watch. It destroyed the sanctity of the dinner table by drawing the family to its evening programming. Thus, whether the monitor picked up the Muppets or Les Crane, social life was changed irrevocably.
Television has benefits, of course. A “bad” medium can still transmit “good” content or demonstrate “good” use. This has been a common talking point among social justice activists, who acknowledge that social media has made educating and mobilizing easier than ever. Yet a bad medium still corrupts. The rise of “slacktivism” has only become possible with platforms like Facebook and Twitter, which function entirely through optics, making it easy to look the part of an activist. We can’t take this to mean progress.
Until now, the extent of our criticism of social media has been to rearticulate the “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” philosophy: cut down on Facebook time, monitor children’s Twitter and Instagram access, only follow reputable pages. But the time for these individualistic efforts is long past when professors must flee their homes to avoid a mob.
The medium itself is rotten, facilitating a style of insurgent politics that exacerbates disagreement, scales misinformation, and robs users of focus. If Zuckerberg still reads The Crimson, he should take this as a friendly call to action: for the good of the culture, shut your platform down.

Salma: In a conversation with a co-worker this summer, we discussed the ways in which anger manifests itself in our own lives. The conversation veered towards discussions of fights with family, shortened tempers, rage, and how these emotions can be crippling and debilitating in times where cool-headedness is more productive. In the middle of the conversation, I reflected out-loud: “I don’t really think I experience anger that often…”
At this point in the summer, this answer was not far from the truth. I did not experience crippling and debilitating rage often. If cool-headedness was the best way to approach rationality and productivity, then cool-headed is what I would strive to be.Nicholas: I remember having similar conversations, especially in the context of productivity. We live in a world where anger is devalued, because it isn’t productive—or at least that’s what we’re told. This is particularly true for black rage. In the face of Ku Klux Klan, Donald Trump, and that one low-key white nationalist in your section (we all know they exist), we’re expected to not be angry, and we convince ourselves that we are, in fact, not angry. We’re particularly discouraged from introducing anger into our emancipatory work, public service, and attempts to dismantle structures of white supremacy. S: When I came back to campus sophomore year, I was able to examine my environment in the absence of those rose-tinted glasses that are handed to you at the beginning of your first year. I looked around and saw all of the ways that students of color are expected to break their backs and take time out of their day for the benefit of their white peers. And I felt enraged. I felt like throwing those rose-tinted glasses onto the ground, putting on hefty combat boots, and stomping until the glasses were nothing but an indiscernible pile of glass and metal on my dorm room floor.
But the glasses were metaphorical and I didn’t own any combat boots, so instead I emailed a few administrators asking to talk about my experience as a student of color on campus. When I expressed to them my concerns, I was met with several “I’m sorry that you feel that way”s and suggestions to seek out mental health support. While mental health support has been central to my survival, by offering this solution alone—without taking steps to dismantle the structures of oppression that lie at the heart of these struggles—administrators were asking me to cope with and accept injustice.
They were more concerned with my anger than what was causing it. They were more concerned with the perceived dangers of my emotions than the structures that caused my constant rage.N: Like, y’all. We are so angry! Every day, we are forced to witness and participate in a world that has always and continues to dehumanize and degrade us. How can we not be mad in a world filled with thousands of Marsha P. Johnsons and Tamir Rices and Erica Garners, and thousands of David Dukes and Donald Trumps? The grinning, shuffling Uncle Tom who welcomes their oppression with open arms? That doesn’t exist.
We don’t enjoy living in a white supremacist state. It makes us furious. And our anger is a fundamental form of self-expression. It is powerful, humanizing, to stand up and shout in that section kid’s face, “You make me furious! Your attempts to dismantle my humanity enrages me!” To be angry is to be human. And the first tool of that white supremacist state and society has been to make that anger the problem, has been to focus its attention on eradicating and suppressing our rage rather than dealing with white supremacy. At Harvard, in my student organizations, in my lectures and class discussions, in my conversations with friends, my anger has been neutered and disregarded. It has been made the problem. In so demonizing my rage, this world seeks to reduce me to that grinning Uncle Tom, to that inhuman caricature. But I am a human being, and human beings get mad. To disregard that is to dehumanize me.S: And when I’ve expressed my anger, I’ve received paragraphs from people I work with, lecturing me on the dangers of anger. They ask, “Don’t you think that anger fuels hatred?” No! It is hatred—interpersonal and systemic—that fuels anger. It is the expectation that I am here to teach rather than to learn that causes my displeasure. It is having central tenets of my identity come under constant scrutiny that fuels this rage. And if hatred fuels anger, then our anger is a signal that something is fundamentally unjust about the systems we’re interacting with. Our anger tells us something has to change. Our anger leads us to meet with administrators, draft legislation, and push for solutions. Our anger is productive.N: Our anger has the power to change the world. Stop telling us not to get angry. We’re going to be angry until our black skins can live in this world without being torn apart.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last fall, the Undergraduate Council’s old voting system had difficulties handling election traffic. Last spring, literally no one—not even the sole candidate running—voted in the Quincy midterm elections. With this backdrop, one would hope the Council took some serious proactive steps in preparation for last week’s midterms.
After many students were left waiting for the voting portal to accept their submissions in the fall, with many unable to cast a vote at all, the UC deserves credit for getting a new platform up and running for last week’s midterm election. However, a new voting system is not enough.
The midterms see around a fifth of seats on the Council on the ballot, yet the election has been relegated to insignificance at best and a subversion of democracy at worst by the UC’s poor publicity efforts and short voting period.
Last year, 27 students declared candidacy for 12 open seats—nothing to write home about. This time around, the ratio was even worse. Only seventeen students vied for 10 open seats, with four Houses holding uncontested elections, twice as many as last year.
This should come as no surprise given several missteps in preparing the election. In their welcome back email at the beginning of the semester, UC president Catherine L. Zhang ’19 and vice president Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 advertised Houses with open UC seats, yet forgot to mention both Adams House and Leverett House. This year, neither House had a contested election.
More troublingly, both Houses had returning UC members up for re-election. In both these cases, according to Leverett House representative Salma Abdelrahman ‘20, other UC officials have privately defended the failure to solicit candidates by citing the fact that seat openings came suddenly. But that is not an excuse.
In spring 2017, after an Elm Yard representative left the Council on short notice, the deadline to declare candidacy for the position was extended. In Leverett House, the seat opening was known well in advance, coming as the result of a representative’s term ending on the Executive Board, yet not a single email went out about the opening. Only on Jan. 31, about halfway through the voting period, did a UC representative send an email acknowledging the shortcoming. Instead of a real fix, the Council suggested that interested students pursue a write-in campaign. This is disappointing. It delegitimized the official process by encouraging students to participate without a proper understanding of election rules, as candidates officially on the ballot must attend an information session with the Election Commission.
Less than 10% of students voted in the midterm elections last year, and this year’s turnout of 371 cast ballots was even worse and unsurprising, given the Council’s apparent lack of any strategy to increase turnout. The new voting system alone is not enough. Zhang and Boucher’s automated email went out after 1 p.m. on Jan. 30, leaving less than 48 hours until the voting window closed at noon on Feb. 1. In Quincy, for example—apart from Zhang and Boucher’s Harvard-wide email—not a single email reminding students to vote was sent. The UC already saw a less-than-desirable election turnout in the fall. Comparatively, these midterms had a shorter voting window and received less publicity from the Council. This is disappointing.
With a fifth of seats on the Council up for election this midterm election cycle, it was disheartening to see the UC undermine its elections by failing to give them the attention they deserve and give the candidates running their fair opportunity. During a time in the College’s history in which the UC is growing in power and influence, maintaining a democratic process and equal playing field, even in less significant elections, is critical in maintaining trust between the Council and those it serves and represents. Around the country, voter suppression is a serious problem. The events of the last week run dangerously close to being just that. Harvard should at least stand to be one place that values elections and turnout.
I know firsthand the impact of these failures. When I sought to run for a position this election season, I was forced to pursue a write-in campaign after being unable to formally declare my candidacy due to the Council’s communication oversight. This ultimately led to a re-election of the incumbent UC representative against whom I was running. Though my bid was unsuccessful, I am hopeful that it will lead to positive change in future elections.
The UC serves as the voice of the student body, and on many counts it does a strong job representing the concerns and opinions of undergraduates. To ensure student trust and confidence in the Council, however, it is critical the UC emphasize its elections. With greater effort and focus devoted to midterm elections, the Council will continue to be an effective and democratic outlet for pursuing change on this campus.

UPDATED: February 8, 2018 at 3:52 a.m.
Botanists at Harvard’s Arnold Arboretum discovered a new species of Eastern Asian hemlock tree with a natural resistance to a notorious invasive insect, according to a study published in Dec. 2017.
The Ulleungdo hemlock is only native to an island off the coast of South Korea and is so rare that it may likely be listed as an endangered species in the near future. Senior Research Scientist Emeritus Peter Del Tredici, a member of the team that discovered the tree, said the process leading up to the discovery actually began at the Arnold Arboretum—a botanical garden and research center funded by Harvard—several years before.
The first temperate conifer species to be discovered in over 10 years, the Ulleungdo hemlock is valuable to scientific study because of its observed resistance to the hemlock woolly adelgid—an invasive insect that kills trees by sucking out their sap—which has devastated native hemlock populations in the eastern United States.
“You could take this species and hybridize it with another species—say the Chinese hemlock, which is also resistant to the hemlock adelgid—and you could begin the process of breeding a new species of hemlock or a new variety of hemlock that’s resistant to the adelgid,” Del Tredici said.
Del Tredici credits the initial observation of the tree to Nathan P. Havill, a former graduate student at Yale, who studied the hemlock woolly adelgid at the Arboretum in the early 2000s.
“There was one of these hemlock trees that when [Havill] looked at the DNA analysis on it, he said, ‘You know, I’ve looked at a lot of hemlock trees, and this one says it’s this Japanese species, Tsuga sieboldii, but the genetics don’t line up with the other Tsuga sieboldiis. There’s something a little bit different from it,’” Del Tredici said.
About three years later, Del Tredici and a colleague traveled to the Korean island from which they had received the tree’s seeds in 1980 and collected samplings from 30 trees for analysis.
Garth Holman, then a Ph.D. student at the University of Maine, analyzed the DNA from these specimens, compared them to their Japanese and Chinese counterparts, and confirmed that the Ulleungdo hemlock was indeed a unique species. The research team published a paper on their findings in December.
“Finally, we came to the conclusion that this species that grew on this one island off the coast of Korea—that’s the only place it grows—was probably a remnant of a much bigger hemlock population that used to be on the Korean peninsula,” Del Tredici said. “Because it was warmer, this one species managed to survive out on the island when it was completely wiped out from the mainland.”
Del Tredici said the Ulleungdo hemlock could have far-reaching implications for other rare and endangered species.
“What’s really important here is that this island off the coast of Korea is not just a refuge for hemlocks, but there are about 20 or 30 other species that are only found on this one island,” Del Tredici said. “It’s a little bit like a Galapagos-type situation, where evolution has sort of proceeded on its own because it’s isolated from the mainland.”
“It’s really important from a conservation point of view that this island be rigorously protected,” he added.

Government professors Stephen R. Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt will discuss their bestselling book, “How Democracies Die," Wednesday, kicking off the second semester of the department's new "Gov Books" program.
Gov Books, which launched in the fall, seeks to connect students to faculty and raise awareness about ongoing faculty research, according to Government Chair Jennifer L. Hochschild.
The program was the “brainchild” of George Soroka, the assistant director of undergraduate studies and a lecturer for the Government Department, according to Professor Cheryl B. Welch, who implemented the program.
“We’re hoping that this breaks down some of the barriers between faculty and students,” Welch said.
At Wednesday’s event, Government concentrators will have the opportunity to discuss the book with the professors and take home a signed copy.
Levitsky said the book is ideal for the program because it’s written for a wide audience.
“We draw on political science research, but we wrote the book in a way that is hopefully accessible to a broader public. It is a book that we hope many Harvard students will read.”
Levitsky and Ziblatt both study democratic breakdowns in world history, and their New York Times bestselling book lays out trends in modern American politics which, they argue, indicate American democracy may be in danger.
“Nobody ever thinks about a serious democratic crisis, a constitutional crisis in the United States,” Levitsky said. “Because we take our democracy and our democratic stability for granted.”
Levitsky pointed to the 2016 election as the impetus of the decision to co-write the book with Ziblatt.
“The [Trump] campaign is what pushed us over the edge. This is the first time in more than a century that either party had nominated a candidate with such demonstrably weak commitment to democratic and constitutional norms,” Levitsky said. “But when we started doing the research, we realized that the problem runs quite a bit deeper than Trump.”
The book compares a weakening of “key democratic norms” in the United States over the last 25 years to historical democratic crises in Latin America and Europe, according to Levitsky, and warns that the combination of President Trump’s “demagogic” rhetoric and hyperpartisanship in Congress could weaken democratic institutions.
Levitsky cited recent events like Republicans’ blocking of President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nomination and the recent government shutdown in January as emblematic of this hyperpartisanship.
“Polarization is really dangerous. And all of us have to take steps to facilitate dialogue across the two poles," he said.
The book also offers action items for concerned citizens, including undergraduates.
“Democrats should fight, they should protest, they should resist Trump in an energetic manner, but they should do so in a way that is norm-defending, not norm-violating,” Levitsky said.

Columbia University will not respond to a bargaining request from its graduate student union, University Provost John H. Coatsworth wrote in a letter to Columbia students on Tuesday. Experts say the developments at Columbia could have significant ramifications for Harvard's upcoming second unionization election.
As a result of the university’s decision, organizers with the Graduate Workers of Columbia-United Auto Workers say they plan to file an unfair labor practice claim with the National Labor Relations Board.
In his email, Coatsworth wrote that recognizing a graduate students union would compromise the university’s educational mission, and that the university seeks to pursue “the legal process” before collectively bargaining with students.
“We remain convinced that the relationship of graduate students to the faculty that instruct them must not be reduced to ordinary terms of employment,” Coatsworth wrote.
Labor experts said Columbia’s refusal to bargain and the resulting NLRB proceedings could impact Harvard's upcoming unionization election.
A 2016 National Labor Relations Board decision at Columbia set the precedent for graduate student unionization at private universities, but will likely be reversed by a Republican-led board, according to former NLRB chairman William B. Gould IV and University of Oregon Professor of Labor Education Gordon Lafer.
“Most NLRBs and most courts would say, well, we’re not going to decide the question of whether or not Columbia University was correctly decided until we’ve decided whether the union’s complaints have merit,” said Gould, who is currently a law professor at Stanford. “But this board is very anxious to reverse as much Obama-era precedent as it can.”
Any decision by the NLRB stating that graduate students may not unionize would imperil the unionization effort at Harvard. Eligible graduate and undergraduate teaching assistants are set to vote in April on whether or not to collectively bargain with the University through Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers.
Gould said, however, that the NLRB is unlikely to stop graduate unionization by directly ruling in the Columbia case. He added that NLRB Chairman Marvin E. Kaplan, who was appointed by President Donald Trump last year, will likely recuse himself from the ongoing case due to family ties with the university, leaving the board with two Democrats and one Republican. Trump has also yet to formally nominate a fifth member, who is expected to vote against continuing to recognize graduate students as workers.
“There are only three people who can vote on this refusal to bargain, and I would imagine that they would handle this in the normal way. Trump has expressed an intent to nominate someone else, a fifth person, to be on the board,” Gould said. “But even if that happens, and I don’t think they’re going to delay handling the case, and the vote would still be 2-2, which would uphold the regional director’s decision.”
Gould said it is more likely that a Republican-led NLRB would seek to reverse the 2016 Columbia precedent by ruling in a different graduate unionization dispute where Kaplan would not have a conflict of interest.
Yale, Boston College, and several other universities currently have pending appeals of the 2016 Columbia decision before the NLRB.  The full NLRB may hear these cases in the coming months, possibly resulting in a decision to reverse the graduate unionization precedent.
Union organizers at both Columbia and Harvard were critical of Columbia’s decision to decline GWC-UAW’s bargaining request.
Olga Brudastova, a Columbia graduate student and union organizer, called the University’s decision “outrageous” in an email.
“It is nothing else but another disingenuous attempt to stall in the hopes that the movement will go away.  But the majority support at Columbia and the graduate worker movement nationally just keep growing,” Brudastova wrote.
“We will continue the fight with any means necessary until Columbia and all other universities agree to respect the democratic choice of graduate workers to unionize.”
Andrew B. Donnelly, an HGSU-UAW organizer, echoed Brudastova’s remarks and criticized Columbia’s decision not to recognize its graduate student union.
“I think it’s clear that these universities are siding with, they’re using, the Trump board. They’re using his right-wing nationalist government in order to undermine the labor rights of their employees,” Donnelly said.
“They’re perfectly willing to go along with the Trump administration when it affects their bottom line.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran sent an email to University affiliates Monday discussing the University’s preparations for the April student unionization election.
Curran’s email follows an NLRB announcement Friday that a second election to determine whether eligible graduate and undergraduate teaching assistants may collectively bargain will be held on April 18 and 19.
In his email, Curran outlined which students would be eligible to vote in the upcoming election.  The basis for inclusion on the voter list remain the same as the original criteria which the University, the Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers, and the National Labor Relations Board negotiated in 2015, when the unionization process began.
The interpretation of these criteria, as well as the accuracy of the voter list, was a point of contention in the 2016 unionization election. HGSU-UAW successfully argued that the 2016 voter list was inadequate to the NLRB, which mandated the second election in January.
After negotiations over when the new list should be generated, the NLRB determined that the final voter list will be based on the March 12 payroll.  Harvard will begin to contact eligible voters in mid-February.
Curran said that the University plans to send email updates to students on the voter list along with information about the voting process and polling locations. These reminders will continue until the dates of the election.
Curran also encouraged eligible students to vote, echoing previous statements by the University. Harvard has not taken an official position on whether graduate students should form a union, but has encouraged voters to read both pro- and anti-unionization material in its communications.
“Everyone who is eligible to vote should vote, because the election will be decided only by those who cast ballots, just like any political election. This means that if you are in the bargaining unit that the HGSU-UAW proposes to represent, the outcome of this election will affect you whether or not you vote,” Curran wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The federal government launched an investigation into Harvard in 2016 for allegedly failing to respond “promptly and equitably” to a complaint of sexual assault at the College, according to documents obtained by The Crimson.
The case is one of three ongoing federal inquiries into Harvard for alleged violations of anti-sex discrimination law Title IX. The Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights enforces the law, which applies to all educational institutions that receive federal funding.
The complaint that prompted the 2016 investigation into the College was originally filed with OCR in May 2015. In the complaint, the petitioning individual claims the College discriminated against him on the basis of sex due to the amount of time that had elapsed since Harvard had received the initial sexual assault complaint.
The specific date of the sexual assault claim was redacted from the documents provided by the Department of Education, along with many identifying details.
“While OCR does not require that an investigation be completed in 60 days, it is required that the resolution of sexual violence complaints be prompt and equitable,” the complainant wrote.“There have been very few attempts to make the process more swift and many instances in which the process was extended unnecessarily.”
It is not clear from the documents whether the petitioner was the alleged victim or alleged perpetrator in the incident in question.
OCR opened an investigation into his complaint in March 2016, and the office sent a letter to University President Drew G. Faust announcing the inquiry. 
“The complainant alleged that the College discriminated against students on the basis of sex by failing to promptly and equitably respond to reports and/or incidents of sexual assault and harassment and, as a result, students were subjected to a sexually hostile environment,” the letter reads. “The OCR has determined that this allegation is appropriate for investigation.”
The Crimson reported the existence of this investigation in November, and later acquired documents specifying the allegations made in 2016 via a Freedom of Information Act request. The College also faces an open investigation into a widely-publicized 2014 complaint and another that OCR launched against the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 2017.
Harvard has overhauled its Title IX administration and adopted a new University-wide sexual assault policy since the first investigation began in 2014. The University restructured its Title IX office last year, splitting its educational and support resources from its investigative arm, now called the Office for Dispute Resolution. The school has also implemented new sexual harassment training programs both online and in person for students and employees across the University.
The 2016 and 2017 OCR documents show that the federal office initially joined the 2017 complaint against FAS and GSAS with the earlier College cases, later splitting that complaint to consider it separately.
OCR contacted the complainant and Victoria L. Steinberg ’01, a lawyer connected to the 2017 case, to inform them that OCR was revising its scope of investigation and considering the claims independently. The documents did not make clear whom Steinberg represented in the case.
Colby Bruno, a lawyer with the Victim Rights Law Center, said it is common for complaints against a school to be combined initially with other pending investigations.
“If you have multiple complaints against one school, they will often join them to ensure that the same investigator has access to all of the information,” she said.
But, she said, if one case alleges additional types of violations, the complainant or OCR may seek to remove that case and consider it separately.
Like the 2016 complaint, the 2017 case raises concerns about promptness and equity in an investigation into a sexual assault allegation, though it also includes separate accusations against GSAS. That case also asks OCR to examine whether the school inadequately published grievance procedures, failed to appoint a Title IX coordinator to oversee University-wide efforts to comply with Title IX, and failed to publish notices of non-discrimination.
University spokesperson Tania DeLuzuriaga defended the University’s approach to handling complaints of sexual assault in a statement Monday.
“Harvard responds fairly and purposefully to allegations of sexual assault among its students, faculty, and staff. The University has, in recent years, invested a great deal in ensuring the community has resources to prevent and respond to instances of sexual assault,” she wrote.
She added, “These efforts include the adoption of a new Title IX Policy and Procedures in 2014, the creation of the Office for Dispute Resolution where trained professionals neutrally investigate allegations of policy violations, and increased training and resources to both prevent and respond to incidents.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 11, 2018 at 12:47 a.m.
The Undergraduate Council will conduct a survey to gather student input on current mental health resources and inclusion on campus in order to help the UC better allocate its resources.
The survey, which passed the Council on a 29-3-1 vote on Monday, asks students about their mental health experiences on campus and whether they feel informed of the resources available to them.
Student Life Committee Chair Arnav Agrawal ’20, who co-sponsored the resolution to conduct the survey, said the survey will serve as a “temperature check” of the student body on issues of mental health.
“We would like to use this as a metaphorical tape measure to calculate our distance from that ever-elusive destination of perfect inclusion at Harvard,” Agrawal said.
In addition, Agrawal said he hopes the survey will help destigmatize mental health and promote dialogue between students and their UC representatives.
“I think that this will help foster communication and conversation between the UC and the general student body, foster conversations in dining halls, and start normalizing mental health,” Agrawal said.
Multiple representatives were reluctant to vote to approve the survey without additional questions focusing on sexual violence.
“I view [sexual violence] and mental health as inseparable,” Lowell House Representative Michael Scherr ’20 said.  “I haven’t heard enough in terms of how this was geared towards gender inclusivity and to represent all Harvard students.”
In response to the concerns, Lowell House Representative Julia Huesa ’20 proposed an amendment adding two questions to the survey. Huesa had earlier brought up the issue and said she was troubled the survey left out questions surrounding sexual violence, which she said she viewed as a fundamental component of the questionnaire.
The first question will ask respondents whether they have “experienced sexual violence” during their time at Harvard. The second asks about respondents’ experiences with institutional bodies on campus relating to sexual assault and harassment.
Agrawal agreed to accept the amendment, but said the mental health advisors that he and other survey leaders consulted with expressed their desire to save questions about sexual assault for a separate survey.
Quincy House Representative Sarah Fellman ’18 said that she also worried that the response rate would not be high enough to accurately represent the student body’s opinions.
“I think it’s something we have to work really hard on to try to figure out what we’re going to do to actually get people to take this survey,” Fellman said.
Fellman pointed to the 53 percent response rate on the 2015 Sexual Assault Climate Survey despite numerous entreaties to complete the survey by influential figures including Conan O’Brien and University President Drew G. Faust.
UC President Catherine L. Zhang ’19 announced at the meeting that over 50 professors, including former University President Lawrence H. Summers, have agreed to host a dinner as part of Harvard Conversations, a new Council initiative modeled off the popular Classroom to Table program.  The UC agreed to partly fund the program at last week’s general meeting.
Student Relations Committee Chair Nicholas Whittaker ‘19 also said at the meeting that the committee will co-host town halls once each semester in conjunction with the newly-established UC caucuses. The town halls will focus on addressing the concerns of the communities each caucus represents, Whittaker said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Any matchup of Ancient Eight teams is full of anticipation and excitement. Any matchup between Harvard, Yale, and Princeton garners even more thrill. Such was the case over the weekend, as the Crimson, Bulldogs, and Tigers met at Blodgett Pool for an intense contest before Ivy League Championships, looming over the horizon on February 14.
“Harvard, Yale, Princeton has higher energy than other dual meets that we have, and also way more exciting because the competition is much more fierce,” senior captain Kristina Li said. “Racing at this dual meet was incredibly exciting. We had a lot of our alum come back to support us, and we had a lot of our parents come and men’s team members be in the stand, so we had a huge Harvard crowd cheering us on … and [this meet] got people really fired up to race at Ivies.”
Although Harvard (4-2, 4-2 Ivy) ultimately fell in dual contests to Yale (11-0, 7-0) and Princeton (9-3, 6-1), 162-138 and 177-123, respectively, the Crimson had many strong swimming and diving performances that highlighted the team’s potential to have a strong presence in the league meet in a couple of weeks.
In the very first race of the meet, the 200-yard medley relay, the Harvard’s A unit shattered the pool record set three years ago by Yale. The cohort of sophomore Mei Lynn Colby, freshman Ingrid Wall, junior Brittany Usinger, and sophomore Jerrica Li touched the wall in 1:39.78.
Colby’s winning ways were not done, as the Dallas, Texas, native emerged victorious in the 100-yard backstroke, out touching Tigers freshman Stephanie Nelson in 55.09. In the 50-yard freestyle, the sophomore finished third in a race in which Yale junior Bella Hindley broke a pool swam a record-breaking race in 22.43.
Another notable performance came at the hands of freshman Jaycee Yegher. The Crimson rookie broke a school record in the 200-yard breaststroke in 2:11.72. Yegher out-touched sophomore Cha O’Leary by eight-hundredths of a second, a photo finish that ignited the pool. Sophomore Miki Dahlke added strong performances throughout the two-day meet. She finished second in the 100-yard freestyle in 50.38, third in the 200-yard freestyle in 1:49.05, and fifth in the 100-yard butterfly in 54.75.
Diving, which has been a dependable facet of the team throughout the whole season, unsurprisingly posted more strong performances. In three meter diving, senior Hannah Allchurch finished 316.60 points, more than 10 points than the rest of the field. Junior Mikaela Thompson finished in third with 297.00 points.
“This being my last year, I’ve been doing the same dives for a long time, and so really honing down on consistency and trusting that I know how to do these dives, and just to keep a calm head, both in practice and going into the competition,” Allchurch said. “I honestly just went in with the mentality that I know what I’m doing. I just want to have fun with my teammates. I want to be there to support them and give it my best shot, and thankfully it worked out.”
In the one meter diving event, the trio of Thompson and seniors Jing Leung and Alisha Mah took second through fourth within a 10 point spread of one another.
In the final event of the meet, the 400-yard freestyle relay, the Crimson’s A relay of Colby, Wall, Li, and Dahlke finished in 3:18.78, more than a second ahead of Yale’s top unit. As Dahlke touched the wall, her teammates and the crowd erupted.
“Our coach Stephanie Morawski, she always talks to us in the beginning, and one thing that she says is that every single person has a role, especially in Ivies, when only a certain amount of us can actually compete, the whole team still has it’s part to play, and so if maybe at some meets you’re not competing as well as you’d like to, you can’t get caught up in yourself because there’s still your whole team there,” Allchurch said. “Your role might switch, and it might be that time you’re going to be super loud and you’re going to get behind your teammates and make sure they have everything they need.”
The team now shifts its focus on the Ivy League Championships, in which the Ancient Eight will reconvene and battle it out once more at Blodgett Pool. Dual meets aside, the championship will test each team’s depth and grit.
“We definitely have a strategy going into the meet,” Li said. “I’m really confident in our team going forward because we do have a lot of depth. Every single person in the Ivy League Championships can score points. I think one of our strengths lies in the depth of our team. Dual meets and the Ivy League Championships are a little different because I think Ivies relies more on depth, so I’m excited to see what our team can pull out.”

BOSTON — A big stage. Two big teams. A big finish.
None of these circumstances were the least bit surprising in Monday night’s Beanpot semifinal game between the Harvard men’s hockey team and Boston University.
The bout required extra time to declare a winner, but after 23 minutes of overtime hockey, that winner was BU, courtesy of freshman forward Ty Amonte. The Terriers edged the Crimson, 3-2, and will advance to play Northeastern in next Monday's tournament finale.
With tired legs on both sides of the ice, the rookie strode into the offensive zone with the puck and fired a wrist shot short-side on tri-captain goaltender Merrick Madsen. The seemingly routine save snuck by Madsen and cued the cheers from what remained of a BU fan section.
“The game was a series of momentum swings,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “I thought both teams battled, both goalies made some big saves, and as often happens in overtime, it’s not necessarily this great Picasso that ends up in the net.”
Despite the ending, Madsen’s overall performance (39 SV, 2.20 GAA, .929 SV%) was solid and included some game-changing saves. Staring down the ice at the Arizona Coyotes prospect, however, freshman net-minder Jake Oettinger put forth an even sturdier effort (47 SV, 1.46 GAA, .959 SV%) for BU (15-11-2, 10-7-2 Hockey East).
“Our goalie stood tall when he had to,” Terriers coach David Quinn said. “He was huge in the second period, made some big saves [on] the penalty kill and [in] the overtime.”
The Crimson (10-9-4, 9-5-3 ECAC) entered this year’s Beanpot looking to defend last year’s tournament crown. With the loss, though, the program’s pursuit of its first back-to-back Beanpot victories comes to an end. The prospect of the Beanpot’s first Harvard-Northeastern final—in 66 years of the tournament—also died with Amonte’s double-overtime game-winner.
“When you win, they’re a dream,” said coach Donato bluntly, when asked about intense overtime games. “We have a lot of smart kids in the [locker] room, so to come up with something after the game that isn’t shallow or made-up [is difficult]…. The stakes are huge, and the winner moves on and the loser is heartbroken.”
The puck dropped in the third period with the two teams even at one. Harvard was carrying play offensively, outshooting BU, 32-17, through 40 minutes. But the ice tilt didn’t stop the Terriers from seizing the lead.
Just 32 seconds into the final frame, BU captain Brandon Hickey fired a shot at the Crimson’s own letter-wearer, Madsen. The net-minder gave up a juicy rebound, and a charging Hickey regained the puck before backhanding one past the goal line.
Not deterred by the early tally, Harvard equalized a mere minute and a half later. Sophomore forward Nathan Krusko tapped a puck into the neutral zone and started a 3-on-2 headed toward Oettinger.
Krusko, last year’s Beanpot MVP (2–1—3 in 2017 final), got the puck back after crossing into the offensive zone. His slapshot bounced up high on Oettinger, and freshman forward Jack Badini, streaking into the goal area, hammered it home.
“Just having guys ready for every play after a goal they score [or] a goal we score is something we wanted to harp on at the beginning of the year,” junior forward Ryan Donato said. “Those are kind of the big shifts, right after a goal or right after a power play.”
Badini was one of three freshmen between both teams to score in the contest. So much for rookies shying away from big moments. The Anaheim Ducks prospect notched his first Beanpot goal in his first tournament game. Coach Donato, though, was among the least surprised regarding Badini’s precocious play.
“We’re just about at the time of year where there really aren’t any freshmen anymore,” said the bench boss last week. “At least the teams that are going to have success are not worried about whether the guy is a freshman or not.”
Play soon settled down, and despite solid chances both ways, the teams’ skated to a tie through regulation, setting the stage for Amonte’s eventual game-winner.
Coming into the overtime classic, the Terriers were enjoying their best hockey of the season. Winners of its last five and unbeaten in its last seven before the tilt, BU has resurrected its season after playing a portion of the campaign below .500.
Due to the recent favorable results, BU was knocking on the door of Monday morning’s USCHO top-20 rankings, receiving the most votes among teams not on the big board.
Between the Terriers’ recent hot stretch and their desire to avenge last year’s final defeat, the Crimson faced a plenty-motivated squad. Another important win in the Beanpot semifinal may vault the squad back into the poll.
Unlike in the teams’ 2017 Beanpot meeting, BU opened the scoring in Monday’s tilt. Harvard sophomore John Marino went to the box for crosschecking Terriers freshman Brady Tkachuk, and BU cashed in on the subsequent power play.
Eight minutes into the opening frame, rookie forward Logan Cockerill saw a puck bounce out to the left of Madsen and wasted no time putting his fourth of the season past the tri-captain.
The power play proved futile once again for Harvard, as coach Donato’s group went 0-for-3 with the man-advantage against the Terriers. The team is now scoreless on the power play over its past four games, posting a 0-for-14 mark during that time.
Even strength, the Crimson looked more dominant. Despite entering the middle frame trailing by a goal, Harvard continued to throw everything it had on Oettinger.
After an ambitious 28 shot attempts (12 SOG) in the first, the team continued more of the same in the second stanza, only this time getting more pucks through the defense and on cage. Of its 32 attempts that period, the Crimson hit the target 20 times.
“For us, it was a tale of two games,” said coach Quinn, lauding Harvard’s dominance in the middle portion of the bout. “Our first period was okay, the second period might have been as bad a period as we’ve played all year. We talked in between the second and third periods. We felt very fortunate that it was a 1-1 hockey game.”
Eventually, the surge of offense was too much for Oettinger and the Terriers blue line. 35 minutes into the game, Harvard’s Ty, he of the Pelton-Byce variety, evened the contest with a top-shelf wrister.
Donato emerged from a board-battle with puck at the right circle. The Scituate, Mass., native turned goalward, where Oettinger was waiting with squared shoulders. Despite his reputation as a sniper, Donato fed Pelton-Byce in the high slot, and a quick release from the sophomore found twine. The goal marked Pelton-Byce’s first career Beanpot point.
Donato now says goodbye to his team—albeit temporarily—and ships off to PyeongChang, South Korea, to represent team USA in the Winter Olympics. One of the Crimson’s main tasks moving forward will be maintaining offensive firepower without the team’s centerpiece.
Monday’s affair marks the second time in the last four Beanpots that Harvard has gone to double overtime with BU. In 2015, the Crimson fell, 4-3, to the Terriers in the second frame of extra time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nothing about the Harvard men’s hockey team’s 3-2 double-overtime loss to Boston University seemed surprising, at least not at first. Through the opening overtime period, momentum swung both ways as tired players on both sides were trapped in their respective ends.
The back-and-forth continued until one sneaky shot beat tri-captain netminder Merrick Madsen three minutes into the second overtime frame. Just like that, the Crimson’s hopes of defending 2017’s Beanpot title were shattered. The seemingly benign wrister came from the unlikely stick of third-line rookie forward Ty Amonte, who spotted twine through Madsen’s pads and decided to take his chance.
“It’s a little bitter,” junior forward Ryan Donato said. “You can’t say we didn’t put everything into that game…. [But] college hockey is a game of mistakes, and that’s how a goal is scored.”
For Harvard (10-9-4, 9-5-3 ECAC), the loss does not so much raise questions about Madsen’s performance in net, who stood tall (.928%) despite falling back to a .500 win percentage on the season. The team must instead confront a string of offensive issues that it began to fix over the weekend at Dartmouth.
WHO'S GOT THE POWER?
In Monday night’s Beanpot game against Terriers (15-11-2, 10-7-2 Hockey East), Harvard’s power play continued its recent struggles. Back in January, a weekend of shutouts at the hands of now-No. 3 Cornell and Colgate capped off the Crimson’s otherwise promising month. The pair of clean sheets gave rise to a growing problem on the ice: the squad’s power play (in)efficiency, just 9.4 percent that month.
While the team put forth a four-goal performance last Friday against the Big Green and appeared threatening on its 5-on-4 opportunities, the man-advantage failed to produce yet again.
In the Beanpot semifinal, Harvard failed to execute on any of its three power plays, lengthening its scoreless streak on man-up chances to 15 and placing its execution rate among the bottom-ten in the country (14.3%). This marks the program’s longest scoreless power play streak since the beginning of the 2013-2014 season, when the Crimson failed to convert on 17 straight chances over five games, going 2-2-1 in that time. During the current man-up slump, Harvard is 2-3-0.
“The first [power play] was not great,” said Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 bluntly. “But I thought the next two, we had some good looks…[and] in overtime, [we had] some guys walking in the slot.”
The team was granted a power play in the middle of the first overtime frame—arguably its best chance to seize the victory. The second unit did force BU sophomore goalie Jake Oettinger to make some big saves, but, as has been the theme for Harvard recently, the puck just seemed to stay out.
“When it’s all said and done, they scored a goal on the power play and we didn’t,” coach Donato summarized. “It does seem to come down, in these big games, to special teams.”
Ryan Donato’s Wednesday morning departure for the Olympics only ups the urgency of the Crimson’s power play problem. With medal games in PyeongChang extending until Feb. 25, the junior has likely played his last game of the regular season. Donato, who leads the country with 21 goals, has been the offensive focal point of his team throughout the season, having a hand in two-thirds of Harvard’s man-advantage conversions.
OPEN SEASON
Sheer shot volume broke the Terriers down in last year’s Beanpot final, as Harvard cruised to victory with a 40-17 shot margin. Though the contrast was not quite so dramatic this time around, the team had 49 shots to BU’s 42 and owned the second period with a 20-4 shot advantage.
Historically, the Crimson has excelled in shooting extravaganzas, posting a record of 8-5-4 when outshooting the opponent this season, coming into the game. The trends were on Harvard’s side two-fold, as the Terriers entered Monday’s win at 2-5 this season when outshot by an opponent and 0-1 when allowing 40-49 shots.
“I certainly didn’t feel good about our chances after the second period,” said BU coach David Quinn. “We looked tired and slow...because we were chasing the puck. ”
Nevertheless, as Harvard learned after a season-high 51 shots proved fruitless against Colgate, having chances is not the same as burying them. Though the team controlled the game’s middle frame, the Terriers held slim advantages in all four other periods and found net on the only shot—by either team—in the second overtime.
A major reason the 3-2 contest required lots of shots from both teams was the play of both goaltenders, who looked poised despite the onslaughts they faced. In the first overtime frame, Oettinger shut down the Crimson’s power play, including a Donato attempt from the side of the net and a left-circle shot from junior forward Lewis Zerter-Gossage. Not to be outdone, Madsen made a sprawling save on BU alternate captain and junior Jordan Greenway, snatching up a puck that bounced dangerously overhead.
“It doesn’t always look pretty,” said coach Donato of Madsen’s scrambling overtime saves. “But [the Terriers] have some pretty dangerous guys.... You got the sense that on either end it was going to be a little bit of a strange goal, because both goalies were really dialed in there.”
NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK
The Beanpot has a tendency to birth new stars, and despite the bright lights, rookies showed up big on Monday night. Three of the game’s five goals were potted by players suiting up for their first ever Beanpot game—the Crimson’s by freshman Jack Badini, and BU’s courtesy of rookies Logan Cockerill and Amonte.
While Donato (5 GP, 3–1—4) leads the Crimson’s active Beanpot scorers, rookies performing is no surprise for Harvard or the Terriers. Now-sophomore Nathan Krusko earned tournament MVP honors last season for coach Donato’s squad, while BU’s freshmen have contributed 36 percent of the team’s points, netting 33 of 89 goals, this season. Plus, when BU faced Harvard last year, all three Terrier tallies were scored by freshmen.
The scoreboard isn’t the only place that rookies made an impact. Returning from illness, Crimson forward Henry Bowlby made his first Beanpot start on Monday, playing on the wing alongside tri-captain Jake Horton instead of his usual centerman, Donato. While Bowlby did not find the net, he shot off to several breakaways during the game, and had four shots on goal.
CHASING LIGHTS
Though one-goal leads are far from insurmountable, the Crimson might have balked at BU’s early goal given its performance this season. Harvard is 1-6-3 when trailing after the first frame, as it did on Monday night, as opposed to 9-1-0 when leading. The team’s only comeback win this season came on Jan. 20 against St. Lawrence, who at the time had not won a single conference game.
The Terriers, meanwhile, are unbeaten all season (11-0) when they leave the ice ahead on the scoreboard after 20 minutes. Until a 3-2 loss against UMass Lowell on Dec. 8, the team was 29-0-3 in games when taking a lead into either intermission.
Firing early and often has been a theme of BU’s recent success. Cockerill’s first-period power play tally capped off the team’s streak of scoring at least one goal in 14 straight periods before the Crimson held the Terriers off the scoresheet in the second frame.
