After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a change in the official grade submission deadline this year, many students are anxiously awaiting their final marks as the grades for numerous fall courses have yet to appear on students’ online records.
More than a week after the end of exam period, dozens of classes, including some of the fall semester’s largest offerings—Life Sciences 1a, Mathematics 1b, Ethical Reasoning 21, and Social Studies 10a, among many others—have not yet made grades available through the registrar’s website, according to students contacted by The Crimson.
“I am so frustrated right now. I keep checking my grades,” said Alexis R. Karlin ’12, who has not received grades for any of the five classes she took this fall.
“I’ve been checking every day since finals ended,” said Min Yu ’13, noting that the one class for which she has yet to receive a grade, Government 1740, had a final paper due on Dec. 10 and no final exam.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris wrote in an e-mailed statement that the official deadline for reporting grades changed this year. Previously course-specific submission deadlines were assigned based on when classes completed their final exams. This year all courses are required to submit grades by Jan. 3.
Harris said that under the old calendar—before the finals were moved before winter break—professors were generally required to submit their grades four days after their classes’ exams took place.
Last year, the four-day rule was applied to the new December exam calendar, resulting in submission deadlines that fell near Christmas.
Since it was “impossible” for many instructors to report grades in the days before or after Christmas, according to Harris, last year the academic deans decided informally to not consider grades delinquent until the second business day following the winter holidays.
This year, instead of initially assigning deadlines based on the dates of courses’ finals, “We made last year’s de facto policy the de jure policy,” Harris wrote.
Though they were unaware of the change in policy, several students said that the waiting period seemed longer than usual to them this year.
“The past four semesters, I’ve never felt that it’s taken this long to get my grades back,” said Bryce J. Gilfillian ’12, who has not yet received grades for two of his four classes. “All my friends are wondering the same thing. It’s like, where are the grades?”
“I definitely think it’s slower this year,” Karlin said, echoing Gilfillian’s comments. “I definitely got them before New Year’s last year, and I think before Christmas.”
Harris said that the change in policy “probably has a very small effect on the timing of grade receipt,” noting that professors who were able to complete their grading before break likely did so despite the later deadline.
“Students, like all other human beings, tend to (improperly) generalize from their own experiences,” Harris wrote. “Those who had all their grades by this time last year...assume a global change when, in all likelihood nothing of the kind has happened.”
Some grades have been added to the registrar's website during the break. The grades for two high-enrollment classes—Computer Science 50 and Chemistry 17, which boast 494 and 278 students, respectively—became viewable on students’ records during the day on Wednesday.
The Office of the Registrar and the instructors from fourteen classes that have yet to make their grades available have not returned requests for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team did not extend a very warm greeting to its neighbors from MIT, welcoming the Engineers (9-2) to Lavietes Pavilion with a 26-point drubbing yesterday afternoon.
Using a balanced offensive attack and an active defense, the Crimson (9-3) jumped out to an 18-point lead at the half and cruised to an 84-58 victory in front of 1,153 fans.
“I was really impressed with our first half defensively and the energy that our players played with,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought we were active, and I think we had a great deal of intensity and energy about us.”
Freshman sharpshooter Laurent Rivard led Harvard in scoring for the second consecutive contest, finishing with 17 points on 5-of-10 shooting from the floor. Five Harvard players managed to reach double-figures in scoring, including junior co-captain Keith Wright, who recorded his fifth double-double of the season by the end of the first half.
Wright—who had 13 points and 11 rebounds at the break—finished with 15 points and 13 rebounds in 27 minutes of play.
“I thought Keith Wright in particular was outstanding,” Amaker said. “To have a double-double in the first half, but more important and even more impressive was his effort on defense. I thought he was very active, and I thought it became a little contagious for our team.”
After the Crimson fell behind by a point early in the first period, Wright played a critical role in helping Harvard regain and extend its lead. Thanks in large part to six points and four rebounds from Wright, the Crimson rattled off a 15-2 run midway through the first period to capture a commanding 12-point lead.
After MIT’s Will Tashman’s put-back layup with 13:35 left in the first half put the Engineers up 12-11, junior co-captain Oliver McNally ignited the Harvard run, cutting to the basket from the left wing and floating the ball off the backboard into the hoop to take back the lead.
The Crimson forced MIT’s Mitchell Kates into a tough shot on the Engineers’ next possession, and Harvard sophomore Christian Webster corralled the missed attempt. Rivard attacked the rim on the ensuing Crimson possession, getting to the line and sinking two shots to give Harvard a three-point lead.
Wright brought the crowd to its feet moments later, faking a handoff to McNally to shake his defender away, taking one dribble to the basket, and finishing a one-handed jam over the Engineers’ Tim Donegan.
With the Harvard lead at five, Tashman attacked the Crimson basket, but sophomore Kyle Casey stepped in to take the charge.
On the other end, Casey found Rivard under the basket for an and-one layup that put Harvard up by eight. Tashman answered with a jumper from the left elbow for two of his game-high 19 points, but the Crimson then extended its lead to 12 off four free throws and a layup from Wright.
Harvard’s advantage grew from there, reaching a high of 19 before the end of the first period.
“We played a number of players and we kept that energy up,” Amaker said. “I think we wore them down.”
Casey—making his second start of the season—had an explosive start to the second half, throwing down a pair of two-handed slams in the first six minutes of the second frame.
Casey’s first flush came after the MIT defense left the 6’9” forward wide open under the basket, but Casey displayed his athleticism on his second dunk, slicing through the defense and finishing the slam in traffic.
“It was good to see some bounce back in Kyle,” Amaker said. “You can see how bouncy and athletic he is. He gives us some of those spectacular plays that can be very uplifting for our ball club.”
Harvard’s lead continued to grow, as the Crimson started to get hot from deep, connecting on four threes in the second half. Rivard led the way, shooting two-of-three from beyond the arc in the second frame.
“[Rivard’s] the best shooter on our team,” Wright said. “If he’s open, we’re always looking for him.”
Rivard’s second trey, which came off a pass from sophomore point guard Brandyn Curry in transition, put the home team up by 28 with 10:37 to play. The Crimson’s lead never dipped below 24 for the remainder of the contest, holding the Engineers—who were playing without their leading scorer Noel Hollingsworth—to a season-low 58 points.
“I think it was necessary to come out here and definitely pick it up defensively—that was really the main focus,” Wright said. “When you play hard, things tend to go your way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coaches always preach that practice makes perfect.
Reconvening after a brief winter break, the Harvard women’s basketball team had just one day to prepare for its matchup last night against Dayton.
“We had one practice [Wednesday] night at nine o’clock,” said Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “We tried to squeeze our game plan all into one practice.”
Not surprisingly, the host Flyers (8-5), armed with their high-powered offense, cruised to a 100-81 victory over Harvard (5-5) last night in Dayton, Oh. The hot-shooting Dayton squad finished with a 52.1 field-goal percentage, topping 100 points for the third time this season. Meanwhile, the Crimson shot a respectable 44.3 percent from the field, with three players—senior forward Emma Markley, junior guard Brogan Berry, and sophomore forward Victoria Lippert—in double figures.
“I wasn’t displeased with our kids’ efforts,” Delaney-Smith said. “But bottom line, [Dayton] was a better team.”
For Berry, who played her high school ball at nearby Carroll High, the game was a homecoming of sorts.
“It was great to be home, to play in front of my family and all my high school friends,” Berry said. “It was exciting to play in front of them and make them proud.”
The Flyers’ offense found its rhythm right from the start as Dayton’s Kristin Daugherty scored seven of the first 12 points. Two quick Harvard turnovers and a 13-2 Dayton lead four minutes into the game forced Delaney-Smith to call a 30-second timeout.
“We were down 12 points immediately, and that hurt us,” Delaney-Smith said. “They’re a veteran team; what they do well offensively is read the defense. They run the floor very well. Their point guard [junior Patrice Lalor] is lightning quick and pushes the ball.”
Markley, who scored 19 points and grabbed four boards, converted on a three-point play with 15:30 left to close the lead to 15-7. Strong drives by Lippert and three consecutive post-ups by Markley put the Crimson to within nine points, trailing 39-30 with the first half of play winding down.
But every time Harvard appeared poised to make a comeback, Dayton found a way to extend its lead. The Flyers relied on a 13-6 run to go into the locker room with a comfortable 53-36 lead.
“We made some runs at them,” Delaney-Smith said. “There were times when we played some very tough defenses, yet they were still able to score.”
“They really pushed the ball well and got a lot of easy baskets and transition points,” Berry said. “That set us back at the beginning of the game.”
With a quick 8-2 Flyer run ignited by Daugherty’s back-to-back three pointers, the second half started just as the first began. Not surprisingly, the Crimson made another attempt at a comeback, employing different defensive schemes in the hopes of halting Dayton’s offensive attack.
“We used a lot of combination defenses and we’ll go four and five minutes where we’re doing a good job, and then they’ll just shove it down our throats and get an easy look,” Delaney-Smith said. “They’re a very well-coached and disciplined offensive team.”
With six minutes elapsed in the second half, Lippert and co-captain Christine Matera drilled three-pointers to cut the lead to 66-45.
Despite the sharpshooting, turnovers continued to plague Harvard the entire night, preventing the team from catching up with its opponent. The Crimson turned the ball over 23 times in total, giving Dayton 31 points off of its mistakes.
“We still were plagued by turnovers,” Delaney-Smith said. “In the games that we lost, that was always on the list of what went wrong. It’s not any one player, it’s each player has two or three and that’s too many. And it wasn’t their defense…there were shots that we were able to get. The turnovers were us beating ourselves.”
With the final game of the calendar year wrapped up, Delaney-Smith hopes the team will use the loss as a valuable learning opportunity to improve.
“We’re not where we expected to be, but we’re not in a bad place either,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think we can keep getting better; I saw a team that still believes that. We’ll put it behind us and move on. We have to go home and get ready for UMass.”
