After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though I am an unabashed Woody Allen fan, there is one movie of his that I cannot stand. In fact, “Vicky Christina Barcelona” takes the cake for one of Allen’s worst films in recent history. It traces the summer travels of two female best friends, Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson), as they vacation in Spain and  fall in love with a mysterious Spanish artist called Juan Antonio. Things are later complicated when Juan Antonio’s ex-wife María Elena enters the picture.
While all the actors in the film give splendid and convincing portrayals of their roles, it does not distract from some of the most ridiculous character development and dialogue in movie history.  Vicky and Cristina are girls who are initially foils for each other: Vicky represents tradition and monogamous love, while Cristina represents spontaneity and sexual freedom. At their core, both friends are lost, vulnerable, and struggling to figure out what they want out of life. While this juxtaposition is supposed to be funny, it falls flat because neither character is established as their given stereotype from the start. This is perhaps because we are told of their opposing personality dynamic by a narrator, rather than shown these differences in the film. Because of this early mistake, the rest of the movie struggles to develop  each of the characters—by the end they both are left in the same position that they started in.
Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) is the most undeveloped character of them all. He is supposed to be a sensual bon-vivant, but instead feels phony. Despite Bardem’s best attempts to make these qualities feel natural, his character is rather one dimensional. Allen tries to convince us that Juan Antonio’s bold advances and poetic language are a part of his character, but he feels more like a caricature speaking stilted and awkward dialogue. For example, shortly after happening upon Vicky and Cristina at a hotel, he invites them to spend the weekend with him in the following manner: “I’ll show you around the city, and we'll eat well. We'll drink good wine. We'll make love.” The line is not half as cringy on paper as it appears on camera. There is a self-awareness about the ridiculousness of the situation, but that is what makes it worse. The film knows that his character is a parody of male seducers, but continues to portray him in this way. His most redeeming moments are in the turbulent scenes he shares with María Elena, who Penélope Cruz plays marvelously. The two actors have great chemistry. However, this does not prevent Juan Antonio from feeling very forced and corny.
In all fairness, the film does have its funny moments, but they are not enough to surmount some of the flattest characters ever written for the big screen. Its lack of character development drags it down tremendously, which is rather disappointing because its whimsical plot has real potential for a truly entertaining movie.

As gaming systems become more technologically advanced, they can support higher-resolution, longer cutscenes, which means that some games seem more like movies, with tens of hours of scripted narrative content. This is a good thing.
But one trait video games seem to have inherited from the older industry is a fear of new ideas—or rather, a fear of doing something that hasn’t already performed well. Looking at the numbers, it can be difficult to understand why. Independent, or “indie,” game production is at an all time high, as game-making] tools become cheaper and more accessible. But the largest companies, like the AAA, or household-name studios like Ubisoft (of “Assassin’s Creed” fame—look for our review of their latest iteration in the coming weeks) and publishers like Activision-Blizzard (who just released the fourteenth game in the “Call of Duty” franchise) display a real reticence to create games that might flop.
So it is with “Shadow of War,” Monolith Games’ follow-up to their hit action-RPG “Shadow of Mordor.” This game continues the one-dimensional main character Talion’s quest to defeat Sauron and protect Gondor by utilizing the mystical abilities of the elven wraith Celebrimbor, the smith who forged the One Ring in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Talion is bound to Celebrimbor in a symbiotic relationship: Talion cannot be permanently killed, and Celebrimbor is free to enact his revenge and power-grabbing schemes from beyond the grave. Nothing in that respect has changed in “War” since the last title.
The main selling point of “War” is not its narrative. Similarly to the “Batman” series, its main draw is a slick combat engine employed to great effect alongside the Nemesis system, a truly impressive feat of engineering which randomly generates orc enemies for you to combat. The system, as suggested by its title, works to develop a bond between the player and the orcs they fight against. If you are killed by an orc, they’ll taunt you about it next time you see them. This is the most impressive part of the game, and it’s even more memorable and intricate in “War” than it was in “Mordor.”
But other than the addition of regions (which, though they do much to broaden the game’s scope, doesn’t actually change the core gameplay experience very much) and refinements to existing systems, “War” is mostly the same game as “Shadow.” You are the same parkouring, orc-murdering, magic-wielding, boring protagonist from the first game. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. “Shadow” is one of the best games of its kind in terms of systems. If you’re the kind of person who skips cutscenes and doesn’t really need an explanation for why you’re systematically mowing down hordes of different-yet-the-same enemies, you will enjoy this game. The combat is crisp, stealth is satisfying, and the mechanics are almost beyond reproach.
But if you’re looking for a Lord of the Rings game that you want to play for more than just the gameplay, with intriguing plotlines and mechanics that make it worth your while to play for more than a few hours, I’m afraid you might want to look elsewhere. Monolith has done a truly fantastic job setting up their game system, but it suffers from a boring main storyline, a lack of guidance for the player across its multiple questlines, and systems which become less compelling the longer you play.
Let’s talk about Talion. He ostensibly has thoughts, of which we hear very few, and all along the same line: “I hate Sauron because he killed my wife and son, vengeance will be mine.” He gets a few good lines in the game, mostly thanks to his interactions with other characters—Bruz, an orc who helps the player learn the mechanics behind Fortresses, the region-wide extension of the Nemesis system, and Ratbag, a zany orc whose ambition and cowardice combine to make him an unlikely ally. The combination of heard-it-before character motivation and unimaginative narrative scenarios combine throughout the game to form a profound feeling of “meh.” That sensation is only underscored by the brief moments of interest which occasionally shine through the muck of mediocrity to remind you that the game could have been great in this respect as well.
There aren’t any characters written strongly enough to carry the game on their own merit, but the game introduces a few who certainly would have been more interesting as main characters than Talion. There’s Eltariel, Galadriel’s assassin, who wields her power against the Witch King and his Nazgul followers. She would have been at least marginally more interesting as a character while also allowing the developers to create distinct abilities for her (much the way Bethesda Softworks’ “Dishonored 2” gave the main character’s daughter from the first game distinct abilities from her father, allowing for new gameplay scenarios). Baranor, a Gondorian captain serving under a corrupt general and the first black character in the franchise, would have provided similar opportunities for the narrative to develop and for this game to feel less like an extension of its predecessor.
“War” is fundamentally the same game as “Shadow”: a bit more polished and on a much larger map, but still the same core gameplay loop. When I started the game, it didn’t feel like a new experience. It felt like more of the same. Is more of the same, when the same is really good, worth sixty dollars? For some, it would be. “War” is a great game, really, but it lacks a spark, something to help it rise above the other content released this season. Until Monolith finds that spark, the “Shadow” franchise will only be a good series, not a great one. In many ways, “War” is a story of missed opportunities. Monolith has created a good game, but it serves mostly to remind players that it could have been a great game had the studio been slightly less risk-averse and slightly more adventurous.

Tyler E. Spindel ’07 is a Hollywood film director currently working on two comedy movies. He was a stand-up comedian in New York, a producer for “Chelsea Lately,” and worked on various shows on Comedy Central. The Harvard Crimson sat down with Spindel to chat about his time at Harvard and his upcoming work.
The Harvard Crimson: Can you give us a summary of your career so far?
Tyler E. Spindel: Right after college I moved to New York to do stand-up comedy and then I stayed there a little less than a year doing standup. Then I got a writing gig on a movie out in LA and that kind of moved me out there. Ever since I’ve been in LA and I started getting into directing and writing and I was acting at the time too. I got some parts in movies and stuff but all small stuff.
And then I started directing and I stopped acting and I stopped doing standup comedy. Now I pretty much just write and direct. I directed the show “Chelsea Lately,” and did that for quite a few years. I did “The Jack and Triumph Show,” if you’ve ever seen that. A lot of Comedy Central stuff. And then over the past two years I’ve directed two movies. The first one is called “Deported” and that one is probably going to come out this year at some point. The one I just finished is called “Graduate” and we actually shot it right outside of Boston.
THC: Is that a movie for Netflix with David Spade?
TES: Yes, that’s the one.
THC: Did you move to New York immediately after graduating from Harvard?
TES: Yes, I moved straight to New York right after graduating. It was the best and there were a lot of Harvard people out there so it was fun. Then I got a gig out here in LA and I’ve been here ever since.
THC: How did your time at Harvard influence your career path?
TES: Well I actually started stand-up at Harvard. … I did a couple of shows at Harvard, which was fun. Me and my friends used to write skits and shoot skits out in Harvard Yard actually. I used to cast all my buddies and we used to shoot so much stuff in our dorm. I just kinda fell in love with it. It was actually at Harvard where … you started to kind of find your style and find out what you thought was funny. We used to shoot stuff all around the Square. I took some of the film classes too but I was a history major actually. 
THC: You’ve had a number of roles in Hollywood, including acting, directing, and producing. What is your favorite job and why?
TES: Definitely directing and I got to say this last movie that I just did. It was cool because we got to come back home and shoot because I’m from around there and it was cool to shoot where I grew up around Boston. I got to put my family in the movie too. 
THC: As Adam Sandler’s nephew, was comedy a natural career path for you?
TES: I think it was, but I don’t know. I liked a lot of things. I always thought I was going to be in business or something like that but then I started playing around with comedy. Once I started I couldn’t stop. But I would say yes.
THC: How do you separate yourself from his career and your own?
TES: Well it’s easy because I have a different last name. Honestly, I try to not tell people. I just try to be different. But listen, I would be lucky to have a career like him. Extremely lucky. But I try to write different style jokes than him, I try to do a little bit different style of humor. He’s been a huge influence on me. I honestly wouldn’t be out here if it wasn’t for him. 
THC: Is there another person besides Sandler in your life that you look up to?
TES: There’s been so many. Adam and my other uncle Scott who also works in the business as a lawyer and a producer. They’ve both been extremely instrumental in teaching me everything and guiding me through everything. 
THC: What have been your favorite projects so far?
TES: “Chelsea Lately”was the best. That was so much being able to shoot a show every day over a couple years. It was a really cool experience because you come up with an idea that morning and then you shoot it late morning, edit it in the afternoon, and then it’s on TV that night. It’s a pretty crazy experience and it was really fun. I got to work with so many talented people—pretty much every celebrity came on the show. It was unbelievable.
That was amazing, and then shooting these last two movies has been amazing, to direct something that I wrote with one of my good friends. Getting to do that was unbelievable too. it was so much fun. It’s kind of crazy to see something that you’ve conceived, shoot it and have it come out. It’s a pretty nutty feeling. 
THC: You have these two movies coming out soon. Are there any other projects that are in the works or that you are working on now?
TES: Well, the two movies are the big ones and now that I just finished post—which is the editing and cutting—I’ll get back to writing. I’m working on a pilot and I got to get started on that. It’s kind of a case-by-case basis industry, you kind of go one at a time. You work on one job really hard and then you take a little break until you get to the next one.

Harvard Management Company has seen a busy year. Under the leadership of N.P. Narvekar, the endowment manager whose internal structure was once critiqued as “lazy, fat and stupid” has now undergone great change in the midst of an often uncertain financial environment. HMC has laid off many employees while seeking to ultimately cut its staff in half, delegated work to various investment teams, and eliminated many internally-managed investments. Narvekar has not hesitated to make the required large-scale changes to improve HMC’s success. We commend him for moving forward with his ambitious agenda to decentralize the endowment, which he first set out to do in January.
It appears that Bain Capital is in talks to manage over half—about $5 billion worth—of the endowment’s current real estate portfolio. This is a significant change, especially as real estate saw the highest returns of any asset class in the past fiscal year. In addition, the transition to Bain will also involve roughly 20 hires from HMC, who will have the institutional expertise and familiarity that managing the endowment necessitates. We are glad there will be some continuity of institutional expertise in the portfolio’s management.
We are glad to see this further development within HMC and are interested to see how Harvard’s real estate holdings will fare in private hands. While Bain has not officially committed to this deal, we are cautiously optimistic that this decision will be good for the endowment. Regardless of the outcome, the performance of this change will serve as a bellwether for Narvekar’s agenda, providing a benchmark by which to rate his handling of the endowment. We, along with many others, will thus be closely watching Bain’s performance over the next few years.
We commend Narvekar for all he has done with Harvard’s endowment. As we have previously opined, he has quickly shown himself to be a dedicated and driven CEO. It is important to remember that this is only the first year of his tenure. While the endowment’s returns were low compared to those of other Ivy League schools, we are hopeful that in future years, Harvard’s finances will prosper. This outsourcing to Bain is an example of the long-term thinking that such a financial investment requires. For now, all we can do is wait.

Every third-grader can tell you that Batman has no superpowers. Bruce Wayne, Batman’s alter ego, has cool gadgets, lots of money, a helpful butler, and, occasionally, a leotard-sporting sidekick, but other than that, Batman’s ordinary. Unlike his peers in the DC comic book hero canon, he can’t fly, run at super-speed, or shoot lasers out of his eyes.
But somehow, he still manages to lead the world’s fiercest ensemble of superheroes—the Justice League. Judgements of its cinematic quality aside, the new Justice League movie illustrates this point. Batman heads the ship of super-aliens, cyborgs, mythic gods, and Amazon warriors, not because he’s the most powerful hero, but because he knows how to bring together—and keep together—the right people. He uses his strength of mind and character to recruit experts, and he knows his teammates well enough to delegate unpredictable problems to each person according to his or her expertise. Batman makes sure the right people punch the right meteors, and the world gets saved.
In its ongoing hunt for a new University president, Harvard seems to be searching for Superman. We want a practically omnipotent administrative one-person juggernaut studly enough to handle all the work himself or herself. We called for a racially diverse, emotionally intelligent, intellectually curious champion with lobbying skills, social scene savvy, financial know-how, and, ideally, a Ph.D. in something related to engineering. It seems as likely that any name in the presidential search committee’s 700-candidate-long list could hit all of those specifications as it is that Superman could actually reverse time by flying around the world at super-speed. Maybe this is a sign that Harvard’s thinking about the presidential search in the wrong way.
So far, we’ve directed most of our efforts toward finding the mystery man or woman who has the right profile to fill University President Drew G. Faust’s shoes. We focus on asking how this person is going to steer Harvard through the Trump administration’s higher education policies, a disastrous College social reform, a sinking endowment, and other turbulent SEAS. From all the discussions up to this point, it seems like we’re looking for a fearless leader from Krypton who can use all their super-strength to single-handedly shoulder these burdens.
In short, we’re thinking of the next president in isolation—as the sole leader responsible for all Harvard’s important decisions during their tenure. Instead, it’s time we start thinking of them in the context of what it’s actually like to lead a university.
We should see this person not as absolutist decision-maker, but as the head of a network, the captain of a team who works with their teammates, selects new teammates, and depends on those teammates for the deliberation and execution of decisions. Such administrative networks, after all, are the mechanisms of most University decision-making.
So instead of asking which candidate has all the necessary expertise, we should ask which candidate will best cooperate with Harvard’s current experts—the provosts, lobbyists, financial advisors, deans, and faculty members who are already best qualified to make the difficult decisions in Harvard’s future. Would the candidate be a collaborative, respected, and enthusiastic leader of these people? Would they genuinely care about building relationships, understanding each group and each person’s strengths, and delegating the right tasks to leverage those relationships in the service of a shared vision? Would they fill vacant positions with people who fit this collaborative network? Victory is won through many advisers, and we should stop asking which presidential candidates have the most qualifications and start asking which candidates are going to use, bring together, and keep together the best people.
These are complex questions, and no resume or interview will provide the necessary information to definitively answer them. What is certain, though, is that this ability to prioritize team networks over unilateral executive know-how requires a bigger share of humility and integrity than political experience or intellectual heft. Harvard Corporation senior fellow William F. Lee ’72 summed it up nicely: It’s a “question of character,” of who has the interpersonal mettle necessary to lead a collaborative team, not an autocracy.
The next University president is going to be all too human for our current superhuman expectations. They will not be remotely qualified enough to handle all the increasingly complex problems Harvard will confront in the coming years. But Batman isn’t Superman, and he doesn’t have to be. All he has to be is Superman’s friend. What makes Batman a model leader is the people he’s wise enough to surround himself with, respected and disciplined enough to keep around, and smart enough to use appropriately in solving the increasingly complex problems the Justice League faces when saving the world.
Harvard’s next president doesn’t have to have superpowers. They just need to be Batman.

Each year for World AIDS Day, the Harvard Global Health & AIDS Coalition gathers on the steps of Memorial Church in Harvard Yard to mourn the 35 million lives lost to HIV/AIDS. As the number of people living with HIV today nears 37 million, the vigil reminds us of how far we have come and how much work we have yet to do in the fight against this disease and the social inequities that perpetuate it.
While our coalition has no political affiliation, we view policy and progress through the lens of health justice. During the 2016 election cycle, we spoke to Democrats and Republicans alike to urge them to pledge to end the AIDS epidemic. We partnered with student groups in Iowa and New Hampshire and connected with candidates at town halls, state fairs, and backyard pig roasts during primary season. Along the way, we conversed with Marco Rubio, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz, and Jeb Bush. Each candidate had a plan for an AIDS-free generation; each candidate could speak to the importance of bilateral funding streams like PEPFAR and the Global Fund.
We remained hopeful that if we kept the pressure on we could make sure that the next President of the United States would support and expand the lifesaving programs that guarantee access to treatment for people around the world. At the time, we did not believe that Donald Trump could win the Republican nomination, let alone the general election. This assumption was our loss, and had we been able to anticipate his success, we would have pressed harder on his global health agenda. We would have asked Trump over and over again to fight AIDS with us.
AIDS activists of the 1980s and 1990s saved their own lives with treatment advocacy, demanding that life-saving medicines be released at affordable prices. Access to medicines remains a crucial issue in healthcare today. Both during his campaign and his first months in office, President Trump took a strong pro-patient position on drug pricing and the lobbying power of large pharmaceutical companies. He claimed that major drug companies were “getting away with murder” and advocated for government-negotiated drug pricing.
Then, last week Trump nominated Alex Azar to be the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Azar worked as Senior Vice President of Eli Lilly, a nearly $90 billion pharmaceutical company, whose most recognizable products are insulin treatments for diabetes. Under Azar’s leadership,  the company raised the prices of its most popular insulins by 7 to 20 percent each year between 2014 and 2016. The effects of Azar’s greed are fatal; diabetics who rely on insulin to manage their blood sugar have died as a result of the price hikes.
The tone deafness of Trump’s nomination of Azar in the context of America’s healthcare politics is not unusual. Trump has shown complete disinterest in listening to the voices of America’s most vulnerable: those suffering from illness or disabilities and their caregivers. The administration has encouraged repeated attempts by congressional Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which has insured nearly 20 million Americans. The new tax reform bill now threatens Medicare, the insurance that serves as the lifeline for our aging and ailing.
Attacks on women’s health are also centerpieces of the Trump agenda. So far the administration has backed bills that could reduce access to contraception, instate a ban on abortions after 20 weeks, and threaten women’s lives around the world with a dramatic expansion of the Mexico City Policy, also known as the Global Gag Rule. Moreover, Trump has placed Jared Kushner in charge of addressing the country’s opioid crisis. Kushner—having little political experience and no background in public health—is woefully unprepared to address an epidemic that affects over two million Americans.
All of these issues—access to medicines, women’s health, and substance use policies—intersect with AIDS, in that they disproportionately affect marginalized populations who lack access to robust health care systems. In order to curb the HIV/AIDS pandemic and prevent future health catastrophes, we must build the systems and the attitudes that will prevent such a fate. The U.S. is the biggest donor to the global AIDS response. When our politicians lack the courage to save the lives that we have the tools to save, it is our job to follow them, from Iowa to New Hampshire to the White House, to shake them out of their deadly complacency.
While we resist—this year, this presidential term, and for the rest of our lives—we must remember that although HIV/AIDS may feel like a crisis of the past, 37 million people depend on bilateral funding for treatment and prevention. Their lives cannot depend on the conceits of one politician in the Oval Office.
This year’s vigil will be held today, Friday, December 1 at 7:30 p.m. on the steps of Memorial Church in Harvard Yard.

Just over a week after Harvard students returned from the 134th annual Harvard-Yale football game, many were surprised to learn that next year’s showdown will not be at Harvard Stadium.
While some students say they’re excited by the move to Fenway Park—a measure taken to accommodate planned renovations to Harvard Stadium—others expressed concern about transportation, tailgating venues, changes to a longstanding tradition, and potentially lower student attendance.
James Lee ’21, who as a lineman on the Varsity football team could be taking the field at Fenway against the Bulldogs, welcomed the change.
“In my opinion, I think it will be better,” Lee said. “It’s that new excitement of going to a new place.”
Other students were less emphatic.
“I’m conflicted,” said Isabelle DeSisto ’20. “On the one hand, I really love Fenway Park. I think the atmosphere is awesome. I think it’s really cool that they have this opportunity. On the other hand, I think it will be logistically difficult.”
Other students also raised concerns about hosting the game so far away from Cambridge. Sophie B. Khorasani ’21 said the need for shuttles to the stadium—currently a necessity at the Yale Bowl, but not at Harvard Stadium—could complicate gameday.
“I think if they do a shuttle service then that might be sort of difficult because Boston might be busier than New Haven,” Khorasani said. “It's not the easiest thing to get into Boston.”
DeSisto said she worries that the extra travel time might depress attendance.
“The fact that it will be that much farther than over the river...means a lot more students won’t go,” she said.
James Allan ’21 also said Harvard Stadium’s “more local and more familiar” feel could deter some.
“But I think we’ll still get a good turnout at Fenway.” he said.
Matthew S. Miller ’21 worried that moving The Game from Harvard Stadium or the Yale Bowl for the first time since 1912 will undermine the match-up’s sense of tradition.
“I think this is the first time since the early 1900s that it hasn't been played at the school’s field and it is nice to have the stadium where the game is played so close to campus,” he said. “But at the same time it does bring some flair to it.”
Students also expressed concern that the move could take away from gameday festivities like tailgating. Typically, students and alumni eat and drink outside the stadium prior to kickoff. Heightened security at the Yale Bowl for this year’s game drew criticism from some for impeding House tailgates.
Emma L. Humphrey ’21 said “it doesn’t make a ton of sense” to tailgate at Fenway, which is located in a crowded part of Boston.
Allan said he is taking an optimistic, “glass half full” approach, though, saying he hoped the Crimson could break their two-year losing streak at Fenway.
“It will be a cool atmosphere, a once in a lifetime opportunity, and, who knows, maybe Harvard will come out with some surprises,” he said.

With reading period starting on Saturday, staying up late and missing meals won't be the only schedule adjustments undergraduates make as they prepare for final exams.
Some libraries on campus are changing their hours and accessibility to accommodate the deluge of cranky students cramming at the last minute before their exams.
From when it opens at 9 a.m. on Saturday, Lamont Library will remain open for 24 hours a day until the end of final exams—a yearly practice that extends the library’s weekend hours in an effort to provide students with quiet study spaces before the College’s exam period begins.
During the semester, Lamont is open 24 hours from Monday through Thursday. Lamont serves as a research library and study space for all Harvard ID card holders.
But not all Harvard libraries are extending their hours in preparation for reading period: Cabot Library, the Kennedy School of Government Library, and several others will maintain their usual hours throughout the week.
The Law School’s library will not change its hours during reading period, but it will limit which students may study there, according to Harvard Law School Library Executive Director Jocelyn Kennedy.
“During fall and spring reading and exam periods, HUID access to the Harvard Law School Library is limited to Harvard Law School students, faculty and staff” according to the Harvard Law School Library website. Other HUID card holders "must check in at the Circulation Desk for access.”
Some undergraduates plan on utilizing the extra hours at Lamont, while others say they will miss studying in the Law School’s library.
Jillian T. McEneaney ’21 said she “uses the Law School library as quiet place to study away from the stressed undergraduates that are always in Lamont."
“I am disappointed that I won’t be able to study for my exams there,” she said. She added that she will likely be “spending more time in Lamont” because of the extended hours.
Isaiah O. S. J. Michalski ’21 said he splits his studying time between Cabot and Lamont libraries.
“Cabot seems better suited for STEM related studies, while Lamont has a very cozy humanities atmosphere,” he said. During reading period, he said he plans to mainly continue splitting his study time between the two libraries.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As some Harvard graduate students have loudly opposed a Republican tax proposal that could slash students’ earnings, others say they are concerned about the plan’s “devastating” elimination of deductions for interest on student loans.
While some Harvard graduate students—including all Ph.D. students—receive full tuition support from the University, many undergraduate and professional school students take out loans to fund parts of their education.  The striking of the deduction, which allows eligible students to write off up to $2,500 of student loan interest from their taxes, could particularly affect students who neither receive grants from the University nor have outside funding to cover their tuition.
“By targeting student loans, this bill devalues the role that education and research plays in our society by hitting low-income students most unable to afford an education with liabilities they already struggle with,” wrote Harvard Graduate Council president Kevin Tian in an emailed statement.
Students said they are concerned that eliminating the loan deduction would disproportionately impact low-income and minority students.
“Many of the students who are part of the African American community here are first-generation college students or first generation middle-class students,” said Victoria Asbury, a graduate student in Sociology. “Many of our families don’t have the wealth to finance our education. This tax plan is going to make it so that they have even less money to help.”
While Harvard’s undergraduate financial aid program boasts a “no loan” policy, hundreds of students every year still take out loans to cover the costs of their education. For example, roughly 300 students in the Class of 2015 took out loans during their time at Harvard, Sally C. Donahue, Harvard’s financial aid director, said in 2015.
Donahue added that the average debt at graduation was just over $5,200, compared to a national average of $35,051.
Law School student Suzanne Schlossberg said that the striking of the loan interest deduction would also discourage students from pursuing lower-paying jobs in the public sector after graduation. In the Law School Class of 2016, the average student loan debt burden was $153,172, according to the Law School’s website.
“By taxing tuition assistance and eliminating the student loan interest deduction, this plan will harm students, public interest lawyers, and the individuals and communities they serve,” wrote Schlossberg, who serves on the Law School’s student government.
Kenneth Lafler, the Law School’s assistant dean for student financial services, wrote in an email that loan interest deductions are important for making tuition affordable for Law School students.
“Graduate students already pay higher interest rates than undergraduates to borrow from the federal government, and in recent years the cost of borrowing has increased even further due to the elimination of subsidized federal loans for graduate students,” Lafler wrote.
The House’s proposal also separately strikes the exemption for “qualified tuition reductions” given by a University to its employees and paid graduate students.  By including these reductions as a part of income, the bill could potentially increase some graduate students’ taxes as much as four-fold, according to a tax law expert.  The Senate’s bill, however, preserves both the loan interest deduction and the tuition exemption.
Student criticism of the tax bill comes as other Harvard affiliates also advocate against it. On her latest trip to Washington, D.C., University President Drew G. Faust urged members of Congress to vote against the plan. In recent weeks, she has spoken to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer '71, and alumni in Congress about the bill.
On Wednesday, Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers, Harvard’s student unionization effort, organized a rally and phone bank against the Republican-led plan. Union supporters called their representatives and told them not to support the tax bill.
The House passed its version of the bill earlier this month. Meanwhile, the Senate has crafted a separate version  of the bill, which it could vote on as early as Friday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard College Reproductive Justice Action & Dialogue Collective staged on Thursday evening its third annual reading of “Out of Silence,” a collection of scenes that tackle individuals’ experiences with abortion.
RAD members and non-members—including current Harvard students and one College alumnus—performed in the show, which stretched for roughly an hour and a half. Afterwards, producers and performers hosted a question-and-answer session.
“We are interested in sharing real abortion narratives just to destigmatize abortion, to bring humanity, compassion, and empathy to this topic,” producer and RAD co-President Caroline N. Goldfarb ’18 said of the event.
“Out of Silence” is sponsored by the “1 in 3 campaign,” a grassroots movement that works to empower women to share stories about abortion and to eliminate societal stigma and shame associated with the procedure.
This year’s showing marks the third year RAD has hosted the reading at Harvard, according to Goldfarb. The campaign worked with ten female playwrights in 2015 to craft 13 abortion vignettes—inspired by real stories—and compiled them into the script for "Out of Silence."
“With abortion the narratives that we hear are sometimes driven by anti-choice rhetoric or have very specific stories,” said Solange N. Azor ’18, who acted in this year’s production. “People don’t realize one in three women have an abortion and the reasons for that experience are really varied.”
Azor performed in a vignette called “Charlie,” which depicts a lesbian couple who decide to have an abortion for medical reasons. Azor said she thinks the vignette helps show that anyone, regardless of gender, can have an abortion at some point in their lives.
Constance M. Bourguignon ’20, who also acted in the reading, said she thinks public discourse about abortion is often limited to the same stories “over and over again”—like rape scenarios.
“I think that this [performance] does a good job of showing stories of abortion that are outside of these tropes,” Bourguignon said.
Susan Fendell, a Somerville resident who acted in the performance, said she first became involved in RAD’s production three years ago because she found the vignettes moving.
“I think it’s really important that we get people talking about their experiences with abortion,” Fendell said. “I’m glad there is a younger generation carrying on this work, but I am sad that the fight for abortion rights is still a fight.”

As she prepares to step down from the job Sunday, Undergraduate Council President Yasmin Z. Sachee '18 said one of the proudest accomplishments of her year-long tenure was funding “bridge programs” for freshmen during Opening Days.
“Seeing what student groups came up with to welcome freshmen was really, really special and I’m really, really happy with that,” she said. Sachee and UC Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia worked with the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations to fund social events for dozens of student groups to welcome first-year students.
Sachee said she was also proud of an initiative that created a centralized “Q guide” to evaluate different student groups’ comp processes. She said she hopes the guide will spark further conversation surrounding issues of inclusivity inherent in Harvard's comp system.
“I feel like we’ve begun a really important dialogue and put data and people’s actual comments on paper or on website, by which hopefully this can go forth into the future,” she said.
UC Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 said he thinks he and Sachee broadly achieved their campaign promises to support freshmen, improve social experiences, and enhance College life in general. He and Sachee ran in November 2016 on a campaign centered on those three tenets, which they dubbed “arriving, vibing, thriving."
“Everyone goes in knowing it’s impossible to accomplish all of those,” he said. “I think we’re really pleased with the fact that in each of those main areas, two of which Yaz mentioned, we were able to kind of tick off the biggest one.”
Sachee said that had duo had more free time, they would have spent it advocating for Drug and Alcohol Peers Advisors to become more involved in on-campus parties.
Khansarinia also said he and Sachee recently met with House Faculty Deans to discuss reinvigorating social life in upperclassmen Houses. He said he believes these conversations will improve House social life going forward.
“I think we set the stage for a lot of those party things to happen in the Houses,” he said. “We may not have accomplished it, but we laid the groundwork for that to keeping going forward.”
Ahead of UC President-elect Catherine L. Zhang ’19 and Vice President-elect Nicholas D. Boucher ’19’s swearing-in this Sunday, Sachee said she’s excited for the new leaders.
Zhang is “such an incredible, caring, and inspiring leader. I think she is really going to take the Council to new directions," she said. "And Nick has done wonders for the Council on the tech side, and I think incorporating his tech knowledge into some further Council projects could be really, really exciting for the Council."
"So I’m excited for them,” she said.
Khansarinia said he thinks Zhang and Boucher’s respective leadership styles mean the duo will make a good team.
“I think it’s the perfect combination of the optimist and the technocrat and they’re going to balance each other very well and use those two personalities to get a lot done,” Khansarinia said.
Sachee and Khansarinia said they plan to meet with Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana sometime in the next week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The retention rate for female faculty in science, engineering, and mathematics departments at Harvard is almost 20 percent lower than it is for male faculty, according to an internal report compiled by a group of professors.
Frustrated by what they saw as a gap between official Faculty of Arts and Sciences data and their personal experiences, two professors—Computer Science professor Radhika Nagpal and Organismic and Evolutionary Biology chair Elena M. Kramer—spent months gathering data on over 150 Harvard professors in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and 10 STEM departments. The two women, working with several other professors who did not want to be publicly identified, found that Harvard’s retention rate for women in STEM from 2000 to 2015 was 44 percent, compared to 62 percent for men.
In November 2016, Nagpal and Kramer sent their report to several top administrators, including Dean for Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, and University President Drew G. Faust. The two women also sent the report to all Faculty members in SEAS and the departments.
Nagpal and Kramer said some administrators responded privately to their report, though they said they would have preferred a more public response.
“It’s been a crazy time, with all the problems being handed down to us by the Trump administration, so I’m not surprised there has not been much,” Nagpal wrote in an emailed statement. “But now we need to start doing more—and we can’t just do the same things we did the past ten years and expect things to turn out any differently.”
Through spokespeople, Smith and Faust declined to comment for this story. Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement on Zipser's behalf that “the FAS has responded to and addressed this important issue in many Dean's annual reports.”
Dane pointed to the 2015 and 2016 dean’s reports in particular, which both show that a higher percentage of women than men did not come up for tenure review from 2003 to 2013. While Harvard's official report tracks data across all of FAS, Nagpal and Kramer focused on SEAS and 10 additional departments: Organismic and Evolutionary Biology (now titled Integrative Biology), Molecular and Cellular Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Astronomy, Statistics, Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Earth and Planetary Sciences, Human Evolutionary Biology, and Mathematics.

Nagpal and Kramer honed in on junior Faculty members, or those who have yet to come up for tenure. The two women found that 69 percent of female junior faculty stayed long enough to come up for tenure review, compared to 84 percent of male junior Faculty members.
Nagpal and Kramer called this statistic “the most dramatic disparity revealed by the study.”
Overall, the report showed that 29 percent of STEM faculty hired by Harvard between 2000 and 2015 were female.
Previous dean’s reports have focused on the issue of gender disparity in faculty tenure appointments at Harvard. The 2016 report revealed that 65 percent of women came up for tenure review from 2000 to 2013, while 78 percent of men did so.
“Our historical analysis in last year’s report showed that a smaller percentage of women remain on the tenure track through their tenure review,” administrators wrote in the 2016 report. “This fact is correlated with the outcome that women are not attaining tenure at the same rate as men.”
The 2016 report notes that the Faculty began a “major push” in academic year 2015-2016 to address these issues of attrition, including working to improve mentorship and professional development programs for tenure-track faculty at Harvard.
In the introduction to their report, Nagpal and Kramer acknowledged that past dean’s reports have highlighted Harvard’s struggles to retain female professors. But the two said they think Harvard will be better able to solve these issues if they can rely on department-specific data like the statistics given in their report.
“This kind of directly comparable data will help departments to evaluate their performance and identify problem areas,” Nagpal and Kramer wrote in their report.
Nagpal and Kramer said they decided to create the report after watching scores of female friends working in STEM departments decide to leave the University.
“It’s been heartbreaking for me,” Nagpal wrote in an emailed statement. “That’s the simplest I can put it.”
One year, Kramer said five of her female colleagues, all good friends, left in one go—prompting Kramer and others to host a goodbye party.
“We had this going away party, and it was just really depressing to see all of these really fantastic women leave the institution,” Kramer said. “The tenure-track women who were still here were all feeling very demoralized.”

Ten years ago, Lawrence S. Bacow was on the shortlist of candidates for the 28th President of Harvard University. This time around, he’ll be making the shortlist in another way—as a member of the Harvard Corporation, which is leading the search for the 29th.
As former president of Tufts University—just north of Harvard—and a former chancellor at MIT, Bacow brings deep expertise in higher education to the presidential search committee.
“Larry is a national leader in higher education, and has a deep understanding of both the challenges and opportunities that universities face today,” Anthony P. Monaco, Bacow’s successor at Tufts, wrote in an email.
In some ways, Bacow’s time in academic administration echoes that of Harvard’s current University President Drew G. Faust: Both steered their institutions through the 2008 financial crisis, sought to consolidate the central governance at their respective universities, and fulfilled the role of fundraiser-in-chief.
Bacow’s speeches as an academic leader also hint at priorities in line with Faust’s—suggesting he may be looking for a leader ready to continue her agenda. At the time of his Tufts presidential inauguration in 2002, Bacow set out three major priorities for the university: moving towards an education that stresses global thinking, “teaching collaboration as a way of life,” and centralizing governance structures across Tufts’ eight schools.
“How do we educate leaders for a truly global world? By teaching collaboration as a way of life—and a source of answers,” Bacow said in 2002. “By bringing together research and education in ways that could not be accomplished anywhere else."
Faust, too, has operated under a “One Harvard” philosophy that seeks to tie together the University’s long-independent schools. And in her decade-long tenure, Faust has pushed forward Harvard’s global initiatives, opening new international research centers and overseeing the creation of the continent-spanning Global Advisory Council.
Bacow’s close proximity to undergraduate life at Tufts also suggests he may prioritize candidates who hail from the higher education sphere and show a commitment to his ideals of university education.
“We need to be attentive to the entire realm of the undergraduate experience," Bacow said at his inauguration. “Today, colleges and universities everywhere are rushing to define themselves as ‘student-centered.’ At Tufts, we can say with confidence and pride that we already are.”
During his tenure, Bacow regularly dealt with issues of undergraduate social life. One Tufts tradition in particular, the Naked Quad Run—which draws inebriated undergraduates to campus thoroughfares en masse—prompted two separate campus-wide memos from his office. When it became clear that the tradition posed a serious safety concern to students, he moved to abolish it altogether.
While Harvard’s similar Primal Scream tradition has continued largely unchallenged, the next University president will also likely have to grapple with undergraduate social life. Before she leaves, Faust will hand down a decision on the fate of Harvard’s single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations, which she may choose to penalize or ban altogether. William F. Lee ’72, the Corporation’s senior fellow, has said the next president will likely stick with Faust’s decision.
In any case, though, search committee members will likely look to Bacow’s years of experience leading a large Massachusetts university as they narrow down the pool for Harvard’s next president.
“His expertise and knowledge will be a great asset to the search committee,” Monaco wrote.

With nine minutes left in the first half, the Harvard bench looked up at the scoreboard at Matthews Arena with despair. The team had  put up just 11 points in the half and trailed the Huskies by 21.
Despite a spirited late first-half run that saw the Crimson come within seven to close the period, the Harvard men’s basketball team was ultimately unable to bring the game to a close score late and fell 77-61 to Northeastern on the road.
The Crimson (3-5) struggled mightily from beyond the arc, going just 3-for-17 on the night. The tough shooting would do little to improve the 0.287 mark held by Harvard entering the game, and appeared to be the one of the biggest concerns for coach Tommy Amaker’s drive-and-kick offense.
“It’s demoralizing when you can’t make open shots,” Amaker said. “It is surprising that we haven’t been able to shoot the ball better from the perimeter than we have shown thus far. We are hoping that at some point [making threes] will help us and obviously tonight it was a good reason why we weren’t able to generate any offense.”
Northeastern (3-4) started the contest with two easy layups in the paint, while Harvard turned the ball over on three back-to-back possessions. This start was largely a harbinger for the remainder of the half.
The Crimson struggled to find any offensive consistency in the opening ten minutes. At the 11:18 mark, Northeastern held a 24-11 lead and was four-for-six from three-point range. By comparison, the Crimson had already tallied six turnovers and had just one assist.
Throughout the night Harvard looked to sophomore point guard Bryce Aiken and sophomore forward Chris Lewis to generate offense for the team throughout the game. Aiken and Lewis combined for 46 of the Crimson’s 61 points, while the Harvard bench only contributed four points.
“[Aiken] is just so quick and shifty on the ball,” Huskies coach Bill Coen said. “He is almost impossible to guard. We knew Lewis would be big inside...those are two players we didn’t have great matchups on, but we worked at it and we didn’t let the other guys get free [shots].”
A late 15-2 run by the Crimson gave Amaker’s team some rejuvenation heading into the locker room.
Down 14 points with two minutes to go in the first half, sophomore forward Robert Baker found Aiken at the left corner. Aiken knocked down that bucket, and later pick-pocketed freshman guard Tomas Murphy before dishing it to sophomore forward Justin Bassey for the easy layup in the waning seconds of the first half
Compared to the disastrous start, a seven points first half deficit gave the Crimson momentum heading into the locker room. The late run would prove to be as close as Harvard would get, however.
Northeastern held steady for most of the second half, extending the lead to 60-46 with 7:28 left in the contest. Redshirt junior Vasa Pusica led the Huskies with 22 points, shooting 3-for-5 from beyond the arc.
The Crimson also encountered challenges on the defensive end in the second half, allowing both easy baskets at the rim and giving perimeter weapons like Pusica room to shoot. Northeastern snatched 13 offensive rebounds and scored 32 of its 77 points from the paint in the contest.
Coming off a difficult week and recovering from illness, sophomore forward Seth Towns was a non-factor for the Crimson and would play just 11 minutes in the game. Shooting 1-of-6 from the field, Towns was left on the bench by Amaker to start the second half and never was able to gain traction on the offensive end, particularly on isolation plays.
“I thought he really hurt us.” Amaker said. “He’s got to be better for us if we are going to have the team we are supposed to have. We are disappointed in his effort and he did not play well at all.”
Harvard was never able to recover from its second-half hole, and ultimately turned to its bench players after the Huskies extended its lead to 15 with 2:39 left in the game. Freshman forward Reed Farley and Rio Haskett saw some action off the bench, but combined to go 1-of-7 from the field on the night.
“We are trying to get them involved but if we can’t make open baskets, there is nothing else we can do,” Amaker said. “[Aiken and Lewis] need help. Right now we are not getting it from the other guys.”

Men’s basketball hit the road over Thanksgiving break, heading to California to sample the best of the West Coast. In honor of the trip, here are the best tweets of the week from current and former Harvard men’s basketball players:
7.) Freshman forward Danilo Djuricic
“Does not matter without the win... just trying to help this team do that! Time to bounce back tomorrow.”
Great team attitude, Danilo!
6.) Sophomore standout Bryce Aiken
“If there isn’t a way then make one.”
Inspiring advice, Bryce—true of life as well as the Harvard concentration options.
5.) Freshman guard Rio Haskett
“If it ain’t rough it ain’t right”
“We run things, things don’t run us.” 
I can’t tell you exactly what Rio means here, but I can say that he is clearly wise beyond his freshman years.
4.) Junior forward Weisner Perez
“I’m so thankful and blessed to be where I’m at in life. Didn’t get the opportunity to go home for thanksgiving, but instead got to spend it with the Harvard Basketball family.  #LaFamilia” 
Great attitude toward the road trip, Weisner! Way to show off that upperclassman maturity. I personally would throw a fit if anyone tried to take away my Thanksgiving holiday.
3.) Senior forward Chris Egi
“Day 1” 
Day 1 of what Chris??? Day 1 of what??? Clearly, the senior and academic standout has reached a level where mere mortals cannot understand his tweets.
2.) Sophomore forward Henry Welsh
 “I cast my Heisman ballot for #BryceLove! Click the player you think deserves the @NissanUSA #HeismanHouse vote!”
I’m more of a Baker Mayfield man, but who can blame Henry—Love sure can run it. Not sure how Henry’s brother, Tom, of the UCLA Basketball team feels about Henry throwing his Heisman support to a PAC-12 Rival.
1.) Men’s basketball alum Wesley Saunders, formerly of the Knicks D-League team and currently playing professional basketball in Finland
“Well I know what I’m doing for my birthday #TheIncredibles2”
I guess now we all know how Wes has been spending his time in Finland. Hopefully he can find a Finnish theater to give him what he wants.

HAMDEN, Conn. — A reeling Harvard men’s hockey team made some promising strides over Thanksgiving break against Boston College. At some point, however, these improvements are futile if the wins don’t start coming.
After a 2-5-1 start to the season, the Crimson (3-5-1, 3-3-0 ECAC) battled Quinnipiac (6-8-1, 3-5-0) in dire need of a win—nothing more, nothing less, just the two conference points. And a victory is exactly what Harvard earned on Friday night, as the visiting Crimson edged a physical and relentless Bobcats team, 6-2. Harvard picks up its first tick in the win column since a November 4th shutout against Brown.
“It’s something to build on,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We found out that if we can make some simple smart plays, we’ll still be able to have some good offensive chances…. Good win for us, and it’s much needed.”
While the score would indicate a lopsided affair, two of Harvard’s goals came in the final minute when the game was all but decided. Quinnipiac actually paced the two teams in offensive chances, significantly outshooting the Crimson, 43-30.
A two-goal disparity held for much of the contest after the visitors jumped out to a 3-1 first-period lead, with both teams adding a goal early in the third period.
The contest began with some uncertainty, as fans saw a new starter in Harvard’s net for the first time in almost two years. Coach Donato opted to start junior Michael Lackey instead of tri-captain Merrick Madsen, Harvard’s usual number-one backstop. Because Madsen started all 36 games for the Crimson last season, the change between the pipes ended a 55-game start streak for the senior.
“We thought that we deserved to give somebody a chance to play,” coach Donato said. “We wanted more competition…. We’re at a spot now where we’re still trying to form our identity as a team, and guys that go in and play the best are going to be rewarded with playing time.”
The uncertainty did not stop there, though. Lackey, who sat out last season due to a hip injury, was playing his first minutes of the season on Friday night. He hardly had time to settle in before a puck found its way past him.
Just four minutes into the contest, Quinnipiac forward Matt Forchuk came up with the puck at the corner to Lackey’s right. The freshman threw the puck toward the cage, where linemate Nick Jermain got a stick on it and redirected it to the back of the net.
“That was a tip in the top corner, so I didn’t really fret that much about it,” Lackey said. “The adrenaline was pumping a lot at the beginning…. Once I settled down and started making some saves, I calmed down a little bit and just focused on the next shot.”
Despite his apparent shakiness in the first five minutes, Lackey settled in and played a stellar game in the paint.

“Obviously it was his first game back in a long time, and I couldn’t be happier for him,” junior forward Ryan Donato said. “At the end of the day it’s a long hockey game, and obviously its tough seeing [the goal] go in early, but he kind of battled back and stayed composed.”
Harvard responded with two goals before the first half of the period was over and chipped in another with just three minutes remaining in the frame.
To open the scoring for the Crimson, senior blue-liner Wiley Sherman fired a rocket from the point, which made it through Donato and a few Bobcat defensemen before finding twine.
Just two minutes after Sherman’s first of the year, Donato took advantage of a fortuitous puck that remained playable low in the zone thanks to the skate of a referee. From behind the goal line, the center drove hard to the net and punched one past sophomore goaltender Andrew Shortridge.
By potting a goal in the opening frame of his hat trick performance, Donato extended his season-long point streak to nine games, during which stretch he has recorded seven goals and six assists. The Boston Bruins draft pick added another goal mid-way through the third period on a wrap-around before completing the hat trick on an empty-netter.
Seven minutes later, junior forward Lewis Zerter-Gossage padded the Harvard lead on snipe to the top-right corner. The winger faked a slap shot in the high slot before skating in and firing the bullet.
“We were trailing to start, but we kept making right decisions with the puck,” coach Donato said. “We didn’t make trouble for ourselves. Quinnipiac is talented enough, they’re going to make trouble for us.”
Allowing three first-period goals was somewhat uncharacteristic of Shortridge, who entered the ECAC showdown with an impressive .924 save percentage and 1.89 goals against average—his numbers are even better, albeit marginally, in the first period.
While the score remained intact in the second frame, each side continued to earn high-quality scoring chances, and the physicality continued. A series of big collisions escalated the action in the scoreless period.
Tri-captain Jake Horton ended multiple shifts visibly upset at the referees’ lax style. Through two periods, no penalties had been called on either team.
“[Jake Horton] looks like a Civil War hero in [the locker room],” coach Donato said. “He’s got cuts all over his forehead…. I didn’t find it to be an overly dirty game. Both teams were playing hard, finishing their checks, and there [weren’t] many penalties in the game.”
Mere seconds into the third frame, the officials finally booked the first penalty of the night by sending off senior forward Tanner MacMaster for roughing. The chippy play only continued, however, as a scuffle between Lackey and a Bobcat forward trailing the play warranted intervention from the referees and jeers from the fans.
The Crimson now finds itself trying to build a winning streak—a surprisingly unfamiliar position for the squad this season—and will take on Princeton on Saturday night in search of its first four-point weekend of the 2017-2018 campaign.
“It stinks that we had to take so long to get back into our winning routine, but it feels really good,” Ryan Donato said.

Harvard Athletics, in the wise words of Avril Lavigne, why’d you have to go and make things so complicated? There are many reasons why the Game should not be played at Fenway. Here are a few:
Capacity
One would think that giving free tickets to an entire undergraduate-base of students, charging less than a meal at Clover for non-college affiliate tickets, and the presence of house-sponsored tailgates would lead to a full Harvard Stadium for the Game, right? WRONG. Despite a  centuries-long rivalry, the Game never sells out. Moving from Harvard Stadium (capacity of 30,000) to Fenway (capacity of 37,000) will only further depress attendants as they look around to see grandstands of empty seats. This isn’t Clemson vs. Miami, and the argument for the Stadium lacking sufficient capacity is ungrounded.
Transportation
Walking back to your room across the JFK Bridge with a stomach full of Keystone and Franzia at 1 p.m. is the most physically taxing thing (MY FRIENDS NOT ME MOM OK) have ever done. Shuttling out buses of inebriated students to Fenway seems like an even greater logistical nightmare. It adds costs of renting buses, paying drivers, and hiring people to clean up the botched shotguns Brad and Nathan spilled throughout Yawkey Way. It’s far from campus. It’s messy. It’s an Uber surge-pricing hellscape.
The Saybrook Strip
Unlike Yale police officers, cops at Fenway will like...actually arrest the students that get nude in the third quarter (assuming they haven’t left yet, or even entered the Game in the first place). But if you’re scheming to do away with your sloppy roommate, feel free to use this to your advantage.
Public Embarrassment
Townies already think that Harvard kids are huge dorks. Half of a sloshed Delta Gamma running around, tripping over their Steve Madden sandals in the middle of Boston won’t change their minds. If the Boston Globe gets a glimmer of a freshman peeing on Pesky’s Pole, you can imagine the Facebook arguments surfacing regarding the intellect of Harvard students.
Rushing the Field
Multiple Yale students broke their legs jumping down to rush the field from a 12-foot drop because they’re not used to engaging in physical activity and are brittle. Can you imagine kids rushing the field from the top of the Green Monster? I’m not saying that this is likely, but get a couple Four Lokos in you, and anything seems possible.
The Game at Harvard is fantastic because a student can wake up, walk to the Stadium, and be back in bed before kickoff. It’s local fun that allows students to tailgate on (read: trash) the facilities across the river, and easily hop over to the Stadium (or not). Fenway complicates and tarnishes the Game’s biggest asset when held in Cambridge—convenience. Why change over a century of a good thing?

It’s officially December, which means it is now 100% holiday cheer time.  Here are some ideas for spreading the love among your roommates, friends, and strangers!
Decorations
Break out the Christmas trees, menorahs, kinaras, streamers and other holiday decorations.  Just for some ideas, you can go classic “Ho Ho Ho,” or a more dangerous “Hoe Hoe Hoe.”
Secret Santa/Secret Gifts
Gather your friends and do a Secret Santa!  Just make sure to kick out the person who suggests a $10 limit for the gift.  Seriously, NO ONE likes waiting in anticipation for their Secret Santa gift, only to find a chocolate bar.
Caroling
Go around your dorm with your friends singing holiday carols!  If people are annoyed by it, then just sing louder, even if you’re not the greatest singer on the planet.  No one can call you out for caroling during the holiday season!
Staying Warm
Bundle up with that ugly sweater and turn up the heat.  Or, alternatively, drink wine until you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.  You’ll be all the happier either way.
Dance Around to “All I Want for Christmas Is You” in Your Undies
After warming yourself up, trust me, this is bound to happen.
Then Cry to “All I Want for Christmas Is You” in Your Undies
If you’ve had a break-up recently (recently being in the past 5 years) and are single, just cry to this song and have a friend bring over Insomnia Cookies and more wine.  You’ll feel better, we promise.

In his childhood, Scott A. Abell ’72 overcame polio and grew up in Ohio with “very, very modest means,” according to his son. Now, he’s one of the three members of the Board of Overseers on the search committee currently choosing Harvard’s next president.
Abell’s son, Patrick Abell ’07, said that his father’s commitment to the University has always been palpable. Scott Abell, the current president of the Board of Overseers, has previously served as president of the Harvard Alumni Association and the dean for development for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
“In the alumni association, and later in the development office for FAS, I think he’s always been a lead-by-example sort of person, where you look out for what’s best for the university, and you treat people well,” Patrick Abell said.
Abell’s professional background is in the fields of financial services and healthcare consulting—he founded Abell & Associates, Inc. in Ohio in 1973, and has served as its chair and CEO for nearly 30 years. As a philanthropist, he’s served as a trustee of several medical care providers; as a Harvard Overseer, he has served on the committee on natural and applied sciences and the visiting committees for a variety of departments in the Sciences division.
His expertise in fundraising will be an asset to the search committee: the Harvard president’s role includes serving as the University’s fundraiser-in-chief, and committee members will likely look for candidates with the ability to court wealthy donors and grow the school’s endowment.
After graduating from Kirkland House over four decades ago, Abell’s involvement as an alumnus began with his local Harvard Club in northeastern Ohio. Abell is still involved in the chapter—he’s been a featured speaker multiple times at club dinners, including one last month, at which he discussed the presidential search, according to the club’s website.
“I think he felt a lot of obligation to pay Harvard back and to pay it forward in the community,” Patrick Abell said. “I think he just always wanted to be a good steward of the school and a good ambassador for the school in the Cleveland area.”
This is not the first time that Abell has seen a presidential search at Harvard. While Abell was serving as the FAS dean for development, former University President Lawrence H. Summers resigned from his post, prompting the search that ultimately selected University President Drew G. Faust’s for the position.
James M. Griffin ’64, an officer of the Harvard Club of Northeast Ohio who has worked with Abell, said Abell kept the local Club informed with the goings-on of the presidential turnover in 2006.
“He spoke to us about what was going on at Harvard with Larry Summers’ resignation and the turmoil going on in the ranks of the deans and the department heads, and the search for the interim president for Summers,” Griffin said.
As for what he brings to the search committee table in 2017, Griffin said Abell’s years of service to the University have given him substantial institutional knowledge of all things Harvard.
“He has been an absolutely magnificent vehicle for what’s going on at Harvard,” Griffin said. “He seems to have an encyclopedic knowledge of what’s going on and all the parts of the university."

William F. Lee ’72 may be the most influential member of the committee leading the search for Harvard’s next president, but he wouldn’t be the one to tell you that.
 Lee, the senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation and chair of the presidential selection committee, is one of only two searchers to have served on the body that selected current University President Drew G. Faust. He's worked with Faust throughout her entire tenure and has remained one of her most vocal champions.
Now, as Harvard goes through that process again, he will offer unique insight to other committee members about what qualifications they should consider when choosing Faust’s successor.
An intellectual property lawyer who has litigated such high-profile cases as the “smartphone wars” between Apple and Samsung, Lee previously served as the Managing Partner of the powerhouse firm WilmerHale. He was elected to Harvard’s second-highest governance board, the Board of Overseers, in 2002, and was appointed the senior fellow of the Corporation in 2014.
He has spent much of his professional career in courtrooms, not classrooms, but his colleagues nonetheless praise his experience in higher education.
A. Douglas Melamed, a law professor at Stanford who recently co-authored an essay with Lee, said that while he and Lee have never chatted explicitly about Lee’s role on Harvard’s governing boards, he knows Lee is very “knowledgeable” about Harvard and its place in the higher education world.
Melamed added that he marvels at Lee’s ability to balance high-profile legal cases and his roles at the University.
“He does several trials a year, mostly as a litigator of big-stakes trials,” Melamed said. “This is a guy who is enormously productive as a lawyer in terms of hours, time, success, and business, and yet still has time to be on the Harvard Corporation and have that energy and productivity without ever making an enemy.”
While most of his colleagues said they had not spoken with Lee about issues in higher education that are important to him, it is possible to trace a rough sketch of the topics he privileges based on his tenure on Harvard’s governance boards thus far.
For example, it is possible Lee will consider candidates whose qualifications straddle the business and academic spheres.
“We’ve evolved now to the point where we’re much closer to a fiduciary organization, where Drew is—the word CEO does not seem to fit for an academic organization, but that’s what she is,” Lee said in an April interview. “She’s the CEO and the leader. The person who articulates the strategy and the vision should be her.”
At the time of Faust’s announcement of her departure, Lee said the University would be looking for continuity.
“In terms of her successor, we’re in a wonderful place right now. There’s been enormous progress made in the last decade, there’s been enormous progress made in the past year, and we’ll be looking for someone who can carry forth the progress that’s been made, and who has the kind of visions she had for the University,” Lee said.
Lee’s role on the Corporation has been significant: He helped spearhead efforts in 2010 to radically revise the Corporation’s governance structure, expanding its membership from seven to 13 and formalizing pathways of collaboration with the Overseers.
His colleagues from other law firms say Lee employs an unassuming and earnest leadership style in the courtroom and at the boardroom table. Joan A. Lukey, a partner at the Boston-based firm Choate Hall & Stewart, said her colleague of 30 years was fiercely intelligent but “relaxed” when interacting with co-workers.
“One of the moments that stick out in my memory: He was answering his phone, and his office wasn’t far from mine. And I hear him say ‘oh please, don’t call me Mr. Lee, that’s my father,’” Lukey said. “He’s laid back in that sense. Intense in the courtroom and in the litigation process, but on a personal level a very relaxed and friendly person.”
Lukey said that Lee initially had reservations about becoming Managing Partner at WilmerHale, largely because he was just getting his own intellectual property practice going. He split responsibilities at WilmerHale with an associate managing partner.
“However he did it, the firm grew and prospered at the same time that his practice became [one of] the best IP practices in the country,” Lukey said. “And that’s pretty phenomenal to run a huge firm at the same time that you grow your own practice.”

When Kenneth I. Chenault steps down as the CEO of American Express early next year, he’ll have at least one activity to fill his recently-opened schedule: searching for Harvard’s 29th president.
Widely praised as a business leader, Chenault, 66, will draw on his unusually long tenure at the top of the corporate world as he helps select Harvard’s next leader. And though much of Harvard’s future will rely on its ability to rebound from years of subpar endowment returns, Chenault’s friends and colleagues said he will take a “holistic” approach to the search and look beyond financial concerns.
“When you deal with Ken Chenault there are no stray pieces,” said former U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, who knows Chenault from her time on the board of American Express. “He has a holistic view of business, a holistic view of philanthropy and education, and a very holistic view of talent.”
The son of a dentist and a dental hygienist, Chenault is a graduate of Bowdoin College and Harvard Law School. He is one of the newer faces on the Corporation, joining the governing body in 2014.
“I think he understands the breadth of Harvard’s impact in the world,” Merck CEO and long-time friend Kenneth C. Frazier said. “As a businessperson, I think he understands the importance for an institution like Harvard in terms of producing the next generation of business leaders.”
Aside from his commitment to Harvard, Chenault is chair of the National Museum of African American History and Culture’s Advisory Council and was a lead fundraiser for the 400,000-square-foot Smithsonian Institution museum, which opened its doors in September 2016. He also serves on the boards of IBM, Procter & Gamble, and several non-profits.
Chenault’s status as a leading executive has earned him attention in the political world. In 2011, when former Psresident Barack Obama was narrowing down his cabinet picks for Secretary of Commerce and Treasury, Chenault was a top contender. He was also a member of Obama’s Jobs Council and made frequent trips to Washington, attending state dinners and sitting down with Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke.
“I think he was what I would call a superstar CEO,” Hugh B. Price, former head of the National Urban League and a friend of Chenault’s, said. “He took charge of an iconic American corporation, and that’s a challenge that’s above and beyond the normal challenge facing a CEO.”
With his financial acumen and fundraising skill, Chenault may approach the search from a businessman’s perspective. Harvard Management Company has performed poorly in recent years, posting a negative 2 percent return in fiscal year 2016 and a 8.1 percent return in fiscal year 2017—a performance that N. P. Narvekar, the company’s CEO, called “disappointing.” Some donors and experts said the next president will need to possess the business savvy necessary to help right the ship.
Barshefsky said Chenault will also bring his “great instincts for spotting talent” to the search committee, a skill he has had to acquire after years of picking executives and structuring his company. He is also likely to take diversity into account as he helps the committee winnow down its list of names.
As one of four black Fortune 500 CEOs in the country, Price said Chenault has been a mentor and role model—a “sort of a godfather to the new generation of CEOs.” Frazier, for example, said Chenault has been an important mentor throughout his career.
If this search cycle’s timeline mirrors the recent ones, the Corporation will decide on the next Harvard president soon after Chenault leaves American Express and trades his New York City boardroom for a Cambridge hotel conference room.
“You couldn’t have a better member of the search committee,” Barshefsky said.
Jessica Tuchman Mathews ’67 has left quite the mark on American foreign policy. From the pages of the Washington Post, a seat on the National Security Council, and the helm of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, she has weighed in on topics ranging from non-governmental organizations to nuclear nonproliferation.
Now, at a time when Harvard is increasingly wading into politics, Mathews is taking her expertise to the Harvard presidential search.
Mathews is one of 12 members of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body. All 12—plus three members of the Board of Overseers—comprise the search committee, which has been hunting for a person to succeed University President Drew G. Faust since she announced she would step down in June.
Mathews path to foreign policy was not a conventional one, academically or career-wise. As a child growing up in New York, she was interested in horseback riding, according to her sister, Lucy T. Eisenberg ’61. Their mother, Barbara Tuchman ’33, was a historian and two-time Pulitzer Prize winner.
At Radcliffe College, Mathews studied biochemical sciences, and went on to receive a Ph.D. in molecular biology from the California Institute of Technology in 1973. It was not until 1977 that she took on her first major role in foreign policy, as the director of the Office of Global Issues at the National Security Council under then-President Jimmy Carter.
In the foreign policy world, Mathews is known for her forward-thinking approach. In a 1988 interview with Bill Moyers, she argued that climate change would become an international relations issue. And after her article on the influence of non-governmental organizations, “Power Shift,” was published in Foreign Affairs in 1997, the magazine named it one of the most influential articles in its 75-year history.
Friends and associates say Mathews stands out for her cross-disciplinary interests.
“She's unusual in that she has a strong knowledge in science as well as of foreign policy and politics, so she has a broad range,” Nicholas D. Kristof ’82, a former Crimson Editor and former Overseer, said.
“She’s so passionate about so many things,” Eisenberg said.
Mathews’s wide array of interests and expertise drew the attention of Harvard’s presidential search committee in 2006: Her name was on a list of 30 candidates that search committee presented to the Board of Overseers two months before Faust’s selection.
In an interview with the Washington Examiner about Carnegie in 2008, Mathews said she cared deeply about hiring researchers with hands-on, practical experience. It is a credo that may also inform her approach to the presidential search.
“They have to also be able to open the door and come out and get the results into people’s heads and hands, and to do that work is equally important,” she said.
Mathews has also made clear her views on the necessity of guiding Harvard into an increasingly globalized world.
In 2012, when Mathews was named as a fellow to the Corporation, she said in a statement to the Harvard Gazette—a publication run by Harvard Public Affairs and Communications—that she would bring her international experience to University governance.
“The world of education is globalizing, with consequences as profound as those for government and business. Having spent more than a decade building a global think tank, I look forward to helping think through this great University’s international role,” she said.
Tracy P. Palandjian ’93 is all about making an impact.
She is the CEO and co-founder of Social Finance Inc, a firm best known for pioneering the field of impact investing, which strives to benefit social causes.
Now, as one of the 15 people tasked with finding Harvard’s next president, she’ll be making an impact on the future of higher education.
At 46, she is the youngest member of the search committee and one of just three members of the Board of Overseers on it. Her friends and colleagues said that her international background and commitment to accessibility in education will shape her approach to the search.
Sir Ronald Cohen, a former Overseer who co-founded Social Finance with Palandjian in 2011, said that Palandjian is interested in sustained educational accessibility.
“She is interested in how early you can begin to improve people's educational or attainment level through impact investment and then carrying it on through the whole of primary school, high school, and tertiary education,” Cohen said.
Nicholas D. Kristof ’82, a former Crimson Editor and former Overseer, also said Palandjian cares about accessibility.
“I think she cares about making the university a public good and about helping students find purpose about the Business School, the College, and about basic education expertise,” Kristof said.
Palandjian grew up in Hong Kong, and, before Social Finance, she spent time at McKinsey & Company, Wellington Management, and the Parthenon Group.
Colleagues think Palandjian’s variety of experience will uniquely influence her decision-making in the search.
“She’s a Harvard person, she has a global perspective, she's worked in different sectors,” said Karen Dynan, a professor of economics who serves on the board of Social Finance. “She's worked in the private sector but she’s steeped in nonprofit activities, the nature of them means she’s doing a lot of work with government.”
Indeed, Palandjian’s relationship with Harvard runs especially deep. She graduated from the College with a degree in Economics in 1993, and an MBA from the Business School in 1997. She was elected to the Harvard Board of Overseers in 2012 and rose to become Vice President of the Board in May 2017.
Dynan said she expects Palandjian will consult a wide variety of sources to inform her selection.
“She wants to hear everyone's view, for example, from the undergraduates to the most senior administrators at Harvard. So it's kind of like she's doing her own large scale research project on what would make for a good president and who the strong candidates are,” Dynan said.
Because her methodology is so focused on information collection, colleagues say it is difficult to guess what type of candidate Palandjian might pick.
“I think Tracy's personal style is such that, when she takes a risk, she makes sure she is as informed as best as she can be about all the possible outcomes and what the implications to those outcomes would be,” Dynan said.
Regardless, associates expressed a deep confidence in Palandjian’s ability to guide Harvard into this process.
“She has a remarkable combination of intellect and good heart,” Cohen said.
On a search committee of rookies, Susan L. Graham ’64 stands out: Only she and William F. Lee '72 have been through the process of selecting a Harvard president.
A professor of electrical engineering and computer science at Berkeley, Graham was a member of the Board of Overseers trio that joined the Corporation during the search that resulted in now-University President Drew G. Faust’s selection.
“She had, I’m sure, a very powerful voice there,” prominent donor Paul A. Buttenwieser ’60 said. “She has a long and broad and deep experience with Harvard governance.” Buttenwieser was Graham’s “classmate” on the Board of Overseers—the two were elected to the same six-year term.
Long before she would join the Corporation or the Board of Overseers, Graham was an undergraduate at Radcliffe studying mathematics. She later moved across the country to teach in California, and became the first female faculty member in Berkeley’s College of Engineering.
Her commitment to Harvard over the decades led her to become president of the Board of Overseers in 2006. She played a major role in the formation of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, which had formerly been a division in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Buttenwieser said Graham can bring a “computer scientist’s view” to the search—a particularly important perspective as Harvard seeks to bolster its engineering programs. The next president will more than likely oversee SEAS’s long-delayed relocation to its new Allston campus in 2020.
“It’s wonderful to have her voice—obviously somebody from the field of computer science, which is an area we’re making a huge investment in both financially and institutionally,” Buttenwieser said.
Graham hasn’t publicly said what she’s looking for in candidates this time around. But she has said that the next president likely won’t be a “clone” of Faust.
“An institution always benefits from some amount of change,” Graham said in a September interview.
Reflecting on selecting Faust in 2006, Graham said in a September interview that there is never a “perfect candidate.”
“She was a very good candidate, and in my mind, a lot of that came from the Radcliffe Institute experience,” Graham said, referring to Faust’s handling of Radcliffe alumni tensions in light of the merger, and her handling of the Institute’s financial issues as its dean.
Graham praised Faust for encouraging collaboration “across boundaries,” since university academics have traditionally been siloed, she said.
“I would like to see that continued, because I think some of the most exciting research and teaching comes from crossing traditional boundaries,” Graham said.
A leading voice in the computer science world, Graham was a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery in the 1990s, and is also a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.

In the search for Harvard’s next president, Susan L. Carney ’73 will bring something indispensable to the 15-member search committee: time behind enemy lines.
For more than a decade, Carney, now a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, worked at Yale in the Office of General Counsel. There, she worked closely with top Yale administrators to address some of the most pressing legal challenges facing higher education—experience, her colleagues expect, will inform her approach to the search.
Carney began working at Yale’s legal office in 1998, soon transitioning to serve as the Deputy General Counsel in 2001. She made her way through the ranks to become Acting General Counsel at Yale from July to December 2008.
Her career at Yale involved cases covering “an extraordinary range of issues,” according to former Yale University President Richard C. Levin. Carney worked on cases dealing with ethics, business law, research regulation, and international agreements.
“From her professional vantage point, she came to understand intimately the workings of a large, complex and excellent research university,” Levin wrote in an email.
In May 2010, Former President Barack Obama appointed Carney to her current position as an appellate judge. Now, she has circled back to Harvard to serve on the committee that is looking for University President Drew G. Faust’s successor. Carney is one of three members of Harvard’s Board of Overseers, the University’s second-largest governing body on the 15-person committee. The other two are President of the Board of Overseers Scott A. Abell ’72 and vice chair of the executive committee Tracy P. Palandjian ’93.
According to Levin H. Campbell ’83, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, Carney’s extensive legal experience is central to what her contributions might be over the course of the search.
Prior to her career at Yale, Carney worked as Campbell’s clerk in Boston and as an Associate General Counsel to the Peace Corps in Washington. She was the president of the Harvard Law School Association of the District of Columbia in 1979.
But her experience at Yale, according to Campbell, gives Carney “some perspective as to what a president of Harvard might be dealing with too and what qualities she might decide are important for a president to have.”
Former Yale Corporation member Dorothy K. Robinson agreed. She wrote in an email that Carney “is an extraordinarily thoughtful person, a superb listener, and deeply knowledgeable about higher education, and I am certain that she brings these qualities to her work with the committee.”
“Few people have seen up close so many leaders of the global higher education community. She knows what it takes to be a successful leader,” Levin wrote.
Theodore V. Wells, Jr. is a force in the courtroom: His sharp analytical mind and practical judgement propelled him to prominence as one of the country’s top defense attorneys, friends and colleagues say.
Now, though, Wells will turn his discerning eye toward finding a president for Harvard who will satisfy the University’s many constituencies and promote diversity, according to those who know him.
A member of the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—since 2012, Wells is part of the 15-member committee leading the search for a replacement for University President Drew G. Faust, who will step down in June 2018.
Part of the first waves of black students to integrate both the Washington, D.C. public school system and the College of the Holy Cross, Wells is no stranger to adversity. He received a joint M.B.A./J.D. from Harvard Business School and Law School in 1976, and from there, rise through the ranks of corporate law.
Since then, he has been determined to ensure that young black people have access to the same opportunities—and ultimately, the heights of the legal world and academia. He co-chaired the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund, and has mentored many black students and younger faculty at the Law School.
“He’s been a pillar for multiple generations that have come through Harvard Law School,” said Kristin A. Turner, a former president of the Black Law Students Association and one of Wells’s mentees.
Wells is a firm believer that there is “no conflict between excellence and diversity,” according to Janet D. Bell, the wife of Wells’s former Law professor Derrick Bell.
It is this belief that informs Wells’s priorities on the Corporation, Law School friend and Merck CEO Kenneth C. Frazier said. Particularly at a time when a high-profile affirmative action lawsuit is challenging Harvard’s efforts to promote diversity, Frazier said Wells is likely to look for presidential contenders who share this view.
“I know that he cares about this concept that educational excellence and educational opportunity are complementary and consistent goals for a school like Harvard,” Frazier said. “I would suspect that he would be keenly listening to whether the prospective candidates also value those two things which often in our society are treated as though they are not consistent and complementary.”
Bell said Wells is “forward-moving” and will likely consider where Harvard will be in five or 10 years when culling candidates.
Still, friends say, Wells is a pragmatist, not a firebrand. When protests over racial issues flared up at the Law School in 2016, Wells counseled students to ensure that their activism did not imperil their academic performance.
Law Professor and Winthrop House Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan Jr., one of Wells’s mentees, said Wells is able to perceive and reconcile conflicting interests.
“He’s got a keen mind and is able to drill down to the nub of an issue quite quickly and recognize what values are in tension in any sort of problem he is asked to resolve,” Sullivan said.
Wells has frequently positioned himself as a conduit between students and administrators at the Law School, Frazier said—and in the presidential search, he will likely aim to strike a similar balancing act between the various priorities of different constituencies.
“That’s the value of having a person like Ted, because he’s lived on both sides of the tracks, so to speak,” Frazier said.

They call him “Mr. Harvard.” A corporate tycoon and major donor who fondly remembers his days playing center for the Harvard football team, Joseph J. O’Donnell ’67 is continuing a long history of giving back to his alma mater by serving on the committee that will select Harvard’s next president.
 Boasting connections in both business and government across Boston and the country, O’Donnell may focus on building Harvard’s campus in Allston and forging partnerships with the city of Boston.
Outside Harvard, O’Donnell is a prominent Boston businessman. He is the founder and former chairman of Boston Culinary Group, Inc., chairman of the board of Centerplate, Inc., and the owner of Allied Advertising Agency. He sits on the boards of several other organizations.
In college, O’Donnell was a star player on the football and baseball teams, earning six varsity letters and captaining the baseball squad as a senior.
Robert L. Flanagan ’67, one of O’Donnell’s classmates and football teammates, said O’Donnell thinks his Harvard education made possible his professional success.
“I think Joe really appreciated the opportunities that Harvard gave him,” he said. “He was a kid from a working class area and working class family and Harvard just gave him this wonderful opportunity that he really took advantage of.”
O’Donnell, whom Flanagan described as “loyal to the institution,” has donated extensively to Harvard. In 2012, he and his wife Katherine A. O’Donnell gave the University $30 million. He also endowed the baseball coach position in 1995, a position that is named after him.
Apart from Harvard, O’Donnell’s philanthropic efforts have centered on cystic fibrosis research. After O’Donnell’s 12-year-old son, Joey, died of the disease in 1986, O’Donnell and his wife founded the Joey Fund, a group dedicated to the discovery of a cure.
Throughout his involvement as an alumnus, O’Donnell has helped Harvard forge connections with the city of Boston.
“He knows everybody, and everybody loves him,” said Paul A. Buttenweiser ’60. “And he’s very well connected with virtually everybody in the city of Boston and Cambridge, in the state and nationwide.”
O’Donnell’s acquaintances include former U.S. President George W. Bush, who appointed him to the President’s Advisory Committee on the Arts in 2001.
Freshman dean Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said O’Donnell’s ability to create partnerships with Boston has helped the University.
“Joe has tremendous street smarts and I think he is able to make sure that the city of Boston and Harvard are fielding a partnership and looking after one another's interests,” he said. “I think he's been instrumental in that.”
According to Buttenweiser, one of O’Donnell’s notable traits is his charisma.
“I think he must know more people than anybody else I know. And more people say, ‘Oh yeah,  Joe O’Donnell’s my closest friend,’” he said. “I don’t know who he says is his closest friend, but about a thousand people think that he’s their closest friend.”
Dingman agreed, describing O’Donnell as “one in a million” and “one of the most charismatic people I’ve met in my life.”
According to Dingman, O’Donnell could be looking for a University president who will value “issues of inclusivity and community” and who will make expansion into Allston a priority.
“He recognizes the constraints of developing on this side of the river and will want to know that the institution can be responsive to new areas of academic pursuit,” Dingman said, adding that does not necessarily mean that O’Donnell is “pushing a STEM agenda.”
Describing O’Donnell’s involvement in the University, Buttenweiser said he has made valuable contributions in many different areas.
“He’s sort of Mr. Harvard,” Buttenweiser said “He is a very leading member of the community in many ways.”

As Harvard searches for its 29th president in the coming months, it will seek a leader who can manage a large research university and who boasts a celebrated academic background.
Given her own experience in government service, academia, and the private sector, Karen Gordon Mills ’75 is poised to seek a candidate who best marries the various responsibilities of the modern Harvard presidency, according to her friends and colleagues.
Mills joined the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body in 2014, after serving on the Board of Overseers between 1999 and 2005. Under Obama, she led the Small Business Administration from 2009 to 2013. After she left the Cabinet, she joined the teaching staff of Harvard Business School—where Nitin Nohria, who many consider a front runner in the search, is dean—as a Senior Fellow. Her connections to academia extend beyond Harvard; her husband, Barry Mills, was the president of Bowdoin College between 2001 and 2015.
Prior to her government service, she was involved in private equity, management consulting, and a number of corporate boards. She still sits as a director on a number of company boards, and is the president of MMP Group, a private equity firm based in Maine.
Lilli Gordon—Mills’s friend and the founder of First Aid Beauty, where Mills is a director and investor—said Mills’s expansive professional network will be a major asset to the search committee’s work.
“There’s probably nobody relevant to the search that she doesn’t know,” Gordon said.
Ramana Nanda, a professor at the Business School, said her network spans a variety of fields.
“She’s a person who just has a tremendous network that she can tap into in some sense having been in the private sector, in government, in academia,” Nanda said. “There’s relatively few academics who have spanned that range of constituencies or networks.”
Nanda also said Mills’s time in the business world rounds out her academic endeavors, adding  her academic research has expanded her practical knowledge from business experience.
“I think that it really helps to have spent time in the University as a business person because it provides this mix of perspectives,” Nanda said. “That’s the unique element that she brings to the table — having deeply lived in multiple constituencies as a practitioner but also had the opportunity to step back as an academic and think about these things in a dispassionate way.”
Gordon said Mills will be valuable to the search because she’s willing to ask the hard questions.
“She is probably the most insightful business person I have ever met,” Gordon said. “If there’s that one questions that’s sort of lurking in the back of people’s minds but just doesn’t quite make it forward, she’s going to be the one who asks it. She definitely informs any debate or discussion to an incredible degree.”
Lena G. Goldberg, a senior lecturer at the Business School, said Mills’s own background in business and leadership will likely determine what she looks for in potential candidates.
“If one were looking at a presidential search committee, clearly someone who understands the economy, the role of  business and small business in the economy would add tremendous value,” Goldberg said. “Professor Mills has also been a leader and understands what takes to be a leader.”
Gordon added that Mills isn’t one to have a narrow view of what makes a successful leader.
“Karen is smart enough and she is not dogmatic so I think she will be open to different models of leadership,” Gordon said.
