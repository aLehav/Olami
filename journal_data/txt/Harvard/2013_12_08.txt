After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 9, 2013, at 3:35 a.m.
 
Sietse K. Goffard ’15, who was defeated last month in his campaign to become vice president of the Undergraduate Council, was elected UC vice president in an internal UC election Sunday night that resolved several weeks of uncertainty about the incoming Council leadership.
Goffard, a representative from Currier House, defeated challenger and outgoing UC Secretary Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16 by a vote of 28-14, with Council members casting the secret ballots.
Goffard will serve alongside Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15, the UC vice president-elect who ascended to the UC presidency when his former running mate UC president-elect Samuel B. Clark ’15 resigned from the presidency immediately before his inauguration Sunday night.
Sunday night’s internal election came two and a half weeks after Clark and Mayopoulos, running as a joke ticket, won the UC election and immediately declared their intent to resign. Last week, however, Mayopoulos announced that he had changed his mind and would assume the UC presidency upon Clark’s resignation, leaving the UC vice president position vacant.
In a short speech to the Council after his inauguration, Mayopoulos explained to the gathered representatives why he changed his mind about stepping down.
“The UC has a problem: The student body does not understand the efficacy and purpose of the UC,” Mayopoulos said. “I want to fix this problem.”
After losing the vice presidential vote, Kanuparthy was nominated and elected as the new Council treasurer and Ivy Yard representative Stephen A. Turban ’17 was voted in as UC secretary.
Former UC presidential candidate C.C. Gong ’15 began the vice presidential election process by nominating her former running-mate, Goffard. When Goffard returned the nomination, Gong declined to be considered. Similarly, former UC presidential candidate Chika-Dike O. Nwokike ’15 also declined a nomination for the position.
Kanuparthy was the only candidate to receive a nomination who did not run in last month’s election. In an interview after the meeting, he said that he asked to be nominated in part to provide choices that would incite conversation about the role of the vice president position.
Although both candidates used their three-minute speeches to emphasize the time they had dedicated to the UC, they differentiated themselves during the question-and-answer session.
Goffard highlighted his efforts to facilitate student advocacy while Kanuparthy noted that his involvement in the UC Finance Committee would be particularly beneficial with the state of UC finances expected to remain a major issue in the next year.
In a discussion period during which both candidates left the room, outgoing UC Treasurer Jonathan Y. Li ’14 and outgoing UC Finance Committee Chair Matthew R. Marotta ’14 both agreed with Kanuparthy that it was important for the UC vice president to have a good understanding of the UC finances.
“Especially now, [with] the position that this Council is in in our finances, it is crucial that somebody has finance experience on this ticket,” Marotta said. “I think that the work that Meghamsh has done [on this issue] is extremely in-depth.”
UC Education Committee Chair Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 pushed back, pointing out that neither outgoing UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14 nor outgoing UC vice president Jen Q. Zhu ’14 had significant experience in the Council’s finances when they were elected. Rather, he argued, it is the role of the UC vice president to facilitate “big-picture advocacy” efforts.
Zhu said that the position is not strictly defined. “It’s up to you what you think the UC vice president role should be, whether it’s finance or advocacy,” Zhu said.
Raghuveer emphasized the importance of having a UC vice president who can support Mayopoulos, a UC outsider, in “every single capacity” as he navigates the UC presidency.
“Gus is in for a big learning curve,” Raghuveer said. “I’m saying that now because my learning curve was incredibly steep.”
The election of the vice president, secretary, and treasurer of the Council finalized the Council’s Executive Committee for 2014. In internal committee elections held throughout the last week, Goyal was re-elected as Education Committee chair, Leah C. Singer ’16 was elected as Finance Committee chair, Gong was elected as student initiatives chair, Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 was elected as student relations chair, and Oliver W. Kim ’16, a Crimson editorial writer, was elected student life committee chair. The Rules Committee does not hold elections, as the chair position is appointed by the UC president.
Later in the three-hour long meeting, the Council allocated funds to student organizations through its last grants package of the semester and passed legislation renewing the UC’s commitment to fund DAPA.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Through 40 minutes, senior goalkeeper Raphael Girard looked unbeatable against the defending national champions. In the last 25, he was caught looking twice, but the night still belonged to the Quebecois.
Girard posted a career-high 52 saves as the Crimson dropped a two-goal lead in the third period to tie No. 8 Yale, 2-2, in New Haven on Saturday night.
In the 240th meeting between the two rivals, second period goals from freshmen forwards Alex Kerfoot and Luke Esposito gave the Crimson (4-7-2, 2-6-2 ECAC) an early lead. But the Bulldogs (6-3-3, 3-2-3) responded in the final frame of regulation with strikes from junior defenseman Matt Killain and senior forward Kenny Agostino.
After two periods, Girard had already seen a game’s worth of shots, turning away Yale’s first 31 attempts on goal. The senior can now boast a conference-best .948 save percentage.
“[Girard] stood on his head, and he’s been doing that since day one,” Kerfoot said. “Every time he’s back there, you feel like you have a chance to win. He’s incredibly athletic, and that gives you a lot of confidence playing in front of him.”
This week Girard started in back-to-back games for the first time this year. The senior from Saint-Hyacinthe, Que., had 33 stops in the Crimson’s 2-1 loss against Dartmouth on Friday.
On Saturday, three of Girard’s saves came in overtime. In the extra frame, Harvard enjoyed the better of the opportunities but ultimately left a point in the standings on the table.
“As much as we’re not satisfied with the tie, it was a good effort, and I thought we competed,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said.
In the first period, Girard showed that he would be tough to beat. The senior was peppered with shots in the final minutes of the opening frame as the home team closed out the period on a power play.
The Crimson got on the board first on the power play. A screening Kerfoot put away his third goal of the season after corralling a deflected shot from sophomore line-mate Jimmy Vesey.
The visitors punctuated the middle frame with key plays on both sides of the ice. Girard provided a kick-save on a shot high in the slot from Gus Young with 30 seconds left in the frame. Off the next faceoff, a slap shot from junior defenseman Patrick McNally bounced off the right pad of Lyon and onto the stick of Esposito, who buried his third goal of the year 13 seconds before the intermission.
Girard finally made a mistake early in the third period. After a stuff-attempt from freshman Yale forward Matt Killain, the senior failed to locate the puck under his pads before Killain poked it between the pipes to draw the home team within one.
The score gave Yale new life as the Bulldogs registered a period-high 20 shots in the final frame. Yet Harvard continued to force most of the Bulldogs’ opportunities to the outside. Junior defender Max Everson broke up a Yale 2-on-1 with ten minutes left in regulation.
With six minutes to play in regulation, Yale’s persistence paid off with a strike from its leading scorer. Agostino faked a cross-ice pass before beating Girard five-hole with a wrist shot from the right-wing faceoff circle to knot the score at two.
With less than four minutes left in regulation, a cross-checking minor to Yale defenseman Rob O’Gara gave the Crimson a power play. The visitors had broken their dry spell on their first man-up chance of the game, but the Crimson could only muster a shot on goal with the score knotted at two.
In overtime, the Crimson’s best chance came with 40 seconds left in the game, after a rebound off a shot from the point man Everson bounced onto the skate of center Sean Malone, who had open net on the right wing. But the freshman could not transfer the puck to his stick before Lyon could regroup.
For Donato, the final score was disappointing but a step in the right direction.
“We’re a little disappointed with the lead going into the third and not being able to secure a victory, but once they scored to tie the game, I thought we really responded well and had some good chances,” Donato said. “I thought we carried the play in overtime.”
Harvard now sits tenth in the ECAC as it heads into a three-week break on a three-game winless streak. The Crimson will next face Yale on Jan. 11 in the Rivalry On Ice game, a nationally-televised non-conference match-up at Madison Square Garden.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undefeated in the Ivy League for the start of its 2013-2014 campaign, the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team (3-0, 3-0 Ivy) took a break from Ancient Eight competition to test itself against stiffer squads. With the swimmers flying halfway across the country for the Texas Invitational, the divers remained in Cambridge for the MIT Invitational.
“We went down [to the University of Texas at Austin] with the intention…of seeing and [evaluating] the work that we’ve been doing and getting fast in the end against some of the best teams in the country,” co-captain Chris Satterthwaite said. “And we did exactly just that.”
Squaring off against some of the top ranked teams in Division I such as host and first-ranked Texas, fourth-ranked USC, and 10th-ranked Arizona, the 18th ranked Crimson held its own in the pool at Austin.
TEXAS INVITATIONAL
Though the overall strength of the field led to Harvard swimmers finishing in a lower position than they would have against Ivy opponents, the Crimson athletes still saw many of their season times drop in Austin.
“This [was] a chance to race some guys who we probably don’t have a chance of beating, but it gives us the opportunity to rise above [our personal limits],” Satterthwaite said. “It gives us a little more experience and training going into a meet like the Ivy Championships, where the competition level is very high.”
On day one of the invite, Satterthwaite and fellow co-captain Oliver Lee teamed up with familiar faces in junior Griffin Schumacher and senior Danny Crigler to come in third in the 200 freestyle relay.  Their NCAA provisional B time of 1:18.30 was just .24 seconds off their school record time and .73 seconds behind the winning Texas relay group.
Two evenings later, the quartet reunited for another third place finish, this time in the 400 free relay. The group’s 2:53.69 clip was good enough for another NCAA provisional B qualification.
“We’re going close to best times in the middle of the season, which is great,” Lee said. “It’s nice to see that we’re taking steps towards our best times, and some of us got our best times and others were close…. It means that we’re going to have great drops at the end of the season.”
Aside from swimming in the same lane for each relay, Satterthwaite and Lee found themselves getting set on different blocks for the 100 free.
“Aside from being captains, we’re really good friends, but also very competitive,” Lee said. “We swim [the same events] very differently, so he definitely pushes me at the back ends of the races, and I push him at the front ends. It helps us both reach higher levels we wouldn’t otherwise be able to reach.”
Satterthwaite came out on top in the B heat final for 11th place with a 43.66 time, while Lee finished two spots behind at 44.08.
In his first collegiate invite, freshman Jack Manchester touched the wall eighth in the A heat of the 200 backstroke. His 1:44.42 time was both the same as his prelim time and good enough for a NCAA provisional B qualifying time.
Sophomore Jacob Luna continued his solid season with a time of 1:45.04 in the 200 butterfly and the highest individual finish for a Harvard swimmer for the invite.
“For Jack, this was a validation of the work he’s been doing in the water and the potential he has for the years to come, along with the other freshmen,” Satterthwaite said. “Jacob’s put in an incredible amount of work over the summer and in this year training-wise, and his race is a demonstration [of that] and the success he’ll have for the future.
MIT INVITATIONAL
Back home, after the Harvard women took both diving events, senior diver Joe Zarella followed suit, claiming both of the men’s diving events at MIT.
The Staten Island native defeated Tufts diver Jonah Schmidt in the three meter by six points with a final score of 383.20, while junior George Doran finished third with 356.40. Zarella continued his diving dominance with a 25-point margin of victory over his nearest opponent in the one-meter.
After coming in fifth at the 2011 Texas Invitational in the one-meter, Doran finished fourth in Austin this season, a little more than 54 points behind Zarella’s winning score of 349.40.
Rounding out an impressive showing by the Harvard diving program, freshman Manasseh Oso finished third in the one-meter and ninth in the three-meter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s swimming and diving team (2-1, 2-1 Ivy) had impressive showings at separate invites this past week, with the swimmers traveling to the Texas Invitational, and a small contingent of swimmers and divers going across town and finishing second at the MIT Invitational.
Faced with a nationally ranked field at the University of Texas, the swimmers posted solid personal times all around but were further down the leaderboard than in Ivy meets.
“We really stepped up against [the strong field],” said freshman distance swimmer Ashlee Korsberg. “We tried to race well against [the solid teams], and it was exciting to go up against them.”
Led by sophomore Danielle Lee’s ninth place finishes in the 100 and 200 backstroke events and strong relay results, Harvard demonstrated it could compete on a bigger stage.
TEXAS INVITATIONAL
Although the invitational in the Lone Star state may have been a break from Ivy League play, it did not signal a respite from stiff competition.
Taking a break from its dual meet action, the 22nd ranked Crimson squad squared off against teams such as first ranked USC, host and ninth ranked Texas, and a 14th ranked UCLA group.
“We thought we did well [in Texas],” Korsberg said. “It was exciting to race against other schools than the ones that are in our conference, and we thought we raced really well against them.”
If the Harvard women had any butterflies in their stomachs while taking their mark next to some of the best collegiate swimmers in the country, they didn’t show it.
In the first event of the invite, the 200 free relay B team of freshmen Daniela Johnson and Summer Schmitt, Lee, and junior Faith Martin turned in a 13th place finish. Their time of 1:35.62 was a fraction of a tick faster than the grouping’s morning preliminary time.
Building the foundation for her impressive three-day showing, Lee also swam her portion of the 400 medley relay at a 54.19 clip, keying her quartet to the eighth spot in the final. Coming in 11th in the same event at 3:49.91 was the B relay quartet of freshmen Marissa Cominelli and Korsberg, Johnson, and captain Danielle Schulkin.
In the best women’s performance of the invite by a Harvard swimmer, Lee came from behind to win the B heat of the 100 backstroke. A hair behind Brigham Young University’s Hailey Campbell going into the final turn, Lee kicked into an extra gear, stretching to finish .04 seconds ahead of Campbell. Her personal best time of 53.87 earned her an NCAA provisional B time and came just .28 seconds behind the Harvard record time for the event.
“She works hard at practice and had great wall [turns in the 100-yard backstroke],” Korsberg said. “Her underwater dolphin kicks are really good, and she was able to get ahead in her races with [those].”
Lee continued to steal the show on the final day of the invite with another B heat victory, this time in the 200 backstroke with a time of 1:57.36, just a bit more than two seconds off the Crimson’s record pace.
On the distance side, Korsberg continued to shine in her first season with a 13th place finish in the 500 freestyle B heat and also came in 10th in the longest collegiate event, the 1650-yard freestyle.
MIT INVITATIONAL
A little closer to home, a group of Harvard swimmers and divers earned second place at the MIT Invitational with 676.5 points. Though the number was a far cry from the Engineer’s winning total of 1208.5, it was impressive, given that the Crimson was only fielding about half of its team.
To start things off, the trio of senior Paige Newell and sophomores Connie Hsu and Daniela Suarez-Rebling outpaced the seven-school field in the 500 free event for the first of three Crimson podium sweeps of the invitational.
And in an impressive display of the Crimson’s depth in the one-meter and three-meter diving events, Harvard took the top five positions of both, with underclassmen leading the way.
Freshman Brittany Wang took first in the 1-meter with a 301.35 score, less than four points ahead of teammate Elina Leiviska, who returned the favor by beating her fellow freshman by a 35 point margin in the 3-meter event with a score of 343.15. The Crimson divers finished with a 176-point total in just two events.
“It was awesome and really great for us [to sweep both events] and to see the team be together,“ Leiviska said. “We all did well so we can all be proud of our teammates.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Within the first two minutes of the women’s home hockey game Friday night, sophomore forward Miye D’Oench sent the first of five Harvard goals piercing into the back of New Hampshire’s net, opening the floodgates to the Crimson’s 5-0 victory.
When the Wildcats erred in their defensive end 1:48 into the game, senior Elizabeth Parker deftly passed the puck to D’Oench, who skated free for a breakaway after receiving the pass. Selfless team play resulting in the easy goal foreshadowed the offensive explosion Harvard put on for the Bright-Landry Hockey Center crowd.
“Anytime we can put up five goals on the scoreboard it’s a good thing, and Miye getting that first goal was great,” Crimson coach Maura Crowell said. “We got a lot of momentum off of that. Overall I was really happy with the team’s effort.”
Facing the Wildcats (6-10-2, 2-3-2 WHEA), Harvard (9-1-2, 7-1-1 ECAC) sought revenge on a team that they had tied last season. The victory resulted in the skaters’ second consecutive and sixth overall shutout of the season. The early goal set the tone for the remaining 58 minutes, which saw aggressive play from both teams throughout. 
“Any time you get up early it’s helpful,” D’Oench said. “Everyone can play with confidence, and I think that after that we were just relentless the whole game.” 
The second goal was a three-pronged effort, resulting in a score from freshman Sydney Daniels, her fifth of the season, off of freshman Abigail Frazer, who received the puck from junior Hillary Crowe, who later scored two goals Friday night. 
With conversions from four different skaters, Harvard took advantage of the Wildcats’ errors during the remainder of the contest, with two goals in the second period and one in the third. 
“Getting the shutout was huge, and just having scoring from all over has made us successful this season,” D’Oench said. “We’d like to see that continue. It’s really fun to be playing Hockey East teams, and especially to be beating Hockey East teams.”
The Crimson is currently tied for the longest unbeaten streak in the nation, nine games so far, due to strong resistance in the back from the defense and efficient conversions up top. 
Despite New Hampshire outshooting Harvard 29-25, the Crimson capitalized on its scoring opportunities. Harvard has only outshot opponents twice this season, with its sole loss coming in one of those two games, and currently sits in first place in the ECAC. 
“I don’t know if we take quality shots, versus peppering the goalie with shots, but I’ll take it,” Crowell said. “Stats are fun, but we don’t get bogged down in them. “
Freshman Brianna Laing maintained her second shutout of the season, blocking a total of 50 shots in her two performances on the ice thus far.
“We’ve got such great goalies, both [sophomore Emerance Maschmeyer and Laing], that no matter what, we’re going to play with confidence because we know they’ve got our backs,” D’Oench said. “If anything goes wrong, they’re there for us. Both Emerance and Bri just have battled and worked so hard at practice that I have, and the team has, great trust in both of them.”
The aggression of the third period led to double-digit shots on goal by New Hampshire and eight combined penalties between the two squads, but Laing and the defense never let up.
“I think in her first performance [against Colgate, Laing] showed that she’s better than a backup goalie so we felt like this was a good opportunity for her to get a start, and it worked out pretty well,” Crowell said. “She’s young, she’s played two games, she hasn’t given up a goal. I think she played a good 60 minutes. We definitely had some scares at the end, but she stayed focused and composed and got it done.”
 Although the Crimson took eight penalties of its own, the team killed off every one.
 “Obviously we want to stay out of the box, but there is something to be said about playing tough and standing up for your teammates,” junior captain Marissa Gedman said. “If we’re winning games, I don’t think it’s that big of a concern.” 
After playing two big games this weekend to end 2013, Harvard hopes to continue its success in the remainder of the season.
“We’re excited to be out here playing Hockey East teams,” Gedman said. “We’ve been preparing all year for them so we came out fine and I’m excited about it.”

Good things come to those who wait (kind of).
 
After years of being known as the faces of dejection from "The Social Network," Cameron S. H. Winklevoss '04 and Tyler O. H. Winklevoss '04 have, over the last eight months, become the faces of Bitcoin. Last April, the New York Times revealed that the twins have created one of the largest portfolios of the completely digital currency out there.

 
For those of you who are not as invested in the lives of the Winklevi, here's a bit of background. Bitcoin originated in 2009 as a peer-to-peer currency that operates independently of government regulation. Because they are heavily encrypted and accessible only using private keys, bitcoins are one of the most anonymous methods available for conducting transactions.
 
Forbes reported last month that since the Winklevosses’ investment was revealed, “the price of the digital currency has tripled.” And everyone is getting on board, even though no one is quite sure who created or controls Bitcoin (if anyone). According to the New York Times, commercial spaceflight company Virgin Galactic now accepts bitcoins for transactions, and Baidu, China’s most popular search engine, has endorsed the currency. Lawmakers in Washington are even holding hearings on them: Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke wrote in a letter to senators that the currency may hold “long-term promise.”
 Our favorite “aggressively aristocratic” duo is sure that bitcoins are not going away anytime soon. According to Forbes, Cameron Winklevoss believes that Bitcoin’s market cap could grow from $4 billion to $400 billion, though others are not so sure. (Compare that to Facebook’s current market cap of under $117 billion, and you see that the Winklevi are definitely setting up some kind of “last laugh” scenario here.)
The past week has not been so kind to the Bitcoin market, however. On Thursday, China took steps to restrict the use of Bitcoin as currency among its banks, and the market has since witnessed a marked decline in value. Only time will tell how the Winklevi fare in this venture, but if the past is any indication, we're willing to bet our bottom Bitcoin that the Winklevi will find a way to become the faces of one thing or another... eventually.

Next month, Harvard will once again have its very own winter wonderland where you can fit in some figure-eights between your noon and 2 p.m. classes. Here’s everything you need to know about the Science Center Plaza ice skating rink:
 
Dates: Originally, the rink was scheduled to open on December 2 and close before finals, but weather delayed construction. The rink’s opening is now set for January 24 and it will remain open until around until mid-March, provided the weather stays cold enough.
 
Hours: Open seven days a week from noon to 9 p.m. (Weather permitting.)
 
Cost: The rink, jointly sponsored by Harvard Common Spaces, Campus Services, and Harvard Student Agencies, is completely free. Skate rentals, on the other hand, will cost you: HSA is charging $5 per rental.
 
Shoe sizes: HSA will offer skate sizes ranging from child to adult. If your feet do not fit, contact a physician or bring your own skates.
Who can use it? The rink is open to the public (not just students), so expect to see everyone—from your CS50 TF to the woman who helped you at CVS—zooming around in circles this winter. Luckily for older siblings, children 14 and under must be accompanied by an adult.
 
Legal restrictions? Anyone who wishes to skate must first sign a waiver of liability, which about 0% of students will actually end up reading. You might want to look at the fine print to make sure you’re not accidentally purchasing a timeshare in Hawaii or taking out an adjustable rate mortgage.
 
Lessons: Free skating classes will be available for free to anyone over the age of 14.
 
How many people at a time? HSA and Harvard Open Spaces have not officially released a limit yet, so we’ll just assume the number is infinite until someone yells at us.
