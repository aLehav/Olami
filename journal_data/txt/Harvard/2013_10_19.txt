After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Entering the weekend tied with Brown for second place in the Ivy League, the Harvard women’s volleyball team travelled to Philadelphia on Friday night to take on Penn in a pivotal conference matchup.
After an opening game that saw the teams battle to a 28-26 Crimson victory, Harvard (9-6, 4-2 Ivy) defeated Penn (8-9, 2-4), three games to one.
Stepping up for the Crimson once again were freshman setter Corrine Bain and freshman outside hitter Grace Weghorst. Weghorst led the Crimson with 15 kills on the night, while Bain added 10. Bain also had 22 assists and added four service aces in the win. Sophomore Katherine Wallace and junior Caroline Waters also contributed nine kills each throughout the contest. On the defensive side, senior defensive specialist Natalie Doyle led the team with 12 digs.
Although the Quakers played solid defensively, with 74 digs to the Crimson’s 68, Penn could not maintain a consistent attack and ended the night with 32 attack errors and a .103 attack percentage. Key contributors in the game for the Quakers were senior outside hitter Kristin Etterbeek, who had 10 kills, and sophomore setter Alex Caldwell, who racked up 22 assists. Etterbeek also led the team in digs with 17.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although the Harvard football team was on the road for the past two weeks, it did not take the team long to readjust to life at home.
Facing Lafayette in Cambridge, the Crimson drove the ball down the field on its first possession of the game and seemed ready to settle for a field goal after a failed third-and-goal try.
But senior quarterback Michael Pruneau took the snap as the holder, jumped to his feet, and found a wide-open senior tight end Cam Brate in the end zone for the game’s first touchdown.
The Harvard offense continued tallying points throughout the contest, and the defense ensured the Leopards would never get going as the Crimson cruised to a 35-16 victory.
“It all started with defense today,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Anytime your [starting] defense doesn’t give up a touchdown to an FCS team, you’re doing a great job…. I was really happy with how hard our kids played and very happy with how we finished.”
Turnovers killed Lafayette all day long, and the Crimson succeeded in taking advantage of a number of Leopards’ miscues.
Early in the fourth quarter with Harvard leading 21-3, sophomore linebacker Eric Medes fell on a fumble forced by senior defensive back Brian Owusu.
The Crimson found the game’s knockout blow soon after. Pruneau found senior receiver Ricky Zorn on a post route for a 38-yard gain to bring the ball to midfield. And on the very next play, Pruneau dumped a pass over the middle to sophomore receiver Andrew Fischer, who sprinted through the Lafayette defense for a 50-yard touchdown.
The resounding three-play, 81-yard drive stretched Harvard’s lead to 25 points and effectively put the game away.
The Crimson took advantage of another Lafayette turnover early in the second quarter. Looking to put his team on the board, Leopards quarterback Andrew Dzurik was intercepted over the middle on a short third down in Harvard territory as sophomore linebacker Matt Koran’s tight coverage deflected the ball into the hands of junior Connor Sheehan.
A few plays later, after Harvard benefited from a pass interference penalty, sophomore running back Paul Stanton drove the ball through the Leopards’ defensive line for a three-yard touchdown to make the score 14-0.
“Turnovers are tough to overcome, and the other side of the ball has to respond to it,” Lafayette coach Frank Tavani said. “And that’s where we didn’t respond…. The response you need is points on the board, and obviously we fell short.”
With starting quarterback Conner Hempel still out with a knee injury, Pruneau filled in to make his second start of the season. The senior went 17-of-29 for 263 yards in the air and three touchdowns, two of which went to Brate.
But in the end, the day belonged to Stanton as much of Harvard’s offensive success came on the ground. The sophomore ended a career day with 113 rushing yards and two touchdowns.
Stanton’s second score of the game came after the Crimson defense forced a turnover-on-downs midway through the third quarter. A completion and short scramble by Pruneau moved the ball into Lafayette territory, and Stanton did the rest on back-to-back  carries for a combined 19 yards to cap the Harvard scoring drive with a touchdown.
The able Crimson rushing attack was supplemented by a defensive effort that seemed to overwhelm the young Leopards’ offense all game long.
As Lafayette looked to mount a two-minute drill and trim the Harvard lead at the end of the first half, Dzurik lofted a high pass down the right sideline around midfield. But Harvard defensive back Chris Splinter tracked the ball the entire way and made a leaping interception, his first of the season.
Even though freshman quarterback Drew Reed replaced Dzurik at the beginning of the second half, it was the same story all over again for Lafayette. On his first possession behind center, the freshman’s high throw was picked off by senior cornerback DJ Monroe on the right sideline.
The Leopards failed to score a touchdown in the first three quarters of play, and the team’s only points before the fourth quarter came on a second-quarter field goal. Harvard held Lafayette tailback Ross Scheuerman, who scored three touchdowns last week against Princeton, to only 68 yards on 21 carries.
The one sour note for the Harvard defense was the loss of junior linebacker Connor Sheehan, who suffered a fractured left elbow early in the second half and will likely be out for the rest of the season.
Reed threw for two touchdowns in the fourth quarter, but by that point the outcome of the game had been long decided.
“The morale of the team is very high right now,” captain Joshua Boyd said. “Obviously it’s one game at a time and we don’t look too far ahead, but we had some fun today because we put in a lot of work this week.”

Now that midterm season is almost over, you might need something to do before midterm season begins again in two weeks. The solution: Make this upcoming Halloween special by taking the time to create a Harvard-themed costume. Flyby came up with a few ideas to get you started.
TouristOption 1: Begin with regular clothing, then layer on a visor, sunglasses, and camera on a strap around your neck. Carry around the collection of plastic Coop bags you still have from freshman year when your mom bought you a Harvard sweatshirt. Speak all day in your favorite foreign accent, or just pretend to be a Canadian if you’re lazy.
Option 2: Dress up as a prospective applicant by donning a prep school uniform, asking overly-thoughtful questions, and scribbling notes furiously in preparation for the inevitable “Why Harvard?” question in your interview.
Option 3: Make it a group costume by coordinating with friends and assigning a tour guide with an umbrella, straw hat, or frilly dress with a hoop skirt (or all three at the same time). 
Elle WoodsFor those of you looking for a less, shall we say, substantive costume, this is a great option. Simply acquire a flaxen wig and don the Playboy Bunny outfit worn by fictitious Harvard Law School student Elle Woods in the 2001 hit “Legally Blonde.” Make it a duo costume by getting a girlfriend to dress as Elle’s rival Vivian Kensington in a chunky turtleneck, tweed skirt, and clogs.
Some inspiration: To quote Elle, “Oh, I like your outfit too [Vivian], except when I dress up as a frigid bitch, I try not to look so constipated.”
HUPD OfficerAs kids, many of us thought it was cool to go trick-or-treating and in a black uniform with a badge and plastic water gun to help us catch bad guys. Now that we’re at Harvard, we know it’s even cooler to stop the tourists from infiltrating Annenberg, catch deviants pedaling their bicycles through the Yard, and save shivering freshmen who got locked out of their rooms in a bathrobe. Ask nicely to borrow a uniform and rep HUPD with pride.
LamonsterIn this costume, you can scare little children as the horrifying transformation of an innocent bookworm into a scaled, coffee-breathing, Lamont-dwelling beast.
First, prepare ahead of time by not showering for several days. Put on a base layer of a Harvard t-shirt and sweatpants, and keep it classy with some flip flops. Next, find a roommate (if he's not already repulsed by your odor) to help apply those neon-colored sticky page marker tabs all over your body—these are the scales acquired by hours of reading.
Color your face green with highlighters, and then make horns by repurposing Lamont Café cups. A simple tail can be made by hole-punching and stringing together whatever you find in the bottom of your backpack: a broken mini-stapler, old sushi containers, the first draft of your Expos paper, etc. Complete the look with reddened eyes and stubble, and you are ready to go out on the prowl.
Ghost of John HarvardIf all else fails, cut two holes in a bedsheet, spray paint one of your shoes gold, and you’re set.

It’s one o’clock in the afternoon. You had a long morning full of classes, but that’s over now. Congratulations, you made it to lunch, the best part of your day. Up the stairs and through the doors, swipe that HUID and you’re in the d-hall. You see some friends saving a spot at a table so you throw your backpack down, pick up your cutlery, and proceed to the buffet. The only obstacles in between you and a perfect lunch are a few of Harvard’s most pressing first-world problems.As you approach the salad bar, you’ll find Exhibit A: tomatoes cut in quarters and circle-sliced cucumbers. The size is simply outrageous. How many times have you been caught mid-conversation, trying to fit the quarter tomato or awkwardly large slice of cucumber into your mouth? Sexual jokes aside, the cucumber and tomato slices are just too big. Honestly, who wants a quarter of a tomato for their salad? Serving tomatoes cut into smaller slices would create fewer awkward silences and a smoother salad-eating experience.
That salad line sure was a jungle but now you’ve hit all the food stations and you’re almost in the clear. You just have to deal with obstacle number two: the slow filtered-water dispenser. Everyone in front of you is filling up their DAPA water bottles and using the chilled filtered tab, easily the slowest stream. Seriously, the flow is weaker than Mac Miller’s latest album. All you want is a plastic cup half-filled with ice and seltzer, definitely the fastest combo. Is it better to be slightly dehydrated or wait 20 minutes? Either way you’re guaranteed to leave frustrated.
All these annoyances seem to fade away as you approach the froyo machine. But there’s one thing missing: toppings. Aside from Sunday Sundaes, there are rarely sprinkles or oreo crumbles or chocolate syrup. Nothing says “blah my day sucks” more than a bowl of plain vanilla froyo in an off-white bowl. Pro-tip! The whipped cream is in the fridge! You could potentially go four years without discovering this secret, but luckily we at Flyby are committed to journalistic excellence and aim to relentlessly expose such corruption.
Armed with this knowledge, we hope that you can enter the dining hall fully prepared to deal with these inconveniences. These aren’t the biggest problems in the world, and they’re not stopping us from living life to the fullest. However, they can be easily solved for the betterment of humanity. We'd never overestimate the weight of our words, but we would be surprised if there isn’t a new status quo by the time the next government shutdown rolls around.
