After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s campus is teeming with picturesque courtyards and foliage, brick streets lined by lush shades of green that transform into different colors throughout the year. Perhaps the most famous greenspace on campus is the Yard. Originally a cow pasture, Harvard Yard was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The greenspaces at Harvard are beautiful, making you wish you could save the memory for later.
Sustainability has had a varied history at Harvard, though the last two decades have seen substantial progress. Most notably, the Harvard Green Campus Initiative was launched in 2000 by faculty and staff, ushering in a new era of prioritizing sustainability. In 2004, Harvard adopted six sustainability principles to guide future green development on campus, and in 2008, then-University President Drew G. Faust established the Greenhouse Gas Task Force to examine greenhouse gas emissions at Harvard. This task force proposed a short-term goal that Harvard would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent below its 2006 baseline levels by 2016. Though Harvard achieved this goal, the University still fell short in other measures.
With the climate crisis an ever-looming threat, Harvard very recently announced its decision to fully divest from fossil fuels. Though Harvard divesting is a great announcement, it is one that came only after a decade of calls to do so from students, activists, faculty, and alumni; University President Lawrence S. Bacow publicly opposed fossil fuel divestment as recently as two years ago. Despite Harvard’s announcement on divestment, the timeline is still unclear, and organizations like Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard still intend to hold the University accountable for further action to mitigate climate change. As Jade O. Woods ’22, who is involved with Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard, said in an interview, “There’s still so much that Harvard needs to do, and that’s part of what the new purpose of our campaign is going to be doing, because we’re staying and continuing the fight to hold Harvard’s feet to the fire and see this commitment through.”
It’s an interesting juxtaposition that Harvard maintained investments in fossil fuels until recently — investing in an industry that has significantly contributed to climate change — while also maintaining beautiful courtyards filled with flora. The picturesque greenspace of Harvard Yard is in stark contrast to a polluted atmosphere and a scorched Earth. So what is this disconnect? Why was it so difficult for Harvard to cut ties with fossil fuel investments while so easily participating in actively recycling, composting, and being energy efficient on campus, among countless other sustainable initiatives?
Talking about climate change is an exercise in avoiding abstraction. With climate change now affecting everything from weather patterns to crop yields, describing climate change as something still “yet to come” distracts from the current urgency of what’s happening, likening our conversations about the changing climate to “not in my backyard”-esque frameworks. Surely, climate change won’t impact us, right? Talking about climate change as something that happens elsewhere makes it difficult to see the urgency in the issue, subverting the urgent problem instead into one more devoid of personal meaning.
Though Harvard has a multitude of outdoor courtyards, these spaces can be described as a more filtered view of nature, ones that are constantly pruned and maintained. Providing students with more opportunities to get out into more naturally occurring environments rather than man-made ones would allow students to develop a deeper connection with the environment as a whole. This connection can bring deeper meaning and more relevance to everyday actions of sustainability, because “it becomes very abstract when you’re just like ‘Oh, I’m composting because I’m supposed to’” as Cole Petersen ’23, the Office of Sustainability’s representative for Quincy House through the Resource Efficiency Program, described in an interview.
Being outdoors and actually seeing nature gives people a better sense of what will be lost if the adverse effects of climate change are not curbed quickly enough. As Petersen explained, “Personal connection to your space and to your greenspace is incredibly important for motivating sustainability because it kind of reminds you of what the goal is.”
Harvard should sponsor more initiatives to both expand the greenspaces on campus, as well as fund opportunities for more students to go and explore nature, in addition to continuing to take action to fully divest from fossil fuels. Groups like the Harvard Outing Club and programs like the First-Year Outdoor Program do a good job in exposing students to the great outdoors beyond Cambridge, but more institutionalized and broad initiatives aimed at teaching all Harvard affiliates to become better stewards of the environment would be extremely beneficial, and would allow discussions about climate change to transform from abstract to urgent.
Though Harvard Yard probably won’t be able to revert back to a cow pasture, the University can still be a more positive agent of change when it comes to protecting the environment by expanding access to nature, as well as follow through with its promise to divest from fossil fuels.
Picturing Harvard Yard as a wasteland is jarring — but not a reality too far off if we do not begin treating climate change with the urgency it necessitates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A key sticking point in negotiations between Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers and Harvard administrators has been the union’s demand for what it calls “real recourse” — a third-party grievance procedure through which allegations of discrimination, harassment, and intimidation can be arbitrated impartially. While the union recently conceded their demand for an entirely third-party arbitration process, this concession is far from a vindication of Harvard’s current, internally-controlled procedures. HGSU-UAW is still demanding significant involvement of third-party individuals and assistance with legal support for students within the University’s Title IX process.
But student workers are not the only critics of Harvard’s existing internal system for investigating such allegations. As faculty, we agree that Harvard’s existing Title IX mechanisms and resources for addressing sex- and gender-based misconduct do not ensure the safety and well-being of its members. Rather, they pose serious problems for governance and redress.
Title IX stipulates that all Harvard employees are mandatory reporters who must refer sex- and gender-based misconduct allegations to a Title IX coordinator. The mandate removes discretionary power from departments and individual faculty, and concentrates authority to mediate and investigate misconduct at higher levels of the University. As such, Title IX introduces a fundamental conflict between being accountable to an institutional level above the department and the departmental commitment to cultivating forms of mutuality and accountability that are key to forging a moral community.
The process of managing complaints amplifies this conflict. Title IX is not a confidential resource. Its officers share information on a “need to know” basis but because very few, if any, faculty are made aware of allegations and complaints, they cannot take action as members of departmental communities to identify and address problems. Moreover, the lack of clarity around institutional rules for permissible speech about misconduct fosters a climate where departmental members are encouraged to choose silence and respect for privacy over active engagement in the interest of mutual accountability. This allows for the spread of hurt and suspicion within departments and undercuts the ability of faculty to share necessary information and act to limit the potential for future harm.
The extant Title IX mechanisms also fail to ensure proper redress for survivors of discrimination and harassment. First, when an allegation is made, the burden of investigation falls on one or two individuals within the Office for Dispute Resolution, which prolongs the process unreasonably and leaves hugely consequential decisions to the discretion of too few. Second, participants in ODR investigations are expected to devote an inordinate amount of time to the process. A participant may spend over a hundred hours, sit through numerous days of interviews, and write hundreds of pages over the course of many months to see a complaint through. The impact of this protracted process on training and scholarship can be severe. Third, the ODR process lacks opportunities for participants to educate themselves. The secrecy of proceedings makes it impossible for participants to understand what is entailed in participating in an ODR investigation and impossible for other members of the University to assess whether ODR is applying rules and standards of evidence consistently.
Perhaps the only way to navigate the process knowledgeably is with legal assistance. Yet ODR investigations do not grant complainants or respondents free legal counsel. In instances where the complainant is a student and the accused is a faculty member who has secured legal counsel, the ODR process exacerbates an already existing difference in institutional power and status. Moreover, existing pro bono legal resources are severely overstretched and do not apply to most of the cases handled by ODR.
On the matter of overstretched resources, the existing and documented difficulty of accessing mental health services on campus in a timely manner has been compounded by the turnover and shrinkage of staff in the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, followed by its absorption into the Office of Gender Equity — even as it is well known that the effects of misconduct can be severe for those who have first and second-hand experiences with the behavior in question or even for those who have experienced sexual harassment in the past.
And, finally, there is the issue of neutrality. Complaints submitted to Title IX are sent to ODR for investigation. ODR is staffed by University employees and its findings can be reached in consultation with Harvard’s Office of General Counsel. ODR submits its findings to the appropriate dean who decides on remedial measures. An internal process conducted by University employees can favor protecting the institution from legal liability over a just outcome.
We, on behalf of the signatories of the faculty statement in support of “real recourse,” find these to be insurmountable challenges of the current system and support HGSU's call for a process that is more expedient, transparent, equitable, and independent.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a beautiful day for a strike in Cambridge. Today, Harvard’s graduate student union begins a three-day strike for livable wages and better harassment and assault arbitration — reminding our community this freshman parents weekend that Harvard is unwilling to offer its student workers these protections without a fight.
Despite a flurry of progress in the past 24 hours (a testament to the strike’s utility), the union and University remain at an impasse on bread and butter issues; Harvard’s proposed wage increase still lags behind last year’s cost of living hike in Cambridge, and proposed updates to the University’s internal harassment proceedings insufficiently address the system’s failings. How far the strike moves the needle on negotiations will undoubtedly be influenced by student and faculty support for the union’s disruption of business-as-usual.
To our fellow undergraduates: Don’t cross the picket line. Now is the time to stand with the graduate workers whose care and labor fuels our university. That means not attending class, sections, or office hours which are graduate student-led for the week’s remainder, leaving your 10:30 a.m. class 10 minutes early to join Thursday’s rally in Harvard Yard, and taking the time to join the union at the picket line over the next three days. For undergraduates who work as teaching fellows and course assistants, that means striking.
We’ve acknowledged the disarray and tough choices a strike would inject into undergraduate life. But disruption, again, is the point. Harvard’s product is its academic enterprise; to be effective, a strike has to scramble it.
It was the threat of a strike that pushed the University to move from the 8.5 percent wage increase over three years it proposed in September to the 13 percent over four years it proposed not even 24 hours ago. It's the strike, and the additional federal mediation sessions called in the lead-up to it, that pushed Harvard to raise its paltry $16 minimum wage to $20 as soon as a contract is ratified. And it was the 2016 Harvard University Dining Services worker’s strike which ensured, to this day, that dining hall workers wouldn’t be priced out of their healthcare.
Three days of making tough choices — skipping the section of a beloved class, or, as an undergraduate union member insulated from many of the concerns of graduate students, still withholding your labor in support — can help secure enduring, stronger protections for student workers. Ultimately, students will be left to decide what degree of support they give to the union. But we urge our peers, many of whom might one day be graduate students themselves, to show as much support as possible for striking workers.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers has proven itself willing to negotiate in good faith, giving in on key issues like third-party workplace complaint arbitration. The shift represents a major, and in some ways regrettable, concession for HGSU-UAW. Creating independent channels to arbitrate harassment and discrimination cases has been (and, despite its flexibility, remains) a top union priority since its inception in 2018, and one it previously had to abandon in 2019’s contract negotiation. It's a laudable goal: The University has a streak of mishandling sexual assault cases. A failure of its internal grievance proceedings allowed former government professor Jorge Domínguez to commit repeated acts of sexual misconduct over the course of four decades, and three senior Anthropology professors to weather allegations of sexual harassment for years, including some brought by students. Our graduate workers sorely deserve better alternatives.
In lieu of creating a full-blown third-party arbitration system, the union is now bargaining for the University to subsidize legal counsel for union members undergoing the Title IX process (which, last night, it encouragingly agreed to do to the tune of $50,000) and for the majority of deciders on Title IX hearing panels to have no university affiliation. We hope the union’s seismic movement on the issue, plus momentum from the strike, bring the University back to the bargaining table with renewed willingness to inject more independent arbitration into Harvard’s internal processes.
The second graduate student strike in Harvard’s history is here. The incredible movement on contract negotiations we’ve seen in the past 24 hours alone underscores the power of striking to secure a fairer contract. The union, in making tough concessions and deftly wielding its organizing power, is paving that path. All we have to do is support them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui seeks a third term on the City Council this November, she is making affordable housing and universal pre-K her top priorities.
Siddiqui was first elected to the council in 2017. After winning a second term in 2019, she was elected by a unanimous vote to become the first Muslim mayor in Massachusetts the following January.
Siddiqui immigrated to the United States from Karachi, Pakistan at two years old and grew up in the Roosevelt Towers and Rindge Towers — some of the city’s affordable housing developments. She was educated in the Cambridge public school system, and graduated from Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School.
After earning her bachelor’s degree in public policy from Brown University and law degree from Northwestern, Siddiqui returned to Massachusetts to serve as a legal aid attorney for low-income residents in Greater Boston.
“I really got involved in politics because I felt like I could combine my background in constituent services and policy work and interests to a position where I could have a bigger impact on people as an elected official,” she said. “I've been able to do that.”
As mayor, she helped forge an agreement between the city and the Rindge Associates Limited Partnership to preserve 504 units of affordable housing at Fresh Pond Apartments. Siddiqui listed the agreement — announced on Oct. 13 — as one of her most significant accomplishments.
Siddiqui said she is also proud of her role in leading Cambridge through the pandemic.
“It was such an uncertain time, so I’m just proud that we were able to help so many people, and continue to help a lot of people after such a scary time,” she said.
If reelected, Siddiqui said she hopes to continue her work on affordable housing and take a lead on universal pre-K, including acquiring more property for the city to build affordable units.
Siddiqui also reiterated support for the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers ahead of its second strike in two years.
“The council has spoken out many times in support of the Harvard grad school union,” she said. “I’m there with them.”
At her previous job, she was a member of the National Organization of Legal Services Workers, UAW Local 2320.
With the Nov. 2 election taking place during an off-cycle year, Siddiqui said Cantabrigians should still recognize the importance of their vote, and said she hopes turnout will be strong.
“I hope people vote, it’s so important to vote,” she said. “I think our turnout in local elections isn’t as robust as other cycles, so I just want people to vote, and obviously I’m looking for that number one vote.”
“I think it’s a different kind of election in some ways, post-pandemic, but I think hopefully people are paying attention,” she added.
Living almost her entire life in Cambridge, Siddiqui said this run for reelection is motivated by her desire to give back to the city and its residents.
“This city’s helped me a lot,” she said. “I also recognize that there’s so many people who haven’t been helped, and so I want to close that gap.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An infestation of fruit flies in Adams dining hall has caused distress among residents, who reported flies in their salads, hamburgers, and frozen yogurt.
The insect problem began roughly two weeks ago, students in Adams House said, when innumerable miniature flies descended on the dining hall’s servery and dining area, creeping their way onto diners’ plates. Flies continued to swarm the dining hall as of Tuesday night.
Adams House resident Patrick R. Koenigs ’23 usually eats every meal in the House’s dining hall. He said now, however, he is currently only eating there once per day because the flies make him uncomfortable.
“I remember trying to get ice cream, like soft-serve, and seeing one of them literally coming down as the ice cream was being dispensed, which was just disgusting,” Koenigs said. “While you eat, some people put napkins over their cups, kind of jokingly but also not jokingly. They put napkins over their food when they’re not eating, and it just becomes like a far different experience.”
Though fruit flies are primarily known as “nuisance pests,” a 2018 study by Ecolab Inc. — a pest elimination company — found they can potentially spread bacteria and foodborne pathogens.
Harvard University Dining Services spokesperson Crista Martin wrote in an emailed statement Tuesday that the University took swift action against the infestation and will continue to combat it.
“The issue of fruit flies at Adams House was immediately addressed by multiple University resources to identify the source and then employ safe and effective control measures,” she wrote. “Those efforts are still underway, the issue has abated significantly, and this work will continue.”
HUDS employee Dee L. Ross-Burton, who works in Adams, said the dining staff is taking extra care to clean the dining hall and is using makeshift strategies to mitigate the problem.
“We’re trying to figure out exactly if it’s food, or if it’s fruits, or if it’s something in the drain, we’re not quite sure,” she said. “We’re always trying to clean, clean, clean, clean, and then we put out little vinegar trays where they’ll attract to vinegar,” Ross-Burton said.
She added that a HUDS inspector visited the dining hall Tuesday to study the flies.
Adams resident Morgan L. Whitten ’21-’22 said she is braving the flies to eat in the dining hall.
“I have talked to people who are just trying to be at peace with it, because we do love the dining hall,” she said.
Residents also said they have noticed fewer people frequenting the dining hall, where in addition to eating, students usually study and socialize.
“I was working here last Saturday evening at like 9:30,” Adams House resident and Crimson Arts editor Mikel J. Davies ’23 said. “I was the only person in the dining hall, which is pretty unusual, even for a weekend night.”
Statistics 110: “Introduction to Probability” has even indefinitely moved its office hours from the Adams House dining hall to Kirkland House’s dining hall because of the flies, according to an announcement on the course’s Canvas site.
Though he finds the flies burdensome, Koenigs said they have not tainted his positive views of Adams House.
“The dining staff could not be more friendly, so I never think poorly of Adams House in particular,” he said. “But I do wish this was solved because it’s frustrating and incredibly annoying.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second time in two years, Harvard’s graduate student workers will trade teaching and research for the picket lines as their union begins a three-day strike at 6 a.m. Wednesday, with picketing to set to start at 9 a.m. at Harvard Yard and the Longwood campus.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers failed to reach an agreement with the University Tuesday in the final bargaining session ahead of a strike deadline it set earlier this month, union leadership announced in an email to members Tuesday night.
“We did see some progress in today’s mediated session, but not enough to avoid a strike,” union leaders wrote, arguing that Harvard “refuses to engage” on its longtime key demands: compensation, non-discrimination procedures, and agency shop, which would require all student workers represented by HGSU-UAW to pay dues to the union.
The strike announcement comes hours after Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 released a package of proposals the University shared with the union Tuesday. The proposals include major increases to compensation and new measures for cases of discrimination and harassment, but do not fully meet union demands on either front or address agency shop.
Each day of the strike, the union will host rallies either in the Yard or Science Center Plaza. Picket lines will be set up in the Yard and Longwood from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m and virtual pickets will be hosted from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Throughout the week, the union will also hold events, including a block party on Thursday and a “5k Run for Real Recourse” on Friday.
In addition to official union events, the Student Labor Action Movement — a Phillips Brooks House Association labor advocacy organization — is coordinating an undergraduate walkout on Thursday at 11:35 a.m. to join the picket lines at noon.
Though his email was sent before the official strike announcement, Garber pledged that Harvard would continue bargaining in good faith.
“The University remains committed to our student workers and to the successful conclusion of these negotiations,” Garber wrote.
Union leadership plans to send a counterproposal to Harvard ahead of their next bargaining session on Wednesday at 2:30 p.m., according to HGSU-UAW President Brandon J. Mancilla.
“We are willing to not only just present our proposal, but maybe identify places for compromise within it,” Mancilla said.
Harvard and HGSU-UAW have not scheduled additional bargaining sessions after Wednesday, but both sides say they will continue to communicate throughout the strike.
Amid launching the three-day strike, union leadership alluded to the possibility of a second strike later this term if negotiations stagnate.
“If and when another strike is necessary, the [bargaining committee] will call a second strike with input from you and your stewards,” they wrote. “For now, we need to make sure that Harvard feels the impact of this strike. This strike needs to be as powerful as possible.”
The strike authorization vote that passed overwhelmingly earlier this semester automatically authorizes the bargaining committee to call additional strikes before Dec. 31, Mancilla added.
Harvard spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on the possibility of a second strike.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Science and health journalists discussed reporting on scientific uncertainty, misinformation, and advocacy during the Covid-19 pandemic in a webinar hosted by the Harvard Law School Tuesday.
The event, entitled “Covid-19, Science, and the Media: Lessons Learned Reporting on the Pandemic,” was hosted by the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics at HLS. The panel featured journalists from The New York Times, Nature, Science magazine, and The New Orleans Advocate.
Alexandra L. Phelan, a professor at Georgetown University who moderated the event, asked the panelists to reflect on their reporting during the course of the pandemic.
Nature senior reporter Amy Maxmen said during her reporting on systemic failings that led to or exacerbated the pandemic, she found that “data was often lacking” because of an absence of a national data sharing system.
“There’s not a lot of incentives or need for places to share information — like prisons don’t necessarily need to report outbreaks to the CDC,” she said.
Apoorva Mandavilli, a science and global health reporter for The Times, said she observed “an unprecedented level of misinformation” during the pandemic, which has allowed her to grow as a journalist.
“This pandemic has been an exercise in not just doing journalism, but truth telling and correcting untruths on a pretty regular basis in a way that we don’t necessarily have to do all the time when we’re writing about other things,” she said.
The panelists also discussed reporting on scientific uncertainty in the pandemic, and the best methods to communicate findings to the general public.
Mandavilli said it is important to be transparent and honest with findings, arguing that though many fault the general public’s low scientific literacy for their mistrust in science, public health leaders often “skipped a lot of nuance” and “pretended certainty.”
Kai Kupferschmidt, a Science magazine contributing correspondent, added journalists should advocate for the truth, even in times of uncertainty.
“We can be advocates for trying to get as close as possible to the truth and we do know sometimes when something is not true, and we can be advocates for that nuance,” he said.
Regarding the role of advocacy in journalism, Maxmen said though she is not an opinion writer and does not advocate for her own opinions in her stories, the stories she decides to cover can demonstrate her biases.
In an interview following the event, Petrie-Flom Center communications associate Chloe Reichel — who also introduced the webinar — said public health journalists are up against a wall of public optimism.
“It seems to me that there’s sort of a general public sentiment — vaccines are here, the pandemic is over,” she said. “I don’t know how media outlets will be able to convey the gravity of the situation and the ongoing risk in the face of public sentiments that really just want things to be over.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 31, 2021 at 11:45 p.m.
After its site went down without explanation, students alleged that a matchmaking survey that circulated among Harvard students earlier this month soliciting students’ personal information — including racial and sexual preferences — was a scam.
The survey targeting Harvard students modeled itself off of “Marriage Pact,” a service launched by students at Stanford and active on 62 college campuses that matches students with “backup” spouses.
The Harvard marriage survey began circulating on campus several weeks ago, publicized through an Instagram account and flyers posted across campus. The ostensible matchmaking service claimed it would send respondents their matches on Oct. 15. After collecting a wealth of personal data from Harvard students, however, its website and social media disappeared before the announced deadline.
On Oct. 31, the service seemingly reemerged — now branded as ExExEx — and emailed participants their “match.”
The survey asked students questions ranging from their views on abortion to how “submissive/dominant” they want to be in a relationship to their level of sexual experience, according to respondents and screenshots of the survey.
Liam J. McGregor, who founded the true campus match-making service at Stanford in 2017, confirmed in an interview that Harvard’s campus is not one on which Marriage Pact operates. Once he became aware of the survey on Harvard’s campus, McGregor said he direct messaged the Instagram account, but never received a response.
“We tried to reach out, all kinds of different ways,” McGregor said. “We told them, ‘Hey, we love the enthusiasm, but this is not okay.’”
Without explicitly mentioning the marriage survey, Harvard warned students to be wary of giving away sensitive information in the College’s weekly update email sent to undergraduates Thursday.
“Some community members have reported concerns about online or digital scams,” the email stated. “Be wary of providing personal information to anyone whose name or number you don’t recognize.”
College spokesperson Rachael Dane did not respond to multiple requests for comment asking whether Harvard was aware of the marriage survey.
William Q. “Will” McKibben ’25 said he took the survey after seeing a flyer in the Science Center.
“All the questions seemed to be very psychoanalytic,” he said. “None of them were trivial. It was not like ‘What’s your favorite hobby?’”
Harvard students operate their own matchmaking service on campus called Datamatch, which matches students with potential friends and partners every Valentine’s Day. McKibben said the presence of that matchmaking service at Harvard was one of the reasons why he did not question the marriage survey’s authenticity.
“I didn’t really think there was anything initially that I noticed that would make me think it was fake,” McKibben said. “I’d seen other things before — either through other campuses or through Harvard — of matching students with each other.”
Though he provided the service with his personal information, McKibben said he is not distressed.
“I don’t know that any of the data that I would have given would be incriminating, or if it did come out, that it would be a big deal,” McKibben said.
McKibben also said he was not “disgruntled” or “super upset” about not receiving a match on the announced date.
“But it’s kind of a bummer,” McKibben said. “It would have been interesting to see who I would have gotten.”
CORRECTION: October 31, 2021
A previous version of this article used language that described the matchmaking survey as a scam. In fact, students only alleged at the time that it was a scam.

Washington Post journalist Seung Min Kim and Cook Political Report Editor-in-Chief Amy E. Walter discussed the intersection between national and local politics in a forum hosted by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics on Tuesday evening.
Moderated by Washington Post chief correspondent and IOP Resident Fellow Dan Balz, the forum addressed pressing local political issues and their relevance in the national political arena.
Kim said Biden faces a challenge in juggling both his domestic agenda and his international and climate goals. She noted the president’s upcoming international trips to Glasgow and Rome have been “overshadowed” by coverage of his domestic agenda.
“It's just been basically a giant game of Whack-a-Mole — like you feel like you fix one problem and then another problem pops up,” Kim said. “And that's just been such a really confounding puzzle for Biden, for Democratic leaders.”
Walter said Biden began the summer with “a plan that looked pretty good” — expecting a strong economy and recovery from Covid-19— but the president’s goals lost momentum as the Delta variant spread.
“Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth,” she said, referencing a quote from boxer Mike Tyson.
“Starting in June or July, Covid became much less of a hot [vaccination] summer and much more of a hot mess summer,” Walter added.
Kim and Walter both noted the national implications of the upcoming gubernatorial election in Virginia, scheduled for Nov. 2. Former Governor Terence R. “Terry” McAuliffe, a Democrat, will face off against Republican candidate Glenn A. Youngkin.
“What's been interesting is just to talk to House Democrats, particularly about what impact a Terry McAuliffe loss would have on their agenda and their efforts to pass the big social spending climate package,” Kim said.
Virginia resident Tarina K. Ahuja ’24, who attended the event, said she believes the election may help redefine the relationship between state and national politics, along with the future of the Democratic Party’s mobilization efforts.
“Not only is it important for the future of my state, of my home, but it’s also important for the nation and thinking about what is the future of the Democratic Party,” Ahuja said.
Kim also said congressional democrats are looking to this election to gauge their chances in the 2022 midterms, given that the party in the White House has historically performed poorly.
Walter added that constituents previously evaluated their congressperson and the president’s performance separately, but the internet and the loss of local news has caused members of Congress — often viewed as accountable to their states and districts — to be “lumped in with the national.”
“They were able to sort of be seen as something separate than what was going on in Washington,” she said. “So you could hate the person in the White House, but still like your person.”
Robert Fogel ’25, an IOP member, said the event fit in well with this semester’s theme of democracy.
“A big point of these forums in general, but particularly tonight, is to make students think about the current political situation and what they may believe to be true about a small election actually has broader implications and greater meanings for the nation at large,” he said.

Since Harvard and its graduate student union began negotiations in March, the road to a second contract has seen seven months of bargaining, one contract extension, a virtual walkout, and two rallies. On Wednesday morning, the union will launch its second strike in two years.
Graduate and undergraduate student workers and their supporters are headed to picket lines in Harvard Yard and Longwood, with the union’s bargaining committee confirming Tuesday night that the strike will begin at 6 a.m.
From the outset of negotiations, Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers stood firm on several key demands, including compensation and benefits, third-party arbitration for claims of identity-based discrimination and sexual harassment, and agency shop, which requires all student workers represented by the union to pay union dues to cover bargaining costs.
These same issues hampered negotiations for HGSU-UAW’s first contract with Harvard, leading the union to go on strike for 29 days in December 2019. The following July, the union ratified its first contract after nearly two years of negotiations.
Nonetheless, the one-year contract did not contain provisions for agency shop or independent arbitration of harassment and discrimination.
Seven Months of Bargaining
A month into negotiations for a second contract, in April 2021, HGSU-UAW and the University opened up their Zoom bargaining sessions to union membership. Members observing the negotiations said they felt frustrated at what they described as repeated “stalling” and “questioning” of HGSU-UAW’s proposals by the University, specifically those dealing with the discrimination and harassment grievance process.
With the expiration of the first contract impending at the end of June, more than 600 student workers pledged to organize a strike should the University continue to reject the union’s key proposals. At a June 30 bargaining session, members left the Zoom in protest against the University’s proposal for one-time bonuses instead of percent raises.
As bargaining dragged on, the two sides agreed to extend the current contract to Aug. 31. In July, the union filed an unfair labor practice charge against the University with the National Labor Relations Board, alleging that Harvard failed to provide information on the bargaining unit and University policies.
With major issues still unresolved, the union announced in August that it would hold a strike authorization vote in September. Union membership overwhelmingly authorized a strike with 92 percent of voters in favor.
Compromise as Strike Looms
On the University’s side, Harvard’s bargaining team has put forth several proposal packages in recent months. In September, it increased its compensation and benefits proposals and introduced an unprecedented third-party arbitration appeals process for cases not related to Title IX or other gender-based discrimination and harassment.
Last week, the union conceded its long-standing demand for third-party arbitration of gender-based discrimination and sexual harassment cases, but maintained its demands for legal expense funds, third-party arbitration for all non-Title IX cases, and that Title IX panels be composed of a majority of third-party individuals.
On Tuesday, in another new proposal package, Harvard suggested arbitration for non-Title IX cases of discrimination and harassment as proposed in the August package, as well as two new provisions: non-binding mediation after student workers follow the internal appeals processes for all discrimination and harrassment cases, as well as a legal expense fund of $50,000 per fiscal year.
Under the proposal, all complaints of discrimination and harassment would still first be required to be processed under Harvard’s internal procedures. Then, for certain Title IX-related cases, student workers may appeal the decision — if the union decides it is dissatisfied with the results of the internal appeal, it can then take the matter to mediation with a mediator selected by the union and the University, though the decision does not impose anything on the accused party.
For non-Title IX-related cases, if a case is appealed internally under University procedures and HGSU-UAW is dissatisfied with the result, the union can also take the matter to mediation.
Tuesday’s package also includes a $21 million increase to compensation and benefits for a four-year contract — a $7 million increase from the last comprehensive proposal package released Aug. 31 for a three-year contract.
“The University remains committed to continuing negotiations in good faith and reaching a contract agreement,” Harvard Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote in a University-wide email Tuesday.
Union Pushes Ahead 
Despite these proposals, HGSU-UAW decided Tuesday to move forward with its three-day strike, arguing that the package does not meet the union’s demands for greater raises, agency shop, and majority third-party representation on hearing panels for discrimination and harassment claims. The union articulated these demands in a counterproposal it sent to Harvard Tuesday night, according to an email to membership.
In preparation for Wednesday’s picket lines, many teaching fellows have informed their students of their plans to withhold labor. Some distributed an undergraduate FAQ created by the union and a strike support letter for students to add their signatures.
Bastian Lasse, a teaching fellow for German 20A: “Intermediate German” who also participated in HGSU-UAW’s 2019 strike, said he decided to strike again after seeing that the University did not meet the union’s demands on issues like procedures for sexual harassment complaints.
“The bargaining team reached out their hands, and the University repeatedly neglected to shake hands with the bargaining team,” he said.
Hallie C. Zenga-Josephson ’24, an undergraduate course assistant for Math MA: “Introduction to Functions and Calculus I,” said she decided to strike to help demonstrate the power of student workers.
“It will really show the school how valuable our student workers are, and hopefully it will help the progress with bargaining,” she said.
Denish K. Jaswal, a teaching fellow for Philosophy 129: “Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason” and a co-chair of the HGSU-UAW Contract Enforcement and Education Committee, said the pandemic has made it difficult to organize student workers, but she hopes the three-day strike will exhibit the union’s support network and the potential damage of a longer strike.
“These three days will be a very strong show of the support that we really do have, and they will disrupt the University,” she said. “This is kind of a warning to Harvard that says, ‘Hey, we’re going to give you three days of what a strike will look like. Do you really want this for your university?’”
“If you don’t, please actually bargain with us in good faith,” Jaswal added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It took just four minutes into the game for the Crimson (10-1-1, 3-1-0 Ivy League) to get onto the scoreboard, when junior forward Angela Caloia found the back of the net with a blistering shot, thanks in part to precise playmaking and assists from senior midfielder/forward Sophie Hirst and first-year midfielder Hannah Bebar. This quick goal was a strong start to Harvard’s 3-0 victory over Central Connecticut State University (10-5-0, 7-2 Northeast Conference).
“We knew we needed to come out firing offensively, and we did just that in the first half,” coach Chris Hamblin said. “We had a lot of really good moments in possession, and I think the team applied itself really well tonight and executed the plans we had.”
After a series of shots on goal, the Crimson managed to sneak another shot past junior Blue Devil goalie Amanda McQuillan. In the 25th minute, sophomore defender Taylor Fasnacht slashed into the front third and found the back of the net from the right side of the field. Harvard managed to keep momentum on its side after an offside call. After regaining possession, Caloia took a pass from Fasnacht and guided it into the back of the net for her second goal of the game.
The Blue Devils started to take control of the game after the trio of goals from the Crimson. Central Connecticut dominated possession for the rest of the first half, as one of its forwards, first-year Kristina Kelly, managed to fire three shots toward the goal.
The Blue Devils carried their momentum into the second half. They sent another three shots towards the goal but were never able to break through for their first goal. Despite this early onslaught, Harvard remained in control the rest of the game. However, it failed to add to its three-goal margin.
The Crimson looked to get many different players time on the pitch and match experience. All but two starters were substituted out of the game. Harvard also deployed the use of three different goalkeepers, junior Hannah Gardner, sophomore Anna Karpenko, and senior Samantha Schmitz, to shut out the Blue Devils.
Coming off a tough loss last week against No. 22 Brown (10-3-0, 5-0), the Crimson managed to come back into form brimming with confidence and composure as it executed its plans strategically and precisely, giving an all around comprehensive performance and looking solid on both offensive and defensive fronts throughout the game.
“I think it was a really comprehensive performance, and I’m really proud of how we responded after a tough result on Saturday,” said a proud Hamblin after the match. “We talked about it as a team, we didn’t have much time but watched videos, strategized and talked about execution, especially in the final third and getting around the corner with our wide players, and we did just that.”
Next up for Harvard is the third of a four-game homestand at Jordan Field. The Saturday matchup with No. 23/NR Princeton (11-2-1, 3-1) is extremely important for the Crimson as it seeks to remain competitive in the Ivy League standings. Harvard hopes to carry the momentum from this game into the weekend as it vies for a postseason berth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s tennis team’s quest for the ITA Fall Nationals in San Diego continued at the ITA Northeast Regional Championship in Philadelphia this past weekend.
After six days of exciting competition, the Crimson secured a doubles title when senior Brian Shi and first-year Daniel Milavsky edged out a tough Cornell duo in a heated contest.
Along with the doubles title, Harvard had two of the four singles semifinalists in Milavsky and junior Harry Walker.
“Everybody had a signature moment,” said head coach Andrew Rueb. “The team has a lot of depth and has done a lot of work to get to this point. We’re making progress day-by-day.”
The weekend tournament was a qualifier for the ITA Fall Nationals, which features 32 of the top men’s singles and doubles teams in the country. The tournament serves as a “grand slam” of the fall tennis season.
With the victory, Milavsky and Shi qualified for the doubles bracket of the ITA Fall Nationals in San Diego. They will join sophomore Henry Von Der Schulenburg, who qualified in the singles division at the Milwaukee Tennis Classic earlier this year.
Among the other participants in the tournament for the Crimson were sophomore Ronan Jachuck, junior Steven Sun, and first-years David Lins and Niels Korsgaard.
Before his defeat in the quarterfinals, Jachuck defeated opponents from Penn, 7-5, 1-6, 7-6(2), and Princeton, 6-5, 6-1. Sun defeated Bryant’s Diego Serra Sparrow, 6-2, 6-4, before falling to Columbia’s Alex Kotzen in the Round of 32.
Korsgaard lost a tough match to Dartmouth’s Alex Knox-Jones 6-4, 6-4. Lins advanced to the Round of 16 with wins over Penn’s Aditya Gupta, 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, and Princeton’s Damian Rodriguez, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4.
Along the way to the semifinals, Milavsky defeated nationally ranked Karl Poling out of Princeton, 7-5, 7-5.
“Just hitting the checklist every day in practice and trusting myself in those big moments has helped me step up when needed,” Milavsky said.
As the spring approaches, Harvard will begin to turn its attention towards the regular season, which is full of head-to-head matchups.
“There is a lot to build on here, going forward to the dual match season,” Rueb said.
“I have been working with my coaches at becoming a smarter player, being more disciplined with my shot selection, and staying level-headed under pressure,” Milavsky added. “These are some of the things I will continue to work on to be ready for the spring.”
The Crimson remains at home for its next event this weekend, starting on October 28th. Harvard will host the Crimson Halloween Invite, which will feature players from Cornell, Dartmouth, Brown, and Yale.
