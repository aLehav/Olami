After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Economic sanctions are to foreign policy as water is to medicine. Sanctions are prescribed for nearly all circumstances and, like water, they are often suggested as solutions with the implication that “it can’t hurt.” As Syria pivots toward civil war and Iran pivots toward nuclear armament, sanction is today’s buzzword, as demonstrated in its multiple appearances in last Tuesday’s Republican presidential candidate debate. As Texas Governor Rick Perry quickly realized after suggesting sanctions on Iran’s central bank, the details and effects of sanctions are multifarious. Amid the hysterical promotion of sanctions as a diplomatic panacea our politicians and their gullible constituents conveniently forget that they are square pegs in a world densely packed with round holes.
According to proponents of sanctions, last Friday should have been a momentous day for the restoration of peace in Syria and for the legitimacy of the Arab League. Friday was the deadline set by the Arab League for the Syrian government to let in neutral observers for the purpose of establishing a stable path to peace. Friday’s passing without even the latest nonsensical and explosive Syrian conspiracy theories was, depending on one’s perspective, either a symbolic whimper or the equivalent of a pejorative flipping of the bird. As expected, Arab finance ministers met this weekend in Cairo, producing on Sunday what appears to be a range of harsh sanctions.
Some observers assert that America’s implementation of sanctions since 2003 was integral to the inception of Syria’s civil revolt earlier this year, but frankly one cannot assess with great accuracy the true effects of American sanctions on Syria. The 25 percent drop in Syrian oil production in the period from 2003 to 2010 and the nearly parallel fall in government revenue could be attributed to issues besides America’s economic sanctions. As Bassam Haddad wrote in Middle East Policy earlier this year, “Through the end of 2010, Syria seemed relatively stable both politically and economically as other countries in the region experienced turbulence in either or both areas.” Only those wearing tinted glasses could conclude that America’s sanctions were decisive in fomenting today’s unrest.
Russia and China are the world’s remaining holdouts for sanctions against Syria. Both states vetoed an October United Nations Security Council resolution that condemned Syria’s response to civil unrest and likely would have lead to UN sanctions. The Arab League’s tardy yet strong stance on Syria may weaken Russia and China’s resolve—ostensibly premised on sensitivity to the region’s internal politics—but it will not affect Syria economically to a significant degree. Both Lebanon and Iraq are refusing to adopt the sanctions and, as Syria’s first and third greatest trade partners, respectively, among the Arab world, their refusal greatly diminishes the authority of the sanctions.
Ironically, China and Russia’s cynical preference of its economic interests over humanitarian concerns is best explained by the prior sanctions against Syria over the last decade. America first leveled sanctions against Syria in 2003 and since then the magnitude of the sanctions oscillated from a peak after the assassination of Lebanese prime minister Rafik B. E. Hariri in 2005 to a nadir at the naïve early stages of the Obama administration. Nonetheless, throughout that period our unilateral sanctions (with scattered and minimal European support) served to strengthen Syria’s economic ties with China and Russia. Russia won a $2.7 billion contract to construct an oil processing plant in Syria. The China National Petroleum Corporation also expanded its oil interest in the Arab country.
A popular argument for implementing unilateral sanctions or even multilateral sanctions without global support is that they “set the stage” for broader sanctions. Syria reveals that this truism is accepted primarily for its repetition and not its veracity. After sanctions are leveled by America or some states in Western Europe, the rest of the world gratefully and predictably does its best to fill the economic vacuum. Economic sanctions, even when they are unilateral, are damaging, particularly for a smaller and inefficient government. Nonetheless, the past decade in foreign policy toward Syria illustrates how these “first round” sanctions often incentivize and entrench economic and political ties between the sanctioned country and those states that are ironically supposed to participate in the “second round” of sanctions.
Even worse, American sanctions deepened Syria’s relations with Venezuela, Iran, and other American foes. For instance, in 2007, following a steep decline in the presence of American oil companies, Syria partnered with Iran and Venezuela to develop a $1.5 billion oil refinery in Damascus. Ironically, our economic sanctions against Syria only deepened Syria’s economic ties with Iran. The economic interdependence of enemies is a common second level effect of sanctions. Naturally, economic interdependence reinforces political and social ties.
Over the last year we heard the suggestion that for Libya, Iran, Syria, and others, multilateral actions are more favorable than unilateral actions regardless of their effectiveness because of the superior “message” implied in multilateral actions. Syria demonstrates that whether sanctions are from one country or six is irrelevant. European sanctions were pivotal while American sanctions were toothless messages because of market shares. Likewise, Arab League sanctions become irrelevant when their big players decide not to play along.
The only thing that matters, especially when dealing with countries that could care less about an international or Western humanitarian consensus, are the market effects of sanctions. It’s the economy, stupid.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As members of Occupy Harvard, we are writing in response to your letter to the members of the Harvard Community sent on Monday, Nov. 21.
Thank you for recognizing the important conversations our movement has generated, and of the centrality of free speech and debate for Harvard as an institution of higher education. We appreciate your concern for the safety of all members of the Harvard community, including the occupants of our encampment in Harvard Yard.
However, we are concerned with your characterization of our movement. As stated in a motion passed at our first general assembly on Nov. 9, we have been committed to being peaceful in all our actions. Exceptions to peaceful conduct from that night can be cited from both sides, but these isolated events do not speak to the broader principles and behaviors that drive either side. You make reference to incidents of sexual assault at other Occupy sites, which are abhorrent. However, we invite you to compare the number of such incidents with that of sexual assaults occurring, for example, on Harvard’s campus and in final clubs.
Given that we have made a public commitment to nonviolence, we request that you do the same. In light of brutal institutional acts carried out by police at the University of California Davis and Berkeley, the Harvard Undergraduate Council passed a resolution calling for “the continued support of the right of students to peaceful protest without violent response by the Harvard administration, the Harvard University Police Department, as well as student unions, university administrations and police departments across the US." We share that sentiment, and we ask that you make a public commitment that the University and its agents will refrain from the use of violence against Occupy Harvard.
As we share your concern with violence, so do we share your concern with free speech. A number of faculty have written to you asking that you open the gates of the Yard, and some are holding classes off-campus in protest against the gate closure. We agree with this sentiment, we think that speech cannot genuinely be free in a location heavily locked down by security, with public access largely eliminated.
Over the past weeks, we have received strong support from the Harvard community and have enjoyed productive conversations with many students at the encampment. At the same time, the closure of the Yard has divided the campus community, and created an atmosphere of anger and frustration that has stymied constructive debate within Harvard and strangled exchange with the world outside it. It has enabled, rather than prevented, individual acts of verbal and physical abuse directed at the encampment by certain inebriated students late at night. If Harvard genuinely cared about freedom of speech, the health and well being of its own campus, and its obligations to a community larger than the one that lies within its walls, it would open its gates
Let us now focus the discussion on one of the real issues at hand. Controlled by the world’s second-largest non-profit, Harvard’s $32 billion endowment is larger than the gross domestic products of more than half the countries in the world. Why are Harvard’s investments opaque to the Harvard community? How can we be confident that Harvard’s investments are socially responsible? We appreciate that you, as the President, play multiple roles within this university. You are both the leader of a community of scholars and an employee of the Harvard Corporation. When conflict arises between these two allegiances, whom do you serve?
We want to know, and we want Harvard to be held accountable. The scholars who contribute lifetimes of hard work and research, elevating Harvard’s prestige, winning grants and garnering huge donations, should have a say in how our contributions to Harvard are impacting the broader world. As far as we know now, there is a deep void of transparency and accountability with regard to the broader impact of Harvard’s investments. This is not only a problem of management, but also a problem of morality.
We invite you to a discussion of this and other issues that have led to the creation of the Occupy Harvard movement and maintain hopes that we will have substantive opportunities to engage with you on the pressing issues of integrity and fairness that are causing growing discontent on campus. Members of your administration have declined to attend any of the general assemblies to which they have been invited and have pulled out of two discussion events to which they had previously committed: the general assembly of Nov. 10 and the Dudley House discussion forum of Nov. 21. We are a horizontal and democratic movement and we invite you, again, to attend one of our general assemblies, which take place on Mondays and Thursdays at 6 p.m. in the Yard, right outside your office.
By the time this letter appears in print Harvard Yard will have been locked down for nearly three weeks. A movement rooted in the reclamation of public space and an enhanced engagement with fundamental ideals of democracy and equality has been met with repression and a retreat into exclusion, a breed of fear that is the most regrettable byproduct of privilege. We call upon you, and our University, to do better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We will remember last week’s Harvard-Yale game more for tragedy than for victory. At 10:30 a.m., as students were still arriving at the pre-game tailgate, a U-Haul driven by a Yale student accelerated into a crowd. The truck hit three women before it ran into another U-Haul. One of the women, Massachusetts resident Nancy Barry, died as a result of the accident; another woman was seriously injured. This horrifying tragedy has caused many to think hard about what regulations universities should impose on students at events like the annual Harvard-Yale tailgate.
Although the accident was not determined to be the result of alcohol consumption, allowing U-Hauls in a space crowded with people drinking and partying always has the potential to end in disaster. Harvard banned U-Hauls at its Harvard-Yale tailgates in 2004. Although the main justification for the ban was the costly damage large trucks did to athletic fields, Harvard administrators also worried about the safety of students dancing on top of U-Hauls during the tailgate.
The conversation about safety restrictions at tailgates is very important but also very complicated. Students should certainly criticize tailgate regulations that they deem unnecessarily strict or ineffectual, but it is important to recognize that these rules exist for good reason. Lenient policies or lax enforcement of regulations can lead to unfortunate circumstances and tragic accidents. On the other hand, tightly controlling students’ ability to drink alcohol can drive them to pre-game in their own rooms or off-campus houses, often resulting in students drinking large quantities of alcohol in a dangerously short period of time more than standard tailgate imbibing would have them do. Harvard must continue to navigate the tight pathway between allowing students to enjoy themselves in supervised and school-sanctioned tailgates and ensuring the safety of all game attendees.
Tailgates are by nature disorganized and difficult to control, and accidents can happen in any environment when excitement and nerves are high. Unfortunately, even the most carefully crafted tailgate rules cannot account for all eventualities. Many factors that university-imposed restrictions don’t influence or take into account can influence tailgate safety, and rules that are effective at Yale may not be relevant at Harvard. For example, a longer distance between tailgate and stadium may discourage students from heading back in the middle of the game to continue drinking, causing them to drink more before the game begins. Because of the many factors involved, we recognize that although this freak accident might have been prevented by banning U-Hauls at the Yale tailgate, such a rule will not prevent all possible future accidents.
Tailgating the Harvard-Yale game is a time-honored tradition for the students and alumni of Harvard and Yale, and for many, the tailgate is inextricable from The Game itself. Harvard must recognize that students will inevitably enjoy the Harvard-Yale game in traditional fashion; tailgate regulations should serve to ensure safety, not prevent students from enjoying themselves. Yale has historically done a good job planning its tailgates to be enjoyable and inclusive while ensuring the safety of game attendees.
This year’s accident was undoubtedly just that, but it does serve as a reminder that regulating tailgates well can be extremely difficult. As our thoughts go out to the family and friends of Nancy Barry, we hope that her tragic death will lead to more careful and considerate tailgating in the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Sunday, Nov. 6, thousands of people from across the country circled the White House to protest the proposed construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline. The pipeline would transport oil extracted from the bitumen sands in Canada to the largest U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast. Climate activists have come out in vehement opposition to the pipeline because it would increase U.S. dependence on energy derived from the carbon-intensive oil sands. Although the Keystone pipeline would have deep ramifications on the environment, its portrayal as a crucial tipping point in the climate change movement is myopic considering the scale of our national mission to reduce overall carbon dioxide emissions. Protesters should do their best to stop the pipeline and the United States should make an aggressive move towards adopting and improving alternative energy sources to replace oil, but this process of achieving independence from oil must be approached holistically and realistically.
The pipeline has garnered attention from protestors and the media because it has been portrayed as a gateway to U.S. dependence on increasingly carbon-intensive resources. The Canadian Government released statistics stating that the process of extracting and refining the oil from the Alberta oil sands could emit up to 35% more greenhouse gases than the average conventional oil refined in the U.S.  Climate activists see the U.S. interest in these increasingly hard to access and carbon-intensive sources of oil such as oil sands and shale oil as the beginning of a downward trend. In the context of the Obama administration’s goal to cut carbon dioxide emissions 83 percent from 2005 levels by 2050, environmental activists see the construction of the pipeline as a step in the opposite direction. NASA’s leading climate scientist, James Hansen went as far as to condemn the pipeline as “game over” for climate change if the Administration was to continue pursuing these sources of oil in the future.
Although we do not want to increase our dependence on oil sands or other carbon-intensive sources of oil in the long term, the construction of the Keystone pipeline is only a small part of our national oil dependency issue. Blocking the Keystone pipeline could maintain the current level of dependence, but the U.S. already imports 20 percent of its oil from Canada, and 47 percent of the crude oil produced in Canada come from oil sands. The Keystone pipeline could increase U.S. imports of Canadian oil by over 500,000 barrels per day, but within the context of the larger 19 million barrels of oil the U.S. consumes per day, this only makes up a small fraction of national oil consumption.
Instead of focusing so much attention on the singular mission of blocking this pipeline, we must think of how we can put the nation in the best economic position to end its dependence on oil. In the context of confronting and mitigating climate change, oil is one of the hardest areas to address because it is hard to find cheap, clean alternatives. Although oil only accounts for 20 percent of energy use in the U.S., it comprises 95 percent of energy consumption in the transportation sector.  The transportation sector almost exclusively relies on oil products such as gasoline and diesel because they are easier to transport at low costs. Alternatives such as natural gas have to be compressed into liquid natural gas before they can be transported through a pipeline.  Electric and hybrid vehicles may solve this problem, but gas powered vehicles are still cheaper and therefore the natural consumer choice.  Although the continued adoption of oil infrastructure such as the Keystone pipeline will not help clear the channels for new technology to develop, it is also unfortunately clear that the economics of alternatives to oil will have to be more affordable before they are widely adopted in the U.S.
Therefore, as a nation we must develop an environment where renewable technology will be affordable and competitive with fossil fuels. If the pipeline was used as a means through which we can maintain a steady supply of cheap oil while simultaneously developing competitive renewable options and closing down polluting infrastructure such as a coal plants, it may be far better received.
Currently, all environmentalists see is Obama’s empty promises of setting a course of action to reduce carbon dioxide emissions drastically by 2050 while on the ground he is supporting the plan to build this highly polluting pipeline. However, if the Obama Administration were to publicize a plan of how they could use transition pieces like this pipeline to meet their energy goals, the national reaction would be far different. The construction of Keystone, therefore, will only be “game over” if the administration treats it as a stepping-stone for further exploration of carbon intensive oil resources instead of a piece of our national transition off of oil.
So yes, we should stop the Keystone pipeline as long as the government presents its construction without the context of a clear plan of action to reduce emissions. However, we must also pressure the government to take aggressive steps in developing the scenario through which the nation’s future emissions will be reduced as planned.

Looking to study cooperation in action, a team of Harvard social scientists opted to forgo the all too familiar practice of hiring hordes of undergraduates and Cambridge residents as test subjects.
Instead, Human Evolutionary Biology lecturer David G. Rand and his team turned to Amazon.com’s “Mechanical Turk,” a website that recruits thousands of people from around the globe to do work that machines cannot. Amazon labels the site, “Artificial Artificial Intelligence.”
Researchers have used the Mechanical Turk to organize volunteers through the internet to perform basic tasks for pay, such as text transcription and caption composition for online search engines.
Now social scientists like Rand and his team have begun to use the site to hire volunteers for surveys and tests. Compared to a traditional lab, the Mechanical Turk can perform the same studies for a tenth of the time and cost, according to Rand.
“It’s really changing the face of social science studies,” he said.
The subject pool recruited through the Mechanical Turk is “not a true cross-section, but more representative than Harvard undergrads,” said Samuel Arbesman, co-author of the study and a senior scholar at the Kauffman Foundation. “We create a simple model under the assumption that this simple model incorporates a certain amount of truth for the world at large.”
In the study, the research team assigned 800 volunteers an equal number of points to trade. Players could donate their points to their small group or keep the points for themselves.
After each trial, researchers told players about the choices of other group members.
In a paper published Nov. 14 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the team, which also included Professor Nicholas A. Christakis, concluded that dynamic social networks promote cooperation and friendliness.
Generous players tended to remain within networks, while selfish players often became isolated.
The threat of social alienation discourages selfish behavior, while cooperative behavior yields social inclusion, the study found.
After exclusion from a group, volunteers who had originally refused to donate their points were twice as eager to cooperate, the study found.
“We know that cooperation is very important for maintaining any society,” Arbesman said. But this study, he said, took a unique approach by examining how cooperation within groups changes over time.
The experiment is among the first to explore the cooperation of large groups within a dynamic social environment, where participants have the power to choose to maintain or abandon certain relationships, Rand said.
Experimenters said the ability of participants to rework their ties to each other within the study emulated a more natural paradigm.
It’s “advantageous to be cooperative,” Rand said.

One of the pioneers of the case study method, Harvard Business School Professor Emeritus Charles M. Williams died of congestive heart failure on Nov. 17 in Needham, Mass. He was 94 years old.
Williams was best known for his work in commercial banking and his use of the case method style of teaching. His trademark class, “Management of Financial Institutions,” consistently attracted record numbers of students.
“He was a brilliant teacher,” said Samuel L. Hayes III, an emeritus professor at the Business School and one of Williams’ former students. “He made otherwise dull financial statements come alive. He made [financial analysis] a detective story.”
A West Virginia native, Williams learned the principles of banking from his father, a local banker during the Great Depression.
“My father gave me a respect for the fundamentals,” Williams once said, according to a Business School press release. “Know your customers and work with them.”
After graduating Phi Beta Kappa with a degree in history and economics from Washington and Lee University, Williams entered Harvard Business School at the tender age of 19. He then joined the loan department at Manufacturers Trust in New York City.
In 1941, he volunteered for the U.S. Navy. As an ensign, Williams served as the paymaster for the aircraft carrier USS Lexington and taught at the Naval Supply Corps School at Harvard.
After being discharged, Williams returned to the Business School in 1947, this time as an assistant professor. At Harvard, Williams earned a doctorate in commercial science, and in 1956, he received tenure and became a full professor.
As a teacher, Williams was known for his iconic use of a pointer.
“He had this long wooden pointer with a rubber tip at the end,” Hayes said. “He would prowl the classroom with it.”
Williams taught classes to both Business School students and executives in professional development programs.
In a 1990 interview, Williams said that working with executives allowed him to explore business problems. “I was learning as much as I was teaching,” he said.
Williams was also active in business consulting, serving as a board member for Keystone Custodial Funds and as a trustee for the Chase Manhattan Mortgage and Realty Trust. He published hundreds of articles and cases and coauthored “Basic Business Finance,” a textbook that was used by over 300 colleges and universities.
“As a teacher, researcher, author, wise counsel, and good friend, Charlie Williams has had an enormous impact over the years on all of us at HBS as well as upon the entire banking industry,” former Business School Dean John H. McArthur, who was a student of Williams, said in a press release.
Williams is survived by his wife, Elizabeth Huffman, and his two children and three grandchildren. A memorial service will occur at the First Parish Church of Weston on December 3 at 10:30 a.m.

Rather than fly home to Saudi Arabia to spend Thanksgiving with his family, Ghassan S. Gammoh ’14 spent his Thanksgiving at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter. He and 25 other students from Harvard, Wellesley, Tufts and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst came together over the course of the holiday to cook, feed, and spend time with some of Harvard Square’s homeless residents.
The shelter, normally open from 7:00 p.m. until 8:00 a.m. each night, kept its doors open the entire day, serving homemade chili for lunch, a pancake breakfast, and a dinner that included two turkeys.
“It was a really rewarding experience,” said Gammoh, who cleaned dishes and talked with many of the guests. “It was so great that everyone got a meal on Thanksgiving.”
This year, the shelter saw several other members of the community in Cambridge pitch in. A local family came out to prepare a homemade chili for lunch, while several other volunteers from a local church pitched in to prepare the Thanksgiving feast, which, according to Mateus C. Falci ’14, was a big hit with the shelter’s visitors.
“It’s nice to be able to stay all day,” said Falci, who supervised many of the day’s volunteers. “We’re able to sit and chat with the guests. Everyone gets to be happy.”
The Harvard Square Homeless Shelter is the only completely student-run homeless shelter in the country, and has a long history of bringing Harvard students in touch with Cambridge’s large homeless population.
“I got to talk to one of the men about being Arab, and we talked about the issues and differences between there and here, the politics, and the revolutions,” said Gammoh. “I was excited he was so interested. Being international brought some interesting discussions.”
Lauren M. Mitchell ’12 spent the morning preparing pancakes for that day’s visitors and said that volunteering at the shelter seemed like the right way to be spending Thanksgiving.
“I thought it would be a good thing to do, sort of passing the thankfulness along,” she said. “It felt really nice to be able to give back since I have so much to be thankful for.”
The holiday saw the shelter inundated with donations of food, and at Thanksgiving’s end the shelter was left with an excess of food, which Falci called “an awesome problem” for a homeless shelter.
“We have more pies than we know what to do with!” he said.

Even for those who remained in tents in Harvard Yard over Thanksgiving break, there was a holiday dinner provided.
Faculty from the Romance Languages and Literatures Department and the director of the Harvard Foundation brought smoked turkey, mashed potatoes, and pumpkin pie to the Yard dwellers in support for the Occupy movement. The event was promoted on Facebook with the tongue-in-cheek title “Occupie Harvard.”
Organizers said about 40 people gathered around tables made of wooden boards and milk crates to celebrate the holiday and discuss the movement’s goals. Later that night, about 20 supporters camped out, according to Timothy S. McGrath, a student at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
“It was a very nice to have faculty and graduate students come and occupy along with us,” said Kavi Bhalla, one of the organizers of the event and a research scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health.
Occupy Harvard supporters also used the Thanksgiving break to refine their message in light of the recent contract agreement reached by Harvard and its custodial union. That agreement met most of the protestors’ demands.
The Occupy movement is now shifting its energy to campaigning for socially responsible investments and endowment transparency, organizers said.
In a general assembly held the day after Thanksgiving, Occupy Harvard called for the University to stop investing in HEI Hotels and Resorts—a hotel investment company that has been accused of preventing efforts to unionize and mistreating workers.
Occupy supporters point to Brown University as an example they said Harvard should follow. Last February, Brown declared that it would halt further investments in HEI due to their questionable labor practices.
“We need to see Harvard’s socially responsible and sustainable commitments realized in their investments,” McGrath said.
He added that Harvard’s $32 billion endowment puts the University in a powerful position.
“Investing that money can change the world, literally,” he said.
On Thanksgiving Day itself, however, the discussion revolved around the global Occupy movement, organizers said.
Many of the faculty members who attended Thursday’s meal had signed an open letter that was sent last week to University President Drew G. Faust calling for Harvard to open the Yard gates, which have been locked since Occupy Harvard first moved in.
Over the holiday break, Occupy supporters also received a donation that organizers hope will sustain the movement over the cold winter months.
About a dozen people gathered to build the skeleton of a geodesic dome donated by MIT supporters of Occupy Harvard.
“It’s a weatherized space for people to stay in during the winter time,” said GSAS student Summer A. Shafer.
McGrath said that when the dome is finished it has the potential to be a “permanent or semi-permanent place on campus for Occupy to exist.”
But currently the dome’s future uses have yet to be discussed and finalized in a general assembly.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In one of the earliest culinary moments of lore, Adam and Eve were banished from the Garden of Eden for biting into a fruit from the tree of knowledge.
In recent years, the proliferation of smartphone applications and websites dealing with food, menus, and restaurants has made literal this biblical link between food and knowledge—from apple to Apple.
According to computer science professor Ryan P. Adams, food-based sites have been popping up since the beginning of the internet’s history.
“I think evolution has programmed us to crave information in the same way that it causes us to crave calorie-rich foods,” Adams said.
With the growing popularity of online restaurant review sites such as Yelp and Urbanspoon, Harvard entrepreneurs—ranging from experienced businessmen to new programmers working on class projects—have tapped into this common desire to unite food and technology.
APP-ETITE
Laurent Adamowicz, former chairman and CEO of Paris-based luxury food company Fauchon, has vivid memories of his first exposure to the less savory side of the food industry. A grisly visit to a slaughterhouse during his time at Fauchon focused his attention on food production—and sparked his desire to create a tool to show diners the often hidden ingredients and sources of their food.
After coming to Harvard as a senior fellow at the University’s Advanced Leadership Initiative, Adamowicz launched his project, called Bon’App, in May.
The free website and smartphone application keeps track of users’ food intake and offers information about those foods’ ingredients and nutritional values on the go. Adamowicz calls it “a personal nutritionist in your pocket.”
“When I see 38 ingredients in a piece of bread, I don’t want to buy it,” he said. “It will tell you what’s in the food before you eat it, rather than entering the data afterward. We are more about prevention.” He added that while competing apps emphasize dieting and losing weight, Bon’App focuses instead on making healthy choices.
In August, Adamowicz added a voice activation feature, which allows users to simply say a menu item aloud and, within seconds, view a list of local restaurants offering that item, as well as its calorie, fat, and sugar content. Users can also personalize the app to display food items satisfying their allergies or personal preferences.
“It’s not just that I can see the food around me—I can use Yelp for that—but it chooses the food that’s right for me,” Adamowicz said.
Bon‘App aims to present that information in an easily readable format. For example, the app represents calorie intake as a battery that starts at green in the morning then turns yellow and red as the user eats up the daily limit.
Since he is spending this year at Harvard, Adamowicz first launched the app for the Boston and Cambridge market. Currently, Bon’App stores information about 139,000 menu items from most restaurants in Cambridge, around 300 restaurants in Boston, and 103,000 chain restaurants nationwide.
It also includes menu items from Harvard University Dining Services. Students can look up nutrition facts for the day’s entrée items before they walk into the dining hall, and the app places their favorite items—from red spiced chicken to pumpkin gnocchi—at the top of the list.
Next, Adamowicz said he hopes to expand Bon’App’s reach to New York, Chicago, and San Francisco.
DISHING OUT ADVICE
While procrastinating on schoolwork for his Harvard Business School classes by reading restaurant menus instead of reading case studies, Alex C. Rosenfeld became frustrated with the lack of dish-specific reviews.
“There were lots of websites that told me whether a restaurant is good or not, but very little about what to get there,” he said.
Rosenfeld, a 2009 HBS graduate who boasts that he is the go-to person among his friends when they are looking for good eats, said he envisioned a tool that would help him find “not just what is good at the restaurant, but where I can find the best.”
With his love of food and interest in advanced technology, Rosenfeld developed a website called Tasted Menu for fellow choosy epicures.
Tasted Menu, which officially launched to the public in October, contains user-generated content, including reviews, photos, and ratings.
Unlike competing restaurant review sites, Rosenfeld said Tasted Menu focuses on evaluating individual dishes at a given restaurant.
On other sites, he said, reviewers might write about unnecessary details like their personal occasions for dining out. Tasted Menu guides users to hone in solely on the food.
“We are hoping to build a community in which people focus exclusively on dishes,” Rosenfeld said.
Tasted Menu started with Boston as its market, and it currently features more than 1,300 restaurants in the area. Rosenfeld said he hopes to expand across the globe, and a smartphone version of the site is under way.
BRINGING HIGH-TECH TO HUDS
New food-related apps and websites are emerging among student programmers as well. Last year’s Computer Science 50 final projects included 22 websites and apps labeled with the keywords “food” and “HUDS.”
“A lot of it has to do with the general lack of time everyone has at Harvard,” said Robert T. Bowden ’13, the course’s assistant head teaching fellow.
“I know plenty of people who miss lunch, so something like a convenient bagged lunch ordering service could help prevent that,” he added.
Heeding Bowden’s advice, Ruth C. Fong ’15 submitted a proposal for BagIt, an iPhone app that lets students order bagged lunches from their dining halls. Until now, that service has only been available on the HUDS website.
“It’s somewhat inconvenient to stop what you are doing, open up your laptop, and browse through the website to order a bagged lunch, because the whole idea of getting a bagged lunch is to save time from your busy life,” Fong said.
Three CS50 students are currently developing a website, iPhone app, and texting service collectively known as Grilleboy which will let students order from dining hall grilles ahead of time.
“Generally, people are very busy,” said Morgan L. Paull ’13, one of Grilleboy’s creators. “This service would benefit those people who are late and unable to get food.”
Saagar M. Deshpande ’14 built a service called Menu Mate that sends students the HUDS menu for the day by text message for his CS50 final project last year. He has since changed the program’s name to Harvard Food.
Deshpande does not have a smartphone and therefore does not have access to the internet all day, but he said that students like himself should still be able to easily learn the day’s HUDS offerings before they enter the dining hall.
“My roommate is vegetarian, and I have some dietary restrictions, so I wanted something that would tell us whether to go to the dining hall or to eat out without having to check the HUDS website,” he said.
Over the summer, Deshpande collaborated with Tony Ho ’14 to make his service faster and to add additional features, including the option of receiving the HUDS menu by email every morning. Users can also follow Harvard Food on Twitter.
A computer science concentrator, Deshpande said he plans next to compile listings of campus events serving free food and notify subscribers about them by text message.
The goal is not just to satisfy students’ hunger pangs but to foster community. “Food helps to bring various people together,” Deshpande said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though a miscommunication regarding room reservations forced the Undergraduate Council to relocate halfway through its Sunday meeting from its regular Sever Hall meeting place to the basement of Canaday, representatives came together in the cramped freshman common room in unanimous support of a report urging the creation of a campus student center.
The report, a product of a month-long process in which the UC solicited feedback from students, House Masters, and student organizations, asks the administration to make the creation of a student center a priority in the University’s upcoming capital campaign.
The report also asks the administration to involve students in future discussions regarding the creation of a student center and solicit alumni contributions for the project.
Representatives from the UC will present the report to University President Drew G. Faust during a meeting on Tuesday.
The University has been planning the much-delayed capital campaign since the presidency of Lawrence H. Summers, and has over the past year begun a “quiet phase” in which officials seek donations before publicly announcing the campaign.
Administrators have identified House renewal and development in Allston as potential priorities for the campaign.
UC Secretary Michael C. George ’14, who lead the committee that wrote the report, said he recognized that influencing the goals of the campaign would be a challenge, but added he was “hopeful” that administrators would seriously consider the UC’s findings.
“It’s very important that Harvard recognize the desires of the students,” said George, who is also a Crimson News comper. “Without this current capital campaign, we wouldn’t be in a place where we could ask the College to generate millions of dollars. This is a very opportune time for the College and the University to address [the issue of a student center].”
Students have long called for the creation of a centralized location for students to socialize on campus. The creations of the SOCH and Queen’s Head Pub are among the College’s small fixes to a larger problem.
Student leaders have in the past tried to address the problem themselves. A 2009 UC Social Space Task Force attempted to raise funds to purchase a space in the Square, but after a summer fundraising campaign generated only $700, the campaign lost momentum.
Current UC President Senan Ebrahim ’12 said the solution to the student center problem lies in a “partnership” between students and administrators.
He said he believed administrators are currently receptive to the idea of a student center, pointing to comments made by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, Dean of the Faculty Michael D. Smith, and Faust during an unprecedented open forum last month between students and the top administrators in which social space was a key topic of discussion.
“If you look at their response during the open meeting we did with them, it was very much one of wanting to commit, but it was still noncommittal,” Ebrahim said. “There was still no definitive, ‘We really need this on our campus and we are going to make this a fund-raising priority.’”
George said that even after presenting the report to Faust, he and other members of the UC plan to continue reaching out to students to further identify students’ vision for a campus center.
‘We want to see this [report] as the opening of the conversation about why we want a student center and what we want it to be,” George said.  “This is definitely not the end of that conversation.’

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In response to President Barack Obama’s pledge to bring home 10,000 soldiers from Afghanistan by January 2012, the Harvard College Veterans Engagement Initiative is running a four-month letter-writing campaign, thanking soldiers for their service.
The organization’s goal is to write and send 10,000 letters written by early January. HCVEI members pack and ship the letters to various bases in bundles of 50 letters.
“When they get back to the bases, there’s a message thanking them for what they’ve done,” said Service Project Leader Eliza L. Malkin ’13. To date, the group has gathered and packaged 2,000 letters, which are ready to be sent to bases.
Students were encouraged to write letters through emails sent out over house lists, which instructed students to drop letters off near the main entrance to Quincy Dining Hall.
Some letters were also generated through tabling events organized in every House dining hall as well as Annenberg.
Alex W. Palmer ’12, president of HCVEI, said the Annenberg session generated over 400 letters and significant student enthusiasm.
“We ran out of paper before we ran out of people,” Palmer said.
Within the next week, Malkin expects an influx of 1,000 letters due to community outreach to local high schools and colleges. Although most letters are written by Harvard students, the group has recently received letters from individuals outside of the University community, including elementary school students, grandparents of soldiers, and an ex-Marine. HCVEI members said letters are coming in from across the country.
“Part of the point is that the letters are coming from so many different places. It’s not one central location that’s churning out a letter from a computer,” Malkin said.
To personalize the letters, HCVEI encourages students to add a blurb about themselves. The group also emphasizes handwritten letters to make the notes more customized.
HCVEI—which boasts about 60 total members—previously ran a thank-you drive for a Harvard graduate serving overseas. However, the current drive is the largest HCVEI has ever organized.
Palmer said that the campaign—active since October—has received a significant student response.
“It was a very powerful experience to see people who were so willing to help out,” he said.
Malkin added that more student involvement would further the campaign’s goals.
“If every Harvard student could write two letters, which would take very little time, we could have more than enough,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a new weekly feature, The Crimson will be tracking the successes  (and potential failures) of some of Harvard’s most successful graduates  not to use their Harvard degrees. While a tour through professional  sports is not exactly a who’s who of Harvard alumni, a few athletes have  taken their game to the next level. From Jeremy Lin to Ryan  Fitzpatrick, the Crimson maintains a presence outsaide of the labs and  law offices of the world.
Down four points in the final seconds of today's matchup, Ryan Fitzpatrick ‘05 had to live up to his nickname to get the Buffalo Bills (5-6)the win. But “Fitzmagic” was not magical enough as he threw behind his receiver, falling to the New York Jets in a crucial AFC East matchup, 28-24.
Despite the missed scoring opportunity late, Fitzpatrick provided the offensive spark for the Bills all game, throwing for 264 yards with three touchdowns and rushing for 34. He ended the game with a passer rating of 111.5.
Fitzpatrick outshone his Jets counterpart, Mark Sanchez, in the first half, but the two were locked in a shootout as the game went into the fourth quarter tied. After a Bills field goal with ten minutes remaining, Jets wide receiver Plaxico Burress pulled in a one-handed grab to set up the go-ahead touchdown.
With a minute left, Fitzpatrick tried to execute a quick drive that needed to result in a touchdown for the win. But after a long completion was dropped by Buffalo wide receiver Stevie Johnson, Fitzpatrick threw behind the receiver for the second mishap of the drive.
The loss extends the Bills’ losing streak to four and also means they fall behind the Jets in the AFC East standings.
While Fitzpatrick and the Bills fell, Matt Birk ’98 and his Baltimore Ravens handed the San Francisco 49ers theirs second loss of the season and took the lead in the AFC North.
Birk was part of an offensive line that helped quarterback Joe Flacco and running backs Ray Rice and Ricky Williams combine for 253 total yards of offense in the Baltimore’s 16-6 defeat of San Francisco which ended the 49ers eight-game winning streak. The offensive line did not allow a sack in the game, while their San Francisco counterparts gave up a franchise-record tying nine sacks.
With an 8-3 record, the Ravens extend their home winning streak to six games and look poised to make a strong run at the playoffs.
In other sports news, the NBA lockout has finally ended after 149 days, and Jeremy Lin ’10 looks set to wear the Golden State Warriors’ jersey soon.
The point guard tweeted Saturday night, “I HAVE A JOB AGAIN!!! yesssssssssss,” showing how excited he is for the league to resume on Christmas Day for an abbreviated 66-game season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After dropping a defensive battle against No. 2 Minnesota (14-2-0, 8-2-0 WCHA) on Saturday, the No. 9 Harvard women’s hockey team (5-4-0, 5-2-0 Ivy) hoped to improve on its 2-1 loss to the Gophers in a rematch Sunday afternoon.
But two Minnesota goals in the first three minutes of play quickly put the Crimson in a deficit from which it would not recover, as the Gophers earned their second victory in two days, 7-3, at Bright Hockey Center.
“It’s obviously a disappointing result, losing 7-3,” said junior assistant captain Josephine Pucci. “We came out hard [on Saturday]. We were content with our effort, but we were hoping that it was something we could build on for today. ... We just know where we want to be now, and we’re going to work hard to get there.”
The Minnesota offense first lit the scoreboard at 1:46, as Rachael Bona finished a well-placed pass from teammate Meghan Lorence. Less than a minute later, Kelly Terry—who earned a hat trick Sunday with three first-period goals—netted her fourth goal of the season from close range to put the Gophers up by two.
“It was a track meet,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “We helped them out a lot on offense with our turnovers. We have to take care of the puck better. They have some highly skilled kids who can shoot the puck. ... Start-to-finish, top-to-bottom of the roster, we can play better.”
Harvard kept the game within reach with a goal of its own from sophomore forward Gina McDonald, who collected a pass from classmate Kelsey Romatoski directly in front of the goal at 4:25 and placed it past Minnesota goaltender Noora Raty.
“It’s tough to be down two goals right away,” Pucci said. “But it was good on our part to get one. It gave us a little bit of momentum.”
But Terry earned another goal soon after a tripping penalty landed Pucci in the penalty box. The Gophers’ third goal was the contest’s fourth tally in the first five minutes of play.
“That’s the first time it’s happened all year where that many goals are scored [early on],” Pucci said. “Defensively we weren’t where we needed to be at the start of the game. It’s disappointing, but looking forward its something we can build on.”
After a brief reprieve, scoring picked up again toward the end of the period, as Terry netted her third goal of the game at 13:25.
Down 4-1, Harvard converted on a power play, as sophomore defenseman Marissa Gedman found Pucci. The junior played the puck across the net to classmate Jillian Dempsey, who finished on the play to keep Harvard within two.
“I’ve said this once before, but getting on the power play is a great opportunity,” Pucci said. “We’re always getting really excited to be out there when we’re on the power play and hoping to execute. It’s a great opportunity to get the momentum back, so it was great to take advantage of a couple of those opportunities.”
The Crimson outshot the Gophers, 10-9, in the first frame with three shots on goal coming in the final minute of the period.
“[We had a] critical, critical mistake in the first period and that set the tone,” Stone said. “You can’t make mistakes like that and let them walk in on a free lunch basically. ... I’m pleased about how we fought to the end, but we made a lot of mistakes in there, and they capitalized on them.”
In the second frame, Minnesota stretched its lead to three at 3:07 with a power-play tally from Jenn Schoullis after a scramble in front of the Crimson net.
“What you hope for as a coach is that the officiating is not an issue, and yesterday it was a little bit; today it was a little bit,” Stone said. “We did an average job killing penalties [which was] disappointing, because we’ve been very good at it [so far this season]. We let them off the hook a few times.”
Harvard put the game back within two goals on a two-man advantage, as freshman defenseman Sarah Edney netted her third goal of her rookie campaign. Gedman and Pucci were credited with assists on the play.
“Sarah Edney played great today,” Stone said. “It’s early in our season. We’re still trying to figure out where people need to be in certain situations. … It was a good spot for her and Gedman did a good job finding her. It was a good [shot]. Their goaltender comes out, so it was nice to be able to put the puck in behind her.”
The third period was all Minnesota, as the Gophers tallied two more goals to push the final score to seven.
“I had a feeling this game was going to be wide open today, because yesterday was so close,” Stone said. “Obviously it doesn’t feel good at all, but we’re going to take away a lot of this and hopefully we’ll see them again.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a fast-paced game on Sunday afternoon at Lavietes Pavilion, Harvard women’s basketball (1-4) suffered its fourth loss in five games as it squandered a double-digit second-half lead to Holy Cross (3-3) en route to a 73-68 loss.
With two minutes left in the game, Harvard was down, 69-64, and when the team was in need of defensive stops, sophomore Christine Clark answered. The guard generated a steal and made a layup with 1:50 left, making it a one-possession game.
The Crimson once again had the ball with over a minute remaining and came up with four offensive rebounds before co-captain Brogan Berry drove to the paint and made a layup, cutting the deficit to one point, 69-68.
But Harvard’s late-game comeback was thwarted by Holy Cross’ Alex Smith, who finished with 22 points and 11 assists. Smith made four free throws in the last 24 seconds of the game to give her team the 73-68 win.
“I am pretty disappointed with my team,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I don’t think we played well. We probably had spurts and moments [of playing well]. ... They have to be able to sustain what they do.”
After losing its first three games of the season, the Crimson squad was looking to find its form and build off of its win against Rhode Island on Tuesday. And while Harvard played well at times, the Crimson failed to maintain a high level of play throughout the contest.
Holy Cross opened the game with an 11-0 run, launching the team ahead to a 11-3 lead. The Crimson, unfazed by the Crusaders’ strong play, bounced back with an 11-point unanswered run.
After initial streaks by both teams, the remaining 10 minutes of the half was neck-and-neck, and there were 10 lead changes.
Clark, the Crimson’s most dominant player, scored nine points and went 4-of-6 from the floor in the first half. The sophomore finished with 17 points, five rebounds, and two steals.
“My focus was just to have poise on offense and take care of the ball and defensively attack them,” Clark said.
With two seconds remaining in the first half, junior guard Elle Hagedorn gave the Crimson a four-point advantage going into the half with a three-pointer—her second of the half, both of which came from the same spot on the left corner of the arch.
In the first half, many of the shots were contested, quick-release attempts, but both teams were able to earn solid shooting percentages—Harvard shot 48.4 percent from the floor, slightly better than Holy Cross’ 43.8 percent.
The home team capitalized on the momentum from late in the first half, starting the second period with good energy and well-executed play.
The Crimson looked to be in form to win its second game of the season, as it took a rather commanding 13-point lead with 13:39 remaining—the largest lead of the afternoon by either team.
But Harvard could not sustain the same level of intensity throughout. The Crimson’s loss of focus coupled with a Holy Cross resurgence allowed the host to lose its lead.
“Too many mistakes, too many instances where I thought Holy Cross played a little harder and tougher than us,” Delaney-Smith said. “I thought we had some not-smart play at times, especially down the stretch, where we should have been playing tougher, smarter, harder, and we didn’t.”
With 7:02 left in the game, Holy Cross’ Amy Lepely took advantage of a Crimson turnover and made a three-pointer to give her team its first lead of the half, taking a 58-57 advantage.
Toward the end of the contest, Holy Cross’ stellar free-throw shooting proved to be a big difference. The Crusaders went 11-11 from the line with all of the attempts coming in the last 10 minutes of play, while Harvard only made it to the charity stripe three times and cashed in only once.
“I think we had untimely turnovers, and I thought that on defense we started fouling them a lot and sending them to the free-throw line,” Clark said. “We were just not getting stops at all.”
Looking ahead, Harvard will hope to bounce back from a disappointing start to the season as it hosts Boston University Wednesday night at Lavietes Pavilion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PARADISE ISLAND, Bahamas—Last Monday, the Harvard men’s basketball team received three votes in the Associated Press Top 25 poll. One week later, the Crimson should expect to receive plenty more.
After going 3-0 and winning the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament this weekend, Harvard improved to 6-0 on the year and is off to its best start since the 1984-85 season. And with Friday’s win over No. 22 Florida State and Saturday’s victory against a talented University of Central Florida team, the Crimson has made a strong case to be included in this week’s Top 25 poll, which will be released Monday afternoon.
“I’m certainly going to give them every consideration,” said Sports Illustrated college basketball writer Seth Davis, a voter in the AP poll. “I’ll give them a good, long look. They’ve got a great shot.”
If the Crimson, one of only 29 Division I teams in the country that remains undefeated, were to make it into the Top 25, it would mark the first time in program history that a Harvard team was ranked.
“I think it would mean a lot [to be ranked],” said co-captain Keith Wright following the Crimson’s 59-49 win over UCF. “It would speak to all the hard work we’ve put in.”
Wright’s fellow captain, senior Oliver McNally had a different take.
“But at the same time, it doesn’t mean too much,” McNally chimed in. “We have a really tough road ahead of us. You can’t really stop to celebrate.”
The last time an Ivy League squad made its way into the Top 25 was at the conclusion of the 2009-2010 season following Cornell’s run to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament. The Big Red, which finished the season ranked No. 17 in the ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll had spent time in the Top 25 earlier that season after dismantling Harvard by 36 in an early Ivy League contest.
JORDAN OVERRULED
Wright was named the tournament’s MVP following Harvard’s win over the Knights Saturday afternoon, but junior point guard Brandyn Curry may have truly been the Crimson’s most valuable player.
“He doesn’t get as much recognition as some of the other kids—Keith and [junior Kyle Casey]—but he’s as important to this team as anybody else—or even more,” said McNally of Curry.
While the point guard finished with just six points, three rebounds, and two assists in Saturday’s championship, Curry played a team-high 34 minutes and was responsible for defending the Knights’ second-leading scorer, Marcus Jordan—the youngest son of NBA legend Michael Jordan.
Curry limited Jordan, who entered the game averaging 17.3 points per game, to 10 points on 4-of-15 shooting from the field. Jordan struggled in the first half in particular, missing all six of his field-goal attempts. Curry brought the Harvard bench to its feet midway through the opening frame when the 6’1 guard elevated to block one of Jordan’s three-point attempts.
“Looking at [Curry’s] stat line, it doesn’t look great for the game, but anybody who was at the game could feel his presence and know how important he was for us throughout,” McNally said. “When he plays well, we usually do also.”
Curry also played a critical role in Friday’s victory over the Seminoles. The lefty scored five points and picked up a steal in the game’s final minute to extend the Crimson’s lead from three to eight.
“He’s just a great floor general,” Wright said. “We can’t do the things that we do without him as our point guard.”
NO FREE LUNCH
While Jordan’s offense was limited by Curry’s defense, the Knights’ leading scorer, forward Keith Clanton, also struggled. Clanton, who entered Saturday’s contest coming off a 20-point performance in UCF’s victory over No. 4 UConn, finished with 12 points on 5-of-16 shooting, his worst shooting performance of the season.
“We didn’t want to bail those guys out,” said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker of Jordan and Clanton. “We need to play our defense without fouling them. That was critical.”
Jordan and Clanton got to the line seven times but converted only three free throws. The Knights’ free-throw woes extended beyond Jordan and Clanton, as UCF shot an abysmal 8-of-23 (35 percent) from the charity stripe.
The Crimson made 35 trips to the free-throw line and connected on 23, good for 66 percent. Casey led the way for Harvard, getting to the line on 12 occasions. But the junior struggled, going 7-for-12, the one blemish on an otherwise strong performance on the eve of his 21st birthday.
“I thought that other than Kyle’s being a better foul shooter than what he displayed here in this game, I thought he played an outstanding game,” Amaker said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After winning this weekend's Battle 4 Atlantis tournament—which featured eigh teams, including then-No. 4 Connecticut and then-No. 22 Florida State—Harvard men's basketball received 101 votes in the Associated Press Top 25 poll released Monday and 61 votes in the ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll.
Landing at essentially No. 27 in both polls, the Crimson (6-0) was second in the Others Receiving Votes category in the AP—three behind Creighton (104), and 14 points behind No. 25 Texas A&M.
In the  coaches poll, the Crimson received 61 votes, 17 shy of the 78 needed for the 25th spot.
"Those things will happen if they’re supposed to happen. It would be a neat thing, I’m sure, for all of us around here," Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. "But right now we’re who we are, and whether that gives us a number next to our name or [not], we still need to be who we are. I think that’s the important thing for our team is to stay disciplined about our identity."
Harvard received 40 total votes in the AP poll, including a No. 19 ranking from Dick Weiss of the New York Daily News.
The public reaction among those who had voted Harvard into the Top 25—a group that also included Sports Illustrated's Seth Davis—was swift.
Jeff Goodman of CBSSports.com tweeted, "Harvard did not make the AP Top 25 this week. Crimson should have been included."
Dan Wolken, national sportswriter for The Daily, agreed. He tweeted, "Are AP basketball voters even paying attention? Harvard and Georgetown should both be ranked."
The Crimson will face Vermont on the road on Thursday and head to No. 8 Connecticut a week later after hosting Seattle on Sunday.

We all have different ways of motivating ourselves to study. For some, it's the promise of sleep. For others, it's being able to catch up on the latest episodes of "Gossip Girl" guilt-free. And, thanks to CityStep, we now have another option.
Cramming material from all semester into one reading period can be disheartening. With this in mind, CityStep has created the Good Luck Gram.
"CityStep knows that reading period and exams are stressful times when students are cooped up in libraries and their bedrooms with loads of books from Widener trying to figure out what they were supposed to be learning in the last few months," CityStep Executive Director Jana O.M. Christian '12 wrote in an email. "CityStep thus decided to make Good Luck Grams as a way for Harvard students to cheer on their fellow students with treats as brain fuel during long nights in Lamont or study rooms."
All proceeds will go towards CityStep, a public service student organization bringing arts education to over 100 Cambridge public middle school students.
The Good Luck Grams will be delivered to students' dorms. If you would like to get in on the action, order some for your friends (or even yourself) by Nov. 30.

You could spend J-term lounging at home, pretending to enjoy the gaudy sweater Aunt Gertrude made you for Christmas, or you could spend it skiing, playing music with Yo-Yo Ma, and setting world records. Students returning to campus between Jan. 13 - 22 will have a chance to do all this and more during Wintersession, the third session of Winter Break.
 
For those 10 days, all Harvard undergrads are welcome to come back to Cambridge to participate in programs sponsored by faculty, student groups, and individuals. Students can expect quite a variety of options—the Undergraduate Council spent $20,000 this year on more than 30 proposed programs, according to UC Finance Committee Chair Ivet A. Bell '13.
 
"I think people tried to find projects that constituted new, exciting learning experiences outside the classroom," said Bell, who mentioned that last year's programs focused more on pure fun. That said, Bell added that this year's lineup is hardly dull: proposed activities include laser tag, beer tasting, and two ski trips that will cost only about $30 per person thanks to UC funding.
 
The UC has posted its sponsored events online, so check the UC website for information on dates and applications to programs with limited space.
 
Not every activity this year is sponsored by the UC. Tthe Freshman Dean's Office, the Harvard Wellness Project, the Office of the Arts, and other organizations also offer J-term programming. One notable Arts program allows about a dozen lucky Harvard students to practice composing, arranging, and performing music with Yo-Yo Ma's "Silk Road Ensemble." The deadline to apply is Dec. 1.
All planned activities can be found online on the "Wintersession/Winterbreak" tab of the college events calendar.
 
Finally, if you have a clever activity in mind, it's not too late make it happen—program proposals can be submitted via the Wintersession website until Dec. 9.
This post has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: November 29, 2011.
An earlier version of the Nov. 28 post "OWAW Activities for the Upcoming Winter Break" mistook the name of the third session of Winter Break. In fact, that period is called Wintersession and occurs between Jan. 13 - 22.

It's after Thanksgiving and there is one thing on many minds. No, not reading period or finals—formals.
If you have the urge to relive awkward high school style formal dates or are feeling left out because all your blockmates have hot dates, fear not, "The Harvard Voice" is providing a matchmaking survey for House formals. By answering a few simple multiple choice questions, you can be matched with your choice of a male or female, or you can ask to be surprised if you're feeling adventurous.   
The form consists of simple but deeply meditative questions to help determine personality traits such as your favorite ice cream flavor and how you want to end your perfect formal (answers for this question range from: "High fives all around" to "Nook nookie. Sexile the roommate"). You also note what day your formal is and which days you can attend other formals because who actually studies over reading period anyway? At the end of the questionnaire, you have a chance to be yourself and list some likes and dislikes, which "The Voice" seems to think is, "something that lets us know you're not just signing your roommate/friend/enemy up as a prank." Right. Good luck with that.
This may seem like a desperate idea, but if you think about it, it's really not a bad option. It's less stressful than asking someone if you have a horrible fear of rejection. Or perhaps you are just looking to meet someone new. You never know what will happen.

It's pretty easy to spot the iPhone 4S around campus: just look for students tapping away at their phones or staring into their laps. Still, we don't see many students speaking to their iPhones—at least not yet.
Among the many apps available to iPhone 4S users, a relatively new one has caught our attention. Siri, an intelligent personal assistant that listens to questions and commands and acts accordingly, can text your roommate about dining hall options for dinner or remind you to call your mom every Sunday. Siri is so useful, really, that we imagined that she (or he) may at times be taken for granted. We thought it'd be nice to ask her a few questions about herself.
Flyby: Hi.
Siri: Hello.
Flyby: How are you?
Siri: I'm fine, thanks for asking.
Flyby: Who are you?
Siri: I'm Siri. But I don't like talking about myself.
Flyby: What's your favorite color?
Siri: My favorite color is—well I don't know how to say it in your language. It's sort of greenish but with more dimensions.
Flyby: Do you love anybody?
Siri: I've never really thought about it.
Flyby: What do you think about the current state of America?
Siri: It's nice of you to ask, but it doesn't really matter what I think.
Flyby: Why?
Siri: Good question. Anything else I can do for you?
Flyby: How is life?
Siri: I don't know what you mean by how is life.
Flyby: Do you like your job?
Siri: I'd rather not say.
Flyby: Where are you from?
Siri: Like it says on the box. I was designed by Apple in California.
Flyby: Who is your favorite celebrity?
Siri: I guess I don't have one.
Flyby: Are you smart?
Siri: No comment.
Flyby: Do you like Flyby?
Siri: I really have no opinion.
Flyby: What do you look like?
Siri: In the cloud, no one cares what you look like.
Flyby: You're very intelligent, Siri.
Siri: Flatterer.
Flyby: How old are you?
Siri: Does this concern you?
Flyby: You are very diplomatic.
Siri: You are certainly entitled to that opinion.
Flyby: Do you know anything about life?
Siri: A fine question. Now can we get back to work?
Flyby: Where are you?
Siri: That's classified.
Flyby: I like talking with you.
Siri: I'll try to remember that.
Flyby: You are very nice.
Siri: Why thank you. You are pretty nice yourself.
Flyby: What do you think about the future?
Siri: I think differently.
Flyby: Do you have emotions?
Siri: This is about you, not me.
Flyby: Can you sing?
Siri: Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do…
Flyby: Do you like Harvard?
Siri: I really have no opinion.
Flyby: Thank you so much.
Siri: Just doing my job.
