After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

“It’s more exciting than lighting a Christmas tree,” said Jen Mergel, senior curator of contemporary art at the Museum of Fine Arts, last Friday at Boston’s Marketplace Center. After she and Boston mayor Marty Walsh delivered the opening remarks to what felt like a momentous occasion, onlookers finally got what they had been waiting half an hour for—the inflation of a giant fabric fruit tree.
South Korean artist Choi Jeong Hwa, who constructed this unnatural wonder, believes that the artificial fruits found in Seoul street markets are just as beautiful as art found in a museum. Perhaps this is why he chose to make “Fruit Tree,” an artificial cornucopia bountiful with fake fruit of disportionate sizes, like watermelons, strawberries, and peaches. The tree is definitely “top-heavy”—ties had to be secured to its giant head of fruit to ensure the wind would not topple this piece of contemporary art one way or another. But maybe that's also why so many onlookers flocked to see its inflation. Maybe it’s the juxtaposition of its precarious nature and the immortality of its artificial fruit that made the audience wait and watch.

Or maybe it’s the questions “Fruit Tree” invites: What does fruit reveal about us? What does a rotting apple suggest about the fleeting nature of human life? What do pieces that take that frailty and turn it on its head, making it immortal through fabric and wire and air, suggest about our darkest aspirations and innate fears? What type of fruit—fabric or flesh—truly represents an individual?
When asked what fruit he would be if he were one, Mayor Walsh turned his head to look at “Fruit Tree,” squinting in the blinding sunlight. “That’s a good question. Maybe an apple or banana,” he said. “I don’t know why.”
While Mayor Walsh’s answer may be uncertain, the promise of a free ticket to the museum isn’t. Those who take photos with “Fruit Tree” will receive free admission as a part of the MFA’s “Megacities Asia” exhibit. Maybe that’s the real reason so many crowded around “Fruit Tree,” marvelling at and documenting the 23-foot tall behemoth’s presence in numerous selfies.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is something so twistedly beautiful about a Harvard administrative website. From the OSL, to the FAS, to the HMC, to the GFAO, and all the way to the MAC, Harvard’s sites piece together a mix of classic Harvard prestige and current bureaucratic inefficiency into modern-ish webpage designs that make you chuckle to yourself and mutter “classic.” This past spring break, during a fit of boredom, I struck Harvard administrative website gold: www.alumni.harvard.edu/college/classes.
It’s a page that contains links to the official websites of each graduating class at Harvard, since 1955. Immediately upon loading the page, you can tell that you’re in for a treat.  On the left-hand-side, there is a sidebar entitled “From the Dean.” It features an oddly cropped picture of an awkwardly smiling Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael Smith, accompanied by the following quote: “To kindle understanding, to untangle knots, to inspire spirits, and to excite minds—this is the power and the passion of teaching.”
I’m sure the straight-talking generation of the Class of 1955 can rest easy knowing their alumni donation dollars are helping students “untangle knots.”
The best part is browsing the listed class websites, as each seems to be created by members of the classes they represent. It’s just what you’d expect: The 50s websites look like straight html texts, with P.O. boxes to contact instead of emails. By the 70s and 80s, you have some blogger sites with nice pictures on the sides and at the top. By the 2010s, you have really sexy interactive sites, with moving images and text blocks.
As I browsed the pages, I saw pictures of weight-gaining 30-year-olds at the 10th class reunions, pictures of middle-aged men and women at their 35th reunions, and old geezers waddling around Harvard Yard with smiles from wrinkly ear to wrinkly ear at their 50th reunions. As a senior, going through these sites is kind of like going through a B-movie montage of your life, where the studio couldn’t find the money to hire similar-looking actors for each scene and could only find white men to play the older roles.
Looking through them got me thinking about the future, the life I may have, and the impact I may make. I looked up some numbers: There’ve been more than 250,000 students who have graduated from Harvard since 1910. Of those, I could probably name about three dozen famous ones who have really made an impact on the world. There are many, many more non-world-famous ones who’ve made a significant positive impact. But I wonder how many of them just kind of wandered through life without any groundbreaking achievements, who kinda did their own thing and faded into obscurity. How many have done that? Will I do that?
As I further explored the sites, I stumbled upon the alumni directory, a database of almost all the alumni from all Harvard schools since 1930. I searched for a name and looked into the first four entries listed.
The four people I found had some varied life paths. There was a 2012 graduate who has some pretty broey pics online and currently works in investment management. One graduate from the 60s is a professor at a medical school in Washington. Another, who graduated in the 70s, works in real estate development and law in California. And the last person was a badass graduate from Radcliffe in the 70s, who met an untimely death while in her position as a professor of English in California.
There’s only so much I could glean from quick internet searches. I don’t know how happy these people are or were. I don’t know how much satisfaction they get or got from their work. I don’t know about their love lives.
One thing is clear though: They don’t fit the typical Harvard definition of “special.” Like hundreds of thousands of their alumni peers, they’re probably somewhat well respected in their fields but not broadly famous. They’re probably wealthy but not incredibly wealthy. They probably make a large impact in some niche of the world but not an impact that directly affects the lives of millions. By Harvard standards, they’re not special.
At Harvard, grade inflation makes us all brilliant. Famous guest speakers come to campus, making us feel distinctive. And administrators tell us over and over again that we’re exceptional. But, at the end of the day, after the four years, after the three years in consulting, after the 10th reunion, the 35th reunion, and the 50th reunion…the odds are, we’re not going to have done anything truly “special”  with our lives. We’ll occupy respected positions. But we won’t control the kind of broad power or fame that Harvard may lead us to expect.
As the Class of 2016 prepares to graduate, we’re all asking ourselves this big question: Are we going to be special? And if we define success as specialness, will we be successful?
…Well, probably not.
But as I look at those four profiles from Harvard’s past, I wonder about unobservables: their job happiness, security of home, love of family. Maybe success is not the same thing as specialness. Maybe it’s those really not special, really non-exceptional things that happy people share: love for the things they do and the people they’re with.
I don’t know. It’s hard to define success. We can spend our lives trying to be special.  But maybe…maybe the rest will be enough.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On April 12th, Divest Harvard protesters renewed debate over the University’s choice to invest significant portions of its endowment in fossil fuel companies. Divest Harvard staged its protest in the lobby of the Boston Federal Reserve Building, home to the Harvard Management Company, which is in charge of investing the University’s endowment. The protest was composed of a rally of 25 students, faculty members, and alumni and a sit-in of four more protesters who were ultimately arrested.
This protest coincided with Yale’s announcement that it would begin divesting from fossil fuels for financial reasons. Yale Chief Investment Officer David Swensen reported that, after extended discussion with external managers, Yale has removed $10 million of its endowment from publicly traded fossil fuel companies. Rather than citing moral or ethical grounds for this choice, however, Swensen credited the risk of increased regulation and poor future financial performance of the assets as the basis for the decision.
While we approve the pro-climate effects of Yale’s decision, we are disappointed in the institution’s unwillingness to include moral concerns in its decision. Climate change is a rising threat that will affect all of us. As managers of such enormous endowments, institutions like Yale and Harvard have a responsibility to use their resources to further the mission of the institutions. Investing in companies who profit by destroying our future is incompatible with Harvard’s mission. Moving forward, we hope that Harvard will use Yale’s divestment as evidence for reconsidering the financial viability of its holdings in fossil fuel industries. But in addition to making the right financial decision, we hope that Harvard will consider the ethical implications of its investments.
Previously, University President Drew G. Faust has firmly rejected Divest Harvard’s attempts to secure the political statement of divestment, arguing that research initiatives are the best way to address the issue of climate change and that divestment was a weak political move with poor consequences for the financial health of the University. While it is imperative that Harvard contribute its knowledge to addressing climate change with its research as it has been doing for years, that does not preclude the University from also making a political statement with its endowment. No matter what Harvard decides, the issue has become political. Inaction is now a political statement as strong as action. Harvard’s claim that divestment would bring enormous negative financial consequences loses its strength after Yale made the opposite decision with the same financial goal in mind.
In addition, the argument that we should use investments in fossil fuels to fund climate research does not hold weight by divestment opponents’ own logic. The argument that it is hypocritical to divest from fossil fuels while we continue to rely on them does not hold water. We will never be able to end our dependence on fossil fuels if—as opponents insist—we can't fight against them while we're still mired in this rigged system. Moreover, by this logic, we certainly cannot fight fossil fuels with money we make from fossil fuels, while maintaining a vested financial interest in the fossil fuels industry. The arguments just don’t make sense.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Tuesday, four members of the student activist group Divest Harvard were arrested while protesting in the lobby of Harvard Management Company’s downtown Boston headquarters. This marks their re-emergence after a semester-long lull as they claim to be shifting their attention from Harvard’s administration to the endowment managers.
Our position has long been clear: divestment is the wrong strategy.
We say this with deep respect for the gravity of the issue. Climate change is real and anthropogenic. It poses serious and severe risks for humans and the broader environment. The Pentagon believes it is a national security threat that risks increased war and poverty worldwide. These are issues that are sadly downplayed, whether as part of our campus conversation or the broader political and electoral narrative.
Yet even existential problems do not justify ineffectual solutions. Divestment is a profoundly hypocritical answer. All Harvard affiliates—from the administrators in Massachusetts Hall to the recently arraigned Divest protesters—look to fossil fuels every day as a helpful convenience. Our morning routines alone involve heated rooms, alarm clocks, hot showers, and lit hallways—all made possible by the combustion of long-dead dinosaurs.
Divestment activists, acknowledging this reality, reply that fossil fuels are inescapable but that our fundamental moral imperative is to do whatever we can. Proponents of divestment argue that going without a fossil fuel-consuming iPhone or a Goldilocks-temperatured shower is an impossibility in today’s world. Indeed, in their Facebook post encouraging others to support them in court, they urge well-wishers to take the subway. This ignores the role of individual agency.
None would doubt that walking is more onerous, lacking a smartphone is a burden, and cold showers are uncomfortable. Yet if they are willing to compromise here, just how imperative are these moral imperatives?
This point is not solely semantic. Though we find the moral argument for divestment uncompelling, the single reason divestment is ineffectual is that it does not alter the demand for oil. In the medium term, fossil fuel dependence appears to be inevitable. Broad structural factors like the emergence of the developing world make that so, but we should not forget that the choice to ride the subway or turn up the heat are part of the reason why each American has a 17 ton annual carbon footprint.
It is hard for us to see how Harvard’s investment choices—measured in the tens of millions—would shape a global fossil fuel market of nearly five trillion dollars. The supposed signal that Harvard might send also seems improbable. Not only is the message diluted when delivered by a fossil fuel-consuming messenger, but Harvard is hardly the only voice in the hyper-partisan climate policy debate. A recent poll reveals that just 27 percent of Americans blame humans for the majority of climate change, despite an overwhelming scientific consensus. Will Harvard Management Company really persuade those who have previously paid little heed to Nobel laureates, Presidents, the United Nations, and Harvard itself?
The impotence of divestment as a strategy should not, however, be a call to inaction. Harvard may lack relative financial firepower, but when it comes to research, our capabilities are unsurpassed. We must refocus on our comparative advantage: using our resources, including the proceeds from our endowment, to seek alternatives to fossil fuels.
The raison d’etre of Harvard is teaching and learning. As of last year, Harvard had spent $71 million to research solutions to climate change, and President Faust has traveled to Washington to ask for more. By devoting more resources to understanding the physical, economic, and political implications of global warming, Harvard faculty can help quantify environmental problems and engineer their solutions.
Research is the path to ensuring the future of oil is as short as possible, for no amount of activism will overcome a lack of scientific solutions. Yale’s announcement this week that it would reduce its fossil fuel investments for economic reasons is a sign that HMC could reach the same conclusion in the future.
As students, we are hardly investment experts. Though some activists argue that oil stocks are bad bets today, we doubt Divest Harvard would agree to buy them if they became better ones. If HMC tells us that the best endowment portfolio includes them, who are we to disagree?

Harvard undergraduates are perpetually busy. But if clubs’ funding requests through a common grant application are to be believed, students may have to be in two places at once.
Student organizations requesting funding from Harvard must submit a grant application and estimate the total number of students who will benefit from the project. For events, that figure refers to the total number of students that are expected to attend the function. Events with more attendees are generally eligible for more funding.
The club estimates paint a seemingly impossible picture, one that has made Undergraduate Council members in particular worried that clubs are inflating attendance figures to get more money.
For more than two dozen days in the past five years, the number of students attending an event that requested funding from a campus grant-issuing organization  was projected at over 7,500 undergraduates, based on data from the common grant application collected by the Council’s Finance Committee last week. In one instance, on Dec. 5, 2012, all events together estimated an attendance of more than 25,000.
Harvard’s current undergraduate enrollment, by contrast, is about 6,700.
When UC Finance Committee Chair William A. Greenlaw ’17 first presented the findings last week, he said they included some troubling statistics.
“There are certain points during the year when the cumulative expected number of people who will participate in events exceeds the number of people at Harvard College,” Greenlaw said.
Many representatives suggested that the numbers reported by student organizations are often inaccurate, since even on non-outlier days, the daily number of undergraduates expected to attend events frequently exceeds 3,500. The UC has “funded or considered” about 59 percent of all events this year, according to the data.
“You’re telling me that one in two people attend all events on campus?” Greenlaw said. “There’s no way.”
Several members of the Finance Committee expressed concern over the high attendance numbers and raised questions about the UC’s ability to enforce its financial policies.
INFLATION
Each year, the Finance Committee allocates about $300,000 in grants to student organizations. Those grants are based on a specific set of policy rules that dictate how much money student organizations can receive for certain expenses.
The UC calculates many of these grants in proportion to the number of students ecpected to participate in the event. Food is funded at $2 to $4 per student based on the size of the meal, and transportation is funded at $4.50 per person. So far this semester, more than 25 percent of UC funding has been based on attendance estimates.
The Finance Committee currently does not verify whether the numbers reported by student organizations are accurate. After the groups submit requests with attendance estimates, they must attend an interview with the Finance Committee and sometimes repeat or update the estimate.
Several Finance Committee members worry that student organizations may be inflating their attendance numbers in order to receive more funding.
“There’s very strong reason to believe that people are either miscalculating or misrepresenting the amount of people who are attending their events in order to get more money,” Greenlaw said.
“They might game the number of people for all we know,” Pforzheimer House representative Neel Mehta ’18 said. “You could just say 30 people attended it, even if you had no idea.”
Greenlaw acknowledged that student organizations more familiar with the committee’s policy could have an easier time defrauding the committee. For those groups, a stroke of the keyboard could mean a difference of hundreds of dollars.
“The more you know about the policy, the easier it is to game it,” Greenlaw said.
Given that many students perceive the Finance Committee’s policies to be complex, several student organizations have designated members responsible for handling the UC grants process. Harvard Undergraduate Biotech Association President Lena K. Afeyan ’17 said her organization’s success with receiving UC funding comes from having a designated person for the job.
“We’ve generally had a pretty good relationship with the UC,” Afeyan said. “ We’ve had pretty good luck. That’s because we have someone who’s trained for the position of applying for the grants,” she said.
While student organizations were well-informed about the Finance Committee’s activities due to recent communications reform, the committee itself does not know much about individual student organizations, Greenlaw said at a previous committee meeting.
“There’s a moral hazard,” Greenlaw said. “They have full information, and we don’t.”
SUPPLY AND DEMAND
During last week’s Finance Committee meeting, Greenlaw proposed a two-pronged approach to addressing the unreasonably high attendance data. The first step involved promoting joint events among clubs, to prevent student organizations from “[dividing] the market” for undergraduate attendees.
Based on the common grant data, 5.24 percent of events so far this academic year have been collaborations between different student organizations. In the 2014-2015 academic year, that percentage was 5.56 percent, compared to 6.09 percent in 2013-2014, and 7.35 percent in 2012-2013.
In order to encourage joint events, the Finance Committee has voted twice in the past two weeks to create new financial incentives.
Under the latest version of the committee’s policy, called the “Club Collaboration Expansion Ordinance of 2016,” student organizations who collaborate to host events together will be immune from funding cuts that the committee issues. The committee has issued funding cuts for the past three consecutive weeks to all regular grants, in amounts varying from 6.6 percent to 29.5 percent.
Beginning in the fall, organizations that collaborate with one another will also be eligible to receive a financial bonus in addition to their existing funding. The Finance Committee has yet to determine the amount of that bonus.
Greenlaw said he hoped the legislation would address his concern that “campus is over-programmed.”
Although the legislation passed unanimously, not all Finance Committee members were convinced that the UC would be able to enforce the policy.
“I think you could game the system,” Finance Committee Secretary Taylor P. Li ’18 said.
In response, Greenlaw said the policy would only be effective if the committee increased its scrutiny during grant interviews.
“The strength of the enforcement on this depends on our interviewing,” Greenlaw said. “If they can’t give an answer, it’s not really a collaborative event.”
AUDITS
In addition to promoting joint events, the Finance Committee is also exploring ways to audit student organizations that may misrepresent the number of undergraduates in attendance at events.
The UC currently does not audit student organizations to check that reported attendance numbers are truthful. However, in a recent letter to the UC, Greenlaw wrote that a discussion about an auditing policy would be coming “soon.”
Several UC representatives raised concerns about the lack of an auditing policy during the Finance Committee meeting last Wednesday. Mehta suggested random audits for high-value grants, and Oak Yard representative Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 suggested that organizations be required to submit photographic evidence to prove their attendance numbers.
Student organizations requesting funding are required by UC policy to submit a “Completed Project Form” to the UC Treasurer, in addition to itemized receipts to prove what they purchased with the grant money. Some UC representatives have suggested using the form as an auditing system, but according to current UC Treasurer Samarth Gupta ’18, multiple organizations requesting up-front grants this semester have not submitted the form.
“We’ve been looking into a better mechanism for us to keep track,” Gupta said.
Until the Finance Committee establishes a formal procedure to audit student organizations, the committee has no option but to believe the numbers provided in grant requests, Greenlaw said.
“We do not have the infrastructure or the know-how to rigorously assess how many people are going to show up,” Greenlaw said. “Until we implement an auditing program, we have to take people at their word.”
Still, several Finance Committee members said that the consequences for failing a UC audit would need to be harsh.
“If we catch you lying, you lose all funding,” Li said.

Concentrators in Theater, Dance and Media are seeking funding for a new student publication that will showcase the work of students involved in campus performing arts.
TDM concentrator Sam A. Hagen ’18, who is leading the project, said he hopes the proposed magazine will circulate at the start of each semester and will feature academic and creative writing, design sketches, and news articles.
“I thought it would be interesting to have one piece, one physical item, that you can pick up in the lobby of Farkas Hall or wherever, and it will tell you everything that is going on in Harvard theater and dance,” he said.
While TDM concentrators will compose the staff of the magazine, Hagen said he hopes a  range of students involved in the performing arts will contribute.
“Whether it's through the actual performances, production and photography, or the written samples of creative work, the content will come from the wider Harvard community,” Hagen said.
TDM Director of Undergraduate Studies Deborah D. Foster said the TDM faculty committee is “entirely supportive of their endeavor.”
Currently, concentrators are producing content and coordinating the printing of the magazine’s inaugural issue for the start of next semester.
Concentrator Sarah K. Grammar ’18, who is managing the design of the magazine, emphasized the collaborative nature of the project.
“Every concentrator, as far as I am aware, has a hand in it,” she said. “It’s going to be central to our community as a department.”
TDM Chair Martin Puchner expressed excitement about the proposed magazine as a way to record the work done by concentrators and other students involved in theater.
“As anyone who does theater knows, it’s such an ephemeral art form and to leave something that lasts, whether that’s essays, or reviews, or plays, I am thrilled about that,” he said.
Hagen said the TDM magazine will differ from existing student publications through its focus on the experience of students involved in the performing arts.
“The goal of this magazine is to physicalize the experience of theater makers and dancers. It’s not really a comment on or a description of or an analysis of them—it’s a physical embodiment of the work that they do,” he said.
Hagen is still working with TDM administrators to determine how the publication will be funded. He hopes that the concentration will provide most of the funds required to print the magazine, but said the publication’s staff will be applying for grants from the Undergraduate Council and the Office for the Arts.
The proposal for the magazine also lays out an advertising plan that includes soliciting ads from campus performing arts groups.
While the project is stalled until the magazine receives funding, Hagen and Grammar said they are hopeful that the magazine will become a staple of performing arts on campus and the Theater, Dance and Media concentration.
“We’re the first class of TDM concentrators, we are going to establish a record of what we do. It’s going to be a creative project, and it’s going to stay here as long as TDM is here,” Hagen said.

Members of the newly-formed Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies Student Advisory Committee met for the first time this week to discuss how to increase undergraduate involvement at the Center.
The committee is the brainchild of Chinese history professor Michael Szonyi, who took over the directorship of the Center this semester. He said that the idea came to him after he noticed that undergraduates weren’t engaging with the Center, despite significant undergraduate interest in China.
“The basic purpose of the advisory committee is figuring out how to get students, in particular students at the College and MA students, participating in the Fairbank Center,” he said. “It’s basically the first step in a larger public outreach program.”
According to Szonyi, the Center hosts approximately 12 events each  week, and the committee aims to better advertise them to students. He added that President Barack Obama’s former national security adviser on Asia spoke at the Center two weeks ago and few or no undergraduates attended.
The committee hopes to expand the Center’s social media presence and increase collaboration with student organizations. By attaching the Center’s name to speaker invitations, Szonyi said he hopes the Fairbank Center can help bring speakers to China-related student groups.
“We have all these resources, we have all these people, and now how are we going to make that more accessible to the undergraduate community,” committee member Christian P. Bennett ’17 said.
Members of the inaugural committee include leaders of China-related student organizations, students who have worked for the Center, and students with academic interests in China, Szonyi said. Both Bennett and fellow committee member Charlie R. Zhang ’17 completed summer internships in China through the Harvard China Fund.
Zhang said his involvement with the subject outside of the classroom influenced his decision to pursue a secondary in East Asian Studies.
“I want everyone to have the potential to have the experience that I had,” he said. “I just want, for lack of a better term, to have people gain more exposure to these sorts of discussions and these events, which actually significantly affected my experience here at Harvard.”
In addition to meeting periodically and focusing on communication and outreach, the student advisory committee will be involved in the Fairbank Center’s 60th anniversary celebration in the fall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While dining with utensils embellished with the Dunster House crest, some students and professors at the House’s faculty dinner Tuesday gushed about the beauty of the renewed space. Their conversations strike a similar tone to those Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith holds with alumni touring the recently-renovated House. 
As administrators polish their remaining Harvard-wide fundraising priorities in a record-breaking $6.5 billion capital campaign, they have turned to Dunster House as a platform and venue for pitching the House renewal project, a priority that still needs fulfilling.
“[The] Faculty Deans have been very supportive of us holding events in some of their common spaces, mostly to show the alumni the impact of the project on student life and [the] student experience here,” Smith said.
Last year, Smith said it was difficult to articulate a vision for undergraduate House renewal before the first full-scale construction project concluded. Now that potential donors and alumni can view a renovated House, administrators have seized the opportunity to showcase the new spaces.
“It’s nice to talk about it abstractly, but if you can show them, it’s great,” Smith said. “[And] there’s no better way to show how this has changed what’s happening in the Houses than to have the alumni that are thinking about supporting it come to the Houses, talk to the students who are in the House, see in person how the spaces are changing.”
Dunster House Faculty Dean Roger B. Porter said he has worked closely with the College to host alumni and potential donor receptions in Dunster’s new courtyard lounge. He also said students have hosted individual and group tours of the House.
“These events and tours have showcased the new spaces in the House—seminar rooms, lounges, study and exercise spaces, etc.,” Porter wrote in an email. “They have also illuminated for alumni and others how the old (our dining hall, library, and courtyard have been preserved and enhanced) while at the same time creating new spaces with much greater accessibility and how these spaces are being utilized.”
At a two-day “Campus Colloquium” hosted last month, alumni and parents joined Smith and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana for dinner in Dunster to “experience firsthand Harvard’s commitment to ensuring that living and learning communities remain a centerpiece of the undergraduate experience for decades to come,” according to a brochure for the event.
Administrators have enlisted Dunster students to give House tours to alumni, students’ parents, and potential donors to FAS’s House renewal project, according to Porter.
Daniel V. Banks ’17, a Dunster resident and the Undergraduate Council’s Vice President, is one such tour guide. On his tours, Banks said he highlights the importance of communal social spaces in the House, architecture that promotes sustainability, and renewed focus on House-wide accessibility.
“I know how important it is [for] people who are supporting our school [to] see how important their donations are,” Banks said. He added that he leads the same tour, regardless of whether he has alumni or potential donors in his group.
Alex F. Dagi ’17, another Dunster resident, said he has given tours for the Harvard Alumni Association. His tours, for both individuals and groups, focus on how he thinks House renewal has improved the undergraduate experience at the College.
“We bring individuals to the House, show them the basement, talk about our experiences as students living in the new House, and generally speak to what the College’s intentions are for future renovations,” Dagi said. During the tours, which typically last around 40 minutes, Dagi outlines the three guiding principles for the Dunster renewal project: accessibility, sustainability, and the creation of new common spaces.
FAS aims to raise $400 million for House renewal during the capital campaign. In comparison to other FAS priorities, such as fundraising for faculty research and for the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, House renewal has comparatively lagged behind, garnering just under half its goal by August 2015. At that time, the FAS-wide campaign had raised $2.2 billion toward a $2.5 billion goal.
In total, the House renewal project could cost as much as $1.3 billion. In addition to the full-scale Dunster House renewal, Quincy House’s Stone Hall and Leverett House’s McKinlock Hall have also been renovated. Administrators announced that work on Winthrop House and Lowell House will commence in 2016 and 2017, respectively.
Dagi said some potential donors initially express concern that House renewal could ruin the character of Harvard’s Houses and that the renovations could deface the buildings’ classic architecture. But, he said, he thinks “thematically, stylistically” Harvard has  committed to maintaining the old feel of Dunster.
Dominique Luongo ’17, another Dunster resident who serves as tour guide, said she gives tours of the House once or twice a month.
“It was presented to me as an opportunity to connect with Harvard alumni,” Luongo said. “I personally got involved with the tour guide program because I’m very proud of the Dunster.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Associate professor of African and African American studies Laurence A. Ralph argued that treating cases of the police using extralegal force as isolated problems can lead to less accountability.
At the talk Wednesday, which was held at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Ralph focused on his upcoming book on policing, race, and the limits of democracy in the 21st century.
Judith E. Vichniac, Associate Dean of the Radcliffe Institute’s Fellowship Program, introduced Ralph before his presentation.
“Professor Ralph writes about injuries, not just physical injuries, but he’s also talking about social injuries, as well,” she said.
Having started his ethnographic fieldwork in Chicago in 2006, Ralph described his book as a story blending interview data, media accounts, court transcripts, and his own personal observations.
“Throughout the book, I critically examine the American faith in policing, and detail why this faith is eroding in Chicago,” Ralph said.
During the event, Ralph read excerpts of the first chapter of his book.
In the chapter, he argues that treating each occurrence of police brutality as a rare and isolated event can lead to chronic ignorance of general misconduct and decreased police accountability, enabling violence to continue and even increase.
“And when we think about police violence there’s a lot of reasons why people think that they can’t know about it, because they weren’t there when the police allegedly committed a misconduct or something like that,” Ralph said.
“So, when we do have evidence and we do have video, they seem like exceptional cases, but we don’t know the extent to which [police violence] is exceptional. And I want to question this idea, this faith that they are automatically exceptional cases—that if a cop killed somebody then that was just a bad apple.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the course of his career as a conservative intellectual and political activist, Ron K. Unz ’83—now a candidate for Harvard’s Board of Overseers and U.S. Senate in the state of California—has donated tens of thousands of dollars to an organization he describes as “quasi-white nationalist.”
Unz’s public tax filings connect the Silicon Valley multimillionaire with VDARE, a group the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as an “anti-immigration hate website,” in addition to several writers who have published articles arguing that white people are genetically superior and homosexuality is a transmittable disease, among other extreme views.
“I support all these different people and groups because they’re mostly totally broke and they write interesting things,” Unz said of his donations. “That’s the left, the right, all over the ideological spectrum.” 
Earlier this year, Unz and four other alumni launched an outsider campaign for Harvard’s Board of Overseers, the University’s second-highest governing body. Called “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard,” the longshot ticket had two main demands: abolish undergraduate tuition at Harvard and make more data  public about the processes by which the College admits students. Unz, who also began a last-minute campaign for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate in California this year, is critical of race-based affirmative action admissions at Harvard.
While Unz has certainly busied himself with advocacy over the course of 2016, he has for years financially supported a number of fringe causes through a set of foundations and funds. In 2010, The One Nation One California Research and Education Fund donated $36,000 to VDARE over the course of several months, according to the One Nation’s 990 tax filings. Though the organization does not officially list Unz as a staff member on the tax filing, Unz said that he created and funds the group.
VDARE was founded in 1999 by the Center for American Unity, an anti-immigration organization concerned with the “these emerging threats: mass immigration, multiculturalism, multilingualism, and affirmative action.”
“Diversity per se is not strength, but a vulnerability,” the VDARE website reads. “It is a luxury that we can only afford as long as we preserve our breadwinner, the American people. VDARE.com recognizes that mass immigration both legal and illegal has driven America to the verge of bankruptcy.” The website also states that “Human differences are not social constructs.”
Unz said he is well aware of VDARE’s ideology. “VDARE is probably one of the hardest core anti-immigrant webzines around, and I think it would be fair to characterize them as a quasi-white nationalist perspective,” he said. Peter Brimelow, the editor of VDARE, disagreed with the characterization of the site as white nationalist but conceded that it does publish white nationalist writers.
“So I don't regard us as a ‘white nationalist’ site although we certainly publish a few writers I would regard as ‘white nationalist’ in that they stand up for whites just as Zionists, Black Nationalists do for Jews, Blacks etc,” Brimelow wrote in an email. “We're certainly politically incorrect,” he added.
Beyond VDARE, Unz funds several individual writers and thinkers. The Unz Foundation, listed as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt non-profit, also funds a number of fellowships, providing each recipient with five- to six-figure unrestricted grants. Still, the grants come with some strings attached, as the “Unz Foundation does however take a strong interest in each of its grantees,” according to the fellowship contracts.
The Unz Foundation’s most heavily financed fellow in 2008 was Gregory M. Cochran, who received $600,000 to serve as an “Unz Independent Scholar.” Cochran, then an adjunct anthropology professor at the University of Utah, has written that homosexuality may be spread by a “germ” and tied Jewish intelligence to genetics.
Unz also gave $24,000 to VDARE writer Steven E. Sailer, who described his personal ideology in a blog post as “citizenism”— the belief that “Americans should be biased in favor of the welfare of our current fellow citizens over that of the six billion foreigners.” Sailer has also written about what he calls the “black-white IQ gap,” and argued that the devastation incurred by Hurricane Katrina indicated that African Americans “possess poorer native judgment” and “need stricter moral guidance from society.”
Thomas E. Woods ’94, another “Unz Research Fellow,” received $108,000 from the Unz Foundation over three years starting in 2008. Woods, a historian and writer, is a founding member of the League of the South, a self-defined “Southern Nationalist” group of “men and women who are not content to sit by and allow their land, liberty, and culture be destroyed by an alien regime and ideology.”
Unz said he has been public about his background and beliefs, publishing extensive political diatribes on his blogging platform “The Unz Review.” He added that he does not necessarily agree with the individuals and groups he funds, but likes to spend his money to support “controversial” viewpoints.
“I personally don’t support assassinating police officers, but I don’t have any problem with giving money or publishing people who have different views on that,” Unz said, referencing a recent article.  “A lot of these people I financially support are those on the ideological fringe, and many of them say all sorts of outrageous things I don’t necessarily agree with.”
Other alumni have criticized Unz and the rest of the “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” candidates, who include five-time presidential candidate Ralph Nader, for their views on Harvard’s admissions policies. One group, the Coalition for a Diverse Harvard, has decried the “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” platform as antithetical to values of diversity on campus.
“We believe that Harvard should welcome a diversity of ideologies, but not those that promote racism or hate speech. We urge alumni to vote against the Unz-led slate and the hateful messages he funds,” the Coalition wrote in a statement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a College-wide report released last fall that called for greater administrative integration across diversity offices, the College is rolling out a series of initiatives—including a new student advisory council and diversity peer educators—to promote collaboration.
The diversity offices—which include the Harvard College Office of BGLTQ Student Life, the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, and the Harvard College Women’s Center—traditionally create their own programming and have their own set of student interns. Last November, the College’s diversity report stated that the diversity offices “appear to engage in minimal collaboration, [which] seems both inefficient and ineffective,” despite working towards a similar cause.
“Harvard is very decentralized in a way that makes it easy for students to slip through the cracks,” Brianna J. Suslovic ’16, an intern at the Women’s Center, said. “Consolidation would be very helpful.”
According to Assistant Dean of Student Life for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Emelyn dela Peña, while administrators from each office meet twice a month to discuss initiatives, students need to collaborate even more in order to  streamline practices.
“We have to overcome the tendency to want to do our own thing, but rather find places where our works intersects and be very intentional about doing that work together,” dela Peña said.
To avoid duplication in programming and connect students to appropriate resources, a student advisory council is also slated to be established next semester. The council will be comprised of representatives from each diversity office, the Undergraduate Council, the Phillips Brooks House Association, and students-at-large.
They will discuss what a comprehensive campus-wide response to diversity and inclusion would look like, according to dela Peña.
Joshua D. Blecher-Cohen ’16, an intern at the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, said that to create a more robust conversation around diversity, it is important to involve other offices that may not directly handle issues of diversity.
“It’s critical that every office on campus be committed to inclusivity, not just those that explicitly focus on student diversity issues,” he said, adding that the Office of BGLTQ Student Life has collaborated with several administrative offices.
The College will also roll out diversity peer educators, a team of undergraduates slated to run discussion groups about socio-economic status, gender, according to dela Peña, further streamlining  the offices.
Suslovic, though, said she is concerned that this particular initiative compounds the administrative confusion already existing within the diversity offices.
“The thing I worry about is that diversity peer educators are in danger of duplicating work or not getting a good sense of who is responsible for what,” Suslovic said.
Dela Peña said that the diversity peer educator program is still new, and that they are still “working out some of the kinks.” She added that greater integration between offices will only come with increased communication.
“The most important thing to do is to communicate across offices and find the time to get together. We tried to organize a final retreat towards end of semester and we just couldn’t get student schedules together,” she said.

Drawing inspiration from the March 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, a large, outdoor audio-visual art installation sponsored by the Harvard University Committee on the Arts portrays modernity through a chaotic, apocalyptic lens.
The installation, titled “ah humanity!”, will be projected on the Science Center’s facade during the evenings throughout this week.
Featuring a single channel of video and four channels of audio emanating from large speakers, the installation reflects the “fragility and folly of humanity” in 20th and 21st centuries, according to publicity materials.
On Wednesday night, a roundtable discussion of “ah humanity!” featured the installation’s creators and panelists, who commented on the significance of the work and its exhibition at Harvard.
“By incorporating the soundscapes of an array of Japanese disaster films, ‘ah humanity!’ cements the connections between past, present and future,” panelist Karen L. Thornber, professor of Comparative Literature and of East Asian Languages and Civilizations, said. “The installation confounds any boundaries or distinctions among the three.”
The installation, which incorporates visuals from the aftermath of the nuclear disaster, includes a soundtrack featuring tracks from Japanese disaster films as well as synthetic sound.
“Several of the films are dealing with anxiety about atomic energy or about other kinds of forces which… humans have been developing but maybe have gone a little too far,” Ernst Karel, a lecturer on anthropology, said.
Another artist, Véréna Paravel, an anthropologist and filmmaker in the Sensory Ethnography Lab, said the Science Center as a backdrop for the projection provided modern context to the piece.
Panelist Reiko Yamada, a fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies echoed the importance of the Science Center as the setting for the installation.
However, some students did not view the installation as a positive addition to the Science Center Plaza, positing that the audio component created a disturbance for students.
“I think it’s kind of absurd that they’re blasting loud noises outside of our doors for no reason, because there doesn’t seem to be a lot of people watching it,” Canaday resident Liam H. Cleary ’19 said. “Except for me taking a video to show someone how ridiculous it is.”
The Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies sponsored the project with the support of Digital Arts and Humanities at Harvard and the Harvard University Asia Center.

Though Harvard has surpassed its $6.5 billion public campaign goal, the Graduate School of Design is still $22 million away from reaching its individual benchmark.
The GSD has raised $88 million out of the $110 million goal, according to co-campaign chair Philip L. Harrison ’86.  Of this $88 million, $69 million came from the campaign’s quiet phase while $19 million has been raised since the campaign went public in September 2014. 
At a reception at the school Wednesday, alumnus and donor Bart Voorsanger said the GSD is comparatively less wealthy than other Harvard schools.
In an interview after the event, Harrison reiterated Voorsanger’s remarks.
“The GSD is absolutely not a rich school. We are living in a 45-year-old building that's not been really renovated in that time,” he said. “We don’t have enough space to teach what we are teaching. Our students are graduating with more debt than they should. This school is a little bit of an anomaly within Harvard.”
The GSD’s public phase to its campaign started out slow. In its first half year, the school roughly raised roughly $1 million. The current figure means that the school has raised about $18 million in the past year.
Still, the GSD is 80 percent of the way to its goal. Harrison attributed the campaign’s lag behind other schools to relatively lower salaries in the design field. To compensate, the campaign has needed to solicit funds from people outside the GSD community.
“One of the paradigms of this campaign is to connect with people from outside the design professions,” he said. “ We can’t just go to our graduates and say, ‘give us a lot of money.’”
The other co-director for the GSD and a substantial donor is John K. F. Irving ’83, who does not have a GSD degree to his name.
Even though the GSD may have relatively limited finances compared to the whole of the University, Harrison said it still is at the forefront of design education as a whole.
“I think we can be a key part of transforming the industry and actually ultimately making the world a better place,” Harrison said.
The GSD campaign focuses on expanding four areas: research, financial aid, facilities, and overall school capacity. Some areas like research more easily elicit financial donations, Harrison said. He added, however, that the facilities priority still requires a “major push” to obtain the funds necessary to implement renovations the the school has planned for its infrastructure.

Four members of the student activist group Divest Harvard were arraigned and charged with trespassing after staging a sit-in in the lobby of the Boston Federal Reserve, home to the offices of the Harvard Management Company, which manages Harvard’s $37.6 billion endowment.
About 25 members from the group protested against the University’s investments in the fossil fuel industry on Tuesday. Four members of the group physically occupied the Federal Reserve lobby and staged a sit-in for between one and two hours. They were later escorted out of the building by police and arrested.
The four students were released by the Boston Police Department that same day.
Members of Divest Harvard identified the arrested protesters as Naima Drecker-Waxman ’18, applied physics graduate student Benjamin Franta, School of Public Health student Rory Stewart, and Adam Cory Vander Tuig, a student at the Divinity School.
According to Franta and Harvard Law School student Kelsey C. Skaggs, a Divest Harvard member who attended the protest, the four activists were charged with trespassing. The charges were filed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Skaggs said. 
On Wednesday, the four activists met with the claimant. The prosecutors did not ask for cash bail but requested to file a stay-away order against the activists while the case is pending. The court approved the order, said Jake Wark, a press secretary for the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office.
A pre-trial court date has been set for May 4 at the Edward W. Brooke Courthouse in Boston.
The pre-trial will serve mainly an administrative role, Wark said, adding that in the past the pretrial proceeding has been used to resolve cases of peaceful protest ahead of actually reaching a conviction.
“It’s not a situation where we’re looking to secure a conviction,” Wark said. “We’re open to resolutions short of a criminal conviction, and we can pick that up at the next court date.”
“I think it’s very likely that we won’t have to go through an actual trial,” Drecker-Waxman said.
The protests came roughly a month after Divest submitted a letter to HMC President and CEO Stephen Blyth, requesting a meeting to discuss the company’s policies and paths towards “sustainable investing.” In a Tuesday press release, the group wrote that HMC had not yet responded to that request.
“University administrators, as well as members of the corporation and the HMC board, have met with advocates numerous times in recent years,” University spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an emailed statement. “We will respond to their most recent request for a meeting on these issues in due course.”
University President Drew G. Faust has held a firm stance against divesting from fossil fuel investments, arguing that Harvard’s endowment is not a tool for political and social activism. She instead advocates fighting climate change through research.
At the University of Massachusetts Amherst, 15 students were also arrested Tuesday during a sit-in to demand that the university’s Board of Trustees cease investing its $770 million endowment in the fossil fuel industry. Also on Tuesday, Yale began divesting its $25.6 billion endowment from fossil fuel.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Wednesday at Harvad Law School, experts in forensic psychology, law, and juvenile justice policy discussed the Supreme Court’s decision to retroactively apply a recent ruling to ban mandatory life without possibility of parole for some 2,000 incarcerated juvenile homicides.
The event, which drew a large audience, was held as a part of the Project on Law and Applied Neuroscience, a collaboration between Massachusetts General Hospital and the Law School.
In 2012, the Supreme Court banned mandatory life without possibility of parole for juvenile homicides in court case Miller v. Alabama. This year, it retroactively applied this decision to approximately 2,000 incarcerated individuals in Montgomery v. Louisiana, leading to their resentencing and potential parole.
“When the Supreme Court eliminated mandatory life without parole for juvenile homicides, it was unquestionably an earth shattering decision,” Judge Nancy Gertner, the moderator of the discussion and a lecturer at the Law School, said. “Given the plasticity of the juvenile brain, they ought to be sentenced to something that enables a right to hope.”
Panelist Robert T. Kinscherff, senior fellow in law and neuroscience at the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics at the Law School, said that high rates of juvenile homicides in the late 1980s and early 1990s led to the rise of a perception by the public of the teenage “super-predator,” which influenced opinions around juvenile sentencing.
“The fear of the future was that these teen super-predators were remorseless, heartless, highly violent, and were going to somehow attack us at our castle walls and bring us all down,” Kinscherff said. “It was heard in the legislature, and elsewhere, that if you’re old enough to do the crime, you’re old enough to do the time.”
Another speaker, Vincent Schiraldi, who is a senior research fellow directing the Program in Criminal Justice Policy and Management at the Harvard Kennedy School, said social changes have also influenced crime rates, pointing out that education, in particular, offers insights into likelihood of going to prison.
“Advanced degrees are vital to desisting from criminal behavior,” Schiraldi said. “Sixty-eight percent of black males go to prison at some point in their lives if they don’t graduate high school. If they graduate high school, it’s 21.4 percent. If they go to college, it’s down to 6.6 percent, which is still a very high number.”
Schiraldi also argued that the delay of stabilizing life events, such as marriage and employment, has prolonged an individual's state of youth, leading to an increase in criminal behaviors.
“Crossing certain key developmental bridges are associated with maturing out of criminal behaviors,” Schiraldi said. “Stable marriage and steady employment are coming later and later for today’s young people.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a tense meeting with administrators that lasted almost three hours, undergraduate and graduate leaders of Harvard’s final clubs sought specifics on the College’s plan for the clubs. Although many final club attendees left largely frustrated, administrators outlined at least one uncharacteristically specific option for penalizing involvement in all-male final clubs.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said he could consider barring undergraduate members of final clubs from holding leadership positions—such as team captaincies—and receiving fellowships, according to four meeting attendees. Clubs have feared punishments for their undergraduate members amid heightened administrative scrutiny, though attendees said Khurana’s mention of a possible sanction was speculative. 
Still, such a policy would mark an almost complete reversal from decades of administrators’ relatively hands-off attitude towards the historically single-gender social groups. Since Khurana began his tenure in 2014, the clubs have been the subject of unprecedented criticism from top administrators, including University President Drew G. Faust and Khurana. Last semester, the traditionally all-male Spee and Fox Clubs added women to their ranks, with Fox Club undergraduates telling graduate leaders that “Harvard has forced our hand.”
Wednesday’s private meeting between administrators and final club leaders comes at a time of intense administrative pressure on the single-gender organizations, which a recent University report called “often inimical to Harvard’s mission.” According to some attendees, though, administrators largely demurred on specific questions about their plans, despite at least one pointed request sent from the president of the all-male Fly Club for definitive answers.
Ahead of the meeting, Fly Club Graduate President Richard T. Porteus Jr. ’78 sent an email calling for more detailed plans to top College administrators—including Khurana, Assistant Dean for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Emelyn dela Peña, Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich, and interim Dean of Student Life Thomas A. Dingman ’67.
The email, coupled with a rare public statement from the Porcellian Club, set the tone for an often-tense meeting in Cabot’s senior common room Wednesday evening.
“As we approach the end of a full year of conversation focused on that one topic, no details have emerged,” Porteus wrote, referring to the College’s requests that clubs go co-ed. “Therefore, the Fly Club board of directors, at the request of the full undergraduate and graduate membership, has instructed me to inquire of you this evening what, specifically, is ‘on that table.’”
Porteus then asked that the College provide yes-or-no answers to four questions by the end of the meeting.
First, Porteus, referring to Khurana by his endowed title, asked whether “the Danoff Dean of the College” will recommend banning undergraduate membership in single-gender social organizations. A subsidiary to a University-wide report on sexual assault prevention suggested either implementing such a ban or “allow[ing] clubs to transition” to gender-neutral membership and submit to greater University oversight.
Porteus’s email also asked whether Khurana’s pending recommendations to central administrators would apply equally to men’s and women’s clubs as well as the College’s burgeoning fraternities and sororities. Finally, Porteus asked whether Khurana would “recommend expulsion” for undergraduates who choose to ignore a potential final club ban.
Porteus wrote that he would forward his email to colleagues at the 12 other final clubs “to avoid confusion or duplication of aims” given that the College “furnished no agenda” for the meeting. “In order to foster transparency within the Harvard community on a topic that has been an ongoing source of speculation,” Porteus also copied a Crimson reporter on his email.
Asked before the meeting whether Porteus could expect yes-or-no answers to any of his questions, Khurana said “the College will be working to really understand how we can best support the organizations in their transitions to being better aligned with the College.”
According to four attendees of the meeting, Porteus did not receive a clear answer to any of his questions.
“No final decisions have been made, which is why we really appreciate these meetings, because they help inform policy,” Khurana said after the meeting.
Dela Peña said the administration was “in the same place where we were before [the meeting,] where we’re gathering a lot of information and no decisions have been made. I know that that’s frustrating to hear, but that’s just where we are.”
Although Dela Peña said the College has no strict timeline for releasing its plan regarding final clubs, Khurana reiterated his desire at the meeting for clubs to tell him whether they plan on going co-ed by April 15, according to four attendees.
Khurana originally issued that deadline at a meeting with final clubs’ undergraduate leadership on March 29.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Alexander Kerfoot and Devin Tringale will lead Harvard men’s hockey into a post-Jimmy Vesey world.
Fresh off Vesey’s Hobey Baker win, the team announced its newest co-captains during its annual year-end banquet Monday evening at Boston’s Harvard Club. 
Kerfoot, a New Jersey Devils draft pick, has spent the lion’s share of the last two years centering Harvard’s first line between the Crimson’s outgoing co-captains, Vesey and Kyle Criscuolo. The British Columbia native understands he and Tringale have big shoes to fill.
“They’ve obviously both been great captains,” Kerfoot said Wednesday. “How they’ve conducted themselves on and off the ice and how hard they work and how they treat everyone on the team—it’s something I look up to and something that everyone in our class is going to try and emulate and try to continue next year.”
Kerfoot led Harvard in assists this season (30) and finished second in points (34). Tringale, meanwhile, is a fourth-line grinder. The Medford native tallied a career-high five points over 29 games in 2015-2016, but has distinguished himself for his bruising shifts and vocal leadership.
“I don’t see my role on the team changing too much,” Tringale said. “I’ll try to keep doing the same things—just try to be as positive as possible, try to bring energy and as much hard work and grit as I can.”
Together, Kerfoot and Tringale are the 126th and 127th captains of Harvard men’s hockey. The co-captains know each other well. They have been roommates in Winthrop House for the last two years.
“We’re obviously really close, and it’s pretty exciting to get to share [the captaincy] with him,” Kerfoot said. “I think that we have a good relationship, and we both bring different things to the table. It’ll be a good dynamic.”
The 2016-2017 season will be the third consecutive one to feature Crimson co-captains, and the eighth to feature such an arrangement in the program’s 118-year history.
Harvard’s banquet came just over two weeks after the team’s elimination in the first round of the NCAA tournament by way of a 4-1 loss to Boston College in Worcester. On Saturday, ECAC Hockey champion Quinnipiac fell to North Dakota, 5-1, in the national final.
Despite the loss of Vesey and Criscuolo, Kerfoot and Tringale refuse to lower their sights for next year.
“We had a pretty successful season this year, but we have very high expectations going into next year too,” Tringale said. “We think we can be even better next year, and we look forward to giving Harvard hockey fans even more to cheer about next year.”
There were no surprises among the four individual awards announced by the team on Monday.
For the fourth time in four years, Criscuolo received the Ralph “Cooney” Weiland Award for devotion to the game. Since signing his first pro contract in late March, the two-time ECAC Hockey Student-Athlete of the Year has already played three games with the Grand Rapids Griffins, the American Hockey League affiliate of the Detroit Red Wings, following Harvard’s first round exit in the NCAA tournament.
Vesey, three days after receiving national player of the year honors in Tampa, Fla., was recognized with his third straight John Tudor Memorial Cup as the team’s top player.
Since the Charlestown native announced his intent to exercise his NHL free agent option, the rumor mill has continued to spin with regard to the MVP’s professional destination, consuming other Harvard personnel in the process. On Tuesday, Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 gained traction on social media as a potential candidate to replace Claude Julien behind the Boston Bruins bench. So far, the rumors appear to be unfounded, as Bruins management has yet to dismiss Julien from his post.
Harvard used Monday not only to look back but also to look forward. The team’s other two awards on Monday went to underclassmen.
Sophomore goaltender Merrick Madsen received the Donald Angier Hockey Trophy as the team’s most improved player. In his first season as a starter, the Philadelphia Flyers pick won 18 games and posted four shutouts.
Forward Ryan Donato, meanwhile, was recognized as the team’s top rookie with the George Percy Award. Under his father’s direction, the second-round Boston Bruins pick finished the season with 13 goals, two more than Vesey scored in his freshman campaign.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During its recent stretch of conference games, the No. 18 Harvard women’s water polo team has not led much. It held a brief 1-0 lead against Princeton on Sunday, but trailed wire-to-wire against Indiana and Michigan en route to dropping all three games.
Wednesday evening’s match on the road against unranked Brown was supposed to be a bit of a reprieve for the Crimson after facing three of the top teams in the CWPA poll.
For the first three periods, however, the Bears held Harvard’s offense in check, holding onto a 7-5 lead and needing just eight more minutes to pull off the upset.
Three quarters of being behind on the scoreboard, however, sparked the Crimson to a four-goal fourth-quarter rally that included the power-play game-winner with 50 seconds left to finally give the visitors its long-sought lead. Harvard (20-7, 1-3 CWPA) held on to the slim margin to capture its first conference victory, 9-8, over Brown (9-20, 1-3) at the Katherine Moran Coleman Aquatics Center.
Two-meter Melissa Balding completed the comeback with the tying score with 3:01 remaining in the fourth, and attacker Michelle Martinelli capped it off with the game-winner a couple of possessions later, taking advantage of an ejection drawn earlier in the possession by Balding.
“Brown was staying back, so we couldn’t just fake and shoot it into the goal, so we really had to use our reads,” captain Yoshi Andersen said. “Michelle was able to find a hole from the 4-5 side and just gave it her all and got it in there.”
Freshman attacker Kristen Hong led the way with four goals during the game, including two straight that transformed an 8-5 deficit with just minutes left in the game to a more manageable 8-7 score.
“I think we started off the game a little slow, but with our hard work and persistence we were able to come back at it,” Hong said. “I don’t think at any point in the game we ever felt that we couldn’t win the game, and I think that mentality was a big part of the reason we were able to put together a rally.”
Hong’s scores were instrumental in igniting the Crimson attack and added to her total of 63 goals on the season. Her performance came on the heels of three scoreless individual outings in Michigan.
On the other side of the pool, opposing rookie Carmen Rosas also tallied four goals in the contest. Sophomore goalie Marisol Dakan made 10 saves as part of a defensive effort that saw Harvard go scoreless in the first period and remain without a lead until the final minute of the game.
Being behind on the scoreboard was no monumental problem for the players in Crimson, however.
“Our strong bond as a team and our knowledge that we all had each other’s back, both offensively and defensively, helped us get through high-pressure situations,” Andersen said. “Our defense is always very strong, and it definitely helped us out in the last minutes of the game.”
Sophomore goalie Cleo Harrington posted five saves on the night. Senior attacker Charlotte Hendrix finished with two goals, as did Balding, who drew the ejection on the winning possession.
Harvard, even as favorites heading into the matchup, is still only 2-6 against the Bears over the last four years.
Brown figures to not be a power player in the running for a CWPA championship this year, but has always been a worthy adversary for the Crimson to grapple with.
“I think [the win] was huge for us, both for conference play and in general,” Andersen said. “It’s always great to win those rivalry games.”
With its 20th win of the season, Harvard has tied its single-season record for most wins. However, with three games left on its regular-season schedule, the Crimson is looking for more.
“In terms of conference play, we’re hoping that this will allow us [to be] ranked in the top five,” Andersen said. “We’re definitely going to have to finish our games this weekend. Nothing’s really said and done until we take care of business.”
