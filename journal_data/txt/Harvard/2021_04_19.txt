After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I am exhausted.
Researching the murders of Breonna Taylor, Sandra Bland, Philando Castile, George Floyd, and so many others, I was (and still am) livid.
While partaking in the plethora of civil rights protests last year, I was hopeful.
But now, watching a Black man’s character being assassinated — as his actual assassin nonchalantly sits in the same room — I am exhausted. What I have learned from this past year is that after Black people die, after we are brutalized and harassed, we’re the ones on trial.
On May 25, Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, kneeled on the neck of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, for over nine minutes. We’ve seen this before. Perhaps in a different font, but the words were the same. By the time paramedics arrived, George Floyd was dead. Over the past couple of weeks, Derek Chauvin has been on trial for George Floyd’s murder. This, we don’t see often.
At the beginning of the trial, the defense team floundered for any scruple of evidence to justify Derek Chauvin’s excessive and unnecessary use of force. And so it began. What I thought to be a murder trial became a campaign of dehumanization and reiteration of the usual phrases that white people have continued to use to justify racism. “He was a drug addict.” “He’s a porn star.” Hearing these phrases, I was almost in awe of the extent to which politicians and civilians are willing to justify the brutalization of Black people. Then I began to wonder what they would say about me.
Throughout my life, I have made sure to do the right thing. With two parents from Nigeria, I was their ticket to the American Dream, and I did everything in my power not to jeopardize the sanctity of those hopes and dreams. As a Harvard student, I feel like I have mostly risen to those expectations. But through further reflection, I remembered some of the mistakes I’ve made.
I mostly disregard the rules for pedestrian walkways. When I was five, I had a moderate proclivity for stealing chocolate bars from the 99 Cents store. I have lied before, I’ve cheated, I’ve made decisions that I’m not proud of. I know what some of you may be thinking. A police officer would not accost a child for stealing candy! Yes, they would. Well fine, but you can't be killed just from jaywalking while Black! Yes, you can. With George Floyd, it was a counterfeit 20 dollar bill, and only a few months after his murder, news outlets and right-wing media ran with his addiction to prescription drugs. But it doesn’t matter how minuscule or nominal our mistakes are. You can do everything right, but as long as you are Black, your survival is never a guarantee.
What I need everyone to understand is that George Floyd should not be on trial. He is a victim and needs to be treated as such. I have heard fellow Harvard students claim that George Floyd did not deserve such a draconian style of death because he had a family and loved ones, a daughter to whom he never was able to say goodbye. I have heard that Derek Chauvin is wrong because he committed these atrocities without knowing the character of George Floyd, that George Floyd was not a bad person. But even if he was, so what?
He was a human being and that is enough. It doesn’t matter who he leaves behind. I do not care if he was a drug addict because it does not matter. Our personal vices are not justification for unrelenting racism and violence against our livelihood. Black people should not have to be hypervigilant about the mistakes they make or the conflicts they cause, in order to survive. Instead of actively attempting to justify white supremacy and police brutality by perusing through the past of Black people, we have to address the pervasive racism ingrained in our society. As we face the brutal systemic violence against people of color, we must shift the blame from the victim to the perpetrator.
There are going to be more acts of violence like what happened to George Floyd. That is a fact. As these deaths continue to occur, I’m pleading with each and everyone one of you: Stop putting Black victims on trial.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge will pilot a guaranteed income program, doling out $500 no-strings-attached monthly payments to 120 eligible, low-income families for 18 months starting in August.
Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui announced the Cambridge Recurring Income for Success and Empowerment project at a press conference Thursday. Single caretaker households who fall below 80 percent of the median area income and have a child under 18 are eligible to enroll in the program. The University of Pennsylvania’s Center for Guaranteed Income Research, which is advising the city on the new program, will select 120 families who fit that criteria through a lottery.
Siddiqui called the program “a financial vaccine” to protect low-income Cambridge residents, many of whom have been hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic.
“We know single caretaker families in Cambridge are struggling, are well below the Cambridge poverty line, and the impact to single mothers and women of color are even higher; we need a financial vaccine for Cambridge’s most vulnerable residents,” Siddiqui said in a press release Thursday.
One-in-10 Cambridge families with children under 18 live below the poverty line. That statistic jumps to one-in-three for “female-headed” households. A study published by the Cambridge Community Foundation earlier this month found that 20 percent of Cambridge residents make $13,000 dollars a year. Among those low-income households who have children, 70 percent have single caregivers.
Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon, who is helping launch the project alongside Siddiqui and City Councilor Marc C. McGovern, said she believes the program will help families like her own.
“As someone who was raised by a working single mom who endlessly struggled to keep a roof over our heads and food in our stomachs, I know just how transformative this pilot will be for our low-income residents,” Mallon said in the release. “The emotional and financial stress of continually living paycheck to paycheck perpetuates the generational cycle of poverty.”
Cambridge will become the second city in the Commonwealth to experiment with a guaranteed income program.
In November, Chelsea launched a similar program, through which it will grant monthly payments to 2,000 families for six months.
Cambridge joins dozens of other cities throughout the country to pilot a guaranteed income program. Others include Baltimore, Md., Compton, Calif., Oakland, Calif., and St. Paul, Minn.
A study published in March showed a universal basic income program in Stockton, Calif. yielded promising results.
Through the program, in which 125 randomly selected individuals from neighborhoods with average incomes below the city median were given $500 a month for two years, full-time employment increased for those who received the payments compared to those in the control group, and payment recipients were less depressed and anxious.
Then-Stockton Mayor Michael D. Tubbs — a current fellow at Harvard’s Institute of Politics — led the program before founding the Mayors for a Guaranteed Income network, which Cambridge’s Siddiqui joined this year.
Mayors for a Guaranteed Income is the primary funder for Cambridge RISE, contributing $500,000. In addition, Harvard, MIT, and the Cambridge Community Foundation have made contributions to the program ranging from $100,000 to $200,000 each.
Harvard’s Director of Government and Community Relations Tom Lucey wrote in the release that the University is “pleased” to support the universal income program.
“The university is proud of our ongoing work with the City and its partners to address critical challenges facing our community – in areas ranging from public health to equity to social justice – particularly as we emerge from a unique and complex year,” he wrote.

Harvard’s annual Arts First Festival, one of the largest collegiate arts festivals in the country that showcases performers across diverse genres and spaces, is gearing up for its second consecutive year in a virtual format starting Monday.
The 2020 festival took place after Harvard shut down campus last March due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Since then, artmakers at Harvard have found new ways to create a memorable experience in locations around the world.
“Last year, we did a small virtual festival, but because all the closing happened in the middle of March, there was very little time to really do what we’ve done this year,” said Jack Megan, the director of Harvard’s Office of the Arts, which produces the festival.
According to Marin Orlosky ’07-’08, the Arts First coordinator, this year’s festival will showcase podcasts, music videos, digital performances, and site-specific performances recorded on campus and in locations around the world.
“I think Arts First always celebrates the ways that Harvard’s arts community is evolving, whether that’s embracing new art forms, genres, or technologies, and will continue to do so,” she wrote.
One way the organizers adapted the Festival to a virtual format, according to Megan, is by elongating it from the usual four days to 11. This year, the festival’s events will span from April 19 to April 30.
“We can’t ask our audience to go to dozens and dozens of events online, on a beautiful spring Sunday or Saturday,” Megan said. “So the idea is to recognize that people are sick of looking at computers, and therefore take this exciting material, but make it presented in a way that is less demanding of the audience’s time.”
The organizers will also modify the Performance Fair, which normally consists of students performing for hours in 13 different locations around campus. This year, that singular day will be transformed into five nights of both virtual and in-person student performances.
“We’ve asked students, wherever they are, to find a place that is special to them,” Megan said. “They are being filmed in those locations, playing music, delivering monologues, dancing.”
Typically, Arts First employs student producers who are each in charge of one venue during the Performance Fair. Angel G. Hoyang ’22 — an Arts First intern working closely with Orlosky and one of those student producers this year — said student submissions increased this year across all disciplines.
“There’s truly been so many submissions,” she said. “It was incredible to see even just the number of how many there were, and then seeing everything come together in the same place has also been really cool because there’s such a diverse range.”
A major component of Arts First, according to Megan and Orlosky, is the fully staged events or concerts put on virtually by student groups.
These include the Gilbert and Sullivan players, the First Year Musical, and various Harvard organizations like Hyperion Shakespeare, the Women’s Center, and Black C.A.S.T.
Another one of these organizations is Harvard Pops, a symphonic group known as “Harvard’s funniest orchestra” that plays seasonal themed concerts combining scripts, films, and eclectic repertoire.
With the inability for both in-person rehearsal and performance, the group created a four-minute video titled “Pops Gets Funky,” which will be broadcast as part of Arts First. In addition, a five-episode podcast play titled “Popscast: Cereal,” which includes a storyline, jokes, and original music, will be released on the Festival’s website.
“I guess some other challenges were learning new skills on how to audio mix and audio edit in Adobe Audition, and then trying to recreate that orchestra sound with individual instrumental tracks,” said Georgiy A. Kent ’22, one of the co-presidents of Harvard Pops alongside Michael T. Pak ’23. “So that's probably been one of the harder aspects of this online reality.”
Carissa J. Chen ’21, alongside Jessica Lao ’23 and her sister Sarah Lao, created a public art project called “The Loneliness Project,” a collection of letters about loneliness during the pandemic, together forming the longest collective letter in the world. They will share excerpts from this project during Arts First.
“We thought that one of the key experiences of being isolated is a feeling like your voices are not really necessarily heard or not part of the group, and so The Loneliness Project came out of that – a desire to allow people to share their voice in chorus with others across the world and also to serve as a historical archive of some sort of this period of time,” Chen said.
Chen said they originally thought that by the 2021 festival, they would be able to showcase their full exhibit, which they envisioned to be a physical room with mirrors giving the illusion of an infinite letter. However, they are sticking to a digital presentation over Zoom.
“I think this is a great example of how art reacts to the pandemic, and it’s an opportunity for more connection during it,” Chen said.
Arts First organizers said an upside of this year’s virtual format is the increased accessibility, which has yielded a noticeable increase in both performers and anticipated audience.
“When Sanders Theater is full, that’s it — sorry, you can't get in,” Megan said. “But here, everyone can get in. Theoretically, 6,500 undergraduates could come to the show.”
“In a way, we lose the energy of all being together, but we create this broad accessibility for people to participate in the festival,” he added.
Elements of this year could possibly influence artmaking in the long-term, according to the organizers. Orlosky wrote that the OFA is considering retaining the successful hybrid model.
“As we’ve begun discussing the future of the festival, our team is talking about a hybrid model: not simply live-streaming in-person performances, but finding ways to truly embrace both in-person and virtual arts experiences going forward,” she wrote.
Overall, both faculty and students involved are looking forward to the next few weeks.
“I think it’s such a great thing for Harvard to devote so much of a space and a spotlight to the arts in general, because that feels like it’s maybe not super appreciated,” Hoyang said.
Megan added that he always “discovers someone or something new” during the festival, and the one this year will be no different.
“There’s that moment where you hear students you just hadn’t heard before, and see or hear they are playing something, not only beautifully with respect to technique and so on, but they’re really artists. They’re really giving from someplace deep inside,” he said.
“I love those moments of discovery,” Megan added. “I’m sure I’m gonna have them with this year’s festival.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The ambassadors of the United Arab Emirates and of the Kingdom of Bahrain to the United States discussed the goals and impact of the Abraham Accords — a 2020 normalization agreement establishing formal diplomatic recognition and economic ties between the Arab countries and Israel — at an Institute of Politics forum event Friday.
Ambassador of the United Arab Emirates to the U.S. Yousef Al Otaiba, Ambassador of the Kingdom of Bahrain to the U.S. Shaikh Abdulla bin Rashid bin Abdulla Al Khalifa spoke at the event. The discussion was moderated by Bonnie Glick, a Spring 2021 IOP Fellow and former Deputy Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development.
The Abraham Accords, which were signed by the UAE and Bahrain in August 2020, marked a significant step in the relationship between Israel and neighboring Arab countries.
Asked about the economic effects in their countries, the ambassadors said the Covid-19 pandemic has delayed the impact of the agreement. However, they expressed optimism about the benefits to their countries after the pandemic subsides.
“Just tourism alone is going to be a huge driver of investment technology research, agriculture, water desalination,” Al Otaiba said.
In an interview following the event, Glick added that the countries came together to create a “perfect storm of goodness” in which “every single country” in the agreement benefited economically.
Al Khalifa also emphasized during the event the potential for collaboration between the involved nations, saying the agreement creates a “direct pipeline” for collaboration in research and various industries.
“Everyone is going to be diversifying their economies going forward, looking at ways to unlock economic opportunities in technology, AI, FinTech, research,” Al Khalifa said. “When we look at what the Israelis have been able to do, especially in that kind of industry, we find that a lot can be learned. A lot can be achieved together.”
Al Otaiba and Al Khalifa also discussed the future of the Accords and expressed their hope that other countries will enter the deal.
“I think a lot of countries are, for very good reason, in wait-and-see mode, trying to figure out what happens now,” Al Otaiba said. “We have to prove that this works. We have to demonstrate that jobs were created, investment was created, that peace actually has brought some kind of value added to these relationships.”
“I think the involvement of the US is so vital, it’s important as we go forward,” Al Khalifa added. “I think that as time goes by, we will be seeing more and more collaborations across industry.”
Addressing the ongoing efforts to expand the Abraham Accords, Glick, who worked under the Trump administration, said the Biden administration has yet to elaborate on their approach to this issue. However, Glick cited past support for the agreement.
“There’s broad, broad bipartisan support for the Abraham Accords, I expect that will continue. I hope it continues soon,” Glick said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council endorsed an all-Ivy League statement on mental health and allocated funds toward a project supporting transgender and gender non-conforming students in purchasing gender-affirming clothing at its regular meeting Sunday.
The first piece of legislation allows the Council to sign onto an all-Ivy League mental health statement that calls for BIPOC mental health care, active “comp” oversight, increased counseling services, and leave of absence policy reform.
“Mental health is the 2nd leading cause of death among students and 75% of lifetime cases of mental health conditions begin by age 24,” the statement reads.
The statement also details that no Ivy League university scored above a D+ on the Ruderman Foundation scale, which measures university effectiveness in responding to students experiencing mental illness.
“Change must be made by Ivy League administrations in order to foster a more enriching mental health support for their students,” the legislation reads.
Harvard’s mental health services has one counselor for every 500 students, according to the statement. This is higher than other higher education institutions, the statement reads, but it is “still insufficient” to address the mental health crisis students are facing now.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly exacerbated the mental health crisis among college students,” the legislation reads. The legislation calls for all Ivy League universities to address mental health challenges in light of this trend.
The legislation, which was sponsored by Elm Yard Representative Anant P. Rajan ’24 and Ivy Yard Representative Tarina K. Ahuja ’24, passed with a unanimous vote.
The second piece of legislation allocates a total of $450 from the UC’s Health, Safety, and Wellness Committee for Queer Student and Allies’ social transitioning project. The project will provide students with up to $30 each to purchase gender-affirming clothing.
The legislation acknowledges the costly expenses required to legally change one’s name and attire to conform their identity and attempts to subsidize those burdens for transgender and gender non-conforming individuals.
“Clothing is also an important aspect of personal expression, comfort, and professionalism,” the legislation reads. “Approximately 1% of the U.S. population publicly identifies as transgender, with estimated equal or greater representation in the Harvard Undergraduate student body.”
Sponsored by representatives Brooke L. Livingston ’23, Anusha Zaman ’23, Sheila De La Cruz ’22, Soyoun Choi ’23, Esther J. Xiang ’23, and Tarina K. Ahuja ’24, the legislation was passed with a motion to adopt by unanimous consent.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 19, 2021 at 8:30 p.m. 
International freshmen said they reacted to Harvard’s plan for an in-person fall with excitement but said it marks only the beginning of a multi-step process — complicated by visa policies and vaccination rollouts — they must complete before arriving in Cambridge in August.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay announced last month that the FAS is “expecting a full return to campus” and a return to in-person learning in fall 2021. The news came as a relief to many College students.
Gay’s announcement paves the way for international students in the Class of 2024 to learn on Harvard’s campus for the first time next fall. Federal visa restrictions barred international freshmen from living in Harvard’s dorms this academic year. Many reported their first semester of college was marked by social isolation, nocturnal schedules, and inadequate support from Harvard.
Ariana-Dalia Vlad ’24, who currently studies from home in Romania, said she was surprised to learn the “great news.” Still, she said her reaction was dampened by a “lack of trust” in Harvard.
“I can’t say I was excited because, at this point, I’m really not going to be happy until I actually set foot on campus,” Vlad said.
Rosanna Kataja ’24, who lives in Finland, said she had some doubts upon hearing the news FAS is planning for an in-person fall.
“I was happy for sure, but at the same time a bit skeptical,” she said. “People were like, ‘Yeah, we’re going in person!’ I was like, ‘Are we? Are we really?’”
Eric M. Shen ’24, who spent his freshman year at home in Canada, said he felt “a sense of relief” reading the announcement on the heels of “a year of disappointments.”
For many international freshmen, news of an in-person fall means they will undergo the application and interview process to obtain an F-1 student visa for the second year in a row.
Wamalwa Ochieng ’24, who lives in Kenya, said he hopes his visa interview at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi next month will not be delayed. Last summer, his interview was pushed back two months due to Covid-19.
“A concern for me is, with Covid cases in Kenya, the embassy may decide to close visa appointments or reschedule visa appointments, and I’m just really praying and I don’t want to jinx myself,” Ochieng said. “If that happens, that may be a whole different scenario.”
Kataja said she took her visa photo last Saturday and scheduled her interview for late July.
“I’m going through the visa process now again,” she said. “I scheduled the interview appointment which would be July 29 or something, which is quite late, so I hope that they will arrange it that I can come [to campus] on time.”
Kataja said she also reached out to the Harvard International Office requesting an I-20 form, which is needed to apply for an F-1 visa, but has yet to receive it.
“I have mixed feelings about their helpfulness right now,” she said.
Shen said the HIO “has been quite silent” on preparations for the fall semester, except for a recent email relaying information on the visa process that was similar to one sent earlier during the year.
“I feel like we need more information on that because, for one, this situation is different,” Ochieng said.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on student criticisms and referred to previous communications on summer and fall planning from the University.
Gay acknowledged in her announcement last month that there may be visa delays and said Harvard will “directly” help students “navigate their program options.”
Many international freshmen also said they worry their home countries’ vaccination campaigns will continue to lag. Some said they fear the U.S. or Harvard could prohibit unvaccinated international students from coming to campus in the fall.
“The vaccine rollout has been basically nonexistent,” Sakiko Miyazaki ’24 said of her home country of Japan. “If the U.S. updates its travel restrictions on Japan, that’s just gonna add a whole nother layer of problems for us.”
Shen said he is unsure he will be able to receive both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine in time for the fall semester.
“If I only get one shot, is the University going to vaccinate me? Are they going to allow me to enter?” he said.
Albert Yao ’24 said he is pleased Harvard has yet to require students arriving in the fall to be vaccinated, noting that he is not due to be eligible for the Covid-19 vaccine in his home country of Taiwan for the foreseeable future.
In an April 9 email, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 and Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen urged University affiliates to receive the vaccine as soon as they are eligible and noted that Harvard is currently considering a vaccine mandate for students this fall.
“We are actively discussing with University leaders and experts multiple strategies to ensure that our community is well protected against the virus, including the possibility that vaccination will be a requirement for returning students and other community members,” Garber and Nguyen wrote.
Once they arrive on campus this fall, some international freshmen said they are also anxious about adjusting to life at Harvard and in the U.S.
Shen said he anticipates it will be difficult adjusting to life at Harvard as a sophomore who has yet to live on campus.
“I think it’s going to be tough going into second year not having been through the Yard system and enjoying Yard life,” he said. “But again there’s nothing much I can really do — I’m just glad there is something to look forward to at least.”

Dean of Science Christopher W. Stubbs said in an interview that funding for scientific research has the potential to increase under the Biden administration. Stubbs also objected to the notion that there is “academic espionage” on Harvard’s campus.
Though former President Donald Trump had proposed federal budgets that threatened to significantly cut federal funding for scientific research, sparking anxiety and anger among Harvard faculty and affiliates, Congress rejected those proposals. As a result, science funding generally increased during the Trump administration.
According to Stubbs, there is potential for the increase in funding to continue under the new administration.
“There are a number of proposals pending on Capitol Hill that would substantially increase the federal investment in the research and development enterprise,” Stubbs said. “We’ll see how they fare.”
Stubbs pointed to a “technical infrastructure” bill that is currently pending before Congress and a proposal from Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer ’71 (D-N.Y.) that would greatly increase the scope of the National Science Foundation’s activity.
“The science enterprise at Harvard certainly benefits from the taxpayer investing their money through the budgetary process on Capitol Hill,” Stubbs said.
Despite the increase in the amount of funds allocated to scientific funding in recent years, Stubbs noted that since the Cold War, the proportion of the federal GDP invested in research and development has “monotonically declined.”
“There are exceptions to that — the National Institute of Health receives healthy increases in its attempt to address human disease. With the more basic elements of the research enterprise, that’s less true,” Stubbs said.
In the interview, Stubbs also disagreed that “academic espionage” is occurring on Harvard’s campus.
In 2019, Harvard formed two oversight committees in response to National Institutes of Health investigations into potential “academic espionage” cases at American universities. Stubbs acknowledged that these committees are still active and running.
“I’m going to continue to raise an objection to the phraseology ‘academic espionage,’” Stubbs said. “‘Espionage’ means stealing secrets. There’s no classified work that happens on the Harvard campus — the science that we do is published in the open public domain.”
Stubbs said Harvard is primarily dealing with a “completely separate issue” of making sure that the institution and faculty comply with regulations regarding the allocation of federal funding.
In January 2020, federal authorities arrested then-Chemistry department chair Charles M. Lieber, charging him with lying to investigators who were examining research funding he had received from the Chinese government. Lieber has pleaded not guilty and is preparing to stand trial.
“We need to account for faculty effort. We need to appropriately disclose potential conflicts of interest, and we need to attend to all the regulatory elements that come along, and it’s certainly true that those regulatory expectations of the government have been increasing steadily over time,” Stubbs said.
“But the troubles that we have faced in instances on campus have to do with disclosure elements, not espionage elements in any way,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A panel of education leaders discussed strategies to combat racism in school classrooms during a Harvard Graduate School of Education webinar Wednesday.
The webinar, part of the Education Now webinar series HGSE launched last year, was hosted by HGSE Director of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging Tracie D. Jones. The panel included J. Malcolm Cawthorne, a Brookline High School teacher; Jennifer P. Cheatham, a senior lecturer at HGSE and former teacher and administrator; and Heidi Shin, a journalist and radio producer. The speakers discussed the flaws of school systems’ current approach to racism between students and how to address those shortcomings.
Cawthorne argued that the main impediment to anti-racism in the education system is schools’ focus on their reputation — in his opinion, many schools would rather uphold their “brand” rather than try to fix racial issues in their classrooms.
This problem, Cawthorne said, is compounded by the frequent turnover of high school administrators and staff.
“If you don’t really have institutional understanding, with a lot of depth and longevity, then it makes it really hard,” he said.
Cheatham explained that one way to become overtly anti-racist in schools is to encourage teachers to have conversations with their students as different situations arise between classmates.
“As a former administrator, it is important for us to make sure that teachers know that it’s okay for them to take those risks in the classroom — that for us they are not risks, that that’s part of the job,” she said.
Cawthorne added that teachers should use their position as the adult in the room to educate students about racial topics.
“You have to remember who is the adult, and as adults if we don’t actually confront those things, then in my opinion we aren’t actually teaching,” he said.
Shin noted that at the same time, more and more agency should be given to students, so that in the case that an adult isn’t present, race-related issues could be dealt with by the students themselves.
“We underestimate the abilities of students, of young children, to figure these things out,” she said. “They also need a sense of agency — because a grown up is not always present when these things happen.”
Shin also said that fostering anti-racism has to start with teaching students about their backgrounds.
“For children who are confronting racism, they need a really strong sense of their racial identity. They need to know what their family’s history and past has been,” she said.
Cheatham also added that besides working with administrators, teachers, and students, institutional change in combating racism in schools can only happen hand-in-hand with change in society at large.
“It is all about building coalitions and doing it with the community you serve,” she said.
By working together, Cheatham explained, those who work for change won’t feel like they are doing so by themselves.
“When you work in that way, when you work with community, listen deeply, build coalition, then you’re not alone,” she said.

Ahead of Covid-19 vaccine eligibility in Massachusetts opening to all residents 16 years and older on Monday, a number of Harvard students have secured their doses in alternative ways, from qualifying for an earlier phase to getting their hands on a leftover dose.
Harvard, in line with other Boston-area colleges, has not yet administered any vaccines to students. Consistent with its statements throughout the semester, Harvard University Health Services said in its latest email update Friday that it has “received a very limited supply of vaccine” with no expectation of additional doses from the state in the near future.
HUHS directed students to pre-register as eligibility expands Monday and “seek all other available sources” for receiving their vaccines.
Roman Ugarte ’24 has had his eye on getting vaccinated since returning to Cambridge. He said he read about somebody who obtained extra doses that would otherwise go to waste from vaccine clinics.
“It just kind of made my blood boil a little bit,” Ugarte said. “I just figured it’d be worth taking a chance and going forward and seeing if there’s an opportunity to be vaccinated as soon as possible.”
He found success by driving 40 minutes with two roommates to a hospital in Peabody for its first day of vaccinations in late January, where after leaving his information with the receptionist, he received a lucky call from the hospital saying it had exactly three leftover doses.
Ugarte added that he felt “a little bit of guilt” for getting vaccinated before groups he deemed as “definitely more worthy.”
“While I didn’t take a vaccine away from anyone, just the sequencing feels a little weird,” he said.
As part of Phase Two of the state’s rollout, vaccine eligibility extended to certain essential workers, including Ellen S. Hwang ’24, who works at the Playa Bowls in Harvard Square.
Hwang, who received her first dose three weeks ago at Boston’s Hynes Convention Center, said the state did a “pretty okay job” at prioritizing essential workers, though she felt her thyroid condition should have been on the list of qualifying medical conditions.
That condition made serving customers “nerve-wracking” as the weather grew warmer and the lines longer, Hwang said.
“It’s nice to be able to have both doses before having to move home,” she said. “When I get home, I don’t have to worry about finding a dosage.”
Aaron G. Eudaimon ’24 received his first dose of the vaccine through the Department of Defense as a member of the Navy ROTC. To ensure cadets like Eudaimon can safely undergo training during the summer, the Naval Academy moved to start vaccinating all midshipmen by the last week of March.
Eudaimon received his first dose of the Moderna vaccine on March 22 and will receive his second dose on Monday.
“Mostly people ask me ‘Where’d you get your dose from?’” Eudaimon said. “I just tell them, ‘It’s a little complicated. If you want to join the Navy, then you can get vaccinated.’”
Other students became eligible for the vaccine early this month for having a qualifying medical condition.
For Matthew R. Cabot ’24, the news that he could qualify the vaccine as a former smoker came as a surprise. Two-and-a-half weeks after pre-registering, Cabot received his first dose on Friday.
Though he said he believes there was a “perfectly valid reason” for its placement, he felt like he was “abusing the system” or “cheating in a way.”
“It was kind of like a relief to get the first part of the vaccine,” Cabot said. “One step closer to the whole pandemic being over and going back to being somewhat normal.”
Domenic A. Caturello ’22-’23 said he felt a similar relief after booking his appointment to receive the first dose of the Moderna vaccine. Because Caturello has asthma, he hurried to book an appointment when individuals with one medical condition became eligible for the vaccine on April 5.
“I was worried because already on basically a daily basis, I have issues with breathing often,” Caturello said. “So I said it wouldn’t have been so great for me if I got Covid, which I never contracted thankfully. But if I did, I thought it would be a particularly severe case.”
Caturello also helped book his parents’ vaccine appointments for early March. They are both former smokers, he said, which qualified them for early vaccination. Caturello noted that the smoking qualification, however, seemed too broad.
Caturello said he believes one reason the state may not be strictly defining every qualification is because the vaccine will eventually go into the arm of every individual in Massachusetts.
“It’s not like it’s crucial that we vaccinate every person in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts from most vulnerable to least vulnerable, because at the end of the day, everybody should be vaccinated,” Caturello said. “So when a couple of people slip through the cracks, it’s just not a big deal because they were going to get vaccinated anyway in two weeks.”

Let’s face it — life since the pandemic has been quite the ride. None of us could have foreseen even half of this year’s events, yet here we are waking up one minute before lectures (or, you know, two hours past), reaching the peak social experience that is Zoom, and watching time fly by (pun absolutely intended) and disappear into a time warp. With every month, it grows exceedingly more difficult to stay at least somewhat motivated and catch up on the 10 lectures you’ve missed. Luckily, flyby is here to help you finish off the last stretch of the semester strong!
Fix up your workspace for ~optimal productivity~
As much as you may claim that your utterly chaotic workspace is simply an “organized chaos and you definitely know where everything is located,” don’t deny the fact that you’ve spent three months looking for a pencil and eventually found it under the pile of laundry that lives on your chair. Your surrounding environment has a huge impact on your productivity, so it’s time to finally change things up. The Spruce magazine recommends a few steps you can take to completely transform your workspace, including practical storage solutions, the addition of greenery, new lighting, or even an inspirational vision board. But if you’re not feeling up for all that, at least put the laundry away already. We believe in you.
Apps to help you stay focused
Can’t stop reaching for your phone every five minutes when there’s no good reason for doing so? You’re definitely not alone. Mobile app developers have built some adorable applications that can help motivate you to study and stay off your phone. For example, a popular app named Forest has you plant a virtual tree when you begin working, and as time passes the tree continues to grow as long as you don’t leave the app. You can also collaborate with friends to plant entire forests. As an added bonus, the app is partnered with an organization that actually plants trees. If you leave the app, however, the tree dies. Don’t do it! SaVE thE TreES!
Get on top of your sleep routine. 
I know you may be laughing at this one, but seriously, at least try. Despite what you may have heard, it’s not actually possible to catch up on sleep. Not only do you feel like complete crap (and nap through Zoom lectures) when you don’t get enough sleep, prolonged sleep deprivation can actually be pretty dangerous. Our very own Harvard Med School calls out our sh*tty sleep habits by noting several health hazards that come with sleep deprivation, including anything from anxiety, depression, obesity, and diabetes, to an increased risk of car accidents. Ever zone out mid-lecture? You’re actually lapsing into a “microsleep” where you temporarily lose all consciousness. Who knows what you’re capable of doing in that span of time, god forbid you accidentally unmute yourself and don’t realize it until after you’ve passionately performed an Ariana Grande song cover to the entire class. Plus, there’s no good reason to be sleep deprived. We all know you’re just watching TikToks at 3 a.m. and not actually doing anything productive.
Take breaks. But, like, purposeful ones.
I know what you’re thinking: the problem is I take too many breaks! No, the problem is that you probably aren’t smart about the breaks you take. Have you ever heard of the Pomodoro study technique? Aside from it’s awesome name that makes me think of spaghetti, it’s actually proven to be incredibly effective. Essentially, this method says to study for intervals of 25 minutes, taking five minute breaks in between, and after four sessions take a thirty minute break. The University of British Columbia gives a short blurb on the Pomodoro method, and it’s definitely worth checking out. When you do take breaks, consider stepping outside or doing some jumping jacks so that you can pretend you exercised. Plus, you’ll feel as though your breaks are perfectly justified (which they are!).
Have something to look forward to.
We all know that this is not the ideal time to travel or plan holiday parties of any sort. But try to plan something fun for the future so that you have something to look forward to. Maybe that means a family camping trip, or finally taking on a project you haven’t gotten around to. Or maybe even go psycho with some fresh spring decor this year and deck out your home until it’s no longer recognizable. Or knit your dog one of those adorable Christmas sweaters. Or knit yourself a sweater. I’m just throwing stuff out there, but get creative! We can all make the best of our situations, even if nothing is ideal this year. Remember, we’re all in it together.
In short, finding motivation isn’t a hopeless task. Even the most minor changes can be complete productivity game-changers. So hang in there, buy a Snuggie, tune into those last lectures, and have a wonderful rest of the semester!

Harvard Yard: Where an elite college meets a popular tourist attraction. The Yard is home to sleep-deprived students, surprisingly bold squirrels, YouTubers interviewing students for their 10k subscribers, and of course, tourists. For any new students coming to campus, here’s who you’ll find while rushing to Annenberg.
Spy vs. Spy
At first glance, you may be confused. Is this a proctor taking pictures to use as incriminating evidence of you sitting six feet too close to your friends? Or maybe they’re a Yale student, coming to campus to dig up our darkest secrets. Never mind, turns out they’re just another tourist who will go back home with blurry photos of Harvard students.
Touching John Harvard’s Foot
Honestly, all we feel is pity. Don’t you see the shadows of a stream under the foot? The only remnants of a night most of us have forgotten? It does offer us some entertainment, however, seeing those bright-eyed tourists rub that foot like Aladdin’s lamp. Oh no, are you licking it? No no, please don’t, I beg you.
Fig Magazine
If you’re studying on the steps of Widener Library, you’re sure to see at least one person posing in front for the classic Harvard picture. Use this opportunity to kickstart your modeling career! Smile at the camera and give a thumbs up, hiding the fact that your pset is slowly killing you inside.
Clueless (college, not high school)
For some reason, these tourists tend to walk in packs. They manage to somehow cover the entire width of the sidewalk when you’re just trying to get to Annenberg before lunch ends. Bonus points for when they ask you for directions to the Law School and you’re just as lost as them.
Fitness goons
There’s countless places to exercise. The gym, the Charles, a playground. For some reason, however, some people choose the Yard. For those of us there to socialize, nothing really sets the tone like a rando grunting while doing lunges up the steps nearby. Props to y’all for staying active, but can you take it elsewhere?
YouTubers
These are easy to spot. They’re usually carrying a tripod, and expensive-looking camera, and generally look much more put together than the hungover students in sweats walking to their 9 a.m. classes. If you’re lucky enough, you might appear in their “Are Harvard students smarter than a fifth grader?” video later, making a fool of yourself. How’s a comp sci major supposed to know who the last queen of France was?
All in all, Harvard Yard is still a heartwarming place for all of us. Every time you make the trek in front of Widener and feel the stares of what seems like hundreds of eyes, just remember that you too can sit on the steps and watch as people traverse through the Yard. Just don’t slip and fall, that’d be pretty embarrassing.
