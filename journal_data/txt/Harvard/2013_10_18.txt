“Breaking Bad” is officially over (that is, unless the musical I’m writing about it takes off). If you’re like me, there’s now a gaping hole in your Sunday night schedule. Thankfully, that night of TV has a plethora of shows to tide you over until “Mad Men” comes back. Here are my recommendations:

 
-Beaten-down father? Check. Sweet, but sometimes Lady Macbeth-esque wife? Check. Kids who really enjoy breakfast? Check. Cooking? Check. Kleptomania? Check. Guys, “Bob’s Burgers” is practically a carbon copy of “Breaking Bad” and is therefore a natural successor to its throne. In all seriousness, “Bob’s Burgers” is one of the funniest shows on TV right now with certainly one of the best voice actors ever. Just hearing Kristen Schaal scream as Louise for a half an hour is well worth the time watching the show, not to mention the talents of H. Jon Benjamin (“Archer”), Eugene Mirman, Dan Mintz, and John Roberts (who often improvises his character Linda’s songs on the spot, like her infamous “Thanksgiving Song”). It’s really funny, well written, and so much better than the last few seasons of the dried husk that’s still calling itself “the Simpsons”.
-"Homeland," "Homeland," "Homeland.” Say what you want about season two, I think it’s still one of the best shows on TV, with Claire Danes’s cry face cemented in TV history. There are so many twists and turns you barely have time to triple-gasp before you triple-gasp again. Even though Damian Lewis looks unsettlingly like a parrot (I can’t be the only one who thinks this), it’s well worth watching. Plus, Mandy freaking Patinkin and his beard of beards. I can’t wait until HBO orders a show that’s just Patinkin and Patti LuPone running around solving crimes and belting their faces off whilst doing it—“CSI: Buenos Aires.”
-“The Walking Dead” has always been perplexing to me. I watched the first season of the show and enjoyed it, but always wondered how the premise of the show—a zombie apocalypse—could sustain drama for multiple seasons. Now, four seasons later, I think the writers were probably thinking the same thing. Rick Grimes is a vacuum of charisma at the center of an unyieldingly grim show, and his son is hands down the worst child character on TV (minus the “Modern Family” children, of course). Check it out to see how the writers challenge themselves to come up with more implausible storylines.
-“Revenge”. I love this terrible, awful show so much I can’t even deal with it. I have this strange obsession with TV shows with vague, sinister titles (“Betrayal,” “Scandal,” etc.) and “Revenge” ups the ante by having each episode titled in a similarly ridiculous manner (some personal favorites include "Duress," "Penance," "Lineage," and of course "Masquerade"). The first season was actually quite strong, with Madeleine Stowe giving an icy and occasionally hilarious performance as Victoria Grayson. The second season, however, threw whatever plausibility there was out the window and just became an utter mess that I couldn’t. Stop. Watching. Mike Kelley, the creator and former showrunner, was replaced, and the result was a season three premiere that basically undid the entire previous season in 30 seconds. Hopefully they’ll soon be getting back to their old ways.
-Watch “Masters of Sex”! (It’s not what you’re thinking.) It’s my favorite new show of the season, with two incredibly strong performances from Michael Sheen (Wesley Snipes himself) and Lizzy Caplan, (Janis Ian of “Mean Girls” fame, not to mention an all-around awesome actress from the cancelled “Party Down” and brilliant, unappreciated movies like “Bachelorette”). It’s incredibly well written, and the production design is superb—look out, “Mad Men.” The only catch is that the show can only be seen on Showtime.
 
“Breaking Bad” may have taken a trip to Belize, but some solid TV options remain for your Sunday nights. You could use that time to do homework or for intellectual betterment of some sort—but trust me, these shows are better.

Photographer and designer Molly Quill wants you to think of children’s playtime as more than just an idle pastime. Quill’s “Decapitating Daisies,” an exhibit that went up at the Monroe C. Gutman Library in the Graduate School of Education on Sept. 30, is composed of photographs of childhood experiences. The collection reflects on childhood as a defining moment in an individual’s social development and sense of identity. Quill was present at an opening reception on Tuesday for the show, which will be on display through Oct. 31.
According to Quill, who was educated at the Massachusetts College of Art, the work is inspired by several summers she spent caring for the young children of a family friend, which made her reflect on the challenges and wonders of growing up. “This work is an explorative journey of a child…. This work also reinforces the notion that play is an indispensable aspect of human development,” Quill says.  All of the photos are of children that she looked after, some taken in the course of their play and some of which have been deliberately posed.
This is the first solo show for Quill, who says that her interest in photography began as nothing more than a hobby. Quill’s pictures, however, quickly developed into a more substantial lens through which to explore human behavior. “As I began taking more formal images, I was really interested in the duality of being an adult and an outsider as well as a playmate to these children, and this intimacy helped me have a greater understanding of their thoughts and their actions,” Quill says.
“Decapitating Daisies,” the title of the exhibit, is taken from a line in Andrew Hudgins’s poem “Blur,” which focuses on childhood play as exciting, but also boring and frustrating. This theme of boredom is essential to Quill’s work as well. One photo shows an abandoned fossil kit, presumably once the subject of play but now discarded. “[The children] uncovered the fossil, but abandoned the project because of boredom,” Quill says. This idea of boredom and its inseparable connection to play and the process of growing up made “Decapitating Daisies” an appropriate choice of title, she says.
At the same time, Quill recognizes that her work raises pressing questions about societal norms and gender issues almost unintentionally. “In a lot of ways, gender is present in the work—the girl is more of a passive character, whereas the boys have a more aggressive and traditional presence,” she says, referring to the boys’ choice of playtime activities—toy guns, airplanes, and tanks.
Quill also describes the use of color as essential in advancing this dichotomy. There is a more significant use of blue with relation to boys, whereas pink is primarily used in pictures with girls. According to Quill, this distinction began unintentionally, but once she became aware of it in her work, she chose to highlight it further.
Kathryn Robinson, curator and gallery manager at the Gutman Library Gallery, agrees that color is an important aspect of this gender polarity that the exhibit underscores. In addition to the link to gender, Robinson also reflected on the way the photos fit into a larger context of artistic tradition. “These photos really speak to the iconography of art history,” Robinson says. For example, in reference to a portrait of a young girl by a windowsill, the curator says Quill’s focus has an almost angelic, Renaissance look. “The beauty of Molly’s work is that she is able to take contemporary photography and ground it in history, and part of this history is gender representations,” she says.
Next month, the Gutman Library Gallery will exhibit another collection of art pieces, this time from a diverse array of artists. The November exhibit will also include a broader range of media, including paintings, print works, photographs, literature, and film stills that reflect on the theme of education.
Both Quill and Robinson hope that visitors will appreciate the importance of play in human development and one’s sense of self that “Daisies” is meant to communicate. “I hope visitors make a personal connection with the photos and engage with the pictures,” Robinson says.

It’s not every day that you find a sign inviting strangers to free piano lessons in a city square, but on Saturday, passers-by in Harvard Square were treated to this rare musical experience. The Harvard College Piano Society, a group of students that aims to promote musical culture and provide piano instruction and performance, offered free piano lessons to the public at four pianos located in and around Harvard Square for three hours on Saturday afternoon.
The Society hosted lessons at three focus pianos—located in front of the Holyoke Center, at Brattle Plaza, and at  27 Garden Street—from among those placed in public spaces by “Play Me, I’m Yours,” a worldwide art project that aims to give people in urban areas access to pianos. A fourth piano, located at the Science Center Plaza, was originally intended to be used but was locked on the day of the event.
Allen L. Yuan ’15 was the first teacher stationed at the Holyoke piano, which was set out for anyone to play, students, children, and adults alike. Yuan says he is passionate about teaching. During his lessons, he taught a college-aged student the C major scale. She may have been a novice, but by the end of her street lesson, she played the scale fluently—finger crossovers included. Yuan says that teaching piano is symbiotic and hopes the Piano Society’s event will spread music throughout the community. “Teaching feels really good, to get someone to understand and see a student who is happy to learn,” Yuan says. 
  At Brattle Plaza, it was hard to miss the huddle of piano players in the midst of passing cars and pedestrians. Yuan hopes that the Piano Society will spread music throughout the community, and by the looks of it, his wish has already come true, as this piano was being used by five people at once. 
Tania Rivers-Moore ’15 is recital and projects chair of the Piano Society and, like Yuan, says she enjoys teaching. “The most exciting part of teaching is getting inside the mind of someone else and imagining yourself as a novice, seeing what motivates them,” she says. Rivers-Moore says there is a wide range of students—from children who know the basics of piano to adults who have never touched a keyboard. Her favorite part of the job is seeing the adults, who often initially assume they’re too old to learn piano and are too bashful to try, brave the lesson and puzzle out a song.
The Harvard College Piano Society, which has been in existence since 2000, was revived by a new leadership last year and has since garnered some impressive accomplishments—last year, the Society played at Carnegie Hall under a Steinway sponsorship. The Society continues to collect students that are willing to teach for modest wages.Later this semester, the Society will host a tech workshop about the workings of a piano, and the group plans to host several concerts.
At Brattle Plaza, the people clustering around the piano were enthusiastic, with one member of the crowd drumming on the piano and another four flying up and down the keys. They conferred with one another which song to play next. Cherie Z. Hu ’17 offered “Hey Jude” as the final suggestion. Everyone cheered in accord. Hu sat down and began playing the beloved Beatles song effortlessly. Matthew Wu ’17 pulled out the lyrics on his phone. Soon enough, everybody began singing along and the crowd, many of whom didn’t know each other, joined together and orchestrated a song off-the-cuff.

The build-up to “Runner, Runner” has largely been focused on its stars, with Justin Timberlake in a lead role, pitted against the king of the 2013 Oscars, Ben Affleck. It’s a lucrative duo for sure, and the movie clearly recognizes its assets. But any effort to capitalize on the film’s cast beyond its star power seems half-hearted at best. The film is initially centered on the premise of online gambling dominance (never mind that its heyday was in the mid-2000s, and many sites have since been shut down), but soon retreats from this focus into a tired and unexciting story of a lone man taking down a seemingly untouchable tycoon. There’s a sense of staleness that courses throughout “Runner, Runner,” and neither JT’s baby blues nor Affleck’s smooth delivery can rescue it.
 
Timberlake ably assumes the role of Richie Furst, a Princeton grad student in finance who is cheated of his savings in an online poker game. Determined to settle the score, Richie impulsively jets off to Costa Rica to confront the website’s elusive founder, the brash and high-rolling Ivan Block (Ben Affleck). Their unlikely meeting quickly and inexplicably propels Richie into the upper echelon of Ivan’s gambling empire, where the traditional hijinks of a thriller/caper movie ensue. There’s plenty of cash, scantily clad women, a love triangle, and even crocodiles. The crocs, in their two minutes of glory, steal the show—bad news for a movie marketed as a thriller with an exotic backdrop and some high-stakes poker. The film draws on what should be exciting material—gambling! Wealth! Intrigue!—but in the end, whether or not Richie escapes his tropical hellhole is beside the point. Nothing in “Runner, Runner” provides ample motivation to care.
 
The film fails to provide a suitable hero despite its likable lead. Timberlake can only buy so much sympathy, and Richie’s duplicitousness erases that quickly. He is supposedly brilliant, yet puzzlingly trusts Ivan and partakes in the standard practices of shady business—lying, blackmailing, bribing corrupted officials, etc.—without questioning the motives behind them. Flawed protagonists (à la Don Draper or Walter White) are increasingly popular in modern film and television, but cannot succeed without significant character development and complexity. On these fronts, and by no fault of Timberlake’s, the film simply does not deliver. It doesn’t help that Richie’s romance with Ivan’s business (and assumedly more-than-business) partner, Rebecca (Gemma Arterton), has all the sexiness and excitement of stale Wonderbread. One can accept the implausibility of Richie’s arrival in Costa Rica and subsequent employment with Ivan to a point, but he and Rebecca’s lackluster affair is simply bogus, and both undermine the storyline in the end.
 
 To the film’s credit, the cast as a whole performs adequately—rest assured, Timberlake can actually act—and a couple of lines will receive deserved laughs. Affleck, in particular, shines as the perfect embodiment of a leering gambling mogul and punctuates otherwise flat dialogue with smug bits of villainy (regarding blackmail: “You know that voice in the back of your head? That’s not your conscience. That’s fear.”) Timberlake, to his credit, clearly enjoys his time in the spotlight and does a competent job in his role, but he is ultimately working with limited material. 
 
Combined with the film’s overarching implausibility from beginning to end, there isn’t a lot worth seeing, and certainly not much worth paying to see in theaters. “Runner, Runner” never promises to be anything more than a formula thriller, but it does presume to be entertaining. Barring a few decent lines, the sketchy, bland storyline renders the film anything but. Its poker face can only fool the audience for so long, and an abundance of unrealistic moments eventually forces it to fold.

“Romeo and Juliet,” Italian director Carlo Carlei’s most ambitious adaptation to date, attempts to stand out from past renditions of Shakespeare’s famous tragedy. While the film is shot in Verona and follows the play’s general plot, the movie makes the surprising choice to deviate from Shakespeare’s original dialogue. In this pursuit to use more relatable language and even include a few new scenes, the film fails miserably in its attempt to live up to the play and to other famous film adaptations, such as Franco Zeffirelli’s 1968 film starring Olivia Hussey or Baz Luhrmann’s 1996 modern-set adaptation with Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes.
 
Great actors in a timeless story should make for a successful film, but the over-dramatic script and the heavy-handed camerawork end up being comical rather than dramatic. Every time  a main character is introduced, we see a profile of his or her face that lasts for a few seconds, more likely to elicit a chuckle than awe. In addition, though some famous lines from the original Shakespeare appear in the movie, the substituted screenplay, written by Julian Fellowes, the creator of “Downton Abbey,” lacks the gravitas of the original play, leaving some scenes feeling ridiculous. One scene that is particularly striking is when the Nurse (Lesley Manville) strikes up a conversation with Juliet about how sexy Romeo’s body is. This attempt to make the characters relatable to a modern audience comes off as corny and shallow, and even the addition of some original Shakespeare does not help the script. Fellowes should either have committed to Shakespeare or truly written something novel about the story, rather than trying to balance the two.
The talented cast is limited by the shortcomings of the script and directing. Paul Giamatti portrays Friar Laurence marvelously, shining as the redeeming performance of the film with his easy camera presence and dynamism. The other actors give very wooden and hyperbolic representations of their characters—Tybalt (Ed Westwick) is overly violent and spiteful, rendering his intensity somewhat hard to believe. Lord Capulet (Damian Lewis) is an abusive father and husband, but his anger and presence fail to intimidate.
 
The actors portraying the star-crossed lovers themselves, Douglas Booth and Hailee Steinfeld, deliver lukewarm performances. Booth plays a girl-crazy young Romeo, a sculptor and a talented warrior, who is more sensitive than his warrior cousin, Mercutio. His lust for love lacks depth, as does his devotion to Juliet (Steinfeld). Steinfeld brings Juliet’s passionate love for Romeo to life, showing that her love is more than a school-girl crush and rebellion against her parents’ wishes for her to marry Paris (Tom Wisdom). However, the 16-year-old Steinfeld looks like a young girl next to the fully grown and 21-year-old Booth. This visible difference in maturity is hard to overlook, though this may be a realistic depiction of the play.
 
This new “Romeo and Juliet” is not easy to watch. The film has little to offer other than the unintentional comedic value of the overdramatized camerawork and screenplay. The redeeming qualities of the film—Giamatti and the beautiful shots of Verona and the Italian countryside—are not worth the ticket price.

In Anne Carson’s translation of “Antigone,” she attempts to express the importance of what is left unsaid. By choosing to take out much of the original text, Carson zeros in on the most pressing themes of the original Greek classic, at the same time creating space for the audience to fill in some of the gaps. In collaboration with the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club, visiting director Ianthe Demos will put up a production of “Antigonick,” opening Oct. 25 on the Loeb Mainstage.
 
As student producer David C. Manella ’14 explains, Demos approaches Carson’s script with additional nuance. “She does not just come in with a set vision for staging and blocking and impose that on the cast,” Manella says. “Rather, [she] spends a lot of time in the rehearsal room with the text to try to bring the cast to develop their understanding of the text.”
 
Manella says that this is a different directorial strategy than is usually used by student directors, a result of her unique background in dealing with unconventional theater pieces. In the past, Demos has directed Sarah Rudl’s “Eurydice” and Mark Ravenhill’s challenging show, “pool (no water).” 
In addition to constantly updating the staging, Demos decided to exclude Nick—a mute character added by Carson meant to keep time throughout the production.
 
“One thing we worked with the director on was the idea of the audience being Nick,” set designer Daniel J. Prosky ’16 says.
 
Manella hopes that the absent character, meant to represent the “nick of time,” will be filled in by the understanding the audience gains throughout the production. In Carson’s version, Nick illustrates how the characters’ rash decisions lead to the tragic situations that unfold, but that job is left to the audience in Demos’s interpretation.
 
“We want to bring in an audience of people who will hopefully come out with an awareness of the...on-a-dime nature of chaos and frustration,” Manella says.

Amidst the yard sale clutter of broken toys and outdated movies lay a stack of vintage editions of Ladies Home Journal. Anne Taintor ’77 picked up one copy at the top of the pile and began to thumb through the magazine’s pages. She burst out laughing.
“It really was as though the women were speaking to me,” Taintor remembers. “I kind of have a chip on my shoulder more than most people do about gender stereotypes. Seeing these women who were so, so, so happy with their new box of detergent was just really amusing.”
Taintor had an idea: She could use these images in collage combined with text that revealed her own interpretation of what these men and women in the old-time magazines may have really been thinking. She got to work collaging.
Years before encountering the magazines, Taintor studied Visual and Environmental Studies at Harvard. When she was a senior, all of her VES friends applied to graduate art programs, but Taintor could not imagine going to more school—she figured she would try being an artist straight away instead.
“I really didn’t know what I wanted to be doing as an artist, what I wanted to be saying,” Taintor says, remembering her first years out of college. So she painted. She designed dresses and sold them to a handful of boutiques until she realized she was losing too much money. She set up a silkscreen studio that never made a profit. She created beautiful soft sculpture necklaces, paying herself only about two dollars an hour for her labor. Throughout all of these jobs, she waitressed to pay the bills.
After having a daughter at age 28, Taintor felt that she really needed to make a responsible living. She had long been a collage enthusiast, and had even taken some collage animation classes through Harvard’s VES department. Her passion for collage in the years after she graduated caught her father’s attention.
Father: “Why aren’t you doing this full time?”
Taintor: “I wouldn’t have any [financial] security!”
Father: “Well you don’t have any security now.”
Taintor: “…Oh.”
“I just thought if you had a job then you have security,” Taintor remembers, laughing at her innocence. Her father convinced her otherwise, and volunteered to loan her $600 to get a business started, so Taintor set out on the uncertain road of making collages for a living.
“It was a little bit hard to think of myself as a business person because I grew up in a family of intellectuals and of course going to Harvard we used to make fun of the business school students,” she says. “But that’s what I had become, really. I mean there is some art involved but most of [my job] is really running the business.”
Taintor quickly realized that her collages would not have much commercial appeal on their own, so she figured she could make them into things which might sell better. She put her collages on women’s pins and earrings and started selling them at retail craft fairs on weekends. The business was uncertain and exhausting and it required a lot of travel—something Taintor didn’t enjoy very much—but she was able to turn a profit, and she was doing work she loved.
After a few years of traveling to craft fairs, Taintor transitioned to selling her products wholesale, which added a whole new business dimension to her venture as she started phasing out her retail, craft-based approach in favor of mass-production. Recognizing that her products were whimsical items that were humor and impulse buys for customers, she hired a product developer to help her think about which products might sell well with her designs on them.
“One of my better selling products is flask, so I always have to think about new captions that joke about drinking in a way I haven’t already done a million times,” Taintor explains. She has writers who help her come up with captions for her products, and continues to expand into new markets like kitchen accessories and bedroom accessories. Though she was surprised when one of her customers recommended it to her at a fair, magnets have been her best-selling product for over 20 years.
Taintor feels that her art is enduring because the sardonic, feminist messages she channels through her collages are things women still feel today.
Taintor has met some of the models who once posed in the old magazines she uses for collage, and she has stayed in touch with some of them over the years. “These were working women—they weren’t women who were in love with their refrigerator,” Taintor says, mentioning her friend Barbara who was both putting herself through school and supporting a family when she modeled for the magazines all those years ago. “They weren’t the housewives they portrayed [in magazines], and they thought it was pretty darn funny.”
Though gender dynamics have evolved considerably in the intervening decades, Taintor believes that themes of gender stereotyping that are central to her artwork remain relevant today.
Her work is not always easy, as anything can go wrong. She talks about a typhoon happening in China right now in the same town where her products are produced. She doesn’t know if she’ll get her January shipment in time. She talks about needing to problem-solve when her products have strange issues, like the glue not being sticky enough or the size being wrong.
But every so often a customer will reach out with a note of encouragement. One of these came in an email recently, and Taintor cut it out and put it on her desk: “You made my crappy day better.  Thanks.”

It’s an old jibe against the economics profession that no two economists will agree with one another. It’s an old jibe against the stock market that stock pickers can do no better than a monkey throwing dart at the stocks page. It was perhaps based on these convictions that the Nobel Prize Committee decided to award the prize to three financial economists who can’t agree on, you guessed it, whether the market can do better than a monkey throwing dart.
The contentious issue here is the efficient market hypothesis, a theoretical construct that it is impossible to consistently predict the direction of the market. Economists and practitioners had long suspected the randomness and unpredictability of the stock, but it was Eugene Fama, one of the laureates, who first formalized and empirically tested the idea in the 1960s. Fama first debunked the chartists, exemplified by Charles Dow of Dow Jones fame, who claimed the ability to predict future price moves based on past prices. Fama also showed that stock prices respond very quickly to new information. These facts suggest that it would be hard and expensive, if not impossible, to predict price movement based on past information.
While Fama demonstrated that short term stock price movements are not predictable, another laureate, Robert Shiller, showed that they are over the long term. The Nobel Prize Committee cites his 1981 paper that revealed stock price movement to be much more volatile than changes in dividend values. Since stock price should be equal to the expected value of all future dividends, stock prices seem to be excessively volatile compared to the intrinsic worth of future dividends. This result leads to predictability in price movement—if stock price rose relative to dividend, it is likely that such divergence is due to volatility in stock prices rather than expected value of dividends, and one can predict that price will revert back to levels justified by the dividends. Shiller believes that short term unpredictability cannot so swiftly imply market rationality in face of such evidence, calling efficient market hypothesis “one of the most remarkable errors in the history of economic thought”. Rather, he prefers to describe financial markets as overrun by irrational exuberance and animal spirit. He attributes his fascination of these “human follies” to his wife who is a psychologist. Shiller’s research inspired a new, booming subfield of economics called behavior finance that aim to find markets irrationality due to such human follies.
On the other side of the debate, Fama is no stranger to predictability in the stock market. His “three factor model” of stock return can predict price movements based on simple metrics such as firm size and price-to-book ratio, a model widely accepted by the finance community. But Fama prefers to interpret market predictability as a consequence of rational decisions. Specifically, prices change with investors’ appetite for risk. In general, people are wary of risk, and riskier assets have lower prices and higher expected return to compensate for their undesirability. In a good economy, people are more comfortable holding riskier assets, so price of riskier assets, such as stocks, soar. In a bad economy (think the financial crisis circa 2008-2009), people are more risk-averse as the economy creates more uncertainty, and they will not buy stocks even given the cheap price. Rationalists like Fama hypothesized that variation in stock prices reflects the variation in people’s desire to hold riskier assets, which is a rational concern for investors.
Thanks to the third laureate Lars Hansen’s research in econometrics—the economists’ arsenal of mathematical and statistical tools—Fama’s hypothesis can be tested against historical data. Hansen’s main contribution, the Generalized Method of Moments, allows economists to write down complex economic models and estimate model parameters with nice statistical properties. It also allows economists to focus on their parameter of interest, usually a simplified parable of the entire model. This powerful tool quickly became a standard and integral part of introductory econometrics (admittedly, a part that leads to head scratching among students, myself included). Although Hansen’s research is less interpretable to the general public, it probably leaves the greatest mark on economics as an indispensable tool to connect models with empirics.
In 1982 Hansen tested Fama’s hypothesis to estimate the link between risk and asset price, and the data showed that appetite for risk alone cannot explain fluctuations in asset prices. In the vacuum of a conclusive theory, behaviorists offered psychological explanations such as herd mentality and forces of habit. Behaviorists also suggested that institutional arrangements, such as compensation structure for asset managers, can lead to irrational asset pricing.
The fight between “rationalists” and “behaviorists” is far from over, and the answer is likely a mixture of many theories. It is reasonable, then, for the Nobel Prize to be awarded to thought leaders at both camps. In their fight for truth, the laureates greatly expanded our empirical understanding of asset prices. They justly deserve the prize, as the official announcement states, for their empirical analysis of asset prices. The market may behave like a dart-throwing monkey, but this year’s Nobel laureates helped us understand the beast much better.

When I see “Love Your Body” bro tanks around campus, I get excited. Let’s love our bodies! YEAH! Let’s do that! Two years ago, if I had heard about this week’s “Love Your Body Day,” I would have looked skeptically: “Well that’s a little cheesy.” Five years ago: “Well that’s stupid.” “Loving your body” enabled people to accept being overweight. Want to do nothing about being fat? Love your body. Want to ignore your flaws? Love your body.
What changed from sixteen to twenty-one?
I learned about love.
Love.
As adults, I think we can agree rom-coms do not represent love—too romantic, too funny. “Casablanca”: arguable. “Romeo and Juliet”: a little aggressive. “Love The Way You Lie”: That just isn’t healthy.
So what is love? It’s a balance.
To love truly, you must love wholly. See the good, see the bad, like the good, dislike the bad, but love a person for it all. The challenge is to balance those perceptions of good and bad so as to not thrust people onto a pedestal, because you cannot truly, wholly love a statue, an inanimate thing—sorry Erika Eiffel. Two-way love is opening yourself up, showing your good, your bad. Love is extreme because it outlasts so much, but it does not live on the extremes of “perfect” or “disgusting.” On the edge, you have no wiggle room—you are sure to fall.
Love requires interplay. Interplay requires vulnerability. Vulnerability requires respect. Respect requires honesty.
We can learn about love through the relationships around us. No two loves or lovers’ give-and-takes are the same. But those who love will at times be kind, fight, make-up, understand, play, criticize, listen, touch, laugh, frown, smile, cry, scream, et cetera, because all true, lasting loves will experience all emotions, and in the end, it will balance out. Yet who is to say it is not a net-positive balance? After all, we seek love because it makes life better.
But, what is it to “love your body?”
It’s dancing around my room banging my head up and down while belting lyrics to my favorite new song. It’s lying in the sun for hours until my skin is bronzed with a touch of burn. It’s my sister and me stealing the whipped cream off Dad’s dessert, giggling as he glares at us. It’s sprinting after my friends, dashing to get to that store before closing. It’s squatting more than my body weight. It’s making pie dough with my bare hands. It’s taking a nap. It’s kissing him softly, gently, without fear. It’s crying five times watching Blood Diamond. It’s walking barefoot.
It’s a respectful, honest, balanced interplay between mind and body.
We are neither just mind nor just body. Our minds are trapped in our bodies; our bodies are trapped in our minds. Allow them to love each other.
Sixteen-year-old me looked in the mirror and said she was beautiful because her body was skinny. She disregarded her mind: no beauty there. Twenty-one-year-old me is a constant exchange of senses from body to mind and from mind to body. She is honest, she is kind, she is critical, she listens, and she loves. She is neither perfect nor disgusting. She loves her mind. She loves her body.
Love can scare us. It’s vulnerable, and it’s honest. Yet, how liberating it is.

Harvard’s endowment may or may not be political, but it can certainly have enormous consequences on people around the globe. According to a report released by Responsible Investment at Harvard, those consequences are particularly acute in Argentina’s Iberá wetlands, where two Harvard-owned timber companies are making significant profits while causing significant hardship for the area. Politics aside, Harvard has a responsibility to ensure that local communities are not treated unethically by companies that it has a significant ownership stake in.
Responsible Investment at Harvard paints an alarming image of Harvard’s impact in the region. They report that the timber companies impose unsanitary and unsafe conditions on their workers, use toxic herbicides, destroy the region’s biodiversity, and refuse to pave roads despite the detrimental effect of dust on locals’ health. These findings are based on the eyewitness experience of the authors of the report, as well as on conversations with local workers and townspeople. If these allegations are true, Harvard is endangering the lives and livelihoods of thousands of people living in Argentina. Since the returns these plantations bring in contribute to the finances of the University, current Harvard students may be in the undesirable position of benefitting from the misery of other people in very concrete ways. Such an idea is ethically unacceptable.
Harvard, for its part, has not been forthcoming concerning the findings of the report. In the only statement thus far released by any Harvard official, University spokesperson Kevin Galvin asserted that both timber companies in question operate fully in compliance with Argentine law. He further noted that the Forest Stewardship Council certifies one company, and will likely certify the other company soon. Yet audits completed recently by the FSC point toward a less certain outcome. No University official has refuted or acknowledged any of the specific allegations found in the report. Neither Harvard Public Affairs and Communications nor the Harvard Management Corporation—which manages the endowment—could be reached to comment for this editorial.
Harvard’s alarming lack of transparency regarding the ramifications of its endowment practices serves to illustrate the great need for organizations such as Responsible Investment at Harvard. Students deserve to know if their financial aid and research are being funded through the pain and suffering of other human beings, and should work against any such practice.
Harvard needs to seriously investigate and address the allegations raised in Responsible Investment’s report, and needs to do so in a transparent and public way. The University needs to take responsibility for the conduct of its holdings and ensure the ethical treatment of local communities.

Despite the nationwide struggle of brick and mortar bookstores in the online era, the Harvard Cooperative Society announced an increase in its annual member rebate percentage. Coop members will receive an 8.8 percent rebate this year, representing a 10 percent increase from last year.
 
“In a tough retail environment, The Coop is pleased to be able to pay members a rebate of 8.8 percent of their purchases and thanks members for their continued loyalty and patronage,” Coop President Jeremiah P. Murphy '73 wrote in an email to The Crimson.
 
While 8.8 percent is the second-highest rebate offered by the Coop in the past two decades, the store’s overall revenues decreased by 6.7 percent this year, according to a press release sent to members Wednesday. Murphy stated that the decline stemmed mainly from the closure of the Harvard Medical School store when the Coop lost its lease in the Longwood Medical Area.
 
Cody R. Dean '14, a member of the Coop Board of Directors, said the general revenue decline speaks to a greater trend in the textbook industry.
 
“I’ve been on the Board for three years now, and every year we’ve seen substantial decreases in course books and course material sales,” Dean said.
 
Dean added that rental sales of textbooks have increased as the relatively recent program continues to expand and new titles become available for rent.
 
“We plan on focusing on textbook rentals, which are very cost effective for students. Our rental business was very strong this past year and offset some of the sales decreases we experienced in new texts,” Murphy wrote.
 
Dean said that tourist-oriented business also helped offset the store’s losses and increase the member payout this year.
 
The future of the rebate remains an ongoing discussion among Board members, Dean said, as the store evaluates the evolving ways in which people shop and how the Coop can render the best service.
“You can expect some significant changes in the next fiscal year regarding the value propositions that the Coop offers to students and the way that we look at the rebate as an institutional legacy,” Dean said.

Grammy award-winning and internationally acclaimed chamber music group the Parker Quartet was chosen as the new Quartet-in-Residence at Harvard. The quartet will join Harvard’s music staff and begin its teaching experience in the fall of 2014.
 
The Boston-based Parker Quartet is composed of two violinists—Daniel Chong and Ying Xue—as well as violist Jessica Bodner and cellist Kee-Hyun Kim.
 
“To have this opportunity to be part of a wonderful and thrilling residency is exhilarating for us,” Chong said on behalf of the group.
 
The Parker Quartet has performed in concert halls across the world, made several appearances at Carnegie Hall, and taught at schools including the University of South Carolina and the University of St. Thomas. Formed in 2002, the group originally focused mainly on touring in order to gain exposure and establish a reputation, Chong said.
 
"They are definitely one of the most exciting young quartets out there, and they are extremely dynamic," said professor Alexander Rehding, music department chair.
 
On the prospect of teaching and working in residence at college campuses, Chong said, “in the back of our minds, we knew that that would be a dimension to our careers we would want to expand.”
 
With the selection of the Parker Quartet, the Harvard Music Department continues a tradition begun in 1985 of inviting a musician or group on campus to teach and perform in free concerts.
 
Every year, the music department examines a large number of musical groups, from which a select few are then invited to campus interviews. The interview process involves giving a short recital, working with student chamber music groups, and collaborating with Harvard composers, Rehding said.
 
"The Parker Quartet was just very impressive on all fronts," Rehding said about the group’s interview last spring.
 
Remarking on the students he interacted with, Chong added, “we found [them] to be incredibly bright and incredibly talented.”
 
This year also marks a change in the way the Quartet-in-Residence at Harvard functions, Rehding said. Whereas in previous years, groups came to campus for one-week intervals twice each semester, this year the quartet will be on campus for virtually the entire fall semester. Despite the success of prior Quartets-in-Residence, Rehding said, they simply were not able to become fully integrated into the community because of the structure of the program.
 Once at Harvard, the Parker Quartet will assist student chamber music groups and classes, in addition to performing in four concerts. The group will also be at Harvard on Friday, Oct. 18 to perform in the “Music in Time” Concert.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While many politicians and state department officials have expressed skepticism over the sincerity of Iran’s recent proposal to curb its nuclear development program, Harvard affiliates were more optimistic about the intentions behind the plan.
During discussions in Geneva on October 15 and 16, Iran’s foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif outlined Iran’s new nuclear proposal to delegates from China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. While the full proposal has not been made available to the public, some state department officials released information about the proposal to the media under the condition of anonymity.
Robert J. Reardon, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, said that current information available about Iran’s presentation suggests that Iran is willing to restrain its nuclear program in exchange for a reduction in sanctions.
Rami G. Khouri, a senior fellow in the Middle East Initiative at the Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, said he was optimistic about negotiations moving forward.
“For the first time ever, there’s a serious political will from both sides to address the issue,” Khouri said.
While agreeing with the potential promise of the negotiations, Payam Mohseni, lecturer at the Kennedy School, said he was more reserved about the proposal’s execution.
“There are many factors on both sides that could spoil a deal,” Mohseni said. However, he added that he was still “cautiously optimistic” about the proposal.
Reardon said he was equally uncertain about the outcome of the negotiations.
“The two sides still have fundamental differences and their bargaining positions are mutually exclusive,” he said. “In order to get some movement on this, you’re going to have to do it in some small steps.”
Discussing why he felt this round of negotiations would be more productive than those in the past, Khouri pointed to new Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, who took office in August.
“[Rouhani] has great legitimacy and he’s worked on the nuclear issue before” Khouri said. “He’s made it clear that he wants a solution that’s fair to everybody.”
Mohseni said that he believes Rouhani also has a personal investment in the success of the negotiations.
“It’s more than just a nuclear deal to Rouhani,” Mohseni said. “He’s staked his reputation on this. For it to be insincere would not only ruin his international reputation, but delegitimize him domestically [as well].”
According to Nicole Abi-Esber, a student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences focusing on Middle East studies, the desire for negotiation ultimately stems from the Iranian public.
“With the Iranian people electing President Rouhani, they’ve kind of handed him a mandate to take [negotiations] further,” Abi-Esber said. “They’re sick of being international pariahs. They want to participate in the global community.” 
Negotiations are set to continue November 7 and 8.

The Boston Redevelopment Authority board unanimously passed Harvard’s Institutional Master Plan for development in Allston Thursday evening. The plan calls for nine projects that will be completed over the next ten years, representing the first step in Harvard’s long-term vision for its Allston campus.
 
The IMP’s nine projects will comprise approximately 1.4 million square feet of new development and 500,000 square feet of renovations.
 
Notable projects within the IMP include the construction of a new executive education facility at the Harvard Business School, renovations and an addition to Harvard Stadium, and the replacement of Harvard’s existing basketball facility.
 
Representatives from the Boston mayor’s office, members of the task force, and representatives from the offices of state legislators–along with numerous members of various labor unions from the Boston area–spoke in support of the IMP.
 
Task force member Tim McHale said he was “happy to be endorsing Harvard’s Institutional Master Plan” which came as the result of “hundreds of meetings and thousands of hours.”
 
Paul Berkeley, another member of the task force, also pledged his support for the plan, saying, “We’ve reached the point where the confidence level is such that we can move forward.”
 
Harris S. Band, the University’s senior director of Allston master planning, said that the IMP represents part of Harvard’s “vision of transformation” for an area that is currently “[vehicularly] oriented, largely impenetrable to pedestrians, and includes minimum streetscape amenities.”
 
“We’re very proud of this master plan and we believe it benefits not just Harvard but also the community and the city,” Band said.
 
The projects within the IMP will parallel construction of a science complex on Western Ave. that will house the engineering school and a mixed-use development at Barry’s Corner including both residential and retail space that is slated to break ground this fall.
 
Band called the Barry’s Corner facility the crossroads between the University and the community.
 
The IMP approved by the BRA board outlines only the project planning portion of the University’s Allston development, and does not include an additional community benefits package.
 
Community benefits have been hotly debated in weekly meetings between the University and the Harvard-Allston Task Force this past summer and fall. The BRA board will review the community benefits package next month.
 
Harvard affiliates and others who spoke in support of the IMP emphasized the importance of the relationship between the University and the community during Harvard’s continued expansion into Allston. Consuelo Gonzales-Thornhell, treasurer of the BRA board, described the trust of the community that she saw reflected in the development plans.
 
“Harvard has come a long way. I am very impressed by the way you responded [to input from the community and the city] and by the plans you have set before us,” she said. “I could not let this evening go by without congratulating you for that.”

In the wake of the government’s reopening after a 16-day shutdown, affected Harvard affiliates have begun their gradual return to normalcy. Though funding will return for programs like the MIT-Harvard Reserve Officers’ Training Corps and government-funded research projects, many expressed concerns that the impact will not be fully curtailed in the immediate future.
Astrophysics was among the research areas directly impacted by the shutdown. Harvard researcher Mark J. Reid of the Harvard College Observatory said he was relieved by news of the government’s reopening.
Reid, whose research relies on data collection obtained from government-funded telescopes, said he was concerned that a year’s worth of research would go to waste. A crucial data point was two weeks due from collection, and further delay would have made doing so impossible. 
“The shutdown point came really close to wasting half a million dollars of National Science Foundation research,” said Reid. “Another two weeks and it would have been very bad.”
 
Although Reid’s research will continue, he said that it will take a few days for the telescopes to become fully operational. In addition, many researchers are waiting to use the equipment.
 
The shutdown has also been felt in the classroom as online resources provided by the federal government became unavailable.
 
Audrey J. Gaskins, a teaching fellow for a class on nutrition and health, said she was forced to find an alternative assignment for her section while the National Institutes of Health website was down. Students doing thesis research through government sources were also unable to access information they needed. Website functions resumed quickly after the shutdown, allowing research to resume immediately.
 
While the shutdown had little or no direct impact on ROTC training procedure, certain elements of the program were affected. 
No new national ROTC scholarships could have been offered during the shutdown, and freshman ROTC cadets who had not finalized their contracts were prevented from doing so, effectively postponing any pay they could have received.
During the shutdown, members of the ROTC program did not receive tuition or stipend payments from the government. 
Alyssa Pybus, a sophomore at MIT who participates in the joint Harvard-MIT Army ROTC program, told The Crimson prior to the reopening of the government that without her stipend for this cycle, she planned to borrow money from her parents to pay for food.
 
Even after the reopening, ROTC participants have still not yet received payment.
“We have no idea when that’s going to happen, my guess would be that it would take some time,” said ROTC cadet Anne M. Nonnamaker ’16. 
Reflecting on the shutdown, students at the College expressed reservations about the present state of the political system.“I feel everything that happened was a systemic issue,” said Benjamin J. Hughes ’14. “It can easily happen again. Probably will.” 
As a government concentrator, Hughes said he also sees potential for the shutdown to negatively affect career outlooks. “I don’t think anyone would view what happened as positive. No one would say this is a positive or a sign of healthy democracy.”
 
Kathryn G. Walsh ’14, a social studies concentrator, said she believes that this incident can be a lesson for the future.
 “The shutdown can’t always be used as a political pawn,” she said. “I think that the two weeks of shutdown forced both sides of the line to realize the need to work together better.”

One hundred years from Thursday, future Harvard administrators will have the opportunity to open up a time capsule from the year 2013, which will contain—amongst other objects—a used Post-it pad, a first-generation iPhone, Wednesday’s edition of The Crimson, and a can of Coke Zero.
Faculty and staff from the anthropology department celebrated the installment of the time capsule on Thursday afternoon at the main entrance of Tozzer Library. About 50 Harvard affiliates attended the ceremony, including Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith and Dean of Social Science Peter V. Marsden.
Karen Santospago, anthropology communications and design coordinator, said the time capsule marks an important moment in the history of the anthropology department, which has recently expanded its academic program and will soon transfer to a new building. The social anthropology branch will move to Tozzer—which is currently under construction—in the fall of 2014.
“I think it’s a good opportunity to sort of document this moment in anthropology and campus life, to be looked at, you know, a hundred years from now,” Santospago said.
Celia Kent, planning director at the Office of Physical Resources, and John F. Hollister, the Office’s senior capital project manager, first brought up the idea of a time capsule about a month and a half ago, according to anthropology chair Gary Urton.
“[Hollister] forwarded me an article about a recent project somewhere where they had opened a time capsule from a hundred years before, and so I thought, ‘How cool is that?’ especially given that it’s the anthropology department,” Kent said.
According to Santospago, contributions to the time capsule ranged from academic material—like journal articles, books, and syllabi—to objects representing college life, like campus maps and dining hall menus. And of course, the Coke Zero can.
Matthew Liebmann, an associate professor of anthropology who brought the can, said he purposefully left it empty so it wouldn’t explode and ruin the other documents. Liebmann added that he took into consideration the message the Coke would send.
“I wanted an artifact that was clearly from 2013 that most people would’ve considered trash, but says something about the society we live in,” he said.
The department also contributed a flash drive that would contain the anthropology website, Santospago said, “which of course will be a curious object a hundred years from now.” 
Jason A. Ur, an associate professor of anthropology who donated a handheld GPS device to the capsule, also remarked on the significance of the act. Ur said the “direct message” of the capsule contrasted with the “highly fragmentary data” archaeologists usually work with.
“It’s a fun thing,” he said, “and it kind of works well with what we do as archaeologists.”
During the ceremony, Marsden invited all the attendees to join him in a hundred years when the time capsule is opened.
But, Marsden added, “in archaeological time a hundred years is a blink of an eye.”

In the midst of escalating tensions in the Middle East, panelists at the JFK Jr. Forum at the Institute of Politics Wednesday evening said that the American and Israeli governments remain aligned in their international policies. 
 
The panel, entitled “America and Israel: On the Same Page Regarding Regional Challenges?” was moderated by Harvard Kennedy School professor Meghan O'Sullivan and brought together four experienced politicians from both the United States and Israel to discuss past, present, and future endeavors in Arab countries.
 
Panelists—including Robert B. Zoellick, former President of the World Bank, Michèle A. Flournoy ’83, former U.S. Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, Dan Meridor, former Israeli Deputy Prime Minister, and Major General Amos Yadlin, Director of Tel Aviv University’s Institute for National Security Studies—spoke to an engaged audience composed of students, faculty, community members, and an “esteemed contingent of Israelis and Americans” who are currently present at the IOP this week for a private dialogue, O’Sullivan said.
 
The general sentiment of Wednesday’s event was that America and Israel are in almost complete agreement on how to approach tension in the Middle East.
 
“There’s probably an 80-90 percent alignment on issues,” Zoellick said.
 
The event began with O’Sullivan asking the two Israeli politicians in the room to give the audience a sense of the region from the Israeli perspective, to which Yadlin responded promptly, “I’m still an optimist.”
 
“We’re in the middle of a stormy ocean, but on a quiet island,” Yadlin added.  He took a moment to look back 40 years prior, when Israel was engulfed in the heated war against a coalition of Arab States, led by Egypt and Syria.
 
Yadlin elaborated that in Israel’s short history, the country has often faced more dismal political circumstances than those in the present.
 
Still, Meridor stressed the “need to be very cautionary and modest.”
 
“We have seen Egypt in a worse situation a year ago” Meridor said, referring to the Egyptian revolution that culminated in the resignation of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
 
The American speakers appeared warier of the present situation overseas.
 
“I’m usually an optimist by nature…[but] when I look at the region I see some very fundamental shifts and changes that will likely take the next generation to play out,” Flournoy said. “I hate to be the dark cloud after [Yadlin’s] optimism, but I think the region is in deep turmoil.”
 
The conversation was generally well-received by audience members.
 “I feel like I learned quite a bit,” said Yoav Shaked ’17.  “All the speakers were amazing and they spoke very well.”

Just three students were in attendance on Thursday evening as Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith and five members of the faculty search committee for the new Dean of Harvard College led an open and ranging discussion on the search in Pforzheimer House.
 
Despite the surprisingly low turnout—about 25 students attended last week’s dean search forum in Lowell House—the event featured an inclusive discussion on topics ranging from the role of the search committee to the ideal background of the new dean.
 
A topic of interest throughout the evening was what role students and the 21-member faculty committee would play in the search process. Ultimately, Smith will decided the appointment in consultation with University President Drew G. Faust and the Harvard Corporation.
 
“Obviously we have an advisory role,” said government professor Steven R. Levitsky. “Dean Smith is ultimately going to make the decision. But he’s smart enough to know that this is a big and diverse and complex University, and he drew, very purposely, a pretty diverse group of faculty, faculty who represent a bunch of different departments, different tendencies and, in general, faculty who talk to a lot of students.”
 
Smith said that he planned to have finalists interview with both him and the committee, and he said that he was considering consulting a smaller group of students later in the process.
 
“When we get down to a small number of candidates, there are a few students we might pull to just have opinions,” Smith said. He added that the sensitive nature of deliberations might make student involvement complicated.
 
“As you might imagine, we’re going to do a very broad-based discussion of candidates and their plusses and minuses and that can kind of get difficult with students in the room,” he said.
 
Woven throughout the evening was a ranging discussion on concerns that students and committee members hoped the new dean might address. These included the General Education program, which is already set to be reviewed in the coming year, and House renewal.
 
“I want a strong dean who can represent the house system and advocate for the house system to Mike and to the Corporation and to the donors,” said physics professor and Leverett House master Howard M. Georgi ’68. “It’s not going to work unless [the dean is] somebody who knows about [the house system] and believes in it and interacts with students often.”
 
Georgi also said that he would seek a dean with “a significant Harvard experience,” preferably at the College.
 
Towards the end of the meeting, Smith reflected on the last few weeks of the search process, during which he has held four student forums—three open to all students and one with the Undergraduate Council.
 “There are some policies that we’ve heard of as we’ve talked to students, especially when we met with the freshmen [and heard] their initial reaction to some of the aspects of the clubs and the extracurricular activities, [that] I think opened a bunch of our eyes as to what's actually happening here,” Smith said. “We can probably come up with some policy changes in cooperation with the UC and the student body that could remove some of the pressures.”

Part III of a three-part series on the search for a new Dean of the College. Part I ran on Oct. 16 and Part II ran on Oct. 17.
Two weeks before the University launched its last capital campaign in 1994, then-Dean of the College L. Fred Jewett ’57 told The Crimson that he planned to soon retire.
Nineteen years later, the public phase of another fundraising drive began last month with the Dean of the College once again in transition. This past summer, three months before the campaign launch, Evelynn M. Hammonds stepped down as College Dean, setting into motion a search for her permanent replacement in the crucial first months of the $6.5 billion campaign’s public phase.
While the 1990s campaign prioritized beefing up financial aid for undergraduates, this time the stakes of the campaign are even higher for the College. With the University planning to raise nearly three times as much money than in its last campaign, Harvard hopes to partially fund its more than $1 billion House renewal project while continuing to support undergraduate financial aid.
So far, most of the College’s capital campaign efforts have not been directly led by interim College Dean Donald H. Pfister, but by his boss—Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith. The limited campaign role of Pfister, who has said he will lead the College for no more than a year, in part reflects the Dean of the College’s unique position as the chief executive of a school that is subordinate to the FAS.
Still, administrators and student leaders say that the next permanent College Dean has the potential to maximize the College’s gains from the campaign, particularly if he or she is called upon to serve a more active role in soliciting donations.
“He or she should be able to explain to alums the significance of the College and the way we support students,” Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde said. “So many of us are invisible so the Dean really has to be the face of the College—their personality and articulation of our values will be foremost in the campaign.”
FAS AT THE HELM
According to FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal, Smith has thus far taken the lead on the FAS campaign, “including efforts focused particularly on the College.” Besides working with the Office of Alumni Affairs and Development and the campaign co-chairs, Neal wrote in an email, Smith has also coordinated his capital campaign efforts with some of the College administrators.
Interim College Dean of Administration Russ Porter, for instance, wrote in an email that he is “now actively engaged with the FAS Development team in ongoing planning and implementation efforts for the Harvard College campaign priorities.”
But Pfister, who works directly under Smith in the administrative hierarchy, said he has played a limited role in the campaign so far.
“When I took the job, Dean Smith said, ‘Maybe there’ll be some campaign work that I’ll ask you to do,’” said Pfister. “I’m perfectly willing to do it as long as time permits, but it’s not part of a major portfolio at this point.”
Other deans within the College administration similarly said that while they would be willing to help out with the capital campaign, particularly as it pertains to the College, they have not been asked to do so.
Although the Office of Student Life was extensively involved in the planning stages of House renewal, Lassonde said that the nature of alumni gifts, which often “come with strings attached,” limits his role in the process.
“At this point, I’m not involved but I can see myself being called to help,” Lassonde said. “The Dean of FAS is really in charge…. Dean Smith is the one who is mobilized the most and chooses where to allocate funds.”
IN THE INTERIM
With Pfister and his subordinates playing a secondary role in the administration of the campaign, administrators said they were not worried about the lack of a permanent dean throughout these first few months of the capital campaign.
For one, Secretary of the Administrative Board John “Jay” L. Ellison said that even in this transition period in University Hall, College administrators are continuing with their regular duties.
“The work of the College doesn’t stop just because we have an interim dean,” Ellison said. “I would be disappointed in donors for whom it would make a difference, because the College is not one person.”
Furthermore, administrators and students said that Pfister’s low-key role in the campaign so far seems to track with the way previous College Deans have worked with fundraising.
“Going back, I don’t think that [Deans of the College] are expected to solicit for the campaign,” Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said.
And students on the Capital Campaign Task Force, a group convened last year by former Undergraduate Council President Danny P. Bicknell ’13 to represent undergraduate voices regarding the campaign, said they have neither met with Hammonds nor Pfister in their past few months of work.
Still, administrators and students said they believe that if asked to do so, Pfister could be an effective ambassador for the campaign.
“I don't know much about Dean Pfister, but he sounds like a longstanding and distinguished advocate for Harvard,” task force member Michael E. Danto ’13-14 said. “His emails to the College community show humanity and a sense of humor, traits that are probably useful in fundraising.”
Administrators have similarly expressed their support for Pfister’s involvement in the capital campaign, citing his experience as a House master and his familiarity with several administrative divisions as strengths.
“I think Don Pfister would be a very persuasive voice for the College,” Dingman said. “ He has a nice sense of humor and a great understanding of the roles that we play.”
For his part, Pfister said he already knows many potential alumni donors from his days as master of Kirkland House in the 1980s and 1990s, and that, if asked, he could speak to issues that potential donors may find interesting.
ON THE HORIZON
But with Pfister not in the running for the permanent deanship, any active campaign advocacy from the Office of the Dean of the College will likely be taken up by his successor, who could potentially lead the College for the final four years of what is expected to be a five-year campaign.
In light of this, administrators said it could aid the campaign if the next permanent College Dean brings charisma and competence to the job, not least if the dean is asked to fundraise.
Dingman said that while the Office of Alumni Affairs and Development does a good job training individuals in how to solicit funds for the University, a good Dean of the College would already be comfortable with the art of schmoozing donors.
In these solicitations, Dingman said, “What you need is familiarity with the College and knowledge of who you are talking to. Someone with more years spent in the role definitely has an advantage, and personality is a big factor.”
Dingman said that the fundraising College Dean also “has to be good at making people comfortable, has to be a good listener, and has to speak with energy.”
And, according to Lassonde, the next College Dean can also contribute to the campaign by presenting potential donors with a coherent vision of the College’s purpose.
“We need someone who is able to articulate the values and goals of the College and understands how it works...A whole deal of personal appeal is involved as well, as we are trying to persuade,” Lassonde said.
Musing on a potential successor, Pfister said that the next College Dean’s most important role in the capital campaign will be to ably direct the College’s everyday operations to present a good face to alumni.
“I think the main thing is for alumni to feel like the College is in good hands,” Pfister said. “Maybe it doesn’t make much of a difference whose hands, but good hands.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Part III of a five-part series on Cambridge City Council election issues. Read each installment on the Fridays leading up to the Nov. 5 election. Part I ran on Oct. 4 and Part II ran on Oct. 11.
For years, the city of Cambridge has viewed itself as a champion of environmental sustainability; it was first city in the state to have a LEED-certified municipal building and second to implement the state’s “stretch code,” an energy efficiency requirement. Despite Cambridge’s progressive streak on environmental issues, however, a new petition put forth by Cambridge attorney and activist Mike Connolly has put the city at a crossroads as it grapples with what a greener Cambridge will look like in the coming decades.
 
Filed on June 24, Connolly’s petition has pushed the issue of the environment into a central policy to be grappled with in the next City Council term. Also known as the Cambridge Net Zero petition, the initiative would require most large, newly constructed buildings in the city to have no greenhouse gas emissions through the use of clean energy technologies.
Although the  future of the petition itself is uncertain, the City has set up a net zero task force, which met on Oct. 10 to discuss the petition and, more broadly, Cambridge’s environmental future.
In interviews with The Crimson, City Council candidates outlined their view on the future of Cambridge, identifying the tensions between the progressive values Cambridge holds and the feasibility and cost of these implementations. There is no comprehensive or unified vision for the future of a greener Cambridge—instead, there are competing interests and ideas for how the City should proceed, both in the short- and long-term.
But in speaking with the candidates, two major areas of concern regarding the environment have emerged—emissions and transportation.
MOVING TO NET ZERO CITY
Cambridge mayor Henrietta Davis declared October “Net Zero Emissions Month” at the Sept. 16 City Council meeting, the same day councillors approved a new task force to examine the wider implications of the Connolly Petition. At the task force’s first meeting, members convened with City Manager Richard C. Rossi and decided that the Manager would present a proposal on Oct. 21 for the Council to vote on.
But the upcoming vote is only the beginning of the net zero movement. The current task force members decided to create a more long-term task force that would start meeting in January, solidifying the idea of net zero emissions and taking more action to preserve the environment.
“[The Connolly Petition is] a great beginning because it requires any corporation or institution that wants to build in Cambridge to take into consideration what this building will produce and then balance it out,” said City Council candidate Elie Yarden. “The Connolly Petition says that you need to account for the cost of the environment. So, net zero is really the way of saying that everything is accounted for into the future. That’s why I support it completely.”
Several other candidates also appreciated the role of the petition in bringing environmental issues to the fore of the elections, but many candidates were not supportive of the push.
Current City Councillor and candidate David P. Maher expressed his support for the movement but was careful to highlight that he would prefer if the city and community would “put the brakes on this lightly” in order to “[bring] the activist voice, the municipal voice, the university voice as well as the experts together and let them together come up with proposals.”
IS ZERO FEASIBLE?
All interviewed current city councillors stated that as the Connolly petition looks today, it is not feasible for it to pass before the City Council. Concerns were raised about how realistic the demands of the petition are, its endorsement of Massachusetts Class 1 Renewable Energy Credits, and its effect on development in the city. 
 
“I think only in a place like Cambridge could you even be having this conversation. In the realm of realism, right?” said Leland Cheung, a current councillor and candidate. “Nowhere else could even entertain the idea that we ask even more of developers. Everyone else is just struggling to attract businesses and create jobs to put their residents back to work.”
The development community asked the City Council not to approve the Connolly Petition at a Planning Board meeting in August. Echoing Maher’s sentiment on having an inclusive process with the task force, other candidates made it clear that they would only be comfortable moving forward with all stakeholders at the table.
“If you try to impose something which is not acceptable to the developers, then there cannot be developments,” said candidate Mushtaque Mirza. “We need something more practical, and I personally believe the community and the developers have to meet at one point and agree to it.”
Although a tension exists between the pro-development interests in Cambridge and the net zero movement, there is room for debate about how beneficial the petition would be for the environment as a whole.
“At the end of the day, what is best for the environment from a Cambridge perspective is density. If we just take the buildings that would have been built in Kendall Square and move them to Quincy or Waltham or Boston—then we haven’t done [pro-environmentalists] any favors,” said current City Councillor and candidate Craig A. Kelley. “So we need to make sure that whatever we implement as zoning keeps the buildings here and makes them more environmentally sound.”
Kelley added that if it came down to keeping the buildings or keeping the environment, he would vote for keeping the buildings.
WHO WILL LEAD
As evidenced in the interviews with the candidates, the development community plays a central role for city finances in part because Harvard and MIT are exempt from paying property tax for their non-commercial land holdings. This distinction naturally puts pressure on developing commercial land in Cambridge. Yet, Councillor Maher said he did not feel there was a need for such a strict adversarial relationship between business and environment.
“We have done a lot of very, very clever and very environmentally friendly things in this city by being good partners, not by being overly authoritarian,” Maher said. “We have heard from the Chamber of Commerce who said they don’t want this, but if you do this the right way, it won’t have a negative impact on the construction.”
Candidate Jefferson R. Smith expressed that the onus of the initiative should not lie with the City Council and development community but with Cambridge’s two biggest universities, Harvard and MIT.
“If we’re going to be developing together and having a future together, [I think] that Harvard, MIT, and Lesley [should] contribute to a master plan for urban planning,” Smith said. “We should be making sure that we’re all studying our future plans in a collaborative way, working on environmental issues and sustainable development together.”
The Connolly Petition as it stands allows developers to buy renewable energy credits to mitigate their environmental impact, but it is these credits that seem to be most controversial for candidates, ranging from their practicality to their legality. 
Councillor Kelley was unsure about the legality of the process and Councillor Cheung questioned its effectiveness. Cheung recalled hearing stories of other places where people will tear up a solar farm, build up a windmill, then tear down the windmill and rebuild a solar farm just to earn these credits. 
“[The credits] are just kind of shifting back and forth, not audited. There is no standard. It winds up just deceiving. People are just scamming money from well-intentioned people,” Cheung said.
Cheung suggested focusing more on creating a net zero recycling program in Cambridge, and Kelley advocated for creating a more “adaptive” Cambridge. Although the effects of Hurricane Sandy mostly bypassed the city, Kelley highlighted that if the city had felt the full possibly brunt of the storm, large parts of Cambridge would have been flooded and the city would not have the infrastructure in place to best handle it.
SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION
Although some of the environmentally conscious in Cambridge are currently focusing their attention on the carbon emissions of buildings, equally pressing in the City Council over the past years and moving forward is the issue of bike infrastructure. The recent expansion of the Hubway program in Cambridge has increased the importance of coming up with a comprehensive vision for biker safety in the city. 
Cheung, who spearheaded the effort to bring Hubway to Cambridge, explained that the lack of improvement in bike safety was the result of conflicting ideals among bikers. One camp, the more novice bikers, want separate bike lanes, whereas another camp, the more advanced bikers, are advocating for a transport network that sees bikes as mostly indistinguishable from other traffic vehicles on the roads, Cheung said. 
“I think I am more of a novice biker and I think, ‘How can we get those that are not biking to start biking?’” Cheung said. “And that requires separate lines, potentially, separate cycle tracks, which the advanced bicyclists do not like.”
Kelley advocated against bicycle lanes, saying that he believed bicycles belong on the street and should be able to go anywhere they would like to safely.
“I think that bicycle lanes put a cyclist too much in the door zone, and I think they encourage too much biking in that dangerous area,” Kelley said. “I think they are a really bad idea.”
Kelley noted the difficulty of maintaining these separate bike lanes as another argument against the ‘novice biker’ view.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
UPDATED: October 20, 2013, at 8:40 p.m.
David H. Petraeus, former CIA director and retired four-star Army general, will join Harvard Kennedy School as a non-resident senior fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, according to an HKS press release.
 
At Harvard, Petraeus, who resigned from the CIA in November 2012, will partner with Kennedy School professor Graham T. Allison ’62 to head a new Belfer Center project called “The Coming North America Decades.” The project will study scientific, economic, and technological factors that have contributed to North American competitiveness and analyze the potential effects of policy options on American interests.
 
Petraeus’ Harvard project will complement his work for the Task Force on North America at the Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank on international affairs headquartered in New York City. Petraeus co-chairs the task force with another Belfer Center senior fellow, former World Bank president Robert Zoellick, who joined the Kennedy School last year.
 
“We count ourselves fortunate to have David Petraeus making a major intellectual investment in issues so central to a Center whose mission is to advance policy-relevant knowledge about the most significant international challenges,” Allison said.
 
Indeed, Petraeus joins the Kennedy School not only as a seasoned leader with nearly unmatched experience, but also as a robust academic, educated at both West Point and Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.
 
Since his departure from the CIA in 2012, Petraeus has taken on a variety of roles in non-governmental organizations and the financial sector. In March, Petraeus was hired by private equity giant KKR to lead the firm’s newly-created institute for macroeconomic forecasting and public policy.
 
Petraeus has also added positions at other institutions of higher learning to his post-CIA resume. This year, he joined both the City University of New York and the University of Southern California. Unlike his posts at those institutions, Petraeus' position at Harvard does not involve teaching.
 
Petraeus’ stint at the City University of New York, which was announced this summer, was met with mild yet fervent opposition from some of the school’s affiliates. Over 500 professors and graduate students signed a petition asking for Petraeus’ termination after six students were arrested for protesting his appointment on grounds of his actions at the helm of military operations in Afghanistan.
 
After leading war efforts in Afghanistan, Petraeus became CIA Director in 2011. He stepped down from that post following a well-publicized scandal surrounding an extramarital affair with Paula D. Broadwell, a Kennedy School alumna and Petraeus’ biographer at the time. The two met at an event at the Institute of Politics in 2006.
 
The press release does not specify when Petraeus’ fellowship will begin.
 
In July, Gawker reported that Petraeus had secured a fellowship at the Kennedy School, citing documents obtained via a Freedom of Information Law request. Friday’s press release marks the first time the Kennedy School has acknowledged the appointment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the third-straight year, the Harvard men’s basketball team will give fans their first look at the team with Crimson Madness, an open practice featuring an intra-squad scrimmage at Lavietes Pavilion at 7 p.m. on Oct. 18.
Newly added to the event’s program for this year are a dunk contest and a three-point shootout. The festivities will be a little more interactive than in years past, with fans able to take part as judges for the dunk contest and participants in the three-point contest by submitting photos of themselves with Crimson apparel on social media.
Following some introductory remarks by Harvard head coach Tommy Amaker, the dunk contest will kick off the night’s program before the players take to the court for the Crimson and Black scrimmage.
Fans can expect to see plenty of familiar faces on the floor Friday night, including the lone senior from last year’s team, Christian Webster, who returns to the Crimson as an assistant coach for the 2013-14 season.
The event will also mark the first time seniors Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry don a Harvard jersey at Lavietes following their departures from the university last year, but Amaker expects the two to pick up right where they left off after their Ivy title-winning season in 2011-12.
“They know our program inside and out,” Amaker said. “There’s nothing for them to feel uncomfortable with in terms of our system.”
Amaker stressed that partaking in the pre-scrimmage events was an individual choice he left up to his players, but he cited a couple of names as favorites in the dunk contest, neither of which was Wesley Saunders, whose dunk last season at Yale made SportsCenter’s Top 10 Plays on Feb. 23.
“Kyle [Casey] has always been a pretty spectacular dunker—I wouldn't vote against him,” Amaker said. “Agunwa [Okolie] is a high flyer, so he could be entertaining when it comes to that.”
The event is patterned after the “Midnight Madness” tradition popular among Division I basketball programs, celebrating the first official NCAA-sanctioned practice day of season by holding practice in front of fans and media. Amaker hinted that a live look-in at Crimson Madness may be featured on ESPNU or ESPN3, which are airing over four hours of coverage of various Midnight Madness events from around the country.
“It’s exciting to have our program and our team on display for our fans,” Amaker said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Harvard women’s ice hockey team takes to the ice against McGill at the Bright Hockey Center on Saturday afternoon, it will do so without coach Katey Stone at the helm for the first time since before some of the players on the team were born. Stone, who has been the head coach since 1994, is currently taking the year off to coach Team USA for the Olympics.
Stone will not be the only friendly face missing. The program faces the absence of key players, such as Michelle Picard, Lyndsey Fry and Josephine Pucci, who are also taking the year off to train, and the graduation of major contributors Jillian Dempsey ’13 and Laura Bellamy ’13.
Lucky for the Crimson, however, Bellamy has not gone far, as the goaltender ranked No. 2 in Harvard history for overall shutouts has been hired to work with the team as an assistant coach this year.
“What they were looking for was someone with a lot of familiarity with the players and the team and how the program runs,” Bellamy said. “[They] don’t have to worry about finding someone for so short a time.”
Now leading the squad is interim head coach Maura Crowell, who has been with the Crimson for the past three seasons as an assistant coach.
“Coach Crowell has been great as head coach,” junior forward Samantha Reber said. “She has made it an easy adjustment for all of us, and we are excited for what’s ahead this season.”
The team rides a wave of high expectations leading into the season after splitting the Ivy League title with Cornell and losing to Boston College in the quarterfinals of the 2013 NCAA Championship.
In a repeat of last year, Harvard will open its season against McGill (4-3). In 2012, the Crimson downed the Marlets, 4-1, with Dempsey notching two goals and Reber and then-freshman Miye D’Oench each scoring one apiece.
Reber and sophomore forward Mary Parker are the top two returning points leaders from last year. Both had 24 combined assists and goals over the 2012-13 season. Reber had 19 assists last year, the third most on the team behind Dempsey and Fry, who had 21 and 20, respectively. Likewise, Parker had the third most goals last season, with 12, behind Dempsey and Fry, who together found the back of the net 40 times.
Sophomore Emerence Maschmeyer will assume the reins as the team’s leader in the net as the starting goaltender. Last season, Maschmeyer split her time in goal with Bellamy to record 400 saves and a percentage of .935.
Junior Sarah Edney, who was named to the All-ECAC third team, will anchor the defenders. Edney trailed Reber in assists, with 18, last season and crossed the ice for three goals of her own. Junior Marissa Gedman and senior Elizabeth Parker are the only other members of the D-team who return to the roster this year.
Seven freshmen join the team. They bolster the defense heavily in the form of one goalie and four defenders. Sydney Daniels and Hannah Zarzecki are the group’s two forwards.
“The freshmen are great,” Reber said. “They have come in and filled roles immediately. We obviously lost a lot of players from last year, but our freshmen have done a great job of adjusting quickly, and we know that they will be huge factors come game time.”
While Saturday’s game opens the season for the Crimson, the Marlets have already begun their 2013-14 campaign with four wins and three losses. Besides playing local Canuck rivals, they have also faced off with peers of Harvard in the NCAA, besting Princeton and Yale but falling to Providence and Northeastern.
McGill returns its two top scorers, Leslie Oles and Katia Clement-Heydra, who had 37 and 36 scores last season, respectively. Oles has already accumulated seven points split over two goals and five assists. Clement-Heydra has so far found the back of the net three times in the Marlets’ seven contests.
“McGill brings a different game every year, so it’s hard to predict exactly how they will play this year,” Reber said. “What I can say is that every year it is a battle with them, so we can expect the same this year. We are all just so excited to finally play a game, and I think McGill will be a great first test for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since 2002, the Harvard football team has gone 9-1 against Lafayette. In the two teams’ most recent meeting, the Crimson only surrendered a field goal.
But after giving up the most passing yards in program history last weekend at Cornell and four passing touchdowns the week prior at Holy Cross, Harvard hopes the same lockdown defense that earned it the 31-3 victory two years ago shows up on Saturday.
“The last couple of weeks, we’ve played some outstanding passing teams with outstanding quarterbacks,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “[Cornell’s] Jeff Mathews will go down as one of the great quarterbacks in Ivy League history…. I still think we should be a better pass defense team. We still have the potential to become a quality [one], but we’re not there yet.”
Lafayette (1-4, 1-0 Patriot) will be without junior starting quarterback Zach Zweizig, who suffered an injury in the Leopards’ 27-21 loss to Penn in September and hasn’t taken a snap since. That may take some of the pressure off the Crimson (4-0, 2-0 Ivy) backfield. Lafayette has turned to inexperienced sophomore backup quarterback Andrew Dzurik, who has yielded mixed results under center so far. In his two games as a starter, Dzurik has thrown two touchdowns and five interceptions.
Harvard counters with a backup of its own. With starting junior quarterback Conner Hempel rehabbing a hyperextended knee suffered in the second quarter at Holy Cross, senior backup Michael Pruneau will likely be making his second career start.
“We feel like we can win with either quarterback,” Murphy said. “Now we’re in a position to verify that…. I think we’re in good shape at the position.”
Pruneau prevailed in the David versus Goliath quarterback showdown in his first collegiate start against the Big Red’s Mathews, overcoming an interception on his first set of downs to complete 23-of-29 passes for 340 yards and two touchdowns in the Crimson’s 34-24 victory.
“At the beginning of the game, the play calling helped me out,” Pruneau said. “I threw a couple of quick screens, got it out there with easy completions. Then, once the game started getting into its flow and I got hit a few times, I was comfortable.”
But Harvard may not be able to depend on Pruneau and the rest of the offense to continue to bail it out every weekend. The defense, particularly the defensive line, will need to be at its best this weekend to stifle the Leopards’ dangerous running game. Junior Ross Scheuerman leads the Patriot League with eight rushing touchdowns and is second with 5.8 yards per carry.
Ivy League opponents have not been able to stop the tailback either. Scheuerman ran for 162 yards against Princeton last weekend and had two touchdowns on the ground against Penn in week three.
“Lafayette [has] a much different attack,” said senior defensive tackle Nnamdi Obukwelu, who anchored the Crimson defense with two sacks and three tackles for a loss against Cornell. “It’s more based on the running game, and our mentality this weekend is to stop the run and be tough inside.”
According to Murphy, the big men on the frontline are the key to stopping strong running backs such as Scheuerman.
“Having big, strong, athletic, and physical linebackers is certainly helpful, but it all starts up front, and that’s the strength of our defense,” Murphy said. “Guys like Nnamdi Obukwelu, Jack Dittmer, and Zach Hodges—those guys are really outstanding players, and [with them] you can be very physical in style at the line of scrimmage. It makes life a lot easier on everybody.”
When the Lafayette offense does attempt to air the ball out, the Harvard defense will look to minimize its mistakes.
“What we want to do is maintain our game plan of working hard to stop those big plays,” Obukwelu said. “The biggest thing is the big plays. That’s what has killed us most games—the over the head stuff—so we’ll try to stop those, and if we do, we’ll be okay.”
Though the Leopards have only a single win on the season, they have managed to keep close in their two losses against Ivy League opponents. Lafayette trailed, 21-20, at the half against Princeton last weekend before falling, 42-26. Three weeks earlier, the Leopards fell to Penn, 27-21, but outscored the Quakers, 14-0, in the fourth quarter. So although the Crimson has only lost to Lafayette once in over a decade, it still will be taking this weekend’s matchup very seriously.
“It never seems easy against these guys,” Murphy said. “We’ve been very fortunate and just seemed to have played well against this team over the years. When you watch the film [of Lafayette], on both sides of the ball, it never seems like it’s going to be easy—and it never is easy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Head of the Charles Regatta returns to Cambridge once again this year and the anticipation for the event is as high as ever. Hundreds of thousands of individuals will file in from around the globe to either compete in or watch the largest two-day regatta in the world. However, despite the multitudes of people that will flock to the banks of the Charles River this upcoming weekend, there will be a feeling that something—or, more accurately, someone—is missing.
The world-famous regatta will go on without the late Harry Parker for the first time since its inaugural session in 1965. The former Harvard men’s heavyweight crew coach, who was originally diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome—a blood disorder—in 2011, passed away in June at the age of 77.
Parker was one of the most decorated coaches in the history of collegiate rowing. Over his 51-year tenure as head coach, he led Harvard to 22 undefeated seasons, 16 official and unofficial national championships and a 44-7 record in the annual Harvard-Yale Regatta. His impact on the Crimson’s program was monumental.
Yet, behind all of these accomplishments stood a very soft-spoken, humble individual. A man of few words, Parker was nonetheless able to get the most out of his rowers.
“He was very quiet, modest, and calm,” said current men’s heavyweight captain Andrew Holmes. “[But] he wanted to win as much as we did, and I think that was a large part of his success.”
Parker’s reserved demeanor was much different than the strategies employed by some fellow crews of his time.
“You hear stories of some coaches who break down their rowers and tell them they’re no good,” former oarsmen Eliot Hodges ’02 said. “That wasn’t Harry’s style. He never screamed at people.”
Parker didn’t need words to motivate his crews. He set a precedent of success and hard work that his team strived to match through his example. Whether it was by running stadiums alongside the team until the very late years of his life or mopping up rowers’ sweat in the boathouse, he helped motivate athletes to exert themselves to their fullest potential for the sake of the entire squad.
“He created a culture that was highly-team oriented,” Hodges said. “Ultimately, you were what you contributed to the team. It’s a difficult culture to establish [with college athletes] but one he maintained over his career.”
When Parker used his words, he knew how to employ them effectively. Parker put his competitive fire on full display for his team leading up to the 2013 Harvard-Yale Regatta.
“He was the most pumped up I’ve ever seen him the week leading up to [the spring’s] Harvard-Yale Regatta,” Holmes said. “He was often struggling with his health, but no one noticed because he was so focused on how much he wanted to beat Yale.”
While Parker had most of his success at Harvard, his accomplishments extended outside the realm of Cambridge. His achievements pushed American crews to change the way they operated. Parker is credited with creating the fall head racing season in the US.
“He revolutionized American rowing,” said Greg Stone ’75, another former rower of Parker’s . “Since he was so observant on the international scene, he was able to bring the best of world rowing to the American system. When he came to Harvard in the ’60s, he brought the techniques…that the Germans [and Russians] were using to train.”
Under Parker, Harvard crews were pictures of excellence in collegiate rowing.
Other programs strived to compete with the dominant Crimson crews. Steve Gladstone, who was the head coach of the Harvard lightweight men from 1970-74 before moving on to heavyweight at other institutions, looked forward to competing with Harvard.
“It was very exciting to compete with Harvard crews,” said Gladstone, speaking about his time at Brown from 1982-1994. “There was a consistency in performance with Harvard, and I think that consistency stimulated other programs to reach their standard.”
Parker achieved success on the world stage as well. He coached several men’s Olympic crews from 1964-1984, leading his teams to three medals during his tenure. However, given the state of women’s sports in this era, his success with the women’s Olympic team was perhaps more notable.
In 1975, Parker became the first women’s national team coach in American rowing history. His impact was immediate, leading the eight-woman squad to a silver medal in its first appearance at the World Rowing Championship. The next year, he led the team to a bronze medal in the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal.
“He put women’s rowing on the map,” Stone said. “He coached women the same as men and they performed the same. He was very much an egalitarian at the time when most male athletes and coaches were not.”
Parker’s impact on his oarsmen stretched beyond just rowing; his former athletes say that the relationships he formed with them transcended their years with the Harvard crew and helped shape who they were as people.
When the former Crimson coach was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome in 2011, Hodges and other rowers asked many former oarsmen for some notes that could be amalgamated in a get-well soon card. The expectations for the messages were not too large—more or less, just some small words of encouragement. The response they received, however, was much greater than they had imagined, as over 400 rowers took the time to send him sincere messages.
“It was incredible,” Hodges said. “They weren’t just [get better soon] messages. They were robust paragraphs, sometimes even long letters, saying how Harry Parker had deeply impacted their lives.”
While Parker impacted the lives of many of those who rowed under his watch, they perhaps affected him just as much. The oarsmen meant as much to Parker as he meant to them.
“His best friends were the people he used to coach,” said Abigail Parker, Harry’s daughter and current Harvard rower. “They would have reunions and spend a lot of time together. You could tell that they were all grateful for the impact they had on each other.”
In honor of the legendary coach, the Head of the Charles Regatta administration will recognize a moment of silence before racing begins.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roughly 9,000 rowers will pour into Cambridge this weekend to compete in the 49th annual Head of the Charles Regatta. But the athletes will be far from the only visitors along the Charles this weekend, as upwards of 400,000 spectators are expected to be in attendance during the two-day event.
With so many individuals flocking to the river, the Regatta will require 1,400 volunteers alone, and the event has developed into an economic coup for the city of Cambridge.
According to statistics on the Head of the Charles website, the regatta weekend generates $4.8 million in local and state tax revenue. But the city is not the only local entity benefiting from the massive event.
The regatta weekend also provides a huge boost to local businesses and hotels in the area, generating around $47 million and making the weekend a key factor in the bottom lines of many Cambridge businesses.
Local business is far from the only entity to thrive on the money that is generated from the Head of the Charles, as the two-day event now features dozens of sponsors, such as New Balance and Sierra Nevada.
This year’s Regatta features four premier sponsors in BNY Mellon, Greater Boston Mini Cooper, Brooks Brothers, and the EMC Corporation.
“[Selecting sponsors] really works both ways,” said Fred Schoch, the executive director of the Head of the Charles Regatta. “It took me 20 years to get New Balance to say ‘yes,’ and we’re excited they did this year. They have been a fantastic partner, and I think they will be thrilled this year after they experience the event. Sometimes it’s serendipity and sometimes just persistence.”
Though the Head of the Charles is now a sponsor-laden event, the regatta has not always featured such an array of participating companies.
Until 1990, the Regatta relied heavily on the budget of the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC) for success. While the MDC still plays a role in organization, security, and cleanup for the Head of the Charles, that role was greatly lessened when BayBank signed on as the first corporate sponsor of the event 23 years ago.
BayBank remained the event’s major sponsor until 1997, along the way creating the first Head of the Charles website to report results. For a two-year period after 1997, the Regatta was once again without a major sponsor. But in 2000, Charles Schwab stepped in as a corporate sponsor, and the regatta has featured one or more such sponsors every year since.
For many companies, the advantages of signing on as a sponsor for Head of the Charles are clear. The Regatta attracts thousands of competitors and alumni from some of the world’s most prestigious universities to go along with the large contingent of local Cambridge and Boston spectators. This uniqueness is what made BNY Mellon, a financial management company, choose to become involved with the event.
“The sport of rowing offers a powerful metaphor for BNY Mellon’s emphasis on teamwork and collaboration,” wrote Larry Hughes, CEO of BNY Mellon, in an emailed statement. “It’s about working in unison.”
The company is also involved with other regattas, but to BNY Mellon, the Head of the Charles is special because of its annual success and Boston connection.
“Last year’s HOCR was a big success, drawing about 400,000 spectators.” Hughes wrote. “Given the importance of the HOCR as a premier international rowing event and its place as a Boston institution, we felt it was a great fit for a long-term relationship.”
Although the Head of the Charles benefits from major sponsorship such as BNY Mellon, Brooks Brothers, Sperry’s, and New Balance, smaller companies also use the event as a way to present themselves to the public. One example this year is the Boston Burger Company.
In its first year of business, the Boston Burger Co. thought the Head of the Charles would be a great way to introduce its product to the public. Despite being a new sponsor that is not nearly on the same scale as an international company such as BNY Mellon, Boston Burger saw the same spark in the Head of the Charles as a distinctive opportunity.
“[It’s] outside on the banks of the Charles River, which, when the weather cooperates, makes for a great setting,” wrote Paul Malvone of Boston Burger Co in an emailed statement. “It’s the tradition of the event. The fact that people come from across the country and from around the world to compete here.”
Customers interested in sampling the food of Boston Burger Co. will be able to see what this new establishment has to offer, as it will be setting up a mini-outdoor restaurant for the weekend.
While Boston Burger Co. will be located in the reunion village for the weekend, many other local and national sponsors will be located at the Weld Exhibition area. A popular location for spectators, the Weld Exhibition provides vendors with the chance to interact with the hundreds of thousands of consumers who will arrive in Cambridge this weekend.
“The regatta weekend brings thousands of people to the Square for dining, shopping, tours, and cultural events,” wrote Denise Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, in an emailed statement. “It is a weekend of celebration, competition, excitement, and great energy that gives a boost to all our businesses.”

One weekend every October, the Charles River comes alive with rowers from around the world in the most famous regatta this side of the Atlantic.
Standing with a short and petite frame, Mary “Liz” Stone doesn’t come off as a distinctive rower in this race, until you notice her snow-white curly hair. Stone is 86 years old, making her the oldest competing rower in this year’s Head of the Charles Regatta.
For the past 18 years, the California native has made it out without fail for this historical race. Her advanced age has put her in rare territory in which she has continuously shocked spectators with her impressive performances.
Stone is a two-time winner of the Head of the Charles, taking the first-place position for the Senior-Veteran Singles Women Division each time. Her back-to-back victories in 1997 and 1998 were the first two years in which the division existed. Last year, she came in second place behind 81-year-old Eve Green.
“I came up before hardly any women were in my category,” Stone said. “Then all groups of women started going out more and rowing.”
Stone’s rowing career extends past this one weekend in October, and her success follows close behind.
“I have a lot of medals in my basket,” she chuckled. “Some are more important to me than others, especially my two from the Head of the Charles.”
For many people, it’s not just Stone’s age that is surprising, but also her experience—or lack thereof. She started rowing at the ripe age of 65, when she retired from the Cardiac Blood Lab at Stanford Hospital.
Stone got interested in rowing almost by happenstance one day over 20 years ago, when she read an article in The San Francisco Chronicle about the Open Water Rowing Center (OWRC) in Sausalito, Calif. It might have been the sunny and warm weather of January or the first two lessons she took on the San Francisco Bay, but soon she saw her visits become far more regular.
“I found that if I wanted to be a good rower, I really had to put in the time,” Stone said. “I now had time to do that, and I would go three times a week.”
For the most part, Stone enjoys rowing leisurely, but she admits that she became pretty competitive once she picked it up. In her past, she was a member of an international group of women rowers. She also won herself a trip to Boston for the famous C.R.A.S.H.-B World Indoor Rowing Competition by qualifying “by accident” at a similar event at her boat club in San Francisco.
Stone’s involvement with the rowing community of her home in northern California has only grown, as she now works part-time as an equipment manager at OWRC. She is all-hands-on-deck, putting skates back in when they get knocked out by rocks, fixing oarlocks, and even offering unsolicited yet valuable rowing advice to younger members.
“Her experience running the lab has led her to have great skill looking after the equipment,” said long-time friend and fellow rower, Ellen Braithwaite.
“It’s all sort of problem solving, and that’s a fun thing to do,” Stone said.
Braithwaite and Stone met in the mid-1990s at the Craftsbury Outdoor Center, where groups of adults were united through programs and camps directed toward outdoor sports. Their camaraderie on and off the water grew from there, and they will both be on the Charles this weekend.
“It is a pleasure to row with [Stone],” Braithwaite said. “She still has the beautiful rhythm and grace of the rowing stroke. And she has a very feisty, competitive spirit.”
Stone’s success doesn’t come from endless hours of training as much as natural talent and determination. Her schedule of working at OWRC two days a week, and its location an hour away from her home in Palo Alto, limits her ability to get on the water and practice.
“I haven’t had as much time on the water this year as I would have liked,” she said. “In the summertime, the fog and wind comes into the San Francisco Bay, so not every day was right for rowing. I have been out the last four weekends getting my stroke all lined up.”
Though Stone has traditionally relied on others for advice on the water, recently her guidance has spread to technology through the Apple application, “Coach’s Eye,” that comes on her iPad while she skulls. While she is in the Boston area, the Cambridge Rowing Club takes her in, lets her train, and even lends her a boat.
What guides her on race day, however, are the voices and cheers from above.
“Support on the shore from fellow rowers and spectators are the true inspiration,” Stone said. “They look down from that bridge and they yell, ‘Hey Mary Liz!’ and it means a lot.”
In addition to the support she receives, Stone keeps coming back for her love of the sport. Back home at the OWRC, she admits there never is a dull day.
Wadsworth Stone traces his sister’s love for rowing back to their father, who was on the Columbia crew team. Braithwaite believes it has more to do with her raw determination.
“She wants to keep on being an alive and vital person,” Braithwaite said. “A lot of older people come to give up when they meet adversity that comes with aging, but she just keeps on going. It’s part of what keeps her alive.”
Whatever may be the motivation, Stone continues to impress everyone she meets with her fearless dedication and strength.
“She is just a great inspiration to a lot of us,” Braithwaite said. “Her generosity is also something that needs to be admired because she is always willing to help people and make their experience on the water better.”

“Three-peat.”
That is the word that the Harvard men’s lightweight crew team has carried with it since the close of last year’s season.
For the past two years, the Crimson has completed back-to-back undefeated seasons with successive gold medals at EARC Sprints and IRA National Championships. This season, Harvard has the opportunity to add to its winning streak, but unlike the past two years, the team will be under new leadership.
After the passing of longtime heavyweight crew coach Harry Parker, former lightweight coach Charley Butt was moved into the position of heavyweight coach, while Radcliffe women’s lightweight coach Michiel Bartman was called upon to fill the coaching void on the men’s lightweight team.
“The transition has been pretty smooth,” Bartman said. “I had to figure out the squad size, everyone’s names, and how the guys are rowing. That took a little bit of time but now everything is running smoothly.”
Because of the back-to-back undefeated seasons and high expectations for this year, stepping into the new role could have been daunting, but Bartman has not been fazed by the pressure.
“It’s always on the back of my mind…but I don’t sleep less knowing that they have been undefeated for the past two years,” Bartman said. “Our goal is to continue the success that they have [had]…and to keep maintaining the high level of work that has been put in in the past.”
With a roster composed of mostly juniors and seniors, the Crimson has the experience to bring another championship back to Cambridge. But for junior Alexander Bonorris, it is important to train the next generation of rowers in order to ensure the team remains competitive for years to come. Bonorris joined the team as a sophomore and was taken in by the upperclass leaders of the team, and he plans to do the same for this year’s newcomers.
“I want to make sure that everyone that passes through a boat on our team is able to fulfill their own personal goals, and [that] we set up an environment where everyone can improve as much as they want, and everybody can fully maximize what they’re doing for the sport,” Bonorris said.
HEAVYWEIGHTS
For the Crimson men’s heavyweight crew team, this season is all about making adjustments.
This year will be the first time in 52 years in which Parker has not coached the heavyweight squad.
“There’s still a huge void,” senior JP Hogan said. “We’re the first Harvard oarsmen who haven’t had Harry as our coach in over half a century, which is a wild thing, so this is a history-making year.”
Although this is Butt’s first year as a heavyweight coach, he brings much experience to the team, having spent the past 28 years as the Crimson men’s lightweight crew coach.
“I’m looking forward to continuing to be able to work with Harvard students,” Butt said. “I feel like it is my mission to carry on the tradition that is a very competitive, ready-to-race-every-weekend kind of team.”
Harvard will look to improve upon its IRA National Championship finish last year, in which the first varsity team placed second and the team placed fourth overall.
“[The] University of Washington has won every single year for about the last seven years, and we have been finishing behind them each of those years, so there is very much a feeling that we want to beat them,” Hogan said. “It seems like they are going to be a little weaker this year and we’re getting stronger…so this is our opportunity to [beat Washington].”
But for a team that is accustomed to Parker’s non-confrontational approach, Butt’s leadership style has taken some getting used to.
“It’s a complete 180 from Harry’s coaching style, but in a good way,” Hogan said. “Charley is more technical, hands-on, and all about small boats, so there is a constant stream of coaching and feedback that we didn’t have when Harry coached.”
While transitioning from one style of rowing to another, Butt noted that he still places an emphasis on the basics of rowing, and he hopes that foundation will allow the team to remain atop the crew standings throughout the season.
“We have spent a lot of time on connecting to the water and how to accelerate the boat properly—two things that are easily said but much harder to do in practice,” Butt said. “I feel this is a very strong team and we have a real chance of being a strong group. However, the work from one year has to be put out the next year, otherwise [success] doesn’t happen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After finishing last spring with top national rankings, the Radcliffe heavyweight and lightweight crew teams returned to the water Oct. 5-6 to kick off their fall campaigns. Several boats from both squads competed in the Head of the Genesee Regatta in Rochester, N.Y., placing second and third, respectively, while other boats raced in the Textile River Regatta in Lowell, Mass.
Both teams will now compete in the famed Head of the Charles Regatta this weekend. This regatta will pit them against some of the toughest competition of the fall racing season and provide a barometer of their prospects for the longer spring season.
HEAVYWEIGHTS
The heavyweight Black and White has spent the last two weeks preparing for the Head of the Charles, where it will enter three boats of eight and one four.
“Our performance in our 5K was promising [at Head of the Genesee],” co-captain Katie Wilcox said. “It’s always nice to have a race before Head of the Charles because it’s a wakeup call. We had time to hit the ground running for two weeks, gain more fitness, and work on meshing together.”
This weekend, two boats will compete in the Championship Eight category, while the four will compete in the Championship Four category, and another eight will race in the Club Eight category. The Club Eight race has strict criteria to ensure that its competitors have a similar level of experience, typically requiring a team comprised of freshmen.
“In our first race, we saw a very competitive nature and an excitement and a fire that we’re going to continue to foster,” co-captain Kelly Bauer said. “But the Head of the Charles brings competitors from all over the world. It’s great to have the whole city come out and line the river and watch us race. ”
The seniors are eagerly anticipating their final Head of the Charles rowing for Radcliffe and plan to expend all their effort on the water.
“We practice the course all the time; we know every landmark along the river,” Wilcox said. “We have the local community support, and we have our friends from the rowing community that are coming from across the country to row here.... We’re looking to push this team to a level of success that we haven’t seen before.”
LIGHTWEIGHTS
Using an intense cadence and rhythm, the top lightweight boat placed third in the Head of the Genesee, just behind its heavyweight counterpart. It plans to use this same strategy to compete in their Head of the Charles races.
“We kept it together throughout the race and held our technique and power,” co-captain Elizabeth Lenczowski said. “We kept pushing the rate up throughout the piece, which is what we’re looking to do [this weekend]. Our coxswain called the piece as if we were racing Head of the Charles, so that was helpful to imagine how we’re going to go about attacking the race.”
Although the first varsity eight crew placed second at the IRA National Championship last spring, Lenczowski was not satisfied by the group’s finish.
“I think our performance really left us hungry for more,” Lenczowski said. “We’re looking forward to the challenge of topping that, and we’re all really motivated to work hard toward a gold medal at the IRA’s this year. Our race in England [at the Women’s Henley Regatta] this summer gave us the chance to race a lot of fast crews internationally, but we all came back ready to train hard and win a championship this year.”
The lightweights face an unexpected challenge due to coaching changes created by the loss of longtime heavyweight men’s coach Harry Parker, who passed away in June, and was replaced by Charley Butt, the former head coach of the men’s lightweight team. Former Radcliffe head coach Michiel Bartman moved to the men’s lightweight team to fill the spot vacated by Butt, leaving the women’s lightweight crew with just an assistant coach.
Last Friday, Elizabeth ‘Lou’ Berl was hired as the new lightweight coach, coming from Davidson, N.C., where she most recently started Lou’s Garage Crew, a program designed to train young competitive rowers. Prior to arriving in Cambridge, Berl coached at Trinity College in Hartford, Conn., as well as at the University of Virginia and the Ohio State University.
With no head coach named for the first part of their training this season, the rowers looked to one another for support.
“The coaching changes have some impact on the team’s performance and culture, but ultimately it’s the rowers themselves that dictate the success of the team,” Lenczowski said. “We [used] this transition as an opportunity to step up ourselves and see what we [could] accomplish working together.”
Assistant coach Lauren Fisher has led the girls so far this season, along with a few volunteer assistant coaches and women’s heavyweight head coach Liz O’Leary.
“We’re sticking with the same goals that we’ve had in the past, and we’re working with a similar training plan,” Fisher said. “They’re doing a really good job of being able to continue to move on and meet their goals....Their times are actually faster than their times were at this point last year.”
This weekend, the lightweight team will enter three boats, competing in the Women’s Championship Eight and the Women’s Lightweight Fours. Fisher hopes for a repeat of the first eight’s first-place performance last year and expects solid performances from her other two boats as well.
“Head of the Charles is definitely the most important race for us in the fall,” Fisher said.
In preparing for the race, Lenczowski remembers the advice of her former coach.
“It’s great to be able to do well at Head of the Charles, but ultimately it doesn’t mean you’ll win at the IRA’s,” Lenczowski said.

First off, you should go. Otherwise, you are making the biggest mistake of your existence. It doesn’t matter how much (or how little) you know about rowing. Whether you’re a rowing snob or haven’t so much as sat on an erg (that’s a rowing machine, landlubbers), you should go. There is something incredibly exciting and energizing about most regattas, but the Charles is the one that even the best rowers have dreams about.
Now that you’ve decided to go, you need to make sure you get a good view. One of the best viewing spots is the BU Bridge—but since everyone knows this, you must arrive early (unless you’re the same height as one of the heavyweight men). Just remember: no pushing, or you’ll end up taking a swim. There are people who take the HOC even more seriously than the rowers do.
But why, asks the casual observer, should one care about the view enough to risk your life? Here's why: these are some of the best rowers in the world—nay, the universe. They are lean, mean, well-oiled rowing machines, perfectly timed at the catch and exuding power in every stroke. You will probably never in your life look so good doing anything—go forth and worship them.
Most important of all, the winning teams throw their coxswains (small, fierce men and women charged with steering the boat and “motivating” the rowers) into the water in celebration. You know you have a masochistic streak—I mean, you know you want to share in their joy. Unfortunately, wet spandex is no less opaque than dry—sorry, guys.

This week, Buzzfeed came out with a list of “19 Things You Can’t Say Without Sounding Like A Tool,” and, surprise, surprise, “I go to Harvard” made it. Flyby came up with 10 additional oh-so-typical Harvard phrases that make you sound like even more of a tool among tools.
 
1. “The curve for this class is so rough. I’m probably going to end up with an A-." Oh, because attending such a prestigious University means you’re entitled to an A.
 
2. “My TF is okay, but my CA for that class is definitely the best." Because we’re apparently too good for teaching assistants.
 3. “But it’s all the way in the Quad." We Harvard students should never have to suffer through a 10- or 15-minute walk. 
 
4. “I’m probably in the background of at least 80 tourist photos." They should be so lucky.
 
5. “Do they really think I’m trying to steal a book from Lamont in my 13-inch laptop case?" Because you’d be saving the world with your intelligence in the 10 seconds it takes you to open it.
 
6. “I’m concentrating in economics with a secondary in CS." Majors and minors are for lowly universities such as Yale and Stanford.
 
7. “I got punched by the Phoenix." Now you can tell all your friends that you were in “The Social Network.”
 
8. “I hate telling people I go to Harvard." It must be such a burden bragging to people that you go to a world-renowned school.
 
9. “At least we don’t go to Yale." At least you didn’t get in.
 10. “When my dad went here…" Commentary unnecessary.
 
To protect the author's privacy, the Admissions Blog has granted her anonymity for this series. Read Part I, Part II, and Part III. 
I first attempted the Common Application essay one August evening at the end of the summer. I was staying with my father at a family friend’s house for the night. I reclined in an unfamiliar chair and tried to think about what I wanted to say to the world (or, barring that, the Brown admissions committee).
 
I thought back to my past two summers spent out west on Native American reservations. I’d done everything from construction work to running a day camp as part of two travel-and-service trips. I’d spent weekends at powwows and sweat lodges, seen Rushmore in the rain, and swum in glacier lakes. These two summers had been formative and exciting beyond my wildest expectations, but how could I convey that?
  
My writing was stilted, awkward, and unnatural. I struggled to convey the wide skies, the abject poverty, and my own personal renaissance all in 500 words or less. Here was first story I told: When I had visited Rushmore, I already knew its whole sad history. Located in the Black Hills of western South Dakota, the mountain had been a holy site for the Lakota Sioux Indians. As I walked up to the monument, I knew exactly what I was seeing behind its patriotic visage. But the next summer in Montana, I spent a weekend backpacking in Glacial National Park, unaware of its similar history of land seizure and injustice. I tried to juxtapose these two scenarios, showing how, though I knew about some injustices, there was a nearly infinite history of other wrongdoings still to uncover. “Preachy,” unfortunately, was not something I could pull off.
 
“I told myself I would never be as naïve and insensitive as the tourists I saw at Rushmore, who celebrated the national monument unaware of its true history. Little did I know how much I had to learn about injustice… At Glacier National Park, I learned that the truth often is much more hidden and difficult to discern than it initially appears. Equality and democracy are ideals that many people are excluded from sharing, and they only will become realities when we take it upon ourselves to make them meaningful for everyone.”
 
I handed my computer to my dad. He read it over. “Try to be natural,” he said. “Write something that comes easily. This doesn’t sound a thing like you!”
 
I tried again. This time, instead of trying to teach the admissions committee a lesson, I decided to take them into the world I’d seen. I had participated in about five sweat lodges, each one as physically demanding as the last. Could I convey what it was like to be enclosed in that dark circle? The words came quickly.
 
“Sweat poured down my face as I tried not to hyperventilate. Never comfortable in small spaces, I was having a hard time maintaining my composure in the sweat lodge. As a glowing rock cracked down the middle, another inescapable wave of heat rolled towards me. Except for the faint light from the rocks, I was enveloped in thick darkness. I pressed my towel to my face, which now felt like it had been submerged under water for hours. There was no way out.”
 
I went on to describe the pseudo-spiritual awakening I’d had, which may have been heat-induced hallucination—or perhaps the first truly religious experience of my life.
 
“I was still aware of the heat, but instead of flaying me alive, it seemed to encircle my body supportively. I saw lights before my eyes, though there were none in the lodge. It occurred to me that I was probably hallucinating—but then I realized it was possible my prayers were being heard. Is this what praying really was?”
 
It was risky. I was no authority on religion and thought the experience might sound hokey rendered in my words. But the words were flying off my fingertips; at least according to my dad, I was doing something right. I made sure to include reflection as well in description:
 
“I realized I had overcome my fears and inhibitions.  But more than that, I felt like something profound had happened. This experience, which was completely foreign to me in every way, actually had given me a moment of deep spiritual awareness. And I never would have felt it if I hadn’t taken a risk.”
 
And then I was done. I would edit and tweak over the next two months before Brown’s early decision deadline, but my thoughts were coherent and my ideas permanent. I refashioned my first essay to fit Brown’s supplemental essay: “What don’t you know?” With my mother’s help, I decreased the preaching and increased the self-reflection. It wasn’t perfect, but it would do. I submitted my early decision application with a few hours to spare. It was time to wait—but first, time to write the rest of my applications.
