After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Somewhere in America, sweat will drop from the brow of a father as he works tirelessly under the blistering sun. A mother will stand on her feet for hours without rest. Elsewhere, a 17-year-old high school senior with a 4.0 GPA, knowing no home but the United States, will not qualify for the scholarship she needs to afford the college of her dreams.
These are the real, human stories of undocumented immigrants—stories that are lost in the minds of too many Americans. Rather than viewing immigrants as human beings first, we condemn them as “illegal” and even as “aliens.”
The fundamental problem with how we discuss immigration in this country is that too often the conversation begins and ends with the false notion that 11 million lawbreakers have entered this country through the U.S.-Mexican border. In framing immigration this way, this nation is not only unable to effectively address the issue, but we have also turned 11 million human beings into faceless objects of denigration.
If we really want to address immigration in this country, let’s acknowledge one fact: Our immigration system is broken. In November 2014, nearly 4.3 million people were on the wait list for family-based visas. Over 100,000 others were waiting for employment-based visas. In our system, it is not uncommon for those seeking citizenship to face waiting times as long as 24 years.
The vast majority of those who are undocumented in the United States came to this country seeking to build a better life in an honest way. If you are an American citizen and you are not a Native American, it is likely that not long ago someone in your family came to this country seeking a better life too.
We are a nation of immigrants.
That is why it is unacceptable for any of us in this country to treat undocumented immigrants as a monolith of criminals. Whether someone is here because she crossed a border or because she stayed on an expired visa, the focus of our indictment should be on the broken system itself.
Fixing this system means making many of the changes that President Obama has been calling on Congress to make for years. This includes restructuring the visa process in a way that reduces government costs and improves services. It means ensuring that the government issues all of the immigrant visas that Congress accounts for every year, consistent with demand. And it means providing a fair path to earned citizenship for those who are undocumented and already waiting in line.
Some Americans do not support a path to earned citizenship for undocumented immigrants because they believe that most undocumented immigrants are violent and stealing jobs from native-born citizens. This is simply not true.
Studies dating back more than a century reveal that immigrants, regardless of nationality or legal status, are less likely than the native population to commit violent crimes. Those who continue to make generalizations about all undocumented immigrants based on individual cases of violent crimes involving undocumented immigrants are misinformed. In fact, such rhetoric only upholds a form of prejudice that is no better than judging an entire race or religion based on the actions of a small group of people.
It is likewise misguided to blame undocumented immigrants for our country’s economic woes. The U.S. jobs market is not a zero-sum game between those born within and those born outside our borders. Because immigrants tend to have a different set of skills from native-born workers, most immigrants are not competing for the same jobs as native-born Americans. Deporting eight million undocumented workers today would not open up eight million jobs for U.S. citizens tomorrow.
The reality is that providing a path to citizenship for millions of hard working people would actually boost our economy significantly. Under a plan that would provide legal status today and citizenship in five years to undocumented workers, the impact over a 10-year period would cumulatively increase our GDP by $1.1 trillion, increase the incomes of Americans by $618 billion, create 159,000 jobs per year, and increase tax revenue by $144 billion.
Nobel laureate and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel once said, “No human being is illegal.” These are the wise words that should be guiding the immigration debate today. The 11 million undocumented people of this country are not faceless. They are our classmates, our neighbors, our parents, and our children—and they deserve a path to citizenship.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear Andy,
Wow, it’s been a while since we last spoke. I’m about to start my junior year—can you believe that? It still seems like yesterday that you and I met through South Boston Afterschool.
On the T-ride to South Boston, we talked in Chinese (I had just started; you helped me with my tones). We talked about girls (we talked a lot about girls). And sometimes we talked about more serious things. About how we were so afraid to fail, about how we constantly felt pulled in all directions. About how hopeless we felt.
When you quit South Boston Afterschool, I just figured it was a sophomore slump. Maybe your economics tutorial was taking up too much of your time, or maybe you were working on a new start-up, trying to be the next Mark Zuckerberg. You were stressed out the last time I saw you. I wasn’t too worried, though. I thought what everyone else here thinks: Junior year will be better than sophomore year. Senior year might be a bit tougher because of job searching, but you’ll be set after that. You’ll be a Harvard grad the rest of your life.
But then you jumped off a tower in downtown Boston. I thought wrong.
Andy, I spent a long time trying to figure out how to write this letter. It’s been on my mind every single day now for months. I almost gave up, because the words just wouldn’t come to me. It was too painful to express.
Then, in May, my best friend since we were babies ended his own life. He had just gotten into Georgia Tech. He had so much talent. He had such an incredible life ahead of him. His mom found his body. They couldn’t show it at the service.
His death inspired me to write this to you. Because it’s not just him, and it’s not just you.
Writing this next part terrifies me, Andy. I’m scared because we live in a world where I can’t even write this letter without knowing in my heart that no matter what people will say, they will look at me differently. I want to make a big impact after I graduate, but I know that publicly discussing my complicated history with mental health—a conversation that should not be any more damning than talking about asthma or a heart condition—might prevent me from doing this. But that is exactly why I have to write this letter. It is time for us to reconcile with the reality of the world that we live in. It is time for me to say now what I should have told you before: You are not alone.
I should have told you about fifth grade, when I would stay up every single night thinking terrible thoughts. I had to make sure once, twice, three, four, five times that our doors and windows were locked, because I had to be sure. I had to know that no one would come in and slit my parents’ throats, and then beat my head in with a baseball bat.
I should have told you about sixth grade, when I touched flowers, and leaves, and people’s hair. My classmates did not understand, so they signed a petition asking me to stop. They gave it to the teacher, who presented it to me. Even today I remember the hurt and shame I felt when I saw the names of so many friends written on that piece of paper. They didn’t know that I could not help it; they did not know that it was outside of my control.
I should have told you about seventh grade, when germs consumed me. Bacteria crawled all over my body and inside my mouth. I would go to the bathroom repeatedly in the middle of class to frantically rinse my mouth and scrub my hands. When my best friend sneezed on me to see my reaction, and another spat in my juice and forced me to drink it, and another threw meat at me because she knew I was a vegetarian. I wondered if I had any friends at all. Maybe they were just pretending to like me because I was so funny to watch. I felt worthless; I felt hopeless; I felt powerless. I felt like I didn’t deserve to live.
But more important than any of that, Andy, I should have told you about how finally enough was enough. My mom got me help. She got me help, even when my teacher asked, “Why does he need therapy? He makes all A’s—he’ll be fine.” My mom replied, “I will be sure to write on his tombstone that he had all A’s after he kills himself because he hates his brain.” She knew what too few understand, that objective achievement means very little when life is nothing but shame and darkness.
Because of her intervention, I acquired tools to deal with my compulsions, to say “It Don’t Matter” until it really did not matter. Overcoming my compulsions was the hardest thing I’ve ever done, but it was worth it. I’m here today Andy, writing this letter to you, because my mom got me help.
Andy, I am sorry that I never told you about my middle school self. And I am sorry that I never told you how therapy empowered me to reclaim the beauty in life.
But I hope this letter to you will help change things for others. I hope it will convince someone who is like me all those years ago to find the support that they need. I hope it will encourage someone like me now—too busy with their midterms, their finals, and their papers—to check in on a friend. I hope it will encourage us as a community to fight against the stigma surrounding mental health issues both in our college and in our nation. And most of all, I am sorry that we live in a society where we could not talk openly to each other.
I miss you more than you can know, Andy. By relating this story—of what I did wrong with you, and what my mom did right with me—I want us to make a difference in the world. Then I will know that I am doing your memory proud.
Will

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every new school year brings with it a plethora of changes; this year is no different, as Harvard has unveiled a brand new my.harvard web portal. A wide range of student information—about academics and other aspects of student life—has now been consolidated in a new iteration of the familiar website, one is much more user-friendly than its predecessor.
The new my.harvard contains resources for students, faculty, and advisors alike. College students have easy access to their enrollment tools, registration information, grades, tuition balance, advising network, and key University documents—all located in one place. The improvements to the ease of use of the new my.harvard portal have been accompanied by corresponding aesthetic enhancements made it much easier to look at. The new my.harvard’s launch has even gone off without a hitch, a truly rare occurrence in the modern world of new technologies. In short, the new system is certainly a better version of its precursor.
Increased efficiency might come with some tradeoffs, however. The many cosmetic updates to my.harvard have overshadowed an important substantive change: Students will no longer hand in hard copies of their study cards, but rather submit electronic versions. Though this sounds like a “minor logistical difference,” as the administration has described it, in reality it is much more than a simple technological update.
Under the old system, advisors signed off on a study card to give their stamp of approval to a particular set of courses. In the new system, an advisor lifts an “advising hold” on a student that gives the student permission to enroll in any course. This raises a number of questions. Students will consult with their advisors about potential courses to shop, but after that conversation, can they choose entirely different classes on their own and submit them to the registrar without their advisor seeing the final course lineup?
Submitting study cards electronically for approval instead of spending Study Card Day running around campus to track down instructors is a welcome change, and a fitting way to bring study cards into the 21st century. But it would be a shame to see the role of academic advisor reduced from helping a student plan a successful course load each semester to having one non-binding conversation per semester with each advisee.
The new my.harvard does make things better; students and faculty alike will benefit from the effort to modernize administrative systems, increase their efficiency, and eliminate burdensome paperwork for everyone. But it may also weaken the incentive for students to have close relationships with their advisors, which will inevitably—in a very busy environment—weaken the advising relationship itself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mather House piloted an orientation program for their sophomore residents this past weekend, allowing them to move into their dorm rooms a day early in an effort to make House life more central to their extracurricular lives.
Starting on Friday, Mather sophomores participated in team building exercises and workshops led by House advisers. They were also placed into small groups meant to connect them with peers outside their blocking and existing friend groups. Just over 80 percent of sophomores in the House participated, according to Mather House co-master Michael D. Rosengarten. 
In addition to a traditional sophomore adviser, sophomores were for the first time also assigned a “House advising peer” who is either an upperclassman or recent graduate of the House.
Rosengarten said Mather launched the pilot program in the hopes of fostering more community among House residents—a College-wide goal that Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, who is also the co-master of Cabot House, has pushed publicly since he became dean last year.
In Mather, students say they often leave the House without meeting all their peers there, Rosengarten said.
“Most [of] the students we’ve talked to said, in their senior year, the maximum amount of people they know in the House is 30 people out of 400 people,” Rosengarten said. “The idea is perhaps there are a lot of barriers in the House we could lower and make the experience better.”
The exercises and advisers, Mather administrators hope, will make the sophomore community more integrated now that they have moved in.
“We’re not sure that we have all the answers, but what we’re looking for are exercises that will break down barriers and help people connect with each other,” Rosengarten said.
Trevor A. Mullin ’17, Mather House Committee’s Secretary and a House advising peer, said transitioning to upperclassman life and a move from freshman dorms to the House system comes with difficulties, given differences in how entryways function and the smaller size of dining halls. But prior to the orientation, he was optimistic about the prospects of the program.
“I think it will introduce sophomores to more people earlier and create a more inclusive community,” Mullins said.
Mather sophomore and orientation attendee Leesa C. Quinlan ’18 praised the House’s community building goals.
“There’s a really great opportunity to become a family, to get to know people, to learn people’s last names and not just their first names,” Quinlan said.
According to Rosengarten, after the program, sophomores will fill out a survey about their experience and the general transition to upperclassman life. Administrators will then compare the responses of Mather residents’ responses with 20 randomly selected sophomores from three other Houses to assess the program’s success. From there, the College may expand the program to other Houses.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Reiterating his focus on individual growth, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana again promoted his vision of Harvard College as a place that should spur “transformation” in the Convocation ceremony Tuesday afternoon.
From his self-deprecating humor—“It’s easier to become Dean than it is to get into the College, and I am so, you know, over that”—to emphasis on “transformation,” Khurana delivered a speech to freshmen almost wholly similar to his speech at last year’s Convocation. 
As he did last Convocation, Khurana referenced his daughter, now one year older, to describe perceived ills in the college admissions process and the culture he believes it fosters. Rather than viewing their College experience as one focused on acquiring the highest grades or landing the most prestigious job, Khurana called on freshmen to challenge and discover themselves.
“You may feel that you’re expected to do high school all over again, to jump through another set of hoops and prove yourself,” Khurana said. “You don’t [have to]. You are already admitted to Harvard.”
Referencing a distinction he has often outlined since he became Dean of the College a year ago, Khurana cautioned undergraduates against viewing their four year experience as “transactional” and taking calculated but risk-averse steps to score high grades and achieve material ends. Instead, Khurana reemphasized a word that has almost become the unofficial brand of his deanship: transformation. Subdivided into three categories—personal, social, and intellectual—Khurana said a "transformative" experience involves self reflecting, befriending those who are unlike you, and enrolling in courses out of interest for learning, not marks.
Without these goals in mind, Khurana said, undergraduates may finish their experiences with “with a degree, but not a Harvard College education,” Khurana said.
In a separate speech, Jonathan G. Jeffrey ’16, a member of the Honor Council and co-chair of Mather House Committee, continued a theme of personal reflection, arguing, like Khurana, that freshmen should not feel compelled to prove their worthiness of studying or excelling at the College.
“I wanted to have a resume, a transcript, and an image that left no doubt in the minds of those around me that I belonged at Harvard,” Jeffrey said, recounting his freshman year. Referencing the College’s new honor code, Jeffery later added that by focusing on personal integrity in making academic and social decisions, students might achieve what he called a “personally transformative experience.”
Other speakers, including University President Drew G. Faust and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith, offered their own advice to freshmen. While Faust encouraged the assembled undergraduates to surprise themselves, Smith, as he has in previous years, reiterated a motto of “don’t compare, connect.”
At the end of the ceremony, Undergraduate Council President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 unfurled the crimson-colored Class of 2019 banner. As Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 called off each freshman dorm individually, the undergraduates, many with hair slicked back and donning formal attire, belted cheers and later processed to Widener steps for their annual photograph.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Known for its walkthrough suites and accommodations widely regarded as lackluster, Dunster House had been an undergraduate favorite for ridicule. But with the construction trucks gone from Cowperthwaite Street, the College’s first fully renovated House opened its doors to students last weekend.
Among changes made during the nearly 15-month long construction process were the addition of a wheelchair accessible main entrance with twin pillars, a new roof, new chimneys, and an emergency generator. Additionally, all parts of the House can now be accessed without ever leaving the building. 
What used to be a first floor student suite looking out onto Dunster’s yard is now a common space that can be used for studying and faculty dinners. Other meeting rooms, with large monitors and sliding whiteboards, are located on the first floor, which also hosts several archival black and white photographs of the House, as well as recycled wood paneling.
Dunster is third in the line of College House renovations—a more than $1 billion project, largely funded by Harvard’s ongoing $6.5 billion capital campaign—following the renewal of Quincy House’s Stone Hall in 2013 and Leverett House’s McKinlock Hall in 2014.
Last year, when the College released renovation plans, administrators estimated that the renovations would increase House space for events by 33 percent. During construction, Dunster residents lived in swing housing in and around Harvard Square, including the former Inn at Harvard.
Suites in Dunster now closely resemble their counterparts in renovated Quincy and Leverett, with housing options including hallway singles and six-person suites, all new furniture, hall bathrooms, floor common rooms, and hall printers. The shift to floor common rooms—as opposed to more private common space, a choice some students have criticized—mirrors efforts to add more common spaces on Harvard’s campus, especially with the large scale renovation of the Smith Campus Center that will begin if Harvard receives approval from a local zoning board.
All suites contain windows, ceiling fans, and the infrastructure for air conditioning. Whereas entryways before were organized vertically with tutors often living on different floors than some of their students, entryway residents and their tutors now share the same floor.
The dining hall, a favorite before the renovations, has refinished wood and more electric outlets under each table, a built in sound system, a retractable projector screen, and additional outdoor and indoor seating.
Of the several squash courts that once dominated Dunster’s basement, only one remains. The rest of the basement is now occupied by several new exercise areas, music rooms, an art room, a renovated kitchen, and grille. A new basement “smart” classroom with monitors and glass walls that can effectively serve as whiteboards.
Next in line for House renewal is Winthrop House, which will be renovated from 2016 to 2017 and Lowell House from 2017 to 2018.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School launched this summer the first major redesign of its early curriculum since the 1980s, integrating multiple disciplines into single courses and introducing earlier clinical immersion and flipped classrooms. 
Medical professors who conceived the overhaul of the curriculum, which is called “Pathways” and has been in the works since 2012, say it will require medical students to learn more actively, rather than cram and memorize material, and that it seeks to reflect how medicine has changed over the last 30 years. It focuses on the first two years of medical school, termed “preclerkship,” and is now in effect for the school’s first-year students.
One facet of the redesign involves course content. Under the new curriculum, individual courses now survey multiple topics and disciplines, rather than focus on one area of study, so they are “more integrated,” said Richard M. Schwartzstein, a Medical School professor who chaired the task force on the curriculum redesign.
For example, one course, the “Foundations of Medicine” run by cell biology professor Randall W. King, covers disciplines including pathology, cell biology, and microbiology. Previously, those subjects were taught separately; the new course “takes elements of those old courses and weaves them together,” King said.
The curriculum redesign has also overhauled how Medical School professors teach their students. While Medical School courses were previously run in a traditional lecture format, under the new curriculum, they will use flipped classroom model, in which students watch lectures on video outside of class and then apply the concepts they cover in class and clinic.
To Schwartzstein, this change means that students will no longer be able to succeed through just last-minute studying for exams. It will require more active engagement, he said.
“The notion of cramming for an exam and forgetting shortly afterwards, which many of our students have done in college, will not work for this new curriculum,” Schwartzstein said. “The old method of cram, regurgitate it on the exam, and forget, is not an appropriate way to prepare yourself for a career that will span 30 to 40 years.”
The third major facet of the redesign is a change in when students begin their clinical rotations, or “core clerkships.” Students will now begin clinical rotations 14 months into their time at the school, rather than nearly 18 months, a change professors say means students will now practically apply the skills they learn in the classroom earlier.
“We think this will help motivate students and make them feel like they’re on their way to becoming doctors,” Schwartzstein said. “It will allow them to view correlations between what they’re learning in the classroom and what they’re learning at the bedside.”
“On the structural level what matters is that students are getting more intensive clinical experiences early,” King said.
The new curriculum represents a major change in Harvard’s fundamental approach to medical education, which has remained largely constant for more than two decades, other than a 2006 curriculum change that targeted third-year students.
Technological advances, in particular the advent of the internet, necessitated a change, according to Schwartzstein. Because factual information is now so much more accessible, it can be taught more efficiently than in a classroom lecture, he said.
“The existing curriculum, which has largely been in place since the late 1980s, just was not adequate enough to the way medicine was being practiced and given the technological advances that have occurred over the last 30 years,” Schwartzstein said.
Government policy, too, has changed the field of medicine in the years since Harvard adopted its most recent medical curriculum. Under the new curriculum, students will study recent developments in health care, including the Affordable Care Act, according to Haiden A. Huskamp, a professor in health care policy who co-directs a health policy course.
“There’s been tremendous change in the last few years with the ACA,” Huskamp said. “We want students to understand what the system that they’re going to operate within, what kind of incentives that creates, how it will affect their patients and how it will affect them, and the goal is that we want them to deliver the best care possible to their patients.”
For Huskamp, who has been at the Medical School for just under 20 years, the curriculum change is a push to keep medical education useful and up-to-date.
“Medical practice is changing, the health policy environment is changing; so much has changed,” Huskamp said. “It’s such a dynamic system that we want to make sure that we are teaching in a way that will really empower students when they’re out.”
Bernard S. Chang, a professor on the curriculum redesign task force who is leading the design team in a course on “Mind, Brain Behavior, and Development,” suggested that Harvard needs to respond to that ever-changing nature of the field.
“The pace of change in medical science and practice can be overwhelming at times, and it is our responsibility at HMS to maintain a curriculum that is reflective of this dynamism, responsive to student needs, and centered on patient care skills,” Chang wrote in an email.
The new curriculum is not yet fully finalized, according to Schwartzstein, who said the curriculum redesign task force is still working on specific details for 2016 course material.
According to Schwartzstein, the Medical School received a $200,000 grant from the Harvard Initiative for Learning and Teaching to track the relative success of the new curriculum, to be used over two years. Schwartzstein said the study will examine student experience through surveys and performance evaluations, comparing the first class under the new curriculum and the last class under the old curriculum.

Harvard Management Company has elected two new members to the board of directors responsible for overseeing the investment of the University’s $35.9 billion endowment.
Jeremy C. Stein, a Harvard economics professor and former Federal Reserve board governor, and Joshua S. Friedman ’76, a co-founder of the Los Angeles-based Canyon Partners hedge fund, joined the nine-member HMC board in July.
This year marked a significant changing of the guard at the Management Company during a time when it has been trying to right its lackluster post-recession investment returns record. Harvard statistics professor Stephen Blyth took over as CEO in January and has been tasked with returning HMC to the top of the pack.
“I’m looking forward to it,” Stein said. “I’m a finance person, so it’s inherently interesting to me to be involved with it.”
In another HMC transition, University treasurer and member of the Harvard Corporation Paul J. Finnegan ’75 has taken over as chair of the board. He filled the place of James F. Rothenberg ’68, a longtime Harvard donor and Corporation member who died unexpectedly in July.
“It is an exciting time at HMC,” Finnegan wrote in an email. “A time of new leadership and I look forward to working with and supporting Stephen and the team at HMC in successfully managing the university’s endowment.”
HMC also lost a board member, Robert S. Kaplan, who was recently elected to be president of the Dallas Federal Reserve, a post that required him to step down from the HMC board, which now has 11 members. Finnegan said HMC will likely elect one or two more members to the board—capped at 15 members—in the next six to 12 months.
The Management Company will hold its first quarterly meeting of the 2015-2016 academic year in September.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ registration tool now gives students the option to choose preferred gender pronouns for the first time, a change administrators say is an effort to make students more comfortable with their gender identity.
On the page that typically asks students to write down their gender marker—examples of which include “male,” “female,” and “transgender”—they could also manually write in preferred gender pronouns when they registered this week. Examples on the page included “ze, hir, hirs” and “they, them, theirs.”
FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke said the change, which administrators have discussed for a number of years, was intended to “make students feel more comfortable with their gender identity” at Harvard and ease students’ relationships with faculty and advisers, some of whom will be able to see their pronoun information.
“It’s important when you are writing emails or referring a student to another person in the College, you want to do it the right way,” Burke said.
This year’s rollout of a new student information system made adding a new gender pronoun option much easier, according to Burke. His office worked in consultation with the Harvard Trans* Task Force, the College's Office of BGLTQ Student Life, and various students over the course of implementation.
Students involved in the implementation say they welcome the change as a recognition of the needs of transgender students on campus.
“Before, folks really had to have a personal conversation of pronouns that they prefer,” said Joshua Blecher-Cohen ’16, an intern at the Office of BGLTQ Student Life. “Often times in classes there was no space on the first day of class for folks to make that clear, and so this standardizes it across the board.”
He said the new option will also increase awareness of the different gender pronouns that students might use on Harvard’s campus.
Henri G-D ’16, who preferred not to be identified by last name because of potential job discrimination against transgender people, said professors and advisers typically do not mean to do any harm, but often misgender students, resulting in “awkward conversations.”
“It’s just that they literally don’t have any information, which puts it on the students to explain,” Henri said. That, Henri hopes, will change with the registration tool’s gender pronouns option.
Burke, for his part, likened the change to the option of using a preferred name, instead of a legal name.
The federal government requires Harvard and other universities to ask students whether they are male or female, he added, but not about their preferred gender pronouns. He said he does not know how Harvard will use the gender pronoun information for internal data collection, if at all, though it could be useful for student health services or the student housing office.
Blecher-Cohen said students and Harvard staff alike still will need to be educated more on the use of gender pronouns, but that offering different options is a promising start for including students.
“It’s not a panacea; it doesn't fix everything, but hopefully it spurs the conversation so folks are actively thinking about it for the first time,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After years of planning and a massive cheating scandal, the College’s honor code is now finally in effect, and administrators and students are introducing the policy and the new body that will adjudicate academic dishonesty cases in an attempt to make sure the students it governs are aware of it.
Armed with student ambassadors in matching T-shirts and a new Facebook page, the College is trying to publicize the policy—the first of its kind—amidst its roll out, which included an event during freshman orientation devoted to it. 

With a stated goal of a sparking a culture shift among undergraduates so that they become more committed to integrity in academics and more broadly, the honor code asks students to sign a statement affirming their awareness of the policy.
A new student-faculty body called the Honor Council will adjudicate on cases involving potential academic dishonesty. Previously, the Administrative Board, the College’s primary disciplinary body with no student members, heard cheating cases, but after roughly 125 students were initially implicated in 2012’s Government 1310 cheating investigation, an existing push to create an honor code at the College was expedited. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences approved the policy in 2014.
The varied methods -- online and in person -- administrators used to introduce the honor code to students as they arrived on campus last week for the fall semester indicate that they recognize how large of a change they hope it will represent. Before it was adopted, some faculty members and students were skeptical that students would buy in to the policy in practice.
“The goal is to start kind of effecting a cultural change immediately at Harvard,” said Matthew J. Vegari ’17, one of 12 undergraduate students on the Honor Council.
The College introduced the honor code to the new freshman class before they arrived on campus, asking each member to respond to questions about the policy and the importance of academic integrity as part of their writing placement test. All students were asked to affirm their awareness of the honor code when they registered online for the semester.
Brett Flehinger, the Honor Council’s secretary, said it would make sense to repeat the writing exercise in future years, and argued that it is important for the College to increase students’ engagement with the honor code and academic integrity now that the policy is in place.
“What you’re doing is trying to make that bedrock value more prominent,” Flehinger said. “It’s not about us; it’s about the community picking this up.”
Given the broad ambitions that administrators and students have for the “cultural change” they hope the honor code will spur, administrators were tasked with communicating the new policies as a new class of first-year students arrived on campus.
So far, the College has taken several steps in publicizing the honor code, including student meetings and social media. Michael C. Ranen, freshman resident dean for Ivy Yard and a member of the Honor Council, met with student leaders of pre-orientation programs to brief them on the honor code. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana spoke to incoming students about the policy in Memorial Church last week.
Although a spokesperson said he was unavailable to speak about the honor code’s rollout to reporters in person or over the phone, in an emailed statement, Khurana called the policy “an important part of a dialogue we can all participate in and learn from.”
Prior to freshman move-in, students on the Honor Council arrived on campus in mid-August for their own training, which started last spring, as they prepare to hear their first cases this fall. A few student members of the Council had stayed on campus over the summer as interns.
But while students and administrators say they want to make students excited about, and simply aware of, the honor code, there is tension with the desire to make it feel established and a general understanding that the pace of change can be slow.
Jonathan G. Jeffrey ’16, an undergraduate Honor Council member who also helped shape the policy, said students on the judiciary body are tasked with both hearing cases and communicating the honor code at events for freshmen and in upperclassmen Houses this year.
The Honor Council’s voting membership is as follows:

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The new honor code that College administrators are touting as a cornerstone of students’ education comes three years after an “unprecedented” scandal engulfed the campus in debate over whether Harvard had a cheating problem. It's a legacy of  a controversy most current undergraduates did not even experience.
This fall, three classes of undergraduates arrived on campus with, by and large, no direct experience or memory of the Government 1310 cheating scandal, the College’s largest in recent memory that initially implicated roughly 125 students and ultimately required about 70 to leave campus temporarily. Only current seniors, and some older students who took time off, studied at the College in the midst of the investigation. 
But all undergraduate divisions enter into the requirements of the College’s newest academic integrity policy this year. The culmination of more than four years of crafting, the College’s honor code mandates that undergraduates affirm their awareness of a commitment to “producing academic work of integrity” before enrollment. It also creates a new judiciary board of undergraduates, administrators, and graduate students who will hear academic dishonesty cases going forward.
Coordinated posters and online images about honor lined campus last semester, and administrators and student leaders welcomed freshmen last week with speeches about the new code.
In its roll out, administrators so far have repeatedly emphasized that they hope to prompt a “cultural shift” on campus surrounding academic integrity and consistently present it as an important part of a Harvard College education.
Still, just more than a year ago, faculty members heatedly debated whether the policy was well-crafted or even necessary; students questioned whether their peers would buy in. And some remain skeptical still.
By the time news of a widespread cheating scandal reached campus in late August 2012, some administrators at the College had already started discussing bringing an honor code to Harvard. Expedited by the cheating investigation and its aftermath, the College’s Academic Integrity Committee outlined goals for and later drafted the eventual honor code.
Brett Flehinger, the secretary of the new Honor Council, acknowledges that the cheating scandal in 2012 may have hastened the pace of the honor code’s formation. Still, he says research supporting the policy goes back further.
“Gov 1310 is maybe at most a sort of catalyst, but really the research that is the basis of this has been coming out for 20 years,” Flehinger said. “If this is a response to Gov 1310, this is too slow.”
The honor code’s eventual approval in 2014 came after debate among faculty members about its affirmation of integrity statement and how often students would have to sign it. At a faculty meeting in April 2014, some professors peppered Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris with concerns that the requiring students to affirm their integrity too often may have an adverse effect.
Eventually, this past April, the Faculty approved legislation requiring that students affirm their awareness of the honor code prior to course enrollment and before final exams and projects, including theses, and other assignments at the discretion of individual professors. Still, late in the spring, some undergraduates voiced concerns about the affirmation at a student-faculty panel, with Henry Burnam ’16 deeming the affirmation “very dangerous.”
Still, on schedule, incoming freshmen reflected on their personal understandings of honor at the College in their writing placement tests this past spring. Harvard College’s first honor code is now in effect.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After winning the Ivy League title last season, the Harvard women’s soccer team looked to regain momentum in its first contest of the 2015 season. It did just that.
Senior defender Brooke Dickens’ goal in the 71st minute lifted the Crimson to a 1-0 victory over Army on Sunday. Junior goalkeeper Lizzie Durack pitched a shutout in net, stopping all four Black Knight shots she faced.
“Everyone is really itching to play,” Durack said. “Preseason is this big climactic buildup. To finally be able to go out and put on the real jersey, sing the national anthem, and be out there as a team, it’s a very exciting feeling.”
Army (2-2) was playing its fourth game of the season and second home contest of the weekend while Harvard (1-0) wrapped up its preseason earlier in the week and was seeing in its first game action since a 7-0 loss to UCLA in the second round of the NCAA Tournament last November.
“It showed us that this season is going to be challenging,” Dickens said. “Every team we face is going to be difficult. It’s really awesome to play a tough-minded team like Army. That helped us physically to be able to know how to compete against a team that’s tough like that but also mentally prepare for how we need to break down teams.”
The Black Knights’ physical play was evident from the very get-go, as Army controlled the ball and outshot Harvard 5-1 in the game’s early minutes.
“I think the whole team and the coaches agree we didn’t play as well as we can,” Durack said. “We matched up physically pretty well, but I think we have a lot of things to improve on. It’s definitely a good start and there’s definitely a lot of talented players on the team.”
But junior forward Midge Purce shifted the momentum in the Crimson’s direction entering halftime, jumpstarting the offense with three shots in the final ten minutes of the half. Harvard would open the latter half quickly with four shots, putting pressure on the Black Knights’ defense.
After forcing a corner kick, co-captain Haley Washburn placed her cross in front of the Black Knights’ net. Dickens struck the ball once before a carom sent it back to her. This time she made sure to get more foot on it, sending the ball just below the crossbar and the Crimson to a 1-0 lead it would not relinquish.
“It’s really exciting to score as a defender,” Dickens said. “I was in the right place at the right time. It was definitely a team effort goal.”
Before the final horn, Army took three more shots and had two opportunities on corner kicks but nothing got past Durack. The Sydney native picked up her fourth career shutout in what will most likely be her first season as the Crimson’s full-time goalie. Dickens’ goal was the fourth of her Harvard career. Purce led all players with seven shots and four shots on goal.
“We have a lot to work on still, but we played well together as a team,” Dickens said. “Army is very strong mentally and physically, so coming out, we knew we had a tough opponent. Moving forward, we have a better grip on how we need to improve.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 3, 2015, at 11:16 a.m.
With two months to go before its first game, the Harvard men’s basketball team may have already suffered its worst loss of the season. The team announced Wednesday morning that three-year starter and captain Siyani Chambers will take a voluntary leave of absence from Harvard College after sustaining a torn ACL during summer workouts.
Described repeatedly by coach Tommy Amaker as the team’s “most important player” over the last three years, Chambers has finished either first or second in the Ivy League in assists in each season he has played. He was named Ivy League Rookie of the Year as a freshman, making the All-Ivy League First Team after filling a leadership void left by the departed Brandyn Curry ’13-’14 and Kyle Curry ’13-’14 on a team with just one senior in the rotation.
Chambers, who is expected to return to the team for the 2016-2017 school year, leaves with no obvious backup. Nominal backup point guard Alex Nesbitt '15 was injured last year and has since graduated, while junior Corbin Miller and sophomore Andre Chatfield functioned more as spot-up shooters than primary ball-handlers. Junior Matt Fraschilla and freshman Tommy McCarthy, a three-star recruit from Carlsbad, California, will also be in the mix for the starting job.
The team, which already faced an uphill battle to its fifth consecutive Ivy League championship after losing three of its top six players to graduation, sees its championship hopes sink. The loss of Chambers takes the Crimson from being arguably the league’s strongest team to the middle of the pack.
The stats back up the bleak forecast: the only two returning starters from last year, senior Agunwa Okolie and junior Zena Edosomwan, combined for 8.3 points a game. Overall, the team returns just 36 percent of its scoring from the previous year. Save Miller, no returning player averaged more than 12 minutes a game last year.
The Crimson won’t miss Chambers during its first two contests, early-season home games against McGill and MIT that appear to be wins on paper. However, the three-game stretch against local opponents Providence, UMass, and Boston College could be telling of the team’s prospects for the season.
With Chatfield, Okolie, Edosomwan, and sophomore forward Chris Egi, Amaker has a lot of length to play with defensively. The team’s struggle will be where it almost always has been: on the other end of the floor. Without Chambers pushing the ball in transition or spotting up around the arc, two images that have become synonymous with Harvard basketball over the past three years, figuring out the offense will be the key to the Crimson season.

Apparently the Registrar doesn’t know the order of the days of the week, because tomorrow will function as an academic Monday to open up shopping week. It is unclear to us why this was not communicated to the student body in a more effective manner. (They must have been busy working out the kinks in the new my.harvard). Not to worry, the Flyby investigation team is here to confirm that Wednesday is Monday, but Thursday is Thursday. We will repeat, expect Monday classes tomorrow, but do not go to your Tuesday classes on Thursday! Order will be restored by the time you wake up Thursday morning.
Going forward, for all Registrar investigative requests, please tweet us at @crimsonflyby and we will deliver.

You walk into your proctor’s room and she opens the door and gives you a high five. Did you actually get a cool proctor this year?
You are forced to sit on the flokati rug because you showed up a little late and all the chairs are taken. It’s soft, but you wonder what kind of crumbs and bugs lurk between the strands of shaggy wool and feel a little grossed out.
Your proctor asks everyone to give the usual “Harvard Introduction.”
The first girl speaks uncomfortably slowly and softly. You think she said her name was Maurice. Did she say folklore and mythology or friends and margaritas? Whatever, you already forgot.
Your proctor shushes some guys whispering to each other on the couch. Maybe she’s not cool.
You don’t remember anyone else’s name, let alone their year and concentration.
The proctor offers an icebreaker, which, predictably, asks everyone to share the highlight of their summer.
One guy will not stop talking about his summer trip to visit his grandma in Texas, when their Prius (Austin is pretty progressive) broke down on the way to the grocery store when they were getting cream cheese for granny’s famous fried cheesecake (it’s still Texas, okay) and a real-life cowboy (TEXAS!) rode over on his horse to help but the horse got spooked and kicked the car and put a huge dent in it and it kind of stunk but in hindsight it was HILARIOUS. Apparently, the cheesecake was delicious. One nice looking girl fake laughs.
You reach for the Trader Joe’s chips and/or cookies and eat one. It’s very average.
You don’t really pay attention to the rest of the people talking and instead watch your proctor to decide if she’s cool or not.
The last person (finally!) in the circle to answer the icebreaker suddenly becomes very frazzled because he somehow has not thought of an answer in the 10 minutes it has taken for everyone else to respond. A tedious minute of “um”s and “I can’t just pick one highlight, it was such a great summer lol!” follows. He ultimately says he had fun with his friends at the beach one day.
Your proctor goes over the rules. Blah blah blah no parties blah blah. You don’t really remember these either. At the end of the day, it’s better to ask forgiveness than to seek permission, right? You see she has a picture on the side table of her and friends at what appears to be a nightclub so you decided she’s cool.
Meeting’s over. You thank your proctor and make a beeline for the door.
Scoreboard:
Names remembered: 0
Chips consumed: 3
Minutes never to be gotten back: 27

Ah, shopping week. That magical time when classes are “happening,” but not happening. For all of us making that painful transition back into the school year, this week seems like a great time to goof around and enjoy a few more precious days of summer. This plan is fun in the moment, but you may end up in classes that you absolutely loathe by mid-semester. Follow these do’s and dont’s to make the most of shopping week:
DO: Shop more than 4 classes! You won’t enjoy everything that looked interesting from the course guide, and scrambling to decide on a class after the first few meetings won’t be a great start to the year.
DON’T: Pick classes based on what your roommates, significant others, or even exes are doing. This is your education, and you need to do what you want. It may seem like you won’t survive an hour without your S.O. or a section with someone you can’t even speak to anymore, but it will all be okay. Don’t let anyone else talk you into something you don't want or out of something you do.
DO: Remember that the professors are pulling out all the stops this week. It’s not going to get better than the stunts they pull on the first day, so if you’re not intrigued now, you probably won’t be.

Unfortunately (or fortunately! Harvard loves its storied elitism! There are a lot of “Harvard specific” words and phrases that are important for any well-informed freshman to know. You don’t want to be the kid who shows up to class seven minutes early (on time, according to the my.harvard schedules), or refers to your course of study as (gasp!) a major. For those looking to ease the terminology transition, here are a couple of words from the pros:
Concentration: This one is simple, and it is a trademark of the school. It is simply a major, and using “concentrate” as a substitute for “course of study” is an easy way to humblebrag about attending Harvard, and lets your high school friends know that you’ve already changed. It’s also the official term used on the REAL FACEBOOK (thanks Mark Zuckerberg)!
Harvard Time: Not to be confused with the comedy group “On Harvard Time,” this means that all of your classes (and by extension, most of your extracurricular activities) will start seven minutes after their scheduled time. Classes still end on the hour, so just think of it as a built-in passing period. Like high school, except not high school.
Comping: Instead of just letting you simply join a club as you would at any normal school, at Harvard we like to make you spend a semester learning the “ways” of the club before you are actually allowed to become a part of it. Normally this entails a variety of interesting and non-demeaning activities, ranging from doing logistical work the leaders of the club do not want to complete to doing other logistical work that the other leaders of the club do not want to complete. Unfortunately, that’s often how you are going to get involved on this campus.
Berg: Short for Annenberg. In a sentence, “Hey, just finished section. Wanna meet at Berg in five?” An easy way to show that you have acclimated to the school, and that you are comfortable navigating the intimidating fish tank that is the freshman dining hall.
TF: Speaking of section, these will be the actual teachers for many of your larger lecture classes (think Ec10, CS50, etc.) Most professors choose to grace you with their presence infrequently during the semester, and the TFs (short for teaching fellows, graduate or Phd students) are the ones who will work with you on a day-to-day basis to make sure you understand the material. Pray for a good one!
HUDS: The lovely people who make your meals everyday. Wait for faculty dinner’s apple crisp before you complain.
HFAC, HCCG, HCAP, HAUSCR, HSA, etc.: If you cannot decipher these type of club acronyms, used quickly and often without explanation in a sentence, you can normally at least tell what the “H” stands for. You will see the full range of these clubs at the overwhelming activities fair on Friday, but don’t worry too much if you don’t recognize the club from the acronym. No one does.
Punching: Something freshman guys often care about but shouldn’t. It means getting chosen to essentially “rush” a final club the way your friends at large state schools are doing at frats, and it’s not something to worry about until at least your sophomore year (and even then, not something that should occupy too much of your mind).
Quadded: In case you haven’t yet been to the faraway land known as the Quad, being “quadded” is what happens on housing day, where a third of our school is exiled to the former Radcliffe campus. Quadlings, as they are called, defend their Quad community fiercely and seem to have a pretty good time in their little corner of the Harvard universe. It is a longtime school tradition to make fun of those who are quadded, but the actual experience appears more mixed.
Formal: The name sort of speaks for itself, but these come later in the semester and are essentially less awkward, less formal dances than the ones you had in high school. They’re normally held at off-campus venues, and the main one for freshman is during second semester and is, shockingly, called the “Freshman formal.”
The Kong: Where hungry freshman (and sophomores, juniors, and seniors) go for late-night, questionable-quality Chinese food. After a long pset session at Lamont, nothing is quite as good as some salty scallion pancakes shared with equally hungry and weary friends.
Nochs: A pizza place a little off the grid from Harvard Square. A lot of people end up at Tasty Burger after late nights, but this place shows you really know the area. Try it at least once - people have mixed opinions about the quality of the food, but going with a group of friends one late Friday night is an unofficial Harvard tradition.
The Freshman Wander: Most closely identified with groups of freshman guys (identifiable from the Harvard keychain that hangs from many of their back pockets) who wander from final club to final club chasing down rumors that one club is letting in freshman guys. It is basically a long walk that begins at a freshman dorm room when one friend says he “knows a guy” at a party and ends at that same dorm room three hours later after a full walk around the river houses has proven that the friend did indeed not “know a guy.”
FOMO: Short for “fear of missing out.” Related to “the Freshman Wander.” Try to avoid it - the grass is NOT always greener on the other side, and CS50 psets cannot be completed on the last night without at least some loss of sanity and sleep.
Psets: Basically, homework. Not the most fun part of your experience here, but at least they are due less frequently than the homework you had in high school. That is, unless you are taking a math class. Anyways, unfortunately Camp Harvard cannot last forever, and psets will become a very regular (and somewhat painful at times) element of your life. Welcome home, freshman!

Saskia Maxwell Keller ’18 is a cellist dedicated to her craft. “I’ve always been playing, so when I don’t, it feels like something is wrong.” Unable to rent a cello in the small Tuscan town, Siena, where she was studying abroad, Keller travelled fifty miles to Florence by bus. But that was not the biggest challenge she faced – she had to find a quiet space where no one would hear her scales and concertos. After trying stairwells and gardens, Keller settled in an unusual room in the attic of her residence.
