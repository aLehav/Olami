A Lowell House committee will begin exploring a possible change to the House’s name, according to an email sent to Lowell affiliates by Faculty Deans Nina Zipser and David I. Laibson ’88.
The House is named for the Lowell family, including former University President Abbott Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877. Lowell’s tenure as University President, which stretched from 1909 to 1933, was defined by major changes he instituted at Harvard and by his racism, homophobia, anti-Semitism, and xenophobia.
Zipser and Laibson wrote Saturday that they will form a working group to deliberate on the House’s history and the repercussions of its ties to the Lowell family.
“This academic year, a working group will discuss the history of our own House and its relationship to the entire Lowell family, including Abbott Lawrence Lowell, who once led the University (1909-33) and is remembered for his racism, anti-semitism, purges of gay students, sexism, and xenophobia,” they wrote. “We will discuss the circumstances under which the House was originally named (for the Lowell family as a whole) and the arguments for and against changing the name.”
During his tenure, Lowell instituted the House system and worked to integrate students from different socioeconomic backgrounds into the College. He also, however, sought to limit the number of Jewish students at Harvard and excluded African American students from living in Harvard Yard. Alongside former Dean of the College Chester N. Greenough, Class of 1898, he led a purge of gay students known as the “Secret Court” of 1920.
Among the replacement names Zipser and Laibson floated were John Lowell, Class of 1760, an abolitionist Massachusetts judge; W. E. B. Du Bois, Class of 1890, cofounder of the NAACP who graduated from Harvard with three degrees; and Amy Lowell, a Pulitzer Prize winning poet who had a long-term, romantic relationship with actress Ada Dwyer Russell. Lowell, sister to Abbott Lawrence Lowell, lived with Russell for over a decade while the University President led the Secret Court.
The working group marks only the latest action Lowell House has taken to address its past and connection to the Lowell family. In March 2019, Zipser and Laibson announced that, when Lowell reopened following a multi-year renovation, portraits of Lowell and his wife Anna Parker Lowell — which previously hung in the House dining hall — would not return to the space.
Other Houses have been grappling with their own controversial namesakes.
Mather House residents have sought to change their House’s name from that of former Harvard president and slave owner Increase Mather, who was a member of the Class of 1656. A student-led petition has garnered more than 400 signatures since it began circulating in early June.
Still, Zipser and Laibson acknowledged in the email that they do not have the power alone to establish a new House name. That ability rests with the members of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest-governing body.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roughly 27 percent of the external asset management firms that oversee parts of Harvard’s $40.9 billion endowment are majority-owned by women and people of color, according to a letter from Harvard Management Company’s CEO N.P. “Narv” Narvekar and Chief Compliance Officer Kathryn I. Murtagh on Friday.
The specific firms oversee approximately 26 percent of HMC’s externally managed assets.
Narvekar and Murtagh's letter comes in response to a missive sent earlier this month from U.S. Representatives Emanuel Cleaver II (D-Mo.) and Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.) to University President Lawrence S. Bacow and the leaders of 24 other universities requesting information about the diversity of their external asset managers.
Bacow, Narvekar and Murtagh responded with their own letters July 31, the deadline set by the congressmen.
“Harvard improves with each action we take in support of a more diverse and inclusive environment,” Bacow wrote. “They not only help individual members of our community realize their full potential in teaching, learning, and research, but also remove systemic hurdles that too many have had to surmount for far too long.”
“Like you, I believe that affirmative steps toward expanding opportunity for women- and minority-owned firms upholds the ideal of equal opportunity and can play a significant role in closing persistent wealth gaps,” he added.
Narvekar and Murtagh's letter listed other efforts at HMC to find women- and minority-owned asset managers, including contracting a third-party service to set up monthly introductions with diverse managers and partnering with various initiatives like the Diverse Asset Managers’ Initiative.
The letter also went into detail on how HMC selects its external managers. Candidates are rated on three categories — organizational structure, track record, and investment edge. The process yields approximately one new manager relationship per 100 introductions, and is applied to all established managers, regardless of gender or race.
Narvekar and Murtagh also wrote that 50 percent of HMC's 20 internal managing directors self-identify as women or people of color.
“Recent activism has emphasized the necessity of rapid individual and collective action to achieve lasting social change,” Narvekar and Murtagh wrote. “While no one economic actor can repair centuries of systemic racial, ethnic, and gender discrimination, each of us must do our part to expand opportunities for women- and minority-owned firms and encourage our peer institutions to do the same.”
Robert Raben, the director of the Diverse Asset Managers’ Initiative, wrote in an emailed statement that he commends Harvard’s “thoughtful” response to the representatives.
“Clearly, they are taking a new approach to how they think about minority and female participation in the endowment, which is great,” Raben wrote.
Still, he encouraged Harvard to “put out the actual numbers in detail” to reveal if most of the firms are majority-owned by white women, or people of color.
“We have no way of knowing whether African Americans and Latinos are participating in the endowment in any meaningful way; our suspicion is they are not, or Harvard would say so,” Raben wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard began piloting Tracefi — a Wi-Fi-based contact tracing system — this past Friday in preparation for freshmen and a select group of upperclassmen students’ return to campus later this month.
Tracefi uses the signals phones, laptops, and tablets constantly emit to Harvard’s Wi-Fi infrastructures to gather three pieces of information: a datetime stamp, the signal strength received by Harvard’s Wi-Fi infrastructure, and the MAC address of the mobile device. The system then stores the data for up to 28 days.
Harvard will use the Tracefi data to aid contract tracing efforts run by Harvard University Health Services and Harvard University Information Technology by providing information to human contact tracers about the specific whereabouts of infected individuals.
“We all want Harvard to return to lab research and on-campus activities safely, and we want our undergraduates to return to campus too,” Tracefi’s website reads.
“One of the safety precautions Harvard wants in place to achieve this vision is the ability to notify a person who was in a building that she came into contact with someone who later tested positive for COVID-19. Timely notification can help her seek prompt testing for herself and protect her family and others from exposure.”
The website explains that the data collected from the Wi-Fi information does not contain personally identifiable information, and that HUHS will only access relevant data if a patient tests positive for COVID-19. People can choose to opt-out of Tracefi by turning off Wi-Fi service on their device, the info page for the program notes.
The Tracefi pilot program in the Houses consists of town halls — meetings to gauge House affiliates’ interest in the program — and “fingerprinting” spaces, which involves determining the signal strength in different areas of a room to determine the optimal position for Tracefi devices
Government professor Latanya A. Sweeney, the director of the Harvard Data Privacy Lab and the co-lead of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Testing and Tracing committee, said she believes Tracefi will fortify typical contact tracing methods. Sweeney also serves as a Currier House faculty dean, a role in which she oversees a residential community of hundreds of undergraduates.
“I started the Tracefi program with the same attitude I have today: can we make this work in a way that makes this community safe? That’s my only goal,” Sweeney explained. “Part of the reason Harvard brought some students back was the belief that we could do effective contact tracing, but contact tracing alone does not give us enough protection to stop outbreaks from happening that turn places like Currier into a cruise ship.”
Still, as the pilot program begins, some Harvard affiliates and privacy experts questioned whether Tracefi’s collection methods are too invasive, and whether the Wi-Fi data could be repurposed for other uses.
Tim Hwang, a research fellow at the Center for Security and Emerging Technology at Georgetown University, also found fault with the program. He said he views Wi-Fi-based contact tracing programs as imperfect due to issues with accuracy and security.
“Wi-Fi-tracing uses radio signals to determine whether or not two people are proximate to one another. This is actually a sort of very inexact science,” Hwang said. “Radio signals bounce off obstructions that can be easily distorted by buildings and other things.”
“The second issue is that it has been known in the computer security space for some time that Wi-Fi hotspots are notoriously vulnerable to cybersecurity problems,” he added.
Hwang also said he worries the mass collection of data can lead to “pressure to use that data for purposes other than what it was collected for.”
“There has to be very strong sort of rules and placing sort of bureaucratic incentives in place to make sure that it isn't sort of appropriated for some other purpose,” he said.
Despite security concerns, Asaf Lubin, a faculty associate at Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, said he believes Tracefi is “better compared to some other university contact tracing programs.”
“It’s not compelling you to download an app. It’s relying on information that the University already possesses,” Lubin said. “They’re not automating the decision making process, but relying on interviews to make decisions, thereby giving students the clear opportunity to challenge the findings. That’s important.”
Lubin also explained that while tracing a MAC address to its true owner is a “privacy intrusive element” of the program, the University could justify it due to the “legitimate public health reasons.”
In response to criticisms raised about the Tracefi system, Sweeney said she believes the program adequately protects the privacy of Harvard affiliates.
“The data gets locked down, and I don’t think it gets better than this with locking down the data while also having transparency and accountability,” Sweeney said. “The contact tracer is the only one seeing the data and the data relevant to that particular case. The goal is to empower the contact tracer and no one else.”
