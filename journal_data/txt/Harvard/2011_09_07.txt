After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Few events in recent memory seemed to sound the death knell of historical Harvard Square as much as the closing of longtime stationery store Bob Slate last March. After nearly eight decades of operation in Cambridge, the store shuttered its doors on Church St., Mass Ave, and Porter Square. Citing “advanced age” and “declining sales,” the storeowners opted to not renew their lease on their multiple properties in the local chain, erasing what had constituted a permanent fixture of Harvard Square for most of the last century. Undoubtedly, the market had shrunk for stationery during this time; with the emergence of global chains like the competitor Staples and the popularity of online vendors like Amazon, Bob Slate’s closure became a poignant reminder that many local businesses may be nearing the end of an era.
We opined that on some level the closing of Bob Slate was an unavoidable eventuality. With Harvard Square’s rapidly changing landscape, a business unable to adapt would inevitably sink. In its then-present form, we felt that Bob Slate could not survive in such an environment.
Now, mere months later, Bob Slate has signaled its intention to return, triumphantly announcing that the store will reopen within weeks with a new location, new management, and, perhaps most importantly, “a forward thinking vision.” We see the return of Bob Slate as a renaissance; its reopening will hopefully serve as an affirmation that Old Harvard Square can adapt and compete with New Harvard Square, preserving the historicity of the former while maintaining the practicality of the latter.
Businesses like Bob Slate are integral elements of Cambridge. For many, the presence of these buildings is the only reminder that Harvard Square did not come into its existence littered with Chipotles, RadioShacks, and Starbucks Coffeehouses. Their age alone is a cultural asset to our community, and regardless of their wares, these stores have intrinsic value. Unfortunately, age will not protect a store from declining profits, and a loyal patronage will inevitably diminish with the passage of time. The economy never stops moving, regardless of how worthy the businesses it tramples underfoot may have been. Consequently, we can only hope that the stores themselves will take the initiative to adapt—Bob Slate has done just that, and it inspires us that the store’s new owner will strive to make the business viable again.
At this point in time, it remains unseen whether or not the new Bob Slate will succeed in the medium or long term, but we certainly hope it does. Despite what some might think, Bob Slate’s closure was the product of neither a single issue nor the actions of a single actor. Globalization, digitization, and generational changes converged to form a perfect storm of inhospitable conditions for the stationery vendor. The new owner will need to address all of these issues if Bob Slate is to prosper beyond the near future. Although current signs by incoming management are encouraging, we do not doubt that there will need to be significant changes to how Bob Slate conducts its business if it intends to be competitive. An increased online presence and economical options for customers are just the tip of the iceberg; Bob Slate will need to make itself relevant in the minds of a generation largely unfamiliar with its products and services. Many of the store’s products may be old-fashioned, but its business model need not be.
The ideal Harvard Square should succeed in both form and function; it should cater to the needs of its surrounding students while paying homage to the culture of Cambridge as a whole. Bob Slate’s rebirth will, with luck, signal the convergence of these aspects, heralding a new generation of a hybrid Harvard Square.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Few universities give international students better treatment than Harvard does. On my first day here as a confused, jet-lagged, and rain-soaked freshman, the organizers of the Freshman International Program welcomed me with a vegan pizza because I had indicated that I could not eat cheese. Small things like this that have made Harvard feel just as much of a home to me as my native Costa Rica. But when it comes to getting a job, international students at Harvard have a rough time—one that could be alleviated by proper action on behalf of the university.
All students at Harvard on financial aid have a term-time job included as part of their aid package. This is a good idea; by working, students gain valuable experience and life skills. The University goes to great lengths to help students land an on-campus job. The Student Employment Office provides valuable resources for students to find work, such as the online jobs database and a jobs fair.
International students, however, are uniquely disadvantaged in this process. Most students from other countries at Harvard College have an F-1 student visa stamped in their passports. Along with the power to enter and leave the United States as a student, the visa brings a stringent set of rules with it. Break the rules, and the consequences could include deportation.
Among these regulations is one stating that international students can only work on-campus during the academic year. That means I, or any other international student, can’t work at, say, Felipe’s or any other outside company.  Other countries don’t do it this way—international students studying in the United Kingdom, for example, can work in places unaffiliated with their universities. But the US. does, and for that reason I had to turn down an opportunity at an outside tutoring firm offering $30 an hour.
The government makes the rules, not Harvard, and while I could think all day long about what I’d do with $30 an hour, there’s nothing much I can do about it. Fine. The real problem  is the difficulty—not by any means insurmountable, but present nonetheless—that international students can face in getting on-campus jobs.
This difficulty stems from the Federal Work Study Program, a government plan to bolster student employment by paying part of students’ wages at on-campus jobs. From an economic perspective, FWSP makes sense: if universities have to pay less to hire their own students, they will hire more, and students will have more money to pay tuition and save for the future.
Logically, though, the program doesn’t extend to international students. Why would the government spend money on us, non-citizens who are expected to return to our countries of origin as soon as we graduate? On-campus employers, for obvious reason, prefer to hire students under FWSP. Courtesy of their subsidized salaries, WS students cost only about a third of what non-WS students cost. This is why, of the on-campus jobs listed on the SEO database, 54—fully a third—require FWSP eligibility, and therefore automatically exclude international students with similar financial need. These jobs include such classic sources of student employment as the libraries. Even in cases when jobs are open to both FWSP and non-FWSP students, the former, being less expensive, are likely to be preferred for employment.
With all the money Harvard has, extending financial aid so that all on-campus jobs are open to international students (only around a tenth of the student body) could prove to be a beneficial, and cheap, idea. The financial aid office could subsidize the cost of paying our wages from on-campus employers, so that we could compete with FWSP students on an even playing field. The price tag could hardly exceed a thousand dollars per student per year.
Compared to the generosity of Harvard’s existing financial aid program, that’s not much. But to someone living on his or her own in a foreign country, that money could mean a lot.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The outlook for the American economy darkened considerably over the summer. Due to factors including Euro Zone instability, the debt ceiling fight, the end of QE2, a Federal Reserve action that increases the money supply, and the Japanese earthquake, the economy has slowed to a complete halt. Tepid job growth numbers have turned into August’s zero jobs created at all, while the annual rate of real GDP growth for the second quarter of 2011 has slowed to an abysmal rate of one percent . In light of these factors, the Federal Reserve must take bold action to revitalize the economy at its Sep. 20 meeting.
The Fed has numerous instruments to increase growth remaining in its policy arsenal. Traditionally during a recession, the Fed purchases short-term government bonds to keep interest rates low, but with short and long-term rates already at zero, this is no longer a fruitful avenue for additional policy interventions. Instead, as was seen in QE and QE2, the Federal Reserve can increase the monetary supply and keep long-term interest rates low through purchasing a variety of longer-term and unconventional assets.
Increasing the money supply and keeping long-term interest rates low increase growth through a few meaningful channels. Low long-term interest rates make borrowing less expensive and thus can increase individual financial flexibility and finance significant consumer spending. For example, low long-term mortgage rates have currently made this a great time to borrow to buy a house, or to refinance your mortgage and use the savings to spend elsewhere. Increasing the money supply increases nominal wages and thus lowers the burden of nominal debts; when your nominal wages increase from $50,000 to $60,000, it becomes much easier to pay off $30,000 in accumulated nominal loans. Finally, increasing the money supply weakens the dollar, strengthening American exports.
Right now, according to a recent Bloomberg article, “in per-capita terms, nominal GDP is actually below where it was at the start of the crisis.” This is a clear sign that the Federal Reserve must dramatically increase the money supply, and another, larger, set of asset purchases, QE3, could effectively achieve these ends. Economist Joseph Gagnon has estimated that $2 trillion in asset purchases would have a comparable effect to $500 to $800 billion in fiscal stimulus.
An effective policy to couple with asset purchases would be a commitment to take all policy actions necessary until inflation hit a certain target, such as four percent, or unemployment hit a certain target, such as five percent. Charles Evans, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee and president of the Chicago Fed, recently suggested a similar idea, arguing for a statement that the Fed would take aggressive action until unemployment reaches seven percent or inflation reaches 3.5 percent. By setting an aggressive target and clearly conveying it to the public, the Fed would send a message to the businesses and consumers that they should spend their record cash reserves and expect loose policy, because inflation will steadily increase until employment has reached acceptable levels.
Finally, the Federal Reserve must stop paying interest on bank reserves. This measure was taken during the financial crisis to encourage banks to build reserves, and the policy, which pays banks to keep cash in reserve, is surely a significant incentive for banks to hold onto cash instead of to lend it out to businesses and consumers. Critics argue that this could result in the same type of risky low reserves that existed before the financial crisis, but the combination of stricter financial regulation laws and strengthened capital requirements are sufficient and more effective tools to keep the financial system safe than paying interest on reserves, which is giving banks an incentive not to lend money.
There is a small but loud set of politicians, commentators, and economists that is exerting massive political pressure on the Federal Reserve not to take any further action. A few inflation hawks on the FOMC argue that additional policy measures pose an undue risk of inflation, but current inflationary pressures are mostly driven by Asian commodity demands, and realistically, the country can afford much more inflation. During the 1980’s, core long-term inflation hovered around four percent, and there’s no reason that the economy can’t thrive with modest inflation.
Many politicians also strike the populist argument that increasing the money supply is a debasement of the currency and a striking moral offense. Yet we are nowhere near dangerous hyper-inflation, and currency policy is a tool to keep the economy growing steadily. During recessions, a slight devaluation of the currency increases American exports and strengthens consumer spending; while during a boom, a slight strengthening of the currency will dampen economic growth and keep the economy from overheating. The only morality judgment that should be made of currency policy is whether policymakers are doing everything in their power to end the tragedy of mass unemployment and get Americans back to work.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What is America’s proper place in the world? For a nation whose decisions shape the world’s future, especially a nation that is also embroiled in several wars and faces severe economic, budgetary, and financial challenges, this question should be at the front of our collective mind. Yet it is not. Instead we see partisan bickering and a complete evasion of this critically important question. While leaders from both parties spew shallow talking points and engage in ad hominem attacks, the true hallmark of democracy is vibrant debate. As we continue to avoid constructive debate on critical issues—especially foreign, economic, and national security policy—the future of our country and our ideals will slip out of our hands.
Why are we worried about the slippage of our country? Because we believe in our ideals. This is neither blind patriotism nor arrogance. The principles our nation was founded upon, embodied in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, make the world a better, safer, and more prosperous place. Although we possess a measured pride in our country for making great leaps in fulfillment of these principles, we are more proud of the ideals themselves—individual liberty, limited government, economic freedom, the rule of law—and the positive impact that they have had in each of the corners of the world. Our country, by virtue of our economic engine, has a responsibility to safeguard these fundamentally sound principles both at home and abroad. Failure to exercise our power prudently in pursuit of our ideals will irreparably damage these fundamental principles. Thus, we hope that our nation will continue to act responsibly in defense of these principles.
Pride in ideals and in the country that strives to embody them is not a revolutionary concept. From Saratoga to Gettysburg to Normandy to Iwo Jima, the pages of our history are filled with the stories of people who died for a cause. After the Second World War, leadership of the free world was thrust onto a victorious America by virtue of our economic strength. Yet we believe that, since then, we have lost the trail. Many of our actions have failed to live up to our principles. Even more concerning however, is that the principles we pride ourselves on no longer shape our policy. We feel that we are doing the valiant men and women who fought for their values a disservice by leading the engine of freedom, America, without being rooted firmly in our ideals.
But simply honoring our principles and acknowledging broader policy aims are only the first steps in policymaking; questions remain. If we believe in our principles, do we believe in spreading them abroad by force? Should we seek to inculcate them into other countries by nonviolent means, or do we believe they will be adopted with increasing prosperity? Are we damaged by our associations with heinous countries and unfair commissions in the United Nations, or is our membership in the organization a mutually beneficial vehicle of leadership? Is it important to support countries with similar principles, or should we support countries that satisfy our interests, regardless of moral considerations?
These are questions that must be answered. Yet there is far too little debate. Problems are poorly defined and solutions are unclear or ill-formed. Politicians and the media tend to avoid asking these questions and instead revert to talking points and sentimentalist rhetoric when discussing our nation’s policies. They skip the tough question of “Why” and proceed to “How” while even ignoring the “What”. The result is a dangerously shallow foreign policy debate that forgets the critical connection between domestic and foreign affairs. What has caused this failure of leadership? Simple—the tough questions are not asked in the places that educate these leaders—the universities. We believe that our national discourse has greatly suffered because constructive debate on foreign, economic, and national security policy has been lost in universities across the country.
Here enters this chapter of the Alexander Hamilton Society. AHS is a national membership organization dedicated to promoting constructive debate on basic principles of American foreign policy and the effects on contemporary issues. Because we do not believe that the policy consequences of our ideals are always clear, we do not advocate specific answers to these contemporary questions.
Dynamic debate is essential, and college campuses must serve as the starting place to rebuild this discourse. This chapter hopes to do its part to build a network of committed, proud American policymakers, by sponsoring major on-campus debates featuring professors and other experts around the world and by providing opportunities like seminars and internships for our members. Through our efforts, we can improve the national dialogue—and therefore the quality of policy-making—on crucial issues in foreign, economic, and national security policy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A pair of studies from Harvard Medical School researchers published last week highlight the risks and costs of missing sleep. One of the two studies explores productivity losses due to insomnia, while the second analyzes the health effects of sleeping too little.
INSOMNIA COSTS $63 BILLION
An HMS study published last week in the journal Sleep, found that insomnia causes sizable productivity losses for the American economy. Researchers analyzed data from the 2008-2009 American Insomnia Survey, specifically focusing on 7,428 employed or self-employed respondents aged 18 or older.
The study found that on average, those who suffered from insomnia where no more likely to miss a day of work altogether, but that their overall losses in productivity amounted to 7.8 days worth of lost work per work year.
The researchers estimated that this productivity decline translated to an annual loss of $2,280 per worker suffering from insomnia, or $63 billion per year in the larger American economy.
Study author Ronald C. Kessler, a Health Care Policy professor at HMS, said that the study attempts to illustrate the costs to employers of not providing adequate health care coverage to workers.
He said that while employers often ask how they can afford to provide coverage, “Studies of this kind ask the question, ‘How can you afford not to?’”
He added that the study indicated that insomnia treatments could be a “low-hanging fruit” for employers who could stand to reap much larger gains in productivity than losses in additional health care costs.
Insomnia is one of the most commonly reported sleep disorders, affecting approximately 23 percent of the workforce, according to the survey.
SLEEP APNEA LINKED TO HYPERTENSION
A second study reveals that those struggling to get enough good quality sleep may now have another sleep-related malady to worry about: high blood pressure, or hypertension.
A team of researchers including Harvard Medical School faculty members recently published findings indicating that those who spent the least time each night in slow-wave sleep were the most likely to develop hypertension.
In a typical night’s rest, slow-wave sleep, also known as deep sleep, accounts for about a quarter of one’s overall sleep time, or about 90 minutes to two hours of an eight-hour sleep cycle.
The study, published last week in the journal Hypertension, was conducted by examining 784 participants of a separate sleep study. The participants were all ambulatory men aged 65 or above.
Study author Susan S. Redline, a professor at Harvard Medical School, said that both sleep duration and quality are essential for avoiding disease among people of all age groups.
She noted that in a previous study she authored, which focused on children aged 16-19, subjects who awoke the fewest times in the course of the night had significantly lower blood pressure.
Director of the Division of Sleep Medicine at HMS Charles A. Czeisler ’74 said that, even when controlling for other factors like obesity, sleep disorders are the largest known cause of high blood pressure. Blood pressure falls during sleep, he explained, and patterns of disrupted sleep can prevent that nightly decline.
Redline said that the best ways to ensure an adequate amount of deep sleep, other than sleeping the requisite eight hours, are to avoid caffeine, alcohol, and cigarettes before bed and to set regular bedtimes and wake times.
She also warned that lack of sleep, which has been tied to weight gain and obesity, may be part of the reason for the dreaded “Freshman 15” weight gain.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ten years ago today, brothers Hamza al-Ghamdi and Ahmed al-Ghamdi arrived in Boston, made their way to Cambridge, and checked into The Charles Hotel for the night.
A week before, Hamza al-Ghamdi purchased tickets for himself and his older brother for United Airlines Flight 175—a flight on which they would, on September 11, 2001, hijack and crash into the South Tower of the World Trade Center.
As the tenth anniversary of the September 11 attacks near, events around Harvard are commemorating the attacks and their transformative effect on the country. Last night, the Institute of Politics hosted a forum discussion about how America has been shaped by the attacks in the past decade.
The panel—”9/11: Ten Years On”—focused on what moderator Graham T. Allison Jr. called the most pressing questions about post-9/11 America: Are we safer? Are we more aware? What mistakes have we made in hindsight?
Former Director of the National Counterterrorism Center Michael E. Leiter said that he is confident that America is a safer place after 9/11 because of, among other reasons, drastic changes in the intelligence community and acute sense of awareness among the government and citizenry prompted by the attacks. Still, Leiter and other panelists acknowledged that an individual or small group will always have the potential to do a great deal of harm.
“One big issue that our generation and the people in this room are going to face, is that technology makes it easier to kill people,” Leiter said, adding that “dumber and dumber people with less and less training are going to be able to harness these technologies.”
Kennedy School Professor of International Relations R. Nicholas Burns, who was finishing his first month as the U.S. Ambassador to NATO on 9/11, said that the U.S. needs to return to outsmarting its enemies instead of blindly applying force.
“What was interesting about the last decade is that the military was on the front, and diplomacy was on reserve,” Burns said, adding that “the diplomats, economists, aid workers, and journalists need to be the front line” instead of the military. “We can’t fight everybody. You can only do that so much.”
But like so many conversations about 9/11, the conversation inevitably strayed to personal stories from the panelists, who recalled their personal interactions with the tragedy. Leiter had his high school prom and swearing-in ceremony for the Navy in the Twin Towers, and ate his high school graduation dinner in the Twin Towers’ top floor restaurant, Windows On The World. Allison’s wife had bought a ticket for American Airlines Flight 11, but cancelled the trip last minute. Allison still has the boarding pass.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After failing to agree to a new contract for dining hall workers, the University and UNITE HERE! Local 26—the union which represents the workers—have agreed to extend the current contract until September 12. The contract was originally slated to expire today.
UNITE HERE! members and University officials will be in meetings on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday this week as they attempt to iron out a contract agreeable to both sides.
Union President Brian Lang said that no agreement has been reached because the University has not dealt with Local 26’s top demand—full time jobs for dining hall workers—to the union’s satisfaction.
“Harvard still has not addressed sufficiently the main concerns: hours and incomes,” Lang said. “We want the basics: 40 hours a week, 12 months a year. We want sustainable jobs.”
Despite the stall in the negotiations, University spokesperson Kevin Galvin wrote in an emailed statement that the extension does not signify a lack of progress in the ongoing negotiations.
“To date, the discussions have been productive and we are confident that an agreement will be reached that benefits both the University and the men and women who work in HUHDS,” Galvin wrote.
Lang said that union members feel that it is unfair for the University to ask for more from workers while it pays them less.
“Dining hall workers have lost 50,000 hours this year,” Lang said. “But we still have to feed the same number of students.”
UNITE HERE’s campaign for “sustainable jobs” has been accompanied by a push for the use of more sustainable foods—more local, fresh, and organic produce and fewer pre-packaged items. The union has said that the reduction in workers’ hours has not only hurt employees financially, but it has also negatively impacted the quality of the food they produce.
“A lot in the kitchen comes from cans,” said one dining hall worker who wished to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic. “We want to make good food for students, but we don’t have enough hours.”
Another key negotiation point within the sustainable jobs campaign is the union’s push for summer employment for its members.
Lang said that most workers are not employed in the summer months, despite the fact that Harvard has a number of temporary positions that open up while class is not in session.
“There are 850 summer temp jobs,” Lang said. “Our workers received 46 of them.” He said the union wants the University to give first priority for those temporary jobs to Local 26 workers.
Looking forward, Lang said that the union will not agree to extend the contract much longer.
“If we cannot come to an agreement soon, UNITE HERE! is prepared to take more severe action, up to and including a strike,” Lang said.

Computer Science 50, Harvard’s popular introductory computer science course, is taking efficiency to a new level with a revised office hour format that is simultaneously tech-savvy and social.
For the first time, office hours for the class will be held in House dining halls instead of the Science Center basement. And in a format inspired by the Apple Store’s Genius Bar, arriving students log in to the course website, cs50.net, and access CS50 Queue—a new application crafted this summer by Teaching Fellow Thomas M. MacWilliam ’13.
The program has students “raise their hands virtually” by typing in a question and giving it a topic label, according to David J. Malan ’99, who teaches CS50. A designated CS50 “greeter” equipped with an iPad is immediately alerted, and when a staff member becomes free, the greeter pushes a button that causes the student’s laptop to start flashing—signaling that help is available.
“We hate seeing those FMLs: I didn’t get help one time in CS50 office hours!” MacWilliam said. “Our goal is that students don’t have to be waiting.”
Malan said he hopes that the new system—which replaces an antiquated office hour format in which students often waited 30 minutes or more to speak individually with a teaching fellow or course assistant—will facilitate a more social and collaborative atmosphere.
“[The old wait time] has proved unacceptable pedagogically,” Malan said, adding that a key motivation for the change was not only greater efficiency but also the opportunity to make House dining halls a center for academic study and conversation.
Since the CS50 greeter can see all of the questions posed by students, he or she can send multiple students with the same query to a single TF or CA. In addition, CS50 Queue allows students to see the questions their peers have asked so that they can collaborate on their own, and an optional Facebook chat mechanism embedded in the application makes it even easier for students to interact—even if they’re not sitting right next to each other.
Students also have the option to make themselves “invisible,” in which case their names and questions will not show up to their peers.
CS50 Queue will enable CS50’s teaching staff to track trends in the types of questions students are asking and adapt lectures accordingly. They hope to continue unrolling new features, such as pictures of TFs and estimated wait times.
With the first problem set due on Thursday, students are already flocking to office hours—such as the session held in Leverett dining hall Tuesday night—and many find the format very helpful.
“If all office hours are like this—that’s pretty cool,” said Trevor J. Brandt-Sarif ’14.
The new design was largely inspired by Apple’s Genius Bar and the Physics 16 “Physics Nights” organized by Professor Howard M. Georgi ’68 in Leverett dining hall. Georgi was instrumental in garnering support for the shift, Malan said.
Office hours will be held Monday through Thursday, from 9 p.m. to 12 a.m., in Pforzheimer, Leverett, or Lowell Houses. The College and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will supplement Brain Break food on these evenings in order to relieve the burden on Houses.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following controversy surrounding the decision to display students’ signatures on a new freshmen values pledge, the College will remove the signatures from the base of the documents before hanging them in freshman entryways, Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 announced Tuesday.
In an email sent to the Class of 2015, Dingman told students that although he and the Freshmen Dean’s Office stand behind the message of the pledge, concerns over its implementation caused administrators to reconsider including the signatures where they can be viewed publicly.
Freshmen were originally asked by their proctors to sign the pledge at the start of their convocation ceremony earlier this year.
The document asks freshmen to commit to making Harvard a place “where the exercise of kindness holds a place on par with intellectual attainment.”
Though students were told that signing the pledge was voluntary, critics said that freshmen were pressured into signing the document, both because it was presented to them by authority figures like proctors and because the signatures were to be displayed for peers to see. Some charged that readers would be able to figure out who had declined to sign the pledge based on whose names were absent from the signed papers.
Dingman said that it was “unfortunate” if individuals felt pressured to sign the document. “That’s not what we really intended at all,” Dingman said.
But he defended the choice to introduce the pledge in the first place.
“We all think it’s been a good thing and nobody is feeling apologetic for it,” Dingman said.
He added that although the College had not decided if it would issue an identical freshmen pledge to future classes, it would continue to push the messages detailed in its language.
“I don’t think it’s the signatures that matter at all, frankly,” Dingman said. “The really critical thing is to put out in very clear language that [freshmen] are joining a community that has expectations.”

Free People—a new women’s clothing boutique at 63 Church St.—provides  Square customers with another outlet for urban fashion, according to  Store Manager Rachael M. Quinton-Medeiros.
Though there is already a Free People store in the Boston Prudential  Center, the new branch hopes to target the region’s young “artist types”  and college students, Quinton-Medeiros said.
While the store has the  feel of a local business, Free People is part of a national brand that  was started in 1970 and later changed its name to Urban Outfitters. Free  People became a wholesale subsidiary of the company and sold apparel to  small boutiques until current CEO Meg Hayne opened the first retail  store in 2002.
Harvard Square is now home to three divisions of the company, including  Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, and now Free People, which opened on  Aug. 12.
Free People’s Harvard Square location is one of 54 stores throughout the country, while the other divisions have hundreds.
“[Free People] completes our family here,” said Kenneth M. Bowker, store  manager at Anthropologie in Harvard Square. “We cross over so much and  work to promote each other, but our styles are also different.”
Urban  Outfitters sells both men’s and women’s clothing, while Anthropologie  and Free People sell women’s apparel exclusively. Bowker described  Anthropologie’s style as sophisticated, while Free People is more  bohemian.
Free People’s clothing line features five different styles, including  Lou for the relaxed type, and Meadow, a bohemian look. Quinton-Medeiros  said the five different styles try to appeal to each girl’s personality.
“The  vision for the store is to try to stay a little bit ahead of fashion.  We offer really easy to wear, gorgeous but comfortable items,”  Quinton-Medeiros said.
The employees identify with the brand’s California vibe in style and  attitude, said Visual Manager Nicole M. Fletcher, who graduated from  MassArt’s fibers program and is responsible for the interior design of  the 1,200 square foot store.
“I do display and appreciate the creative freedom I have here,” she said.
As a tribute to the company’s history, the store front in Harvard Square was modeled after the first store in Philadelphia.
The  store plans to connect with the community through customer-exclusive  events held on its rooftop, including a fashion night out.  Quinton-Medeiros also hopes to work with the University for future  events.
“You guys are our demographic. We want to work with you and get to know you,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
School’s back in session, and so are a bunch of Ivy sports. Others–like football–will have to wait a little while before opening the book on the 2011 campaign. With no intra-league contests this week, some of the biggest Ivy news was made in a place where few Ancient Eight athletes venture: the sphere of professional sports. We’ll sort out what’s going on in another edition of Around the Water Cooler.
Ivy Leaguers have famously made a habit of dominating many fields. Sadly, professional sports just isn’t one of them.
The NFL is evidence of that: other than a few notable exceptions (See Matt Birk '98 and Ryan Fitzpatrick '05), the league has been harsh to Ancient Eight grads.
This weekend saw another round of Ivy casualties. The Cowboys cut former safety Collin Zych '11, who captained the Crimson last year and helped anchor its defense.
Former Yale fullback Shane Bannon followed suit. When the Chiefs selected him last year, Bannon hadn’t really distinguished himself much in competition, but impressed scouts with his build and speed. He was, at the time, the only Yalie in the NFL. But that gig didn’t last long, as he too was given the ax over the weekend.
Thankfully, not all is lost. Cornell’s Bryan Walters is still on the San Diego Chargers’ squad. And, as Sports Illustrated writer Peter King enlightened us, Bannon’s dismissal may actually be a blessing in disguise. Now, King wrote yesterday, “he can get back to the work of a politically conscious being at a time when there seem to be too few young people who care about the issues of the day.” Gotta love the boy-this-generation-is-oh-so-screwed-up mentality.
King pointed out a hefty list of credentials that distinguish Bannon in the political arena.  He went to Yale, likes CNN, and, more legitimately, wrote his thesis on social media and Presidential campaigns.
While the world of professional sports has been (relatively) ablaze with Ivy news, things are just heating up in Ancient Eight play. Football doesn’t start for another 10 days, but naturally, people are lining up with their predictions for the 2011 champ. The early favorite is Penn, the two-time defending champion, with Harvard a close second.  But perhaps an upset is brewing, as this year the Quakers will have to travel down to Harvard Stadium in what may end up being the effective Ivy championship.
Regardless, it should be an exciting year of Ivy League football, especially since each of the eight teams returns its quarterback. In fact, the New York Times has preemptively declared it, “The Year of the Quarterback in the Ivy League.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The people I know with the best cause to behave arrogantly are, almost invariably, the ones least likely to do so. The most accomplished athletes are also some of the kindest and humblest, which only makes me more excited to see them win.
Esther Lofgren ’07-’09, who just won her second straight rowing World Championship in the women’s eight, is the epitome of this. For as long as I’ve known her, she has always downplayed her own accomplishments and sought to help her teammates.
By the time I met Esther, she was already an extremely accomplished athlete, able to boast of college All-America honors and gold both at U23 Worlds and in the senior World Cup.
I, by contrast, was a spastic freshman with zero rowing experience. While I was proud of a couple of things I’d done in high school, my abilities weren’t really anything to write home about. Mostly, I was just a kid who hustled.
It would probably be easy for an athlete of Esther’s caliber not to notice me. Instead, the opposite happened. When my friend, a fellow walk on, and I were having dinner one night in Leverett House, Esther walked up to us and said, “Do you mind if I join you?” For the non-rowing fans, this would be the rough equivalent of Cam Newton walking up to the hopeful Auburn walk-ons and asking them if he could play Madden with them. Naturally, we said yes.
I can’t say I remember the conversation too clearly. I’m pretty sure Esther claimed to be bad at a couple of things, and I’m also pretty sure another girl told me the exact opposite the next day. But I do remember that after Esther cleared her tray, my friend and I remarked at how kind, how friendly, and how humble this blonde rowing machine was.
In the ensuing year, the team watched as Esther tore up workout after workout. The distance or medium didn’t seem to matter; Esther was going to win. People of her size—6’2” and 175 pounds—probably aren’t expected to be good at things like running, but Esther was. Fitness is fitness, I guess.
But somehow, Esther always managed to encourage me as I tried to make improvements, and that hasn’t changed since she’s graduated and started rowing full time with the U.S. National team.
After graduating from college, Esther has collected medals like candy, and her results this summer have been particularly impressive. She was the only person at Henley Royal Regatta to win two separate cups—the Remenham Challenge Cup and the Princess Grace Challenge Cup—a feat especially impressive given the technical differences between the sculling required for the Princess Grace—a battle between eights—and the sweep rowing required for the Remenham—a quads event. Esther later took fourth in the quad at the World Cup stop in Lucerne, Switzerland. And then came arguably the biggest victory of her career: a win at the World Rowing Championships this past weekend in Bled, Slovenia. The result ensured that the United States would have an eight entered next year in the London Olympics.
Somehow, in between winning World Championships and working in Media and Communications for USRowing, Esther always finds time to think of the little people (both literally and figuratively) like me. She’s always encouraged me, answered my rowing qualms with long and thoughtful responses, and given me honest opinions when I wanted them.
I think it’s her kindness that I’ll remember better than her World Championships and Henley victories. Every year brings a different set of winners, each with his or her own remarkable story. Many of them deserve to be remembered well, but most people’s memories have a limit to the number of sports figures they can hold. So we remember the ones we care about, the ones we knew or the ones who made us think. But we remember our friends best of all.
I don’t think that greatness in athletics makes one a great person. But I do believe that Esther has succeeded in rowing in part because she is a great person. More than that, I believe that becoming a hardworking, kind, loyal person is an end in itself, and it is to that end that Esther is an undisputed champion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During Saturday’s game against No. 17 Cal Baptist, Harvard men’s water polo senior goalie Alex Popp was pitted against a countering, undefended attacker sprinting directly toward him at the end of the first half.
“There were 15 seconds left in the half—I knew it was do or die,” Popp said.
After falling behind 4-1 in the quarter, the Crimson had caught up to Cal Baptist, knotting the score at five goals. Now, with one of the nation’s best players racing toward him, Popp recognized the importance his save would mean to the team morale going into halftime.
Knowing the Lancer only had time for a pump fake and a shot, Popp pumped his legs furiously from inside the goal.
Once the shot was fired, Popp flung out his arm and blocked the cross-cage shot, only to look up and see a mere three seconds left on the clock and a tied game still on the board.
“Those are the saves that, as a goalie, you live for,” Popp said. “Going into halftime if they had gotten another goal and I had let them get ahead of us, it would have been devastating. Instead, we went into halftime knowing we could stick with these guys.”
Harvard held onto that momentum in the third quarter, keeping pace with Cal Baptist right until the closing minutes of the game.
Although the Lancers pulled ahead in the end to defeat the Crimson 13-9, Popp’s performance was recognized as an essential factor in Harvard’s ability to challenge a top-ranked team.
“The Cal Baptist game was really just ‘The Alex Popp Show,’” said Popp’s roommate, senior attacker Evan Zepfel.
The game against the Lancers was the second for the Crimson at the MIT Invitational this past weekend, a matchup that came after Harvard trounced host MIT 13-5.
The Crimson’s offense was characterized by a solid team effort, with eight different players scoring over the two games.
However, on the defensive end, Popp proved himself to already be a rising star on the team at this early point in the season.
With 18 saves on the weekend—including three one-on-one saves like the first-half closer in the Cal Baptist game—Popp formed the backbone of the defense and earned the award for Collegiate Water Polo Association Defensive Player of the Week.
“He played consistently the whole time,” head coach Ted Minnis said. “He kept shutting down their counter…giving us the ability to take a little more chances.”
“He’s going to allow us to do so many things this year in our defense that we weren’t able to do last year,” Minnis added.
In addition to his defensive leadership, Popp also contributes a distinct enthusiasm to the team dynamic.
“He’ll make a big save or someone will get a good field block, and then he’ll yell, he’ll splash and he gets everyone pumped,” Zepfel said. “His screaming makes you more excited and swim down a lot faster.”
Popp, who stands at six feet tall, dedicated his summer to intense skills and agility training, working to ensure that in his senior season, big saves were not a rare commodity.
“I really worked this summer to move and cutoff angles and make it hard to find gaps in the cage,” Popp said. “I made sure to get to the ball quick and not give [my opponents] the chance to build up an offense.”
According to Zepfel, this extra and, more importantly, specialized training over the summer has allowed Popp to return to Cambridge with more confidence
“He’s grown in his confidence so much,” Zepfel said. “He used to get so rattled. He’s done an amazing job of calming himself down and [moving on after being scored on]. He’s made a lot of technical improvements, but that’s the biggest thing: how he approaches every play.”
However, Popp said he plans to top his 230-save 2010 season by building off of his revamped enthusiasm for the game.
As he begins his final season with the Crimson, Popp enters each game with an energized mentality, an acknowledgment of his Harvard career coming to a close.
“There are only 27 games left—that’s really all I have left,” said Popp, who likely will not pursue water polo after graduation. “This is my last go. I have to leave it all in the pool. I’m going to take the rest of the season just one game at a time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the rest of the Harvard student body spent late August migrating back to Cambridge and fighting off the floods and winds of Hurricane Irene, Crimson women’s hockey juniors Jillian Dempsey and Josephine Pucci were battling seven other countries as members of the United States Women’s National Hockey Team.
Joined by former Harvard skater Julie Chu ’06-’07 and current Crimson coach Katey Stone, Dempsey and Pucci traveled to Finland to compete in the 12 Nations Tournament, a new week-long international contest designed by the International Ice Hockey Federation to narrow the skill gap between countries.
And aided by the Crimson trio’s 19 points, the Red, White, and Blue crushed the competition, compiling a perfect 6-0 record while outscoring its opponents, 48-1.
Eight countries—the U.S., Canada, Finland, Japan, Russia, Slovakia, Sweden, and Switzerland—sent squads to Vierumaki, Finland for the tournament, held from August 24-31.
“The point of the tournament was to have good competition for all the programs [and] for the U.S. and Canada to help develop some of the other countries’ programs’ skills,” explained Dempsey, who notched three goals and an assist in five games. “We went to improve ourselves and become a better team.”
“Most of it is an effort to build the sport of women’s ice hockey throughout the world,” added Pucci, who recorded a team-high nine assists.
For the U.S., the journey to Finland began in Blaine, Minn., weeks before the competition with a tryout early in August.
While both Pucci and Chu had skated with the national team before, it was Dempsey’s first experience.
“I played on the U-18 team my senior year in high school, but this was a completely different level,” Dempsey remarked. “It was unbelievable—nothing else like it.”
After being selected for the final squad, Dempsey and Pucci enjoyed the benefits of wearing the red, white, and blue while skating with familiar teammates.
“Being able to experience such an honor with other Harvard hockey players makes the experience so much better,” Pucci said.
The duo looked to Chu—a former Crimson skater and three-time Olympian—for hockey advice and for stories of past international competitions.
“When I was younger, I would come to Harvard hockey games, and Julie was still in college,” Dempsey recalled. “I looked up to her as a role model, and playing on the same line as her for some of the games—it was nice to have that Harvard connection.”
But with Stone behind the bench, Chu wasn’t the only familiar face for Dempsey and Pucci to look to.
Entering her 18th season at Harvard, Stone was named head coach of the U.S. National Team in 2010, and soon led the squad to victory in the IIHF World Women’s Championship in 2011.
Under Stone’s direction, the United States proved to be the tournament’s dominant force from the very start, netting 12 goals against Russia and 13 against Japan to open the competition. Next was Switzerland—the only country to resist a shutout. The U.S. bounced back in following game, shutting out Canada, 4-0.
“We were all raring to go for the Canada game,” Dempsey said. “It was my first time playing the Canadian National Team, and it’s really exciting to be playing against their top players.”
Team USA and Canada coaches arranged another meeting between the two countries to provide more experience playing at the top level.
“The second game was a tough one because they were playing really physical—they came hard right back the next day,” said Pucci, whose squad fell in the exhibition.
Tired from the match with Canada, the U.S. edged out Sweden, 2-0, and rounded off the tournament with a 6-0 win over the host, Finland.
The Crimson players returned to Harvard a couple days late and jetlagged, but, according to Dempsey, it was well worth it.
“Every single game you had the honor of wearing the USA jersey,” Dempsey said. “You get to represent your team and country.”

The eye-catching new signs at the entrances to the Science  Center shouting in all-caps that tour groups are no longer allowed in the building are no joke—the management wants to keep the camera-happy throngs out.
The new policy is a response to complaints about tourists disrupting classes this summer, according John B. Mathers, senior facilities manager of the Science  Center.
At times, Mathers wrote in an email, tourists entered the back of an auditorium during a lecture, snapping photos and chatting.
"The addition of another 40 or so non-Harvard persons standing around taking pictures simply creates an impediment that is not needed," Mathers wrote.
The signs also state that individuals may not take photos or video inside the building, reminding visitors of a longtime University policy prohibiting unauthorized photos in classroom buildings.
That didn't stop us from taking a photo of the sign.

With shopping period ending today, it's time to get serious about classes. One of the best ways to do this is to buy books (and maybe even start reading them).  Between bookstores, fellow students, and the internet, there are almost as many ways to purchase books as there are to shop classes.  By the time you visit the Coop to check prices, search for all your books individually on half.com or Amazon.com, and meet up with a random guy in your House to purchase his outdated Ec 10 book, you probably could have done your reading for the whole week (if you only had the books).
 
Eric J. Slingerland '14 wants to help ease this painful process. Collaborating with a friend at Yale, Slingerland spent the summer creating a website called books@harvard.
 
On Slingerland's site, the first step is to create your course list.  From there, the website generates a list of all the books you need for the classes you've selected. It displays bar graphs comparing the price of each book new or used on Amazon and at the Coop. From there, you can export the list to your Amazon account and buy (and if you've signed up for Amazon Prime with your .edu address, shipping might be free). 
 
"I wanted to find a way to speed up the process and make it easy for people to buy from Amazon," said Slingerland.  "It's far more efficient than the Coop."
 
Books@harvard has already had over 200 visitors and has sold close to $6000 worth of books.  According to Slingerland, the website’s Yale counterpart has sold four times more books, a success that he attributes to greater publicity at Yale.  Slingerland and his friend have also expanded to 13 more schools beyond Harvard and Yale.
 
"I envision a huge portion of the student body using my website," said Slingerland. "I'm just so excited about the idea of this website and its potential."
