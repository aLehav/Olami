After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This summer, I left North America for one of the first times in my life. On an El-Al jet surrounded by dozens of other Jewish college-aged students, I flew across multiple continents before landing in the Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv to embark on my “birthright”: an all-expenses-paid ten-day trip across Israel.
Unlike Crimson editorial writer Samuel Doniger, my compunctions about travelling to Israel were not about the safety of public buses or the loneliness of Israel’s desert terrain. Rather, I feared what I would learn on the trip: Taglit-Birthright Israel, the organization that currently sends 40,000 students and young adults per year on ten-day tours of the Holy Land, is notorious for its role in influencing the political ideology of American Jews. (After all, Birthright gets much of its funding from the right-wing Israeli government and right-wing American Jews like casino magnate and Romney supporter Sheldon Adelson.)
At first, I was surprised to find that my Birthright trip was less explicitly political than I had feared. Our tour guide, a young Israeli who is also a reserve officer in the Israeli Defense Forces, gave us a thorough and objective history of the Israeli border and otherwise seemed to focus on describing Israel’s tourist attractions, ruggedly beautiful landscape, and Jewish culture.
However, I soon realized that a trip around Israel aimed at fostering Jewish identity cannot avoid politics. From its name—“Birthright” implies that all Jews have the right to the land of Israel, while ignoring the Palestinian refugees who have been prevented from returning home for decades—to its itinerary—which includes ventures into the disputed Golan Heights, where participants gleefully take pictures of the ruined shells of “abandoned” Syrian homes—Birthright advances the political agenda of the Israeli and American right. The fact that it does so in an insidious way makes its messaging all the more dangerous.
As all Birthright trips do, my group travelled to the Holocaust history museum, the Yad Vashem. Most of the museum is centered around a long, dark tunnel with exhibits on each side detailing the horrors inflicted on Jews in Europe. The “light at the end of the tunnel,” the symbolic conclusion of the Jewish saga, is a balcony overlooking Jerusalem. The tour guide at the museum asked us, “Why did God let the Holocaust happen?” One American on my trip dutifully responded, “If it weren’t for the Holocaust, there might never have been a state of Israel.” The existence of a political state hardly seems to justify the extermination of over 10 million innocent people, but this was the message conveyed by the architecture of the Yad Vashem and seemed to be the narrative our tour guides desired us to understand.
At the end of our trip, our tour guide brought us to Mount Herzl cemetery, Israel’s national cemetery. At the area of the cemetery reserved for civilian victims of acts of terror, our guide told us why it was important for us as Jews to support Israel: because “Arabs are different from us,” and teach their children to hate in school. As members of my group supplied other examples of “Arabs” killing innocents—“Syria.” “Iran.” “Al-Qaeda, 9/11.”—we reflected on the necessity of defending Israel from the Palestinians, who, after all, have plenty of Arab brothers and sisters to support them, right?
Throughout the rest of our tour, we spoke to young IDF soldiers who dismissed human rights abuses against Palestinians as a forgivable consequence of a Jewish state. We spoke to older Israelis who informed us that Israel was the only place in the world safe for Jews, invoking the racism that seems to run unquestioned through Jewish Israeli public discourse—one told us, “there could be another Holocaust in America any time. Jesse Jackson, or another one of those black people…” Our trip leader supplemented these interactions with a quip about Israel’s thriving biotechnology industry: “Israel doesn’t have many natural resources, but we do have the Jewish mind.” We posed for a picture atop an old tank, shouting, “Israeli power!” And meanwhile, throughout the entire tour, we were encouraged to return to Israel, to make aliyah.
Zionists look to Birthright Israel as a way to inspire Jewish pride among largely assimilated, ethnically Jewish college students. Even liberal Zionist Peter Beinart, when he came to speak at Harvard last semester, critiqued Birthright only for failing to expose participants to a Palestinian perspective (it’s true: we didn’t speak to a single non-Jew during a full ten days in the Middle East).
But Birthright’s idea of engaging with Israel means supporting an illegal and oppressive military occupation, claiming citizenship to a state that deports African immigrants, glorifying “the Jewish mind,” and decrying all Arabs collectively for their hateful terrorist tactics. Simply introducing a Palestinian voice could not begin to correct for the fact that Birthright is firmly entrenched in right-wing rhetoric, from racism to militarism. If liberal American supporters of Israel truly hope for their children to engage with global Jewish politics in a meaningful way, they should stop sending them on a trip to Israel called “Birthright” and start teaching critical thinking about the role of Jews in promoting justice around the world.

In the world of clean energy, solid oxide fuel cells are a key research area in developing ways to produce energy cheaply and efficiently. Recent research from a group of materials scientists at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences has gone one step further with the development of a cell that stores energy as it converts hydrogen into electricity.
The new cell, which continued to generate power for a short time even after researchers cut the fuel supply, could set a new path in the development of portable energy sources in environments where fuel access is limited, according to SEAS professor Shriram Ramanathan, the principal investigator for the project.
Ramanathan, lead researcher, SEAS post-doctoral fellow Quentin Van Overmeere, and SEAS graduate student Kian Kerman detailed the results in a paper published online in the journal Nano Letters in June.
The team had been working with the compound vanadium oxide for a number of years when they decided to use it in a solid oxide fuel cell.
Though the paper posited different theories as to the mechanism of this new cell’s energy storage, the team still lacks a definite answer.
“We think that the ability of vanadium oxide to change its valence state and possibly also store hydrogen locally can contribute to this effect,” Ramanathan said. “In the context of an energy application, this ability of vanadium to change its oxidation state is extremely valuable.”
According to Van Overmeere, further exploration of this phenomenon is the next logical step for their team.
“We definitely need to know more about the mechanism,” Van Overmeere said.
Ramanathan agreed, saying that further experimentation could yield better results.
“This could lead the way to designing improved materials that would lead to an even better performance,” Ramanathan said. “We could also explore integrating these type of layers into high performance devices and see if that gives you better results in terms of fuel utilization.”
Ramanathan said that at this stage, the results are only a “proof of concept.”
With further research, the potential technologies opened up by this development could  ultimately find a home in areas and applications where fuel access is constrained.
“In many robotics systems and so forth, there’s a great need for power sources in unconventional environments,” Ramanathan said. “The capability of storing fuel and being able to release it on demand for energy generation would be game changing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jeremy Lin ’10 is in the news again. After leaving the USA Select Team to focus on his restricted free agency, the former Crimson guard visited the Houston Rockets on Wednesday. Lin reportedly walked away from that meeting having signed an offer-sheet worth $30 million over the next four years. The deal would be worth a combined $10.2 million in the first two years and then $9.3 million each of the last two years.
This does not mean that Linsanity will be going to Houston though. Rather, it sets the table for the Knicks, who now have three days to match the Rockets’ offer, to keep Lin in New York.
Despite Lin’s potentially considerable contributions on the court, much of this bidding war is being driven by his appeal as an ambassador to the Asian-American community – a largely untapped NBA fan base that exploded during Lin’s extended run last season. The Rockets already have a connection to the Asian fan base, having been the home to Yao Ming for most of the last  decade, and may be pursuing Lin in order to extend that popularity. Regardless of the motivations, Lin’s appeal makes him more valuable to a franchise than a player of comparable playing ability.
This news of Lin signing the offer sheet comes a day after grizzled veteran Jason Kidd agreed to what appears to be a sign-and-trade deal that will move him from the Dallas Mavericks to the cavernous confines of Madison Square Garden. The decision does not appear to have any bearing on whether or not the Knicks sign Lin, and Kidd is expected to serve a role as a mentor to Lin as they share the backcourt.
The stars seem to be aligning in New York, but it is not without cost. Assuming both the Kidd and Lin deals go through on July 11 – the first day teams can actually sign players to new contracts – the Knicks will have $77 million locked up for just six players, three of whom will be 30 when the season starts up again in late October (Kidd 39, Tyson Chandler 30, and Amare Stoudemire 30). The league salary cap is roughly $58 million, meaning the Knicks will only be able to sign players to league-minimum salaries from here on out, in addition to paying the luxury tax.
The numbers will eventually sort themselves out, but for now we know that Lin will either be spending the next four years in Houston or New York.

It's 1:30 in the morning, and you're hungry. But where do you go? It is a divisive debate among the Harvard student body, and loyalties to the Square's late-night stops run deep. So far, The Crimson has debated 10 of 11 popular choices around campus. Last, but not least: Pinnochio's.
On a little corner not a far walk from the Square, you’ll see a white brick building—enter through a small red door, and you’ll find yourself in the cramped Pinocchio’s Pizza & Subs, searching everywhere for a seat (and usually not finding one). But no one goes to Noch’s to sit.
They go to eat.
In my first week on campus, I was instantly hooked. Not by the subs, although they’re also pretty awesome. But by the pizza. And not by any pizza, but by the thick slices of deep-dish decadence that Noch’s terms its Sicilian. I’ve never had anything better—pizza or otherwise.
Two flavors of the Sicilian pizza really got me from the start. First, there’s the “pizza rossa,” completely in contrast to the typical composition of a late-night pizza (i.e., covered in mountains of I Can’t Believe It’s Not Cheese). Instead of covering up cardboard crust and sauce from a jar, each slice of pizza rossa embraces its fundamentals—no ordinary cheese, but a small spread of mozzarella in its center, it’s all about the sauce and the bread. Which, both at perfect consistency and packed with flavor, are out of this world. That’s not to say Noch’s skimps on the cheese, though; plenty of its pizzas add a hefty layer into the mix, and most student organizations at Harvard will tell you that Noch’s plainest cheese pizza brings students flocking to the most boring of events.
My favorite slice of pizza, however, brings an unexpected ingredient to the table—spinach. Now don’t get me wrong: like most of America, I hate the wriggling green masses I was forced to eat as a child. But somehow, the chef’s at Noch’s get it right. All of their vegetables, rather than serving as the usual tasteless pretense that usually are, add richly to the flavor of their pizzas. My kids will undoubtedly be eating their veggies in pizza form, at the best pizzeria in the world.
More than anything else, however, Noch’s has a huge personality as a restaurant. While most pizza joints are stereotypical chain franchises (or worse, the sketchy back-alley ones I wouldn't be caught dead in), Noch’s has a rich history here at Harvard—frequented by notables like Mark Zuckerberg (and the restaurant now sponsors technology forums every Friday as a result), Ben Affleck, and Matt Damon, it’s a unique atmosphere for a pizza place. And with a dash of Italian sass interspersed with the friendly staff, the great service becomes part of the experience, too.
At $4.90 for two slices of the Sicilian (which can easily fill you up, especially as a late-night snack), Noch’s is a great deal for any meal. It’s a one-of-a-kind pizza, served from a one-of-a-kind place. And, as the whale and the mermaid on the wall well know, it’s worth the chase.

Every week, The Crimson publishes a selection of articles that were printed in our pages in years past.
July 6, 1943: Traditions Give Way in Modified House System
Although they will be operating under entirely different circumstances and conditions, Adams, Dunster, and Lowell, the three civilian Houses, will still carry on in an abbreviated and modified form the traditions and customers of the old House system, David M. Little '18, secretary to the University and master of Adams House, said last night.

July 1, 1957: Student Employment Office Predicts Many Jobs for Men, Few for Women
The part-time employment forecast for summer school students was read yesterday as "bright for men; cloudy for women."
July 6, 1976: City Council To Decide DNA Question Soon
The Cambridge City Council will hold its final debate tomorrow night to decide whether it should ban Harvard from conducting recombinant DNA research in its Biological Laboratories.
The experiments, which involve transferring DNA into specimens of E coli, a commonly used bacterium, are designed to produce a new species, whose characteristics will be unknown and possibly dangerous.
July 6, 1977: Court May Not Try Pavlovich on Forgery, Fraud Charges
Spiro Pavlovich is alive and in bed in New Orleans.
The man who managed to boondoggle Harvard Law School into accepting him twice with false credentials and who allegedly falsified a federally-guaranteed loan application will probably never stand trial, his attorney said yesterday.
William P. Homans Jr. '41 said a doctor appointed by the New Orleans court handling the Pavlovich case reported the defendant to be mentally incompetent to stand trial.
July 6, 1979: Custodian Charged with Weld Thefts
Mark S. Giangregario, a University custodial worker, was arraigned yesterday at 3rd District Court on charges of attempted larceny, larceny under $100, and breaking and entering. After his arraignment, Giangregario was released on bail.
Scott Novins, a Summer School student living in Weld 30, said yesterday he noticed on Tuesday that his stereo had been placed in a brown paper bag next to Giangregario's plastic cleaning bag. He added he saw Giangregario sweeping up in the room and went to Wayne Ishikawa, dean of students, who brought the stereo to the Harvard Police. The police arrested Giangregario at 2 p.m. Tuesday. They are now testing the stereo for finger prints.

I’ve been accused of being many things in my day: a fool, a bro, a ‘God-damn liberal.’ But never a hipster; which is why my endorsement of Clover as the ultimate hipster-hangout in Harvard square should carry all the more weight.
You see, my support of Clover bears no pretense. I know I wasn’t the first one to hear about it, and the fact that I’ve been there a number of times probably makes it less cool than it was before. On the few occasions when I have graced Clover with my presence, I have worn shorts and a t-shirt, had a distinct lack of reading material, and conversed with others—sometimes about sports. I do not own a cardigan, my musical taste is eclectic and rather mainstream, and I’ve never tried their ‘Jaggery Lemonade’ straight from the markets of Mumbai—but I am sure that my non-refined pallet would not be able to appreciate the variety of flavors.
What I have tried at Clover are the French Fries with rosemary, and boy are they good. For just $3, you can get a plate of the best fries in town without having to worry about them being deep fried or processed—because, like, they’re organic and stuff. Sprinkled with just the right amount of seasoning and promised to be ready in 6.7 minutes, Clover’s fries alone propel it to victory for Hipsters and non-Hipsters alike.
Situated in a prime location on Holyoke Street and adorned with pseudo-industrial interior design, it has everything the Harvard hipster could ask for: convenience, quality, and the illusion of being ‘of the people.’ Clover was founded by an MIT-grad to serve Harvard-undergrads, not exactly a typical story for a local entrepreneur. But as long as their food stays tasty, people will keep on coming back. I hear the chickpea fritter with a side of rhubarb soda is to die for. Maybe the good folks at Clover Food Lab will make a hipster out of me yet.
