After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the Harvard men’s basketball team may not be happy with the final result of this afternoon’s 65-62 loss to Michigan, the squad must certainly be pleased with the progress made by freshman Laurent Rivard.
After a 0-for-11 shooting performance in his collegiate debut, Rivard has found his stroke this past week, netting a combined 36 points in the Crimson’s past two contests.
The 6’5” guard followed up on last Wednesday’s career-high 21-point performance by pacing Harvard with 15 points yesterday.
In 33 minutes of action, Rivard shot 5-of-9 from deep, keeping the Crimson within striking distance after it lost its lead midway through the second period.
In Harvard’s 80-57 win over Fordham last Wednesday, Rivard hit a number of key three-pointers down the stretch to keep the Crimson’s lead in double figures.
By the time the night ended, Rivard sank five treys after making just eight in Harvard’s first five contests combined.
“He works so hard, and he’s such a great shooter,” junior co-captain Oliver McNally said after the contest. “It’s about time something started falling for him.”
According to Rivard, the career night helped build his confidence heading into yesterday’s road contest at Michigan.
“He’s supposed to make open shots,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said Wednesday. “He’s a good shooter.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: 12/5/10 9:05 P.M. Tommy Amaker’s team did everything it could to earn its coach a victory in his return to Ann Arbor. But in the second half of Saturday’s contest, Harvard (5-2) got cold right as Michigan (5-2) got hot, and the Crimson was narrowly defeated in its attempt to win the school’s first road game against a Big Ten opponent since 1949.
The contest turned on a 19-1 second-half run by the Wolverines–who Amaker coached for six years before arriving in Cambridge–that quickly erased a 12-point Harvard advantage. The Crimson was unable to make up the deficit late, falling, 65-62, in front of nearly 10,000 fans at Crisler Arena.
“I thought it was a game we let slip away from us,” sophomore wing Christian Webster said. “We had the game in our grasp the whole first half.”
After entering the second up seven at 32-25, Harvard got a three-point play from junior co-captain Keith Wright and a floater from sophomore Brandyn Curry to open up its biggest lead of the game at 12.
But the momentum quickly swung in Michigan’s favor. Junior guard Stu Douglass drilled a long three, and on the next Crimson possession, Webster got caught in mid-air and threw the ball away, leading to an easy fast break dunk by Wolverine Darius Morris.
A clearly flustered Harvard squad then began to run its offense through Wright, consistently feeding the center inside, but Wright began to try to force shots, to no avail.
The junior’s turnover on Harvard’s next possession led to a Douglass layup at the other end, and after Wright hit one of two free throws the next time down, Douglass hit a fade-away jumper over Crimson junior co-captain Oliver McNally’s outstretched arm to cut it to 38-34.
Harvard then went right back inside to Wright, who missed a close-range shot, and four straight points by Wolverine Blake McLimans tied the game.
“We let them get going from the three-point line,” McNally said. “They started hitting some shots, and we started getting stagnant on offense, just waiting for Keith to do things.”
Douglass subsequently drilled back-to-back long threes on Michigan’s next two possessions, and the Wolverines were up six with 12:53 remaining.
“I think that’s kind of where the game got out of hand,” Webster said. “[Douglass] started making shots. I think we lost him a couple times on defense, and once you let a shooter get going like that it’s hard to stop him.”
But freshman guard Laurent Rivard matched Douglass with a long three of his own—as he would multiple times on the afternoon—to slow Michigan’s momentum. A Wright jumper and Webster three put the Crimson back ahead by two with 9:55 left, but that would be Harvard’s last lead of the contest.
The teams went back and forth for the next few minutes, but after two Webster free throws cut Michigan’s advantage to one, the Crimson left Matt Vogrich wide open for a triple to put the Wolverines up, 54-50.
Curry then picked up his fourth foul, forcing Amaker to replace him with freshman Ernest Rouse, who had not appeared in the game up to that point and air-balled a corner three with 3:38 remaining. Amaker quickly went back to Curry, but Novak beat Rivard backdoor for a reverse layup on the next Wolverine possession to give Michigan a six-point advantage.
After a Wright hook-layup, Douglass got open after some Crimson defensive miscommunication and drilled another long three to put the Wolverines up seven.
Rivard matched with a deep trey of his own, and Michigan missed some free throws down the stretch to give the Crimson a chance. But with eight seconds to go, Webster hit the back rim on a three that would have cut the lead to one, and Michigan was able to hold on for the victory.
“I thought we played pretty well,” McNally said. “But when you’re playing on the road, especially against a good team, you’ve got to be really sharp and not have any let downs, and I don’t think we did that well enough.”
The game was a back-and-forth affair early on as well. A 7-0 Michigan run capped by a Morgan jumper put the home team up right away, but Harvard–led by Wright’s three baskets off some nifty footwork–fought right back with a 12-0 run of its own to go up 22-17 four minutes later.
Douglass and Rivard then matched threes and a Wright layup off an acrobatic spin move would put the Crimson up seven with two minutes remaining in the half.
After Michigan shrunk the advantage, another Rivard long ball put the Crimson ahead by nine, but Morris hit a running jumper with a second remaining to send his team into the locker room down seven.
Rivard–who struggled massively in his first game in front of a similarly large crowd at George Mason–drilled five threes for the second straight contest, finishing with 15 points and preventing the Wolverines from breaking the game open on multiple occasions.
“I know last year in the first game for me, it was hard,” Webster said. “But I think he’s gotten used to it, and he’s found his rhythm.”
Wright added 18 points and 12 rebounds for his third double-double on the season. Webster scored 15 but struggled from beyond the arc, going 3-for-9. The team was hurt by the illness of sophomore Kyle Casey, who played only seven minutes.
Douglass proved to be the difference-maker against Harvard by going 5-of-7 from long distance and finishing with 19 points. Morris added 13 and Novak 12 for the Wolverines, who outshot the Crimson 58 percent to 38 percent from the field in the second half.
“Coach has done a lot for us, so it definitely would’ve been a good feeling to get him a win [in his return],” McNally said. “But it didn’t work out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The winning streak continues.
The Harvard women's squash team played its last game of the calendar year against Cornell yesterday, and the squad proved invincible once again. The Crimson swept the Big Red, 9-0, with only one player pushed to five sets—the first time this has happened this year. This is the fifth straight 9-0 win for Harvard in what has been so far a dominant defense of its national title from last season. If you include last year's undefeated season in the wins total, the Crimson has won 17 matchups in a row. Seventeen? That's like an entire football season plus one.
The last loss came at the hands of Ivy rival Princeton on Feb. 15, 2009 in that season's CSA championship game. Will the Crimson still be undefeated when the two-year anniversary of that defeat comes around? Harvard's schedule will significantly toughen up after the holiday break, with the Crimson facing Penn, last season's national semifinalist, and the Tigers back-to-back the weekend of Feb. 5-6. But with the way things are going now, it seems like no team will stop Harvard from steamrolling its way back to the CSA national championship game.

Do you want Harvard gear, but sick of the usual mark-ups on Harvard apparel? Urban Outfitters, the choice de rigeur for many collegiate hipsters and pseudo-hipsters alike (though some would hesitate to admit it), turns out to be an under-explored treasure trove of potentially Harvard-related apparel. Already attracting some attention with its Harvard-Yale shirt, the rest of the brand seems to be following an Ivy trail. We hereby present a slew of seemingly Harvard related apparel for your amusement and benefit. Many items, especially t-shirts, are on discount; good news for those budget-minded!
Fortune smiles upon proud Pfoho residents, who may don the latest polar bear sweater currently featured in the Cambridge store’s window display. And, even if you don’t make it to the party, you can still show your pride with a Make it Rain t-shirt. Similarly, tree-related items for nature-loving Currierites is in abundance, with choices varying from a tree shower curtain, an upside-down tree, and a very popular tree tapestry that can also be used as a bedspread or futon cover.
Next, Quincy residents can choose from a small, yet adorable range of penguin-themed items, including a booty buddy and a t-shirt featuring penguins who are too cool for school.
Other Houses can also choose from a range of mascot-related items: Leverites can happily indulge this winter in this cozy bunny sweater and these Monty Python slippers. A crimson-colored lion dominates this tee that those in Winthrop can purchase for the measly price of $24, while friends in Eliot can now proudly display their geeky side with this elephant tee at the same price. And, to show off their love of the moose, Dunsterites can accessorize with this hat and matching mittens.
Fish-related items for Cabot are unfortunately lacking. For consolation prize, here is a pair of creative fish socks...totally adorable, but who will get to see it apart from the washing machine?

CORRECTION: December 6, 2010
An earlier version of the Dec. 5 FlyBy post "Urban Outfitters Has  Harvard Apparel " incorrectly suggested that Mather House's mascot is  the tiger. In fact, its mascot is the lion.

It’s that time of year again. No, December doesn't just mean the beginning of the holiday season—but also the end of No Shave November. To better understand this annual tradition, we talked with Conor B. O’Herin '13 and John "Jack" E. Davison '14, members of the Harvard University Band who participated in a band-wide No Shave November competition, about how they braved last month in scruff.

Approximately 200 students spent last Thursday night at the Microsoft New England Research & Development Center (NERD!) for the CS50 Hackathon. The legendary "optional all-nighter" took place from 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. Here’s this Flyby correspondent’s log of the evening:
7:40 p.m.: CS50 sets out from campus. "I’ve never seen so many nerds on one bus," says one student as the shuttles leave Lamont Library.
7:56 p.m.: The shuttles arrive at the NERD. Students crowd into the elevators. They enter a wide-open room, and check in with staffers wearing "Property of CS50" sweatshirts. They crowd around a table stacked with Red Bulls and other caffeinated drinks: fuel for the all-nighter.
8:14 p.m.: "Let’s get some chairs over here," says course instructor David J. Malan '99 over the sounds of chaos, people running all around, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers in the background. Malan dashes from place to place, faintly perspiring. Many have already gotten to work. As they check in, they are asked to identify some milestones they hope to achieve. "I’m hoping to get the entire back end of our site up tonight," says Alice Xiang '13. She is designing a version of "Chat Roulette" for Harvard students. She hopes that it will be "less sketchy" than the original.
8:58 p.m.: Malan formally welcomes everyone to the event. "Coming up at 2 a.m. will be Chinese food. At 5 a.m., we will depart for IHOP if you are still vaguely awake."
9:17 p.m.: The work has begun in earnest. "I’m just trying to figure out how it all works," says Kyle S. Solan '14. He’s enjoying some free food and working on a phone application to provide information about dining hall menus, events, and campus news. The mood is becoming increasingly serious in the main hall. It’s starting to seem more and more like "The Social Network."
10:13 p.m.: People are beginning to feel right at home. One student lounges with a pizza slice in hand and nine Butterfinger wrappers scattered around him on the floor.
11:04 p.m.: Most are still hard at work, headphones in, but some have succumbed to temptation. Tony Ho '14 is taking a break from his work to play some StarCraft II. Others are playing Rock Band in the lounge. The night is young.
 
Sadly, this Flyby correspondent had to be back on campus before midnight, but the students of CS50 got a lot of work done on their projects before my midnight departure. Stay tuned for their final results and our video coverage of the CS50 Project Fair on Dec. 10.
