After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like many of Harvard’s homeward-bound students, the men’s basketball team has hopped on a jet this week destined for a far-off place.
But it won’t be enjoying a week of relaxation on the couch back at home; instead, the Crimson will compete in the inaugural Battle 4 Atlantis Tournament at Paradise Island in the Bahamas.
Early season tournaments have become a fixture in the schedules of many of the nation’s top basketball programs. Events like the Maui Invitational and the 76 Classic annually attract some of the best talent in the country.
The Battle 4 Atlantis will mark the Crimson’s first participation in such a tournament under the reign of head coach Tommy Amaker. It’s just one more stepping stone in the ascendency of a team that has begun receiving AP top-25 votes after struggling to a .500 finish just three seasons ago.
The tournament features an abundance of talent including No. 22 Florida State (4-0), College of Charleston (3-0), and No. 4 UConn (4-0), a club picked to win the Big East in preseason polls.
“It’s a terrific field of teams,” Amaker said, “and we’re honored to be included in it.”
The Crimson begins the tournament with a first-round matchup against Utah (1-2) on Thanksgiving night at 9:30pm (the game will be televised on HDNet).
The Runnin’ Utes, now a member of the Pac-12, have undergone plenty of change since finishing 13-18 last year. Larry Krystkowiak left the New Jersey Nets to take over as head coach for a team that boasts 11 newcomers and just four returning players.
One of those returning players, and Utah’s most dangerous offensive weapon, is senior guard Josh Watkins, who is posting just over 21 points per game early in the season.
“We think he’s the key to their ball club,” Amaker said.  “Different guys will be on him, and I’m hopeful we can defend him well to give us a chance.”
The Runnin’ Utes frontcourt is led by junior center Jason Washburn, averaging a near double-double through three games. Harvard will look to its own talented frontcourt duo of co-captain center Keith Wright and junior forward Kyle Casey to control the boards.
Utah stands at 1-2 after falling to Boise State and Montana State in its most recent outings. Amaker believes that the Runnin’ Utes will likely view their matchup with the Crimson as a prime opportunity to right the ship.
Should Harvard defeat Utah, it will play the winner of the University of Massachusetts and Florida State matchup. A loss against Utah sends the Crimson to the losers’ bracket, where it will play the loser of the same game.
Picked to finish near the bottom of the Atlantic-10 Conference, UMass (4-0) is off to a quick start thanks in part to a diverse offensive attack. Four players average double figures, with sophomore guard Chaz Williams leading the way at 17 points per game.
After a trip to the Sweet Sixteen last spring, Florida State has also started 4-0 and stands poised to compete with the likes of Duke and the University of North Carolina for the ACC crown. After the loss of star guard Chris Singleton to the NBA’s Washington Wizards, the Seminoles have been buoyed by a balanced offense led by junior guard Michael Snaer and a defense anchored by senior big man Bernard James.
Lurking on the other side of the bracket is UConn, the reigning national champion, which Harvard is already scheduled to face in non-conference play on Dec. 8. Boasting two of the nation’s best guards in Shabazz Napier and Jeremy Lamb, the Huskies present significant matchup problems for any team, especially one unaccustomed to the raw athleticism not often seen in Ivy League play.
Rounding out the tournament field are the College of Charleston, University of Central Florida (2-1), and the University of North Carolina-Asheville (2-2).
The tournament will force Harvard to deal with the athleticism of power conference teams even if it doesn’t find itself matched up against the Huskies.
“You’ve just got to go at them,” co-captain Oliver McNally said of the team’s strategy against athletic opponents. “If you play soft … they’re going to eat you up.”
According to Amaker, the Crimson feel prepared going into their three consecutive tournament games.
“We have things in our arsenal that should allow us to compete against those teams,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After Jillian Dempsey scored Harvard’s second goal of Wednesday night’s contest with 44.5 seconds left to play, the No. 9 Crimson (5-2, 5-2 ECAC) could not find the equalizer against a resilient Dartmouth (4-4-1, 4-2-1) squad, who won, 3-2.
The outcome was contradictory to how the game had begun. It took Harvard just 39 seconds to go up, 1-0, thanks to a Lindsey Fry goal in front of the net. Junior Josephine Pucci took a hard shot on goal from the blue line, and Fry was there to direct the deflection right past the goalkeeper and poach the score.
The Crimson did not let up in the first period, coming up with the better looks on goal. But the second and third periods went to the Big Green, who became aggressive on offense and scored three unanswered tallies.
Kelly Foley took advantage of a similar situation to Harvard’s first goal after her teammate’s hard shot bounced off junior goaltender Laura Bellamy. Bellamy was caught out of position, and Foley put the puck away into the open net with 9:01 left to play in the frame.
Three minutes later, Camille Dumais received a pass from behind the net and shot it past Bellamy’s left to set the score at 2-1 Dartmouth.
The third period saw Harvard seeking the equalizer to no avail. The Big Green was solid all night in its penalty kills, even shutting down a 5-on-3 Crimson opportunity that lasted 1:10.  Dartmouth put the game away with 2:50 left to play when Sasha Nanji took an accurate shot from the right and put it past Bellamy’s left shoulder.
The Crimson outshot the visitors, 29-19, but it could not convert its chances into goals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For most, the Ivy season is over. Harvard emphatically took the title, high-stepping into history by somehow finishing three games ahead of the rest of the league with only seven conference games on the slate.
And most of the accolades have been given, too. The first team, second team, and rookie of the year awards were announced earlier this week.
But two big prizes—the largest of them all—remain: the offensive and defensive player of the year.
In all liklihood, one of two Harvard seniors—defensive tackle Josue Ortiz or cornerback Matt Hanson—will take home the defensive honor, while Dartmouth running back Nick Schwieger and Cornell quarterback Jeff Mathews are the favorites to nab the offensive accolade.
Each has an impressive resume, and all are first team All-Ivy selections for 2011, with Ortiz, Hanson, and Schwieger all earning unanimous nods.
Ortiz followed up an All-American 2010 campaign with an eye-popping and  Ivy-leading 10 sacks this year despite being double-teamed on most  plays. Hanson, the 2008 Ivy League Rookie of the Year, took his game to a whole new level in 2011, becoming the dominant player at his position in the league and shutting down the league's top wideouts almost every week.
On the offensive end, Schwieger returned to the gridiron in 2011 after sharing the Cup last year with Harvard running back Gino Gordon ’11 and had another huge year, leading the Ancient Eight with 1310 rushing yards. Ortiz followed up an All-American 2010 campaign with an eye-popping and Ivy-leading 10 sacks this year despite being double-teamed on most plays.
But the clear favorite this year has to be Mathews, the Big Red passer. With over 1000 more passing yards than any other Ivy QB, Mathews led a resurgent Big Red team to a 3-4 record in a stacked Ancient Eight.
The sophomore may have sealed the victory with his performance in the year’s final two contests. Combining for 1069 passing yards in the pair of games, Mathews led the Big Red offense to a whopping 110 points and two victories, including a shocker over preseason favorite and two-time defending Ivy champion Penn.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a memorable, record-book-rewriting year for Harvard football, singling out one player for MVP recognition must’ve been a tall task.
But the Crimson figured it out, naming senior defensive tackle Josue Ortiz the winner of the Frederick Greely Crocker Award, annually given to the top player on the team.
A host of other seniors, including defensive tackle Ben Graeff, quarterback Collier Winters, offensive tackle Kevin Murphy, and captain middle linebacker Alex Gedeon, received accolades at the football awards banquet.
But perhaps the evening’s greatest honor went to junior linebacker Bobby Schneider, who will succeed Gedeon as the captain of Harvard football as the program enters its 139th season.
Schneider, a native of Grapevine, Texas, tallied 40 tackles in 2011, fourth-best on the team. A presence on the defense since his sophomore year, Schneider had 40 tackles in 2010 as well.
The junior’s best game of this season came early in the year. Against Brown in the team’s second contest, the Dunster resident did it all, notching a sack, an interception, and seven tackles en route to an Ivy League Defensive Player of the Week nod.
With the announcement of first and second All-Ivy teams earlier this week, honors this week weren’t limited to the seniors and Schneider. On the offensive side, junior tight end Kyle Juszczyk and Murphy were named to the all-Ivy first team, while Ortiz, Gedeon, and Hanson received first-team defensive honors. Ortiz and Hanson made the team unanimously.
A host more Crimson players made the Ivy second team, including Winters, junior offensive lineman Jack Holuba, junior running back Treavor Scales, junior defensive tackle Nnamdi Obukwelu, and junior defensive back Brian Owusu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PARADISE ISLAND, Bahamas—The Harvard men's basketball team hasn't had the best luck in tournaments as of late. For two years in a row, the Crimson has fallen flat in postseason competition—in 2009-10, the CollegeInsider.com Tournament, then in last year's National Invitation Tournament.
All of which makes Thursday evening's 75-47 drubbing of Utah in the first round of the first-ever Battle 4 Atlantis tournament even more encouraging.
"It's nice to get a nice, well-played performance—and a win—in a tournament as your first game," Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. "We talk a lot about gaining momentum within a tournament, and I thought our kids came with a great deal of energy, and we started out terrific on the defensive end, which led to a lot of transition plays for us."
In just seven minutes following the opening tip, the Crimson (4-0) had opened up a 17-4 advantage over the hapless Utes (1-3), who turned it over six times in the span. A three-pointer by Utah's Chris Hines cut the deficit to 14, but a three-pointer by Harvard freshman Corbin Miller then made it 24-7 in favor of the Ancient Eight representatives, and after that, the rout was on. Harvard led at halftime, 49-24.
Co-captain Keith Wright led the way for the Crimson with 13 points and seven rebounds. Fellow front-court bruiser Kyle Casey had 11 points, seven boards, and three assists in 18 minutes of action. Miller, a Utah native, was next up with a career-high 13 points on 3-of-3 shooting from behind the arc.
Firmly in a rebuilding year under first-year coach Larry Krystowiak, the Utes were not expected to provide much of a challenge for the Ivy League favorite. The Pac-12 newcomers lived up to the lack of hype, allowing Harvard to shoot 18-of-33 (54.5 percent) from the floor in the first period and forcing just eight turnovers the whole game. Guard Josh Watkins once again led his team offensively, dropping 12 points, but failed to reach his lofty scoring average of 21 and had five turnovers.
"I think we came out a little sluggish but at the end, we fought," said Watkins, whose team has now lost three straight. "If we had played with the same intensity [in the first that we did in the second], it'd be a much closer game, and the outcome would probably be different."
Regardless of the caliber of its opponent, Harvard's ability to shake off any jitters about playing on national television—in a converted hotel ballroom seating 4,000 spectators, no less—was encouraging for Amaker, who notched a win over a Power Six-conference opponent for the fifth straight year.
"Maybe in years past it would have been a good draw to play Harvard, but right now it's a pretty well-oiled machine," Krystowiak said. "I think they're going to have a really successful year, and I wouldn't be surprised if they made some more noise in this tournament."
By midway through the second half, with the game's outcome no longer in doubt, Amaker felt comfortable enough to give double-digit minutes to a lineup of four freshmen—Miller, Wesley Saunders, Steve Moundou-Missi, Jonah Travis—and sophomore wing Laurent Rivard, who came off the bench to contribute six points.
It was that kind of night, one that allowed Amaker to rest his starters in anticipation of facing a much tougher opponent less than 24 hours later.
Harvard will face No. 22 Florida State Friday at 4:30 p.m. in the tournament semifinals after the Seminoles dismantled UMass Thursday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PARADISE ISLAND, Bahamas—The Harvard men’s basketball team’s 75-47 win over Utah last night marked more than just a first-round victory at the inaugural Battle 4 Atlantis tournament. It also gave the Crimson a win over a BCS-conference opponent for the fifth straight season.
Since taking over the program in 2007, Harvard ‘s Tommy Amaker has coached the Crimson to a 6-8 record against opponents from the Power-Six conferences: Big East, ACC, Big 10, Big XII, SEC, and Pac-12.
In Amaker’s first season in Cambridge, Harvard surprised the Big Ten’s Michigan at Lavietes Pavilion. One year later, Jeremy Lin ’10 and the Crimson shocked then-No. 17 Boston College, besting the ACC Eagles on their home court.
Since its first victory, Harvard has posted road victories over Boston College in each of the last two seasons. Additionally the Crimson toppled Colorado—then a member of the Big XII—last season, marking two BCS wins.
Amaker made it five years in a row last night with the win over Utah, which recently joined the Pac-12. The win improves the Crimson’s all-time record against current members of the Pac-12 to 2-19.
“It certainly was a nice win for us over a BCS-conference school,” said Amaker of last night’s win. “We’re establishing ourselves as a program that, whoever we play, we think we’re going to be competitive.”
The Crimson will get another crack at BCS-conference opponent Friday afternoon when Harvard faces No. 22 Florida State of the ACC. If Harvard were to defeat the Seminoles—a tall task—the Crimson would likely face the Big East’s UConn, giving Harvard three BCS matchups in as many days.
WATKINS GLEN
A key for the Crimson in last night’s matchup was stopping Utah Josh Watkins. Watkins, a 6'0 guard, entered yesterday’s contest averaging a team-best 21.3 points per game.
“The kid Watkins is a very good player,” Amaker said. “He’s strong; he’s fast with the ball; he can drive it; he’s crafty.”
But thanks in large part to the defensive efforts of junior point guard Brandyn Curry, Watkins was, in effect, neutralized.
In 24 minutes, Watkins posted 12 points on as many shots and recorded five turnovers.
“We talked about that being the key matchup for us in this game,” said Amaker of the Curry-Watkins matchup. “[Curry’s] ability to guard Watkins, I thought, was the key to [last night’s] win.”
Curry got off to a hot start on both ends of the floor, scoring seven of the Crimson’s first 11 points and contributing to Watkins’s 0-for-5 shooting performance to open the contest.
“I just wanted to set the pace, be aggressive on defense and offense,” said Curry, who finished with nine points, three assists, and two turnovers. “That was my mindset going into the game.”
SUPER FROSH
Harvard’s seven rookies saw more action last night than in any of the Crimson’s previous three contests. All seven took the court, while four—Steve Moundou-Missi, Corbin Miller, Jonah Travis, and Wesley Saunders—saw significant minutes.
“I thought they played well in stretches,” said Amaker, who sent out a lineup that featured four rookies and sophomore Laurent Rivard on a number of occasions.
Miller, a native of Sandy, Utah, had a solid performance against the opponents from his home state. The 6’2 sharpshooter posted a career-high 13 points, which tied him with co-captain Keith Wright for the game high.
Miller connected on five of six shots from the field, including all three he took from beyond the arc.
“I thought Corbin came in and showed a lot of poise, made a few shots,” Amaker said. “I was really happy for him.”
The coach was less pleased with the performances he received from Harvard’s other rookies. While Travis and Moundou-Missi scrapped, combining for 13 rebounds, Amaker would like to see them finish better at the basket. Of their combined 10 attempts from the field, Travis and Moundou-Missi converted just three.
“They need to finish better, but that’s going to be something that’s going to take a little time for our younger players,” Amaker said.
Saunders, the Crimson’s fourth impact rookie, had a relatively quiet night. After scoring 10 crucial points in Harvard’s Nov. 16 victory over Holy Cross, Saunders was held to a single point in 18 minutes.
“We need to have more consistent performances from Wesley Saunders,” Amaker said. “I think he’s capable of giving us a lot.”

They call it the 'mo. Mutton chops, handlebars, Fu Manchu—the time-honored mustache has drifted in and out of style. But in November, men around the world throw down their razors and bring back the 'stache.
Many of these men choose embrace their upper lip hair-growing abilities as part of Movember, a month-long celebration to raise awareness about prostate cancer and other men's health concerns.
According to the Movember Foundation, "Mo Bros effectively become walking, talking billboards for the 30 days of November."
Students all across campus are growing their mustaches out, some for charity and some just for the fun of it.
We had the exclusive opportunity to interview one of these men. Ryan M. Grimshaw '11, captain of the men's hockey team and pioneer in The Art of Not Shaving, is leading the entire team in Movember, heading the collection of donations for prostate cancer research and men's health awareness.
Why Movember?
"Movember" or "No Shave November" is a big thing in the hockey world, so we've done it the last couple of years—not for charity or anything, but just kind of joking around. This year, we decided to actually do something with it.
Do you normally grow out your facial hair?
I'll usually go a couple of weeks growing out my facial hair, but it's a little different when it's a mustache. A little more attention to that.
Does your mustache have a name?
Last year, when we did this, a kid on our team—one of the French kids, our goalie Raphael Girard—he started calling me Handlebar Jim because of the handles, so I guess that would be the name for it. Handlebar Jim. I don't know. He thought it made sense.
Has your mustache helped your game on the ice?
It definitely helps with team chemistry. I don't think you see anything on the ice from it, but I think it does kind of make for a more enjoyable atmosphere in the room. Kids come in every day, and they'll have a little mustache and they'll grow it out for a week with a shape or something. It does make it more funny and you can ease back on that when it gets more stressful.
 
Has your mustache helped your game with the ladies off the ice?
I wish it could. I don't know. It definitely gets the attention of them, but I don't know if it's for the good reasons. It's not exactly the best looking thing, I think.
Do you have any mustache-related pick-up lines?
No. Nothing like Ron Burgundy or anything.
If you could have any famous person's mustache, whose would you pick?
I don't know a lot of mustaches that are famous, but I would say, from the hockey world, George Parros. He's from the [Anaheim] Ducks. He's always a famous guy during this whole Movember thing. He always sports a huge mustache during the season. It's pretty big.
How are you going to feel when it's time to say goodbye to Handlebar Jim?
I might miss it a bit. I think we've grown attached in the past couple of weeks. It ends with November, so still a week and a half to go. I'm going to a kid on our team's Thanksgiving, and I'm not sure what they're going to think of it at dinner, with all the relatives there and the mustached kids in the room.

If you're sticking around campus for Turkey Day, you can enjoy plenty of holiday happenings without bursting out of the Harvard bubble.
 
Thursday: Take advantage of the forecasted sunshine to toss a football around in the Yard (just mind the tents). Next, head to Adams—the only dining hall open on the holiday—for some Thanksgiving grub. 
 
After dinner, work off that turkey with a stroll through the Adams tunnels. Check out the mural on "Things to Do Before You Graduate" by Courtenay L. Kessler '03, which illustrates suggestions like fiddling with Claverly's elevator, playing Frisbee at midnight, and participating in primal scream. If you're still feeling energetic despite the tryptophan, you could even start scratching a few of the items of the list.
 
Friday: Get swept away in Black Friday madness right in the Square. Or if you aren't in the market for chaos, enjoy refined afternoon tea and cookies at the IOP from 3 to 6 p.m.
 
On Friday and Saturday, you can also check out the Cultural Survival Bazaar at Cambridge College, featuring crafts and performances from those groups that celebrated the first Thanksgiving.
 
Saturday: Whatever your partisan leanings, the political comedy troupe "Capitol Steps" is sure to get your vote. Discounted student tickets for the shows at 5 and 8 p.m. in Sanders are available at the Harvard Box Office.
 
Sunday: Finish off the weekend by showing your support for Harvard Athletics. Cheer the women's basketball team to victory in the 2 p.m. matchup against Holy Cross, then watch women’s hockey take on Minnesota at 4 p.m.
