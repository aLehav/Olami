After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the 21st century, the dilemma facing many opera companies around the world is how to refresh centuries-old operas to appeal to a modern audience. Giacomo Puccini’s masterpiece “La Bohème,” one of the most beloved pieces in the classical repertoire, has been a particular target of such reimaginings. Past productions have seen the tragic tale of impoverished artists in 1830s Paris interpreted as everything from a wordless ballet set in the 1950s to a futuristic love story that unfolds in outer space. These adaptations have been met with varying degrees of affection from die-hard opera fans, but Boston Lyric Opera’s excellent and unorthodox staging of “La Bohème” is sure to please even the most staunch opera purists.
Produced in conjunction with Detroit Opera and Spoleto Festival USA, stage director Yuval Sharon’s visionary interpretation of the classic opera stages its events in reverse chronology. The performance begins where Puccini’s original work ends — with Mimì’s (Lauren Michelle) tragic death in Act IV — and moves backward in time from there, culminating with ill-fated lovers Mimì and Rodolfo’s (Jesus Garcia) first meeting in Act I. Besides this restructuring, Puccini’s music is relatively untouched, save some generous cuts in Act I that slim the opera’s runtime down to a trim 100 minutes with no intermission — an impressive feat for a show that usually commands almost three hours, and likely an attempt to make the production more accessible to new audience members.
Bohème’s episodic construction beautifully lends itself to this reverse-linear adaptation. The libretto, which is based on the French play “Scènes de la Vie Bohème” by Henri Murger, is structured in a series of vignettes that could easily stand on their own, allowing each act to retain its emotional poignancy despite the Boston adaptation’s reversal in chronology. Additionally, the movement of the stage, which is built on a rotating, circular platform, helps orient the audience through the changes in time, while shifts in lighting transition us from the bleak days of sickness and financial stress to the rose-colored scenes of young love, and add nuance to the otherwise minimalist set.
Yuval Sharon’s adaptation also includes the addition of a new character called “The Wanderer” (Marshall Hughes) who provides spoken English-language introductions to each new act. Though The Wanderer is helpful in guiding the audience through time jumps, his additional appearances throughout the opera are superfluous at best and distracting at worst, especially in instances where his lines, often in the form of rhetorical questions, interject in key moments of the opera’s action.
Despite the interruptions, Boston Lyric Opera’s production of “La Bohème” was triumphant, fresh, and touching. For an opera so prominent in the cultural milieu, starting with Mimì’s death is not a “spoiler,” but has the effect of shadowing the rest of the opera with a potent bittersweet atmosphere not present in other productions. A scene particularly of note is Mimì’s famous aria “Sì, mi chiamano Mimì.” This scene is usually a charming introduction to her character, but in Boston Lyric Opera’s production, it functions as a touching eulogy to a woman gone too soon. Additionally, key symbols such as Mimì’s pink bonnet take on new meaning after the audience sees their significance at the end of Mimì’s life.
As for the cast, Lauren Michelle as Mimì is a clear standout. Michelle has a voice that brings tears to the eyes and shivers down the spine; her excellent, soaring soprano never falters despite the physical demands of portraying a character dying of tuberculosis and prone to violent coughing fits and sudden fainting spells. The rest of the cast has excellent chemistry and impressive vocal power, and reflects Boston Lyric Opera’s recent commitment to make opera a more inclusive space for people of all backgrounds and identities.
“La Bohème” has graced the stages of opera houses across the world for over a century, and differentiating a new production of the opera from the scores of earlier iterations is no easy task. However, Boston Lyric Opera and Yuval Sharon rise to the occasion spectacularly, bringing the timeless story of love and loss to audiences in a way never before seen without compromising Puccini’s original vision.

“This is something we all do, cope by aestheticizing our pain,” writes author and journalist Larissa Pham in her second work, the memoir-in-essays “Pop Song: Adventures in Art and Intimacy.” With unsettling vulnerability, Pham recounts key memories and incorporates art criticism as a tool for reflection. While the memoir should be applauded for its poetic prose, intelligence, and raw honesty that will certainly resonate with young readers grappling with hurtful experiences, Pham’s vulnerability borders on trauma porn. The reader suffers with her past self, constantly hoping for her to put an end to her self-destructive behaviors, but the essays recount Pham’s memories with too little reflection and character development. Because of the narrator’s aversion to growing from her experiences, reliving her painful past is frustrating and distressing rather than insightful.
“Pop Song” starts with Pham’s time as an undergraduate at Yale, where she uses running and casual sex as a means of self-transcendence and of evading the discrimination she faces as a Vietnamese-American woman. She feels out of place, and faces both sexual abuse and degrading indifference from the men in her life.
The theme of self-evasion continues throughout the book: Pham takes the reader from New Haven to Taos, France, and Shanghai, from her time as a college student to the years beyond, always running from herself and her pain, which tragically and ironically leads to even more pain. She deals with anorexia, constantly gets into abusive and exploitative relationships, and uses BDSM as a way to degrade herself. One of the most distressing passages is about her fascination with female self-mortification and the artistic depiction of bruised women.
Art criticism, as yet another form of self-transcendence, plays a major role in the memoir: “I wanted so badly to connect to something, to recognize myself where I didn’t have the words to express.” Turning to the works of others as a lens to understand her own pain, the incorporation of art criticism is a refreshing choice that is well supported by the personal essay format. However, many of these passages — such as a ten-page biography of the abstract painter Agnes Martin — are tedious for readers without a deep interest in the visual arts. The book’s drawn-out, vigorous passages analyzing art starkly contrast the narrator’s detached evasion of reflecting on and growing from her personal experiences. Yet, “Pop Song” would have greatly benefited from the opposite structure — less art criticism and more original introspection.
The author’s relationship with a former lover — whom she addresses as “You” — serves as the essays’ sweet and remedial red thread. With graceful prose and allusions to Anne Carson’s essay “Eros the Bittersweet,” Pham describes how she, after all the abusive, casual relationships she’s been in, was hesitant to open up and allow herself to fall in love. When she finally does, the two form a bond that helps the narrator heal and process past grievances. At the same time, she admits that this relationship is another act of self-delusion as she tries to will into existence a perfection and permanence that love does not possess.
Ultimately, Pham’s distortion of reality and the man’s refusal to commit to her lead to a breakup that forces her to finally come to terms with her pain on her own. These last pages contain some much-needed development of the narrator’s self-confidence and intriguing introspection as she realizes, “I’m scared that the self stops existing without a story to tell about it. So I have my own anxious response: weaving, weaving, weaving my own narrative.”
Unfortunately, these realizations are too little, too late to reward the reader for the agonizing journey of “Pop Song.” On a positive note, Pham’s masterful prose sustains the reader’s interest, and her experiences might act as a deterrent against self-delusive, self-destructive coping strategies. Nevertheless, the book feels too much like a diary entry to chronicle and process the author’s life, rather than insightful essays that will benefit those going through similar struggles.

For most Harvard students, Harvard University Dining Services, or HUDS, provides the vast majority of our daily nutrition, for better or for worse, in sickness or in health, and until graduation do us part. But perhaps students haven’t been making the most of their unlimited swipes. Read further for a thorough and painstaking journey through Harvard’s upperclassmen cuisine — as presented to you by a fearless first-year with a uniquely unbiased perspective on the matter.
Each rating is based on three categories: Food, overall taste and texture; Ambience, physical presence of the dining hall; and Experience, flow, functionality, and layout.
12. Adams: It’s like eating in a castle, but at what cost?
Food: 2.0/5.0
Ambience: 4.0/5.0
Experience: 1.5/5.0
This dining hall was a place of high highs and low lows. A plate of steamed kale, chicken parmesan, chicken a la plancha, and braised pork bondiola had little to offer aside from a brackish flavor palette. Considering that the only way to get in as a first-year is to lie and say you live in Pforzheimer House… well, Adams was not worth the trouble.
11. Cabot: In this case, no press is bad press.
Food: 3.0/5.0
Ambience: 2.5/5.0
Experience: 3.5/5.0
A lunch of BBQ turkey tips, roasted brussels sprouts, carrots and leeks, cherrystones, white bean escarole, and alu chole was deeply unexceptional. Despite house pride, outdoor seating, and a nice overall flow to the space, the cafeteria feel was overwhelming, reminiscent of a high school lunchroom fitted with cork boards, long plywood tables, and empty white walls.
10. Kirkland: Lowell, but less grandiose.
Food: 3.5/5.0
Ambience: 3.0/5.0
Experience: 3.0/5.0
With smaller tables than Lowell House, Kirkland has a more intimate community atmosphere, but its warm soda and complete lack of napkins on the tables might just cancel that out. Spicy chicken stir-fry, stir-fried green beans, and jasmine rice provide depths of flavors and textures — but the fried calamari and grilled chicken unfortunately did not.
9. Eliot: All ambience, all flow.
Food: 2.5/5.0
Ambience: 4.0/5.0
Experience: 3.5/5.0
This meal began with an interrogation from a HUDS worker, culminating in a second lie about living in Pfoho. Eliot’s ravioli, garlic mashed potatoes, roast beef, and locally-caught fresh fish just didn’t hit the mark. What Eliot missed in cuisine, it made up for in ambience, delivering a spacious kitchen and a mix of tables that eliminate a cafeteria feel.
8. Pforzheimer: Home, sweet (P)home
Food: 3.5/5.0
Ambience: 3.0/5.0
Experience: 3.5/5.0
Food is the tiebreaker between Eliot and Pfoho. Creamy garlic pasta, marinara, juicy meatballs, flavorful ratatouille, and herb-roasted chicken with cacciatore sauce made the quad dining hall experience thoroughly enjoyable. While the cute bistro-esque kitchen doesn’t make up for the bland dining area, the two-storied room makes for a varied and interesting experience.
7. Mather: Easy on the stomach, less so on the eyes.
Food: 4.5/5.0
Ambience: 3.5/5.0
Experience: 3.5/5.0
Frittata, french toast, farfalle, pork sausage, and hash browns — all thoroughly delicious in their own right. Yet, the seating in Mather is incredibly cramped and it doesn’t have much to offer visually. Despite a large influx of natural light, the overabundance of concrete and gray carpeted floor doesn’t scream “bon appetit.”
6. Quincy: Feels like college, but tastier.
Food: 4.0/5.0
Ambience: 4.0/5.0
Experience: 4.0/5.0
An enjoyable space with even better food: Tofu curry noodle stir fry, cabbage, beer battered and fried fish, and tartar sauce create a salty and savory flavor profile. The dan dan noodles were saline and the meatballs dry, but were made up for by the modern mural filling the far wall, making for a colorful, abstract, and controversial conversation piece. Perhaps tablemates can bond over trying to decipher the image.
5. Leverett: As exclusive as it is tasty.
Food: 4.0/5.0
Ambience: 4.5/5.0
Experience: 4.0/5.0
Roasted spicy potatoes, tuscan butter salmon, farro with mushroom and tomato, and harissa chicken thigh all delivered a creamy, aromatic, herbal, and flavorful combination. The space is gorgeous and covered in emerald Leverett banners — still, there’s better, more available dining elsewhere.
4. Winthrop: Better than Leverett, less hassle.
Food: 4.5/5.0
Ambience: 4.5/5.0
Experience: 4.0/5.0
Winthrop had the same food as Leverett, only whipped potatoes instead of roasted — making them creamy, delicate, and delightful. Winthrop marginally outperformed Leverett in flavor and texture; the half-underground dining hall did not disappoint.
3. Lowell: Looks like “Pride and Prejudice,” tastes like heaven.
Food: 4.0/5.0
Ambience: 5.0/5.0
Experience: 4.0/5.0
An inconvenient dish return system is made up for by superb chicken tikka masala, barley hash, and alu chole, as well as a stunning yellow and white interior. The salmon with green curry might be the best-cooked fish from HUDS yet though the flavor leaves something to be desired.
2. Currier: Worth the walk.
Food: 5.0/5.0
Ambience: 4.0/5.0
Experience: 5.0/5.0
Currier is delicious. Creamy garlic pasta, aromatic herb roasted chicken with cacciatore sauce, well-cooked yellowtail flounder, delightfully umami ratatouille with chickpeas. Paired with a calming and comfortable atmosphere, there’s (almost) nothing better.
1. Dunster: Leaves Currier outperformed.
Food: 5.0/5.0
Ambience: 5.0/5.0
Experience: 4.5/5.0
Dunster is the best dining on campus. A seitan quesadilla, basmati rice, coconut curry chicken, chicken thigh, and cauliflower delivered a cohesive yet varied flavor profile unlike other dining halls. Add to the equation boom-boom sauce, found in only a few dining halls, and the luscious, dark wood that frames the space, and you’ll have a truly wonderful lunch or dinner.

Bold and ambitious, Roger Reeves’s second poetry collection “Best Barbarian” is a triumphant testament to the power of the Black voice. Reeves forges ahead and puts forth an intense body of work that examines issues of race, war, and even climate change without compromising its lyricism. Recipient of a Whiting Award and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Poetry Foundation, Reeves is gripping in his examination of the apocalyptic state of humanity, making it impossible for the reader to look away.
Ruminations on abstract concepts like death, loss, grief, and pain become achingly familiar as Reeves’s speakers trace the contours of their familial history. At the beginning of the collection, the speaker grapples with the complicated entanglements of lineage and trauma in poems such as “The Alphabet, For Naima,” “In Rehearsal For The Funeral,” and “After The Funeral.” The death of a father casts a shadow that is felt throughout the collection, but it never feels repetitive. The undercurrent of pain runs through the piece in an electric display of creativity, whether it's in contrast to his daughter’s “invisible breathing” in “After Death” or by taking the form of the German Feldgeister in “Cocaine and Gold” — his dead “father the corn-wolf”.
As much as it is personal, Reeves’s depiction of suffering is not strictly individualistic. His poetry engages with a range of global literature and contemporary issues as well. His examination of the assassination of the Palestinian writer in “The End of Ghassan Kanafani” broadens into a consideration of the painful consequences of war. Likewise, in “Children Listen,” the poem spans the “Roman sky” to “Gaza” to Kazimierz,” imbuing his rallying imperative “You must grow wildly over the graves” with a universal quality. He captures microscopic and macroscopic perspectives with ease.
Featuring frequent allusions to the Anglocentric literary canon, Reeves pushes his writing to its creative limits, constantly incorporating different voices with remarkable freshness. These span from Beowulf to the Bible and from Augustine to Walt Whitman. By engaging with these works, he places his own poetry in conversation with a canon that has been historically exclusionary. This ambitious undertaking leads to a fascinating exploration of the potential of Black poetry — able to simultaneously accommodate and interrogate the cornerstones of Western history and culture. Noticeably longer than the other poems in the collection, there are echoes of epic poetry in “Domestic Violence,” where named characters move alongside literary allusions and victims of police brutality, framed by epigraphs from Dante’s “Divine Comedy” and “The Kybalion.” Allegorical, dense, symbolic, and esoteric: It is this very complexity that insists the reader slows down and takes the time to consider the many connections Reeves creates between the past and the present.
What stands out is the way Reeves’s voice holds its own even as it draws upon giants in literary history. In “Fragment 107,” he gives Sappho’s disembodied voice a new life as he addresses her directly: “Do I long for my virginity, Sappho?” This strength of voice reaches its fever pitch in “Prayer Of The Jaguar,” where the speaker appropriates the symbol of the jaguar to embody his voice’s precise and calculated power: “the golden heaven rising / Above him, the hush of a slamming door.” It is in these depictions of nature that Reeves’ poeticism shines through. The world, through his eyes, is at once beautiful and traumatic, sometimes in inseparably complex ways. As such, natural imagery intermingles with contemporary injustice in “Rat Among The Pines.”
Moreover, the power of his voice also draws strength from the Black canon Reeves evokes. References to legendary artists like Aretha Franklin, Louis Armstrong, James Baldwin, Marion Brown, Beyoncé, and others position the collection amidst a celebration of Black artistic excellence. Specifically, in “Something About John Coltrane,” Reeves transfigures a pivotal moment in Black history — Mahalia Jackson’s wig flying off in the heat of performance — into a transcendent act of liberation. Here, the act of “Jackson’s wig flying” is “as if a star / Suddenly freed from the mouth of God / A Black tooth blessing.” His words strike at something beyond, mining the ordinary for moments of divinity.
To cover all the nuances of a book mired in historical, literary, and religious contexts is impossible in a review or even a singular thesis. This complexity does not mean that casual readers should be put off. The richness of his descriptive imagery, the vulnerability of his personal narratives, and his concerted engagement with contemporary issues are accessible and universal. This is a collection that warrants multiple re-readings, each time with new insights to be discovered within his lush words. As he says in the collection’s final poem, “You are in a beautiful language.” It is truly a marvel to behold.

There is something special about a TV show that is able to capture the essence of fall — a season that represents both new beginnings and nostalgic endings. As the leaves change colors and the days grow shorter, we seek even more comfort and escapism from our screens. Indeed, one of the best ways to get into the fall spirit without leaving the comfort of your bed is by watching TV shows that either take place in fall or simply make you feel warm and cozy inside. Here are seven of the best shows to binge this fall.
“The Sex Lives of College Girls” (HBO Max) 
“The Sex Lives of College Girls” (HBO Max) 
The first season of “The Sex Lives of College Girls” follows four characters throughout their first semester at Essex College. With colorful fall scenery as well as soccer games, costume parties, and new roommates, this comedy paints an awkwardly accurate picture of freshman fall. In addition to its campus setting, the show is especially bingeable for busy college students: There are 10 episodes (nine of which are only 30 minutes), so this show can easily be finished in one week or less. After binging Season One, viewers can look forward to season two which is set to premiere later this year.
“One Tree Hill” (Hulu)
“One Tree Hill” (Hulu)
With its North Carolina fall and winter visuals, the iconic soundtrack, and plenty of angst, “One Tree Hill” is a great fall watch for first-time viewers and longtime fans alike. It is a soapy teen drama with elements of romance and a cast of lovable characters, following estranged half brothers Lucas and Nathan Scott who become teammates on their school’s basketball team. The development of their relationship, as well as the other relationships they build throughout the show, is heartwarming to follow and a necessary contrast to the endless roadblocks they encounter.
“Los Espookys” (HBO Max)
“Los Espookys” (HBO Max)
If you’re looking for a comedy to get you in the mood for Halloween, look no further than HBO’s “Los Espookys.” The show manages to balance its sophisticated yet simple humor with colorfully creepy visuals. Renaldo, the main character, and his friends Úrsula, Tati, and Andrés go into the horror business together, hired to scare people in wacky ways. Three episodes of Season Two have been released so far, so now is a great time to start watching.
“This is Us” (Hulu)
“This is Us” (Hulu)
“Gilmore Girls” might not be on this list, but Milo Ventamiglia has still made his way onto it. “This is Us” is rich with fall visuals as well as family drama — and impeccable performances from Sterling K. Brown and Mandy Moore. The bonds between the characters are touching, and their individual and familial development are realistic. It is hard not to get attached to the family or reflect on your own family, as the show is centered around these relationships and memories, as nearly every episode features a storyline in the form of a flashback. There is an overarching theme of gratitude even during tough times, making this show a great sentimental watch leading up to Thanksgiving.
“Hyouka” (Crunchyroll)
“Hyouka” (Crunchyroll)
This pick is all about vibes and visuals. “Hyouka” centers on freshman Oreki Hotarou and the other members of their school’s Classic Literature club as they solve mysteries together. The show depicts the randomness of friendships forged in school clubs through a cast of relatable characters who are well-developed over the show’s 22 episodes. Kyoto Animation is responsible for the show’s visually appealing animation style, which features vibrant warm tones, and the soundtrack is well-suited to the show’s slice of life and mystery form.
“Over the Garden Wall” (HBO Max)
“Over the Garden Wall” (HBO Max)
This animated miniseries follows two brothers trying to find their way out of the woods. The episodes are short – around 11 minutes each – but the compelling side characters the two brothers encounter make the episodes feel longer in the best way possible. Like many other Cartoon Network series, the show succeeds at getting a deeper message across in each episode, touching on subjects such as death, hopefulness, and brotherhood. “Over the Garden Wall” also has a beautiful autumnal color palette of reds, browns, oranges, and greens that fades into colder colors as the season progresses.
“Once Upon a Time” (Disney+) 
“Once Upon a Time” (Disney+) 
ABC’s fantasy drama series “Once Upon a Time” offers a refreshingly human take on familiar fairytale characters like Belle, Prince Charming, and Captain Hook. The show adds a level of complexity unseen in the original stories, as the “good guys” have flaws and the villains are given opportunities to redeem themselves. This show will bring you back to childhood, invested in whether or not Snow White eats the Evil Queen’s apple. The nostalgia evoked by the characters coupled with the New England fall setting make this show a perfect fall watch.

Known for its extravagant Y2K fashion, early-age flip phones, and often ridiculous plot lines, “Gossip Girl” is widely regarded as a defining series of a generation. 15 years after the show’s pilot aired on the CW, “Gossip Girl” still remains a cultural emblem of the 2000s, alongside shows like “Pretty Little Liars” and “The Vampire Diaries.” Its content has resurfaced in memes like “Go piss, girl,” as well as inspired a reboot series under the same name, which aired on HBO Max in the summer of 2021.
It’s important to note that the show is outdated in many ways: One has to question the prevailing relevance of “Gossip Girl” in today's cultural landscape. The show depicts an incredibly niche social group (the filthy rich teens of the Upper East Side) and features an almost exclusively white main cast. As such, one might assume “Gossip Girl” would’ve lost its widespread appeal by now, but it’s held its own as a time capsule of sorts — acutely aware of its lack of touch with reality, the show’s glamorous, over-the-top fashion choices and aesthetics have prevailed, while its elitist lens and whitewashed cast have remained in the past.
Regardless of these major flaws, “Gossip Girl” exercised widespread influence over the fashion choices and social lens of a whole generation of teens and adults. Indeed, over three million viewers tuned in during the show’s first season to follow the ritzy and chaotic lives of sunny Serena van der Woodsen (Blake Lively), “queen bee” Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester), “lonely boy” Dan Humphrey (Penn Badgeley) and (incredibly problematic) rebel Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick). The New York Magazine crowned “Gossip Girl” as “The Most Important Show of Our Time” in 2007, and the show’s relevance in media discourse serves to somewhat support the title.
The cultural influence of “Gossip Girl” on other teen television shows and fashion trends has indeed not gone away. Many of the tropes that appeared in “Gossip Girl” persist: One can draw a clear comparison between Blair and Serena’s frenemy relationship and that of Maddy and Cassie in the much more recent teen drama “Euphoria.” Furthermore, the show’s distinct fashion was incredibly influential at its time of release (consider Target’s Gossip Girl collaboration in 2009). And in recent years, the low rise jeans, loud patterns, and baby tees worn by the Upper East Side cast have made a return to the mainstream with the resurgence of Y2K fashion. Although the particular storylines and content of the original “Gossip Girl” have mostly lost their relevance over the past 15 years, the show’s cultural and stylistic impacts endure to this day.
The fact that the actual storylines of “Gossip Girl” have faded to the background over the years is by no means surprising. Although the show stayed consistent in its concept throughout the first two seasons — a dramatic build up to a party or event that would inevitably go awry, accompanied by tiffs, alliances, and much-dreaded anonymous gossip impeccably voiced by Kristen Bell — the show ultimately lost focus in its narrative. Consider the appearance of Serena and Dan’s half brother in season three, or Dan and Vanessa’s (played by Jessica Szohr) threesome with Hillary Duff. Or the death and revival and ultimate death of Bart Bass (Robert John Burke), or the woman who may or may not be Chuck’s mother, ultimately revealing that she was before disappearing permanently from the show. It’s clear that Chuck’s myriad of back-and-forth parental issues throughout the later seasons is a result of thinning plot-lines and over-run character arcs. The same conclusion could probably be made for the sheer quantity of love triangles that develop between the six main cast members (there is no alternative justification for Dan and Blair’s relationship in season five).
Unfortunately, HBO Max’s reboot of “Gossip Girl” ultimately fails to correct the wrongs of the original series. Although it retains the charm and intrigue of the lives of the Upper East Side youth and is substantially more diverse in its casting and representation, the reboot falls victim to many of the same elitist roadblocks of the original, but without its early 2000s charm and then-scandalous appeal. Introducing a single character of slightly lower financial status into the mix doesn’t work to fully ground a story otherwise populated by unimaginably wealthy Manhattan teens — especially when those outsider characters (Dan Humphrey in the original, Zoya Lott (played by Whitney Peak) in the reboot) still manage to live in spacious, gorgeous apartments in Brooklyn and the Upper West Side. All in all, the concept of “Gossip Girl,” although self aware in its removal from most peoples’ reality, can still be hard to empathize with at times. The show retains its relevance as a cultural icon of a time that has passed, but it does not need to be repeated or redone.
15 years after the show’s debut, “Gossip Girl” serves as a specific time capsule for a specific era: An escapist delve into the dark sides of emerging social media amongst a group of teens that didn’t yet know how to handle it. It is safe to bet that “Gossip Girl” will resurface in television tropes and Halloween costumes well into the future, but its overall content is best left behind us.

A true crime obsession lurks in the shadows of the collective American consciousness weaving through movie plots and infesting Netflix algorithms. Call it morbid or fascinating, this explosion of content is inescapable.
“Not everybody can forget,” says Glenda Cleveland (Niecy Nash) in the new Netflix series, “Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story.” Although she was referring to the families of Dahmer’s victims after his arrest, the same statement can be applied to the general public. Over 30 years after the Dahmer case, not only are the legacies of infamous killers like Dahmer still alive, but they are continually resurrected by popular culture. While there is no denying that these disturbing stories are alluring, the true crime genre also forces society to reckon with the cost of this entertainment and the irrevocable harm inflicted by this content on victims’ families.
True crime apologists typically argue that there is something intrinsic to human nature that causes us to enjoy being scared, and that the experience of horror is accompanied by an addictive morbid curiosity. This theory accounts for why readers keep returning to Stephen King’s novels after each scare, or why fans brave theaters for each terrifying new Jordan Peele film. Even in fictional crime TV shows like “Law and Order” and “Criminal Minds,” where the storylines are based on real criminal cases, the terror is formulaic and each episode gets wrapped up with a tidy bow. Consuming horror through fiction creates distance from reality and provides a reliable sense of escapism for viewers. After all, at any point, audiences can tap out by simply closing a book or pausing a movie. Whatever characters may experience within the plot, they are simply bone-chilling scares with no strings attached.
In stark contrast, true crime represents a collision with reality. Viewers crave becoming witnesses to the darkest sides of humanity, even if only through a television screen. Some true crime documentaries hinge on survivors’ stories, including Netflix’s “Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey,” which amassed a whopping 58 million viewing hours during the two weeks after its June release. This documentary is meant to shed light on the polygamist FLDS Church and its insidious leader Warren Jeffs through the eyes of former members who were often silenced. Similar fact-driven documentaries such as “Night Stalker: The Hunt for a Serial Killer,” “Abducted in Plain Sight,” and even “The Tinder Swindler,” responsibly focus on telling victims’ stories without trivializing the realities of the cases.
A far cry from these documentaries, however, is Netflix’s newest true crime series, “Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,” produced by Ryan Murphy, which presents a disturbing and almost glorifying characterization of Dahmer. Starring Evan Peters as Jeffrey Dahmer, the show immediately feels like another season of “American Horror Story,” the terrifying anthology series featuring Peters, which Murphy also produces. If Murphy simply wanted to explore a dark and challenging role for Peters, it is clear that he could have done so in a fictional work like those they have collaborated on in the past.
Although based in fact, “Monster” is in no way a documentary or even a drama docuseries, but a biopic of Jeffrey Dahmer himself. Following the killer throughout his entire life — from tumultuous childhood, to uncontrollable murder spree, and finally to his arrest — the show seems to be an attempt to humanize Dahmer through Peters’ compelling performance.
In terms of social commentary, the series focuses both on the experience of Dahmer’s neighbor, Glenda Cleveland, with the unresponsive and obviously negligent Milwaukee Police Department, but also the harrowing pattern of Dahmer’s victim choice. While it is extremely important to recognize the broken system that enabled Dahmer to prey predominantly on gay men of color, Murphy’s approach does little more than romanticize Dahmer’s story and potentially retraumatize victims’ families.
Most egregiously, since the evidence in the Dahmer case is in the public record, there was no requirement, or effort made by the show to consult victims’ families. Rita Isbell, sister of Errol Lindsey who was killed by Dahmer in 1991, was even portrayed in the show without her consent. Clearly, Murphy’s intention was not to honor the memories of Dahmer’s victims, and even his addition of a brief tribute at the very end of the show seems somewhat like an afterthought. A black screen with 17 photos and names relegated to the last possible moment so that it would not interfere with the narrative flow of Murphy’s story does little to express genuine concern.
True crime media creators are entrusted with an immense responsibility. When true crime gets it right, it can be an instrumental tool in amplifying unheard voices and portraying a more complete picture of criminal cases. But when it goes wrong, it can lead to leveraging of the sensationalism of criminal cases for personal or monetary gain, with no regard to the emotional and psychological damage of bringing infamous stories back to the forefront of popular culture. Perhaps Netflix executives have become so desensitized by the saturation of true crime in our culture that they failed to see that Murphy simply went too far in “Monster.” Or more cynically, perhaps they recognized that such a controversial series would likely spark an outrage which would only increase viewership. Either alternative is horrific and with such unethical manipulation, both Murphy and Netflix have taken true crime too far — into a genre that does more harm than good.

Do you even laugh, bro?
In “Bros,” the new romantic comedy from famed producer Judd Apatow, the answer to this question is a resounding “sometimes.” Billy Eichner, best known for his iconic series “Billy on the Street,” co-wrote the film’s screenplay and also stars as the sarcastic yet lovable protagonist Bobby Lieber. Despite constantly mentioning to his friends that he is “emotionally unavailable,” Bobby finds himself falling for Luke Macfarlane’s Aaron, a buff lawyer who also fears committing to their burgeoning relationship.
While the film is notable for being one of the first gay romantic comedies from a major studio, its boundary-breaking nature cannot make up for what it lacks in the way of consistent humor and strong performances.
By marketing itself as a new R-rated comedy from Eichner, one of the funniest and most boisterous comedians working today, “Bros” sets high expectations for the level of humor at which it will operate. And in many moments, this bar (or something near it) is reached, with Eichner’s highly niche popular culture quips hitting the mark. Specifically, Eichner’s jokes about having the lanky phsyique of a grown-up Evan Hansen, the cliché nature of “The Office” gifs, and straight actors playing gay characters to win Oscars were pitch perfect, eliciting the type of uproarious laughter from the audience that is increasingly rare in movie theaters today. Such sharp and observant sarcasm, which has always been Eichner’s trademark, certainly keeps the film afloat.
Unfortunately, these sporadic moments of laughter fail to make the movie consistently enjoyable, and it often suffers under the weight of its own mission to be a defining gay romantic comedy. While increased representation in Hollywood is undoubtedly a good thing, “Bros” feels slightly heavy-handed in its pursuit to remind audiences that they are watching a film about being gay in modern America. This singular focus seems to restrict some of Eichner’s obvious comedic talents, limitting the possibility for more subtle and varied cultural commentary that is not contingent on having an explicitly gay-centric punchline. (For evidence of a recent romantic comedy that achieves a greater level of nuance in its humorous analysis of the gay experience, viewers should watch Andrew Ahn’s “Fire Island.”)
Despite some of its comedic shortcomings, “Bros” largely succeeds at fulfilling its promise to be a romantic movie. The chemistry between Bobby and Aaron is playful and believable, leading the audience to be genuinely invested in the outcome of their predictably tumultuous relationship. It is in the realm of romance that the film explores the idiosyncrasies of the gay experience with far more thoughtfulness, as Eichner expertly hones in on the many differences between straight and gay relationships. Employing the ironic adage “love is not love,” the film foregrounds a diverse array of queer characters who share their experiences of romance with heartfelt meaning. The pinnacle of all these moments occurs when Bobby shares his self-confidence struggles with Aaron on a beach in Provincetown, by far the most moving and powerful scene in the film.
As for the acting — Eichner’s performance feels lived-in yet slightly strained, with moments of Bobby’s anger coming across as particularly shaky. However, all is forgiven when Eichner tosses out his masterfully searing criticism or a witty remark, often sealing the deal with a cartoonish eye roll. Macfarlane plays a hyper-masculine foil to the effusive Bobby, and he is perfectly adequate at slowly revealing glimpses of Aaron’s more vulnerable side. Aside from the two main characters, there are several well-placed cameos in the film, with Debra Messing and Bowen Yang providing particularly fantastic moments of engaging, unbridled comedic chaos.
Ultimately, “Bros” ends up being a rather run-of-the-mill romantic comedy, which would be entirely sufficient if it were not for the knowledge of Eichner’s remarkable comedic prowess. Audiences should be sure to familiarize themselves with “Billy on the Street” YouTube clips after the film, as that is the format where Eichner truly dazzles. However, no harm will come to those who buy a ticket for this movie and subject themselves to watching Bobby try to shove through a crowd of gay men in a club who just “can’t stop voguing,” and other such gags. Billy on the Big Screen may not change the world, but it’s an admirable attempt and a positive step towards greater inclusion in Hollywood.

“Please look forward to an album full of music that lives up to the reputation of the group and their unrivaled presence,” said YG Entertainment when teasing “Born Pink,” the comeback album from K-pop legends Blackpink. Indeed, the group’s highly anticipated album not only met the standards of a sophomore project two years in the making but also managed to exceed the impossibly high expectations from Blackpink fans (also known as Blinks) all over the world.
The title “Born Pink” is an ode to the natural talent and individuality of the girl group quartet composed of rapper/singer Jennie (Jennie Kim), rapper/dancer Lisa (Lalisa Manobal), and singers Jisoo (Jisoo Kim) and Rosé (Chae-young Park). Following their wildly successful 2022 debut album “The Album,” Blackpink was at risk of being overcast by the shadow of their own fame. As a result of that pressure, “Born Pink” has succeeded in recreating that same authentic, yet unpredictable Blackpink sound. Songs like “Pink Venom,” the hip-hop and K-pop fusion reminiscent of previous singles “How You Like That” and “Boombayah,” reinforce that quintessential YG rap talent. The sweltering bridge of Rose’s “I’m so rock ‘n’ roll!” is another testament to the group’s unwavering commitment to delivering vocal perfection. The last half a minute or so of “Shut Down” climaxes into bombastic beat drops that naturally give way to the high-energy dance break like a cherry on top of the group’s 2020 Selena Gomez collab “Ice Cream.” Likewise, the guitar-ridden ballad “Yeah Yeah Yeah” explores nerve-wracking feelings tangential to “The Album”’s “Lovesick Girls” with a similar pop-synth ballad melody.
However, the true strength of “Born Pink” lies in its innovation: It could not have been more artistically distinct — in the best way — from any project Blackpink has ever worked on before.
The production features a melting pot of genres: from classical-trap beat fusion on “Shut Down” to punkish rock ‘n’ roll on “Hard to Love,” stripped piano on “The Happiest Girl,” groovy EDM on “Ready For Love,” and ’90s grunge on “Tally.” Even in the tracks that reinforce Blackpink’s signature sound, the ingenuity doesn’t fail to shine through. “Pink Venom,” for example, could not be more Blackpink-esque, what with the catchy and repetitive chorus and earworm tune. Clearly, the girls have honed their algorithm to consistently produce chart-toppers.
That’s not to say the track plays it safe — on the contrary, the songwriting goes above and beyond. “Blackpink” is no longer “in your area,” because the girls have already arrived, according to the intro lyrics. Instead, chants of “Blackpink” grow louder with the pizzicato of the Geomungo, a traditional instrument played by Jisoo in the music video. The change could perhaps reflect their confidence growing as a result of being looked up to as professionals in the industry for so long. The rap verses also push the envelope, transgressing eras and cultures to pay a tribute to hip-hop legend 50 Cent in the line “You can’t get a dollar out of me” straight off “P.I.M.P,” and another nod to Rihanna in “It goes one by one and two by two” as the melody of “Pon De Replay” flirts in the background audio.
The sampling didn’t stop there: Throughout the album, classic snippets were transformed into modern tracks in ways that sounded both fresh and timeless. “Shut Down”’ features an (admittedly very short) soundbite from Franz Lizst’s “La Campanella” that looped into trap beats and 808s. On “Tally,” that stripped electric guitar loop native to any ballad was elevated into something modern and deeply nostalgic with the complex layering of swelling violins. "Typa Girl" consists of a simple piano tune that rings like a bell before the hi-hats and snares hit on the beat drop, gentle melody transforming into a whole new remastered MIDI sound. Although the mix of genres might not make for the most cohesive album, never knowing what to expect served as an effective device to enrapture listeners with the project.
Not only did Blackpink go out of their comfort zone with the production on "Born Pink," they also managed to push the boundaries in the K-pop industry. Releasing an explicit album that is mostly in English and features a solo member track (Rosé's "Hard To Love") is unheard of as far as the history of girl group comebacks go. The riskiness doesn’t stop there — according to long-time producer Teddy, much of the album was out of his hands when it came to the creative process. A pro of stepping out from that safe zone, the group had more of a say in the songwriting process than ever before — “Yeah Yeah Yeah” credits Rosé and Jisoo in writing the lyrics. The result is songs like "The Happiest Girl," which breaks the girl crush concept and showcases the members in a more raw and authentic light. For a rap-heavy group like Blackpink, or any YG group for that matter, having rappers Lisa and Jennie trade in their verses for a lyrical ballad is definitely a novelty in their discography. It paid off, evidently, as Blinks were pleasantly surprised to see Lisa's beautiful singing voice go viral.
Unfortunately, not everyone was satisfied with eight solid tracks — they wanted more. After two years of waiting, Blinks were intrigued to hear the members get in on the production of the album, and excited by the prospect of samples the album promised. They were unimpressed, however, to find out that all of that musical genius was being compressed into such a short album. Unlike “The Album,” “Born Pink” brought no features and had a very short promotion period, lasting only long enough to deliver one Jimmy Kimmel performance, one Inkigayo stage, one SiriusXM show, and five Tik Tok clips. The brevity of it all left many Blinks wanting for more — like a B-side performance or variety show appearances. Perhaps in anticipation of the lashback, label YG released a statement shortly after the promotions ended, reassuring the fans that the girls would embark on the biggest world tour in the history of girl bands in the coming months.
An album full of firsts, “Born Pink” proved that Blackpink is constantly experimenting and getting out of their comfort zone. The pros, however, definitely outweigh the cons of such a risky step in their unfaltering careers.

On Sept. 21 at The Sinclair — fittingly across the street from Lizzy’s Ice Cream — Lizzy McAlpine welcomed her Boston crowd to what was to be an unforgettable show, featuring selections from her sophomore record “five seconds flat.” With earlier indie-folk projects like her debut “Give Me a Minute” and 2021’s “When the World Stopped Moving,” it’s no surprise McAlpine found her niche in the height of the pandemic, embarking on her first headlining tour this fall with support from Carol Ades. The Philadelphia native left Berklee College of Music in 2021 to pursue a music career and, though her growing stardom makes it clear she made the right choice, McAlpine made sure to underscore how much Boston means to her.
“Most of these songs are about Boston,” she said ahead of a performance of a song from “five seconds flat” called “all my ghosts.” “This place is really special to me. I love Boston so much.”
During her set, McAlpine carried herself with effortless humor and ease, a remarkable feat given this is her first-ever headlining tour. Armed with a microphone, guitar, and the occasional backing track, her vulnerability was met with a reverent hush. There was hardly a dry eye after her powerful rendition of “ceilings,” one of the singles off of “five seconds flat.” Based on how rapidly
McAlpine’s star is rising and how quickly her tickets sold out, a small venue like The Sinclair might seem like the lesser choice for someone who would easily sell out a larger venue. However, the intimacy of The Sinclair matched the intimate nature of the setlist and guaranteed the crowd would be made up of listeners who cared about and connected deeply with McAlpine’s writing.
For newer listeners, however, the setlist perfectly showcased McAlpine’s skillful storytelling evolutions as an artist. Selections from “five seconds flat” are more mature, edgier — the cynical and sometimes nihilistic bite that permeates “firearm” and “doomsday,” two newer records, stand in stark contrast to the acoustic innocence and warmth that characterize earlier songs like “Apple Pie” and “Pancakes for Dinner.” In between crowd favorites like “Angelina” and “erase me,” a collaboration with Jacob Collier, McAlpine also introduced her audience to newer songs like “Emma” and “come down soon.” In a more romantically charged setlist, “Emma” was a refreshing change that spoke of sisterly love. “It’ll be us until the end,” she crooned over the riffs of her guitar.
The night also happened to be McAlpine’s 23rd birthday, a fact few forgot as many cries of “Happy birthday!” rang out during her set. In the interim between the two of her songs, the audience managed to squeeze the “Happy Birthday” song in as the intro to “doomsday” began, despite the singer’s protests. “This is the worst time you could’ve done this,” she said laughingly, before thanking everyone.
At multiple points throughout the night, especially as the show drew to a close, McAlpine took the time to thank her friends, family, and the crowd. “Thank you for holding space for me and my art! Be safe, I love you!” Lizzy told the crowd, before cheerily closing out the night with a performance of “orange show speedway.” While the authenticity of her storytelling and the impeccable clarity of her voice certainly draw audiences in, McAlpine’s humility and obvious delight in what she does are what keep audiences with her.

It is a new decade for The 1975. On the band’s new single “All I Need to Hear” off of their upcoming album “Being Funny in a Foreign Language,” The 1975 step out of their comfort zone of dense lyrics and murky morality to assert the redemptive power of naïve affection. For a band whose discography on love is most expressive in situations of romantic near-misses, “All I Need to Hear” is refreshingly optimistic while still maintaining The 1975’s signature hint of self-deprecating irony.
On the single, frontman Matty Healy croons about his desire to be loved in a voice dripping with reverb. He rejects the world around him — friends he “do[esn’t] want to meet” and the “crowds and cheers” of touring — in favor of his one plea: “tell me you love me, ‘cause that’s all that I need to hear.” The hardest part about writing the record, Healy confesses in the music video introduction, was that he “had to be willing to say, like, cringe shit.” But for a band whose version of a breakup song contains dense lyrics like “at your best, you're intermediately versed in your own feelings,” the simplicity and cliché of Healy’s request renders it all the more earnest.
As The 1975 die-hards are quick to mention, frontman Matty Healy debuted “All I Need to Hear” in a slightly monotonous opening performance for a Phoebe Bridgers concert in October 2021. Perhaps the song was too new, or perhaps Bridgers’s audience was thrown off by a song that didn’t make them want to cry, but the audience reacted tepidly to the song, save for a few cries of “We love you Matty” after the chorus.
The single version, released last Wednesday, showcased why The 1975 is a band, not a Matty Healy solo project. In the music video, which sees the band return to the studio where they recorded the album, Healy mentions that the band recorded the song live. Indeed, the band’s chemistry shines on the recording; guest pianist Jamie Squire and guitarist Adam Hann cultivate a unified and open groove above drummer George Daniel’s ultra-simplistic 6/8 drumbeat. Even Healy’s instruction to Daniel to “do the hi-hats” before the second verse made it to the final recording, reminding listeners that The 1975 does in fact have four members despite Healy’s almost overpowering swagger.
The rest of the music video exemplifies what makes “All I Need to Hear” unique for The 1975. The video opens with three minutes of Healy, alone outside of Real World Studios in rural England, opening on the creative process and the band’s history. He then abruptly reveals the camera crews around him, invoking the artifice of solitude to question the veracity of any modern creative endeavor — a move typical of the dichotomy between self-critical and self-indulgent that defines much of The 1975’s discography. With “All I Need to Hear,” The 1975 rejects this paradigm altogether, taking refuge in the “cringe shit” of love. No chord is unexpected, no melody surprising; the entire composition is escapist simplicity in its purest form.
After the bridge, the third verse kicks off with some well-pitched guitar feedback and expansive piano chords, signaling a slight tonal and lyrical turn from the pure toward the band’s tongue-in-cheek pessimism. Healy’s pining grows increasingly desperate with the lines “reply to my message / pick up my calls,” before he fully breaks down: “I don’t care if you’re insincere / just tell me what I want to hear.” It’s easy to miss between Healy’s mellifluous tone and the euphonic 2-5-1s that support him, but this lyric reveals that all of the loving cheesiness of the song’s first act is yet unattained, and the accompanying musical euphoria is merely aspirational.
Healy opens his music video monologue by monologuing “What is it, three chords and the truth or whatever they say? Well there’s way more than three chords, but at least I was telling the truth.” On “All I Need to Hear,” the affection is sincere, and so is the desperation. It is both musically true to the classic aesthetic of The 1975’s recent style as well as lyrically honest — the lyrics yearn for meaningful connections for artists surrounded by a superficial world of “crowds and cheers.” If the seven unreleased songs on “Being Funny in a Foreign Language” are as timeless and subtle as this single, The 1975 may just have composed their most thoughtful and listenable album yet.

On the remix of “Tomorrow 2,” Memphis rapper Glorilla enlists NYC Rapper Cardi B to effectively combine the hard braggadocious style of Southern Rap with the Bronx East Coast Drill style. In its first week, the song has already hit number one on the Apple Music charts, adding another gem to Cardi B’s ever-growing list of number ones. A music video also accompanied the newly released song, which Glorilla and Cardi B filmed in various parts of New York. The original song, “Tomorrow,” was first released this summer on The CMG Label album “Gangsta Art.” Glorilla recently signed to Yo Gotti’s Memphis record label Collective Music Group in July of this year, in the aftermath of her hit single “FNF” produced with Hitkidd.
The Memphis rap scene, often ignored and undervalued in most hip hop and rap discussions, is one with deep historical roots and is hugely influential to the national and global rap scene. With Glorilla’s stardom and popularity rising with every song she drops, she is currently situating herself within this tradition of Memphis Gangsta rap pioneered by artists such as the late Young Dolph and younger rappers like NLE Choppa, Duke Deuce, Key Glock, and Pooh Shiesty.
The song starts with the producer tag, “Cheese his name is Cheese,” the tag for Macaroni Toni, as the listener is brought into the world of Memphis Gangsta Rap with a hard 808 beat and a simple piano melody extremely conducive to head-bopping. On the track, Glorilla calls out all her haters with the statement, “They say they don’t f*ck with me, but I say they can’t f*ck with me. Just like the air, I’m everywhere, how you say it’s up with me?”
When the first verse comes, Glorilla floats on the beat as she brags about looking good, finally making it, leaving her ex, cutting off her friends, and being too expensive to keep. If “FNF” was about leaving her man and being outside for the summer, then “Tomorrow 2” brings that same braggadocious flair as she raps, “When I lose a n*gga, I just pop out and go find some morе. Soon as I feel like my time get wastеd, then it’s time to go.” Glorilla’s focus is on tomorrow as the chorus’s theme is one of tomorrow always promising a better day.
That better day for Glorilla has come. She has made it, as she sits on the heels of signing a contract with a major record label that included a $500k signing bonus, and with more money and fame comes more haters, which Glorilla addresses by saying that “Them b*tches should’ve stayed down, they could’ve been up with me. But all they doin’ is talkin’ down, ’cause they can’t get up with me.” And what better way of demonstrating that one has made in the rap game than having a Cardi B feature.
Cardi comes in flexing hard with the statement that she “looks good as f*ck” and that although she’s rich, she’s still “hood as f*ck,” mirroring the sentiments that Glorilla articulates in her first verse. Then Cardi starts talking about her haters — she states that although they talk about her, they still listen to her songs, and she still has court cases pending, and that the haters might want to keep their mouths shut.
Cardi then switches up her flow and cadence on the second half of her verse, taking listeners from a hard head bop rhythm to a shorter, choppier flow. Here Cardi throws out disses to an unknown “she,” who one could speculate is Nicki Minaj, as they have had music and Twitter beef as recently as last week. But when the beat and the flow sound so good, one can’t help but sing along as Cardi raps. She even gives a nod to the viral song “Munch” by fellow up-and-coming female rapper Ice Spice, with the line, “That n*gga a munch and he gone eat me like a Mango.” Cardi doesn’t disappoint with her verse as she gives Glorilla a huge co-sign, and the song ends with the chorus one more time with Glorilla giving us hope for a brighter day, rapping, “Every day the sun won’t shine, but that’s why I love tomorrow.”
One can consider “Tomorrow 2” the modern-day “Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow” track from the musical “Annie” with its catchy lyrics, contagious beat, and playful music video. If “Tomorrow 2” is emblematic of the type of music that Glorilla will make in the future, then she is definitely here to stay.

Looking for Columbus Day Plans? See ‘Do the Right Thing’ at the Brattle.
On Oct. 10, the Brattle Theater will play two showings of “Do the Right Thing,” at 1:00 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. If you’ve seen the film, there’s a good chance you’ll want to check it out again. If you haven’t, now’s your chance: Take it.
Most Harvard students I’ve spoken to haven’t seen the 1989 Spike Lee joint. I’m not sure why this is, given that Lee is one of the most acclaimed directors working today — no, of all time — and that the film’s themes resonate a good deal with the 2022 college-campus zeitgeist, as focused as that zeitgeist is on looking racism and racial tension straight in the face. Maybe on New Year’s Day 2020 or 2010, movies from the 1980s became consigned to the dustbin of the Old, and “Do the Right Thing” started to emit a pheromonal miasma of tedium and stuffiness. Maybe, unbeknownst to me, something about the picture was found at some point to be problematic, and it was sentenced to fade quietly into popular obscurity. And of course, there are always the old saws: Maybe Harvard students just don’t have the time.
Whatever the cause of the movie’s unwatchedness among Harvard students, the present state of affairs does a disservice not so much to the film, which will be just fine, thank you very much, as to the students themselves. “Do the Right Thing” is one of the most energetic, and energizing, movies I have ever seen (I’ll leave more objective superlative claims to critics who have seen more movies, of whom there is no shortage). It is a hip-hop picture not only on its surface, its Brechtian opening credits featuring Rosie Perez dancing furiously to Public Enemy’s “Fight the Power” (a song written for the movie) on a Bed-Stuy–backdropped stage, but also to its core. It paints the Bedford-Stuyvesant block on which it is set in colors so bright and observes its denizens from angles so Dutch as to be bombastic, so that the picture embodies cinematically the aesthetic spirit that Chuck D and Flavor Flav embody musically.
“Do the Right Thing,” however, is not an exact filmic analogue of “It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back.” Public Enemy is trying to start a revolution; if “Do the Right Thing” believes fiercely that a change must come, it is also profoundly ambivalent about how it should — or if, indeed, it can. The movie climaxes in conflagration, and as the radio host Mister Señor Love Daddy (Samuel L. Jackson) surveys the ashes of the dénouement, he asks: “Are we going to live together?” It’s a question to which “No” is a real answer.
And a devastating answer, in large part because of how lovingly “Do the Right Thing” has spent the previous two hours sketching its dramatis personae. For a picture that feels as powerfully forward-moving as it does, “Do the Right Thing” has astonishingly little in the way of plot. Its entire story can be more or less summed up thus: on a scorching summer day, the residents of a Bed-Stuy block and the merchants who work on that block confront racism, both personal and structural, as they try to make a living and stand the heat.
The story can be that simple because the film spends most of its runtime developing a cast of characters played by the finest ensemble of any picture I can name. The movie features half a dozen performances that, in almost any other picture, would be head-over-shoulders standouts, including those of neighborhood elder statesmen Da Mayor (Ossie Davis) and Mother Sister (Ruby Dee); budding representational politics activist Buggin’ Out (Giancarlo Esposito); “Fight the Power” blaster Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn); the almost omnisciently narratorial Mister Señor Love Daddy; the Greek chorus–like trio of ML (Paul Benjamin), Coconut Sid (Frankie Faison), and Sweet Dick Willie (Robin Harris); and protagonist Mookie (Lee himself), through whose eyes we see most — but not all — of the block’s dynamics unfold.
And then there is Pino Fragione (John Turturro), the film’s one overt and aggressive racist (in one particularly charming instance, he likens Bed-Stuy to “Planet of the Apes”). James Baldwin once criticized “The Defiant Ones”’s portrayal of “a kind of pathetic, unthinking racist” for flattening racism into a peculiar and somehow less-than-human vice. Baldwin, one imagines, would have liked “Do the Right Thing;” or at least he would not have lodged that particular complaint against it. Even Pino gets Lee’s boundless love, and though we do not like him by the movie’s end, we cannot despise him as we do an insect or a cartoon Nazi; he is too human for that.
Indeed, it is one of the film’s most impressive feats that, even as it immortalizes itself with every shot and every line of dialogue, it remains an unflaggingly human piece of art. Its characters are both personages and persons. This is one of several syntheses Lee pulls off with aplomb. Another lies in Love Daddy’s “Are we going to live together?” line, which embodies the film’s accomplishment not of skating between protest-filled outrage and elegiac sadness but of effecting both at once; and still another lies in the fact that the film is all at once a political meditation, a character study, and a propulsively told story.
In none of this is “Do the Right Thing” show-offish. It is political without being crudely moralistic and visually beautiful without being ostentatious. It is of the kind of verve that is confident enough not to need validation from its viewer, and its thoughtfulness is always partner rather than impediment to the effusiveness of its filmmaking (contemporary viewers might bear in mind Paul Beatty’s half–tongue-in-cheek theory of “unmitigated Blackness” as “simply not giving a fuck” and realizing “that there are no absolutes, except when there are”).
Which is to say that “Do the Right Thing,” in addition to being my pick for the Great American Film, is also just (“just!”) a really good movie; life and Harvard Square are unlikely to offer a better use of $12 and two hours of a three-day-weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

In my senior year of high school, I took a class that involved writing a long-term creative project. I knew immediately what I wanted to do: an anti-Shakespeare story.
At that point, I was in my sixth year of studying Shakespeare. We started with Much Ado About Nothing in Year 7 and finished with The Tempest in Year 12. And by the end, I was thoroughly sick of it all: of writing “Elizabethan” and “Jacobean” in my essays; of constantly glancing between the original text and the translation in my “No Fear Shakespeare” copy; of pretending I liked, or even cared about, half the plays I was analyzing.
So I wrote my anti-Shakespeare story. If you’re thinking that it sounds immature and angsty, you’d be right. I ended up getting one of the lowest grades in the state, and it very nearly tanked my Australian version of the GPA. (Thank god I had a backup class).
As much as it was a failure, I still think about that project from time to time, because the essence of what I was reaching for remains valid. I wasn’t being anti-Shakespeare, per se, but anti-literary canon. I was expressing a common frustration about the assumed status of the Western literary canon as the zenith of all literature.
Plenty of people before me have beat the drum for expanding the canon. They have pointed out its serious diversity problem, and the fact that it has historically been determined by a premier group of critics and academics. I won’t replicate those arguments here. But while the “to expand or not to expand” debates rage on, I pose another, perhaps simpler question: Why should we have a canon at all?
You might be thinking: Sure, the current canon has a diversity problem, but anyone who wants to be worldly and educated should be reading the best texts out there, right?
Here’s my problem. Where is the actual proof that the Western canon is, genuinely, made up of the best works out there? A common argument is that Shakespeare, Dante, and Milton have survived the “test of time” — they must be good, because hundreds of years after their lives, we’re still reading them. And sure, enduring appeal is certainly one aspect that could explain their longevity. But so is inertia. And gatekeeping, and gaslighting, at an elite academic level.
This article wouldn’t be the place to give historical accounts of how different writers have been canonized over time, but I’ll give a hypothetical rundown. A writer (usually white, usually male) finds commercial success in, say, the early twentieth century. Their works have such popular appeal in the public’s recent memory that, even after their death, critics (again, mostly white and male) are still interested in their corpus, and it also gets introduced to some key academic institutions full of impressionable (and white, and male) students.
Largely, these students absorb, as truth, that this particular writer is worthy or special above others in some way. And when some of them grow to become critics, academics, and educators themselves, they replicate what they know.
And so on and so forth, for literal decades. Never mind that some of these highly-regarded writers are now irrelevant, or overshadowed by more contemporary authors. Or that, by the mere fact that they continually offer whole classes on individual canonical writers, educational institutions have provided clear evidence that the canon is largely inaccessible to readers without a fancy degree.
Even nowadays, the mindset of incoming students is crumpled by the broader, “elite” educational system. New students convince themselves that Tolstoy, Dickens, or Joyce must have been the greatest writers to have ever lived, because why else would entire classes be dedicated to them? They learn to suppress their own instincts and potential discomfort with the canon, because if they don’t, they’re often faced with the implication that they’re just not as dazzlingly intelligent as everyone else. And with their already-inflated imposter syndrome, this problem will be the most severe for minority groups — the very people most likely to bring in fresh perspectives.
Canonization thus breeds a culture where it becomes increasingly harder for young and diverse people to give their true reflections on the art and literature around them. It’s almost a game of academic chicken, where the cost of yielding is potentially looking stupider than your peers.
But even if we discount everything above and blindly accept that every work in the canon deserves its place, it still wouldn’t resolve the fundamental problem: art is infinite. And good art — even the “best” art — is something that will always surpass, defy, and be irrelevant to the very idea of a “canon.”
Art gets made every. Single. Day. And although some critics and academics may be horrified to hear this, good art — whatever that may be — can, in reality, be found anywhere and from anyone. (You can read my latest piece to see what I mean about that). All of this means that erecting a canon of the so-called “greatest” art flies in the face of everything art should really be.
In other words, we can “expand” the canon all we want. But we won’t be taking the right path until it expands so much that it ceases to be a “canon” at all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Almost two decades after dropping out of Harvard to found Facebook, Meta CEO Mark E. Zuckerberg returned with Priscilla Chan ’07, bearing half-a-billion dollars and a new Harvard institute to match. The Kempner Institute will study natural and artificial intelligence, operating at the confluence of two fields that have often been studied in isolation.
This institute is an extraordinary development for Harvard and the world. For Harvard, which has sometimes lagged behind more traditional leaders in AI, this is an opportunity to leap forward in an important area of research. Harvard is uniquely well-suited to study the intersection of natural and artificial intelligence, and this work has the potential to significantly improve the cutting edge of AI.
The world, meanwhile, will benefit from the institute’s fundamental research. Insights into the brain could one day be leveraged for clinical application. Insights into machine learning theory — the type that is often too abstract to inspire enough attention in industry — will one day improve the interpretability and performance of one of the most powerful tools we have for shaping the world around us. Finally, giving Harvard’s talented technical students more opportunities to develop expertise in machine learning has the potential to redound huge social benefits.
We acknowledge concerns that the institute seems broadly unconcerned with exploring pressing and complex issues in the field of AI ethics. Machine learning techniques, for example, have at times exhibited racist and sexist tendencies. More generally, the prospect of Artificial General Intelligence whose values do not align with that of humans may represent an existential risk.
While the Kempner Institute’s work of broadly increasing understanding may obliquely improve our ability to regulate AI, it’s true that these ethical issues deserve to be tackled directly. Harvard should fund an AI ethics institute that can centralize and add to existing efforts across the University ranging from Professor Cynthia Dwork’s research on information privacy to the Safra Center for Ethics (funded by another billionaire!) and our Embedded EthiCS program.
But these concerns don’t warrant icing the Kempner Institute. In no other field would we wish to require that every new initiative include space for researching ethics. Instead, we tend to require them to adhere to ethical principles promulgated elsewhere. This is the approach we should take in AI as well.
In fact, there may be a silver lining in Zuckerberg and Chan’s neglect of AI ethics research. These donors have demonstrated great expertise in and passion for the task of advancing technical understanding — which is, appropriately, a focus of this institute. Are they as adept at using this technological progress ethically? Perhaps not. Are they really the donors we want funding Harvard’s exploration of fundamental questions of right and wrong in the use of AI?
We acknowledge, too, the obvious objections to a broader University funding model that implicitly gives billionaire donors influence over which questions get resources and, to some degree, how they are studied. We wish the University could do just as much good without taking Zuckerberg’s money and the risk of undue influence it entails — without letting the fox into the henhouse.
But if Zuckerberg wants to devote resources to the study of these questions, he will. We are concerned about the potential for unethical approaches to this research. Would we rather it take place in the confines of private industry or in the relative (if still often limited) transparency of academia? Conducted by direct reports to a donor we may distrust or by professors at Harvard, accustomed as they are to decentralized autonomy and academic freedom?
This logic is not absolute. The mantra of harm-mitigation would not justify an institute committed to research we find unethical on its face. But the Kempner institute will do necessary research with extraordinary potential for good. If it has potential for abuse, that is an argument for Harvard to step up to the task. We don’t require absolute faith in Harvard’s upstanding character (far from it): only a hard-headed examination of the available alternatives.
Of course, this puts a great burden on our researchers to hold themselves to the highest ethical standards in an area where doing so requires particularly critical thinking and unusual restraint.
It can be easy to lose, amid the righteous imperative to do things correctly, the righteous imperative to do — to strive, to seek, to find. These researchers stand on one of the great frontiers of human knowledge in the 21st century. We can’t wait to see what they learn.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Meet the Kempner Institute for the Study of Natural and Artificial Intelligence: Harvard's newest, flashiest academic initiative, the brainchild of a $500 million donation by Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan ’07,  any AI researcher’s wildest dream — and, in our view, a damning misstep by our institution.
Given our Board’s broad support for both the Kempner Institute and the donation that created it, we, the Editorial Chairs, find ourselves in the unusual position of having to dissent.
Let us preface this dissent by acknowledging the immense potential social benefits of artificial intelligence technology, lest our position be reduced to that of Luddites or fearmongers. We are not blind to the writing on the wall. Few other fields are likely to have as substantial an impact on our lives or to shape our realities quite as much as AI in the coming years. There’s plenty of reason to believe its role will frequently be positive in character, facilitating improved cancer screening techniques, helping us better predict and prepare for natural disasters, and massively boosting productivity. Our robotic overlords — autonomous driving algorithms? weird art creators? — might just prove helpful.
Why, then, oppose an institute that is likely to help spur research into a field we recognize as pressingly important? Why taunt Roko’s Basilisk in such a foolishly public way?
Our opposition to the Kempner Institute isn’t exclusively, or even primarily, concerned with its subject of study. In fact, our first objection to Harvard’s new AI lab is much more mundane and boring than the ultra-futuristic worlds of fancy conjured up by AI enthusiasts. It’s the economy, stupid — the economics of University funding, that is.
Our institution — our entire elite higher education system, arguably — has a penchant for auctioning off academic priorities to the highest bidder. We detest that a single individual, if sufficiently endowed with capital, can hold such sway on our University’s research path. Zuckerberg and Chan are hardly alone. Penny S. Pritzker ’81 wakes up feeling particularly generous and the Economics department gets a $100 million boom and a new departmental facility; a private equity couple is seemingly so bummed by rising sea levels that the $200 million Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability materializes out of thin air. The philanthropist’s whim is the academic’s mandate.
The problematic dynamic threading through these donations isn’t that research is getting funded (we genuinely appreciate that) or even that we have to put up with the wealthy’s pseudo-modest naming tendencies (Zuckerberg chose the parental route, following the path of the Chan brothers). Rather, it’s the fact that a variety of colossally influential funding decisions are almost entirely contingent on the whims of the few, regardless of the needs of the many.
Other academic departments — or “clusters”, if you wish — could use Pritzker’s donation much more than Harvard’s most popular, prominent field. Some research areas, like climate change resiliency, have been underfunded for decades, and remain underfunded if they fail to pique donors’ interest. If our academic loyalties lie with Veritas, our allocation of resources  — the sort of decisions that shape whether students get a new facility or faculty members in less glamorous departments have a path to tenure — is frequently more tethered to our funders’ pet projects.
The University, we are sure, would loudly protest. Administrators since President Derek C. Bok have argued that we must accommodate donors’ desires so as to entice donations and increase inherently valuable research. “Social good” stemming from academia has been the University’s favorite apology for the blatant link between donor preferences and crimson-tinted capital flows. Yet we struggle to believe that any attempt to maximize educational utility at the broad social level would start by funneling an extra hundred million to the world’s wealthiest University. If anything, the system broadens the gap between our institution and those — community colleges, public universities, HBCUs — less likely to attract as many charitable wealth hoarders. While we understand the reticence to turn down any multi-million dollar contributions, we find other funding systems — including ones with stricter no-earmarking policies for colossal gifts, as well as those that extract and redistribute involuntary donations from ten-figure figures — infinitely more palatable.
This donor-centric model of financing, fostered by Bok and his successors, will almost certainly come with consequences in the case of Zuckerberg’s AI endeavor.
The development of technology based on research conducted at Kempner is likely to benefit Zuckerberg, who has described AI as the “key to unlocking the Metaverse” and invested continuously in AI systems over the past 10 years, tremendously. And given Harvard’s history of allocating a great deal of pedagogical influence to its donors — take, for example, the Visiting Fellow title, private campus office, and direct connection to faculty in the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics that were provided to the billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein — it seems probable that research conducted at Kempner will align with, if not directly contribute to, Meta’s corporate goals.
One doesn't need a PhD in tech ethics (luckily, given the low odds that some millionaire would help fund it) to understand why this latter realization should be a cause for concern; one needs just to have been alive and awake for the past decade. Despite Meta’s stated mission of “Giv[ing] people the power to build community and bring the world closer together,” the lasting legacy of Zuckerberg’s brainchild on the 21st century will at least partly be the destruction of American democracy — a near-literal transcription of a comment made by the former chief technology officer of the U.S. — through rampant, unchecked, and algorithmically-promoted misinformation which inflamed partisan divides in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election and fostered an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol in January 2021, all while lining Zuckerberg’s pockets.
Beyond landing potentially fatal blows to a centuries-old institution, the profit model and corporate callousness embedded within the tech giant’s operations — captured in Zuckerberg’s now-infamous motto of “move fast and break things” — have also proven the potential to be literally deadly. Perhaps the most salient example of this is the platform’s well-documented role in the 2016-2017 genocide of the Rohingya ethnic minority in Myanmar, for which Meta (which, conveniently enough, changed its name from Facebook in 2021 as it faced renewed backlash for spreading misinformation and hate speech during the crisis) was subpoenaed in the ongoing genocide case against Myanmar at the International Court of Justice, in addition to finding itself the subject of a class-action lawsuit brought forth by a group of Rohingya refugees. Worse still, a cache of internal documents revealed last year by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen suggests that Facebook leaders knew of the disastrous effects of their creation all along — and did basically nothing.
To put it simply: We have reason to be skeptical of Zuckerberg as a good steward of ethical AI research, and of the funding system that empowers him to pose as one under the legitimizing Harvard brand. It’s further concerning that out of the $500 million donated to launch Kempner, not a single penny seems to have been donated to AI ethics research, a field that is both heavily underfunded and unlikely to find champions in the non-academic realm of profit-maximizing tech corporations.
The overall outcome — million-dollar funding that mirrors the donor’s interests, little ethical scrutiny on a hotspot of research for a field infamously ridden by ethical dilemmas, and an enthusiastic response from a student community that really should know the pertinent players better by now — is hardly something to celebrate. A fulfillment of a dystopic “Zuckerbergitas,” maybe, at the expense of Harvard’s loftiest ideals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Harvard College Overdose Prevention and Education Students, a campus group dedicated to overdose awareness, urged the University to remove Arthur M. Sackler’s name from campus buildings in a proposal submitted Monday.
The 23-page proposal calls on Harvard to dename the Arthur M. Sackler Museum, part of the Harvard Art Museums, and the Arthur M. Sackler Building, a Faculty of Arts and Sciences building. The Sackler family’s company, Purdue Pharma, pled guilty in 2020 to charges around their marketing of the addictive painkiller OxyContin. Members of the family reached a $6 billion settlement agreement in March that would resolve thousands of civil lawsuits over their role in the opioid epidemic.
In the proposal, the authors acknowledge Arthur Sackler passed away almost a decade before OxyContin hit the market, but they argue the marketing practices he created fueled sales of the drug.
The proposal was submitted through the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Process for Denaming Spaces, Programs, or other Entities, which had a Monday deadline for requests for the 2022-2023 academic year.
Last week, more than 300 Harvard affiliates signed a petition included in the proposal to express their support for removing the Sackler name from Harvard. Organizers promised to enter any person who signed the petition into a lottery for $100.
If the proposal is approved, Harvard would follow in the footsteps of other prominent organizations, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the British Museum, which removed the Sackler family name from their buildings.
The denaming proposal contends the Sackler name is “deeply tied to the opioid epidemic.”
“To many of us—students, staff, and faculty—it is unacceptable and deeply offensive that we are represented by the Sackler name,” the proposal reads. “It is embarrassing and unsettling to know that our school, unlike almost every other cultural and educational institution that at one point displayed the Sackler name, has decided to keep the name, despite the message of disrespect that it sends to our community and to the world.”
A Harvard spokesperson confirmed FAS had received the proposal and said it would move forward in the review process. A Harvard Art Museums spokesperson wrote that the request to dename the Harvard Art Museum building would move through a similar review process under the University, as the museum is not part of FAS.
The museum spokesperson added that Harvard currently does not have plans to remove Arthur Sackler’s name from the building, noting he died prior to the development of OxyContin and that his foundation does not fund the museum.
Still, the proposal authors alleged Arthur Sackler was “far from blameless” in the opioid epidemic due to his role in developing medical marketing techniques they described as “deeply unethical.”
“Put simply, the ethos of the Sackler family and of Purdue Pharma can be traced back directly to Arthur Sackler,” the proposal reads.
Spokespeople for Purdue Pharma and Jillian Sackler — Arthur Sackler’s widow — did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
Activists have previously called for the removal of the Sackler name from campus buildings. Following protests in 2019, however, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said it would be “inappropriate” to remove the name.
Jay P. Garg ’24, the policy chair for HCOPES, said he hopes going through the now-formalized FAS process for removing controversial names will be a more effective way to push for change than past protests.
“There’s a committee of people who are going to look at it and try to grapple with how central this is to University life and how central this is to the history of this country, and what should be done as a result of it,” Garg said. “I’m hoping that the process itself will make it a little easier to get something done.”
Allan M. Brandt, a History of Science professor and HCOPES faculty adviser, expressed his support for the proposal in an emailed statement and said the Sackler name on campus buildings poses an “important reputational risk” to Harvard.
“I urge the University to act positively on this important and thoughtfully presented request to dename the buildings currently named for members of the Sackler family,” he wrote.
David M. Hogg ’23, whose tweet last month calling on Harvard to remove Sackler’s name garnered more than 10,000 likes and a thousand retweets, said he believes the presence of the Sackler family’s name on campus buildings is “terrible.”
Hogg added that Harvard’s mission, which he described as “creating better citizens and citizen-leaders,” does not align with “celebrating” the Sackler family.
“Citizen leaders help address the injustices that come before us and acknowledge that we may not necessarily be responsible for creating them ourselves,” Hogg said. “But we do have a responsibility to address them and find some form of justice. I think a first step in the right direction is changing the name — but it’s not the last step.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time in 80 years, the City of Cambridge is launching a comprehensive review of its government structure.
A group of 15 Cantabrigians selected by the city will make recommendations to the City Council over the next year on how to “improve and modernize” the city’s charter, according to a press release from the mayor’s office.
Any suggestions approved by the City Council from the committee will then be voted upon by Cambridge residents before implementation.
Ellen Shachter, a Cambridge resident and Somerville city official, said in an interview she joined the committee to examine the charter “through the lens of government efficiency and democratic decision-making.”
“I really want to provide input that has some balance between making sure that we have really strong grassroots democratic processes in the City of Cambridge, but also that the government is able to function effectively and efficiently,” she said.
Another committee member, Jessica De Jesus Acevedo, who owns a daycare business, said she hopes to amplify perspectives she feels are underrepresented in city government, such as young adults, women of color, and business owners of color.
“I really want to be an advocate for residents that aren’t necessarily being accounted for,” Acevedo said in an interview.
Cambridge operates under a Plan E charter, which features an elected City Council and an appointed city manager. While the mayor, who is elected by fellow City Councilors, serves a role akin to chair of the Council, the city manager handles the day-to-day operation of the city, its departments, and its budget.
The council-manager form of government has been criticized by some councilors and residents for the concentrated influence of the city manager over city operations.
But some committee members said it was too early to say whether a wholesale restructuring of the government might be on the table.
Shachter acknowledged that a major question for the review committee is whether to alter the role of the city manager, but said the issue might not be addressed in the next year.
“I’m not sure whether we’re going to be addressing in this next year those really big questions or not,” she said.
James G. Stockard Jr., a committee member and lecturer at the Graduate School of Design, said he felt Cambridge has historically been “quite well-governed.”
Both Stockard and Shachter said they were waiting to confer with the rest of the committee before taking a firm position on major changes to the charter.
The review committee formed as a result of a November 2021 ballot question, which called for a review of the charter every 10 years. The proposal passed with nearly 70 percent of voters in favor.
Acevedo said she hopes Cambridge residents will be “a part of the conversation and a part of the changes that are going to happen,” and called on any resident with input or suggestions to reach out to the committee.
The first charter of the City of Cambridge was adopted in 1846, featuring a City Council made up of two bodies: the board of aldermen, which was elected by all the city’s voters, and the common council, which was elected by district. The mayor, also elected at-large, would handle “the administration of all the fiscal, prudential and municipal affairs” of the city.
In 1915, Cambridge switched to a Plan B government — a structure that included fifteen councilors, some elected at-large and others elected by district. The mayor was elected from among the councilors.
The introduction of a city manager to the Cambridge political system came in 1940, with the adoption of the Plan E charter. The Plan E charter — which has remained largely unchanged since its adoption — also called for of up to nine city councilors, elected at-large.
The review of the charter that began in August follows the selection of a new Cambridge city manager, Yi-An Huang ’05, who took office last month. Shachter said the start of Huang’s tenure will serve as a test of the council-manager form of government.
“The pressure is going to be on the new city manager to make sure that he is really promoting an administration that is responsive to grassroots community participation, that is open, that is accessible,” Shachter said, adding Huang must prove he can “run the city efficiently” with the city manager government structure.

The Dean of Students Office allocated $550,000 to the Harvard Undergraduate Association Monday — a 10 percent increase from the usual yearly budget of its predecessor, the Harvard Undergraduate Council.
The HUA had requested $682,000 from the DSO last week, citing inflation and an increased volume of club funding requests.
In a letter obtained by The Crimson, Associate Dean of Students Engagement and HUA adviser Jason R. Meier applauded the group’s presentation and proposal, which advocated for a 14 percent increase in club funding and allocations for big-ticket items, including a $4,000 “QuadFest” and $10,000 for HUA retreats.
“Your thoughtfulness and connection to the mission and vision of the organization were evident,” he wrote. “While it’s not possible to give full funding based on the current resources we have, we are happy to allot a budget increase from previous years and hope that this increase will allow you to move forward on the HUA’s goals and priorities.”
Though they had proposed a much larger sum, the HUA was still able to receive more than its predecessor, which had not been a guarantee. Meier previously cautioned that the HUA could face a budget reduction compared to the UC, citing shrinking participation in the student activities fee, in an interview with The Crimson Thursday.
Four bodies — the HUA, the College Events Board, the Harvard Foundation Student Advisory Committee, and housing committees — are funded by the Student Activities Fee, a $200 charge automatically applied to the tuition bill of each College student.
According to Meier, an increasing number of College students have opted out of the fee in recent years, rendering budget expansions difficult.
In a statement to The Crimson Monday, HUA Co-President Travis Allen Johnson ’24 indicated that an adjusted budget will be presented at the Association’s general meeting on Saturday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Approximately 75 Harvard Law School students walked out of a panel discussion Thursday in protest of its anti-abortion stance.
Harvard Law Students for Life hosted the panel, which discussed the evolving legal status of abortion. The event featured civil procedure professor Stephen E. Sachs ’02 and legal scholar Erika Bachiochi, who both oppose abortion rights.
Sachs analyzed the Supreme Court’s legal reasoning in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case, which ended Constitutional protections for abortion, and offered insight into the future implications of the ruling.
A few minutes after Sachs began speaking, many of the students in attendance stood up and exited the Wasserstein Hall classroom.
“I was baffled!” Sachs wrote in a statement to The Crimson. “I wondered if I had unintentionally said something offensive! But I quickly realized that it must have been pre-planned.”
The effort was organized by HLS second-year students Lisa Fanning and Tala A. Alfoqaha and first-year students Corinne M. Shanahan and Allie R. Ryave.
“We are experiencing this sort of collective rage, and we wanted these people who were smug with glee over the overturning of Roe and the loss of reproductive freedom for so many people to just have to confront that,” Alfoqaha said.
Ryave, who volunteered to stand up first, said she believes the walk-out demonstrated the gravity of the debate over abortion rights.
“It's important that this event showed this is not just a theoretical debate to be had in the classroom,” Ryave said. “These are people's lives.”
Ellie A. Olsen, a second-year student who participated in the walk-out, said those who protested the panel aimed to counter the “really powerful minority of students who have extreme conservative views” at the Law School.
“We as students had a responsibility to push back against that and make it clear that like the majority of Americans, the students at Harvard Law School do not support this radical Supreme Court,” she said. “We don't support right-wing ideology, and we're not going to we're not going to sit silently.”
As the students walked out, Monica E. Monroe, HLS assistant dean for community engagement, equity, and belonging, read a statement on the Law School’s free speech policy. Sachs then continued with his talk.
“I’m not surprised there was disagreement,” Sachs said. “But I’m disappointed it took the form of a walk-out while a speaker was talking.”
“I’d rather the students had stayed, listened, and asked pointed questions — or that they had left before the talk began rather than interrupting, however briefly,” he added.
In a joint statement, the Harvard Law Students for Life board members said they were “not upset” by the protest.
“We wish more pro-abortion students would have stuck around, as we had several such students ask questions during the Q&A section and after the event had ended,” they wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Around 50 Harvard affiliates gathered on the steps of Widener Library on Friday to stand in solidarity with women in Iran, where protests have erupted in recent weeks after Zhina Mahsa Amini died in police custody.
Amini, 22, died on Sept. 16 at a hospital in Tehran after she was arrested by Iran’s “morality police” for allegedly breaking the country’s hijab rules. Her family says she was beaten in police custody and died after suffering blows to the head.
Iranian authorities deny wrongdoing, but the country has erupted in unrest in recent weeks, with many women burning their hijabs in protest of the Iranian government.
“Iranians are asking us, the international community, to be their voice, to amplify them, and to stand with them,” Saba Mehrzad ’25, an organizer of the rally, said during a speech at the event.
The protest was organized by Mehrzad, Tarina K. Ahuja ’24, Alaha A. Nasari ’24, and Dina M. Kobeissi ’24, who all spoke at the rally, alongside other faculty and students.
The crowd on the Widener steps chanted “women, life, freedom” in both English and Persian.
Ahuja said the goal of the rally was “to be in solidarity” with women in Iran and provide them a platform on Harvard’s campus.
“The women in Iran, they are leading a revolution. They don’t need the U.S. or us to save them, they need a platform,” Ahuja said. “They need to be amplified because they’re the ones that are just truly putting their actual lives on the line, so the least that we can do is be there with them and for them.”
The protests in Iran are some of the largest in years.
“I think the power of social media allowed us to really spread [the rally] and to get different people and communities involved in the organizing and in coming today,” Kobeissi said.
In interviews after the event, Nasari and Kobeissa said they organized the rally to protest government restrictions on women, emphasizing the difference between state policies and the religion of Islam.
“I really want people to see that this is not an issue of Islam — this is not the religion that they portray it to be — and I think that is such a common misconception that people in the West are still battling today,” Nasari said.
“A veil does not have any symbolic meaning on its own — it’s when you put it on willingly that it becomes your hijab,” Kobeissi said.
Ahuja said “solidarity is the most important part of” Friday’s demonstration.
“When we show up for each other, we’re unstoppable,” she said.

Harvard-Brown typically falls into the shadow of the highly anticipated Harvard-Yale game, but — as part of the 0.00001 percent of the time when the student body decides to rally around something in the name of school spirit (even though we don’t have a real mascot #sad) — it can still be really fun. And judging from everyone’s Instagram stories from the weekend of the game, I’m not the only one with this opinion. So here’s how the day went:
For all you I-put-lunch-and-hanging-out-in-my-gcal folks, this is the minute-by-minute rundown of my trek to Brown. This year’s Harvard-Brown game was on Saturday, Sept. 24th at 12:30 p.m. in Providence, Rhode Island. My friends and I hopped in an Uber from Eliot House at 9 a.m. to catch the 9:40 a.m. Amtrak. Maybe this was a giant overestimation of travel time, but one, I had to ensure we had a few minutes to stop by the La Colombe Cafe across from South Station because their oat milk draft latte is to DIE for, and two, better early than not on the train.
On the platform, we ran into more friends who were on the same train (surprise surprise), which made the forty minute ride pass much faster than a gened lecture. I’m sure the 238,928 Harvard Shop locations in the Square had major foot traffic the night before, because everyone was head-to-toe in Harvard gear. It was actually really nice to see that everyone was excited for the day (and good at pretending we go to a state school).
Once in Providence, a LOT of walking occurred. It was about a thirty minute walk to the stadium where the tailgate was, but again, it went by quickly with friends.
Ivy League students “tailgating” is always funny, because our tailgates consist of a few students standing awkwardly in the grass, bobbing their heads while holding warm beers. This tailgate was basically a bunch of sweaty people squished in between two U Haul pickup trucks, but I will admit I enjoyed myself, even though I regret my choice of long sleeves.  It was a fraction of the size of last year’s Harvard-Yale tailgate, and tl;dr: Brown students need to work on their speaker system. But it was a picture perfect day weather-wise (cue the Instagram stories).
The game itself was… not very exciting (but also when is it ever,,,). So I stuck around for about twenty minutes, really just to be able to say I went, then ventured to the Shake Shack for a much needed Double Shack Burger. I demolished it.
At this point, the football was basically forgotten. I eventually ended up on the 3:30 p.m. train back to Boston. While spending time in Providence was a refreshing break from the Harvard bubble, I still think we win in terms of best college town :’)
Overall, I’m really glad I went to the game, even if I felt like I spent the following week catching up on work. It was an awesome pregame for this year’s Harvard-Yale game, and I can’t wait for all the awkward tailgating, good times, and additional profit for the Harvard Shop to come.  #rollcrim.
