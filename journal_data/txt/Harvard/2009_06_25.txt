After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Graduate students and junior faculty members may find themselves with fewer opportunities to hone their teaching skills next year, as the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning struggles to adjust to a 40 percent cut in its budget.
The Center, which dispenses teaching advice to faculty and teaching fellows throughout the school year, has already in recent months seen its staff shrink by six employees, or nearly 50 percent of its personnel, according to the Center's director, James D. Wilkinson '65. And while some of those positions may be filled later this summer because the vacancies opened after staffers either accepted a buyout from the University or found jobs elsewhere, Wilkinson said he still expects the Center to lack the manpower to accomplish all of its goals.
"We are doing our best not to cut back, but it will certainly mean we're going to have to be more efficient," he said. "We can't do everything we've done in the past."
News of the steep reduction came Monday, as final budgeting announcements were made across the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Wilkinson said. FAS is currently planning a major internal restructuring to help it cope with what is projected to be a $220 million deficit over the next two years. The University announced on Tuesday that it would be eliminating 275 staff positions over the next few days to help reduce compensation costs.
Among the Bok Center's best-known programs are its teaching conferences for junior faculty members and TFs held in August and September. Michael Frazer, an assistant professor who arrived in the government department in 2007, called the programs "incredibly helpful" and said they allowed participants to become familiar with each other and with teaching at the University.
Wilkinson said that those conferences would take place as scheduled, but that "people will just have to work harder" in light of the reduced staffing. For this upcoming year, organizers expect the conferences to host 475 to 500 TFs and 30 junior faculty members, he said, as well as the newly appointed Harvard College Fellows.
Wilkinson said that the Center would maintain all 20 of its departmental TFs, who are paid to advise their fellow TFs, thereby increasing the impact of the Center's efforts. He also said that the Bok Center may allocate more of its limited resources to enhancing new General Education courses.
"I think our core efforts will continue," Wilkinson said. The Bok Center was founded in 1975 to improve the quality of undergraduate education at Harvard and was renamed in 1991 to honor former University President Derek C. Bok.
But at an institution that is sometimes criticized for emphasizing research over pedagogy, the sizable cuts faced by the Bok Center may be seen as an indication that undergraduate teaching is undervalued.
"It seems kind of short-sighted, [with the Bok Center] being one of the few things Harvard does to support educating teachers," said Matthew D. Schwartz, an assistant professor of physics. "This is only going to exemplify the lack of devotion to teaching resources."
But at the same time, Schwartz acknowledged that administrators must carefully decide how best to utilize Harvard's much-diminished resources and slash costs with minimal impact to the University at large.
"Whenever you make budget cuts you have to make compromises," he noted, "and perhaps [the Bok Center] is something that's more expendable than other staff and resources."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Annenberg Dining Hall card-swiper and campus legend Domna Antoniou accepted the University's buyout package and will retire this Tuesday, she said, after working at Harvard University Dining Services for nearly 22 years. Referred to almost exclusively by her first name on campus, Domna came to America from Macedonia, Greece, and worked at a dental company for 15 years before being hired by Harvard. Since then, she has risen to celebrity status one swipe at a time, checking in freshmen at nearly every meal as they enter Annenberg dining hall. “She's the only character I can think of at Harvard that every single student knows and can get into a conversation about,” said Sami Majadla ’11. Domna has always remained loyal to the University’s first-year students, whom she affectionately refers to as “my freshmen.” In an interview, she said that getting to know Harvard’s new blood—“talking with them and laughing with them and joking with them”—has been her favorite part of the job. She said she has never left Annenberg for a position in an upperclass dining hall during her Harvard career. “I started with freshmen and I finish with freshmen,” she said. While some students are on good terms with Domna, many a freshman without the plastic necessary to eat at Annenberg has seen her more cantankerous side. “It sucks that all the incoming freshmen won't have somebody to yell a lecture at them every time they forget their IDs,” Majadla said. Domna said that she believes students overall view her in a “positive” light, although she admits, “sometimes I yell at them, but that was because I had to.” “I have to straighten them up sometimes, but I love them," she said. Domna’s presence has been pervasive on campus over her many years as Annenberg's steward. A 2002 Class Ode written for Commencement began with the lines: “Fair Harvard we swipe in our old ID cards/For one last encounter with Domna/If your card is forgotten then all will be lost/Not unlike the crashing dot-comna.” Urban Dictionary, a Web site that defines slang words and phrases, has a single listing for Domna: “Female gatekeeper of freshman dining halls. She swipes your cards and steals your hearts. Domna - the dominator.” And in 1998, a Crimson article by Amanda P. Fortini '98 included “try to get into Annenberg for lunch, just to see Domna again,” in a list of 100 things to do before graduating. Anna M. Yeung ’12, a student in Expository Writing 50, "Advanced Writing," chose Domna as the subject of one of her assignments. An excerpt from the paper reads, “She is the material of fables and lore, of pumpkin carvings and ballads, and the subject of Crimson profiles. She has been the Annenberg card swiper and dining service employee since time immemorial. Before God said, ‘Let there be light,’ he said, ‘Let there be Domna.’” Zenab R. Tavakoli ’12 heard about the famous card-swiper for the first time on her Freshmen Outdoor Program trip. One of her leaders, Jeffery S. Overall ’11, noted how important it was to get on “Domna’s good side,” according to Tavakoli. He recommended that each trip participant bring her flowers, and said that he had given her tulips the year before. Reflecting on the experience, Tavakoli added, “Domna is the new Chuck Norris.” Domna said that some of her favorite Harvard memories are of the surprise gifts and gestures of affection she received from students. One birthday, students serenaded her with a guitar, and on another, Domna remembered, “Two of my favorite guys brought me a big birthday cake.” Reflecting on her imminent departure, Domna said, "I’m going to miss Harvard, but it's time for me to go and let somebody else do the job." Annenberg dining hall management and Crista Martin, the HUDS director for marketing and communications, declined to comment on Domna’s retirement, citing the issue as personal and private. —Staff writer Molly M.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dozens of union activists, students, and University employees gathered in Harvard Yard Thursday afternoon to voice their outrage and disbelief at the hundreds of staff layoffs announced earlier this week. Participants remonstrated University administrators for slashing the jobs of long-time employees while failing to issue pay cuts for themselves and top financiers. Speakers reiterated their belief that Harvard's top leaders' actions have been motivated by greed and financial self-interest and argued that the University's behavior has been unbecoming of its non-profit designation. One protester's sign even asked, "Harvard: University? or Investment Bank?" "At this time, anger is a necessary thing," said Wayne M. Langley, director of higher education for the Service Employees International Union Local 615, to a cheering crowd. "People have to stand up, rise up, and defend our rights...this is only the beginning." The rally's attendees included members from various local unions as well as the Student Labor Action Movement, Socialist Alternative, Women's Fightback Network, and even the Allston-Brighton Neighborhood Assembly. On Tuesday morning, Harvard President Drew G. Faust and Vice President for Human Resources Marilyn Hausammann announced in e-mails that the University would be eliminating 275 staff positions in coming days, with administrative and professional jobs comprising half the cuts and clerical and technical jobs comprising the remainder. Approximately 40 other staffers would see their work hours reduced or shifted to a seasonal schedule, but trade workers would be largely unaffected, the e-mails noted. Participants in the rally rejected the anticipated 30 percent decline in the University's endowment for this fiscal year as an adequate and honest justification for the layoffs. A recurring slogan used by protesters in recent months has been "Harvard has the money—no layoffs," and Tom Potter, a faculty secretary at the Law School and a participant in Thursday's rally, said he doesn't think Harvard has "any financial justification [for the layoffs] at all." Similarly, Grace C. Ross '83, the Green-Rainbow Party's candidate for Massachusetts governor in 2006, said at the rally that she believed "there is no question Harvard has enough money" to avoid layoffs. Instead, she said, the University's administrators are all just "crying poor because they're no longer minting money on our backs." But University spokesman Kevin Galvin noted that compensation costs account for half of Harvard's operating budget, and also pointed to the other cost-cutting measures implemented by the University before the layoffs, including a voluntary early retirement program, a salary freeze for faculty and non-union staff, and strictly limited hiring practices. He said that staff reductions have thus far been "spread evenly across our workforce," and noted that the average participant in the early retirement program had an annual salary of $67,000, with roughly half the participants working as hourly employees and half as administrative and professional staff. Nevertheless, "these steps did not generate the savings we needed to achieve" to avoid layoffs, Galvin said. Geoff Carens, a Harvard librarian and a member of the Harvard Union for Clerical and Technical Workers, used a loudspeaker to lead the protestors in chants that included "The people, united, will never be defeated" and "They say cutback, we say fightback; They say lay off, we say back off." Carens told the crowd that Harvard is "fabulously rich" and assailed the University for cutting jobs and failing to "live up to its responsibility in our community" as a tax-exempt, non-profit organization during a tough recession. Phebe Eckfeldt, a HUCTW member and staffer in the admissions office, similarly said at the protest that "a job is a right and Harvard has to give it to us." She also said that she believed "an orgy of speculation on the stock market" triggered the current crisis, and that the announced layoffs were an attempt to "bust" unions at the University. Attendees of Thursday's protest also included at least two faculty members. Afsaneh Najmabadi, a professor of history and women, gender, and sexuality studies, said that layoffs were "not the only or the best option" to reduce costs at the University, and Brad Epps, a professor of romance languages and literatures and WGS, said he was "mad as hell" that workers had been laid off while senior faculty and administrators remain, to his knowledge, untouched. Epps said he and other faculty wrote e-mails to the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Michael D. Smith, asking administrators to implement a "reverse sliding scale pay cut," in which those with higher salaries would take higher-percentage cuts. But Smith replied saying the option had been discussed but rejected, Epps said. He added that if the fiscal crisis had truly necessitated "difficult decisions," referring to Faust's e-mail, the cuts "would have had a direct impact on senior faculty and administration." Instead, the announced layoffs are indicative of "institutional cowardice," Epps said, noting that he believes the budget-cutting process has not been conducted in an "open, transparent, productive way." Attracting the attention of summer school students and visiting tourists throughout the hour-long protest, the crowd of protesters marched and shouted their way first to Mass. Hall and then to the Holyoke Center, where they brandished signs emblazoned with various anti-layoff slogans. Near the end of the rally, Carens led the crowd in chanting, "We'll be back." —Staff writer Peter F. Zhu can be reached at pzhu@fas.harvard.edu.
