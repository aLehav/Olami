After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lynette Roth, curator at the Harvard Art Museums, said that when she decided to open an exhibition showcasing German art from 1943-1955, she knew it would be a sensitive subject for a modern day audience. Most art historians consider the 12 years—spanning from right before the Nazi Regime collapsed to after West Germany’s commercial boom—to be a lost age in German art. Roth certainly proved them wrong. “Inventur - Art in Germany, 1943-55,” opened Feb. 9, featuring more than 160 works by almost 50 artists. The exhibit shows the multifaceted society of postwar Germany.
The opening celebration included a lecture by Konrad Klapheck, a renowned artist featured in the exhibition. The artist struck an emotional chord with the audience in the packed lecture hall—and through the simulcast—about the personal tragedy that affected his art.
“The lecture was very moving,” Philip Higonnet ’83 said. “But there was wonderful positiveness that came out of it, and that, if anything, broadened my perspective on how interesting the subject matter is.”
In his lecture, Klapheck acknowledged that the rise of the regime was a divisive moment for the German art community. “There were some gifted artists who sold their souls to the devil and were blinded by the idea of fame and fortune, but I am glad there were artists alive who refused to be bought,” Klapheck said. Focused on their newly unified regime, Adolf Hitler and Joseph Goebbels, leaders of the Reich, repressed art that rebelled against their message. In November of 1937, the Nazi regime held the Degenerate Art Exhibition, singling out modernist art and artists who threatened the newly established German culture. In the face of hostility, Klapheck said that German artists emigrated, were driven underground, ceased producing artwork, or were co-opted by Nazi propaganda. However, at the end of the war, all of those who stayed were forced to come to terms with the horrors of Germany’s past and redefine Germany’s identity for the future. According to Klapheck, this left the museum’s artwork with a complicated legacy to contend with, featuring work from both those who worked for and those who resisted the Nazi regime.
Several visitors to the exhibition believed Roth succeeded in her goal of reviving German postwar art history. Patrons said they left the exhibit with a greater understanding of the period. “It’s such an exciting opportunity to be seeing this stuff for the first time out of Germany,” Mitchell B. Polonsky ’19 said.  “It’s this lost period of art that is just being to be revived now for the first time in a long time.”
Yet many were conflicted about the content matter given the crimes of Nazi regime, most notably the Holocaust. Michaela Antonis, a Cambridge resident who attended the event, said she felt uncomfortable knowing that some of the artists had been involved in the army and regime. She felt the exhibit lacked a point and didn’t seem respectable given the tragedy of the Holocaust. Indeed, the works in the exhibition scarcely make mention of the genocide that killed six million people, a fact that Roth attributes to the “collective amnesia” of Germans following the war and genocide, a willful blindness to the horrors committed.
Despite the unease of some attendees, other patrons were more receptive to the material. Gavin Moulton ’20, said he felt the exhibition was able to both inform and remain honest about the complexity of German postwar artistic narratives.
“The exhibition does a really incredible job of narrating this complicated story of artists who lived under the Nazi regime and continued to produce art after its death,” Moulton said.
Some students said the goal of the “Inventur” exhibition is to present the art of postwar Germany, not to expunge its crimes.
“It’s a topic that is tough to curate. It’s a topic that is tough to grapple with,” Daniel Rosenblatt ’20 said. “One of the difficulties going through the exhibit is trying to figure out if there is a meaning to the works of art that aren’t depicting clear scenes or images.”
Alexandra Summa ’20 added that“it’s a confused identity.” It is this confused identity that lingers in the minds of patrons as they move through the art pieces depicting artists’ shock at the destruction of the German homeland, despondency as witnesses to its partition, elation at its revival, and failure to properly atone for its crimes. The Harvard Art Museums have brought to life a period of art previously unknown outside of Germany, and, in doing so, have brought to the forefront questions that still remain after World War II and the Holocaust: How do we judge great beauty spawned from a time of great evil?
The Inventur Exhibition runs from Feb. 9 to June 3 on the third floor of the Harvard Art Museums.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Solange Knowles will headline this year’s Cultural Rhythms Festival as the 2018 Artist of the Year, the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations announced Friday.
The acclaimed R&B singer-songwriter will come to Cambridge to receive the award on March 3.
Knowles adds the Artist of The Year award to the several she has collected over the last several months. In 2017, she received her first Grammy Award, was named a Glamour Woman of the Year, picked up her first Black Entertainment Television award, and garnered a Billboard Impact Award.
Knowles's 2016 album "A Seat at the Table" earned critical acclaim and debuted at #1 on the Billboard Top 200 Chart, Apple Music, and iTunes Overall Top Albums Charts.
Her music is known for lyrics that attempt to capture what it means to be a black woman in the United States today.
Asked how he felt about Harvard Foundation’s pick, Associate Dean of Students for Diversity and Inclusion Roland S. Davis at first responded with one word: "Wow!"
“I'm excited," Davis said. "I think that's a wonderful opportunity for the Harvard Foundation, I think it's a wonderful opportunity for students to see to be able to see her, to interact with her, and just a wonderful opportunity for the community as a whole."
"She's phenomenal," he added.
Jackson C. Walker ’21 said he also feels excited Solange will be coming to campus.
“I love Solange a lot, and I feel like having her here at Harvard is such an opportunity, such a privilege,” Walker said.
In addition to her musical success, Knowles is also known for her social justice activism. In the past, she has used her platform as a prominent musician to highlight causes like police brutality and women’s empowerment.
In a speech at the 2017 BET awards, Knowles particularly mentioned women she said inspired her and empowered her to pursue her passion for music.
“I just want to thank BET for my teenage years, giving me images of queens like Missy Elliot and Lil’ Kim and Aaliyah and Erykah Badu and Lauryn Hill and Kelis and Reese and the list goes on and showing me those images and letting me know the sky’s the limit,” Knowles said.
Previous recipients of the Artist of the Year award include Viola Davis, John Legend, and Shakira.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 18, 2018 at 2:05 a.m.
Bearing rainbow-colored signs and wrapped in pride flags, students and faculty crowded into Emerson Hall Friday night to protest Jackie Hill-Perry, a speaker invited by religious group Harvard College Faith and Action who has been an outspoken critic of homosexuality.
Hill-Perry, who writes that she was “saved from a lifestyle of homosexual sin and the like” on her website, has often spoken publicly about her sexual preferences. She claims God helped her see that remaining in a homosexual relationship would violate Christian teachings.
At the event and in days prior, some students criticized HCFA for inviting Hill-Perry to campus, calling her homophobic and arguing she condones conversion therapy, a discredited practice meant to change a person’s sexual identity or orientation.
HCFA invited Hill-Perry to campus as part of its weekly Doxa meeting, a regular gathering during which group members worship, share testimonies, and listen to the week’s chosen speaker.
HCFA co-presidents Scott C. Ely ’18 and Molly L. Richmond ’18 said in an interview Thursday they invited Hill-Perry because of what they called her “compelling story.”
"It was not our intention to promote controversy at all," Richmond said. "We intended this conversation to primarily internal, and we were not intending it to reach that large of an audience."
Nonetheless, both said they welcomed protesters to attend the event.
"[We welcome] everyone that wants to attend and be a part of the event," Ely said. "Doxa's always been a space where we hope to commune, to challenge, to change; that's our group's mission for Doxa."
In her speech Friday, Hill-Perry urged homosexual Christians to deny themselves same-sex relationships out of a sense of duty to God. She spoke to a large crowd packed into Emerson 105, a lecture hall that typically seats around 300 people.
“The model for how we are to deny ourselves, whether that applies to our greed, to our lust, self-denial is not optional for the Christian,” she said.
She added she believes those who pursue same-sex attractions are “broken.”
“There is not such a thing as being born gay, but there is such a thing as being born broken, broken by sin,” said Hill-Perry.
Roughly two dozen students and faculty members attended the event to silently protest Hill-Perry as she spoke. The demonstrators lined up in the back of the lecture hall holding signs reading “One Queer Harvard” and “Gay—It’s in My DNA.”
HCFA member Liam F. Keohane ’19, who said he helped organize the protest, said his goal in demonstrating against Hill Perry was to raise awareness “in the greater Harvard community” about what he called her problematic views on homosexuality.
“People were really shocked about it because normally Doxa, they’ll bring in outside speakers, sometimes they’re controversial speakers, but not especially controversial speakers,” he said. “Certainly not someone who’s on a speaking tour about repressing sexual desire for Jesus.”
Some professors who joined in the protest Friday night said they disagreed with Hill-Perry’s ideas about sexuality.
“The history of this speaker and the things that she keeps promoting are things that basically alienate and threaten the existence of queer students on campus,” said Ahmed Ragab, a professor at the Divinity School. “I think it is a problem to have a speaker that promotes this kind of discourse.”
Other faculty members said they participated in the protest to support queer students at Harvard. Sophia Roosth, a professor in the history of science department, said she attended because she wants queer-identifying undergraduate and graduate students at Harvard to know they can have “a life that is both queer and religiously fulfilling.”
As news of Hill-Perry’s visit spread across campus earlier this week on social media, some students—including some HCFA members—started a petition calling on the religious group to rescind the invitation. The petition has garnered over 200 signatures to date.
“Ms. Hill-Perry, a self-proclaimed Christian activist, has made a career founded on homophobia and ignorance, under the guise of a journey to faith,” the petition reads. “We are deeply concerned that HCFA is giving Ms. Hill-Perry a very public platform to speak about her harmful and hateful beliefs.”
In an email sent to club members earlier this week, members of HCFA’s executive board wrote they were upset by the backlash against Hill-Perry’s visit. But they also wrote that they believed hosting Hill-Perry would prompt important conversations about Christianity.
“The gospel is one which asks much of us. It asks that we recognize our own brokenness and invite God’s redeeming power into all areas of our life—from how we think about our money, to how we think about drinking, to how we talk about people, to how we seek restorative justice, to how we think about our sexuality,” they wrote. “So, we have decided to continue with our speaker tonight, even amidst the concern and controversy.”
HCFA rejects homophobia and conversion therapy "100 percent," according to Ely.
Hill-Perry’s visit comes at a time when students have debated the merits and drawbacks of inviting controversial speakers to campus.
In Feb. 2017, student protesters attended a talk given by ex-pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli. In August, the Open Campus Initiative—a group that aims to “test” the commitment of elite universities like Harvard to free speech—invited controversial scientist Charles Murray to speak on campus.
In an interview after the event, Hill-Perry said she does not endorse conversion therapy. She said that, unlike proponents of conversion therapy—who insist that all homosexual Christians must become straight—she thinks it is acceptable for people with same-sex attractions not to have homosexual relationships as long as they remain single.
“There are some Christians who will always be same-sex attracted but they are also empowered by the spirit of God to live holy lives in light of their same-sex attraction,” she said.
When asked if she believes it is better for a homosexual person to remain single than to enter into a homosexual relationship, she said, “Yeah.”
“Unto the glory of God, absolutely,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

A late offensive spurt from sophomore forwards Seth Towns and Chris Lewis closed out a foul-heavy Friday night as the Harvard men’s basketball team edged Brown, 65-58, at Lavietes Pavilion.
Sophomore guard Christian Juzang’s four triples and a late free throw were enough to propel him to a career-high of 21 points, one point greater than his previous best, set last Friday against Princeton.
Similar to the last time that the Crimson (13-11, 8-1 Ivy League) faced off against the Bears (11-11, 4-5), Harvard coach Tommy Amaker was forced to divert from the team’s typical inside-out gameplan. Lewis tallied his third foul within the first two minutes of the second half, and picked up his fourth with more than 12 minutes still to play. The team’s primary interior presence was able to log just 20 minutes of game action on Friday, five more than his 15-minute outing on Jan. 27 against Brown.
“[Lewis] is our post guy, he’s our post presence and when he’s not on the floor, when he’s not playing well, it really hurts our team,” Amaker said. “When we didn’t have him, we needed to be more efficient running our offense. I think Juzang has a really good stat line, but disappointing that he only has one assist. He’s got to be a guy that runs our offense and makes other people better.”
Despite this dearth of playing time, Lewis capitalized when it most counted. After Bears junior wing Obi Okolie tied the game at 51 with a tip-in off of a missed three, Amaker called a timeout with 4:19 remaining.
After not having many post-up opportunities up to that point, Lewis began attacking the interior with a renewed energy. The Alpharetta, Ga., native flushed home an easy layup, drew a shooting foul two possessions later, and then forced a charge from Brown sophomore forward Joshua Howard on the defensive end to preserve a five-point margin.
Towns was also critical in sealing the Harvard victory late in the contest. The game’s leading scorer displayed a full range of hesitation and crossover moves, one late in the first half that brought his defender—sophomore guard Zach Hunsinger— to his knees.

“I watch a lot of James Harden,” Towns said. “I mean if I see space on the court and they’re not helping as much, then that’s my go. I know my teammates trust me to create a shot for us. That’s one of my roles...to create plays for the team and for myself.”
In the game’s final minutes, the Columbus, Ohio native knocked down a wide-open three to help his team keep a five-point lead at the 3:18 mark before accelerating past his defender for an easy lefty layup one minute later. That finish iced the game at 60-53, and accurate free throw shooting late in the contest—despite an abnormal 65 percent night at the charity stripe—helped lead the Crimson to its eighth conference win.
The Bears fared even worse at the line, converting 53.3 percent of their free throws. In addition, a challenging night from the field for Brown guards Desmond Cambridge and guard Brandon Anderson—who combined for an 11-for-35 shooting night —resulted in the Bears’ lowest point total this season at 58.
Both Cambridge and freshman forward Tamenang Choh were sitting on coach Mike Martin’s bench in the final two minutes, having accumulated five fouls each.
“Cambridge, I think, wasn’t himself,” Amaker said. “You could see that he’s coming off an ankle injury and trying to figure it out a little bit there with him. But I thought we did a better job of trying to play defense on the ball and not giving the lanes to drive to the basket [in the second half].”
Particularly in the first half, Harvard excelled on the offensive glass with eight such rebounds, ultimately finishing with 39 total boards in the contest. Having Lewis on the bench for much of the opening frame, Towns and classmate Justin Bassey were forced to play more isolation basketball, as the team tallied just four assists before halftime.

Neither team was able to build a lead beyond eight in that frame, and the Crimson went into the break holding just a two-point margin at  27-25. Juzang’s three triples and Towns’ 10 points accounted for the majority of those points, as the bench contributed just one bucket.
“It helps when you have players like [Seth] and Lewis to kind of draw the defense so much,” Juzang said. “Tonight was a lot about offensive rebounds, Henry Welsh and Danilo creating those opportunities off the backboard, me just being there and spotting up.”
The second half was more foul-laden, as the Bears sent Harvard to the bonus with nine minutes still to play. The Crimson would return the favor three minutes later.
Brown missed on seven of its 10 three-point tries and Harvard was able to hit shots when it mattered to close out the Bears. The Crimson bench still contributed a measly three points in the latter frame, but Harvard revolved its offense through Towns to complete the victory.

The Harvard hockey program will honor its seven outgoing seniors tonight after a battle with No. 7/3 Clarkson for a crucial two conference points.
Last time out, the Crimson (12-10-4, 9-6-3 ECAC) skated to an electrifying—and strange—tie with the Golden Knights (19-7-5, 11-4-4). After six goals apiece, the two squads left Cheel Arena without a decisive winner. Nevertheless, expect Harvard  and Clarkson to resume the electric play tonight at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Saturday, the Harvard men’s hockey team honored its seven seniors for their contributions to the program over the last four years. But in the Crimson’s 5-2 victory over No. 7/3 Clarkson, it was the underclassmen who carried the way.
A pair of sophomores potted Harvard’s first two pucks before three freshmen guided the group to triumph, burying the game-winner and subsequent two cushion goals.
“Those guys have been able to step up,” said associate head coach Paul Pearl, lauding the underclassmen. “We have some talented kids, and they’re getting opportunities…. You always say, ‘They’re not freshmen or sophomores, they’re a year above,’ when you get [this late in the season].”
After skating past a ranked Boston College team in Monday’s Beanpot consolation game, the Crimson (13-10-4, 11-6-3 ECAC) can add another top-20 team to its list of marquee wins this season.
Both Harvard and the Golden Knights (19-8-5, 11-5-4) were excited to lace them up again after January’s thrilling back-and-forth matchup, which ended in a 6-6 draw. Saturday night’s bout saw some similar stretches of call-and-response hockey.
Entering the second period, the Crimson was outpacing the opposition by a pair of scores. Clarkson wasted little time clawing back into the game, converting on a power play chance just 49 seconds into the middle third.
In the midst of a scrum in front of tri-captain Merrick Madsen’s pipes, sophomore forward Nico Sturm found a loose puck and forced it through traffic, narrowing the margin to just a goal.
“The key, for the coaching staff and for the players, is not to have an ‘Oh, no,’” said coach Pearl about conceding the early-period goal. “That wasn’t the first time someone scored a goal and we had to answer…. We responded really well to that.”
Harvard, preferring to play with a two-score cushion, soon restored the more comfortable lead. Rookie defenseman Reilly Walsh’s bar-down wrister sent a ping reverberating through the Bright-Landry Hockey Center. The goal would prove to be the game-winner.
Walsh’s power play strike marked the third straight game in which the Crimson has potted not just one, but multiple man-up goals. This recent special teams success is somewhat a relief, as Harvard failed to score on 17 straight attempts with the man advantage leading up to it.
“The first power play was really good,” coach Pearl said. “Our second one was bad, and our third one was about to be bad, but we threw one at the net…. Sometimes you have great power plays, and they’re not working.”
Following the Walsh snipe, the Golden Knights remained in a two-goal hole for almost an entire period until Sturm found the back of the net for a second time, once again from in-close on Madsen. The German centerman got rewarded for his persistent play in the “dirty” areas on Saturday night, registering his 11th and 12th goals of the season.
But Sturm’s firepower was all Clarkson could muster, as Madsen (26 SV, .929 SV%) otherwise handled the top-10 team in his return to the blue paint after watching some games from the bench.
“It was Clarkson, that was something that I felt I had the opportunity for a little bit of redemption,” admitted Madsen, who allowed a goal from beyond the blue line before getting the hook in January’s meeting. “I had a chip on my shoulder a bit, but I have played enough games that it didn’t feel weird.”
Meanwhile, the Crimson began to pull away thanks to another power play tally—this time from freshman Jack Badini—and an empty-netter from the stick of Badini’s classmate, forward Benjamin Solin.
Solin’s capstone from half-ice put a bow on one of Harvard’s more complete games of the 2017-2018 campaign. Couple that with the fact that besting the “North Country” teams—Clarkson and St. Lawrence—is never a cakewalk, and you have a content Crimson squad.
“A lot of the seniors had great games too, contributing in different ways,” tri-captain Jake Horton said. “It’s never easy to sweep the North Country, so [I’m] really happy with everybody.”
In the two teams’ previous meeting this season, it took Clarkson all of one minute to light the lamp. This time around, however, Harvard was the first squad to score.
Just under five minutes into the contest, the puck worked its way up to the point and across the ice to junior Jacob Olson. The defenseman fired a puck wide of the cage, where it was corralled by freshman forward Henry Bowlby at the goal line. Bowlby shoved it toward the net and linemate Ty Pelton-Byce was there to punch it home through both skates and pads.
Thanks to the opening tally, Pelton-Byce has nabbed at least a point (2–3—5) in all four games since replacing junior Ryan Donato—currently representing team USA in the Pyeongchang Olympics—as the team’s top-line center.
“Ty is one of those [Swiss Army] knife guys,” coach Pearl said. “Now, he’s thrust into a bigger spot, so you either back off from that or do a good job with it…. He’s such a nifty kid. Everything about his game since the day he got here has improved.”
The Madison, Wis., native’s tip-in wasn’t the only underclassman contribution that the first period had in store. Eight and a half minutes later, sophomore point-man John Marino strode into the offensive zone with the puck and flung it toward the net-mouth as he approached the goal line.
A charging Eddie Ellis made a play for the puck, hoping to chip it past freshman tender Nicholas Latinovich, but the tri-captain never got his stick on it. That’s because he didn’t need to, though, as Golden Knights defenseman Jere Astren kicked the puck into his own net.
After Marino’s first-period goal, Clarkson coach Casey Jones yanked Latinovich from between the pipes and replaced him with the team’s usual starter, sophomore Jake Kielly.
Marino was not the only sophomore blue-liner to make an impact this weekend for the Crimson. Adam Fox, fresh off his first-ever hat trick in Friday’s win over St. Lawrence, looked to be firing on all cylinders against Clarkson as well. The offensive-minded defenseman loomed large on the power play and showed off his nifty mitts with a few precision-passes and dangles around the opposition.
“He’s so smart and has such good hockey sense, that he makes a lot of things out there look easy,” coach Pearl said. “And certainly, as a former defenseman who couldn’t skate—you have to coach him so you can’t let him know that—but you look at him with a little bit of awe, like the little subtle plays he makes breaking the puck out.”
In addition to his stellar goals, breakout passes, and power play coordination this weekend, Fox was in the thick of a very chippy contest on Saturday. After the second-period horn had sounded, the Jericho, N.Y., native took a crosscheck to the back and, upon getting back on his feet, found himself dodging haymakers from Clarkson captain Nic Pierog.
“Clarkson’s always a team that plays a little chippier,” Madsen said. “Once they weren’t getting the results they wanted, they started getting a little chippier, a little more chaotic. I think our guys did a decent job staying out of it. Obviously, there were a couple instances of coincidental [minor penalties].”
With the decisive victory on Saturday night and a solid performance overall in its final regular season weekend at the Bright, the Crimson has clinched a top-four spot in the ECAC and will enjoy an early-March bye week in the conference tournament along with Clarkson, Cornell, and Union.
