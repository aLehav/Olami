After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I want to make people laugh. I want to create a show,” Rainbow Rowell read from her new novel “Landline” at a packed Harvard Book Store talk on September 19. She was quoting Georgie McCool, the novel’s television screenwriter protagonist, whom she mimicked by creating a show of her own, a show where she was the undoubted star. Flashback to 30 minutes earlier: a line had started forming outside the Brattle Theatre even though the talk did not start for an hour, and the Rowell fans already had their tickets. People angling for standby tickets in a different line stared ahead with greedy eyes and waited eagerly for their superstar.
Rowell sauntered on stage before her cue, deeming the HBS spokeswoman’s introduction short but good, and the audience erupted with laughter. Rocking red high-heeled booties—the very first heels she has worn since spraining an ankle in Scotland a few months ago—she strutted with confidence and launched into discussing “Landline.” Georgie and her husband, Neal, do not have a bad marriage, she said. They have two kids and routine lives in Los Angeles; they’re just tired. And the book features a yellow rotary phone that allows Georgie to communicate with her past. “There’s a magic phone in the book. It’s a magic phone, you just gotta move on,” Rowell said.
Rowell dove into a passage from “Landline,” but her reading quickly became a stand-up comedy act, ringing with truth, heart and a whole lot of jokes. Rowell, in fact, didn’t simply read to the audience members; she laughed and paused so they could absorb her enthusiasm and add to that laughter. The “reading” shifted into a conversation as she interspersed her own commentary with the text and brought the house down. When reading a sexually charged sentence in which Neal and Georgie share their feelings about wanting each other, Rowell added snarky sidenotes. “I like to write the romantic, guys,” she said. “George Clooney plays this part.” She followed this one-liner up with self-deprecating humor. “I wrote this scene so nothing really happens. But I feel like those efforts indicate a lot of passion.”
Rowell herself embodies that passion, a spark which first brought her from the world of news and column writing to fiction. Getting started is the hard part, she said. “Once you’ve written a novel, you know you can write a novel.” Rowell likened taking that first step to an episode from the “Little House on the Prairie” television series, a reference she feared would date her even though the Brattle crowd was on the older side. In the “Little House” scene, Mary and her husband must cross a river, and the journey seems so daunting that the producers had to cut the episode in two. “The first time you’re writing a novel, you’re crossing a river,” Rowell said. “When you have a novel completed, you’re confident you can do it.” Rowell is living proof of this statement. It took four years for her to write her first novel, “Attachments”; she wrote her second, “Eleanor & Park,” in three months. According to Rowell, however, the difference between writing “Attachments,” an adult novel, and “Eleanor & Park,” a young adult novel did not lie in the sub-genre distinctions. When Rowell sits down to write, regardless of the setting, she tries to jump into the heads of her characters and access their thoughts and how they would speak.
When Rowell wrote “Eleanor & Park” for a publisher in the United Kingdom, however, she assumed the team would market it as adult fiction. In fact, the book was pitched only to adult editors in the United States. Before deciding to crossover into young adult fiction, Rowell and her team discussed the book’s cover and its ’80s references, which had the potential to be lost on younger readers. But Rowell knew the cultural references would not make or break the book’s accessibility. With her characteristic sass, she reflected on her own YA reading experiences. “When I was a teen reading ‘Little Women,’ I wasn’t thinking, ‘Why are they lighting all of these candles?’” Rowell said. “When I was a teen I was a much more ambitious reader. Now I read half ‘Sherlock’ fan fiction and half my favorite authors, not Joyce.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The audience was in a frenzy by the time actor-writer-composer Jason Segel took the stage at the First Parish Church on Sept. 12. He was there to present his kids’ book “Nightmares!” in conjunction with the Harvard Bookstore and 826 Boston, a creative writing nonprofit organization. Overheard mumblings included questions about Segel’s ability to “keep it PG” for the all-ages crowd, whether or not he would sincerely answer moderator and 826 Boston Program Coordinator Karen Sama’s questions, and how open he would be to discussing “Forgetting Sarah Marshall,” “Freaks and Geeks,” “The Muppets,” and the other projects that have made him a household name. From the moment Segel emerged—sweatered, svelte, and goateed—he was remarkably without pretense. Over the next 90 minutes, he effortlessly juggled an inspiring story of his creative inspirations, an adorable kid-participation interlude, and a prolonged and startlingly open Q&A. Any doubts about Segel’s willingness to fully commit to the event were emphatically put to rest.
Sama and Segel began by discussing Segel’s history with writing. After “Freaks and Geeks” was cancelled in 2000, the 21-year-old Segel found himself out of work. “I was in this weird period where I was too old to play a kid and too young to play a doctor or a lawyer and nobody was casting me,” he said. “I just thought, ‘I’m going to have to live with my parents forever.’” He appealed to his mentor, writer and director Judd Apatow, who had been the creative force behind “Freaks and Geeks,” and found a new direction. “He told me, ‘Jason, you’re kind of a weird dude. Look—here’s what you do now: you write.”
Segel’s first project was a screenplay version of what eventually became “Nightmares.” “I sort of got caught around this age of eight to 10 by movies like ‘Labyrinth’ and ‘Goonies’ and the Roald Dahl books…. They made me feel like I might find buried treasure or that there was still magic out there,” he said. “Every rational voice was telling me it’s impossible to become an actor, to write a movie, to sing songs in movies, to write a book, but I just, for some reason, believe it’s possible…that resolute belief is what it takes.”
The screenplay, Segel’s ode to the career-inspiring media of his youth, sat on a shelf for more than 10 years after he completed it. Then, after the success of “The Muppets,” Segel decided to try another project for kids and began morphing his screenplay into a book. Written with Kirsten Miller, creator of the popular kids mystery series “Kiki Strike,” it is the first book in a planned trilogy about young Charlie Laird, who suffers from horrible night terrors and has moved into a creepy purple house after the death of his mother. The perpetually exhausted Charlie is forced to spring into action after his nightmares begin intermingling with his waking life. Segel explained his decision to pursue children’s literature in particular. “Kids’ imaginations are so much better than what you could put on screen,” he said. “A kid gets to picture these nightmares however she wants.”
Segel didn’t wait long before testing out his thesis about the youthful imagination. He asked for kids in the crowd to tell him their scariest dreams, which led to a number of convoluted and hilarious stories from the under-10 demographic about purple aliens, vats of goo, and close encounters with fish people. Segel wasn’t finished—he next invited kids up to read the first chapter of the book. Three brave souls, all around nine or 10, came to the stage and delivered impressive orations of the initial descriptions of Charlie, his house, and his bad dreams. Midway through the readings, a six- or seven-year-old boy named Luca skipped down the center aisle, asked to read, and proceeded to deliver a spotless, book-on-tape level performance of the end of the chapter. Segel’s mouth was appropriately agape.
The theatricality only increased during the Q&A portion of the event. A nervous fan asked Segel what his favorite show tune was and, after Segel decisively answered with “The Confrontation” from “Les Misérables,” asked him to sing it with her. Rising to the challenge, Segel belted out the first lines (“Valjean, at last we see each other plain”), and the duet improbably began. Segel’s spontaneity shone throughout the event; despite his celebrity, he embraced fully every chance to interact with his fans and seemingly reveled in the intimacy of the event.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Each week this season, Crimson staff writer Jacob Feldman will take you inside the Harvard football team’s strategy in a multimedia notebook. This week, a look at how the Crimson outplayed Holy Cross on both sides of the ball. 
OFFENSE
Playing without last year's three biggest offensive weapons—tight end Cam Brate '14, injured senior wideout Ricky Zorn, and injured junior running back Paul Stanton—the Harvard football team still managed to score points in the 41-18 win over Holy Cross on Sept. 19 thanks to plays like the one above.
The 21-yard pass from junior quarterback Scott Hosch to sophomore tight end Anthony Firkser was set up by a collection of screen passes to speedy wideouts Andrew Fischer and Bryce Walker.
But before we get to what is going on with the wide receivers, look at how this play starts in the backfield.
A zone-read look forces the defenders to pay attention to Hosch and senior running back Andrew Casten. At the same time, the three receivers on one side of the field are setting up for what looks like another screen pass.
Combined, the two elements of misdirection force the defense out of position and create space for Firkser to make a big play. As you watch the play again, keep your eyes on the Holy Cross safety, who comes up to play the run and the screen, only to be turned completely around when Firkser blows by him on his route.
Given that former Harvard president Charles Eliot ’53 once said, "I understand that a curve ball is thrown with a deliberate attempt to deceive. Surely this is not an ability we should want to foster at Harvard," he likely would not have been a fan of the Crimson's offensive strategy Friday. But it worked.
Here is Firkser describing the play from his perspective:
Harvard coach Tim Murphy said Wednesday that the play puts a lot of stress on the defense.
"Obviously, it's very tough to defend," he said.  "Are you aggressive with run support on the screen and then who has got the verticals? And obviously, that's a staple of our screen and screen-pass complement."
DEFENSE
Harvard employed a Cover 3 defense for much of Friday's game. In the scheme, the cornerback closest to the sideline was responsible for staying on the deepest route, with the inner cornerback staying close to the receiver opposite him at first and then backpedaling to cover the area left open by the outside corner backing up.
For visual learners, here is a depiction of that cover scheme for the two corners, along with the safety who can provide help to either.
Holy Cross was able to attack the coverage with a play called Flood in the Harvard system, in which three receivers attack the two corners’ zones, forcing the defenders to make a choice and leave one of the three open. On two occasions, it was the middle receiver who got open for a medium gain.
 
In both instances, the inside corner devoted too much attention to the receiver in the short flat.
“When you have a young secondary, the emphasis has to be, ‘Don’t give up the big play,’” Murphy said while watching the play Wednesday. “Especially against an outstanding quarterback, especially early in the season with young guys, you are going to give up some flat routes, maybe some deep flat routes, and some easy throws, but it’s better than just getting beat over the top by playing too aggressive.”
Murphy added, “I think the thing we might do a little better is play that deep flat route—the No. 2 guy—a little better and giving up the flat, and then come up and tackle.”
The young secondary improved up as the game went on. In a big spot, you can see the corners man their zones perfectly. The inside corner stays on the receiver opposite of him at first, and then buzzes back to get in front of the receiver running the out route. Crusaders quarterback Peter Pujals was forced to check down for a short gain.
On Wednesday, junior cornerback Sean Ahern explained that the defense wanted to challenge Holy Cross to put together long drives. Bend but don’t break. The Crusaders did go on a couple extended marches down the field, but they only managed six points in the second half as Harvard’s defense ultimately helped the Crimson pull away for another season-opening win.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 27, 2014, at 9:32 p.m.
PROVIDENCE, R.I.—Starting your first Ivy League game is not an easy task.
Both Harvard’s and Brown’s signal callers experienced that firsthand, as the two teams opened their Ancient Eight seasons Friday night at Brown Stadium.
After the Crimson (2-0, 1-0 Ivy) fell behind by eight early in the second half, junior quarterback Scott Hosch, filling in for injured starter Conner Hempel, led the squad to a comeback victory over the Bears (0-2, 0-1 Ivy), 22-14.
“It seemed like it was uphill both ways the entire game,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “I’m really proud of our kids. They hung in there, they battled, and that’s all we talk about.”
Clinging to a two-point lead, 16-14, with 4:33 remaining in the game, the Crimson faced a third and 12 at its own 25-yard line. Hosch threw a 10-yard dart to junior wideout Andrew Fischer, two yards short of the first-down marker.
But on the tackle, Brown linebacker Michael Walsh crashed into Fischer and was whistled for a helmet-to-helmet personal foul. The call resulted in his ejection from the game and a fresh set of downs at midfield for Harvard.
Hosch connected with Fischer on back-to-back screens to move the squad down the field before running it in for the score himself. A missed extra point—Harvard’s second failed attempt of the night—gave Brown a glimmer of hope, as the blunder kept the game within one possession with two minutes left.
Brown quarterback Marcus Fuller, starting his second game and first Ivy contest, showed his inexperience on the ensuing drive, firing the ball directly into the hands of cornerback Chris Evans to effectively end the contest.
Hosch, who played a portion of last week’s contest against Holy Cross when Hempel left with a back injury, led just four drives against the Crusaders, as Hempel returned early in the second half. Tonight, with no signs of Hempel coming in, it was all Hosch as signal caller.
“I had no doubt in our offense,” Hosch said. “I know that if we execute we will move the ball down the field.”
The junior, who ended the night with 234 passing yards, recorded the first passing touchdown in his collegiate career early in the first quarter. Hosch lofted the ball into the end zone, where Fischer made a leaping catch to put the Crimson on the board first. A botched snap on the extra point denied Harvard a seven-point lead.
Fischer was Hosch’s favorite target of the day, as the quarterback connected with Fischer 12 times for 115 yards. Hosch’s first start was aided by the return of junior running back Paul Stanton, who was out against Holy Cross. Stanton totaled 123 yards on the ground, including a 43-yard scamper to bring the Crimson within one, 14-13. Harvard elected to kick an extra point rather than attempt to tie the game with a two-point conversion.
“It was just a great run by [Stanton], such a great athlete,” Fischer said. “It’s such a big thing when you have individuals on your offense that can go out and give you a big momentum boost, and that just really helped.”
Throughout most of the game, Fuller took advantage of a young Crimson secondary that has given up mid-range passes to defend the big plays. With less than three minutes left until halftime, Fuller targeted a wide-open Reiley Higgins, who rolled into the end zone to give the Bears the 7-6 advantage heading into intermission.
Pinned down at its own 5-yard line on its first drive of the second half, Brown moved the chains with help from the Harvard defense, which committed three penalties to move the Bears 35 yards down the field. A roughing-the-passer penalty on senior defensive tackle Obum Obukwelu put the Bears in the red zone, and a few runs by Andrew Coke later, the home team extended its lead to eight.
In last week’s matchup against Holy Cross, defensive end Zack Hodges became tied for most career sacks at Harvard, but Hodges and company were largely unable to get much pressure on Fuller until the end of the game. Fuller ended the night with 238 yards, one touchdown, and one pick.
“Hodges didn’t get a sack this week, and I think he got four last week,” Brown coach Phil Estes said. “Our offensive line grew up a lot [this week].”

...at Los Angeles Trade Technical College. Kanye is teaching fashion design as a part of his 250-hour community service requirement after a confrontation with paparazzi. Students at LA Trade Technical College should consider themselves lucky: we can only imagine how much better LS1a would be if Kanye taught it...
Life Sciences 1a                                                                Lecture 5 Notes—Proteins
Welcome to Lecture 5 of Kanye West’s LS1a. I’mma let you finish posting to Twitter and group texting your friends in a minute (an hour and a half to be exact), but I just want to say that proteins are the best macromolecules.
What are proteins? They are the Steve Jobs—they are the Michelangelo—they are the Michael Jordan of macromolecules. They ball so hard other macromolecules wanna fine them, but first you’ve got to find them (in the cell). What’s fifty polypeptide chains to a molecule like this, can you please remind me?
What are proteins made of? Na-na-na that that aren’t amino acids, can’t make the protein stronger. The future proteins needs the amino acid sequencing to hurry up now, ‘cause it can’t wait much longer.
What functions can proteins have? Not one function can have all the power—the cell and body use proteins in many ways!
N.B.: Christian Anfinsen predicted that the overall 3-dimensional shape of a protein relies on the primary sequence of amino acids. Just like how Kim relies on me for fashion advice.
So far we’ve seen that amino acids are living the good life on their own. But they’ve got to shine, and will be even better when linked together.
How are amino acids linked together? In the water I saw it form, the coolest story ever told, somewhere far along the road two amino acids lost a water molecule, to a peptide bond so heartless. How could it be so heartless, stealing a water molecule away from them? But we already know how this thing goes: the carboxylic end of an amino acid says it’s breaking free, saying it wants to link up with the cute amine group of the nearest amino acid that it can see, it takes a couple moments and then you will see, a small water molecule emerges free.
Looking ahead: Tomorrow, Jay-Z and Drake will be collaborating on a guest lecture on amino acids. I will be in Paris (I know that’s cray), so I will finish this lecture next week. Don't forget your TFs Khloé and Kourtney will be holding office hours tonight in Annenberg from 7:30 p.m to 9:30 p.m.
