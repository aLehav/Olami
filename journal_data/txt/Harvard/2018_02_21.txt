After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“We don’t care about your GPA,” reads the website of The Transcript Project. On Jan. 31, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced the Transcript Project to students of the college, a competition inviting Harvard undergraduates to reflect on their transcripts through creative written, visual, or recorded projects. Because many recognize the stress that transcripts bring, Resident Deans hope that the Transcript Project will challenge the one-dimensional way many students view their transcripts.
Khurana wrote to students to “discard the conventional markers of academic success and instead celebrate the uniqueness of your intellectual journey at Harvard” in his announcement of the initiative last month.
Dean of the Arts and Humanities Robin Kelsey said in an interview last month that he created the competition “to offset the many accolades that we have at Harvard for people with immaculate transcripts and to recognize the spirit of adventure which the transcript represents.”
“Vocation was the last thing on my mind when I was a college student,” Kelsey said in the interview. He recognizes that this might be unrealistic for college students today, but he still thinks that many transcripts are “a little bit short on adventure.”
“I definitely see people trying to match their courses with vocational ambitions,” Elm Yard Freshman Resident Dean Jasmine M. Waddell said.
However, some students do make those adventurous choices. Last semester, Sathvik R. Sudireddy ’19 decided to enroll in Professor Kirokosian’s class, Religion 59: “The Real Game of Thrones: Culture, Society, and Religion in the Middle Ages.” “That didn’t fulfill any requirement, but “Game of Thrones” is a story that I love, and the Middle Ages is a time period that I’m fascinated with, so it seemed like I would be doing myself a disservice if I didn’t take a class that I was super interested in,” Sudireddy said.
More students may be taking advantage of unique course offerings. However, this shift has not changed the sometimes overwhelming anxiety experienced by students about their grades.
“Unfortunately, I work with a number of students who get stressed out about their transcripts,” Waddell said.
Adil Bhatia ’20 said that freshmen are especially concerned with grades. “Everyone sort of has that mindset before they come to Harvard,” Bhatia said.
Fortunately, some students said the way they perceive transcripts changes over time. “It’s moved from being obsessed with grades to more just about learning,” Bhatia said.
Because older students tend to have a different perspective on their transcripts, Quincy House Resident Dean Judith Flynn suggested that the Transcript Project should feature the stories of seniors and alumni.
“It would be especially powerful to have seniors who talk about how they stressed out about something and then got what they wanted,” Flynn said.
Other organizations at the College have tried similar initiatives to address this issue. The Bureau of Study Counsel (BSC) created “The Success-Failure Project” which includes multimedia storytelling initiatives such as “Beyond the Success Paradigm” and “Reflections on Rejections.”
The Transcript Project enables that competitiveness to be channeled into something more creative, a format chosen very deliberately to facilitate creativity.
“Much creativity is a combination of freedom and restraint. Often, a certain form of constraint can bring out the best in our ingenuity,” Kelsey said. In this competition, project submissions can fit into three different categories: Read, Hear, and See.
The BSC aims to change perspectives through discussion and reflection rather than competition. Flynn suggests that one strength of The Transcript Project lies in its competitive format, with a $200 Coop gift card as the award for the winner of each category.
“I think Harvard students love competition,” she said.
Kirkland House Resident Dean Soha Bayoumi said that sometimes students are asking the wrong questions. Resident Deans Flynn, Bayoumi, and Waddell all said they hope that the project will prompt people to think differently about their transcripts.
She said that they should be asking, “‘What is this adding to me?’ as opposed to ‘what is this adding to my resume?’”
While the project will not change the way transcripts look, students will hopefully realize that it is not a marker of failure or success.
“I think it’s inspirational for people to talk about the times when they stumbled, when they failed, when they were caught in self-doubt, when they didn’t know what to do and got off track,” Flynn said.
She adds that with the transcripts as permanent records, the emphasis of this project is on what’s not shown on the transcript as opposed to hiding the transcript. “The concern should not be about your transcript, because your transcript is a story. It’s about understanding your story and communicating it, not about trying to alter it,” Waddell said.

Indeed, romance was in the air on Feb. 14 at Boston’s Museum of Fine Art. Couples milled about the museum holding hands and pausing for quick kisses, taking advantage of the museum’s free admission to wander the seemingly endless galleries and enjoy special events and exhibitions in honor of Valentine’s Day.
For the holiday, the museum held free, fifteen minute Spotlight Talks in the photography exhibition, “(un)expected families.” Titled “Friend and Lovers” and led by James K. Leighton, an MFA Curatorial Research Assistant in Photography, the talk dove deeper into the photographic depiction of couples as family. Leighton said, “What’s great about this exhibition is it really spans the history of photography. Since the advent of photography, we as people have just wanted to document what it is to be a family–that experience.” His favorite piece in “(un)expected families” was an untitled photograph by Yasuhiro Ishimoto. “What I love about it is it’s such a tender, loving embrace,” he said of the black and white still of a couple smiling and leaning into one another, a small child lingering in the background.
For one couple, the visit was particularly significant. “Today isn’t just Valentine’s Day for us,” said Lucia Droby, a resident of the area, admiring the museum’s vast collection of Monet paintings with partner Rick Burns. “It’s also our anniversary.” Their 38th, to be exact. The couple celebrated with a trip to one of their favorite places, the MFA. “We were so clever to have our anniversary on Valentine’s Day so that we wouldn’t ever forget,” said Droby. Burns chimed in, “We always do something special on Valentine’s Day and we’re having dinner at the restaurant in the museum here.”
The couple shared their favorite exhibits. Burns liked the American wing, and added, “I really like the way they opened up the Huntington and Fens entrances and really tied the museum back together.” For Droby, that day, it was “Mark Rothko: Reflection.”
“I actually wasn’t expecting to be overwhelmed by that,” she said. “But it was really very deep, it was very beautiful.”
Visitor Alyx R. Henigman, a senior at Boston Conservatory, had a similar experience with the Rothko. “It’s just a lot, it’s a lot to connect the art with his timeline of his life and the complexity of his paintings, but it’s so simple,” she said. She and partner Georgia R. Lipari had come to the museum to catch a showing of “The Princess Bride” but couldn’t get tickets. “It’s my favorite place, and we’re not really like cheesy romantic people,” she said before Lipari interrupted and said, “I don’t know if that’s true!” Lipari particularly enjoyed the photography, adding, “I feel like I was a photographer in another life, it’s so interesting.”
When asked the definitive question, “Who’s more beautiful, your significant other or the art?” the two laughed and embraced. “My significant other,” Lipari said.

It has not been a good week for university unionization. Proponents of student unions at Yale, the University of Chicago, and Boston College have withdrawn petitions to the National Labor Relations Board that served as their best chance to unionize. There seems to be a political motivation here: The NLRB’s membership primarily consisted of pro-union appointees of then-President Barack Obama when it issued its 2016 decision allowing unionization at private universities. With President Donald Trump’s third appointee set for a hearing and confirmation early next month, organizers have expressed concern that bringing their cases to the NLRB would give the more conservative, majority-Trump-appointed board the opportunity to overturn the 2016 ruling.
At Harvard, however, the unionization effort remains fully underway and, so far, unaffected by the changed composition of the NLRB. After complaints about the first election’s validity, a second election has been called and set for April 18 and 19. We have long been in favor of giving eligible graduate and undergraduate students the right to a fair unionization election, and we hope that the one in mid-April serves this role. To that end, both the University and the students aiming to unionize—backed by the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers—must do everything in their power to make the election a procedurally clean one.
If the University or the HGSU-UAW finds fault in the proceedings of the election, they could each appeal to the NLRB, which would give the board a chance to overturn its precedent. This would be an illogical decision, as students at universities who engage in teaching and research and are compensated for it are indeed employed. Therefore, they should have a right to form a union, should they so choose. Pending the approval of Trump’s third nominee, the NLRB could jeopardize this right if given the chance to rule, so both Harvard and HGSU-UAW must proactively work to create an election that requires no NLRB intervention.
That being said, in the case of genuine, serious procedural misconduct on the part of either party, the other can and should exercise its right to appeal to the NLRB, despite the existential threat that doing so would pose to unionization across the country. However, any politically motivated appeals—arising from discontent with the April election’s results—would be doubly harmful because of the chance it would give the NLRB to readjudicate its 2016 decision. This sort of appeal is best avoided by both parties working together before the election to finalize and disseminate fair voter lists as well as determine and widely share when, where, and how to vote. This will not only avoid the procedural errors of the last election, but also encourage widespread participation.
While the University and the HSGU-UAW differ on whether they believe unionization would be productive, they both have publicly shared a belief that students have the right to a fair election. In successfully holding a vote that does not lead to an appeal, not only would they give students the ability to decide if they want to unionize, they would also avoid calling into question unionization at private universities itself. Unionization at Harvard has real advantages and real drawbacks, and we encourage eligible students to familiarize themselves with both and cast informed votes to decide unequivocally and ultimately in April whether or not the students at Harvard should unionize.

When I look back on my collegiate days, I will fondly remember wearing a cumbersome vacuum pack for hours at a time in unseasonal spring heat, damp-dusting hundreds of identical bookshelves and desks—and yes, scrubbing fellow classmates’ toilets.
Seriously—working for Dorm Crew’s Spring Clean-Up over the past few years has been one of my most memorable experiences at Harvard. While some of our dear classmates live so much like animals that their rooms attract actual animals, Spring Clean-Up can be enjoyable and rewarding work despite the unexpected visits from woodland creatures. Transforming a room from an unmitigated disaster to a gleaming triumph in a matter of hours is quite the team effort and accomplishment.I can see The Onion’s sarcastic headline now: “Elitist college student does normal-person job and has ‘life-changing’ experience.” Not entirely unfair. I admit that it does smack of Ivy elitism to turn work that real people do as part of a full-time job into some kind of summer camp character-building experience. Nonetheless, elitist college students can benefit from partaking in solid manual labor. If we want to be leaders of any sort, we need to learn how to do the dirty work, because leadership is not about stature, but stewardship and taking care of your organization and people. You can tell a great deal about a person’s character by watching them mop floors and de-scum showers that you cannot otherwise discern in an academic setting. This is not an uncommon scene: a brilliant Harvard pre-med, star athlete, or prodigal musician is instructed to mop the floor of every room on a given floor by a certain time. They do so by entering each room and first sitting on the bare bed on their phone for several minutes before deigning to move the furniture and wet the mop. When a frazzled and harried Captain comes to check on them, they say they need more time. This behavior hardly exemplifies good character. Yes, you are being paid by the hour, and no one will likely be any the wiser to your languid deceit. But what we do when no one is looking, evaluating, or interviewing us reveals the strength of our character and work ethic.Too often I have seen that our imagined Harvard discipline and attention to detail is actually quite disingenuous, selectively applied to only resume-building parts of our lives. Supposedly, we pride ourselves on the strength of our resolve and willingness to tackle tough problems, our dedication to doing good. If we are only driven and determined in a few parts of our lives, we are not really driven or determined at all.   I have been fortunate, however, to work alongside many individuals who take pride in the long hours of Dorm Crew, do everything they can not to falter or fall behind in their cleaning assignments, and uphold the high standards of cleanliness that their Captains outline for them. Even though I only interact with such people for a few short weeks, it is readily evident that they possess a true and noble work ethic that if it appears while scrubbing toilets, it must surely permeate their entire lives.I’ve worked for Captains with better leadership and management skills than many Business School and Kennedy School students, who somehow manage to turn drudge work into a project the entire crew wants to be excellent. These Captains were equally as up to their elbows in cleaning chemicals and dust, knew that a dozen donuts would lift morale on a Friday morning, and expected quality work from everyone.  Individuals and leaders who are willing to get their hands dirty can reap huge rewards for their organizations. For example, “sweep the sheds” is a first principle for the winningest rugby captain of all time and arguably the most dominant rugby side of all time. Richie McCaw, captain of the New Zealand All Blacks, has a habit of sweeping dirt and other post-combat gunk out of the team’s locker room after a match or practice with other members of New Zealand’s pantheon of rugby greats. It is a literal and deeply symbolic mantra. Andrew Mehrtens, a former All Black flyhalf, describes it as “not expecting someone to do your job for you. It teaches you not to expect things to be handed to you.” The All Blacks have won 86 percent of their matches since this radical cultural shift, and have a winning record against every opponent. We can attend all the leadership development seminars, conferences, and lectures we want. Goodness knows Harvard is full of these opportunities. We can read tome upon tome, ruminate, and hypothesize. But only our willingness to sweep the sheds and scrub the toilets will reveal the content of our character and genuine leadership.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eighteen and freshly married, my grandmother left la isla del encanto, with its endless palm trees and sunsets that dip the world in rose gold, for the graffitied brick of Newark. Race riots engulfed the city, and without any English or standard education, she was on her own to make a better life for her and her budding family.
Life in a factory awaited her.
***
Hurricane Maria twisted its way through Puerto Rico in late September of last year, leaving a wake of wind-scarred lands, ravaged businesses, and broken families in its wake. Months later, the hurricane still has a pulse on the island, breathing and beating in Puerto Rico’s continued difficulties to return power, provide consistent sources of clean water and food, and repair the infrastructural damage sustained by the disaster. A surge in homicide rates has researchers predicting that January will be the most murderous month on the island in two years. Along with an economy rolling in a $70 billion grave with little tax or humanitarian help from the United States or FEMA, the island’s situation is not looking too pretty.
And because of this—because the effects of the hurricane are taking up so much space—Puerto Ricans are deciding that there isn’t enough space left for them.
Waves of these boricuas have left the island. Over 239,000 have moved to Florida since early October. High levels of migration have also been seen in New Jersey, Philadelphia, and New York. Although only 29 percent of Puerto Ricans are born and live on the island, research forecasts that 14 percent more of the island’s population will migrate to the US by 2020 as a result of this hurricane.
***
The road to my grandmother’s house in Puerto Rico wraps around a hill, bends itself backwards under plantain trees and around casitas until the cracked asphalt drops you at her white doorstep. The house started off as just one room: Her father built it out of riverstone for his family of 15 when their first house was destroyed in an earlier fire. Now, there’s two bedrooms and the door in the kitchen overlooks the rolling greens where the family farm lies, nestled. It’s quiet, remote—serene, even.
In Newark, home was a paycheck. The family bounced around from neighborhood to neighborhood, coming and going with the ebb and flow of work. Like most immigrant families, they thought of home the way you flip through books of baby photos—slowingly and sparingly, with a hint of a smile grazing your eyes as you remember the distance between then and now with something like nostalgia or love. It was never a feeling you could tuck into your pocket and save for tomorrow. It was here and now, a pocket of warmth before the next shift started.
***
In Finding Mañana, Mirta Ojito paints a picture of the 1980 Miami coastline: 125,000 Cubans flooded southern Florida in a span of merely six months, seeking political asylum during the Mariel Boatlift. Massive changes were made to the Floridian communities at the price of widespread discrimination of the Marielitos—and a similarsituation might be happening to Puerto Ricans today.
There are important differences between the two to consider: Puerto Ricans aren’t fleeing from a dictator, the means of travel they are using to come to the states are much safer, and boricuas have the title of being American “citizens” (despite having little to no voting voice against bills in Congress that affect them). However, in being thrusted headfirst into a new culture, language, and way of life, both the Marielitos and the Puerto Rican migrants of today face similar issues that stem from the broader issue of Latinx immigrant prejudice.
The Latinx community has for decades been attributed this trope of the “bad hombre” immigrant. Marielitos were called “criminals, homosexuals, and mentally defected persons” as a shallow excuse for horrible treatment in the 1980s. Puerto Ricans today (and for decades past) are being racially and socioeconomically discriminated against, and their “half-citizenship” has been used as a shallow excuse for wrongful treatment. As an increasing number of Puerto Ricans decide to call the United States their new home, America must be careful to prevent the treatment of this mass exodus from transmogrifying into the second coming of the Marielitos.
***
My grandmother’s hands, like metal murcielagos, still fly over knobs and buttons at the screw factory, decades later. Like many other boricuas and Latinos that come to the states, she’s been stagnant at a blue-collar job since she came to this country.
At the end of her shift, she takes off her apron. Though tomorrow she will go back to work, for now, she goes home.

UPDATED: February 27, 2018 at 3:50 p.m.
On February 1st, 2018, the Boston Public Library sent out a fairly typical newsletter with a not-so-typical request.
The blurb read: “Help Us Transcribe Our Anti-Slavery Manuscripts! We’ve recently completed digitizing our collection of historic Anti-Slavery manuscripts, and now we need your help in transcribing them.”
What makes this project truly unique isn’t the BPL’s initiative to transcribe these documents. It’s that they’ve made the task available to the general public.
By now, over 2,000 volunteers have answered BPL’s call for transcribers, and 11 percent of the currently uploaded text has been transcribed. Looking at the comment section of the BPL website, it’s clear that all sorts of people are contributing to the cause—from Boston, the United Kingdom, Australia, and even the Himalayas. “It’s a pretty wide range—social activists, high school kids, school teachers, and genealogists,” Tom Blake, the manager of content discovery at the Boston Public Library, explains.
Why was the BPL soliciting transcriptions for these monumental abolitionist documents? FM hit the books to find out.
On the Digital Commonwealth website, where Massachusetts collections are available online, these antislavery manuscripts are already accessible—but only as images.
“Right now, only the metadata is searchable, but not the content,” Blake says. In other words, people can search for letters by the file name, the author, the size, or the date (metadata), but not by keyword. Since the documents are handwritten, Blake explains “the only way to get the text machine-readable and searchable is to get it transcribed.”
Why is that useful? Transcription will allow the text to be more precisely searchable by researchers or students. “If you want to find every letter that has the word ‘slavery’ in it, or has the word ‘God’ in it, you can’t do that now because it’s just pictures of the letters,” Blake says. “Once the text is uploaded onto the repository system along with the [already existing] images, you’ll be able to do that.”
The initiative forms part of a large effort libraries are undertaking to digitize their content. It’s helpful for scholars who are mining written content for certain words, themes, or topics. This fledgling field, known as “digital humanities,” involves generating machine-readable data sets from written content so that it can aid language processing algorithms and computer learning. As an example, Blake cites the effort to train computers to start understanding handwriting.
“Just in general, we’ve recently become aware of the whole crowdsourcing movement—definitely in the library community,” Blake says.
“It gives people ownership. In general, this is part of the transformation of libraries. There isn’t a segregation between the people who have the stuff and the people who consume the stuff—this is a community. This isn’t an ivory-tower locked-up collection anymore, this is now out amongst the people.”
For this undertaking, the BPL partnered with Zooniverse, a grant-funded research platform with developers in Oxford, England, and Chicago. Since it was founded in 2007, Zooniverse has launched over 100 projects and has over 1.6 million registered users, according to Samantha Blickhan, a fellow for the company.
“We are the world’s largest crowdsourcing or citizen-science platform,” Blickhan says. “We just provide a space for volunteers to aid professional researchers. Humans can still outperform computers at many analytical tasks—that can include pattern recognition, or identification of unexpected findings—and for this type of task, volunteers are able to analyze data more quickly and more accurately than would otherwise be possible.”
In 2016, Zooniverse received a grant aimed at working with archival documents through crowdsourcing efforts from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, a federal agency that distributes funds to libraries. Zooniverse is using the money to identify crowdsourcing best practices in text and archive transcription for archival library files that can’t be machine-read. They solicited proposals from libraries and chose to work with BPL’s anti-slavery manuscripts as one of their projects.
“First of all, it was a really strong proposal,” Blickhan explains. “Their motto at BPL is ‘free to all,’ and they take that incredibly seriously, so there was never a question of whether this information would be free and accessible to the public—it was how do we make it free and accessible to the public.”
So far, the BPL has uploaded slightly more than 12,000 individual manuscripts onto Zooniverse’s transcription software. Much of the correspondence is from William Lloyd Garrison, who edited the famous abolitionist newspaper called “The Liberator.” “It’s what we refer to as one of our ‘collections of distinction’ because of the figures involved, the research value, and the historical importance—it’s traditionally one of the most popular collections that researchers have used here,” Blake says. Also featured are well-known abolitionists like the Weston sisters, Lydia Maria Child, Amos Augustus Phelps, and Samuel May Jr.
The software is easily accessible online, and anyone can type out a letter. Zooniverse has provided tutorials to walk people through the process of transcription. The software ensures accuracy through a triple-check system; any given line is only accepted as correct if it is transcribed the exact same way three separate times. “If people transcribe it incorrectly three times, it’ll get accepted into the system, but I really don’t think there’s any nefarious users out there,” Blake noted.
He says the true value of this project does not lie in this transformation from metadata to text. “More important than the product of this, the transcription itself, is the level of historical engagement that we’re really excited about,” Blake says. For a library, there’s no greater goal.
Just by transcribing these texts, people gain a glimpse into a critical moment in American history, according to Blake. As Blake says, “these weren’t superheroes, these were people who wrote letters to each other and changed the course of history… I think that’s a very powerful lesson for kids, and not just kids, but anyone, to learn these days.”
This article has been updated to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: February 27, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that research platform Zooniverse has developers in Cambridge, England. In fact, Zooniverse has developers in Oxford, England.

"This bus is insane. There’s really no other way to put it. Insane good, insane bad."
"I hate the 1 bus.
I hate the 1 bus.
I hate the 1 bus.
I hate the 1 bus."
"I really didn’t mind this bus and I don’t see why the #1 gets so many bad reviews."
"The person responsible for scheduling the #1 bus appears to have mental capacities equivalent to an infected pustule resected from Sarah Palin’s anus."
Such are a few of the polarizing Yelp reviews for Boston’s MBTA Bus Route 1.
Determined to parse the Real Truth about the nature of this bus, I found myself plodding down Mass. Ave. on a recent balmy Friday morning, Charlie Card in hand.
No sooner had I reached the Johnston Gate bus stop than a series of bizarre events transpired–events usual enough on their own, but tinged collectively with a slight hint of the fantastical, of an elevated sort of reality. (Perhaps Harvard Square is always full of such magic, inconspicuous until you’re standing with nothing to do and a notepad itching to be filled with observations. But I suspected that this sense of anomaly was a deliberate wink from the universe, aware of the epic journey on which I planned to depart.)
It started when a man with twitchy hands and loud feet approached the crowd of waiting passengers within which I was now enmeshed, pointed his finger directly at my chest, and asked in a heavy Boston accent: “You know where the the number one is?”
Honored that he had singled me out as his potential guide, I told him I believed it was coming here, soon. He nodded solemnly.  “Soon,” he repeated, staring off into the distance behind me. I awkwardly attempted to signal that he look in the opposite direction, toward the pavement (over which buses traditionally drive, as opposed to the gated, grassy Yard). He immediately pivoted and began marching down the sidewalk, away from both the Yard and the bus stop. I didn’t see him again.
As I squinted after his shrinking figure, trying to discern where he might be headed, my gaze inadvertently snagged on a different man in the distance who was in the middle of dramatically falling down. People rushed to help him up, but it didn’t look like he was trying very hard to help them help him. He just sort of smiled placidly with his arms crossed over his chest as a steadily growing crowd returned him to verticality.
I began to feel somewhat agitated that the bus still had yet to arrive. The querulous Yelp complaints about the bus’s schedule, I supposed, were right. Evidently I wasn’t the only one with this thought—behind me, a man addressed his concerns to a fully asleep woman on the bench behind me: “‘Scuse me, ma’am, is this where you get the one bus?”
He repeated the line again, verbatim, exactly replicating his speech cadence. And again. How was she sleeping through this? Was she faking slumber? Was she a fake person? Was he? Was I surrounded by prop people and robots who had mostly mastered their appropriation of human nature but were like, still missing a few elements? Who did this to me? Why?
Finally, my long-awaited golden chariot pulled into the parking spot. My fellow riders and I filed in.
This was my moment. Pen poised, I eagerly awaited the uproar Yelp’s denizens had promised. Hell on wheels, someone had written. And I’m not talking about the roller derby/sons of anarchy/railroad boys/tour de France fun kind of hell on wheels.
Bus 1, reveal your truth!
As the bus rolled toward Dudley Station, though, I found, to my disappointment, nothing much to Yelp about.
Yes, the grievances about stop quota were fair. (Boston is a city facing a very serious obesity epidemic and I do not understand why the good folk of Boston can’t walk just one more block, one user had written.) At one point, I wrote in my notebook that “we just stopped 30 feet from the last bus stop oh my god.”
There were a few unusual characters, as many reviews noted. I was particularly intrigued by the man dressed in yellow plaid pants and a trench coat who quietly offered ambiguous drinks to a number of reticent passengers. Also interesting was the heavyset man sporting a cowboy hat and a chain attaching his wallet to his pants, who was also sucking a lollipop. He and the driver shared an energetic exchange about something that was maybe the word “clam trucks” repeated fervently by both parties. It was unclear to me whether they were arguing or simply doing Man Bonding Talk.
Mostly, though, the bus was clean and pleasant.
The clientele seemed generally healthy, despite one user’s assertion that The Number 1 bus is the most statistically robust vector for the transmission of tuberculosis in the City of Boston.”
It wasn’t until the tenth or eleventh stop that the 1 Bus began to resemble the comment that the deepest and darkest level of hell might be akin to riding the number 1 bus all the time.
As we moved away from Harvard Square, the bus became increasingly full. Surely, a large crowd will exit soon, I kept thinking to myself. This was not the case. Each time we stopped, I felt certain that this number of people was the definitive maximum possible capacity for human flesh that can crowd onto a bus; and then we arrived at the next stop, and another pile of humans shoved their way in. I began to feel woozy–oxygen was dwindling, as was the concept of personal space. Smells abounded. A child cried in an excruciatingly high monotone.
Finally, when I could take it no more, I permitted myself reprieve: the next stop would be mine.
And at this moment, as if grumpily denying my petition to exit, the bus inexplicably slowed to a halt–no bus stop in sight, doors tightly sealed–and waited. What did it wait for? I cannot say. I don’t know how long we sat for. Probably thirty seconds, which felt like six years. In that moment I wondered about the ethics of clown cars as entertainment. Why does no one think of the damn clowns? Have they consented to work under such conditions? Why in God’s name would they ever agree to such a thing? Note to self: consider clown unionization activism.
On my Uber ride home (surely, no Toyota Sienna has ever received the unabiding love I lavished on mine that day), I scrolled once more through Yelp’s reviews of the 1 Bus.
My favorite: "Jeffrey doesn’t do buses alone. He can’t. He won’t. But unfortch Jenna C. (my bus ‘buddy’) was busy and I had to suck it up and ride the steel cage of trash all by my lonesome."
Eliya hates people who speak of themselves in the third person, and also doesn’t mind riding buses alone. “Steel cage of trash” seemed extreme. But “unfortch” felt just about right.

Sections
I should have been wearing a helmet; that much was clear.
Instead, I clutch at my brakes, desperately trying to avert crisis. It is already too late: my front wheel impacts the first ridge at full speed, and I jolt forwards, nearly launching over the handlebars. Beneath the oak tree towering out from my left extends a web of roots, cutting veins into a section of pavement already battered and scarred by years of the Boston winter. I brace the balls of my feet against the pedals, attempting to absorb as much shock as I can as Hubway bike #B00558 and I bounce our way down Cedar Street.
I catch a reprieve when I turn onto the much smoother Washington Street and pedal my way up to my destination: Roxbury’s Malcolm X Park.
I dock #B00558 at the Hubway Station on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and enter the park to find Kevin C. Singleton manning a grill amidst his friends. “The Hubway bikes?” one of them exclaims, incredulously. “I ain’t ever used those.”
Established in 2011, Hubway is a bike sharing network owned by the cities of Boston, Cambridge, Somerville and Brookline. According to its website, Hubway reports a monthly ridership of 150,000 rides per month.
Singleton flips the burgers with one hand and pulls a cigarette from his mouth with the other. “I don’t know if you know the history of this street,” he answers, as much to his friend as to me, “but it was built to connect with Route 128 back in the day. But they were taking people’s land, so they stopped it, and now it’s just a road that goes to nowhere.”
He looks at the bike station at the corner of the park. “There’s no bus that comes through this area,” he says. As far as Singleton is concerned, Hubway provides a flexible supplement to Boston’s transit network, an extension for hard-to-reach areas like MLK Jr. Boulevard.
Disparate coverage is hardly his only grievance with the MBTA. “With the fare hikes on the train, it’s almost a thousand dollars a year, and a lot of people can’t afford that!” he says.
For Singleton, these limitations demand an alternative capable of servicing disconnected areas like his neighborhood in Roxbury that still remains accessible to the lower-income communities that frequently populate them.
Cambridge Transportation Program Manager Bill Deignan hopes that the Hubway bike share program can fill this void. “Bike share is a way to make biking more widely available to people in a form that’s like a mini transit system,” he explains.
Since 2011, Hubway has expanded to include more than 160 stations across Boston, Somerville, Cambridge, and Brookline. “People may not have access to a bike or they may not want to bother with maintaining their own bike, so this gives them the ability to ride as often as they like within those four communities year round,” Deignan adds.
One crucial aspect of this “mini transit system” is affordability. On Jan. 19, 2018, Hubway announced its “SNAP Card to Ride Program”, a first-of-its-kind effort to provide reduced cost memberships to participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, more commonly known as food stamps. While typical Hubway memberships cost either ten dollars a month or $99 annually, SNAP Card to Ride offers five dollar monthly and $50 annual memberships, featuring unlimited 60 minute rides.
“Over the coming months we are looking to expand [the discount] for members of additional income-eligible programs,” Deignan adds. In the spring, for example, Hubway plans to offer the same discount to WIC and MassHealth participants, Pell Grant recipients, and public housing residents. “We’re hoping that bike share can become a more affordable option for a greater number of people,” he concludes.
Even with the SNAP Card to Ride program, though Hubway will have to overcome the widely held-perception that it is inaccessible to low income consumers.
Roxbury, where Singleton and his friends reside, is home to 12.9 percent of Boston’s impoverished population. And despite Singleton’s assessment of his local station’s utility, when I park my bike there, I find it deserted, seemingly unused. Indeed, usage data reported by Hubway places the most popular stations near MIT, South Station, and Central, Kendall, and Harvard Squares.
Riding bike #B00310 into Fenway, the situation seems to resemble that of Roxbury—disuse. “No, I can’t afford that,” Jessica S. Ramirez says, replying immediately when I ask if she uses Hubway. She reclines, glancing out over Justine Mee Liff Park. “[There’s] no convenient way to travel around here.”
Andre J. Wilson, another Fenway resident, gives his two cents. “If it was cheaper,” he interjects, “I would get one of them bikes and ride over here from Ruggles, you know what I’m saying?”
“It would be a lot faster too!” Wilson adds. “You don’t got to stop for red lights.”
With 43.7 percent of its residents living in poverty, Fenway ranks among Boston’s most impoverished neighborhoods. Yet while Wilson and Ramirez in many ways represent the SNAP Card to Ride program’s target demographic, both said they were unaware of the new initiative.
Hubway’s effort to expand low-cost services to income eligible consumers represents a bold and creative measure to expand transit access to low income consumers and disconnected neighborhoods; however, the system will need to market itself to people like Wilson, who still doubt its affordability.
“If it was cheaper, I’d use them for sure,” Wilson confirms.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Researchers from Harvard and the University of South Carolina have developed a new kind of airfoil, inspired by shark skin, that may improve lift in aircrafts.
Mehdi Saadat, an Organismic and Evolutionary Biology postdoctoral fellow, and August “Gus” Domel, a Materials Science and Mechanical Engineering doctoral student, joined Ichthyology Professor George V. Lauder to design the airfoil, a cross section of an airplane wing.
Combining their knowledge of shark biology and aerodynamics, the team examined denticles, small projections that are made of the same material as teeth, on shark skin.
“Once you actually put that skin under a microscope and you zoom in and you look at the small features, you realize they actually consist of many complex morphological structures on this skin,” Saadat said. “Intuitively, the most important hypothesis out there was that it’s for reducing drag.”
Saadat and Domel thought about it differently. They hypothesized that shark denticles could produce vortices—essentially a whirling body of air, like a tornado—and that these vortices could improve the shark’s lift, rather than just drag, while swimming. Whereas drag is the resistive force moving parallel and in the opposite direction to the shark’s forward motion, lift is the force moving perpendicular to the motion.
The researchers decided to test whether these denticles could have a similar effect on mechanical aircraft. In particular, they studied the denticles of the mako, the world’s fastest shark.
“We take one of these denticles and we make a representative model,” Domel said. “We put it on the airfoil in different configurations.”
Their experiments confirmed their hypothesis: the denticles significantly increased the airfoil’s potential to generate lift and also reduced drag to a lesser extent. Domel said the discovery could make many aerial devices more efficient.
“If you have an airplane, if you’re increasing your lift and decreasing your drag, the plane has to use less fuel to propel itself forward as well as stay in the air,” Domel said. “You can ultimately benefit the energy of the system, whether it’s generating energy via a wind turbine or reducing energy for an airplane.”
Domel and Saadat said interdisciplinary collaboration was key to their breakthrough. They said they benefited from the expertise of Lauder, as well as Applied Mechanics Professor and materials scientist Katia Bertoldi, Wyss Institute Senior Research Scientist James Weaver, and Dean of Engineering and Computing at the University of South Carolina Hossein Haj-Hariri.
“I feel like in any collaborative project, if you put the right teams together, at the interface of all of that, that’s where the magic happens.” Saadat said.
“You have all the right pieces of the puzzle. And when you have not only the right pieces but also pieces that are all really good at what they do, it really makes for a beautiful collaboration,” Domel added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Lindsay Shepherd, a graduate student and teaching assistant at Wilfrid Laurier University, spoke to an audience of around three dozen about freedom of speech on college campuses Saturday afternoon in an event funded by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.
FIRE, a national organization dedicated to promoting free speech on university campuses, named Harvard one of its top ten worst colleges for free speech this year.
Last year, after Shepherd showed her class an interview with University of Toronto Professor Jordan B. Peterson, who advocates against the use of non-gender-specific pronouns, she was called in to meet with supervisors. She said they told her students in her class had complained about being shown the videos, saying they were transphobic.
The public event was held by the Harvard College Open Campus Initiative, a student-run free speech advocacy organization that brings speakers to campus to challenge conventional  political correctness, which they say limits free discourse.
The Open Campus Initiative hosted Peterson himself for a similar discussion last April. The event garnered protest and campus dissent against Peterson’s appearance. Several transgender students said Peterson’s appearance at Harvard gave a platform to hate speech and threatened their safety on campus.
Shepherd discussed her experience at Wilfrid Laurier, and the aftermath of the video clip controversy. She said she made a Twitter just to deal with the fallout from the incident.
Wilfrid Laurier University has since said that it mishandled Shepherd’s case.
“I think the problem is when you treat a TA like an agent of social justice,” Shepherd said.
She said she showed her class the Peterson clips to expose them to another perspective on gender identity, in the spirit of the “active scholarship” she believes universities should prioritize.
“If we can’t talk about things, then how are we going to improve as people and work out our standpoints on things?” Shepherd said.
Shepherd said she has been inaccurately depicted as a member of the alt-right, because of its association with free speech advocacy in recent years. Shepherd said she thinks political ideology shouldn’t have any stake in the issue.
“I consider myself very moderate,” she said.
After the initial student-moderated interview, audience members were invited to ask questions.
One audience member asked Shepherd whether she would ever speak at a far-right event. She said she would, in order to prove that political ideology does not matter when advocating for freedom of speech.
“I like the way the time was structured. There was so much time still for questions, which is really important,” Olivia K. Bryant ’21 said. “Even if you hear about this story and you don’t agree with Laurier’s decision to exonerate her, for example, it’s really important to be able to come and question what’s going on.”
Emily M. Shoemaker ’21 said she attended the event “because it’s a perspective that I feel like we don’t get a ton of. We don’t always get to hear the stories where someone’s freedom of speech could have been violated.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Graduate student unions at Boston College, Yale, University of Chicago, and University of Pennsylvania have withdrawn petitions to represent students at those campuses before the National Labor Relations Board over the past two weeks.
The decisions to stall unionization efforts come amid ongoing disputes between unionization advocates and universities over recognition of graduate student unions before the NLRB.  The goal, according to organizers and labor experts, is to preclude a Republican-led NLRB from issuing a ruling that strikes graduate students’ right to unionize.
The United Automobile Workers, UNITE-HERE, the American Federation of Teachers, and the American Association of University Professors, which are affiliated with unionization efforts at those universities, made the move in anticipation of a vote by a Senate committee to advance labor attorney John F. Ring’s nomination for the NLRB. If confirmed, Ring would be President Donald Trump’s fourth and final appointment to the five-person board.
Penn’s graduate union, Graduate Employees Together-UPenn, wrote on its Facebook page that the decision to halt legal proceedings was made by its members last week.
“We made this decision in a Special General Body Members’ Meeting on Thursday, February 15, and our petition to withdraw was submitted to the NLRB today, and we are waiting for an official acceptance notice,” the post read.
According to former NLRB chairman William B. Gould IV, the board is likely to reverse the standing precedent on graduate student unionization after a third Republican joins the board.  A 2016 NLRB ruling directed at Columbia University established the most recent precedent for graduate student unionization under the National Labor Relations Act.
“I think one of the first issues on which the board would like to provide a reversal is the precedent that emerged during the Obama board’s tenure,” Gould said.
The impact of the rescinded petitions on Harvard’s upcoming unionization election, scheduled for April 18 and 19, is unclear. Even if union advocates prevail in April, a change in the NLRB’s position could endanger a graduate student union’s authority to collectively bargain with the University.
Unlike the cases at other universities, the UAW’s petition to represent Harvard’s graduate and undergraduate teaching and research assistants is not currently pending before the NLRB. Per a 2016 election agreement between the University and Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Automobile Workers, Harvard has not asked the NLRB to reconsider its position on graduate students’ employment status.
In the wake of the withdrawals, Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran sent an email to students on Friday stating that preparations for Harvard’s unionization election will proceed as planned, despite the developments at other campuses.
“The UAW has not communicated an intention to withdraw its petition to represent Harvard students holding teaching or research positions, and the University is therefore moving forward with identifying eligible voters for the election currently scheduled for April 18 and 19, 2018,” Curran wrote.
HGSU-UAW organizer Andrew B. Donnelly wrote in an email that he would disapprove of any changes to the University’s original position in 2016 due to changes in the composition of the NLRB.
“When Harvard attorneys signed the initial election agreement in 2016, they indicated that they would bargain with us in good faith if we won. Like many of us, they thought Hillary Clinton would be president,” Donnelly wrote in an email. “For them to change their position because Donald Trump is president would be political opportunism at its worst.”
University of Oregon Professor of Labor Education Gordon Lafer wrote in an email that he expected Harvard administrators to take advantage of the Trump board’s “anti-labor orientation,” adding that doing so would be “entirely unprincipled.”
“They're all happy to jump on any excuse, including taking advantage of the Trump administration's anti-labor orientation, to deny the democratic voice of grad students or anyone else they can,” Lafer wrote.
University representatives declined further comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Assistant Director of Student Affairs Caysie A. Carter will now serve as the Title IX Coordinator for Harvard’s Graduate School of the Arts and Sciences, the school announced last week.
Carter, who joined GSAS’s Office of Student Affairs in December, previously served as a Title IX Coordinator at Boston University. She will join Seth Avakian, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ officer for Title IX and professional conduct, in responding to Title IX-related complaints at GSAS.
Harvard’s 12 schools employ more than 50 coordinators to oversee the University’s compliance with gender equality provisions in the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Carter wrote in an email she is excited about her new role.
“Since I joined GSAS in December, I’ve really enjoyed getting to know graduate students and learning more about Harvard,” she wrote. “I’ve already begun working closely with Seth Avakian in supporting GSAS students and have started connecting with my colleagues across the University who serve in similar roles.”
GSAS Dean for Student Affairs Garth O. McCavana said he hopes Carter will be able to address graduate students’ concerns relating to the law.
“GSAS is committed to providing resources for graduate students, and we’re pleased to be able to add this important student-facing position,” McCavana said. “I am delighted that Caysie has joined the team and know that the experience she brings to the job will greatly benefit our students.”
Carter’s appointment comes amid increased federal scrutiny of the University’s handling of Title IX-related matters.
In November 2017, the Department of Education launched an investigation into GSAS for insufficient compliance with Title IX.  Federal investigators are currently examining GSAS administrators’ response to a student’s sexual assault complaint against a peer.
The Education Department is also studying GSAS’s alleged failures to adopt and publicize appropriate procedures for responding to sexual assault and publish notices of nondiscrimination.
The probe joined two other ongoing Title IX investigations into Harvard, launched in 2014 and 2016 respectively.

A crowd of around 50 Harvard affiliates and Boston residents gathered in front of the Graduate School of Design’s Gund Hall to protest Mayor of Chicago Rahm I. Emanuel’s appearance at the GSD on Tuesday.
Hosted by the Answer Coalition Boston and the Party for Socialism and Liberation Boston, the protest was organized to publicly criticize the Chicago mayor’s policies.
“We seek to gather to denounce the crimes of the Rahm Emanuel administration against poor and working families, especially Black and Brown communities of Chicago,” read a Facebook event page created to organize the protest.
For two hours Tuesday night, protesters chanted slogans including “Rahm Emanuel you’re a tool, hands off Chicago’s public schools!” and “From Palestine to Chicago, Emanuel has got to go!” They also held signs reading “#ResignRahm” and “No closed schools, no cop academy,” in reference to a planned $95 million police academy announced by the Emanuel administration.
The protest did not interfere with the event itself, where Emanuel discussed his tenure as Chicago mayor with GSD Dean Mohsen Mostafavi. The conversation was co-sponsored by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies and the Design School’s Office of Communications.
Emanuel has been met with protests at his recent visits to other college campuses as well, including at UCLA and the University of Michigan. After previous protests, Emanuel’s spokesperson Adam Collins told the Chicago Tribune that the dissent was "no surprise."
“Anyone who has spent any amount of time on any college campus has probably protested something at some point. There’s really no surprise here,” Collins said.
The Facebook event page for Tuesday’s protest accused Emanuel of responsibility for and complicity in gentrification, police brutality, and austerity across Chicago.
“Rahm Emanuel, and the Democratic Party machine of which he is part and parcel of are no friend to poor, working people, people of color, or any progressive minded person,” read the protest event’s description.
Last week, students at the GSD penned an open letter to Emanuel signed by nearly 70 Design School students and community members, and sponsored by the GSD African American Students Union and the Harvard Urban Planning Organization.
Jaydee Davis, a member of the Answer Coalition Boston, said the goal of the protest was to disrupt Emanuel’s arrival at Harvard by demonstrating against his controversial policing and schooling policies.
“We did not want to let him speak at Harvard with no repercussions,” Davis said. “We need to join forces and stand in solidarity against him.”
A University spokesperson could not be reached for comment Tuesday night.

Harvard sold its holding of a popular exchange-traded fund, ProShares, prior to a large dip in value that occurred in the stock market in early February, allowing the University to avoid over $10 million in losses.
Bloomberg reported on Feb. 9 that Harvard Management Company, the investment management team that oversees Harvard’s endowment, sold shares of “ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures” valued at $11.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.
ProShares, also known by its ticker SVXY, is a popular exchange-traded fund that bets on stable markets. Exchange-traded funds are securities that track a group of assets, which could range from shares of stock to physical commodities. Unlike a mutual fund however, an ETF can be traded like stocks. As a result, ETFs change in value as they are traded.
ProShares ETF dropped over 90 percent in value as a result of a market rout that began in early February. The stock market dip was the biggest plunge in seven years. On Feb. 5, the Dow Jones industrial average was the biggest single-day point drop in history. ProShares traded at $93 or above for months, but, as of market close on Tuesday, ProShares was trading around $12.
Harvard Management Company has been actively attempting to reverse more than a decade of poor investment performance in the last year. N.P. “Narv” Narvekar was hired in December 2016 and quickly made sweeping changes—drastically cutting staff and spinning off many of its investments previously managed in-house to external managers.
Harvard maintains the largest university endowment in the world at $37.1 billion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 22, 2018 at 7:55 p.m.
Multiple members of the Undergraduate Council alleged Harvard did not adequately take student input into account in its recently completed presidential search at a Council meeting Monday.
UC representatives raised these objections after Nina Srivastava ’18, one of three undergraduates who served on the University’s presidential search student advisory committee, presented a summary of the committee’s work. Srivastava refused to tell the UC whether newly selected University President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow met the recommendations of the student advisory group.
While representatives did not criticize the work of the student committee, many questioned whether the official presidential search committee—comprising members of the Harvard Corporation and the Board of Overseers—adequately considered students’ advice throughout the search.
At Monday’s meeting and in subsequent interviews, some Council members said they doubted whether students substantially influenced the search committee’s final choice.  Many promised, though, that they would remain open-minded about Bacow.
In an interview after the meeting, UC Parliamentarian Sonya Kalara ’21 said she thinks Bacow’s insider status—he served on the Harvard Corporation and the search committee prior to being named University president—shows that Harvard did not sufficiently consider student input.
“It seems like Larry Bacow was chosen from the search committee and he’s on the Corporation which doesn’t show a lot of substantive effort in engaging with the rest of the Harvard University system,” Kalara said.
In an emailed statement Monday, University Spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson pointed to an email search committee chair and Corporation senior fellow William F. Lee ’72 sent to Harvard affiliates last week announcing Bacow’s selection.
“Our gratitude goes especially to the members of the three advisory committees—of faculty, students, and staff—who worked so hard and contributed so much to informing the search committee’s deliberations, both by sharing their own views and by eliciting robust input from many others,” Lee wrote.
UC President Catherine L. Zhang ’19 wrote she was also concerned by what she called a lack of student involvement in the presidential search in an email Tuesday.
“The advisory committee did a great job of collecting student input and voices but the fact that they were not directly involved in the search and instead simply an advisory board deeply troubles me,” Zhang wrote.
“There has been a consistent lack of student voice in any decision making process and that is something that needs to change,” she added.
Quincy House Representative Sarah S. Fellman ’18 agreed.  She suggested that, in the future, the search committee should include students and faculty among its members.
Srivastava said Monday that the advisory committee plans to present a final report summarizing its findings to Bacow in the coming weeks. She declined to say whether the committee’s recommendations will be released publicly.
At the meeting, Mather House Representative Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18 said he hopes that future presidential search committees will publish summaries of student advisory committees’ recommendations. Gonzalez said he thinks publication would allow the public to directly discover how chosen candidates stack up against advice students submitted throughout the search.
“I think that would be a great way for the students across all schools of the University to see that the search committee is taking the advisory committee seriously and is listening,” Gonzalez said.  “We can then basically vet the presidents on whether or not they matched the stated characteristics that the search committee took from the advisory committee.”
Former Quincy House Representative Wyatt M. Robertson ’18 said that, though he—and others—had hoped the search committee would choose someone from an underrepresented background, he thinks students should give Bacow a chance to show his commitment to underrepresented groups on campus. He specifically cited recent efforts to establish a multicultural center as a potential barometer of Bacow’s true commitment to these groups.
“I would just love to see if he can really get behind some of these issues that I think students were hoping a more diverse president would most likely get behind,” Robertson said.
Robertson also said he hopes Bacow will incorporate student feedback prior to make consequential decisions for students.
This article has been updated to reflect the following clarification:
UPDATED: February 22, 2018
A previous version of this article implied Wyatt M. Robertson '18 is a current Undergraduate Council representative. To clarify, he is a former representative.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s tennis team traveled to New Haven, Conn., this weekend to face its first Ivy competition this season at the ECAC Championship tournament. Hosted by Yale, the tournament saw participation from seven of the eight Ivy institutions.
Hoping to bounce back from a 1-2 performance at the tournament last year, the Crimson (9-2) entered the tournament at the No. 2 seed. Facing off against No. 7 Brown on Friday, Harvard clinched a 4-1 victory to advance to the second round against Cornell on Saturday. The Crimson managed to top the Big Red 4-1, securing a spot in the finals against No. 1 seed Dartmouth (12-0) on Sunday.
Harvard’s win streak came to an end on that final day in the matchup against the Big Green. Although the team fell 4-1, its 2-1 performance this weekend marks a strong start to the season and displays the team’s competitiveness among the Ivy circuit.
HARVARD 1, DARTMOUTH 4
The ECAC finals this Sunday began with fierce competition. Dartmouth earned a doubles point early on with a win at third doubles over senior Grant Solomon and junior Christopher Morrow. The Crimson came back at first doubles, when senior Kenny Tao and sophomore Logan Weber resurged  to clinch a 7-5 victory. The Big Green ultimately took the doubles point with a win at No. 2, defeating co-captain Jean Thirouin and junior Andy Zhou.
Going into singles, the Big Green claimed two straight singles points. Rookie Robert Wrzesinski fell to his opponent 6-2, 6-1 at fourth singles, before Thirouin suffered a loss at the hands of Dartmouth sophomore David Horneffer at third singles.
Zhou then earned Harvard the only point of the day with a straight set victory over his Big Green opponent freshman Dan Martin at second singles. The win was not enough, however, as Dartmouth sealed its victory on court five. In spite of pushing the match to an extra game in the second set, Solomon ultimately fell to his opponent 6-1, 7-5, to give Dartmouth the ECAC Championship title.
HARVARD 4, CORNELL 1
The Crimson took an early lead in doubles play with a win from Morrow and Solomon at third doubles. At second doubles, Thirouin and Zhou fell in close tiebreaker to their Big Red opponents. It came down to first doubles, where Tao and Weber earned the final match earning Harvard the doubles point after managing to hold off their opponents and clinch a 7-6 tiebreaker win.
The Crimson went on to dominate in singles play, sweeping the next three out of four points. Tao swept his Cornell opponent David Volfson in straight sets 6-4, 6-3 at first singles. Solomon then earned a critical tiebreaker win in the first set of his match before giving up the second set, but ultimately came back strong in the third set to give Harvard another point at fifth singles.
Wrzesinski fell to his Big Red opponent Daniel Grunberger 6-3, 6-3 at fourth singles, giving Cornell its first point of the day. In the game deciding match at sixth singles, junior Andrew Ball earned a tiebreaker win in the first set, but fell 3-6 in the second set to give Cornell a chance. He came back in the third set to clinch the win, giving Harvard the win and advancing the team to the finals.
HARVARD 4, BROWN 1
For only the second time this season, the Crimson struggled to secure the doubles point and gave the Bears an early 1-0 lead. Brown won both second and third doubles 6-3, canceling out an early advantage from Tao and Weber’s win at first singles.
Harvard came back strong in singles play, however. Tao defeated Brown senior Jack Haworth swiftly in two sets, 6-2, 6-1. Ball earned a straight-set win at sixth singles. At second singles, Zhou clinched a tiebreaker win in the first set and went on to sweep the second set 6-1 to give Harvard a 3-1 advantage.
The match came down to a nail-biter between Solomon and sophomore Peter Litsky. After falling 1-6 in the first set, Solomon came back to clinch the second set 7-5 and then sweep the third set 6-3, giving the Crimson its first win of the weekend.

The Harvard Ski team competed this weekend in the Williams Carnival. Among a field of competitive teams comprising the Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association circuit, the Crimson improved upon its own previous performances to score 273 points across both genders and disciplines. The Nordic team competed in Woodford, Vt., where junior Hannah Hardenbergh led Harvard on both Friday and Saturday, while the Alpine team stayed closer to home, racing in Western Massachusetts.
In the Nordic events, Hardenbergh led the way with a solid 16th place finish in the 5K classic race on Friday and returned on Saturday to lead the Crimson again with a 12th place finish in the freestyle race. Also finishing strong for Harvard, junior Nina Armstrong, sophomore Tegan Thorley, and senior Charlotte Cole skied close together in both the classic and freestyle races. Armstrong led the pack, finishing in 28th place in both events with times of 18:30.3 and 10:06.3 in the 5K and freestyle, respectively. Thorley was the third scorer for the Crimson on both Friday and Saturday coming in 29th in the 5K and 37th in the freestyle race. Cole finished just behind Thorley on both days, coming in 30th and 38th places.
On the men’s side sophomores William Rhatigan and Mackinley FitzPatrick posted the best finishes of the weekend. In the 3.8 kilometer freestyle race, Rhatigan paced the team with a time of 8:45.90, coming in 36th. In this event, senior Connor Green finished in 51st with FitzPatrick also scoring a 54th place finish.
In the 10K classic, FitzPatrick led the way, taking 41st and finishing in 32:59.40. Rhatigan was right on his heels, coming in 42nd place and crossing the finish line just six seconds after FitzPatrick.  Junior Jacob Meyerson was the third scorer in the 10K, placing 53rd in a highly competitive field of racers.
For the Alpine racers, freshman Nellie Ide followed up on her strong performance at the Dartmouth carnival last weekend with another top 25 performance in the Slalom race taking 23rd in 2:12.37. In the Giant Slalom, senior Kelley Steeves was the only racer to finish both runs in the women’s field, coming in 45th place with a combined time of 1:53.80. Steeves also scored in the Slalom race, coming in 49th. Coming in right after, freshman Allegra Coleman contributed to the team score, placing 50th.
“It was another tough weekend with some major highs and some tough lows,” Coleman said. “Nellie Ide had a strong performances in the Slalom.”
On the men’s side, sophomore Carter Kendig and senior Pieter Weemaes both qualified for second runs in the the men’s giant slalom with Kendig leadking the way for Harvard and taking 37th in the giant slalom and 35th in the slalom.
In the Slalom race, junior Dennis Bao and sophomores Lars Hornburg and Robert Dorfman also qualified for second runs. Making the most of this opportunity, Dorfman, Hornburg and Bao finished in 47th, 49th and 50th, respectively.
“Tough to see from the results, but ths Slalom was a huge day especially for the men’s team,” coach Scott MacPherson said. “The field was packed and deteriorating conditions made any movement hard, but we qualified five of our six athletes into the second run. The hard work and consistent training is paying off.”
