After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Giving “Cats” one star is an unfortunate concession rooted in disgusted pity. “Cats” makes you want to physically remove your eyeballs from their sockets, no matter the cost. The most relevant question in regards to this film is “who asked for this?” The obvious answer is no one. Let’s talk about why.
“Cats” is nearly two hours long — frankly, too long for what flashed before my eyes. For those who have never seen the original musical nor read T.S. Eliot’s “Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats,” a poetry collection upon which the script is based, here’s a short plot review: Jellicle Cats are cats with specific traits. They hold a talent show for Old Deuteronomy (Judi Dench), the cat who decides who will earn a new chance at life after going to the Heaviside Layer. The endless song and dance routines are centered around their personalities: Expect to be regaled with hideously anthropomorphic mice and cockroaches, fur coats (is that even ethical?), and acrobatics that belong in adult films.
Pondering “Cats” is like pondering the decision to build Boston's Logan Airport on a landfill: It shouldn’t have been done (in the event of an earthquake, the airport will sink into the ground), but at this point, there’s no going back. Thanks to the sheer number of times the word “Jellicle” appears in the song “Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats,” it now provokes the same shiver-inducing response as the word “moist.” After watching the movie, go home and take a shower, hot or cold.
“Cats” is uniquely bad because the creators could not figure out how to present the characters. The music is largely fine — in musicals all the songs tend to sound the same by the end, but it was pleasantly surprising to be able to distinguish among the songs even after 90 excruciating minutes in a reclining chair. Each musical number is a blessing and a curse, because the rhythms distract for the visual horror, while also being a vehicle for said visual horror: The cats look like they are all about to have sex with each other. All the time.
It takes a while to understand why “Cats” is so disturbing. Yes, every character looks like they’re on their way to, or are currently at an orgy, though there’s more to it than that. (The only character for whom this works is Jason Derulo’s, because he quite literally plays a tomcat.) The movie’s creators could not decide whether the characters would simply be CGI versions of people wearing cat costumes, and thus move like regular humans, or if they would be truly feline. The result was a disjointed mashup between the two species, such that every movement is indeed catlike, but with the added “bonus” of being, to our eyes, recognizably human. The effect is profoundly creepy and over-sexualized.
Our main character, Victoria, appears to be a ballet prodigy. This seems like a great idea, but it of course means that even walking down the street will transform into a catlike version of ballet with none of ballet's grace. One can use the word “disturbing” only so many times, but that’s what it looks like. This adjective is also the perfect descriptor for the cats nuzzling each others’ faces — though perhaps this is better than kissing — or for the hisses interspersed throughout the movie. Both these actions are perfect examples of the creators not thinking through proper demarcations of human and cat traits.
The reason behind these stunningly poor animation choices is even more anger-inducing. Forget about the mediocre CGI, the weirdly out-of-scale set, the moment when Victoria drinks milk like it’s beer on tap, or when Ian McKellen licks water out of a bowl — those are the symptoms of a greater problem. The Hollywood Reporter noted that “Cats” “cost $100 million to make after tax rebates and incentives (and not including marketing costs).”
This means two things: First, we live in a society that finds it not only acceptable, but laudable, to spend $100 million on a movie of such poor quality.
Second, adding insult to injury, it means that hundreds of people heard the premise of this film, thought it was a good idea, and decided to participate in its production. The very existence of “Cats” is a testament to the fact that more than one person believed this movie must be made, and that no one used even one of their brain cells to say “maybe we shouldn’t do this.”
(That the movie made approximately $40 million is also a crime.)
The recognizable actors will now have to live with the knowledge that they were cast in this abomination, and the star-studded list of performers is long: Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Taylor Swift, James Corden, Jennifer Hudson, and Rebel Wilson, among others.
And as for the film itself? Finally, the Jellicle Choice is made, and one of the cats flies off to the Heaviside Layer. Dawn arrives — a metaphor for the audience’s growing relief that the nightmare will soon be over — and Old Deutoronomy breaks the fourth wall to address the audience and say that cats are like humans, cats are not like dogs, and one must address cats with their proper names. Apparently they resent familiarity. It was at this point that I felt my soul leave my body.
After nearly two hours of insanity, and within the context of the film, the decision to bludgeon the audience with Eliot’s concerningly strong musings about cats is not out of the ordinary. Someone clearly got their kicks from making “Cats,” because it was not designed for the viewer’s pleasure. Why not include a two minute speech entirely unrelated to 99 percent of the rest of the film? By this point, the viewer is already dead inside.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard and MIT received $1.4 million from the United States Agency for International Development in December to study and evaluate reforms to the government of Indonesia’s social support programs.
Indonesia’s social protection programs have come under scrutiny in recent years for issues with fraud. In 2012, Raskin, Indonesia’s largest social assistance program, had a $1.5 billion budget to provide subsidized rice to the bottom 30 percent of income distribution in Indonesia, which has a population of over 250 million, according to the Jameel Poverty Action Lab. But for every 100 kilograms of rice leaving a government warehouse, only 50 kg were delivered, according to a press release from USAID spokesperson Tiara S. Barnes.
In 2016, the Indonesian government announced that it would reform the way Raskin and five other social service programs deliver aid by 2022, using monthly digital vouchers deposited directly into the bank accounts of eligible households.
Harvard and MIT will be working with USAID to evaluate these reforms, comparing delivery of social assistance via electronic and traditional methods in 105 districts, according to the USAID press release.
Rema N. Hanna, a Harvard Kennedy School professor who chairs the International Development Area, is one of the researchers who applied for and received the funding.
Hanna wrote in an email that the transition from an in-kind transfer system like Raskin to digital food stamps has many potential benefits. For instance, the current reforms could reduce leakage of rice and improve its quality because citizens could go to any shop to buy better rice or other nutritional foods, rather than relying on government-distributed rice.
“But there are also risks,” Hanna wrote. “There could be leakage if the cards do not get in the right hands. Or, if there are not enough shops nearby that accept the cards, there may be little choice where to buy. That could lead to hold-up problems, and higher prices.”
Hanna — who also serves as the scientific director of the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab Southeast Asia Office in Indonesia — wrote that the funding will help researchers travel into the field and analyze data.
“Right now, we have conducted the survey for government officials and are doing field visits. We are also deeply engaged in the data analysis of the impacts on citizens, and hope to have results soon,” Hanna wrote.
Harvard and MIT’s research will help build evidence for scaling these reforms nationwide in Indonesia, and the research could also help other governments interested in improving their social assistance programs, Barnes wrote.
The award was given through the USAID Development Innovation Ventures, a program that provides support to solve social problems in countries where USAID operates.
“We are excited about the partnership with the USAID DIV program,” Hanna wrote. “Research support to help generate evidence on large-scale policies and programs in developing countries is key if we want to know how to better design reform that can improve the lives of the poor.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The writer Elizabeth L. Wurtzel ’89, whose audacious 1994 memoir “Prozac Nation: Young and Depressed in America” canonized her in the confessional genre, died of metastatic breast cancer on Tuesday. She was 52 years old.
Wurtzel was raised on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She left what she characterized as an unhappy home to attend Harvard College, where she spent four drug-fueled years.
“I cannot deny that I have spent a fair amount of my time at Harvard at final clubs. I have drunk their liquor, snorted their cocaine, smoked their pot, popped their ecstasy, eaten their food and danced on their floors,” she wrote in The Crimson in a 1988 opinion piece about the sexism of final clubs. “But of all the stupid and morally questionable things I have done in the name of a good time—and there have been a few—I cannot forgive myself for hanging out at final clubs.”
Wurtzel eventually expounded upon her gritty undergraduate experience beyond The Crimson’s pages. She began writing “Prozac Nation,” the book that would eventually make her famous, while she was an undergraduate.
That unflinchingly candid memoir — originally titled “I Hate Myself and I Want to Die” — received mixed reactions when it was published in 1994, ranging from disgruntled to grudgingly beguiled.
Michiko Kakutani wrote in a New York Times review that, like Wurtzel, the memoir was rich with contradictions.
“By turns wrenching and comical, self-indulgent and self-aware, ‘Prozac Nation’ possesses the raw candor of Joan Didion's essays, the irritating emotional exhibitionism of Sylvia Plath's ‘Bell Jar’ and the wry, dark humor of a Bob Dylan song,” Kakutani wrote.
But aside from sex and drugs, Wurtzel was passionate about rock n’ roll, rounding out the triad of obsessions that defined many of her cohort.
Wurtzel wrote about rock for The Crimson while attending the College. In those pieces, her normally caustic tone softened into elegy.
“The album hits its peak when Reed assays the extremes of his emotional range,” she wrote in a 1986 review of a Lou Reed Album, which won the Rolling Stone College Journalism Award. “‘Temporary Thing,’ with its high-pitch backbeat and religious-chant vocals, delves into Reed's usual sphere of bad relationships, bad karma, and bad moods. It isn't pleasant, but it is pure and passionate, and it leaves us with Reed's optimistic message that even the worst of things is just a temporary thing.”
After graduation, Wurtzel wrote about music for the New Yorker. Eventually, though, a 1992 leadership transition marked the end of her column.
She then went on to publish “Prozac Nation,” which clambered to the top of the New York Times bestselling paperbacks list and carved out a literary niche for the confessional style.
Deborah Copaken ’88, whom Wurtzel befriended in college, wrote in an email to The Crimson that “confessional Liz” had a lasting influence on young female writers.
“She showed every great young female writer writing today that their experiences, as young women, matter and are worthy of narration. Look at Emily Gould, Jia Tolentino, name any young female writer you admire right now, and I can guarantee they either knew Liz personally, as she was always collecting them like beads on a string as friends, or they read her work and were moved to write their own words,” Copaken wrote.
Amanda S. Brainerd ’89, another Harvard friend of Wurtzel’s, wrote in an email that the writer’s legacy would last for generations to come.
“Liz was complicated — infuriating even, but her literary fearlessness and unapologetic obsession with herself created a new genre of memoir. Her impact will resonate for years; Liz was a brilliant and irreverent rule breaker,” she wrote.
Wurtzel’s lifelong friend Roberta F. Brzezinski ’89 described her former college roommate’s heroine status to many who knew her, and some who didn’t.
“She was a downtown icon. She could get a table in any and any restaurant in the Village — her and her dog would be there,” she said in a Friday interview. “But she’d always be wearing some t-shirt. She was really into t-shirts.”
Wurtzel followed “Prozac Nation” with “Bitch: In Praise of Difficult Women” in 1998 and “More, Now, Again: A Memoir of Addiction” in 2001.
Then, a change of pace: Wurtzel was admitted into Yale Law School in 2004. After graduating, she practiced law for a few years, but eventually turned back to writing.
Her later work intimated greater peace of mind. In a 2014 New York Times essay, “Getting Married Easy,” Wurtzel described falling in love with her husband, Jim Freed.
“When I was ready to fall in love for real, I stopped behaving badly, and I met someone great, and great for me. I got better and my taste got better. My fiancé is smart and handsome and talented and decent. Everything about him is my favorite thing about him,” Wurtzel wrote.
“She didn't have her own children but she was a friend of her friends' children,” Brzezinski said. “She was a fearsome, loyal friend.”
Wurtzel announced she was battling cancer in a 2018 Guardian essay, confessional as ever.
“I am good in a fight. This one goes on for the rest of my life. But I have been fighting with myself in one way or another all along. I am used to it. I can’t think of a time when my mind or my body was not out to get me,” she wrote. “I am at ease with this discomfort.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Forward — a student and alumni group working to bring attention to climate change within Harvard’s governance boards — released a policy platform calling for Harvard to divest from the fossil fuel industry and create more guidelines for “responsible investing” earlier this week.
The platform calls for “complete and swift divestment from fossil fuels,” “more transparent and robust processes for developing investment guidelines,” and “increased support for climate-focused initiatives, research, and education.”
“Divestment is the correct decision both morally and financially,” Harvard Forward wrote in the policy platform. “Climate change is a threat to everyone, but we must ​recognize that it disproportionately affects low-income communities, communities of color, women, and the Global South.”
Harvard Forward’s campaign comes as calls for fossil fuel divestment activism have become amplified at Harvard, most recently culminating in a halftime protest that delayed the Harvard-Yale football game in November. Police arrested fifty people at the Game, including 11 Harvard students and alumni and at least 19 Yale students and alumni.
In addition to divestment, Harvard Forward supported further climate change research in their platform.
“Only by pairing divestment with increased support for climate-focused initiatives, research, and education can we develop a University-wide climate action plan that fully utilizes our strengths and maximizes our impact,” it wrote.
The campaign also calls for the establishment of more “transparent and robust” processes without conflicts of interest. In the platform, they propose establishing a Stakeholder Responsibility Committee of the Board of Overseers in lieu of the current Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility.
The Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility — comprised of four alumni, four faculty members, and four students — and the Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility, which can accept or reject the advisory committee’s recommendations, vote annually on a series of proposals to companies of which the University is a shareholder in order to communicate its interests.
In its policy platform, Harvard Forward took issue with this structure, citing connections members of the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — have with the fossil fuel industry.
“The main issue with its present configuration is that the ACSR reports directly to the Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility (CCSR), which is comprised entirely of Corporation Fellows – many of whom have direct ties to the fossil fuel industry,” Harvard Forward wrote. “As such, the ACSR is limited in its effectiveness to ensure adherence to the guidelines it proposes.”
Corporation member Theodore V. Wells recused himself from any Corporation deliberations or votes related to fossil fuel divestment when he became counsel for oil and gas company ExxonMobil in climate change litigation. Other members of the Corporation have also maintained financial and professional ties through their employment or company investments.
Harvard Forward proposed that the Stakeholder Responsibility Committee replace the Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility. The new committee would be made up of at least five elected members of the Board of Overseers, and at least one member would be an Overseer who graduated from Harvard within the last four years.
In response to Harvard Forward’s policy platform, Harvard Spokesperson Jason A. Newton reiterated the University’s previous stance on divestment and pointed to the Climate Action Plan — the school’s plan to become fossil fuel free by 2050 and fossil fuel neutral by 2026.
“While we agree on the urgency of this global challenge, we respectfully disagree with divestment activists on the means by which a university should confront it,” Newton wrote. “Universities like Harvard have a crucial role to play in tackling climate change and Harvard is fully committed to leadership in this area through research, education, community engagement, dramatically reducing its own carbon footprint, and using our campus as a test bed for piloting and proving solutions.”
In a September column for Harvard Magazine, University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote that debate over investment policy will continue.
“While I, like my predecessors, believe that engaging with industry to confront the challenge of climate change is ultimately a sounder and more effective approach for our university, I respect the views of those who think otherwise,” Bacow wrote. “We may differ on means. But I believe we seek the same ends — a decarbonized future in which life on Earth can flourish for ages to come."

NEW YORK — Saturday night, in one of the most storied arenas in American sports, the Harvard men’s hockey team might have nabbed the turning-point win it needed.
The No. 18 Crimson (8-5-2, 6-3-1 ECAC) took on Yale (6-9-0, 5-6-0) at Madison Square Garden, hoping to use a rivalry matchup in a high-profile building to reinvigorate a season that began with six straight victories before a slight setback period. For the moment, Harvard did just that.
The group posted a shutout victory over the Bulldogs in its second consecutive triumph in the Big Apple, following up a 4-1 defeat of Cornell in November 2018. Offensive contributions throughout the lineup, not to mention a 27-save clean sheet from freshman goaltender Mitchell Gibson, fueled the 7-0 win.
“We’ve had some really good first periods over the last few games, but we really haven’t put a full game together, and I thought we did that today,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “As a young team, sometimes we’re our own worst enemy, but tonight I thought we did a nice job…. Very quietly, Mitch Gibson made a handful of saves that didn’t allow them to get back in the game.”
With Harvard already ahead, 3-0, early in the third period, sophomore forward Jack Drury received a pass in stride following a neutral-zone recovery. The centerman strode down the right side of the ice and fired a high shot past the glove of Yale goaltender Corbin Kaczperski (7 GA, .821 SV%).
The snipe was the second goal in Drury’s eventual hat trick, which he completed eight minutes later. From the time of the sophomore’s second mark, however, the game grew out of hand, resulting in multiple “garbage-time” goals to exaggerate the margin.
Before the second frame was two minutes old, the Crimson began padding the lead it established in the opening stanza. Captain Nathan Krusko stopped hard behind the net, letting Yale senior defenseman Billy Sweezey slide past him. Effectively unguarded, Krusko took the puck around the goal-mouth and forced it through Kaczperski’s pads.
While the Harvard letter-wearer has assumed a bottom-six role this season in favor of talented underclassmen, his contributions on the ice were felt strongly on Saturday night, much to the delight of his teammates.
“It’s good to see your captain get one, and that does get the guys fired up,” Drury said. “But I think we expect it, and we know he’s going to score.”
Krusko’s second-frame strike headlined a productive night from the Crimson’s bottom-six forwards to compliment the dominance of the top trio. Junior winger Jack Donato followed his captain’s tuck with one of his own, burying a cross-ice feed from linemate Baker Shore to extend his team’s advantage to three scores. In total, the bottom two forward pairings amassed two goals and three assists in Saturday’s affair.
“[The bottom six is] always a huge part of our team,” Drury lauded. “You look at consistency — playing the right way — they always do a great job of that. The way they cycle the puck and hem teams in helps [the top line] out a lot…. Our forward depth and our depth all around is a huge strength of ours, and we really like to use it.”
Of course, the production surrounding Drury’s hat trick stands out most. Freshman Nick Abruzzese finished with two helpers, and his opposite wing, sophomore Casey Dornbach, potted a goal of his own while adding an assist.
This dynamic top line — one of the more threatening in the ECAC — is responsible for blowing the game open in the third period. Harvard’s fifth and sixth goals both came from the sticks of the team’s first-line forwards. And just eight seconds after Drury solidified his hat trick, sophomore forward R.J. Murphy, making his return from a seven-game injury absence, cashed in on a Kaczperski turnover to pour salt in the Bulldogs’ collective wound.
The senior net-minder finally succumbed to his frustration, having ceded all seven of the Crimson’s scores. With under two minutes remaining in the tilt, Kaczperski incurred a game misconduct penalty for pouncing on Harvard freshman defenseman Henry Thrun, who had made contact with the backstop after a play in his crease.
Tempers flared during the ensuing brawl, providing the chippiness which fans have grown accustomed to seeing from Harvard-Yale matchups.
Despite what the final score may indicate, the bout did not include prolific offensive action for all 60 minutes. In fact, the teams took several minutes to settle into the famous barn in a sort of feeling-out process. Harvard finally broke open the scoring at the 13-minute mark of the first period.
Just 15 seconds into the group’s first powerplay opportunity of the evening, Drury redirected home a feed from Abruzzese, who zipped a hard pass goalward from the corner. Drury, waiting at the net-mouth with his stick on the ice, beat Kaczperski under the pads.
“I thought their goaltender was tremendous in the first to keep the score at 1-0,” said coach Donato, crediting Kaczperski for his early performance to contain all but one of Harvard’s 18 opening-period shots. “All around, I just thought it was a good effort and a great experience for our guys.”
Drury’s first tally of the evening meant that he has now inked the scoresheet in both Madison Square Garden showdowns in which he has partaken. The two-way center, whose four points led all skaters on Saturday, pocketed an assist in last season’s victory over rival Cornell.
Incidentally, that triumph over the Big Red was the first step in establishing the winning identity of the 2018-2019 Crimson; it set the team on a successful path after a turbulent stretch of play to start the campaign. This year’s iteration of the Harvard icemen hopes that a decisive trouncing of another Ivy League rival will have a similar effect.
With several road trips to Upstate New York, the Beanpot Tournament, and the remainder of the conference schedule ahead, that much remains to be seen.
