After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the United States prepares to go to war for the third time in 10 years, it is painstakingly clear that a collective amnesia has set in in Washington. While it is a sad fact that the lessons of history rarely survive a generation, it now seems that history’s teachings are not even remembered by the very leaders who originally learned them. For the benefit of our forgetful friends in Washington, I will recap the recent chronicles of American misadventures abroad, examining helpful parallels to elucidate the comparison.
In Iraq, after deposing Saddam Hussein, the United States simply had no support base, leaving the door open for a sectarian bloodbath that we were helpless to prevent. In Libya (which was hailed as a success after the intervention), the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi has led to the rise of Islamist militias, one of which stormed the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi and murdered four Americans last year. This raises the question—who would fill the vacuum in Syria should we cripple or even topple the Assad regime?
The Free Syrian Army, a moderate, secular rebel group relatively palatable to the West, has received the bulk of American attention and support. However, the FSA is most likely a minority among the rebel forces. The Syrian Liberation Front and the Syrian Islamic Front, both Islamist groups, have grown in strength. Worst of all, the al-Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda affiliate that has been aggressively fighting the Assad regime, welcomes foreign jihadists by the day. Toppling Assad would open a power vacuum in which such extremists would flourish.
Another point our leaders seem to have forgotten is that war—which is by nature messy, brutal, and chaotic—has a way of expanding beyond the bounds of rhetoric. It was Obama’s initial statement that the use of chemical weapons constituted a “red line” that has forced his hand in planning an American response. Since then, the Obama administration has carefully avoided calling a strike a “humanitarian” intervention, lest it drag the United States deeper into Obama’s rhetorical quagmire. According to officials, this is strictly a “limited military strike” to enforce international norms about how not to kill people in war.
Let’s not forget the initial aim of the invasion of Iraq—to prevent Saddam Hussein from using weapons of mass destruction. Yet the war became a 10-year struggle to prop up a fragile democracy with little popular support against Islamist extremists who had nothing to do with Hussein’s weapons program. Even the Libya intervention, which had the clear, limited objective of preventing civilian casualties, has produced a myriad of unforeseen complications, the worst of which was the Benghazi massacre.
Finally, the lack of international support does not bode well for any intervention. With Russia and its veto power sitting on the UN Security Council, there is no chance of a UN mandate. French President François Hollande has been quietly backing away from his once-bellicose rhetoric. Even Britain, America’s erstwhile “special” partner, has voted to sit this one out.
In the invasion of Iraq, which was excoriated by internationalists as a unilateral intervention, we at least had British support. Former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, architect of America’s war in Vietnam, said it best: When asked to reflect on the decision to enter Vietnam alone, McNamara confessed, “None of our allies supported us. Not Japan, not Germany, not Britain or France. If we can't persuade nations with comparable values of the merit of our cause, we'd better re-examine our reasoning.”
As the news media drums for battle and Washington works itself into a war frenzy, it must be difficult for the president and Congress to remember the lessons of the past. But so far, this has only been a war of words, of “red lines” and “international norms,” “heinous crimes” and “unconscionable” violence. Let it end that way, before bombs are dropped and the United States finds itself mired in yet another foreign war.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eighteen months.
Eighteen months passed between the presidential authorization of a strike on an American citizen without judicial approval and the public admission of the massive civil rights violation. The act: an administration-sanctioned drone killing of Anwar al-Awlaki and his son that, two weeks ago, rose back to national consciousness when a federal judge began to question the legality of President Obama’s extrajudicial executions. The case illuminates the perils of drone warfare, which epitomizes the complicated moral calculus that America has faced since Iraqi rebel retaliation, has prompted decentralized warfare across the Middle East.
Drones were first used near the turn of the century for reconnaissance both in Desert Storm and Kosovo. In 2002, the government had 167 drones that it used for intelligence on state enemies—in particular, Saddam Hussein. The unmanned aerial vehicles offer many benefits to commanders. Not only do they remove soldiers from the field of combat, but they also allow the military to strategically deploy resources without worries of being stretched as thin. At the time of its invention, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said that it, along with quickly developing cyber warfare, would revolutionize the way combat was fought in the 21st century.
Across the Middle East—Afghanistan, Iraq, etc.—American military forces have utilized guerilla warfare tactics on their enemies, fighting in a region where friends and foes are not easily distinguishable. Nationless terrorist groups aren’t contained by geographic boundaries and cannot be overcome by invasion. Additionally, unfamiliarity with a hostile region further complicates the difficult situation soldiers face abroad.
Enter drones.
The drone program has increased almost 40-fold since being first used in the “war on terror” by Bush in Pakistan. Since the count in 2002, the program has expanded to 7,500 drones in 2010, with the CIA—an intelligence agency with no combat fleet—acquiring 35 of their own.
The growing motivation behind all of this? To keep America safe from those who would threaten her citizens without risking the lives of her residents: in short, preventing another 9/11 while keeping soldiers safely at home. The burden for this, the responsibility for the safety of a nation, rests squarely on the shoulders of the commander-in-chief, the country’s political and military leader. Having the onus of protecting a nation of 300 million is a unique curse, however, and Bush and Obama have taken it upon themselves to fulfill this sacred duty by whatever means necessary.
The libertarian argument against drones is easy to understand. It’s easy to see the expansion of the drone program in the eyes of libertarians. Columnists Glenn Greenwald and Conor Friedersdorf contend that the extrajudicial killings amount to a metaphorical middle finger to the Fifth Amendment and the guarantees of due process and a right to life that it guarantees. Taking the lives of innocents—which drone strikes do with regularity—without soliciting the opinion from an independent judiciary is easily immoral. Circuiting the War Powers Act by using combat devices without officially declaring war short-circuits the separation of powers process and allows the executive branch to claim previously unexplored powers. Abroad, the killing of innocents helps to create anti-American sentiment in popular drone locations like Yemen, where Friedersdorf argues that the strikes serve as an inadvertent al-Qaeda recruiting tool.
By no means can I sanction the extrajudicial killings that our presidents have launched, but their position—which must be explored in an age of increasingly decentralized warfare—involves a unique set of moral obligations. Friedersdorf’s concerns about liberty and the deaths of innocents abroad presumes that every life abroad is viewed the same as an American one. This idea isn’t reconcilable with the role presidents have in protecting the safety of the nation. Commanders-in-chief weigh the lives of American citizens differently and cannot ignore threats on the health of their constituency, no matter how tenuous. Drone strikes offer an easy reconciliation of the problem for presidents, with American lives saved at home and American interests protected abroad. Is this right? No. Is it convenient? Yes.
Under conventional morality, there are a host of problems with drones. The actions of the past two administrations have licensed a president to be judge, jury, and executioner. By many accounts, Anwar al-Awlaki was not the al-Qaeda operative he was suspected to be—although he had connections to the Fort Hood shootings, malicious intent has not yet been proven. His innocent son perished in the bombings, his life snuffed out without a trial or even a defense.
However, the responsibilities of the president involve a very different moral calculus. A commander-in-chief has his first, second, and third obligations to the people who elected him to protect them. One cannot tackle this problem without acknowledging the president’s dual role as the military’s leader; presidents are in charge of the nation’s safety as much as they are the economy.
Drones are only the beginning in an army of technological advances (cyber warfare, nanorobots, etc.) that will enable a president to keep America safe with soldiers safely at home. Already drones have been involved in the pursuit and assassination of Osama bin Laden, with cyber warfare used to retard Iranian efforts to develop nuclear technology. They are a symbol of expanded executive power but more than that, of a unique set of logic. Obama must weigh every innocent life taken in a drone strike against those of soldiers he has taken out of the danger zone. He is responsible for the safety of 300 million persons, not seven billion. The expansion of the self-preservation instinct isn’t moral in conventional terms, but for a man whose elected duty it is to protect his country, operating by whatever means necessary has become part of the job description.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ice cream, from the lowliest Good Humor novelty to the fanciest gelato, is my favorite thing about summer. This year, I spent a fair amount of time standing in line at Ben & Jerry’s, Mister Softee, and those multiplying frozen yogurt stores, deciding what to get.
Judging by the rate at which these lines move, I’m not the only who takes the decision very seriously. After all, the opportunity cost of a Choco-Taco is a Chipwich. And although sprinkles on top of soft-serve are a textural marvel, they make it impossible to have the cone dipped. Unless you’re with someone who doesn’t mind eating the awful bubblegum flavor you ordered, there is no recourse for a reckless choice.
In 2011, around 1.5 billion gallons of ice cream and frozen dairy products were produced in the United States. Ice cream, to most Americans, is very important, so people evaluate their options carefully.
As the New York City mayoral election—the first of its kind that I’ll be able to vote in—draws nearer, I know what to look for in a frozen dessert. But what should I look for in the leader of a remarkably diverse, heavily bureaucratic, and highly complex city of eight million?
Political puzzles like this one are harder to solve. Questions of morality are often abstract; questions of practicality, in light of economic and institutional concerns, are complicated.
One of the main ingredients in ice cream is air—is a central ingredient in voters hot air? Although the wonkish and idealistic among us might like to believe otherwise, most electoral decisions are not the result of dispassionate reasoning based on concrete facts.
Robert Jervis, professor of international affairs at Columbia University, writes: “Just like the drunk who looked for his keys not where he dropped them, but under the lamppost where the light was better, people often seek inadequate information that is readily available, use misleading measures because they are simple, and employ methods of calculation whose main virtue is ease.”
Whereas we’ll put time and effort into figuring out what “stracciatella” and “gianduia” mean (and, if they have those little spoons, trying samples), we’re less diligent when making political decisions. Because the question of who will govern best is murky, we often avoid asking it outright.
Usually, we substitute an easier question: Which candidate will do something for me? Or, which candidate belongs to the right party? If chocolate’s never let you down before, why experiment with butter pecan?
 
But we sometimes ignore hard political questions altogether. According to the research of Stanford professor John A. Krosnick, candidates whose names appear highest on the ballot receive a boost of about two percentage points. A 2005 Princeton study found that “inferences of competence based solely on facial appearance” (based on viewings that lasted for only one second) could be used to predict the winners of U.S. congressional races about 70 percent of the time.
Statistics like these don’t inspire confidence. They’re in line with Winston Churchill’s famous comment: “The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter.”
But I want to believe, as Churchill observed more optimistically, that “democracy is the worst form of government, except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.” I can’t help but think that if we spent half as much time thinking about candidates as we do about ice cream, the quality of our leaders would improve.
And so—what if we looked at the candidates to succeed Michael Bloomberg the way we look at ice cream?
Of the Democrats, disgraced former Congressman Anthony D. Weiner would be bubblegum. Former Comptroller Bill Thompson would be a cherry Italian ice: reasonable, really, but unexciting. Christine C. Quinn, City Council Speaker, would arguably be Serendipity 3’s famous $1000 sundae running for a fourth term. And liberal frontrunner, Public Advocate Bill de Blasio—a Red Sox fan, raised in Cambridge—would be BerryLine.
I hope voters will consider the GOP candidate likeliest to challenge him, former NYC deputy mayor, budget director, and Metropolitan Transit Authority chairman Joe J. Lhota HBS ’80. Lhota, a proven manager who also favors policies like same-sex marriage and marijuana legalization, would be bacon ice cream—a step outside of traditionally Democratic New York’s comfort zone, maybe, but an excellent choice in the end.
The primary elections are September 10 and the general election November 5. Autumn is approaching—soon the ice cream trucks will disappear. But I hope, for the sake of democracy in my hometown, that it won’t be too late to make a choice we won’t regret.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a week of beating the war drums, President Obama reversed course on Saturday and announced that he would seek congressional authorization for military action in Syria. The attack, which the administration has suggested to be a few days of missile strikes from American ships in the Mediterranean Sea, would come as retribution to Syria’s tyrannical president, Bashar al-Assad, who has been massacring thousands of civilians with impunity but ran afoul of the U.S. “red line” that use of chemical weapons would draw intervention.
In an uncomfortably reoccurring scene, America is prepared to rush into the powder keg Middle East with unclear justification and little certainty of the outcome.
The thorniest issue with Obama’s planned strike is the decidedly vague objective. While the gruesome images from Damascus are appalling, the administration is not seeking a humanitarian intervention. It is not seeking a regime change. And it is not seeking a strike strong enough to change the tide of the war.
What exactly is the United States hoping to accomplish?
President Obama said we must punish the Syrian government for “violating well-establish international norms of chemical weapons,” though the legal justification for such an intervention remains unclear. The necessary United Nations Security Council authorization is sure to fail from vetoes by Russia and China.
Instead, it seems that the United States feels obligated to take some sort of action—no matter how inconsequential—as a face-saving measure. Obama blundered in issuing the red line ultimatum, and Assad is calling America on its bluff.
But America’s military might will remain credible to the world no matter what one dictator thinks of it. And the dangers of our half-hearted limp toward war far outweigh the possible benefits.
At best, the cruise missile strikes will admonish Assad for using further weapons of mass destruction against civilians—so that he can go back to massacring them with conventional bullets, cluster bombs, and airstrikes. At worst, the minimal intervention would make American complicit in a sectarian war that spills to Syria’s neighbors—an Iraq-like quagmire many times over.
The Syrian government and anti-American groups could also manipulate the strikes as rich fodder for propaganda.
President Obama’s decision to seek congressional authorization for the strike, as constitutionally required, was correct. But Congress is elected to speak for the people— the vast majority of whom oppose intervention.
A war-weary America does not need another intervention. In an unexpected embarrassment for the Obama administration, British Prime Minister David Cameron backed out of plans to strike Syria after the House of Commons rejected a preliminary motion. The president should similarly stand down if Congress rejects military action.
Less than two years have passed since America withdrew from the Iraqi disaster. There’s no reason to relive that experience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard students traversed the Yard and surrounding areas for the first day of fall classes, both first-time shoppers and upperclassmen encountered a number of class scheduling and enrollment issues over the course of the day.
Tuesday morning, the popular course selection website courses.cs50.net was plagued by technical difficulties, making it hard for many students to access class locations and meeting times. The website, designed and maintained by the staff of Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I,” allows users to peruse the course catalog, explore classes viewed by friends, and plan out their shopping period schedule.
“We indeed received a few reports of issues this morning, whereby students were able to access CS50 Courses via 3G on phones but not via Wi-Fi on campus, which was consistent with what others were experiencing with some other sites,” wrote CS50 professor David J. Malan ’99 in an email to The Crimson.
Malan said the problem was due to trouble with Harvard’s network, not with the CS50 website itself. The issue also affected the Extension School website, the Harvard Art Museums website, and the HUIT website, among others.
Students and professors alike also noted overcrowding in many classrooms—a common phenomenon during the first days of each semester. This year, crammed into the seats and stairways of popular courses such as Science of the Physical Universe 27: “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science” and Economics 1010a: “Microeconomic Theory.”
Professors partially attributed the problem to significant discrepancies between the number of students who had shown interest in their classes via the spring Pre-Term Planning tool and the actual number of students who showed up.
According to Kennedy School professor Roger B. Porter, who teaches Government 1540: “The American Presidency,” “the number of students who attended class...substantially exceeded the number who registered for the course in the pre-term planning last spring.”
Education professor Katherine K. Merseth told The Crimson in an email that 240 students—double the PTP estimate—showed up to her class United States in the World 35: “Dilemmas of Equity and Excellence in American K-12 Education.” As in past years, Merseth said she will enroll students via a lottery, a measure she believes is necessary to keep discussions fruitful and to form personal connections with her students. Merseth will also teach the course again in the spring to accommodate demand.
Other professors reported numbers consistent with PTP estimates but still significantly higher than in previous years. According to applied mathematics professor Michael P. Brenner, approximately 400 students attended SPU 27 yesterday, 100 more than last year. Brenner said that he and co-professor David A. Weitz will increase the cap on enrollment from 300 to 350.
Brenner, along with other professors, expressed surprise at the high turnout. Though delighted by the interest in their courses, they noted that measures would have to be taken to reduce overcrowding.

Three Harvard teams will take the field this fall with new head coaches on the sidelines, after the Harvard athletics department dealt with significant turnover during the summer by both promoting from within and hiring from afar.
The men’s heavyweight crew team underwent the most significant change, beginning the season without longtime coach Harry Parker. Parker, who led the team for 52 years,  passed away over the summer.
Charley Butt, the former coach of men’s lightweight crew, will replace Parker. Butt will become only the ninth coach in the history of Harvard heavyweight crew, which was established in 1852 with the first ever athletic contest between Harvard and Yale.
Butt has worked with Harvard as the coach of the lightweight crew team for the last 28 seasons, leading the team to nine national championships, including the last two. The team has had dual meet winning records in 25 seasons over the same time frame.
Butt also served as a United States Olympic coach four times and coached Michelle Guerette ’02 to a silver medal in the women’s single sculls in the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The men’s lightweight crew coaching position vacated by Butt has yet to be filled.
The athletic department also hired from within for the men’s swimming head coach, choosing former assistant coach Kevin Tyrrell to lead the squad after the team’s coach of 15 years, Tim Murphy, left to take the same position at Penn State. Before serving as the team’s assistant coach, Tyrrell was the head coach of the U.S. Virgin Islands national men’s and women’s teams from 2005-2009.
Harvard stayed within Cambridge city limits to fill Tyrrell’s old position, tapping former Massachusetts Institute of Technology coach Samantha Pitter to replace him as assistant coach. Pitter served as an assistant coach for the Engineers for four seasons and spent her fifth as head coach while incumbent Dawn Dill was on maternity leave, leading the team to a best-ever NCAA finish.
By contrast, the new men’s soccer coach, Pieter Lehrer, was hired from California. Lehrer, a former associate head coach at the University of California, Berkeley, was hired in April after a three-month search. During Lehrer’s time at Cal, the team capturing three Pac-12 titles and reached the NCAA tournament five times—something that the Crimson have not accomplished since winning the Ivy League championship in 2009. Lehrer will replace Carl Junot, who resigned following a 3-11-3 (0-6-1 Ivy League) season in January.
Lehrer will have an entirely new staff to work with in 2013. Over the summer, the team hired three new assistant coaches—Jonathan Delano, Darren Murray, and A.J. Soares. Drew Chrostek, the new Director of Men’s Soccer Operations, was also hired from Northeastern—where he was a graduate assistant—over the summer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Charles D. Baker ’79, a Massachusetts politician and businessman and the Republican gubernatorial nominee four years ago, will announce Wednesday that he plans to run for governor of Massachusetts next year, the Boston Globe reported Tuesday.
Baker, former CEO of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, ran an unsuccessful campaign against Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 four years ago, losing by a margin of 6.4 percent.
After former Massachusetts senator Scott Brown refused to enter the gubernatorial race in late August, Baker emerged as the likely Republican contender for the nomination. Baker, like Brown, has been described as fiscally conservative but socially liberal, an ideological combination more reflective of the traditionally Democratic-leaning state’s preferences.
“Charlie Baker knows that if he were to run a race that would mimic that national Republican Party, he would lose,” Democratic political consultant Dan Payne said. “He has to look and sound moderate to attract the votes of conservative Democrats and moderates.”
Baker’s progressive stances on social issues have drawn supporters among moderate voters, although Payne has also noted that Baker has avoided controversial topics that might force him to take conservative stances unpopular among many Massachusetts voters.
“He has not been outspoken on issues that Republicans have been losing on, like abortion and same-sex marriage or even the death penalty,” Payne said.
Baker’s ability to straddle the divide between fiscally conservative and socially liberal issues has placed him atop pundits' lists of possible Republican nominees for the race.
“Ever since the last time he ran for governor, the assumption has been that he will run again,” Payne said. “His efforts to get into the race will come as no surprise to Republicans or Democrats.”
Payne suspects that no other candidates will challenge Baker in the Republican primary.
The last gubernatorial race focused on the issues of employment and the economy. Baker pledged to prevent tax hikes and lambasted incumbent Patrick for lackluster attempts to jump start the stagnating economy. However, facing competition from a moderate independent candidate in the race, Baker was forced to adopt more stringent right-leaning views, a mistake that, according to Payne, Baker is unlikely to make again.
Additionally, the choice to declare his candidacy over a year before the election should give Baker more time to line his campaign coffers, making him an even more competitive opponent against the Democrats.
“Baker will be hard to beat,” Payne said.
Should he enter the race, Baker would join a crowded field that already includes three Harvard graduates vying for the governorship. Steven Grossman (HBS ’69), Donald M. Berwick ’68, a health care policy lecturer at Harvard Medical School, and Juliette N. Kayyem ’91, a lecturer in public policy at Harvard Kennedy School, have already announced their intention to run next fall.
Patrick, also a Harvard graduate, is eligible to run  for reelection but has stated that he will not seek a third term.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Part II of a four-part series on Harvard’s incoming Class of 2017, based on data collected by The Crimson in an online survey conducted in the month of August. Part I ran on Tuesday, Part III ran on Thursday, and Part IV will run on Friday.
In Harvard Yard, 14 percent are the 1 percent. In a Crimson survey of the Class of 2017, about 14 percent of incoming freshmen said they come from families with reported incomes above $500,000 a year, putting them among the top roughly 1 percent of earners in the United States.
More than half of Harvard freshmen reported coming from households that make more than $125,000 a year. In comparison, the median household income in America is just over $50,000, according to recent U.S. Census data.
This year Harvard reported that it will spend $182 million on undergraduate financial aid. But even given need blind admissions and Harvard’s expansive financial aid program, survey results suggest that Harvard freshmen still disproportionately represent America’s economic elite.
The Crimson conducted its email survey of the freshman class from Aug. 5 to Aug. 28. A total of 1,311 incoming students responded—nearly 80 percent of the Class of 2017—although not all of them finished the survey. Part II of a four-part series on the survey’s results looks at statistics related to admissions, financial aid, and athletic recruiting.
ADMISSIONS BY THE NUMBERS
Eighty-one percent of freshman respondents said they are at their first choice college. On average, freshmen applied to 6.57 schools, and were accepted to 4.68.
Two students reported applying to a class-high 25 schools. The highest number of reported acceptances was 24.
Overall, about 50 percent of respondents said that they were accepted to Harvard early, in line with statistics released by the College.
On average, freshman respondents took the SAT 1.85 times, earning an average highest composite score of 2237. Students were more likely to take the SAT, and most respondents never took the ACT.
Standardized test scores varied along racial lines. East Asian and Indian respondents reported SAT averages of 2299, the two highest of the seven ethnic groups considered in the survey. Respondents who identified as Black and Native American reported the lowest average scores, 2107 and 2142, respectively.
Respondents’ highest SAT scores tended to go up with an increase in income bracket. Of the six income brackets represented in the survey, respondents who reported household incomes of more than $500,000 or between $250,000 and $500,000 earned the highest average SAT composite scores.
INCOME AND ADMISSIONS
When Harvard announced that it would eliminate early action in 2007, then-President Derek C. Bok argued that early action programs “advantage the advantaged.” With the program now reinstated, the numbers suggest that this concern could still be justified.
Respondents from the two highest income categories were more likely to say they had been admitted early. Meanwhile, respondents from the two lowest income categories were underrepresented among early action admits.
In the top income bracket, the 14 percent of surveyed freshmen who reported that their parents earn more than $500,000 constituted 18 percent of early admits.
Within the lowest bracket, freshmen who said their families earned less than $40,000 per year comprised 15 percent of the overall number of respondents but represented only 9 percent of respondents who identified themselves as early action admits.
It is unclear whether this disparity is a result of low-income applicants’ limited access to college counseling and other admissions resources. Other factors may contribute to the underrepresentation of low-income applicants in the early admit pool.
FINANCIAL AID
The survey results reflected the College’s wide-reaching financial aid program. Nearly 60 percent of respondents reported that they will receive financial aid from the University, a number that is in line with the College’s reports.
Of respondents whose parents earned less than $80,000, 97 percent said that they would receive aid from Harvard. The survey suggested that the majority of the Class of 2017 in the $125,000 to $250,000 income bracket also receive assistance from the University.
The proportion of respondents on financial aid varied widely by geographic region and school type.
Eighty-six percent of freshmen who said that they are from a rural community reported that they would receive financial aid. In contrast, only 54 percent of urbanites and 56 percent of suburbanites said that they would receive financial aid.
Public and charter school respondents reported the highest proportions of freshmen on financial aid by secondary school type. Seventy percent of public school respondents and 68 percent of charter school respondents said that they would receive financial aid. Thirty-four percent of respondents from non-denominational private schools and 53 percent of respondents from parochial schools also said that they would receive assistance from the University.
Respondents who will receive Harvard financial aid reported slightly lower standardized test scores than respondents who will not receive aid. Surveyed financial aid recipients posted an average SAT composite score of 2209. Respondents who will not receive college-based financial aid reported an average SAT composite score of 2275.
SPORTS AND ADMISSIONS
Recruited athletes navigate through a different admissions process than non-recruited students, a reality reflected in the survey results.
More than 80 percent of surveyed recruited athletes were accepted via early action as opposed to just 46 percent of non-recruited athletes.
Respondents who identified as recruited athletes had an average composite SAT score of 2082, more than 170 points lower than the 2255 average of respondents who were not recruited for a varsity sport.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As members of the Harvard community prepare to celebrate the Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashanah—which begins at sunset Wednesday and restricts all work, including writing—students and professors are working to accommodate those observing the holiday.
Those observing Rosh Hashanah cannot work from sunset on Wednesday to sundown on Thursday or Friday, depending on denomination, which could lead to conflict during classes or events such as the Activities Fair.
Several Jewish professors will not be offering classes during the period of Rosh Hashanah, while many students will miss classes to attend services.
“It’s very unfortunate, but there is not anything else [the University] can do,” said Jon L. Ascherman ’16, Vice President for Community Relations and Social Justice at Hillel. “But I think the College is really accommodating right now.”
Many professors still holding classes, for example, plan to utilize office hours and offer notes for students who cannot attend class during the holiday. Students observing the holiday will not be penalized for work missed during shopping week, wrote Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Colin Manning in an email statement to The Crimson.
David F. Sackstein ’14, president of the Hillel Undergraduate Steering Committee, said that most of the outreach to support students observing the holiday has involved emailing deans and House masters and communicating with student organization leaders. Hillel has made various efforts to support the Jewish community during the week, he added, and has been especially attentive to incoming Jewish students who may not know what resources are available to them. To help students take part in the Activities Fair, Hillel created paper slips on which observing students can write their names before the holidays begin. Students will submit these slips to organizations instead of signing a list.
Some Jewish students noted the difficulties of dealing with the holiday in the middle of shopping week. “Harvard did make scheduling a frustration that could have been avoided with the Activties Fair,” Talia Weisberg ’17 said. “It could have been scheduled any other time, but it’s on Rosh Hashanah.”
Sackstein acknowledged that the timing creates a “difficult situation,” but was optimistic about the services in place for the community. “There are ways to make the best of it,” he said.

CORRECTION: September 16, 2013
An earlier version of this article misquoted Jon L. Ascherman ’16 as saying he thought it was “very unfortunate that there is not anything else” Harvard could do about the conflict between shopping week and the Jewish holiday Rosh Hashanah. In fact, Ascherman said he believed it was “very unfortunate, but there is not anything else” Harvard could do about the conflict.
