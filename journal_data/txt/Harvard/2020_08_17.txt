After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In one of the opening shots of “Miss Americana,” the recent Taylor Swift Netflix documentary, Swift sits criss-cross-apple-sauce on a windowsill surrounded by her diaries. All of them are pink, as are Swift’s nails, as is the sweater under her denim shortalls. Swift picks up a diary — the very first one she recorded, she tells us, at age 13. The cover is full of Swift’s doodles of hearts and her handwriting spelling out in block-letters: “My Life. My Dreams. My Career. My Reality.” Yikes, we think. Someone give that kid a hug. Swift flips through the diaries’ pages. There appear to be hundreds and hundreds of them, the past 17 years of her life not just detailed in the tabloids, but inked out here too.
It is fitting that a documentary about Swifit should begin with her diaries. Over the course of seven albums, Swift continuously wrote from an “I” that was ostensibly her. This “I” was detailed to the point of obsession, definitive to the point of tunnel vision. It was also intimate and immediate. “All Too Well,” a song off her album “Red,” is the best example of this diaristic style: Swift’s repeated assertion — “I was there / I remember it all too well”— is her clinging to testimony, the validity of things as she experienced them. This unadulterated detail was necessary, important: Swift knows how to dig her heels in the ground. She will not be gaslit. But other songs and albums took this diaristic “I” to a near-tyrannical level: “reputation” was all about Swift’s white-knucled attempts to be entirely in control of the narrative surrounding her many celebrity feuds. “The Story of Us” and “Love Story” supplanted the messiness of reality (which, especially this year, feels something like a phantasmagoria) for the tidiness of narrative; they seemed to imply that experiences could be bound in something like a picture book, or perhaps like a diary, and that those pages would be enough.
But now, with the release of her eighth studio album on July 24, Swift abandons storybook pages for something more expansive and harder to pin down. It would be typical for an album like “folklore”— an album that leaves behind the puking rainbow that was “Lover” and the thumped up spectacle of “reputation” in favor of something more subtle, dare I say folk — to be inward-facing, the product of the self-reflection Swift has done in isolation. But “folklore” is more about imagination than introspection. In a statement accompanying the album, Swift wrote, “I found myself not only writing my own stories, but also writing from the perspective of people I’ve never met, people I’ve known, or those I wish I hadn’t.” “Folklore” trades in the diaristic “I” for a more traveling, indecisive and, above all, fair “I.”
We are transported from one story to another on “folklore” over the course of 17 songs, all of which beautifully pair acoustic guitar and piano with the soft synth Swift perfected on “Delicate.” The album feels like a departure for its sheer sparseness. The instrumental notes on each song are few and far between, leaving blank spaces (pun intended) that we would normally expect Swift to fill in with hammering percussion, desperate to show off her ability to craft every millisecond of a song. On “folklore,” these sonic gaps don’t feel like blankness so much as openness, characterized not by lack but by potential. Which is to say, less is more.
Still, the album is rich with narrative complexity. Swift’s greatest innovation on “folklore” is how much of its storylines she braids together. Three of the songs on the album are about the same love triangle between three highschoolers. Each one, however, is sung from a different perspective. In a stroke of literary and marketing genius, Swift connects these lovers with a traveling cardigan. “And when I felt like I was an old cardigan” is, indeed, a beautiful simile, but I suspect Swift also knew she could make bank selling some cardigans, $49 a pop on her website. One of these three songs,“betty,” takes the viewpoint of the cheating jerk at the middle of this mess: James stands on his girlfriend’s doorstep, skateboard in hand, learning how to apologize. “Will you kiss me on the porch in front of all your stupid friends?” he asks. Uhhh, pass.
A radical sense of generosity is sensed when, after listening to the whole album, one considers these songs together, each one like a puzzle piece. Swift has empathy for even the dirtbag skater boy. Everyone is allowed their two cents. Each perspective matters. “Exile,” a collab with Bon Iver, encapsulates this newfound generosity in one song: two sides of a failed relationship with dueling perspectives about what went wrong. “You never gave me a warning sign,” Bon Iver sings and layered over it is Swift singing “I gave so many signs.” “Folklore” feels like an admission about the limitations of providing one experience alone.
Critics have found many ways to characterize Swift’s development as an artist — the passage from one genre to another, the first time she confessed to drinking alcohol, when she started getting “experimental” — but one development, generally deemed a negative one by critics, has been how her lyric-writing has changed over the years. Her pen used to be sharp as a knife, critics say. She was often seen riding shotgun, her blonde curls wet with rain after dancing in a storm in her best dress. Everything was like a picture. When Swift went pop, this detailed imagery was traded in for less intricate writing full of catchy hooks. It was flimsy and vague.
“Folklore” transforms this flimsy vagueness into a tightlipped reticence. The album is full of beautiful, stark images: Swift is high over Pennsylvania riding a tire swing; the rosé is flowing, she’s drinking it up; there are Rhode Island mansions and old Levi’s, disco balls and yogurt shops. Unlike on previous albums, Swift doesn’t judge these images so much as she absorbs them and then pours them back out. “Invisible string,” about two people who never thought they would end up together, illustrates this reticence perfectly. “Time, curious time / Give me no compasses, give me no signs,” Swift sings over plucked strings. The song enacts its title: Swift strings together disparate anecdotes about a relationship — one of them about an unwitting waitress who tells Taylor Swift that she looks a lot like an American singer named Taylor Swift — but she imposes no definitive narrative on these scenes. Instead, she lets them hang like garments on a clothesline. She has always believed in destiny, but “invisible string” is different — not the sudden and pulse-quickening fate of eyes whispering across a room à la “Enchanted,” but a more realistic fate: the long and winding road of life, sometimes boring, sometimes distressing, always unpredictable. “Isn’t it just so pretty to think / All along there was some / Invisible string / Tying you to me?” she asks. Conclusive narratives, the ones Swift has long favored, are usually unreliable ones. Words are just as likely to obscure the truth as they are to elucidate it. Swift seems to know this now. There is no closure on “folklore;” Swift isn’t rinsing away passion and pain so much as she is allowing those things to dawdle, like bathwater that’s never drained. She still has her knife. She’s just choosing to use the blunt edge of it, not wielding it so much as she is holding it out. Her lyrics on “folklore” don’t cut. They linger.
It will likely be said that “folklore” is Swift “stripped down” (whatever that means), no longer “performing.” But Swift is, at the end of a day, a performer. “Folklore” is no exception: she performs as many different characters on the album. If nothing else, the album makes a strong case for performance. Whereas Swift once believed in a love that comes naturally — a redemptive love, love like a clean slate or a “State of Grace,” something that makes you “Fearless,” sparks flying and wedding objections — she now views love as something more akin to effort, performance. On “mirrorball,” when all of the people have left the party, when it’s just two people alone in a room, Swift says that she is “still on my tallest tiptoes / Spinning in my highest heels, love / Shining just for you.” She compares being alone with this person to being on a tightrope and a trapeze. “I’m still trying everything to get you laughing at me,” she sings, practically panting. “this is me trying” picks up this idea, a song about showing up on someone’s doorway, pouring your heart out to them no matter how hard it is. Even James, that cheating teenage boy again, shows up on a doorway and tries. “The only thing I wanna do / Is make it up to you,” he pleads. And since it is after all Swift who we’re dealing with here, what could be more romantic than this, than people trying for one another?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I would think that we, as faculty members, would remember what was essential in our own academic journeys. Are the educators and leaders at American universities blind to the impact that a closed campus has on students? Is our unexamined comfort in remaining online driving our easy acceptance of a remote semester? 

The virtual college experience is not good enough. Students need an in-the-flesh community to engender the relationships and connections the traditional university is designed to provide.  This is especially crucial for students as they enter and when they leave the university. Their life plans hinge on finding friends and mentors when they begin their college years and cementing those relationships before they exit. It is unrealistic to believe this can be achieved online. The person-to-person connection and commitment is not the same. 

I write from experience. During the first months of the pandemic I taught entirely online “Case Studies in the Lives of Persons” at Harvard Extension School. To be fair, the face-to-face Zoom interaction often felt intimate and satisfying. But here’s the rub: I am fairly certain that if I was walking on campus and passed any of these students, I would not recognize them beyond some uncanny feeling they seem familiar.

Most of my academic load is teaching and supervising doctoral level clinical psychologists. I am also a practicing psychoanalyst. In the past, before I would consider initiating or terminating a therapeutic relationship, I wanted to be physically present. Nonetheless, since the pandemic began, I have begun working online with a few individuals and couples who simply could not wait until we felt safe to meet in person. Online therapy has a different cadence and perspective. The face-to-face immediacy is both challenge and asset. However, as with my online-only students, I fear I would not recognize any of my new patients if we sat at nearby tables in the outdoor cafes now open in Boston.

Here is what I am observing: My academic peers — people at least for now reassured about their means — are sleeping better, feel less hurried, and find comfort in their extended, sheltered-in-place lives. We are enjoying our enforced staycation.

Suddenly freed from physically showing up to class, freed from the demands of students, we are quietly invested in remaining at home, on Zoom, reading what we want, getting caught up on TV, tending our gardens, having our food delivered. We are thriving. Thriving, that is, at the expense of an obligation to our students and those less sheltered. This staycation is a relief for people secure in their social lives, family, and career. For people who are not secure or established, the profound isolation of shutdowns and the extreme uncertainty of what they face in the future provokes responses from ordinary anxiety to scarring trauma. I witness both patterns in my conversations with patients daily.

For those for whom the pandemic has not created desperation, has it actually offered a welcome break? Is whatever guilt we may feel by staying home dampened by our virtuous acceptance of a social distance we don’t really resent?  

We are complicit in intergenerational injustice if we relish the cozy existence we have in our socially-distanced retreats. I would not have thought this weeks ago, but I am discovering conflict with the comfort I have achieved. I say I want the lockdown to be over, but at the same time, I am reluctant to have it end. When the lockdowns started in March, I would have thought I would want them ended as soon as it was clear our hospital systems were no longer in danger of collapse. Months later, I cannot claim my comfort with the closed campus is an ethical concern for the greater good of students; instead, it’s mainly about my comfort.

We all face a pandemic. A terrible disease for some elders, for those with preexisting conditions, and for those whose social conditions along racial, ethnic, and economic lines place them in harm’s way; and also for the medical responder inadequately protected and overwhelmed by a viral load. Nonetheless, ordinarily, the virus is a manageable sickness for most students. There are exceptions that require proper caution, but do the exceptions justify us all to stay at home instead of continuing to educate students properly?

We need careful planning to protect those who are exceptionally vulnerable. We need to be prepared for expected and unexpected tragedy. But this pandemic could last for years. The promise of a working vaccine by the winter may be good for the markets but does not reflect medical reality. Anticipate this. Sequester vulnerable faculty in well-lit, well-ventilated rooms with bright monitors and good headsets. Give us sufficient bandwidth, but let students and willing faculty gather with realistic caution of contagion. A degree of contentment is apparent, but what should be obvious is that this contentment is complicit with the degradation of a generation of future academics.

The pandemic is a prequel of global stress to come. We need a thousand solutions. Those enjoying their comfort should be aware they are part of the problem.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Board of Overseers election reaches its close, leaders of Harvard Forward — a group advocating for climate change reform and young alumni representation on the University’s governance boards — defended their campaign at a town hall Saturday amid increasing concerns from alumni about their mission.
The Zoom town hall followed a letter penned by a group of alumni, which included 10 out of the 13 current members of the Harvard Alumni Association’s Executive Committee, criticizing Harvard Forward’s campaign strategy and policy positions.
At the town hall, Harvard Forward co-founders Danielle O. Strasburger ’18 and Nathán Goldberg Crenier ’18 addressed concerns the alumni raised in the letter about the Overseers’ ability to control the University’s finances and make decisions about divestment.
Crenier said that while the Board of Overseers does not have direct control over the Harvard Management Company, the Overseers do have significant influence over Harvard’s decision-making.
“We know that the Overseers are not the ones that manage the money,” he said. “But the links between the Overseers and the Corporation — dating all the way back to the establishment of the Corporation — are such that the Overseers actually have a lot of influence if they choose to use it.”
Strasburger also pushed back on criticism that their campaign is focused on a “special interest” or a “single platform.” She said the campaign’s slate of candidates have spoken out about important issues that fall outside of the “very narrow purview” of what some consider University business.
“Many of us...see Harvard as being a massive player on the world stage, and therefore, what’s in the best interest of Harvard and the best interest of the world often overlap,” she said.
Alumni also wrote in their letter that Harvard Forward’s “copious funding” and “full-time campaign staff, operating costs, and targeted ads” troubled them.
Strasburger said in the town hall that neither she nor Crenier are paid or compensated for their work.
“It has purely been a labor of much, much, much love,” Strasburger said.
The Harvard Forward website lists several “core team members,” including a field director, brand & technology manager and summer fellows.
In their initial written response to the alumni letter, Strasburger and Crenier wrote that Harvard Forward was a grassroots movement that runs on “hundreds of individual donations” from school affiliates.
While the alumni called Harvard Forward’s campaigning methods “atypical,” Strasburger said they did not break election rules by hosting office hours around the world and advertising their campaign on social media. She also said Crenier reviewed the rules of the election with the Office of the Governing Boards before their campaign launched.
“We were not given a guidebook,” she said. “The only things they’d step in on are about negative campaigning or lying so that was all we had to guide our campaign.”
“At no point have we been told that anything about the campaign that we’re doing is problematic,” she added.
Harvard Forward leaders publicized the town hall as an opportunity for University affiliates to hear from both Harvard Forward and alumni who signed the letter. Only representatives from Harvard Forward made an appearance, as several alumni declined to participate due to time zone concerns and scheduling conflicts.
All Harvard degree holders — expect those in University instruction and governance positions — are eligible to vote in the annual Overseers election. The election ends August 18.

D. One of the $700 chairs in the Yard.
Results:
Mostly A’s: The fully organized Canvas site with one too many informational videos and a detailed calendar laying out the entire semester.
You are more than ready to get back on that school grind. You’ve started browsing for courses the minute the 2020-2021 course catalog was published and know that 3,592 page doc from beginning to end. There are probably seven or eight courses in your Crimson Cart, even though you’re fairly certain of the four courses you will be taking. This is secretly your favorite time of the year and you will not let online courses ruin it.
Mostly B’s: “Warning! This Canvas Course has not been published yet.”
This Canvas site probably describes your life better than you can describe it yourself. You either have absolutely no clue on what courses to take or have at least 10 courses you’re planning to shop and have absolutely no idea which of the 10 to take. Regardless, you have no idea what to do and all your decision-making seems to go in a never-ending spiral. The HarvardKey site going under maintenance isn’t the only difficulty you’re running into.
Mostly C’s: Old syllabus, old lecture slides, old course calendar… 
You’ve been looking at courses to take this fall since Fall 2017. You know exactly which courses are gems, and which courses secretly fulfill the distribution and GenEd requirements. You’ve gone so far back that some of the courses you’ve looked at aren’t even offered anymore. However, you will not put your years of hard work to waste and are determined to construct the chillest schedule. You will not be taking any risks with new classes. Low risk, high reward is the way to go.
Mostly D’s: The Canvas site with only one tab that’s labeled, “Home.”
Can’t find the syllabus for this course? Can’t find the times of this course’s informational sessions during shopping week? Can’t find the zoom link for lectures? You tell yourself that you’re ~slowly~ getting ready for the semester, but you still can’t find the course catalog for this school year. Completely clueless, yet, surprisingly, not worried. Maybe you’re just going with the flow.
