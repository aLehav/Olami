After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On January 4, Sayed Arif Faisal was killed by Cambridge police. A student at the University of Massachusetts Boston, a Bangladeshi American, a 20-year-old only child, Faisal’s death sparked protests from the Cambridge community calling for police accountability. Faisal was very probably undergoing a mental health crisis, and instead of helping him, police fatally shot him.
As a Bangladeshi immigrant myself, I cannot describe the feelings of anger and grief that I felt when hearing this news. My parents, however, clearly articulated theirs: anger at his death, grief for his parents, and lack of trust in the ability of the police to conduct a thorough investigation. In that moment, the myth of immigrant excellence — of coming to America to achieve a better life — vanished, and all that was left behind was the realization that the police will not protect us.
There is an urge, I think, to provide the police with more resources, like body cameras, for the sake of better regulating the system. But bolstering law enforcement does not always keep us safe, for reasons with which we are already all too familiar, although perhaps not well-equipped to see.
For South Asians, the stain of British colonialism has never left; the violence perpetuated and the struggle for independence has left behind a legacy of struggle and division. We understand very well the imprint British colonialism has left in our motherlands, and we are aware of our racialized brown bodies in the airport post 9/11, but too often, we fall short at denouncing the American policing system — another tool of colonial and racist/white supremacist/Islamophobic violence, one that does not guarantee safety and protection like it advertises.
The United States spends more than 100 billion dollars a year on policing, yet some experts argue that there is no relationship between the number of police present in an area and crime rates. It is clear from the disproportionate impacts that police have on Black people that their presence is not always good for the communities they claim to serve.
Many South Asians extend our solidarity with Black Lives Matter by protesting against police brutality and donating to antiracist organizations. However, we often dismiss having discussions of anti-Blackness in our own communities and may believe our efforts are wasted on our parents, who belong to an older generation that can be less socially conscious.
To be sure, having these conversations is necessary to create sustained change. But ultimately, atrocities targeting people and bodies we identify as “our own” create powerful feelings of solidarity. This shared sense of vulnerability opens the door wide open for righteous outrage despite these obstacles, just as it did for my parents.
This may be uncomfortable for many — as it should be. Narratives of Asian American excellence are designed to placate us and ease our assimilation into the white supremacist fabric of this nation. We may be convinced by the outwardly progressive stance of Cambridge’s government, but they refuse to release the names of the officers involved in Faisal’s shooting, and have placed the man who shot him on paid administrative leave rather than taking stronger action. While we may have nominal freedom to conduct as we choose, what does that mean when the police, a tool of colonial violence, can end our lives on a whim?
We should know that we would not be able to live comfortably in this country without the civil rights movement that in many ways fought against police brutality, just as Black Lives Matter does today. Particularly, those of us who come from a privileged caste — meaning that, back home, we wield disproportionate wealth and power, socially, religiously, and politically — must acknowledge the violence that has and will continue to perpetuate towards Black, brown, and low income communities in this country. We can clearly articulate the problems of corruption and violence that exist in our motherlands, but why do we often fail to do so in the United States?
Sayed Faisal should be alive today. If proper mental health and emergency response professionals had been available to answer his call, he would not have been viewed as a threat and had his humanity stripped from him. The city of Cambridge should not be able to quietly hide their officers away on what essentially amounts to paid vacation while the community grieves, and we as South Asians have a responsibility to fight against this country’s police system — not just for Faisal and his family, but for every Black and brown American killed by police brutality.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Our collective lack of sleep shows readily across campus. People nap in chairs, or even on the library floor, to catch much-needed shuteye before they return to the grind. Our culture of poor sleep habits isn’t new, but in recent years, Harvard has come up with some novel solutions to tackle it. In September 2018, for the first time, the College required incoming freshmen to complete an online training module prior to their arrival on campus about sleeping habits and their effects on other areas of life.
In other ways, too, it seems that students are becoming more aware of the importance of sleep. There is even a General Education class on sleep taught by leading researchers. I’ve taken the GenEd and completed all my required training modules, but those haven’t been enough to solve the lack of sleep on campus. I’ve come away convinced that we need better ways to promote sleep for students. Put simply: Harvard needs nap pods.
Nap pods are furniture designed to enable people to sleep comfortably in any place — a corporate office, a hospital lobby, or a library at a university like ours. Not only do nap pods suit our busy schedules well; our schedules demand them. Research suggests that naps, even as short as 20 minutes, may increase energy levels and lower the risk of cardiovascular disease. For most of us, 20 minutes is all we can muster during a busy weekday.
Aren’t there simpler solutions to our sleep woes? In theory, the College could reduce class workload or remove anti-sleep rules in study spaces like the Smith Center. The first of these options, however, is particularly unfeasible; reducing class workload is perhaps the greatest pipe dream of them all. Students are naturally ambitious. Whether it’s classes or clubs, something is always taking up our time. And because we pay the same tuition regardless of how many classes we take,  we are incentivized to bulk up our course load every semester.
Removing anti-sleep rules at Smith or other common spaces is unlikely to be sufficient, either. It would be a step in the right direction (and, in some ways, requisite for introducing nap pods), but students should benefit from the best tools available to help them rest, as with any other educational device. Nap pods offer students a level of privacy that generic couches do not. And because they are intended only for sleeping, in contrast to generic couches, the College could ensure thorough and frequent cleaning between occupants.
Other universities seem to recognize the value in nap pods. Institutions like Stanford University, the University of Miami, Wesleyan University, and Washington State University have installed sleeping pods in libraries and other places around campus.
The University of Akron, in particular, offers a feasible model for integrating nap pods into study spaces. The university set up four nap pods in three different study places, allowing students to use them for 20-minute refresher naps throughout the day. The school seems to have recognized that sleep itself is a crucial aspect of wellbeing, in all senses of the word. Nap pods can be understood as cutting-edge mental health equipment, and providing this equipment to all students, not only select groups like student-athletes, is laudable.
Harvard has a unique opportunity to make investments in its students’ physical and mental wellbeing. Nap pods have shown to facilitate promising improvements to alertness and energy levels for healthcare workers on long shifts, and there’s no reason to suspect that their effect would be anything different at Harvard.
The College should look for nap pod manufacturers with which to partner on a pilot program. It wouldn’t be the first. San Diego nap pod manufacturer HOHM partnered with the University of Ohio Cleveland Medical Center in 2020 to deliver two free sleep stations. Though some university administrators may deem nap pods an inefficient use of money, our student body is small enough, and the university’s coffers large enough, to make our sweet dreams a reality.
Sleep is too crucial to be overshadowed by every other priority in the life of a busy undergraduate. Sleeping inadequately is associated with severe physical and cognitive consequences, a reality that does not spare ambitious students. A 2014 analysis showed that the best independent predictors of injuries among student-athletes in Los Angeles were hours of sleep per night and grades in school, with students averaging less than eight hours of sleep almost twice as likely to suffer an injury as those who averaged eight or more — a sobering fact for the hundreds of student athletes on Harvard’s campus. Other documented effects include decreased attention spans, impaired cognitive development, and an increased propensity towards risky behaviors.
The reality is that students don’t sleep as much as they need to. Instead of hoping the problem will fix itself, it’s time for Harvard to take action to bring students what they need: nap pods.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The search for Harvard’s next dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the University’s largest academic school, launched Tuesday afternoon, FAS Dean and University President-elect Claudine Gay announced in an email to FAS affiliates.
Gay and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 will lead the search, with assistance from a 14-person advisory committee composed of 12 FAS professors, Dean of Harvard Law School John F. Manning ’82, and Harvard Business School professor Tsedal Neeley.
The FAS professors come from all three academic divisions and span more than a dozen academic departments.
Gay said selecting a candidate to succeed her at the helm of Harvard’s biggest school will be one of her “first and most important tasks as president-elect.”
“We hope to benefit from views from across the FAS community and beyond as we seek to identify an outstanding new leader of the FAS,” Gay wrote.
Gay’s email did not provide a timeline for the search or specify to what extent Harvard’s current president, Lawrence S. Bacow, will be involved. Harvard spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on a timeline or Bacow’s involvement.
In recent decades, FAS deans have stepped down at around the same time as the University president. Gay’s search for her successor will be the fourth consecutive time a president-elect or first-year president has appointed a new FAS dean.
In her email, Gay invited FAS faculty, students, and staff to provide insights on the future of the FAS or nominate potential candidates via a survey or a dedicated email for the search.
“We particularly invite your thoughts on the major opportunities and challenges facing the FAS in the coming years, on the professional and personal qualities most important to seek in the next dean, and on any individuals who you believe warrant serious consideration for the deanship,” she wrote.
Selecting her successor at FAS will likely be the most consequential of four appointments Gay is poised to make as she begins her term as president. She will also be tasked with finding a new dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences — for whom a search kicked off last week — and deans of Harvard’s Divinity School and School of Public Health.
The next FAS dean will inherit a slate of initiatives Gay launched during her tenure, including hiring faculty in climate studies and working with Brenda D. Tindal, the newly-appointed FAS campus curator, to assess and update the school’s spaces and signage.
Gay’s successor will also oversee the conclusion of a three-year FAS strategic planning process to assess and provide recommendations for the school’s long-term sustainability and success.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard undergraduates flocked to the Science and Engineering Complex on Tuesday for the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences’ first in-person sophomore convocation since February 2020.
The event, which celebrates undergraduates who declared SEAS concentrations last fall, featured a speech by outgoing SEAS Dean Francis J. Doyle III and concentrators. Inside the complex, tables of SEAS merchandise and food greeted more 100 students who attended the event.
According to Doyle, the school is welcoming its largest-ever class of sophomore concentrators with 502 students.
“Our students at the College are now 24 percent of the entire College,” Doyle said. “If I were to take you back to when the school started 15 years ago, we were about 5, 6, 7 percent of the College.”
Doyle also reiterated the school’s commitment to diversity, inclusion, and belonging initiatives.
“We’re committed to making this an open and welcoming environment,” he said.
For the last two years, the school hosted its sophomore convocation on Zoom because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Prior to 2020, SEAS held the event in the Science Center.
Doyle said he was excited to finally host the celebration in-person in the SEC.
“There’s something about the atrium here and the flow and the sense of congregating that I think is more energizing,” Doyle said.
Leaders of SEAS-affiliated student organizations set up tables inside the main atrium to talk to attendees about club opportunities before and after the speeches.
“We’re working on a number of initiatives at SEAS with our student body, as well as our counseling staff, and some of the work involves partnering with the dynamic student-led organizations,” Doyle said during his speech.
Michael Y. Zhao ’25, co-president of the Harvard Computer Society, said the convocation was a chance for club leaders to share their work with students.
“We got to present and show off what we offer to prospective members,” Zhao said. “It’s a very unique opportunity for us to be able to get so much exposure to different students and overall, I just think it’s a great way to get the SEAS community together.”
Nicholas K. Chebat ’25, a Computer Science and Statistics concentrator, said the convocation allowed him to discover a network of peers in the field.
“I’ve never been so connected to this engineering building,” Nicholas said. “It’s usually just a place for your classes, but now it’s a place for community.”
Nibrass Fathi ’25, a Computer Science concentrator, said the event was a good opportunity to find out more about what “Harvard and SEAS has to offer.”
As the founder of the SEAS sophomore convocation, Doyle discussed the significance of the event returning to an in-person setting.
“I have to say it’s bittersweet,” Doyle said. “I created this event in SEAS for the sophomores as a way to welcome them into the community.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers gathered outside Massachusetts Hall Tuesday to demand the University grant a higher pay raise as Harvard and the union enter month 10 of contract negotiations.
HUCTW’s last contract expired on Sept. 30, 2022. The current negotiations, which started in April 2022, are the longest in the union’s history since 2013.
“It’s been 16 months since our members have had a raise,” HUCTW director Bill Jaeger said. “This is starting to be pretty clearly the most difficult of the 13 rounds of negotiations that we’ve had with the University.”
After negotiating privately since April, HUCTW and the University began meeting through a third-party mediator in November. They have since met 12 times to seek a final agreement.
“It does add some seriousness to the whole situation,” Jaeger said.
Though the previous contract remains in effect, none of the tentative agreements that both sides have already reached can go into effect until disagreements over compensation have been resolved.
“I also feel that we deserve to have raises where we are keeping up with inflation and making financial progression,” SEAS faculty administrator Claudia Stearns said at Tuesday’s protest. “That has always been the standard we have gone by — the union and Harvard. And all of a sudden, Harvard is unwilling to do that, not even to keep up with inflation.”
“In this time, a lot of us are really hurting. A lot of us are really struggling,” added Stearns, who is a member of HUCTW.
In an email to all employees eligible for benefits Tuesday afternoon, Vice President for Human Resources Manuel Cuevas-Trisán wrote that University negotiators are currently offering the union an 11.5 percent increase in total wages over three years and an additional 14 percent increase to funds administered by HUCTW.
“Our compensation proposal takes into account comparative market factors, as well as the total compensation and benefits package and low attrition rates,” Cuevas-Trisán wrote.
According to the union, the average HUCTW member makes about $65,000 annually. Organizers dispute the claim that Harvard’s wages are competitive compared to other employers.
“Harvard is not competitive with those institutions,” HUCTW President Carrie E. Barbash said. “But even if that’s true, it doesn’t seem like a good reason to not pay your employees enough to just keep up with the basic cost of living.”
The union is still not satisfied with the University’s proposed pay raise, Barbash said.
“We prefer to finish on time, and everyone involved definitely wants to wrap this up, but we also want it to be the strongest contract possible,” she added.
Tuesday’s protesters did not chant or march — instead, roughly a dozen members gathered to pass out flyers explaining their demands.
HUCTW members in attendance said the event was primarily about raising awareness. Last semester, the union held multiple rallies amid stagnant negotiations. In October 2022, more than 3,500 union members signed a statement calling on Harvard to accept HUCTW’s proposed pay raise.
“We’re not at this point escalating our action,” said Jeffrey T. Offermann, a technician in Molecular and Cellular Biology who attended the protest. “We want to get the word out.”
Offermann said workers were frustrated to go without a raise.
“Harvard has been offering a wage increase that doesn’t anywhere near approach the level of inflation,” Offermann said. “That means that as prices for things skyrocket, we’re effectively taking a pay cut.”
In addition to the picketing campaign, HUCTW has launched a faculty outreach program to encourage Harvard faculty to show public support for the negotiations. The union is also calling on its members to write letters to administrators and not work outside their paid hours.
“There probably will be more events where we want to show our strength in numbers,” Jaeger said. “But I think for the informational picketing at Mass. Hall, I think it’s more of creating a feeling of making sure everybody in our community understands — and our management, negotiating counterparts, and senior administrators who are decision makers on all this understand that our determination is great.”
Cuevas-Trisán wrote in Tuesday’s statement that the University will continue to approach negotiations in good faith.
The group plans to continue protesting for two hours every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
“I plan to be out here until Harvard agrees to get a raise that meets inflation and gives us financial progression. That is my stand,” Stearns said. “As long as it takes. As long as it takes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Artist Mary Lum discussed the inspiration and research behind her new exhibition at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at an online lecture Monday.
The event celebrated the opening of Lum’s newly commissioned exhibition, “The Moving Parts (&),” which consists of fragments of images and texts created by other artists that Lum interweaves into temporary constructions.
Meg Rotzel, the curator of exhibitions at the Radcliffe Institute, delivered opening remarks, which were followed by a discussion between art historian Steven D. Nelson and Lum on her inspiration and artistic process. Speakers concluded by answering questions from the audience.
Throughout the event, Lum detailed how her work was inspired by the papers of pop artist Corita Kent, stored at Radcliffe’s Schlesinger Library.
“I took that opportunity to really dig into the eleven boxes of papers and the one big portfolio and the several books that they have, all relating to the life and work of Corita Kent,” Lum said.
Lum also discussed how her exploration of Radcliffe’s archives differed from a traditional scholarly approach to archival research.
“While I used the scholarship to inform me of what I was looking at, I didn’t want to do scholarly research, and I never really approached an archive from the point of view of a scholar,” Lum said. “I approach an archive from the point of view of an artist. I am actually more interested in what an archive looks like than what it contains.”
Lum said she never wanted to create a “linear thread” as an artist, but instead is interested in the “things that you see out of the corner of your eye and on the periphery.”
“I was trying to find the things that no one else would see, or that only I could see because only I was attracted to this orange with this pink,” Lum added.
Lum said she generated her artistic constructions from different arrangements of fractals.
“I literally had the pile of fragments here at my work table, and I put three or five of them together, photographed them, and then shoved them back and put them together in other ways,” she said.
Toward the end of audience questions, Lum described how she repurposes others’ artwork, drawing a distinction between her artistry and appropriation.
“Maybe the building needs to fall down — maybe there is no way to keep it from falling down,” Lum said. “The thing that I do is I destroy things in order to re-arrange them or reform things.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences discussed proposed changes to Harvard’s language requirement and simultaneous enrollment policies at a virtual meeting Tuesday.
Currently, students at Harvard College who do not test out of the foreign language requirement must complete two semesters of a foreign language by the end of their second year or risk disciplinary action from the Administrative Board. The new proposal would encourage students to complete the requirement by the end of their second year, while replacing the administrative penalty with an advising hold.
Under the new policy, students who fail to complete the language requirement by the end of their sophomore year would have to meet with the director of academic policy and “develop a concrete plan” to fulfill the requirement in order to see the hold lifted.
Several faculty members said the requirement is not strong enough as is and that the amendment may further weaken it.
“After a year of Chinese, you can’t even communicate with a balloon,” joked William C. Kirby, a history professor and former FAS dean.
“In a seemingly de-globalizing world, with the rise of nationalism and parochialism, it is more important than ever that we prepare our students to communicate in, and with, a wider world,” he added in a follow-up email.
German Professor Peter J. Burgard asked Acting Dean of Undergraduate Education Anne Harrington ’82, who presented the proposals, to open up a broader discussion about the “woeful state” of Harvard’s language requirement compared to that of Princeton or Yale, which generally require three semesters of foreign language education.
“Both of our closest peer institutions demonstrate a far more serious commitment to basic proficiency,” Burgard said.
The faculty also briefly discussed the second proposal, which would remove an option for students to petition the Ad Board to simultaneously enroll in a class if the instructor of the missed class agrees to provide “hour-for-hour direct and personal compensatory instruction,” excluding recorded lectures or other asynchronous instruction.
Harrington said the exception encumbered the Ad Board and created “an unacceptable burden on the instructor in question.”
The second proposal would also allow instructors of courses with pre-approved waivers for simultaneous enrollment to create certain stipulations or conditions for simultaneously enrolled students, including office hours or limitations on enrollment.
The FAS will vote on both proposals at next month’s meeting.
At the beginning of the meeting, FAS Dean and University President-elect Claudine Gay expanded on her Tuesday announcement that launched the search for her successor, saying that she welcomed feedback and comments from the faculty and was “putting a heavy emphasis on outreach and consultation.”
University President Lawrence S. Bacow, who chaired the meeting, then invited members of the faculty to unmute their microphones to congratulate Gay on her election to the presidency.
“The Corporation has chosen exceptionally well,” Bacow said.
“Thank you for embarrassing me,” a smiling Gay quipped following an eruption of applause and cheers.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 also briefed the faculty on the newly-launched campaign for non-tenure-track faculty unionization.
“If a union is formed, we will engage in good faith in collective bargaining negotiations,” Garber said.

The Economic Development and University Relations committees of the Cambridge City Council held a joint discussion to form recommendations on a laboratory zoning petition and related policy order Tuesday afternoon.
The two committees voted to send a negative recommendation on a petition — which aims to limit the expansion of biotechnology laboratories into Cambridge through amendments to the Cambridge zoning code — and a positive recommendation for a proposed policy order on the creation of a working group that would develop suggestions on lab and neighborhood planning.
City officials first discussed the petition in October 2022, though it was rejected by the Planning Board in December for a lack of specificity.
The petition asks to make a definition of “laboratory use” that differs from other commercial uses and inhibit the construction of new laboratories in certain areas. The petition also requests the establishment of a grandfather clause on all current instances of laboratory use in areas that would become restricted.
Areas that would have restrictions on new biotechnology laboratories include Harvard Square, Central Square, and Porter Square.
Though the items under discussion and in the policy order often hewed closely to the petition’s requests, some city councilors — including Councilors Dennis J. Carlone, Alanna M. Mallon, and Patricia M. Nolan ’80 — argued that the petition failed to connect affordable housing and restriction of laboratories.
“We need to make it very clear that even if something like this passed, there is no guarantee whatsoever that there would be more housing,” Nolan said of the petition. “There’s really two issues we’re trying to deal with. One is the regulation of labs and our neighborhoods, and the other is providing affordable housing.”
Carlone said the Council should acknowledge the impact of its past zoning decisions.
“The Council should recognize we’re the reason that land has gone up in price,” he said. “Previous councils have increased zoning. That’s what did it, so we have to recognize that we have to bite the bullet and pay the price.”
The proposed policy order includes suggestions that the city regulate disturbances like light and noise from laboratories, place restrictions on the size of commercial and laboratory buildings near certain residential neighborhoods, and explore mixed-use development of laboratories and residential units.
These recommendations are now in the hands of the Council and City Manager Yi-An Huang ’05, who must make his own recommendations in consultation with the Development Department and report back to the Council by March 2024.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President Joe Biden’s 2023 State of the Union address evoked applause, jeers, and laughter from attendees at a Harvard Institute of Politics watch party on Tuesday night.
Around 150 students from Harvard College and Harvard Kennedy School gathered in the JFK Jr. Forum for a live viewing of Biden’s address to the joint session of Congress.
As students awaited the State of the Union, they enjoyed popcorn, desserts, and drinks, even bringing their own State of the Union Bingo cards.
Before the address, members of the IOP shared what they hoped Biden would discuss in his speech.
“I think it would be really pertinent if he addressed the police murder of Tyre Nichols and the feeling across the country of mourning and of anger right now,” Tenzin R. Gund-Morrow ’26 said.
Former West Virginia Secretary of State Natalie E. Tennant said she hoped Biden would speak about his plans for the rest of his term.
“I want to know how the President is going to build off the success of the last two years in the next two,” said Tennant, a former IOP resident fellow.
Abby L. Carr ’25, co-chair of the Harvard Conservative Coalition, simply said, “The debt limit.”
Harvard College Democrats hosted their own watch party in the Winthrop House Lion’s Den.
As Biden entered the House Chamber just after 9 p.m., he was met with cheers in both Washington and at the IOP.
At the beginning of Biden’s speech, attendees at Tuesday’s watch party erupted into applause as he congratulated new House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), and then again when Biden congratulated Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), the first Black House Minority Leader.
During his address, Biden attacked “Big Pharma” and condemned the rising cost of pharmaceuticals such as insulin.
“One in 10 Americans has diabetes. Many of you in this chamber do,” Biden said, evoking laughter from attendees.
Biden acknowledged the killing of Tyre Nichols by Memphis police last month, calling for greater police accountability and touting his May 2022 executive order banning chokeholds and restricting no-knock warrants.
“What happened to Tyre in Memphis happens too often. We have to do better,” Biden said.
“Let’s commit ourselves to make the words of Tyre’s mother come true: ‘Something good must come from this,’” he added.
Biden’s discussion of education garnered loud applause from those in attendance at the IOP, even bringing some to their feet.
“Folks, you all know 12 years is not enough to win the economic competition for the 21st century,” Biden said. “Let’s give public school teachers a raise.”
Many at the watch party broke out in laughter as the camera turned to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) as Biden made jabs at policy regarding the deficit, energy, and social security, respectively.
As Biden’s second State of the Union drew to a close, he focused on bipartisan issues and ended on an optimistic note highlighting America’s resilience through the past turbulent years.
“Because the soul of this nation is strong, because the backbone of this nation is strong, because the people of this nation are strong, the State of the Union is strong.” Biden said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard academics discussed recent political unrest in Peru and Brazil at a Weatherhead Center for International Affairs seminar on Tuesday.
Panelists Steven R. Levitsky, a professor of Latin American Studies and Government, and Fernando A. Bizzarro, a Ph.D. candidate in Government, reflected on public demonstrations and the political climate in Peru and Brazil. The panel was moderated by Frances Hagopian, the faculty chair of the Brazil Studies Program at the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies.
During the event, Levitsky outlined the history of Peruvian politics that led up to the 2022 impeachment and imprisonment of Pedro Castillo, Peru’s former president.
The impeachment led to ongoing protests in Peru, though Levitsky said the demonstrations were “never really about Castillo.”
“Castillo’s fall was more of a catalyst, like the rise in metro fares in Chile,” Levitsky said. “People protested for a bunch of different reasons.”
Levitsky also offered his own solution on how to approach the current Peruvian political crisis.
“One thing that basically all the protesters shared in common was the demand for new elections,” Levitsky said. “The only possible exit under democracy is immediate election.”
The panelists also discussed recent political unrest in Brazil. On Jan. 8, 2023, a group in support of former Brazilian President Jair M. Bolsonaro raided government offices, including the Brazilian Congress, the Palácio da Alvorada, and the Supreme Court.
“From that day, those of us who were watching from abroad were in some way feeling the way which I believe the Americans felt on January 6,” Bizzarro said.
Bizzarro defended the Brazilian Supreme Court’s response to the unrest, though he acknowledged there is ongoing debate over whether the body is “overreaching.”
“The way I understand what’s going on right now is that it’s an exceptional response by the Brazilian democracy, or its democratic institutions, to the unprecedented situation of having the president and the military and its allies trying to overthrow the government,” Bizzarro said.
Bizzarro added that he believes international pressure will be integral to maintaining democracy in Brazil.
“I think the international community is playing a major role in Brazil in helping secure democracy,” he said.
Despite ongoing protests, Levitsky said he believes the potential for civil war in Peru and other countries in Latin America remains low, though not impossible.
“It’s not very likely that any state in South America will slide into civil war,” Levitsky said. “That said, if Peru slides into military rule and there continues to be a focus exclusively on repression, it’s hard to say.”
According to Levitsky, “tension of party, weakness, and fragmentation” contributed to Peru’s unique political crisis, but there is “evidence” that other Latin American countries may be destabilizing as well.
Hagopian concluded the talk by noting the potential consequences of political instability in Latin America.
“It is terrifying, for those of us who lived through the last long stretches of authoritarianism in Latin America. It’s really terrifying,” Hagopian said.
“I will leave it to all of you to decide whether you’re more depressed or more optimistic as you leave this room today,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Journalist and author Gillian Tett said anthropology is one of the “most unrecognized and most useful tools” for social scientists at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum Monday.
Tett, who serves as the U.S. editor-at-large of The Financial Times and chairs the publication’s editorial board, discussed the role anthropology can have in helping economists better understand the world and its challenges.
Tett delivered the IOP’s 2023 Malcolm H. Wiener Lecture on International Political Economy. Past lecturers have included former Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, former United Kingdom Prime Minister Gordon Brown, and Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve Lael Brainard.
Unlike many economic columnists, Tett holds a Ph.D. in social anthropology, rather than in economics. Tett said anthropology provides “lateral vision” that can help economists better understand the global context.
Jason Furman ’92, professor at the Kennedy School and former chief economist to President Barack Obama, introduced Tett on Monday. Furman lauded Tett’s accurate predictions about the 2008 financial crisis at a time when many economists were “reassuring us that no problem was on the horizon.”
“She was one of the very first people to warn about the financial crisis before it occurred,” Furman said. “It was precisely because of that Ph.D. in anthropology.”
Tett said many economists failed to see “the cultural pattern” underlying the financial crisis, adding that it is crucial to view economic issues in a context beyond only “looking at the numbers.”
When Tett first entered the world of economics, she said she “didn’t talk much” about the field of anthropology because she believed others viewed her interest in the discipline as “really, really weird.”
With her nontraditional academic background, Tett found success in the financial industry as “an insider-outsider,” she said, bringing a fresh perspective to economic issues.
According to Tett, anthropology is “a bit like salt”; it can be paired with many other disciplines to “bring out the flavors and bind them together” to create a “better way of looking at the world.”
Tett added she believes many can benefit from the lens of anthropology, particularly in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.
“The lockdowns have turned us all into amateur anthropologists,” Tett said. “We’ve all undergone that experience of being tossed out of our familiar world into a new place and having to look at the world afresh.”
In today’s economic landscape, Tett said the financial industry needs a “reality check,” which anthropologists could provide.
“I would love the Fed, I’d love some of the big banks, I'd love some of the rating agencies to just hire a few anthropologists and get their insights to complement what others are getting,” Tett said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few short weeks ago, Harvard men’s basketball (12-11, 3-6 Ivy) was 3-3 in the Ivy League and fresh off of scoring a season-high 95 points in a scintillating 95-89 home victory over Cornell (15-7, 5-4 Ivy). The Crimson had yet to lose any back-to-back games against league opponents and maintained a strong defensive force.
After Saturday’s 68-65 loss to Brown (12-10, 5-4 Ivy), Harvard now sits seventh in the Ivy League and has lost three games in a row. Despite nearly completing several miraculous comebacks, the Crimson has nothing to show for its efforts and is left searching for answers.
HARVARD OUTPLAYED BY YALE, 68-57
The energetic band playing to a sold-out Lavietes Pavilion set the tone for a game that started at a frantic pace. With both teams desperate to assert their control, the stakes of a rivalry matchup were clear from tip-off. Yale (16-6, 6-3 Ivy) jumped out with an early lead with sophomore guard Bez Mbeng and senior forward EJ Jarvis, who scored a game-high 18 points against Harvard in a 58-54 victory on January 7th, demonstrating the Bulldogs’ physicality.
“They really took it to us in the paint,” head coach Tommy Amaker said. “The post guys for their team were aggressive early on the offensive glass. The points in the paint were an indication of the physicality and aggressiveness of their team, not just with their shooting, but with the offensive rebound opportunities.”
With six minutes gone, Harvard fought back to level the score at 9-9. That margin would not last long, as the Bulldogs immediately started to pull away. Yale’s direct, high-energy play seemed to overwhelm the Crimson. The physical presence of Jarvis in the paint proved a persistent pain for the Harvard defense and when shots were forced wide, Yale shot an impressive 5-for-9 (55.6%) first-half three-point rate – the defensive resilience that has defined Harvard’s play this season was being compromised by a relentless offensive performance by Yale.
On the other end of the court, Harvard struggled as well. From the three-point range, the Crimson didn’t make a single shot in the first half, going 0-for-5. In many games this season, Harvard has compensated for poor three-point shooting with dominance inside the paint, but against the Bulldogs, the Crimson shot 6-for-21 (28.6%) in the opening 20 minutes compared to their opponents 17-for-33 (51.5%). The result of a dismal first half for Harvard was a 17-point deficit at the break.
In order to give themselves any chance, the Crimson desperately needed a change in pace for the second half. Half-time sub, first-year guard Chandler Piggé, recorded a steal in Yale’s first possession, but as the shot clock ran down, senior guard Idan Tretout was forced to take a tough three-pointer which missed the rim, continuing Harvard’s three-point catastrophe.
Throughout the game, Harvard struggled to create quality shot opportunities, typically using the full-time allotted by the shot clock, yet still failing to consistently get points on the board.
“There’s an old saying ‘be quick but don’t hurry’,” Amaker said. “We looked and played like we were in a hurry. With the pressure rising we were trying to do things in a rush instead of being sharp and quick.”
Despite its poor play at times, the Crimson was an improved team in the second period and managed to cut a 19-point Bulldog lead to five with several minutes left in the game.
The game came to an inflection point with 1:40 left on the clock. Solid Harvard defense forced Yale sophomore guard John Poulakidas to take a deep three-pointer which wrapped around the rim before harmlessly being rebounded by the Crimson. Tretout then surged upcourt with intent, driving to the rim before faking a shot and pivoting to sling a pass back to senior co-captain Luka Sakota, who stood open on the edge of the three. A made shot would have brought the Crimson within three points of a lead at 62-60, but the ball bounced off the rim, keeping the deficit at 62-57.
“I was proud of our guys for giving great effort and giving it an opportunity to go our way in the second half.” Amaker reflected. “I thought we had a moment there (with Luka’s three). That would’ve been a big one for us to see how the game would’ve evolved.”
Yale scored all six of the remaining points in the game to win 68-57, condemning Harvard to a fourth consecutive defeat against the Bulldogs.
HARVARD COMEBACK FALLS JUST SHORT VS. BROWN, 68-65
Less than 24 hours after the conclusion of the Yale game, the Crimson took home court again for a Saturday-night matchup against Brown.
Harvard started quickly, getting points on the board within the opening five seconds with a layup from junior forward Justice Ajogbor. It immediately became clear that Brown had come to play as the Bears surged into a 10-2 lead through seven quick points from senior guard Paxson Wojcik.
Brown’s Wojcik remained a pain in the side of the Crimson throughout the game, recording a game-high 23 points and sinking several deep three-pointers while relentlessly driving at the Crimson defense. After the game, Wojcik reflected on his approach.
“They got us at home a couple of weeks ago so we knew we had to get them back,” Wojcik said. “They’re a great team, we knew it was gonna be a dog fight. I’m just proud of the way we played and came out with the win.”
At the end of the first half, the game was still neck-to-neck. A pair of Tretout free throws had the game tied at 26-26 before the Bears used the final five seconds to throw down another lay-up and reclaim a two-point lead.
What ultimately sealed Harvard’s fate was a span of six minutes in the second period. Harvard came out of the break playing positively, exchanging baskets with Brown and taking a 34-33 lead with 17:24 left in the game. The Crimson then suffered a rare defensive collapse in which Brown scored 16 consecutive points unanswered to make it a 15-point game.
“We put ourselves in a hole,” Amaker said after the game. “We did it last night and again tonight, and that’s not good for us. We don’t have the kind of firepower where we can blast our way out of it. We’re not that kind of offensive juggernaut where we can just go on a 16-0 run. That’s not who we’ve been and that’s not who we are.”
Despite its shortcomings, Harvard worked hard and got into a position to tie the game late on. With 6 seconds on the clock, Sakota hit a 3-pointer, and sophomore guard Evan Nelson immediately fouled Wojcik on the inbound, sending Wojcik to the free throw line with the opportunity to shoot two and put the game out of reach. Wojcik, however, only made one of two free throws, leaving the game within one shot of overtime with three seconds left on the clock.
In a desperate final attempt, first-year forward Chisom Okpara heaved the ball forward to senior forward Chris Ledlum who out-jumped two defenders to give himself a half-second to release a buzzer-beating three-point shot. As Lavietes Pavilion rose to its feet, the ball missed just wide, sending the Brown bench into celebration.
“Most of the time you get what you deserve and, in my opinion, we weren’t deserving of victory,” Amaker said. “We fought hard to try to get it and sometimes you can not deserve to win and still win and we were trying to make that happen, but obviously we’ll take it and try to get better from it.”
To make the Ivy Madness tournament at the end of the season, the Crimson will need to make use of their five remaining games to climb into the top four.
In that vein, Harvard will look to set themselves back on track when they host Penn next Saturday at 2:00 pm. On January 28th, the Crimson lost to the Quakers in an 83-68 battle in Philadelphia but now will play with an added sense of urgency. Penn (13-11, 5-4 Ivy) sits tied for third place behind Princeton (16-6, 7-2 Ivy) and Yale.

Are you feeling lonely? Are you looking for a new friend or something more *wink wink*? Well have no fear, Datamatch is here!
Datamatch is a matchmaking app that was founded at Harvard in 1994 where students can opt to fill out a survey to find love or even maybe a ~friend~. Every year, the Algorithm manages to “match” 50,000 students, spread over 40 campuses, to someone they can hopefully tolerate. Also, you have a pretty good chance of matching with your crush, seeing that 80 percent of Harvard undergraduates participate in this opportunity to shoot their shot.
We sat down with this year’s cupids, Chelsea E. Guo ’24 and Alex V. Cheng ’24 to get the inside scoop on the survey most Harvard students are guaranteed to fill out.
The Breakdown:
Maybe you’ve been living under a rock (or a pile of chocolate), but if you’re not really sure how Datamatch works, we’ve got you covered ;)
CEG: What happens is on Feb. 7, which is coming up very soon, we send out this really funny survey that has a bunch of inside jokes and cultural references. People take it, they fill it out throughout the week, they play with our website, and then on Valentine’s Day, Feb. 14, they get a list of 10 algorithmically selected matches, and they get little coupons and they get to go on free dates with people in Harvard Square.
AVC: For those people that are already cuffed, they also have a friendship option as well. So, if they want to just look for a Datamatch and get algorithmically matched for platonic friendship, that’s definitely an option for them to sign up as well.
What You Need to Know:
So maybe you’re thinking, ‘Huh, how can I take advantage of this wonderful opportunity to finally not be lonely anymore?’ Here are two features the Cupids recommend:
CEG: One of them is Crush Roulette. So that’s the thing where if you put in two people’s emails — it could be your own email, or it could be your friend's email, and their crush too — you get a slightly higher chance of getting matched by the algorithm. So yeah, it’s super fun. Like, people have been making jokes about it. We always get asked, can you just hardcode my match for me — which we can’t, but that’s the closest option: to use Crush Roulette.
CEG: The other thing is our block list. So sometimes people are like, “I don’t want to be with my toxic ex,” or “I’m so afraid I’m going to run into so-and-so,” you know, a sneaky link or whatever. So yeah, you can put in somebody’s email on the block list as well. And then we’ll make sure that you don't get matched with them — so, safety precaution.
What You Have Been Waiting For:
If you’ve been at Harvard and single for a while, you probably knew all that already, so here’s what you’ve actually clicked on this article for:
HEK: Do you have any dating advice for the people?
CEG: Alex is actually dating one of his Datamatch matches.
AVC: I feel like Datamatch isn’t like a super serious thing, and that kind of helps with dating.
AVC: At Harvard, people are always like, “Oh, dating takes up too much time. I don’t want to commit to one person because it just takes too much time and I don’t want to put that investment in.” But I feel like dating should be viewed as more of a fun thing. It's not necessarily some super serious thing. Like my current girlfriend, I matched with her and she was, I think she was like my last match. But I decided to reach out anyway. And we’d known each other beforehand. But yeah, just shoot your shot, like it doesn’t really matter. And like, no one really cares so you might as well just try — it never hurts to try.
CEG: Yeah, I think that’s one of the most important takeaways. You never know what’s going to happen. So don’t be afraid to shoot your shot.
AK: What does love mean to you?
CEG: I have been very happy to have been surrounded by so much love in Datamatch, to be completely honest. As leads, Alex and I have been working really hard to try to make sure that our team dynamic and that our members and our leads really enjoy the work that they’re doing. And honestly, I’m feeling a lot of love in Datamatch. I feel like we all take care of each other very well. We work very hard together. I feel love in the not romantic sense, right, in a more platonic sense, or taking care of each other and really supporting each other with everything that we’re doing. That is a definition of love that I’ve been feeling a lot this year.
AVC: Yeah, I think that's a pretty great definition.
HEK: If you could describe your type with a Harvard house, which house would it be?
CEG: Oh. Mine is gonna be a hot take. I love Currier and I love Currier dining hall. Everybody gives it so much hate because they say it looks old. But I think it looks very warm. It looks very inviting. I love the green. So I would say my type is totally Currier, specifically Currier dining hall.
AVC: I think I'm gonna go with Adams because I'm in Adams and my girlfriend also got lotteried into Adams after we started dating. So I think I have to go with Adams, or else it would not be right.
So that’s a wrap on our Datamatch coverage this year featuring the lovely Cupids. Be bold, make the first move, and stay safe out there. May the algorithm treat you well and the odds be ever in your favor.
