After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
June 28, 1969
Police arrested 13 people while raiding the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in New York City.
These arrests provoked six days of protests throughout the city as outraged activists, tired of the prejudiced pattern of shutting down gay bars, took to the streets. Among the first protesters were Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, trans women of color who became prominent activists in the fight for LGBTQ equality.
The legal justification for the police raid at Stonewall was that the bar had no license to sell liquor. However, as the State Liquor Authority refused to grant licenses to gay bars, this was in actuality a thinly-veiled excuse to target gay clubs, further smother the community, and silence the voices of those demanding justice and equality for queer people.

June 17, 2017
Police arrested four protesters at the Stonewall Columbus Pride March in Columbus, Ohio.
These four were part of a larger group of protesters who blocked the march route to hold a seven minute moment of silence to commemorate Philando Castile the day after the officer who unjustly killed him was acquitted on all charges—one minute for each bullet fired. The protesters wrote in an a statement that this moment of silence was “an effort to raise awareness about the violence against and erasure of black and brown queer and trans people, in particular the lack of space for black and brown people at pride festivals.”
The legal justification for the four arrests was that the protesters had no permit to block the street. However, this was in actuality an excuse to ignore the intersectional nature of social activism, police black and brown bodies, and silence the voices of those demanding justice and equality for black and brown people, specifically in the LGBTQ community.

As I compare the above events, two truths stand out to me.
1. As history denotes, pride is rooted in protest.
2. While black and brown queer and trans people have helped lead the fight for LGBTQ equality, they’ve been consistently marginalized and ignored within their own community.
Stonewall started out as a protest against police brutality, and people of color were fighting on the front lines from the beginning. These protests were the catalyst for our pride marches today. It’s incredibly hypocritical to delegitimize a protest against injustice while at a march that began as a protest against injustice, which is exactly what happened at the Stonewall Columbus Pride March. The inclusion of “Stonewall” in the name as an homage to the original protests in New York only adds to the upsetting irony.
Because the LGBTQ community is made up of people marginalized for their identity, it can be hard to believe that we would further marginalize members of our own community. But this has been happening for decades, and it continues today.
We marginalize queer people of color when we write “no Asians, no black people” on our Grindr bios, and when the only queer representation in media is white. Even when we marginalize people of color in non-queer-specific ways, such as casual microaggressions, that still contributes to the marginalization of queer people of color. People do not live in vacuums of individual identities; they exist as all of their identities.
We marginalize trans people when we view marriage equality as the ultimate success for the LGBTQ community, ignoring the fight for bathroom access and healthcare for trans people.
We marginalize every other queer identity when we center gay people as the most important and visible members of our community, and when we continue to view gender, sexual orientation, and romantic attraction as binaries rather than spectrums.
I’ve been privileged to grow up in an era when pride mostly presents itself as a joyous parade, colorfully celebrating the beauty of love and how far we’ve come in our struggle for equality. But we can’t let rainbow-themed festivities erase the long history of protest that paved the way, or the intersectional identities of the iconic activists who led those protests.
A few weeks ago, I marched in Boston Pride for the first time. With a rainbow flag in my hair and colored rhinestones adorning my face, I thought I’d captured the spirit of pride. But while marching amidst the rainbow floats and “Love is love” posters, a sign caught my eye. The quote on it was, “The Stonewall Riots were started by trans women of color. So why is Pride all about cis gay white men?”
That poster made me and my glittered-out face do a double take, and it got me thinking. How have I used my experiences as a queer person of color to speak out against racism in the LGBTQ community? How have I misused my privilege as a cis person to marginalize and erase trans identities, thus contributing to structural violence against trans people?
If we’re going to celebrate as a community, we need to make sure that everyone in our community is included, protected, and heard. May our upbeat music and cheering at pride never drown out the voices of those we have marginalized.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In recent years, activists, students, and authors have framed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a simple one. The mantra of a cruel Israeli state oppressing the Palestinians is ubiquitous in many intellectual circles.
Most recently, such arguments were heard in these pages when an author called the Palestinian cause, “the least radical cause in the world.” In recounting his Harvard-organized trip to the West Bank, he depicts Palestinians going about their days scurrying from business meetings to social gatherings and lounging in posh cafes. All that is missing from this picturesque description are cute, wide-eyed children playing soccer and eating candy. His few placid days in Ramallah, we are to believe, make the Palestinian cause entirely just and the Israeli policies entirely unjust.
Unfortunately, conclusions about and solutions to centuries-old conflicts cannot be reached in such a short time.
The vast majority of Palestinians, like the vast majority of Israelis, want to lead normal lives of business meetings, afternoons in cafes, and soccer games. But it is unhelpful and disingenuous to be intentionally simplistic to push a political agenda. It is not just the author who falls into this trap, or walks into it intentionally, but the entire Boycott, Divest, and Sanction movement which calls for economic and social isolation of the Jewish state.
I too went on a Harvard-affiliated trip to the Holy Land. We left Logan Airport as 50 strangers and returned from Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion united both in friendship and in the conviction that the most dangerous conclusions to draw about the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians are those that lack nuance.
I knew going into the trip that my pro-Israel sentiments were sure to be challenged. They were. We met with Jewish settlers in the West Bank who reveled in establishing their communities on the land of a future Palestinian state. We listened as an ultra-right Orthodox Jewish leader defended the second-class role many women in his community are relegated to. We heard Netanyahu ally and mayor of Jerusalem, Nir Barkat, tell us inside the City Council Chambers that his was a city without walls or divisions. We could all think of one glaring, concrete exception.
This is the paradox the BDS movement attempts to set up for us: a benign, oppressed Palestinian populace held back from their potential and their human rights by the cold, oppressive Israelis. Therefore, they say, Harvard should divest from this apartheid state. The problem, however, is that they purposefully ignore some of the most important components: the ones that don’t fit their ideology.
They deplore the situation in Gaza, yet they ignore that Israel pulled out of Gaza more than a decade ago. They ignore that the Israeli military forcibly removed those Jewish settlers from Gaza who would not leave voluntarily. This same move, to be repeated in the West Bank if the divestment advocates had their way, led to the takeover of the Gaza government by the Palestinian militant group Hamas. Instead of a vibrant Palestinian state in Gaza, it is a terrorist haven in which the people are repressed by their fundamentalist rulers. Hamas does not spend the billions it receives in foreign aid on schools or hospitals, but rather on tunnels through which terrorists can attack Israel and cash stipends to incentivize suicide bombers, children included. Why should Israel repeat the mistake in the West Bank?
Maybe it wouldn’t matter. Israel is already surrounded by millions of people who, inspired by their leaders and a perverted version of Islam, hate them. As an Israeli mother told me on our trip, “If the Jews had our way, there would be a Jewish state and a Palestinian state in which we could guarantee our ability to survive. If the Palestinian leaders had their way, there wouldn’t be any Jews left, much less a Jewish state.”
Such fear is understandable. Just listen to the leaders of the country my own family comes from, Iran, who have called Israel a cancer to be “wiped off the map” and  “annihilated”. They might know that’s already been tried, but they question the reality of the Holocaust, so fat chance.
There is undoubtedly progress to be made in Israel. In Nazareth, we heard mothers bemoan the inadequate funding given to Arab-Israeli schools compared to Jewish-Israeli schools. There are other such complaints of discrimination. However, unlike Black South Africans, the Palestinians and Arab-Israelis have considerable representation in Israeli institutions. Take for example, Salim Joubran, the Arab-Israeli serving as Vice President of the Israeli Supreme Court. This isn’t just token representation. The Court regularly rules in favor of these minority groups and against the Israeli government. Maybe the BDS movement could remind us how many Black South Africans sat on the Apartheid-era South African Supreme Court?
If the BDS movement is keen on boycotting apartheid states, they should start with Iran or Saudi Arabia. There are oppressed women and LGBTQ+ people who would love to explain what a real apartheid state looks like. Sadly they’re unavailable at the moment, as they are currently imprisoned by their apartheid states.
Despite all of this, the extreme lengths to which Israel has gone to defend itself from perennial rocket fire, exploding school busses, and terrorist massacres may cause Americans to recoil at the limitations placed on the civil liberties of Palestinians and Arab-Israelis. We can still side with liberty over security, as I do, but let’s not pretend these security measures are in place to intentionally hold back the vast majority of peaceful Palestinians. They are to hold back those who would drive the Jews into the sea, given the chance.
Many BDS activists have gone to the Holy Land and returned sages with a simple solution: Israel is the racist, apartheid state. I went to the region and returned with more questions than answers, more assured of the humanity of people on both sides. The only thing of which I am sure on this issue is that so many on the left drastically oversimplify the conflict by lionizing the Palestinians and demonizing Israel.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: June 29, 2017 at 12:18 p.m.
Patrick Wales-Dinan, a Harvard track coach who was the subject of several investigations into his leadership of the women’s distance running program, will step down from his position at the end of the month.
The head coach of the track program, Jason S. Saretsky, announced Wales-Dinan’s departure in an email to program members Tuesday. During his three years as coach, Wales-Dinan became embroiled in controversy for his polarizing coaching style as many women left the teams—the program shrank from 23 members in Wales-Dinan’s first year to just 11 in his third.
While some lauded him as a successful and supportive coach, other former and current team members charged that Wales-Dinan encouraged unhealthy eating habits and created a toxic culture on the team. In October, some former members of the team asked for Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise to fire Wales-Dinan.
“We all ran under Patrick [Wales-Dinan] at one point or another, now are no longer members of the Harvard Cross Country and Track programs, and feel strongly that he should not be either,” the former athletes wrote in an email to Scalise and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana obtained by The Crimson.
The behavior and complaints spurred a series of investigations conducted by the team’s faculty fellows, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences human resources department, and the College’s Title IX office. The Crimson reported on the numerous investigations and an increasingly divided women’s cross country team in March.
Saretsky wrote that the Athletics Department will conduct a national search for a new coach and will include student athlete feedback in the process.
“Harvard Athletics and I are committed to hiring an outstanding coach that embodies our values as an Ivy League athletics program,” Saretsky wrote.
Formal inquiries into Wales-Dinan began months ago. In October 2016, Wales-Dinan became the focus of a brief Title IX review after his interactions with an athlete in a online training video caused debate on the online running forum LetsRun. That review prompted a broader human resources investigation into the team’s culture.
More recently, in a op-ed published in The Crimson earlier this month, Lauren B. Kuntz, a volunteer coach with the track program, described a “hostile environment” on the women’s cross country team. She charged members of the coaching staff with endangering the health and wellbeing of athletes, encouraging unhealthy eating habits and overtraining, Kuntz declined to comment on Wales-Dinan’s departure.
Scalise responded to Kuntz’s letter in a letter to The Crimson days later, writing that the investigation into the team had concluded and “revealed a number of areas that must be addressed.”
“The Athletics Department is currently in the process of implementing the recommendations resulting from the investigation and is committed to making visible and meaningful progress,” Scalise wrote.
Athletics Department spokesperson Timothy J. Williamson declined to comment on whether Wales-Dinan’s resignation is directly connected to the HR investigation.
Human Evolutionary Biology Department Chair Daniel E. Lieberman, one of the program’s faculty fellows, also declined to comment on Wales-Dinan’s departure but wrote in an email that he is hopeful the program will continue to address concerns in the future.
“Let’s just say that I am in touch with numerous runners, past and present, on the team and continue to have a wide range of concerns that need to be addressed,” Lieberman wrote. “I very much hope we will make progress on all these issues in the coming months.”
Wales-Dinan did not respond to request for comment.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: 
CORRECTION: June 29, 2017
A previous version of this story incorrectly indicated that Lauren B. Kuntz is an assistant distance running coach for Harvard track. In fact, she is a volunteer coach for the Harvard Track and Field team and does not focus specifically on distance running.

On June 14, 2017, University President Drew G. Faust announced she would step down at the conclusion of the 2017-2018 school year. She has led Harvard since 2007, through three U.S. presidencies, a largest-in-a-generation financial crisis, and a record-shattering capital campaign.
The Crimson reported on June 21 that the committee to choose her successor would be composed of all 12 members of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, in addition to three members of the Board of Overseers, the University’s second highest governing body. 
Last week, the Harvard Gazette—a publication run by Harvard Public Affairs and Communications—posted an interview with William F. Lee ’72, the Corporation’s senior fellow. As the de facto head of the search committee, the only member to have participated in a previous search effort, and one of Faust’s strongest backers in 2007, he will likely be an influential voice at the table. 
We take a look at what his comments presage for the year-long presidential search as well as the issues and stances the search committee may prioritize.

Here Lee highlights the next year’s—and likely the next president’s—most important agenda items: continuing to centralize Harvard’s sometimes-disparate parts, maintaining academic excellence, navigating the national political climate, improving Harvard’s diversity, and stewarding the University’s financials.
These trends have dominated Harvard’s decade under Faust. Lee describes each item in more detail below, but it’s interesting the note what the head of the Corporation wishes to highlight for potential candidates, many of whom will likely read his remarks.
Presidential searches tend to be marked either by a desire for a continuity or a hankering for change. In 2001, the leadership of mild-mannered former University President Neil L. Rudenstine spurred questions about candidates’ vision for Harvard. By 2006, a divided university sought a less combative leader who differed, at least in style, with former University President Lawrence H. Summers, who resigned after repeated clashes with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Lee’s positive words about Faust suggest the search committee will seek someone else like Faust: dynamic in thought but sometimes cautious in approach.

One of the search committee’s priorities will be vetting candidates for one of largest responsibilities of Harvard’s president: fundraising. In 2014, Faust told The Crimson that she spends nearly half of her time wooing donors and attending events. Since the campaign’s launch, she has visited more than a dozen cities around the world as part of the “Your Harvard” event series alone.
In 2007, one of the two candidates for the job withdrew after concerns that he lacked sufficient experience in fundraising.
The University’s next leader will have to contend with a post-capital campaign fundraising landscape at a time when strong returns from the endowment look less assured and federal research funding is less certain. It seems likely that the Corporation—especially given recent efforts to add members with experience in development and finance—will vet candidates with an eye to directing and expanding the budget of the world’s richest university. 

In 2006, Summers resigned after a faculty no-confidence vote, driven in part by objections to his push for the centralization of authority in the University. That hasn’t changed under Faust. And if these comments from Lee are any indication, standardizing policy and centralizing power will continue to be a trend under the next president.
The most visible effects have been in fundraising. The current Harvard capital campaign is the first such University-wide effort, the culmination of centralization moves begun in the 1990s under Rudenstine. As Lee points out, Harvard famously used to put “every tub on its own bottom,” mandating that each school look after itself. By contrast, coordinated “One Harvard” messaging has been omnipresent in recent efforts from Harvard’s fundraising office.
The vision articulated by Lee and Faust, however, is much broader. Lee’s comments to the Gazette argue that changing political, cultural, and technological developments have made “One Harvard” the Corporation’s preferred organizational philosophy.
Early on, in addition to University-wide fundraising, Faust continued efforts to create a University-wide calendar and foster interdisciplinary academic collaboration. Subsequent initiatives included a single sexual assault policy (from which the Law School was subsequently exempted), and virtual education via edX.
If, as Lee said, commitment to centralization represented a litmus test for dean selection, it will certainly be so for the coming presidential search.
Presidential candidates: take note. Here, Lee sets the agenda for the next chapter of the University’s history.
He begins with the finances. The CEO of Harvard Management Company, N.P. Narvekar, will be in the midst of a years-long overhaul of Harvard’s struggling endowment when the next president takes office. Returning the endowment to the forefront of institutional investing will be an important early step for Harvard’s next leader. Poor returns in fiscal year 2016—the latest in a string of subpar returns—have squeezed Harvard’s budgets.
Research funding, threatened by lawmakers in Washington, as well as a concluding capital campaign will also make financial acumen an important quality in Harvard’s next president.
Financial concerns aside, Harvard’s role on the national stage has grown dramatically since the November election of President Donald Trump. Faust has overseen the development of a sizeable lobbying operation—scheduling two additional Washington trips herself—to advocate for Harvard’s interests on science funding, the tax status of the endowment, immigration, and a host of other issues.
She has also maintained a relatively high international profile, traveling to numerous foreign countries and meeting with heads of state including Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Whoever next takes up her Massachusetts Hall office must be prepared, more so than ever before, to lobby on Harvard’s behalf. It is unclear whether this will help or hurt candidates with political experience. Some may argue that they have the relevant experience or expertise; others may say that known partisan quantities are unlikely to be effective at reaching both sides of the aisle. 

Harvard has expanded programs in continuing and executive education, developed the online learning portal edX, and sought to provide Harvard resources to Allston residents.
Nitin Nohria, Dean of Harvard Business School, oversaw the launch and growth of HBX, the online learning arm of the Business School. HBS has also under his tenure expanded facilities for executive education, a revenue stream now worth more to the University each year than undergraduate tuition.
The Medical School under newly named Dean George Q. Daley ’82 also recently launched HMX, a similar online certificate program.
“Innovation” in degree programs and learning might encompass the newly announced joint engineering and business master’s degree program or Faust’s emphasis on the arts, including the launch of the Theater, Dance, and Media concentration for undergraduates. Activists have also urged administrators to develop an ethnic studies program; the Committee on Degrees in History and Literature announced an ethnic studies subfield in April.
Such experience could prove an asset if the committee puts an emphasis on new academic programs or alternative revenue sources. 

It is less clear here to what issues Lee is referring, but some guesses: interdisciplinary studies; the balance between basic and applied research; the role of start up culture at Harvard; and the University’s place in confronting challenging national and global issues including climate change, a divisive political culture, and global health. 


Faust’s tenure at Harvard has seen debates over diversity and inclusion feature prominently. On campus, among other changes, House Masters have been rechristened Faculty Deans, a plaque was installed at Wadsworth House to commemorate slaves held at Harvard, and a task force was formed to study inclusivity on campus. That body—similar to a diversity initiative led by Faust before she became president—is co-led by University Professor Danielle S. Allen, a Government professor and rising star.
In the wake of the presidential election, Faust has grappled with renewed calls for ethnic studies, opposed President Trump’s immigration orders, and rejected calls for Harvard to be labeled a sanctuary campus.
Others, however, argue these measures have gone to far. A slate of Overseers candidates last year called for an end to affirmative action and Harvard currently faces a lawsuit alleging its admissions practices discriminate against Asian Americans. Others believe free speech is under attack on Harvard’s campus.
The single-gender social organization sanctions might also fall into this category.
