After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Citing  financial difficulties and an uncooperative landlord, Arrow Street  Crepes, the Harvard Square creperie located near the intersection of  Mass. Ave. and Arrow St., closed its doors earlier this month.
“It’s  my opinion that the creperie had to leave because we were dealing with a  landlord that didn’t want us there,” said James E. Murray, the owner  and founder of the shop, known also as “La Creperie.”
According  to Murray, the rent was rising, and it was getting “increasingly  difficult” to pay. He said he asked his landlord for leniency on rent  payments as he is running two businesses in Cambridge during a tight  economy. But the landlord turned down the request.
Debbie  DeJesus, who co-owns the building with her sister, said that over the  past year all her tenants have struggled to pay rent.
“But  I’ve tried to work with them and do what I can do,” DeJesus said,  noting, however, that the sisters had failed to reach an agreement with  Murray.
“We’re  a small business. We’re not a big corporation,” said Murray, whose  creperie at 1154 Mass Ave. has served Harvard Square for 12 years. “If  we could have gotten some consideration from the landlord then we could  have found a way to stay there.”
Murray  owns another restaurant called Canteen a few blocks down Mass Ave. from  his creperie. Located at 983 Massachusetts Ave, the gourmet sandwich  shop opened on May 22.
Murray  introduced crepes to the menu a month after its opening but decided to  take them off so his two restaurants would not be in competition with  one another. But with the closing of La Creperie, Murray said he plans  to begin serving crepes at Canteen.
The  restaurant will begin offering crepes this Friday and will be offering  free crepes the next day to anyone with a Harvard ID, he said.
Meanwhile, DeJesus said she is actively looking for a tenant to fill the empty property that the creperie left behind.
“I’m pretty confident that we’ll get someone here soon because it’s a great location,” DeJesus said.
Murray’s  quaint restaurant served over 40 types of crepes, including sweet  crepes, salads, and smoothies. He said he is currently working with the  president of the Harvard Student Agencies to find a new home for La  Creperie in Harvard Square.
Andeb,  LLC—the partnership that owns the building—wrote in a statement that  they were disappointed in the outcome and wished Murray the best.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Updated: Jan. 12 at 12:25 p.m.
Schools within Harvard University have announced that classes will be canceled on Wednesday, and the University has advised a large portion of its staff not to report to work in light of a storm that may bring up to 16 inches of snow to the Boston area.
The Harvard Law School, the Harvard Medical School, the Harvard School of Public Health, the Harvard School of Dental Medicine, the Harvard Kennedy School, the Harvard Extension School, and the Harvard Graduate School of Education have canceled classes. The Harvard Business School "will operate in a limited capacity," the Harvard Divinity School will provide "limited, essential services only," and the Harvard Graduate School of Design will offer January Term classes at their instructors' discretion, the schools said in announcements on their websites.
 
In an e-mail to students of Harvard College, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds said that dining hall employees, shuttle operators, and snow removal personnel will report to work Wednesday. Classes at the College are currently not in session, though more than 1,200 students have been granted housing.
 Exterior doors to the buildings of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the University's largest school and the home of Harvard College, will be locked, FAS Dean of Administration and Finance Leslie A. Kirwan '79 wrote in an e-mail to staff members.
 The announcements came as weather forecasts reported a snowstorm approaching the New England area. The National Weather Service issued a blizzard warning Tuesday afternoon, predicting 12 to 16 inches of snow and wind gusts up to 45 miles per hour, and Cambridge has declared a snow emergency parking ban that takes effect tomorrow.
According to advisories sent to employees throughout various parts of the University, only employees deemed “essential/critical” to operations will be required to report for work Wednesday.
 
Employees who do fall under the “essential/critical” classification but can work from home “are strongly encouraged to do so,” University Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp wrote in a message. Other employees do not have to come to work, though they will be paid.
 
According to University spokesman Kevin Galvin, some examples of essential or critical staff include emergency response and public safety personnel, transportation services employees, dining services staff, custodial services staff, building maintenance and repair workers, utilities operations staff, and staff involved in storm-related operations.
 The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences "does not expect individuals to come to work" unless if they are essential to school operations, according to a message sent on behalf of SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray.
The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study will be closed.
 
According to its website, Harvard University Health Services will be closed Wednesday with the exception of urgent care, which will be operating on the third floor from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
 
Additionally, the Office of Career Services’ On-Campus Interview program announced that it has postponed its Jan. 12 deadline for applications to internships at firms such as Barclays Capital, Goldman Sachs, and J.P. Morgan by 24 hours, noting that there will not be drop-ins or counseling appointments while—"for what may be the first time in Harvard history," it said in an e-mail—OCS is closed due to the storm.
 
Harvard has been known to remain reluctant to cancel school on account of snow. Former Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III told The Crimson in reference to a 1977 blizzard that “Harvard University will close only for an act of God, such as the end of the world.”
