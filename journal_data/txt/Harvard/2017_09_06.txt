After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Midwest is full of Good People. However unrealistic it may be, scenes of a quaint and wholesome society, removed from the hectic, harsh truth of coastline cities, characterize the region’s public image. Residents of states like Kansas, Ohio, and Nebraska are considered—if considered at all—mostly benign, maybe a little out of touch, and ultimately inconsequential to the rest of the country.
Still, there exists a belief in the Midwest as the last preserve of a simpler, friendlier, perhaps greater time in America that probably never really existed. Midwesterners take pride in this. They have to. Without bustling cities or scenic beaches, Iowans and Oklahomans and South Dakotans take solace in the moral decency of their hometowns. And while the Midwest frequently falls victim to the ridicule of New Yorkers and Californians, some of them hold this sentiment too—especially conservatives.
Before 2016, Republican candidates championed wholesome “family values,” a two-word catch-all for an agenda backing traditional marriage, pro-life causes, and Bible-based beliefs. Conservatives boasted an understanding of hard work as a tenet of dignified life, especially in areas with high employment in physically demanding industries such as farming or manufacturing. The adage “Pull yourself up by the bootstraps” roots itself in Midwestern values and comes straight out of the Republican playbook.
These conservative principles find their utopia in the Midwest. The region holds the largest share of white Catholics and evangelical Protestants in the country, the most stringent laws on abortion, and some of the most anxiety over gay marriage’s legalization. The last family-run farms exist primarily in the Great Plains, exemplifying a now-ancient but still-revered American ideal of self-sufficiency and unglamorous but honorable work. These people don’t necessarily vote for candidates in whom they see themselves, but who see and respect them—politicians who claim to understand a good work ethic and commend Midwesterners for having one.
Trump’s campaign seized the reins of this ethic and rode it to the presidency. Though it’s typical for Republican presidential candidates to focus on the Midwest, Trump especially spoke to and about Rust Belt states—he complimented their people, cities, and culture; promised economic rebuilding; and vowed to return Washington’s faith in the region. Even though Trump possesses no Midwestern heritage, lacks the humility this demographic typically favors, and didn’t climb to the top of the business world through hard work, he made the region feel as though he did. At the very least, he made them feel like he respected those that did. It unsurprisingly appealed to disgruntled middle-class conservatives in these states, but it reached further than that too.
Political writers and pundits realized the reaching power of Trump’s words, and one June 2016 article published in The New Yorker commented on the effectiveness of Trump’s Midwest-centric strategy. The “long tradition of seeing the Midwest as decent and innocent,” it said, gave Americans a moral obligation to save the region from real or perceived economic turmoil. The region sports an image of both childlike purity and hardworking nobility, making its rescue compulsory. What can Americans stand for if not the most virtuous of us?
But Trump extrapolated this falsified tale of Midwestern woe until it became threatening to the rest of the country. The narrative wasn’t just about saving the last innocent piece of America from a corrupting coming-of-age: It was about making sure it couldn’t happen anywhere else. Trump’s underlying message, though perhaps unintentional, was that crisis and hardship can affect even the most wholesome region of the United States. Invoking fear and exaggerating immediacy, he made voters in and outside of the Midwest more vulnerable to his ideology.
For decades the Midwest represented the dawn of the American dream; now, it represents the American nightmare. Immigrants settled in barely domesticated hamlets in the plains and eventually created successful societies where even the poorest felt the promise of unlimited potential and prosperity. Today, this pillar of American ideology stands damaged and crumbling. The region now serves as the epicenter of feelings of cultural ostracization—grounded in anxiety and misperception—that enabled the current political atmosphere. But some pieces of the Midwestern illusion remain, and Trump’s allure is felt the strongest by those who are both the most convinced of this image and the most fearful of its demise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Tuesday morning, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Trump administration will rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, an initiative created by former president Barack Obama in a 2012 executive order. It granted undocumented youth, under certain conditions, protection from deportation and the ability to apply for work permits. University President Drew G. Faust, in an email to Harvard affiliates, called the decision an implementation of a “cruel policy [that] recognizes neither justice nor mercy.”
President Faust’s support for undocumented students—both through years of lobbying in Washington, D.C., and her recent letter to President Trump in support of DACA—is important and worth commending. But since the future of students who have previously benefited from DACA is now uncertain, President Faust and the University must ramp up their efforts to support these students and other undocumented students who did not qualify.
First, stable employment made possible by DACA curbed the exploitation of a portion of undocumented workers and gave undocumented college students a way of using their degrees after graduation. If their ability to work is taken away after DACA expires in March, Harvard must ensure that undocumented students are supported financially. In tandem with the Financial Aid Office and the Office for International Education, the College must ensure that undocumented students have the financial security that will allow them to take advantage of the educational experience that Harvard promises, even if they lose their work permits and are not able to provide these funds for themselves.
Second, the central tenet of DACA was deferred action from deportation. Once this ends, the fear of deportation that pains immigrant communities nationwide will be palpable for undocumented students on campus. Mental health cases relating to general anxieties about citizenship status will likely skyrocket, so it is also imperative that Harvard hire more mental health specialists who are specifically trained to work with undocumented communities.
Currently, there is only one mental health counselor at Counseling and Mental Health Services who was involved with the support group for undocumented students last semester. Hiring new counselors whose area of expertise is undocumented communities will be a critical step in addressing the the inevitable mental health issues that will accompany a repeal of DACA.
Additionally, the University will have to increase the legal support available to undocumented students. Since Trump’s election, lawyers at the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic have been working to offer free legal advice to undocumented Harvard students. Unfortunately, only one lawyer has been put in place for undocumented and DACAmented students, but a single person is not sufficient. In many cases, students fear for the safety of their families as well as their own, affecting them just as much as a fear of their own deportation. Hiring more lawyers and administrations at the clinic would enable it to keep up with increased demand.
In these times, it would be easy hold up students who benefit from DACA as the models or exceptions for being undocumented. That would be a mistake. Instead, we must remember that this is about the undocumented community as a whole and that these DACA students would be nothing without the parents that still continue to be criminalized and blamed for bringing them to the United States.
All DACA recipients should be here, but no undocumented individuals should be deported. As we have said before, deportation is a human rights issue, and no individual should be subjected to the inhumane conditions deportation proceedings foster. Any undocumented Harvard affiliate, including faculty, administrators, and staff, should benefit from the services that the University should provide.
Finally, President Faust must continue in her efforts to lobby in Washington, D.C. Throughout her tenure as President, she has supported both the DREAM Act and DACA. Faust must double-down on her efforts to publicly support legislation that would help undocumented students, and Harvard’s lobbying offices in D.C. should prioritize pushing Congress to work on new immigration reform measures. When new bills designed to support undocumented students are introduced, the president of the University must be vocal about backing it.
Given the decades long debate about immigration reform, it is clear that these issues will not be solved or finalized before Drew Faust’s term ends. This means that the presidential search committee must ensure that their candidates will preserve Faust’s commitment to undocumented students, both on campus and in Washington, D.C. By selecting an individual who will be a staunch advocate for undocumented students, the search committee can ensure that support for these Harvard affiliates and their families continues to improve.
If Harvard wants to be an institution where undocumented students can thrive, its leaders must be supportive, both vocally and in their actions. We ask that the administration continue to make it clear that undocumented students are welcome here, including as the Admissions Office conducts outreach. These students are a critical part of this nation’s fabric, and Harvard has a responsibility to continue their work in making that clear—to those on campus, to those across the nation, and to those with the power to effect change.

On September 6, Harvard alumnus Charles A. Murray ’65 will, upon invitation by the Harvard College Open Campus Initiative, appear on campus for a talk on his most recent book. Dr. Murray is a well-known sociologist who has written various books on sociology, education, and IQ. We, the Undergraduate Council’s Black Caucus, believe Murray’s blatantly white supremacist theories on race, gender, class, and IQ are fundamentally dangerous.
For the Open Campus Initiative to invite Murray to campus and give him an unchecked platform from which he can participate in and legitimize a tradition of dehumanization of marginalized people—the same tradition that is responsible for the tragedy of Charlottesville (and America’s entire history of racial trauma)—is fundamentally at odds with who we should be as a College. We believe that this event is misguided, and urge Open Campus Initiative to cancel it.
A common thread in Murray’s theories about social welfare, intelligence, and innate ability is an assertion of the natural intellectual and moral inferiority of certain disadvantaged groups of people—notably, as the Southern Poverty Law Center writes, “the Black and Latino communities, women, and the poor”—and the superiority of the white male upper class. This, according to the SPLC, earns him the label of white nationalist. We agree.
SPLC writes that “According to Murray, the relative differences between the white and black populations of the United States, as well as those between men and women, have nothing to do with discrimination or historical and structural disadvantages, but rather stem from genetic differences between the groups.” We fail to see how arguing that we, as black students, suffer from innate genetic differences that make us naturally inferior to our white peers is anything but white supremacy.
We acknowledge that these critiques of Murray are most applicable to his earlier work, notably “The Bell Curve.” Open Campus Initiative would argue that they, of course, did not have white supremacist ideologies in mind when they planned this event. But this misses the point. Murray’s ideology is white nationalism and has always been white nationalism. He has never rejected the claims he makes in “The Bell Curve.” Open Campus Initiative invited a white nationalist to campus, and they cannot control what he chooses to bring up in his talk. To assume that race, gender, and class will not ground everything that is discussed during this event is to forget who Charles Murray is. His entire ideology is tainted by white nationalism.
Murray would most likely protest that white supremacy is an unfair characterization of his beliefs: He would argue that he is just dealing with the facts. This mistakenly ignores that he is part of a troubling historical trend of backing bigoted claims with tainted data. Charles Lane argues that, in essence, Murray’s ideology is  a rehashing of the philosophies of white supremacist eugenics. These philosophies have already been revealed at length to be fundamentally biased science that are anything but conclusive. Murray is not dealing with the facts. He is twisting the facts by presupposing a certain interpretation of them, one that completely overlooks the influences of racist social and political institutions on individual “success,” however that is measured.
At this political moment, when the very humanity of people of color in this country is being questioned and white supremacy is at the forefront of American political discourse, students ought to stand with their vulnerable peers of color and other marginalized persons on this campus. Instead, OCI has invited someone whose ideology fundamentally threatens their lives and freedoms. How can we begin to foster a sense of belonging and inclusion for these groups on this campus while inviting people who call into question their intelligence, worth, and humanity? We believe that doing both is impossible. As such, this event is a mistake.
We are calling on OCI to cancel this event. In the very likely circumstance that the event continues regardless, we will be hosting our own event during Murray’s talk, which will consist of a panel of experts on sociology and race theory who will provide an in-depth explanation of where Murray goes wrong. We urge students to be proactive inquirers, and to challenge the ideology that Murray represents by joining us at Northwest Labs, Room 103 at 6:30 p.m. for the panel discussion, and at 5:45 p.m. outside the Harvard Natural History Museum to rally the community.
At this moment in our history, we need to decide once and for all what values we as a community hold dear, and what side of history we fall on. In inviting Charles Murray to campus, OCI has asserted that white supremacy is a valid ideology, and that it belongs in our community. For the sake of the communities we are a part of, we stand firmly in opposition. Charles Murray does not belong here.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 5, 2017 at 10:58 p.m.
President Donald Trump ended an Obama-era program that protects undocumented youth Tuesday, drawing the swift condemnation of several Harvard administrators.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions publicly announced President Donald Trump’s much-awaited decision on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program at a morning press conference at the Justice Department. Tuesday marked a deadline 10 states imposed on the Trump administration to end DACA, or else face a legal challenge, and Trump asked Congress to take legislative action before the program expires in March 2018.
“This cruel policy recognizes neither justice nor mercy,” Faust wrote in an email to Harvard affiliates of the decision. “In the months to come, we will make every effort to have our voice heard, in the halls of Congress and elsewhere, about the need for the protections of DACA to continue.”
The program, put in place by former President Barack Obama via executive order in 2012, provides work authorizations and protected status to undocumented young people who arrived in the U.S. at a young age. It allows around 790,000 youth to work and go to school without fear of deportation, including several dozen Harvard students.
In recent weeks, as the Tuesday deadline loomed, immigrant rights advocates, hundreds of U.S. CEOs, and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have implored Trump to preserve the program. University President Drew G. Faust—a vocal advocate for undocumented students—sent a letter to Trump defending DACA last week.
Approximately 65 undocumented students attend Harvard, according to Katie M. Derzon, the Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion’s fellow for undocumented students. Since Trump’s election, the University has ramped up resources for undocumented students—hiring Derzon and a full-time attorney at the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic at the Law School, bringing immigration law experts to campus to provide legal consultations, and circulating memos with guidance for undocumented students, among other measures.
With an announcement nearing, resident deans sent messages over House lists on Monday evening outlining these resources and expressing support for undocumented students.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana decried Trump’s move in an email to undergraduates Tuesday afternoon. “In ending this program, this nation has taken a step backwards,” he wrote. “Today, the futures of these young people—including those Harvard College students who benefit from the DACA program—are in jeopardy.”
Addressing those “now grappling with uncertainty” after Trump’s announcement, Khurana wrote, “know this: Harvard College supports you.”
In her statement Tuesday, Faust also pointed to a 24-hour hotline for undocumented Harvard affiliates and a weekly support group offered by Harvard University Health Services’ Counseling and Mental Health Services.
The Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic held an information session Tuesday afternoon to answer questions on the implications of the policy change. Derzon wrote in an email that she is encouraging all undocumented students to reach out to HIRC for a consultation.
According to guidelines for “winding down the program” issued by the Department of Homeland Security Tuesday, current DACA documents will remain valid until their expiration dates. The department will continue to process pending applications, as well as applications for renewals it receives before Oct. 5. It won’t, however, process first-time DACA applications.
If a student’s DACA status expires—and they are no longer legally permitted to remain in the country—deportation won’t happen immediately, according to Jason Corral, the designated attorney for undocumented students in the law clinic. Students would first have to be placed in formal removal proceedings before facing deportation.
Earlier this year, Harvard University Police Department Chief Francis D. Riley sent a message to University affiliates pledging that his officers would not inquire about immigration statuses or help with federal immigration enforcement.
But Harvard’s ability to shield its undocumented population does have a limit. Federal authorities are permitted to enter the campus with a valid warrant.
Some immigration rights advocates have raised concerns that by handing over personal details to receive DACA status, DACA recipients have unwittingly given the federal government the information it needs to go after them once the program is terminated.
“I think it is reasonable to be concerned about that,” Law School professor Gerald L. Neuman said. “I think there are legal arguments about whether that can be done or not, and there may be lawsuits about whether the government can do this if it tries.”
Corral said he interpreted the guidance issued by the Department of Homeland Security to mean that information submitted by DACA applications won’t be shared with immigration enforcement authorities for deportation purposes—but, he wrote, “it is really unclear on that point.”
Trump’s decision effectively places the fate of undocumented youth in the United States in the hands of Congress. Faust told Harvard affiliates that she wrote to leaders in both the Senate and the House of Representatives Tuesday, urging them to pass either the DREAM Act or the BRIDGE Act—two pieces of legislation that would codify protections for DACA-eligible people.
“Harvard has long advocated in Washington, DC, for these vulnerable students, and we will continue to work tirelessly at the federal level to advance our arguments,” Faust wrote to affiliates.
If Congress takes action, Neuman said “DREAMers” could potentially find themselves in a more secure position six months from now than they were under DACA. “The next question after today is going to be, will Congress finally pass a law that gives stable legal status on a statutory basis for the Dreamers?”
But, he added, “the odds of good things coming out of Congress right now are difficult to predict.”

Corey R. Lewandowski, President Donald Trump’s embattled former campaign advisor, will join the Institute of Politics as a visiting fellow this semester, the IOP announced Tuesday.
Lewandowski and the other visiting fellows, including the former president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the former governor of Kentucky, will each host several events for students on campus throughout the fall semester. The five new visiting fellows join “Morning Joe” co-hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, who were named IOP fellows over the summer.
Cornell William Brooks, who served as president and CEO of the NAACP until 2017, will direct the IOP”s Campaigns and Advocacy Program in addition to his role as a visiting fellow.
Rounding out the slate of visiting fellows are former Kentucky Governor Steven L. Beshear, conservative writers Mary Katharine Ham and Guy Benson, and media consultant Joe Slade White, who previously worked for former Vice President Joe Biden.
“This diverse group of policymakers, journalists, political advisors and activists provides a robust platform for dynamic interaction with our students and the larger Harvard community,” IOP Acting Director Bill Delahunt said of the fellows in a press release.
Lewandowski rose to prominence during the 2016 presidential election as an early and divisive aide to then-presidential candidate Trump. Under pressure from top donors and Republican officials, and after Lewandowski was charged with misdemeanor battery for his alleged handling of a reporter, Trump fired Lewandowski in June 2016. He now works as a political commentator and consultant.
The visiting fellows join six residential IOP fellows—including former Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz and chief correspondent at The Washington Post Dan Balz—announced last month. The IOP will host an event on “protests, partisanship, and fixing politics” featuring the residential fellows Thursday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge Police Department is investigating two shootings that occurred roughly three blocks from the Central Square MBTA Station Tuesday morning and prompted the brief closure of a Harvard-affiliated day care center.
CPD responded to reports of gunshots around 10:46 a.m. near the intersection of River and Auburn Streets, according to a press release. The victims, two men, sustained nonfatal injuries and were provided treatment at local hospitals. One was wounded in the knee and the other sustained a gunshot to the hand.
Currently, the police believe that the incident was targeted and that there is “no threat to the public’s safety,” according to the press release. The targeted nature of the attack has led the department to believe that the shootings are unrelated to a pair of stabbings in Harvard Square that occurred over Labor Day weekend. 
“I think this morning’s incident, the victims were targeted, meaning there was a prior relationship, but once again it’s so early on in the investigation that anything is conjecture and speculation,’’ CPD commissioner Branville G. Bard, Jr. said in a press conference shortly after the attack. “It’s very unlikely that they’re related incidents.”
Certain Cambridge schools, including the Harvard-affiliated Radcliffe Child Care Center at 10 DeWolfe Street, were put on lockdown status Tuesday morning after the shootings, CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick wrote in an email. The schools were cleared shortly after the lockdown was put in place.
“The children’s daily routines have not been disrupted. All have enjoyed their lunches and are settling in for their naps,” the director of the center wrote  in an email to parents.
Streets in the vicinity of the shooting were also closed briefly, according to the press release, and police have since seized a red automobile that was seen fleeing the scene of the attack. Reports also indicated a man on a white bicycle was seen leaving the scene.
CPD also reported Tuesday afternoon that a man was non-fatally stabbed in Central Square, blocks from where the shooting had occurred that morning. CPD arrested a suspect in connection with the stabbing later that afternoon.

A University-wide task force on inclusion and belonging is set to release recommendations one semester earlier than planned, according to Government professor Danielle S. Allen, one of the task force’s co-chairs.
Formed in 2016, the body was initially set to work through spring 2018. Instead, Allen said the task force will submit a report to University President Drew G. Faust by the end of the fall semester.
Task force member and Undergraduate Council Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 said Faust’s decision to step down from her post in June precipitated the change in schedule.
“[Faust] was really the impetus behind this task force,” Khansarinia said. “The task force reports directly to her. She has a huge stake in this game and she really believes in it. I think the task force chairpeople really wanted to deliver something to her desk before she leaves the presidency.” 
William Oh ’18, another member of the task force, also said the possibility of a new president changed the group’s calculus.
“The two options I think the task force is faced with is either speed up or significantly slow down,” Oh said. “With the original timeline, there is a lot of uncertainty in the sense that we don’t know who the next Harvard president is and, if this report is completed by the original timeline, the report will be the first thing to land on that new president’s desk.”
Faced with an earlier deadline, the task force must speed up its deliberation process. They will meet at a retreat on Sept. 9 to come to a consensus on their various findings, according to Vice President of Campus Services and task force co-chair Meredith L. Weenick.
“We are all convening for the whole day to discuss preliminary recommendations and really flesh out the solutions,” Oh said. “The general consensus is that we are intending to speed up the work to hopefully complete it by the winter or have it ready by early next spring.”
In the announcement of the task force’s formation, Faust defined four areas of focus for the group—demographics, institutional culture, academic resources, and existing diversity organizations at Harvard. Weenick summarized Faust’s charge as working “not only bring people together from diverse perspectives and backgrounds”, but also “to make sure that people can really participate to the best for their ability and have all the elements to their success and therefore our collective success.”
Since its formation, the task force has worked to gather information through surveys, school-wide data sets, and “on-site sessions with leadership teams,” according to Weenick. The task force also solicits recommendations through a “solution space” on their website.
In April, at an event billed “Afternoon of Engagement on Inclusion and Belonging,” the task force drew attention—and some criticism—for announcing the replacement of the last line of “Fair Harvard,” the University’s 181-year-old alma mater.
Although the final recommendations are still in flux, Oh said he hopes the task force releases recommendations that can address all of a “decentralized Harvard.”
“I would call the work of a task force a success if ... we are able to update the University’s structures... to be able to respond to the needs of the different constituencies of the university: faculty, staff, students,” he said.

CVS closed its location at 1426 Massachusetts Ave. this summer, leaving just one location of the drug store location in Harvard Square.
For more than two years, Cantabrigians and University affiliates in search of drug store merchandise had faced a choice: spend their money at the 1426 Mass. Ave. CVS or patronize its newer, larger counterpart roughly 100 yards away at 6 JFK St.
CVS announced plans for the 6 JFK St. location in January 2015. At the time of the announcement the drug store chain already operated two Harvard Square branches: one at 29 JFK St. and the other on Mass. Ave. The 29 JFK St. location closed shortly after the announcement.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said she was not surprised by the Mass. Ave. location’s closing.
“I think that it was clear from the beginning when they opened the new CVS,” she said.
She highlighted cleanliness, the MinuteClinic, 24-hour schedule, and a selection of on-the-go prepared food as the main features that set the newer CVS apart.
“Having two CVSs within just a couple of hundred yards of each other probably doesn’t make sense,” she added.
CVS spokesperson Stephanie Cunha wrote in an email that the company had “always planned” to have just one Harvard Square location.
“Our new store that remains is a more convenient location that offers our full suite of services for the Harvard community—including pharmacy, beauty service, photo service, as well as our full mix of front store offerings,” Cunha wrote.
Maged Naguib, who manages the now only CVS in Harvard Square, at 6 JFK St., said he has noticed an uptick in business at his branch since the store across the street closed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The faculty committee that proposed a ban on social groups at Harvard continued its deliberations last week as it considers revisions to its initial proposal, according to three individuals with direct knowledge of the event.
The committee met on Sept. 1, roughly two months after it released a 22-page preliminary report recommending that the College forbid students from joining all “fraternities, sororities, and similar organizations”—including co-ed groups—with the goal of eliminating these organizations from campus entirely by May 2022.
The committee’s discussions seemed slated to end last semester; in an email sent to members on May 2, committee co-chair and Music professor Suzannah E. Clark called a gathering held on May 26 “our final meeting.” And Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith in late April 2017 denied a member’s request to extend the body’s work into the fall semester.
But amid renewed criticism from professors and the threats of lawsuits, the committee, which is set to release a final report later in the fall, has started meeting again. At the Friday gathering, members examined a set of new documents not previously reviewed by the committee, according to one member granted anonymity by The Crimson to discuss confidential committee proceedings. The committee plans to meet again after holding three drop-in faculty-only discussion sessions on Sept 11., Sept. 14, and Sept. 15.
Administrators announced the formation of the committee in January 2017 and charged it with re-evaluating Harvard’s penalties on members of social groups. Starting with the Class of 2021, these sanctions bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from certain fellowships, student leadership positions, and athletic team captaincies.
Committee co-chairs Clark and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday evening.
Over the course of last semester, the committee—composed of faculty, students, and administrators—met every few weeks in different buildings across campus, usually on Friday mornings, to debate the future of Harvard’s social group policy.
On May 12, roughly a month before it released its preliminary report, the committee conducted a straw poll vote on ten options ranging from the social group ban to cancelling Harvard’s efforts to regulate undergraduate social life. The Crimson later reported that the proposed ban received just seven votes from the committee, making it the third-most popular option considered.
Shortly before publication of The Crimson’s article in late July, committee leadership sent an email to members discussing the forthcoming story and condemning what they viewed as a breach of the body’s strict confidentiality policy, according to two members.
That policy forbids members from bringing phones to committee meetings last semester and instructs them not to speak to the press, except to describe their own comments made during meetings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of Harvard affiliates and Cambridge residents gathered in front of Memorial Church Tuesday to protest President Donald Trump's decision to rescind protections for undocumented young people.
Hosted by student immigration advocacy group Act on a Dream, the “Fight for Immigrant Rights” rally featured student speakers from across the University affected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program or with undocumented family members. Chanting “up, up with liberation; down, down with deportation,” the crowd filled about three quarters of Tercentenary Theatre.
“DACA gave me a peace of mind that meant I didn’t have to worry about myself,” said Laura S. Veira-Ramirez ’20, a DACA recipient. “I could focus on worrying about my parents and the rest of my community, because I was safe.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Tuesday morning that the administration would end DACA, an Obama-era program that provides protection for children of undocumented immigrants, in six months. The program allows roughly 800,000 undocumented young people to remain and work in the United States.
For some speakers at the rally, the decision was personal. Bruno O. Villegas McCubbin ’19, a member of Act on a Dream, reflected on the sacrifices his immigrant parents had made to raise him in the United States.
“To [my mother] and my dad, DACA was an indication, one of the few indications, that they had ultimately done the right thing coming here and that all their sacrifices were worth it,” McCubbin said. “Now, it just feels like a huge step back.”
In an email to Harvard affiliates shortly after Sessions’ announcement, University President Drew G. Faust affirmed the University’s commitment to protecting its “DREAMers” and outlined a number of legal and counseling services for undocumented students. At the rally, Jason M. Corral—a staff attorney at the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program—reiterated that undocumented students should take advantage of the resources available to them.
“This is not the end. Now we fight…now we need a permanent fix,” Corral said after the event. “I’m looking to talk to individuals that are concerned on a personal level to see if there is some kind of legal remedy that can go beyond DACA.”
Still, several speakers and attendees called on Harvard to go further and declare the University a “sanctuary campus.” Faust has previously refused to do so, citing concerns that the label would draw unwanted and dangerous attention to undocumented students while providing no legal protection.
“We would like to see that happen. We would like to see stronger protections, legal protections,” said Alec J. Fischthal ’21, who attended the rally.
Beyond the student body, speakers also called upon Harvard to take actions to protect faculty, workers, and their families.
“We must remember that it took a great amount of activist pressure to get DACA,” Veira-Ramirez said. “We must remember that people fought for it and risked deportation… so my activism doesn’t end because I will no longer be protected and yours shouldn’t either.”
As for Act on a Dream, its board—which has doubled in size since last year, according to co-director Daishi M. Tanaka ’18—plans to up its efforts reaching out to legislators through call-a-thons and canvassing.
“What’s next for us is fighting for immigrant rights as we usually do,” Tanaka said. “I think a lot of social justice organizations suffer from the problem of being too reactionary, but our mission has been the same from the start and it won’t change and we will continue to work.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School unveiled a memorial dedicated to slaves owned by the Royall family, whose donations helped endow the institution, at an event Tuesday evening.
The plaque, which sits on a rock in the plaza between Langdell Hall and the Caspersen Student Center, reads, “In honor of the enslaved whose labor created wealth that made possible the founding of Harvard Law School. May we pursue the highest ideals of law and justice in their memory.”
University President Drew G. Faust, newly appointed Dean of the Law School John F. Manning, and Law School professors Annette Gordon-Reed and Janet E. Halley each spoke at the dedication.
The plaque marks the second time Harvard has memorialized its historical ties to slavery in recent years. In 2016, Faust dedicated a plaque on Wadsworth Hall to the four enslaved people who lived and worked there in the 18th century. The Law School has also grappled with its connections to the Royall family in the past when it removed the family’s crest as its official seal; it has yet to select a new one.
The new plaque does not include the names of the enslaved persons. Gordon-Reed, who drafted the memorial’s text, said that the omission of names was meant to remember the anonymity of slavery.
“The words are designed to invoke all of their spirits and bring them into our minds and into our memories, in the hopes that it will spur us to try to bring to the world what was not given to them—the law’s protection and regard, and justice,” Gordon-Reed said.
Manning’s speech remarked on the significance of beginning the school’s 2017 bicentennial celebrations with the memorial and recognizing slavery’s central role in the Law School’s history.
“We start our bicentennial today with this dedication and this tribute, and we place this memorial here, at the crossroads, at the very center of this school, where everyone travels, where everyone passes, so that it cannot be missed,” Manning said.
Adrian D. Perkins, a member of the school’s student government, said seeing the monument gave him “profound happiness” as a student leader and African American student. He said the student government is planning a number of ways to address racial concerns on campus this year.
“In years past, there would be something that would jump up in our larger community in America and the student body would have to react to it, but this year we have instances like this where we lay out this great monument,” Perkins said. “We’re also going to be hosting town halls alongside the administration where students can talk about any issues that arise before this very negative thing sparks the crises that we’ve had on campus in past years.”
The memorial event was preceded by a talk on the founding and first 50 years of Harvard Law School, given by Daniel R. Coquillette, a professor at Boston College and visiting professor at the Law School, who has published a book on the history of the school. It included a panel with talks from Law School professors Gordon-Reed, Halley, Randall Kennedy, and Bruce H. Mann.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Institute of Politics kicked off the fall semester Tuesday evening with a panel discussion of six Kennedy School professors, who debated whether or not democracy is threatened in modern times.
The panel, moderated by Kennedy School lecturer Nicco Mele,  brought together scholars from across departments and areas of interest to answer one particular question: “Are democracies in peril?”
Kennedy School lecturer Marshall L. Ganz ’64-92 said he agreed that modern democracy is in danger. Ganz left Harvard as an undergraduate in the 60s to help organize farm workers with Cesar Chavez and returned to finish his degree decades later.
Ganz added that democracy had been threatened by recent Supreme Court decisions about campaign finance that have hindered the ability for effective social movements.
“I think the whole way in which wealth has come to dominate the whole political process...they’re turned into marketing operations, not organizing. So the world of politics, which is getting people to engage with each other… doesn’t get done,” he said.
Professor Jane J. Mansbridge argued that a recent rise populism signaled weaknesses of democracy and that populist thought is a response to a disregard of “economic losers.”
Kennedy School professor Khalil Gibran Muhammad said at the event that he thought democracy must be reworked to include marginalized groups such as immigrants. Muhammad also appears in the recent documentary “13th,” which discusses mass incarceration in the United States.
“A new civic culture must take seriously the creation of a new origin story for America… immigrants must be welcomed with greater intentionality into the fold of this history,” he said.
Meghan L. O'Sullivan, a senior fellow at the Kennedy School’s Belfer Center and Deputy National Security Advisor for Iraq and Afghanistan under former President George W. Bush, said she was “optimistic” that liberal democracy is not in crisis. She instead pointed to political parties as declining.
“I don’t see an actual and vibrant debate about whether or not liberal democracy is the best form of government for this country,” O’Sullivan said, “I would not say that we are having a crisis of liberal democracy. I would say that we are having a real crisis in our political parties.”
Kennedy School professor Kathryn Sikkink pointed out that the number of democratically-ruled countries had risen in the past 50 years, arguing that a larger trend of democracy is likely here to stay.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After capturing its first outright Ivy League title since 1990 last season, the No. 20 Harvard field hockey team entered 2017 with high hopes. Its new campaign kicked off this weekend as the Crimson battled sweltering heat and got the best of two of its three opponents in California.
“The heat was definitely something we didn’t expect, but we were ready,” sophomore midfielder Bente van Vlijmen said. “Our staff was very prepared. We were hydrated and there were wet towels everywhere, but we still had to push and it was tough. But after a while we got into the game and the heat didn't bother us much until after the game had ended.”
The Crimson (2-1) opened its weekend slate by beating UC Davis (0-3) on Friday and No. 25 University of the Pacific (1-2) on Saturday. Harvard closed the weekend by facing off with its toughest opponent, No. 13 Stanford. In a close contest, the team eventually dropped its first game of the season to the Cardinal (3-2) in a shootout.
No. 13 Stanford, 2, No. 20 Harvard,1
In the team’s toughest matchup of the weekend, Harvard conceded the first goal of the contest to the hosts, as senior midfielder Sarah Helgeson tipped in a cross in the 47th minute. Stanford sophomore goalkeeper Kelsey Bing managed to stop many of the Crimson’s early efforts, but the team was finally able to break through in the 70th minute.
After earning a penalty corner in the final minute, van Vlijmen fired the initial shot, which senior midfielder Hannah Wellington tipped just inside the net for the score. Neither team managed to break through in overtime, sending the game into a shootout which the Crimson eventually dropped 3-2 to the Cardinal.
“After the game, we held our heads high” senior goalkeeper Olivia Startup said. “We thought we performed really well because we competed with one of the top teams in the country. We thought it was a great testament to how strong Harvard field hockey has become.”
No. 20 Harvard 5, No. 25 University of the Pacific 3
On Saturday, the Crimson rode a strong defensive performance for the second straight day to secure the victory. Trailing 1-0, freshman forward Mimi Tarrant continued her strong start to the season, scoring 15 minutes in to even the score. Minutes later, sophomore midfielder Maddie Earle scored following a scramble in front of the net.
Freshman back Hannah Pearce doubled the lead for the Crimson and pushed it to three in the 60th minute. The goals were Pearce’s first two of her collegiate career. However, the Tigers wouldn’t be denied, as the hosts scored two goals in quick succession to close the gap to one.
Van Vlijmen put to rest any hopes of a comeback, however, by scoring in the 69th minute. The goal was her second in as many days to start the season.
“We were pretty confident when we first started the game” van Vlijmen said. “We were really good at finding each other on the field and once we get into a flow, we feel as though we’re unstoppable. I feel as though that really showed through the first two games”.
No. 20 Harvard 3, UC Davis 0
Much of the Crimson’s success in 2016 came from strong defensive efforts, and the team’s defensive ability continued into its first matchup of this season against UC Davis. Harvard outshot its hosts, 19-0, accumulating 12 shots on goal.
In the second minute of the game, the Crimson scored its first goal as junior forward Kathleen Young found the back of the net. Just ten minutes later, Harvard saw its lead double. In the 22nd minute, senior midfielder Ellie Cookson saw her shot get deflected but Tarrant was able to secure the rebound and score her first career collegiate goal.
In the second half, the Crimson saw its leading scorer from last season—van Vlijmen—score the game’s third and final goal off of a penalty corner with 14:14 left to play. With the victory, Harvard improved to 4-2 in season opening contests under coach Tjerk van Herwaarden and 29-13-2 since 1974.
“I think one of our greatest strengths is that we have depth across the board” Startup said. “We’re a team where everyone has a chance to play and it really takes the entire team to secure these wins. We have a lot of great individuals but we know we’re strongest as a team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Opening their 2017 campaigns, the Harvard men’s and women’s cross country teams competed in a dual meet against local rival Boston College at the Chestnut Hill Reservoir on Friday afternoon.
Running two laps around the 1.56 mile reservoir, the men's team beat Boston College, 31-24, while the women's team fell, 50-15. However, since the meet occured before the NCAA qualifying window, the results will not have an impact on either team's standing for the season.
For the Crimson men’s team, senior Louis Colson and junior Collin Price took the race’s top two times, beating all of Boston College with matching 15:54.5 times. For Colson, Friday’s victory marks his first career win in cross country. As runner up, Price also recorded his best collegiate finish.
On the women’s side, all of the competing Harvard runners ran together, led by captain Elianna Shwayder, a U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association All-Region honoree, and finished as a cohesive group with a time of 11:16.
“The BC dual was a fun opportunity to run a workout together as a group,” Shwayder said. “We kept everyone together and ran a specific pace.”
Freshman Abbe Goldstein, sophomore Gillian Meeks, freshman Tessa Medrano, senior Fiona Davis, and freshman Anna Juul all competed for the Crimson.
"The BC meet was fairly relaxed, but our group of girls ran together and looked strong. We've had some quality training during our pre-season time back on campus,” said Junior Malia Ellington. “We are excited for our season, especially the meets at our home course, Franklin Park."
Looking ahead, the Harvard cross country teams will officially kick off the season in New Haven on  Sept. 15th. The Crimson will travel to compete in the annual Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet hosted this year by the Bulldogs on the Course at Yale.
Last fall, the Harvard women’s team won the 2016 Ivy League Heptagonal Championship. This season, three of its top five scorers return to compete for the Crimson, prepared to continue leaving their mark on the collegiate running scene.
Senior Courtney Smith and sophomore Judy Pendergast will both be running in the Pac-12 Conference this season for Stanford and Oregon, respectively, after transferring.
Last season, Shwayder, in addition to being named to the USTFCCCA All-Region team, was apick for the All-Ivy League second team, placing 12th at the Ivy League Heptagonal Cross Country Championships and finishing eighth at the Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet. She will be a key runner for the team once again this year.
Other top scorers to look out for this season include junior Erin Dietz, who finished fifth at Heps a season ago and was named All-Ivy League first team, as well as sophomore Lisa Tertsch, who is expected to build on her strong freshman campaign, during which she placed ninth at Heps and was named All-Ivy League second team.
For the men, junior co-captain Kieran Tuntivate, who crossed the finish line at Heps in 18th place and was also named a USTFCCCA All-Region select, is expected to lead the team both on and off the course. Another key returner for the Crimson is sophomore Will Battershill, who looks to continue building on his standout freshman campaign last spring in which he finished third at the IC4A/ECAC Championships in the 3,000-meter steeplechase.
The Harvard women’s team enters the 2017 season ranked No. 25 in the USTFCCCA National Coaches' Poll, and No. 2 in the USTFCCCA Northeast Regional Rankings. Harvard is the highest ranked Ivy League Team, followed by the Yale women’s team, which currently holds the No. 30 spot.

In case you haven't noticed yet, Harvard Square is not what it used to be. It seems like every other week we're screaming RIP after another Square staple randomly shutters. We’ve lost some fan favorites (everything other than Boloco) as well as some places whose presence never made sense (Boloco).
So, where are we supposed to go for all of our shopping needs when we don't want to leave the Harvard Bubble? Lucky for you, w’re experts at adventure—ask us about our study abroad—so we’ve checked out all the options for you.
Pressed Juicery
In case you’re sad about Pinkberry leaving, Pressed is probably close to the same thing. Except, in liquid form. TBH I’ve never been to Pinkberry or even met anyone who ever has, so I do not know what we’re comparing to. But if you’re in the market for a very expensive fruit-themed drink, Pressed seems like the place to be.
Fjällräven Kanken
Do you need a fancy-ass backpack? Want to match all the trendy kids who definitely can’t fit all of their books in their bags? Check out Fjällräven on Church St. And, bonus, you can check out the little Dunks and the empty place that used to be American Apparel. Mostly go to Dunks.
Sweetgreen
Opened last semester, but just a reminder that it is AMAZING. Certainly a bougie option, but if you’re going out to eat, think about checking it out. Finally, a place that makes healthy taste good.
Zambrero
So this technically isn’t open yet, but this is another burrito place opening up in the Square. Fingers crossed these are nectar-of-the-gods level burritos, because there’s no way there’s room for another mediocre burrito place in the Square.
For more info, especially @freshmen, check out our welcome back Cheap Eats series and stay tuned because our only interest on this campus is food.
