The first episode of Amazon Prime Video’s “The Peripheral,” which premiered on Oct. 21, succeeds in drawing viewers into its mysterious, ill-fated, high-tech world. The show’s pilot finds the perfect mix of action and cliff-hangers to provide enough for an enjoyable experience while raising burning questions that must be answered by watching more.
The pilot opens in a strange, futuristic world in 2099. There seem to be pirate ships fighting on a lake and huge towers in the skyline. The audience is introduced to a man and a little girl named Aelita who has some unexplained power. She tells the man, Wilf (Gary Carr), that she is trying to save a world, but not the one they are currently in.
The time then shifts, jumping back over 60 years to the year 2032. The show's protagonist Flynne (Chloë Grace Moretz) lives in a dusty, small town with her ailing mother (Melinda Page Hamilton) and her brother (Jack Reynor), who makes money playing virtual reality video games for rich people. They live in a realistic and modern rural society with the addition of some futuristic technology, especially in the video games. Flynne is especially good at these games, often playing for her brother under his name.
The show’s action kicks off when Flynne’s brother brings home a new virtual reality system that plugs directly into the player's head. Flynne enters the virtual world to earn money, but finds it to be much more exciting than she imagined.
The world inside of the game is exciting, fast, and sleek, pulling the audience into its glossy action and fascinating world full of robots and espionage. The world in the game is not explained. Presented simply as a series of tasks dealing with espionage and deceit, the game features robots that materialize out of thin air, adding toits mystique and rendering it an addictive pastime. Flynn soon finds herself at a party in a mansion filled by the rich and powerful; here, the show entices the audience with stunning visuals that feature a myriad of intriguing characters.
Intrigued by the game, Flynne plays again the next day but finds it totally different. She is confronted with a terrifying and disgusting situation that is difficult to watch, and then gets so hurt in the game that she vomits in real life and is forced to quit. Eventually, Flynne’s present-day reality connects with the pilot’s opening scene, and Flynne is contacted by the man from the future. While the connection between Flynne’s video game and the future is left unexplained in the pilot, its inclusion leaves viewers searching for answers. Moretz’s convincing performance as Flynne elicits empathy about her dilemma, and the pilot’s pacing effectively creates mystery.
Occasionally, the show hits the shadowy connections a little too on-the-nose, which can make its mysteries feel superficial and obvious. Moments that seem initially intriguing when left ambiguous often feel cheesy and pandering when paired with the series’ epic soundtrack and cinematographic choices, like dramatic close-ups and zoom-ins. In one scene, Flynne’s direct discovery when she tells a friend her theories betrays the show’s hand, taking the power out of the interesting, mysterious dynamic it seeks to establish.
Nonetheless, the pilot of “The Peripheral” attracts viewers into a vibrant and action-packed world and introduces the show effectively, leaving questions that feel important and pressing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the evening of Oct. 13, dozens of students filed into Swartz Hall, escaping the rain to attend “Qahwa, Kalam, and Calligraphy,” a program hosted by the Harvard Divinity School. The event highlighted the masterful craft of visual artist Aadil Abedi as he painted in real time alongside poetry recitations from Divinity School students covering a range of Middle Eastern and Southwest Asian languages.
Serving as haven from the stormy gloom outside, the Braun Room was abuzz with a warm, animated energy — a caffeinated energy, perhaps — which could be attributed to the chai and qahwa, traditional Arabic coffee, being passed around.
Indeed, coffee is historically intertwined with the culture of Arabic poetry. The ambience of the maqha, or coffeehouse, was very much evoked in the rich poetry and painting of the night.
The event was organized and run by Serena Rasoul, a resident fellow at the Divinity School this semester. Through her company MA Casting (formerly Muslim Casting), Rasoul strives to elevate the work of artists from MENA/SWANA and Muslim backgrounds. In an interview with The Harvard Crimson, Rasoul discussed the motivation behind organizing this event.
“Taking a Mysticism class with Dr. Ali Asani and meeting so many talented peers inspired me to connect my networks by bringing my friend and world-renowned artist Aadil Abedi to perform a live calligraphy session to a chorus of poetry reciters from HDS in Arabic, Urdu, Farsi and English,” Rasoul said.
The mysticism class that Rasoul was referring to is “Introduction to Islamic Mystical Traditions,” a course cross-registered with the College and the Divinity School. Indeed, most of the poetry reciters of the night were also enrolled in the class. This semester, Shaharyar Zia MTS ’19 is teaching alongside Professor Asani, who himself took the class back in 2017, when he was studying for his graduate degree at the Divinity School. Five years later, as a PhD student in the Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations Department focusing on Islamic intellectual history, Zia is now experiencing the class from the position of a teaching fellow.
“We [in the class] try to situate ideas in their cultural, social and intellectual contexts,” Zia said. “Lately, we have been discussing how, in the Western academy, we are often conditioned to think of many fields [and] sciences as completely distinct.”
But that is not always an accurate assumption for non-Western domains of thought; in Sufi framework, for example, religion, philosophy, poetry, cosmology, and medicine all exist in interwoven spheres.
“That is why somebody writing on Sufi healing could quote you Mawlānā Rūmī in their manuals, while at the same time talking about the Galenic system of medicine,” Zia said. “And you shouldn't be surprised to find poetry even in a text on fiqh (jurisprudence) or on ilāhiyāt (metaphysics). In fact, some people, especially some Sufis, used only poetry to express their philosophical and metaphysical ideas in the Islamic tradition.”
Zia also performed during the event, first presenting some of the Rubāʿiyāt (quatrains) by famous Persian poet Omar Khayyam, whose poetry utilizes symbols of nature to ponder on “the transitory nature of this life.”
As Zia said, Khayyam’s poetry reflects how we come from mud and are supposed to return to it. Interestingly, Zia’s second recitation (a selection from the work of Rumi) was performed in a slightly different tongue, to foster the atmosphere of linguistic diversity.
“This second piece I recited in the Indo-Persian dialect, known as Sabk-e Hindī, to give the audience a feel of the diversity within the Persian language as well,” Zia said.
This understanding of poetry as omnipotent, as transcending disciplinary boundaries put forth by Western framework, seemed to permeate through the air at the event. Abedi, too, expressed his belief that the beauty of Arabic poetry and its script surpasses constructed shackles of religion, nationality, and ideology. With ancestors from Iran, family from India, and personal life rooted in London, Abedi’s amalgam of identities imbues in his work an earnest artistic voice.
“I feel it’s extremely important, especially in the world we live in now, to be a flag-bearer for the beauty of our faith,” Abedi said.
Rasoul spoke to a similar point, iterating that Islamic art suffers from harmful stereotypes in the contemporary world.
“Despite what media representations may have you think, [our] communities are rich with centuries of artistic tradition in the forms of poetry, calligraphy, architecture, and music... reflecting a sense of self-identity, communal history, and spiritual connection,” Rasoul said.
Abedi has painted for a vast array of figures, ranging from Pakistani-British comedian Riz Ahmed, to Bollywood actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. Just this past year, he worked with Disney to create a mesmerizing “Aladdin”-influenced piece for Eid al-Adha.
“Arabic to me is such a beautiful language and script, and if, through this medium, I can change hearts and minds and engage people into positive conversations around my artwork and the broader approach to faith, culture and traditions… then my responsibility as a creative would be met,” Abedi said. “To me, there’s so much grace and compassion within our texts, and being able to turn them into pieces of art which adorn people's private spaces, is so humbling."
Indeed, Abedi’s humility was just as transfixing as his artistic skill. Though clouds hung heavy and rain filled the air, the HDS community found warmth in the immersive beauty of painting and poetry.
“Despite it being one of the rainiest nights of the semester,” Rasoul said, “We were able to fill the room to capacity with over 75 people, all eager to connect, all eager to feel the beautifully poetic experience of soft love woven into our century's old artistic traditions — one we don’t get to celebrate often.”
Zia iterated a similar feeling. “If any place could conduct such an event with such charm, it had to be HDS.”

The author of 11 books, renowned short story writer George Saunders never runs out of insightful observations and nuanced social commentary. In his latest book, “Liberation Day,” Saunders set out to occupy the median between the arbitrary delineation of right and wrong, drawing out fully formed characters that speak from that murky area. He succeeds in his mission to humanize all his characters, despite their questionable actions and ways of thinking, with lucid prose.
Nine short stories make up “Liberation Day.” They wrestle with themes of political strife, economic inequality, domestic unrest, and the meaning of life. Through these stories, Saunders suggests that the past chases everyone; no one can outrun themselves or their history. In the collection’s final story, “My House,” the speaker wallows in regrets and unfulfilled desires. At death’s door, the speaker addresses his adversary in an imaginary letter: “I am all but gone. My idea of your wrongness will go with me.”
George Saunders’s greatest strength is finding humanity in every character. He draws no distinction between good and bad; rather, he operates in the space between this opposition. His characters treat each other badly, care for one another, and make sacrifices. Their decisions reverberate through their communities.
In trying to be a good mother and a good writer, the deeply unsatisfied protagonist of “The Mom of Bold Action” becomes obsessed with her own guilt after causing the injury of another character. She struggles to let go of this event, which occupies her mind through the rest of the story. Saunders captures her narcissistic guilt well. In a creative attempt to ease her conscience, she imagines the injured character offering forgiveness: “And there it was: forgiveness. That’s what forgiveness was. He was her. Being her, he got it all, saw just how the whole thing had happened.”
“Love Letter,” the third story in the book, is perhaps the most haunting of the collection due to its dystopian nature, restrained expression of love, and proximity to reality. The epistolary piece is written from the perspective of a grandfather to his grandson in a dystopian future. Saunders voices the grandfather’s regret about his inaction and complicity in the degraded state of the world: “Our lives had not prepared us for extremity, to mobilize or be as focused and energized as I can see, in retrospect we would have needed to be. We were not prepared to drop everything in defense of a system that was, to us, like oxygen: used constantly, never noted.”
Saunders captures the spiral of regret, made all the more intense by love and the realization that an unknowable future will continue on past one’s life. He speaks to the current political moment through the voice of the grandfather doing what he can to endorse a better future.
The characters’ comedic tendencies bring out the absurdity of their dystopian worlds. Saunders uses this humor to comment on power structures or belief systems without sounding superior. In “The Mom of Bold Action,” for instance, Saunders personifies a can opener through the voice of the protagonist trying to achieve her dreams of writing: “Why was she holding a can opener? Hmm. That could be something. ‘The Trusty Little Opener’ Gerard the Can Opener was a dreamer. He wanted to open BIG things. BIGGER things. The BIGGEST things.”
Saunders creates a lucid tone in his most absurd pieces by reducing his language to its simplest parts. He transcends conventional grammar, pushing the bounds of linguistic meaning through the alteration of structure. This process is especially apparent in “Elliot Spencer,” which follows an old man re-remembering his life after having his memory wiped:
“For as long as world is shiny new there is no death and what lovely may I not yet do?”
Ultimately, Saunders crafts an emotional and enlightening journey through the nine short stories in “Liberation Day” with a restrained and imaginative writing style, peppered with humor and wit. “Liberation Day” is a must-read that engages with many urgent questions of the present in a fundamentally human way.

The following review contains spoilers about the plot of “The Menu.”
“The Menu,” in theaters since Nov. 17, is a sophisticated, uniquely modern film starring Anya Taylor-Joy, Ralph Fiennes, and Judith Light, alongside other impressive actors. Incorporating harsh architectural lines and a strong but neutral color contrast on an otherwise natural setting, the film, set on a secluded island, provides a commentary on the glorification of food culture and its terrifying potential transformation from a once-noble standing to a new form of mass consumption.
The tyrannical villain of the story, Julian Slowik (Fiennes), is a highly decorated and rewarded chef, obsessed with precision, attention to detail, and control. In his restaurant, Slowik painstakingly creates a seemingly perfect, ever-changing menu that reflects the island, the seasons, and the customers. On the evening that the film takes place, each customer has been carefully chosen to partake in Slowik’s final dinner — a last gift, per se, to the world of haute cuisine.
When protagonist Margot (Taylor-Joy) appears as a surprise guest for the evening, her presence throws many, especially Slowik, off guard. Beyond advancing the plot, Margot, unimpressed by the elaborate food offered by Slowik, inserts a reality check in the quite overblown expression of food culture portrayed in the film. As one can be blinded by a glorious painting, or an exquisite symphony, one, too, can be blinded by what is believed to be the ultimate concoction of cuisine. At this treacherous point, do the diners see the chef’s art for what it is, or do they only see what they think the art should be?
One particularly incredible element of the film is its set, which emphasizes Slowik’s own precision. From the crustacean-covered shore to the quaint smokehouse, the attention to detail and interaction between modernity and nature are clearly at their peak.
One set that is quite interesting, for instance, is the chef’s cottage, which was an almost exact replica of the dining room itself. This creates the uncanny, almost “The Shining”-like atmosphere of psychological-thriller films, posing even more questions as to the mysterious background of the chef.
The film, as a whole, is unusual in the sense that it plays along the thin line between fiction and reality. The premise of a chef attracting people to an island and feeding them a many-course, inevitably intricate meal is very believable in our own modern food culture. Yet this film shows obsession going one step too far: a warning, perhaps, that as the evolution of food culture progresses towards more novelty and precision, consumers may forget that food should actually be warm, comforting, and something that will simply make one happy, as highlighted by Margot in the film.
Fiennes, historically a master at portraying evil, played Slowik very well, balancing the power and precision of a chef with the subtle insanity behind his eyes. Taylor-Joy’s character, the exact opposite of Slowik, provided a counterbalance to his tension, leaving much to say behind her eyes as well.
Tension is maintained very effectively throughout the film. With the frightening, powerful clap of Slowik’s hands, the attention of the cooks in the kitchen, and the delicate poetry he uses to describe each dish, one is captivated with both terror and amazement by the atmosphere Slowik creates.
By about halfway through their meal, the diners begin to understand what Slowik’s plans are, but they accept their fate a little too quickly for the film to be considered a realistic portrayal of human fear. While watching, viewers may forget that this entire movie occurs over the course of only a few hours. Therefore, the evolution and progression of characters within the plot seems a little forced, and not entirely realistic.
Other than the clearly antagonistic dynamic between Fiennes and Taylor-Joy — who, in a strange way, can come across as either friends or foes — the backstories and views of the other characters are less straightforward. Each, while appearing normal on the outside, are in one way or another flawed beings, all burdened by mistakes of a varying scale.
This powerful film highlights the incompatibility between supposed perfection and underlying imperfection of fine dining. The film examines how, while imperfect people may be drawn to the idea of perfection, perfection does not exist, though its seekers do not tolerate anything less. “The Menu” serves as a reminder that, in the long run, seeing the beauty in imperfection is a necessity that should not be overlooked — something Slowik has abysmally, and fatally, forgotten.

This review contains spoilers for the Season Three Premiere of ‘Dead to Me.’
It’s been quite some time since viewers last heard from Jen and Judy, the beloved duo at the heart of Netflix’s buzzy dramedy “Dead to Me.” However, fans will likely remember that Season Two ended with the cliffhanger of Jen and Judy’s major car accident. And despite almost three years separating Seasons Two and Three, the series’ new (and final) installment picks up where it left off in the aftermath of this brutal crash. What follows is a surprisingly mundane premiere, lacking much of the flashy shock value that cemented “Dead to Me” as a bingeable treat.
After opening with a rather bizarre and somewhat misplaced dream sequence, the show quickly establishes that both Jen and Judy survived Season Two’s hit-and-run with miraculously minor injuries. And while this choice greatly cheapens the narrative impact of the crash in retrospect, it is all worth it to get another season of chemistry between Christina Applegate and Linda Cardellini. Truly, this duo and their impeccable comedic timing comprise the core of this show, and without the tangible camaraderie they share it could not survive.
In the premiere, Applegate’s unbreakable shield of sarcasm and cynicism provides ample opportunity for strong observational humor, with the episode feeling slightly “Seinfeld”-esque as Jen rails against the perceived shortcomings of her hospital care. However, Applegate is careful not to let this schtick become all-consuming, as she softens the edges of Jen’s character by allowing some poignant moments of fear and regret to sneak through her steely facade.
As the endlessly cheery foil to a jaded Jen, Cardellini’s Judy quickly reminds viewers of just how delightful her character can be. Never taking a moment to mind her own health after the crash, Judy showers Jen with love and care, two emotions that Cardellini has mastered by this point in the show’s run. In fact, it is rather fascinating how Cardellini transforms what could have been a one-note optimistic character into the compelling and deeply complex Judy, whom audiences cannot help but adore. One scene involving an elaborate pain-killer heist reminds viewers of Judy’s ability to rationalize morally dubious acts through her care for others — a deft moment of characterization by the creators.
However, despite the unsurprisingly strong performances from two actors who have inhabited their roles for quite some time, the rest of the premiere falls flat. With most of the action happening within the confines of a hospital, the episode feels like a poorly paced and dialogue-heavy prelude to what promises to be a more eventful season in the subsequent episodes. However, after audiences have waited years for the return of a show that thrives on gasp-inducing plot twists, this reintroduction feels rather tepid.
The necessity of an entire episode dedicated to setting up so many plotlines also reveals one of the show’s key weaknesses: There is simply too much going on. Without watching a comprehensive review of prior seasons, viewers will never be able to remember all the issues that need resolving in this final season. And while “Dead to Me” does at times lean into its soapy nature in blue-tinted flashbacks and other over-the-top moments, its overstuffed plot can feel slightly messy, taking away from the fun of the show. And with the reveal of Judy’s cancer diagnosis towards the end of the premiere, it’s clear that the show is not going to slow down any time soon.
Despite the shortcomings of its premiere, “Dead to Me” continues to deliver a funny and compelling story with a spectacular representation of friendship as its beating heart. And considering this will be the show’s final opportunity to give viewers a dose of its trademark shock and awe, there should be little fear that “Dead to Me” will flatline in Season Three.

All is not well with Jennifer Lawrence.
This is the general sentiment that prevails in the early scenes of Lila Neugebauer’s new Apple TV+ film “Causeway.” Amidst a sparse score and an unadorned bedroom setting, Lawrence’s character Lynsey does lots of staring and struggles to perform basic tasks without the help of an older caretaker. It eventually becomes clear that Lynsey is suffering from PTSD as a result of a vaguely described accident during military service in Afghanistan. While this is certainly a jarring start, what follows is an endearing vignette of human resilience and companionship. But while “Causeway”’s strong lead performances do much to make this story compelling, its heavy-handed dose of melodrama acts as a conspicuous obstacle to its emotional resonance.
In one of her most ambitious and dramatic roles to date, Jennifer Lawrence is predictably outstanding. The film’s beginning is a particularly rich site for her to flaunt her acting expertise; her limp and lifeless disposition is so visceral that it becomes almost uncomfortable to watch. While Lynsey eventually regains much of her bodily functionality, Lawrence still lets glimpses of her trauma slip through in the way she carries herself, a nuanced and highly skillful touch. Beyond her physicality, Lawrence also lends some of her trademark sarcastic wit to Lynsey in a way that not only allows audiences to relish in this recognizable persona but also feels like a necessary addition to the character’s personality. By showing the emotional ebbs and flows of Lynsey’s recovery, Lawrence paints a realistic and compelling portrait of her character.
While matching the dynamism of one of Hollywood’s most adept actors is no small feat, Brian Tyree Henry, who plays Lawrence’s newfound friend James, manages to do just that. Indeed, Henry displays his own well-established acting prowess by making audiences laugh and cry in the same scene through James’s lively humor and extreme vulnerability. After meeting Lynsey at his auto shop, James is quick to befriend her and supports her with a warmth that radiates from the screen. This emotional potency appears most vividly when James recounts his own trauma to Lynsey, with Henry letting the memory roll off his tongue with a resigned cadence and blank stare that is equal parts transfixing and tragic. Henry acts as a grounded foil to Lawrence’s unraveled Lynsey and develops his own character in a meaningful way, thus rounding out the talent in “Causeway”’s leading duo.
Unfortunately, the film’s emotionally charged performances fail to mask the misplaced melodrama that acts as “Causeway”’s Achilles’ heel. While the film succeeds at conveying Lynsey’s despair in the quiet moments of reflection she shares with James, it often undermines its own deft characterization with an overreliance on long shots of Lawrence staring at nothing in particular. This motif of the lingering camera feels slightly overindulgent by the film’s end, almost as if the director is begging the audience to recognize the obvious fact that Lynsey is sad.
The film’s melodrama reaches its peak during an emotional fight scene between Lynsey and James — at once the film’s flashiest and weakest. When audiences are just starting to become invested in the two characters’ budding friendship, suddenly this combative scene rushes together and feels far too much like an unnatural plot mechanism. The insults that each character throws at the other seem hyperbolic and confusing, merely opening the door to a formulaic reunion at the film’s end. While the film as a whole certainly tells an original and compelling story, this scene veers deep into the realm of generic Oscar bait by using a moment of loud screaming to ensure audiences take note of the actors’ commitment to their roles.
The film’s world-building efforts are not particularly noteworthy, with its depiction of New Orleans mostly limited to James’ shop and a smattering of houses. The few instances when the camera pans over the ostentatious mansions whose pools Lynsey cleans for part-time employment constitute some of the film’s strongest cinematographic moments, as they allude to the socioeconomic dimensions of this story. By placing Lynsey in a world so unlike that of her own run-down home, the film skilfully uses setting to amplify her disillusionment and make her desire for something different understandable.
As its title suggests, “Causeway” tells the story of a transitory period in one person’s life, a particularly turbulent crossing rife with reflection and reconnection. In its efforts to recount Lynsey’s return to normalcy, the film artfully captures the flurry of mixed emotions that may entail such an experience while occasionally administering too great a dose of dramatic embellishment. But even when all else fails (which is rare), there is always Jennifer Lawrence to save the day.

In the velvet darkness of the Boston Common AMC, there’s a guiding star no matter what or who you are. Since 1984, Boston’s Full Body Cast troupe has been bringing the cult classic horror rock musical “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” to life in the local movie theater via their shadow performances. Every Saturday at 9:30 p.m., audiences can come up to the frightful, campy lab of a Dr. Frankenstein-esque scientist clad in fishnet stockings and black stilettos. But as they’re watching the “innocent” protagonist couple, Brad and Janet, enter this sex-saturated, Transylvanic, gothic castle on screen, they’ll also see the same scenes acted out in front of the film.
Following the “Rocky Horror” cult tradition, the Full Body Cast stages a weekly re-enactment of the film as the original plays on screen, complete with lighting, simultaneous acting, screamed interjections, simulated sex, toilet paper, party hats, and more. However, as wild as this experience may seem, there’s a method and a message to Full Body Cast’s madness.
Although a movie-going audience will only see the dynamic, sexually charged performances of a cast miming through classic songs like “Hot Patootie” and “Touch-A, Touch-A, Touch-A, Touch Me,” the behind-the-scenes work to put on the show weekly goes beyond the Saturday performances. As Full Body Cast Producer Molly Scrivens says, “There’s a lot of different moving pieces to the show... making sure we have the right equipment. We have rehearsals once a month, even though we do it every week. We have auditions... There’s a lot that people don’t see.” Though the logistical work and preparation are extensive, Scrivens and fellow producer Jen Lipschitz highlight the group’s strong bonds behind the scenes.
Lipschitz talks about the ironclad community among both participating members and alumni of the show, saying that “we’re family... I know that if I ever get stuck on the side of the road, I can just send out a message, and someone I haven’t seen or spoken to in ten years will come rescue me. That’s a really powerful feeling.”
Part of that camaraderie comes from the comfort established among the cast before curtain, as Scrivens notes: “We do a lot of bonding with our castmates... being able to feel like there’s at least some sort of connection between all of [them] before [they] get up on stage and are dancing around in lingerie.”
Because “Rocky Horror” requires sexual simulation and near-nudity, comfort among cast members is a must; but, for the same reasons, “Rocky Horror” also calls for an extraordinary comfort in one’s own body. With Rocky only donning gold underwear and most of the cast spending the entire third act in sparkling corsets and garters, freedom from self-consciousness seems like a prerequisite to act in this show. However, as much as performers need that liberation to play their parts, “Rocky Horror” itself often serves as the catalyst for finding that freedom.
For many queer adolescents over the decades, “Rocky Horror” and its shadow-casted shows have become the north star — a beacon where anyone can flock when they’re in want of a welcoming space. From Dr. Frank N. Furter’s shameless, genderless expressionism to Brad and Janet’s budding sexual fluidity, everyone can find a mirror for themselves embedded in “Rocky”: it stands for inclusion at its highest degree.
Cast member Will spoke on how embodying the show’s roles allows for a full array of gender expression: “I am trans-masculine, and I recently played Brad for the first time, and that was some big time gender euphoria. ‘Rocky’ for a lot of people is a chance to express yourself gender-wise in ways that you might not get to in the real world.”
While acting in “Rocky Horror” offers its own form of community and liberation, you only have to be in the audience to experience “The Picture Show’s” magic. Cal, a “Rocky” fan and viewer, said before a recent screening that “‘Rocky Horror’ was just a great community and a great place to get together with people who are like me or allies to me. It’s very much a queer space or at least a space that’s very welcoming to queer people.”
The Full Body Cast’s production of “Rocky Horror” is an essential part of maintaining this sentiment in Boston and remains an experience that every Bostonian should have. The weekly 9:30 p.m. show at the AMC Boston Common 19 is now the light “over at the Frankenstein place” that leads fans to a community of fright, delight, and total acceptance.

Whether for the film’s portrayal of the horrors of racism or its commentary on the importance of fighting for justice, everyone should see “Till.” The film follows Mamie Till-Mobley (Danielle Deadwyler), the real-life mother of Emmett Till, as she grapples with her grief and fights for changes to segregation and racial equality in America. Emmett was only fourteen years old when he was lynched in 1955 during a trip he took alone to Mississippi. After discovering the truth about what happened to her son, Till-Mobley courageously spoke out about racial injustice, becoming an activist.
Above all, “Till” succeeds in telling an emotional and even hard-to-watch story in order to convey an effective message about the severity of segregation during this time. The film begins by depicting the days before Emmett Till traveled to Mississippi, and it features a compelling sequence showing his youthful and happy nature. From the start of the film, audiences already know the ending of this story. However, by effectively conveying aspects of Emmett’s personality, it gives the audience a bigger picture of the realities of bigotry.
Deadwyler delivers an electrifying performance that compellingly carries each scene of the film. Deadwyler shines most in the heartbreaking scenes in which she realizes what happened to her son. The most striking scene in the film is the uncovering of Emmett’s deceased body in front of his mother at the funeral home. This scene was so striking that it would be no surprise if the audience turned away from the screen to escape the horrors of Emmett’s body after the attack occurred. Gruesome as the scene might be, Till-Mobley wanted the world to see what happened to her son to fully realize the horrors of segregation in the 1950s, so it is fitting for the film to further this goal.
As described in the film, it is easy to listen to Emmett Till’s story and not realize the horror of the realities that took place in 1950s America. This decision to include the body of Emmett Till in several scenes in the film furthered Till-Mobley’s wish to broadcast the extent of what happened to her son to all.
In addition to standing out in scenes of tragedy, Deadwyler gives a remarkable performance that shows what it means to be a mother and to care so deeply for one's child. Throughout the film, Deadwyler shows audiences what it means to be fully immersed in her character and to believe in her role and the message it conveys, using powerful expressions and memorable line deliveries. Jayln Hall similarly shines in his role as young Emmett, displaying Emmett’s playful innocence and kind demeanor. This performance sets up a devastating second half of the film, as his mother must grapple with the loss of her vibrant, loveable boy.
When speaking about her role, Deadwyler noted the significance in understanding more about Till-Mobley than just surface-level knowledge.
"We know this very black-and-white binary understanding of her experience. We know that she made a significant choice that was the catalyst for the civil-rights movement. And we saw the image of his body, we saw the various images of her in deep mourning, but you don't necessarily see all of the triumphant awareness and the brilliance — and, specifically, the power that she began to stand in,” she told Entertainment Weekly.
There is no doubt that “Till” could be considered the most heart-breaking historical retelling of the year. The film depicts several scenes that are difficult to watch; however, in doing so, it tackles many important themes relating to segregation and Till’s murder. It is important to understand that these events took place not that long ago, and it is vital for this story to continue to be told.

Writer Annie Ernaux was awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Literature “for the courage and clinical acuity with which she uncovers the roots, estrangements and collective restraints of personal memory.” Nowhere does that ring more true than in “Se perdre,” Ernaux’s 2001 French-language novel translated into English this year by Alison L. Strayer.
“Getting Lost” is a collection of Ernaux’s journal entries from September 1988 to April 1990, artifacts of her intense and one-sided love affair with a married Soviet diplomat. The diplomat, referred to as S, loudly dons Saint Laurent and Guy Laroche yet relies on Ernaux for packs of Marlboros; he is younger and actively avoids reciprocating her romantic affections.
The man himself is nothing special. He leans unflinchingly into the stereotypes of Cold War-era envoy and disavowed lover. Alongside Ernaux, especially — a woman who was already decades into an established literary career at the start of their entanglement — he appears even more unremarkable. S’s attitude lays the groundwork for Ernaux’s book, as she incisively recounts the metaphorical chokehold that an ordinary, inattentive lover can have on their partner.
A major feeling that pervades the novel is that of being reduced. Reduced to docility and servitude; to the role of a supportive, slender mistress in his presence and, in his absence, of a wide-eyed girl wasting the day away waiting for a phone call that may never come.
S was not the first man to provoke such behavior in Ernaux. She recalls similarly enchanting men from her earlier years with wistful nostalgia, as well as her ex-husband — though with much less affection. These flashbacks come with a sense of dreadful anxiety: Ernaux questions why she is like this, and if she will ever stop. What is it about her, or about these men, that forces her into a supporting role in the story of her own life, even if only for a while?
It’s a fascinating question to observe a human being grappling with, made even more fascinating by the journal entry format. These entries — meticulous reflections of the day’s events or attempts to gather Ernaux’s lovelorn thoughts — were not intended to be read by anyone else. Aside from necessary revisions like obscuring identities, these entries remain timeless testaments to Ernaux’s reality at a given moment.
In this way, “Getting Lost” is the closest one can get to observing an author’s thoughts as they develop in real time. Ernaux’s self-awareness and shrewd writing make her the ideal subject for such an exercise: The reader can be assured that the feelings she conveys are wholly authentic, and their nuances are unforgotten, represented as best as possible by the words on the page.
The book is suitable for anyone intrigued by such an exercise, but will be more biting for those who can relate to Ernaux’s position of unrequited lover. A major triumph of the novel is that it shows the reader what it looks like to make space for the shameful and worrisome parts of oneself; those who have been in her position may see some of these parts of themselves reflected in the text.
“Getting Lost” might also strike a particular chord with women. She calls back often to her identity as a woman, questioning the extent to which it’s shaped her personality and caused her to become an obsessive romantic partner.
Whether or not this English-language translation captured the precise essence of Ernaux’s every sentiment is yet to be seen. But Strayer, Ernaux’s latest translator, works very hard to disentangle emotionally and linguistically complex constructions at every turn, in addition to providing footnotes that helpfully contextualize Ernaux’s shorthand as well as the historical background of the time.
At the end of the day, Ernaux’s soul-bearing source text and Strayer’s expertise combine to produce a resounding, gripping work of art that proves to be more than worth its weight in salt. What could have been nothing more than a personal diary detailing a secretive and ultimately inconsequential mid-life love affair has, by virtue of excellent storytelling, become a representation of what it means to be human, in all of its embarrassing and reductive glory.

The Boston Ballet’s performance of “As Anticipated” was anything but. During the company’s first show since before the pandemic fully designed by choreographer William Forsythe, the dancers challenged the limits of expression. Boston Ballet dancers performed three Forsythe works in the show’s Nov. 3 to Nov. 13 run: “Approximate Sonata,” first performed in 1996; “Artifact Suite” (2004); and the world premiere of “Défilé.”
Forsythe’s work blends the choreographic careers of his classical predecessors with an exploration of modernity, breaking from traditional ballet boundaries in a style unprecedented enough to make Rudolf Nureyev stir in his grave. The choreographer’s innovative exploration of movement paired with the Boston Ballet’s stunning artistry made for a profound inquiry of themes of individuality and conformity, arresting the audience as they processed the unanticipated.
The curtain of the Citizens Bank Opera House opened first on Forsythe’s “Approximate Sonata.” And then closed. And opened again. Unpredictably rising and descending to ominously pulsating tones throughout the night’s opening act, even the curtain was integrated into the tension of the performance’s story-telling. The set itself continued to act as an added dancer throughout the night, as seen in the ever-shifting lighting designs throwing dancers’ shadows across the stage in “Artifact Suite.” The curtain’s closing speed after each subsection of “Défilé” also subtly increased, until it slammed onto the stage with such force as to become a percussive supplement to the music.
The brilliantly choreographed series of pas-de-deuxs in the first act at once leaned into and deflected the uneasy edge generated by the set and accompanying sounds. Partners brought to life a series of cause-and-effect movements, which featured a highly refined sensitivity to the other dancer. Principal dancers Lia Cirio and John Lam (who also teaches at the Harvard Dance Center) opened the show with sensational athleticism and grace as they honored Forsythe’s balance of classic pas-de-deux elegance and the contemporary take on partner-work. Simultaneously defying and reveling in the physics of movement, the pair precisely articulated movements which variously paralleled, complemented, and contradicted each other. Throughout “Approximate Sonata,” dancers alternately echoed and countered each other’s extensions, lines, and movement qualities. They intertwined and separated in penchés and partner pirouettes, forging an unexpected synthesis of the staccato, legato, the free, and controlled.
Forsythe’s innovation in solo and partner choreography shone brightly against the backdrop of the ensemble, which was far from relegated to the background. Instead, the hypnotically synchronized movements enveloped and blended seamlessly with the work of the soloists. The solo choreography intersected and dissolved into that of the ensemble, the dancers escaping and rejoining the corps to proffer questions of individuality in the face of conformity.
The ballet’s mesmerizing choreography continued to stun in “Artifact Suite” with further captivating experimentation in the corps de ballet. The ensemble moved as one à la the Royal Ballet’s Swan Lake Act II, yet their movements broke free from traditional ballet as they clapped rhythms and played with both robotic and free-flowing motions. Rising abruptly from their undetected positions on the floor upstage in the second section, the ensemble’s repeated defiance of the predictable elicited audible surprise from observers.
“As Anticipated” left the audience in breathless suspense, strung between each delightfully unexpected moment. William Forsythe’s choreography in conversation with the Boston Ballet’s renowned skill and artistry imbued new life into the expressive capacity of ballet. Confronting the viewer with contemplations of the human experience, the performance saut-de-chat-ed over the balletic boundaries observed by Forsythe’s predecessors and into the ballet of the modern era — one freed from the confines of the anticipated.

Given Mexican author Yuri Herrera’s academic background in political science, readers often expect his work to function as an allegory for social issues. Herrera resists these interpretations. In an interview with Latin American Literature Today, he said plainly, “I don’t write thesis novels.” Instead of structuring a novel around pointed criticism or proposed ideologies, Herrera crafts emotional journeys that explore the human experiences of political crises. For example, his widely-acclaimed “Signs Preceding the End of the World” follows a young woman who embarks on an odyssey that resembles a migrant’s journey across the Southern U.S. border. He refuses to name either country in the novel or provide any historical context, focusing instead on the protagonist’s identity conflict.
Herrera’s fifth book “Ten Planets” poses a challenge to his commitment not to write a “thesis novel.” Translated from the Spanish by long-time collaborator Lisa Dillman, this collection of short stories is Herrera’s first foray into science-fiction. Sci-fi books often function as critiques of current institutions or as proposals for better ones. Given the conventions of the genre, it’s difficult not to be didactic. Herrera, however, sticks to his ethos as he invents worlds that allow him to investigate how individuals and societies alike create meaning for themselves. “Ten Planets” is neither warning nor prophecy — it is a compelling contemplation on the human capacity to find beauty in even the most dystopian settings, as well as its tendency to create instruments of oppression.
Within each of the novel’s 13 short stories, Herrera creates thought-provoking characters and settings. In “Whole Entero,” a gut bacterium spontaneously gains consciousness. Imbued with subtle absurdity and humor, the story tracks the organism as it contemplates existence. Herrera’s concise, lyrical prose is the driving force of the story. In one moment of enlightenment, the bacterium eloquently realizes, “No, the grandiose and definitive could never be defined by the brief and simple and elementary.” Not bad for a single-celled organism.
Other stories read more like conventional science-fiction pieces that culminate in a realization about a dystopia. “The Objects” imagines a future in which factory workers can only enter the world outside after transforming into animals. Climbing the corporate ladder means ascending the food chain — floor workers turn into insects while managers become lions. The story builds anticipation about the company executives’ animal of choice, and the surprising ending raises questions about the malleability of individual worth.
The brevity of each piece allows Herrera to dwell on these philosophical scenarios without becoming long-winded or dogmatic. Additionally, Herrera intersperses lighter stories full of wonder among more meditative ones to keep the tone from becoming too grave. After all, celebrating existence is just as important as thinking about it. In “The Earthling,” a lonely astronomer stranded on a foreign planet rediscovers joy after finding a canine companion. Readers don’t have to be dog lovers to laugh and cry at the story’s moving conclusion.
One drawback to the brevity of Herrera’s stories is that it sometimes feels like he is leaving so many of his imaginary worlds unexplored. The settings of each story are so unique that it’s a shame that they are left undeveloped. In each piece, Herrera only examines one dynamic within what could be a universe of possibilities. “The Conspirators” entertains a fascinating concept: Two colonies of humans from different eras on Earth arrive at the same time on another planet. Herrera’s story establishes some of the inequalities resulting from such an encounter, but readers don’t get to see how these dynamics play out.
That’s not to say that the stories in “Ten Planets” have unsatisfying endings. Herrera crafts plots that build and release suspense to powerful effect. “The Obituarist” reads like a masterfully-written thriller as the title character attempts to solve a case of stolen identity. In line with the rest of the novel, the story concludes with not only a culprit reveal but also a reflection on the human desire for validation.
The upcoming English release of “Ten Planets” is a feat of translation as much as it is a literary achievement. Lisa Dillman has translated all of Herrera’s previous four novels, and it’s clear that she possesses a deep understanding of how Herrera manipulates and stretches language. In her translator’s note, Dillman offers an illuminating example: “Yuri has spoken in the past about selecting particular words he consciously wants to use (or avoid) in a given work. I did not ask him whether he’d done this in [“Ten Planets”], but it struck me that one of the words he’d decided to use was ápice, often translated as shred, speck, ounce, inch, bit, or iota.”
Dillman explains that she chose to translate every instance of “ápice” as “iota” because it allowed for more idiosyncratic interpretations, in line with Herrera’s use of Spanish words in unconventional contexts. On a symbolic level, she also believes that the word suits the novel because of its scientific definition as the ninth star in a constellation. Any text loses some of its meaning when translated, but Dillman’s deliberate, artful work preserves much of Herrera’s magic.
A prevailing theme in “Ten Planets” is that existence is the sum of infinite individual moments. Herrera eloquently puts it in “Obverse”: “They traversed iotas and iotas. Deserts of iotas and dales of iotas and mountains of iotas. Millions of iotas.” The novel’s 13 stories are themselves iotas, slivers of human experience.
And just as Herrera and Dillman warp the rules of their respective languages to create new meaning, these stories bend the rules of the natural world and civilization to explore individuals at their most profound, most despicable, and most absurd. The result is a compelling collection that poses challenging questions and encourages contemplation. Perhaps the scientific definition of “iota” is more accurate than Dillman gives herself credit for. The novel, by itself, isn’t complete: It only possesses nine out of the 10 titular celestial bodies. Readers complete the constellation, bringing their questions and experiences to engage with Herrera’s masterful, thought-provoking stories.

Netflix’s new docuseries “Pepsi, Where's My Jet?” truly epitomizes the saying “if there’s a will, there’s a way.” It centers around a boy who, in 1996, takes a Pepsi ad too seriously, then ends up suing the corporation to get a military fighter jet.
The documentary reminds viewers of Pepsi’s popularity in the ‘90s and explains the concept of Pepsi points, a loyalty program that allowed customers to purchase premiums with points. Although this flashy introduction initially distracts from the series’ informative nature, it successfully establishes Pepsi’s cultural significance in the United States and the traction it was drawing from the public at the time.
Then, the source of all the drama is introduced: the infamous ad. The advertisement, which aired on television during the 1990s showcased Pepsi as a cool drink, showing a boy stepping out of a military fighter jet. The ad jokingly claimed that the jet was worth 7,000,000 Pepsi points, however, it provided no official disclaimer. Most people might think this is only a marketing ploy and not a serious offer. Most people, that is, except for John Leonard.
The story is introduced with a bit of the blame game for who’s fault this Pepsi ad was, as various people involved provide different accounts of the advertisement, exposing tensions between Pepsi’s creative team and management. The situation quickly escalates as 20-year-old Leonard finds a loophole in Pepsi points to win the jet, and eventually enters into a legal battle with the company, because it would be essentially illegal for Pepsi to give away a military weapon.
The series tells a true story, but its pacing ultimately feels unrealistic as Leonard’s onscreen fight against Pepsi unfolds without exploring many of the real-life complexities of the case. Everything seems to go too smoothly, telling an “intense” story where Leonard finds loophole after loophole. Nevertheless, the series is engaging every second of the way, and this may be because of its simplicity. The balance of intensity, intrigue, and uninterrupted flow is what makes this plotline great.
As the war between Pepsi and Leonard continues, the story’s focus moves from the court case itself to the people involved in it. The series introduces Leonard’s support system, and their motives behind aiding the ambitious kid who wants a military fighter jet just to prove a point. This emphasis on personal relationships is a clever choice by producers, keeping audiences engaged beyond legal jargon.
It quickly becomes clear that this piece of media is a cautionary tale about advertising and how far someone will go to prove themselves. Although this shift from the Pepsi case to the motives and background stories of those involved seemed out of place for the title of this docuseries, it is an intriguing angle to take.
This show highlights family stories and intrinsic motivations, as numerous people tell their stories and opinions surrounding the Pepsi chaos. In the context of Leonard’s team, the docuseries is full of strong personalities determined to get things done and do the impossible. To viewers, these individuals might seem either narcissistic or inspirational, so it is definitely a large risk to take when it comes to gaining audience support for both the general piece and the people involved in Leonard’s team.
Overall, anyone looking for an outrageous, fast-paced, packed story should watch “Pepsi, Where’s My Jet?” immediately. It shows Pepsi and advertising in a unique light, while providing some interesting personalities on screen — a true lesson to companies to be careful with what they promise customers, even if they want to sell more of their product.
People will either love the strong-headed team by Leonard’s side, or love to hate them. Either way, they are definitely a group of go-getters who know how to tell a surprising, engaging story.

Creepy, kooky, mysterious, and spooky, Tim Burton’s eight-episode Netflix series “Wednesday” revels in the beloved weirdness of the Addams family’s only daughter. Released on Wednesday, Nov. 23, each wild and unpredictable moment is steeped in Burton’s signature style. Yet, the series’ true success lies with the jaunty, offbeat coming-of-age story that rises from the chaos.
Jenna Ortega’s Wednesday is a cello-playing, novel-writing, sword-fighting, monster-hunting heroine who lives up to the fan-favorite character’s 84-year legacy. Joined by Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzmán as Morticia and Gomez Addams, Wednesday’s wacky yet sincere parents, Ortega delivers a convincing performance chock-full of teenage angst and macabre spunk.
The series begins after Wednesday’s latest high school expulsion as she is shipped off to Nevermore Academy, the same magical boarding school her parents attended. Nevermore is home to “outcasts,” a vague term that applies to students with a range of supernatural abilities from werewolves to sirens, vampires to witches, and seemingly everything in between.
A cross between Hogwarts and Harvard, Nevermore boasts a yearly tournament held in honor of alumnus Edgar Allan Poe, a secret underground library, and a courtyard affectionately referred to as “the Quad.” A true self-insert for any Harvard first-year, Wednesday is soon forced to adjust to her outgoing roommate, navigate potential love interests, explore her mother’s former elite social club, and save her school from a zombie pilgrim dead set on revenge. (Just to be safe, let’s avoid reciting curses in front of the John Harvard statue for a while.)
As the season progresses and a series of mysterious disappearances perplex Nevermore’s Principal Weems (Gwendoline Christie), Wednesday discerns that something sinister is afoot. Among her growing list of suspects are classmates, local townspeople, and a Nevermore teacher, played by Christina Ricci. Of course, Addams devotees will instantly recognize Ricci as Wednesday from the 1991 film franchise.
But fear not, the series’ spooky references do not stop at this cameo. Thing, a disembodied hand with a surprising sense of sarcasm, is Watson to Wednesday’s Sherlock Holmes throughout the season. Appearances by Uncle Fester, Lurch the butler, and the infamous Addams’ family “double snap” also pay homage to the canon of previous adaptations.
Admittedly, an October release date would have been more fitting for the show, which feels slightly out of place now that spooky season has passed us by. Perhaps audiences searching for Halloween content would be more forgiving of the show’s slightly awkward attempt to capture Gen Z teen lingo and its overly campy side-plots. But the few misfire lines and somewhat contrived melodrama never manage to outshine the show’s indulgently gothic atmosphere.
After all, the dynamic duo of visionary director Tim Burton and musical genius Danny Elfman is simply unmatched. “Wednesday” joins the legacy of such iconic collaborations as “The Nightmare Before Christmas,” “Edward Scissorhands,” and “Beetlejuice,” and succeeds in capturing a similar synergy of chilling score and deliciously eerie, darkly imaginative visuals.
Undaunted by his previous works, Elfman not only delivers a memorable organ-driven opening theme song, but also composes the playfully gloomy backdrop for the entire season. In one standout musical moment, Wednesday climbs onto the roof of her dormitory, cello in hand, and performs Elfman’s gothic orchestral rendition of The Rolling Stones’s “Paint It, Black.”
Yet another highlight is the series’ costumes, which put an original spin on Wednesday’s monochromatic color palette. Styling platform boots, pinstriped blouses, and even an extravagant black lace dress for episode four’s “Carrie”-esque school formal, Academy Award winning costume designer Colleen Atwood (of “Sweeney Todd” and “Sleepy Hollow” fame) teams up with Burton once again to curate an eclectic collection perfectly suited to Wednesday’s quirky style.
In the end, it is Wednesday’s character development that brings the show to a strangely heart-warming conclusion. Strengthening her relationship with Morticia, and exhibiting fierce loyalty to her newfound friends, Wednesday emerges utterly transformed — without losing any of her penchant for medieval torture, of course.
With hints of a second season lurking throughout the final scenes, Burton’s newest work will certainly thrill established fans. And for those who have yet to pay a call on the strange and deranged Addams Family, “Wednesday” is the perfect series to make their acquaintance.

On Oct. 22, the day after releasing his newest album “Here Goes Nothing,” Adam Melchor performed at Boston’s MGM Music Hall at Fenway as an opener for folk pop artist Noah Kahan. The venue, while grandiose and beaming like a scene out of a movie, was softened with the bright glow of Melchor and his many guitars. It was clear at some points that the crowd, while still filing in from the lines that wrapped the building, were not necessarily Melchor’s typical followers. The singer didn’t appear to mind, however, as he welcomed all to enjoy some of his old and new songs alike. Melchor eventually won the audience over by cracking a few jokes, including one about how he released his album on the same day Taylor Swift released her chart-topping “Midnights” album.
Mixing some of his songs that were released literally the day before the show like “i’m ready” and his older hits like “Joyride,” Melchor created an experience where the audience wasn’t expected to know the words, but were encouraged to just listen, vibe, and dance — something a lot of music artists lose sight of when performing at concerts. Between his sentimental songs and his practiced guitar switches, Melchor told some stories about the background of his music and songwriting process.
One of the most interesting stories included a teasing of Charlie Puth or as he called him his “Sweet Charles,” who “totally ghosted” him. Melchor’s track “Let Me Know When,” featuring Fleet Foxes, has credited Charlie Puth as an assisting writer, but the story of how they got to that point reveals more layers.
Melchor was over at Puth’s house — which he described as bigger than an entire campus — where Puth was looming over his “majestic piano.” They sat together and wrote the start to a song — which Melchor described as a surreal experience, but one he nevertheless was determined to finish. After exchanging information, Melchor finished the song and sent it to Puth, who never replied. In curiosity and a little bit of anxiousness, Melchor approached Puth at an event they were both at together. When he asked about why he didn’t reply to the song Puth said it was because it was “the saddest song he ever wrote.” To which Melchor exclaimed to the audience that he “monetized on the trauma!”
The song was very melancholic with lyrics completing the title: “Let me know when you fall out of love with me.” If that wasn’t heart-wrenching enough, Melchor sang an interlude with a snippet of Keane’s “Somewhere Only We Know” that needs to be released on Spotify immediately.
Throughout his set, Melchor revealed himself to be not only talented but also incredibly humble. Constantly giving thanks to an audience that was barely attentive and highly intoxicated. It is clear that he is happy and content making music, and has little expectations of how fast and big fame should be, and this is something his fans and future listeners will appreciate.
Catching up with him after the concert, The Harvard Crimson asked him how he felt after his performance.
“I feel great about it, it's so nice to be able to play live,” he said. “I wanna go on record and say Noah Kahan is the nicest person I’ve ever met, and that's it,” he said, proving once again to be the humble and incredibly thankful artist that deserves the successful career he is creating and will continue to create.

Even though “Enola Holmes 2” dims in comparison to the first film in the mystery series, it is charming nonetheless. The “Enola Holmes” movies depict the adventures of Sherlock Holmes’s teenage sister, Enola, in a manner unlike many other mystery films. With a teenage heroine at its helm, “Enola Holmes” makes the mystery genre more accessible to younger audiences through wit and expressions emblematic of young generational humor. With a stellar cast and engaging story, it is no surprise that this film was highly anticipated.
The film follows Enola Holmes (Millie Bobby Brown), now with her own detective business, after she is handed her first real case: finding a missing girl. To solve her case, Holmes recruits help from her brother Sherlock Holmes (Henry Cavill) and love interest Tewksbury (Louis Partridge). “Enola Holmes 2” also continues the franchise’ focus on promoting and illustrating the fight for women’s rights: The film is based on the true story of the Matchgirls Strike in 1888 and the legacy of labor activist Sarah Chapman.
Enola Homes resonates with audiences not only because of her connection with Sherlock Holmes, but also due to the whimsical and silly nature of each scene that differs from traditional detective mysteries. The writing of “Enola Homes 2,” however, strips some of this humor away, resulting in a Holmes that is more bland and static than audiences remember. The result is a film that is simply less exciting and engaging than the first, effectively bringing into question the longevity of the series’ charm.
Millie Bobby Brown’s performance, however, prevents the film from fully remaining in the shadow of its successful predecessor. Where the film’s writing falls short of engaging audiences, Brown’s likable charm, engaging mannerisms, and exceptional delivery effectively carries the movie. Brown shines the most in her delivery of quirky one-liners and seamless transitions between dialogue and breaking the fourth wall. In addition, Brown’s youthful, engaging energy is highlighted in each scene and makes the film more exciting and enjoyable — mainly in its contrast to a sense of seriousness found in other detective pieces.
The film also features notable performances from Helena Bonham Carter, Henry Cavill, and Louis Partridge. Carter, who plays the mother of Enola and Sherlock, shines especially in her delivery of snappy dialogue and in her depiction of a strong-willed figure determined to further the fight for women’s rights. Additionally, both Henry Cavill’s and Louis Partridge’s portrayals of their characters complement Brown’s performances well in each scene. By including the well-known Sherlock Holmes, along with a charming love interest, to accompany Enola's expressive personality, the film becomes more dynamic and engaging.
Despite stellar performances, the film fails at living up to the expectations created from the first film. With a slower plot and sporadic editing, “Enola Holmes 2” does not add much to the Holmes canon. The story, especially in the first half of the film, dragged on too long, often featuring long, dull scenes of dialogue and lacking the action that is usually a feature of these films (as Enola Holmes is highly skilled at combat). Transitions between scenes are similarly misplaced and choppy, with each scene seeming to jump to the next too unexpectedly.
While Netflix has not yet confirmed “Enola Holmes 3,” these films are based on The Enola Holmes Mysteries, a book series written by Nancy Springer. The series consists of 9 novels, leaving high promise for the continuation of the Enola Holmes series.

In February 2012, for about two weeks, an undrafted point guard from Harvard took the world by storm, skyrocketing overnight into one of the most famous basketball players in the world. On Nov. 10, everyone from college students to basketball fanatics in the Cambridge community gathered in the Sanders Theatre to view “38 at the Garden” — a short film documenting the rise to fame of Jeremy Lin ’10 — as well as a panel and live video from Lin himself.
The panel that followed the screening of the documentary included director Frank Chi, producers Samir Hernandez and Travon Free, Ash Center director and Harvard Kennedy School professor Archon Fung, and Harvard Government professor Taeku Lee. The panel was moderated by Wenchi Yu, an Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School.
The documentary covers the Cinderella story of Lin’s 2012 stint with the New York Knicks, beginning with background on Lin’s early life before exploring the details of Linsanity leading up to the Knicks’ game against the defending champions Los Angeles Lakers in Madison Square Garden — a team spearheaded by such stars as Kobe Bryant, who was second in the league in scoring during that year. In that game, at the height of his hot streak, Lin topped Bryant with a whopping 38 points. This time period, in which Jeremy Lin led the New York Knicks to 7 consecutive wins and a 9-3 record during the final 12 games before the all-star break, eventually propelling the knicks to the playoffs, was aptly dubbed “Linsanity.”
The documentary featured comments from many celebrities and basketball enthusiasts, including journalist Lisa Ling, comedians Hasan Minhaj, Ronny Cheng, and Lin’s former teammates Iman Shumpert and Tyson Chandler.
Professor Fung noted during the panel discussion that it was important to see Iman Shumpert and Tyson Chandler, two African American men, because their perspectives provide a “great idea of multiculturalism.”
This comment perfectly epitomized the themes of the documentary and the panel: The film isn’t solely about basketball but also representation.
Taeku Lee said that the documentary was “fantastic” and showed how Linsanity was, for any Asian American immigrant, a defining moment “for their sense of possibility.”
Throughout the documentary and the panel discussion, Lin was described as a figure that “broke the matrix,” as Hasan Minhaj says in the film. Director Frank Chi furthered this message by saying that his film highlighted an impossible moment where anything seemed possible.
The documentary also focuses on the less visible parts of life as an Asian American citizen in America. As producer Samir Hernandez said, the film is “for the community, and by the community.” The documentary also covers the rise of anti-Asian hate crimes in America, exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.
Frank Chi explained this further, stating that Part 1 of the documentary is about stereotypes, Part 2 is about what happens when someone shatters those stereotypes in front of the world, and Part 3 is about when those stereotypes are weaponized to promote anti-Asian violence.
Ultimately, the strongest theme of the night was unity and bringing people together. Frank Chi described “38 at the Garden” as a “Multicultural production” and a testament to “saying things out loud.” The documentary is only 38 minutes long, and that was a deliberate choice by producer Travon Free.
“You have 38 minutes to learn about what it’s like to be Asian in America right now,” Free said.
Professor Lee captured the optimistic sentiment of the night best while explaining the difference between hope and uplift — something Lin provided during his magical run.
Uplift is something you need “when you’re down and out, and you need to find a way to look up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lately, Dora Jar has had the circus on her mind. As she brought her propulsive, haunting indie-pop sound to audiences around the country on her first headlining tour this fall, Jar drew inspiration from the surreal beauty of Cirque du Soleil shows, with their synthesis of wild visuals, music, athleticism, and dance.
“It’s a form of art that’s all-encompassing,” she explained in a phone interview with The Harvard Crimson, describing how the shows’ reality-bending narratives “maybe don’t make a lot of galactical sense but hit the intuition chord, and that deep feeling – that sort of dreamlike place within that you can’t really make sense of.”
In her own work, Jar is a sonic wanderer of that same “dreamlike place,” reconstructing its spectral edges in her immersive, genre-defying soundscapes. Since she released her debut EP “Digital Meadow” in 2021, Jar has garnered critical acclaim for the electric, emotive energy that underpins her work, sometimes reminiscent of Fiona Apple, Angel Olsen, or Remi Wolf but in a lane entirely her own. Jar, who opened for Billie Eilish on her tour earlier this year and counts Charli XCX and Elton John among her high-profile fans, has amassed a growing crowd of devoted listeners, who swiftly scooped up tickets for her sold-out Boston show at Cafe 939.
From the percussive thrum of “Digital Meadow” tracks “Polly” and “Wizard” to the foot-bouncing guitars on her 2022 single “It’s Random” and the more subdued mysticism of her latest release “Spell,” Jar’s work moves between styles and modes, striking the aforementioned intuition chord a new way each time.
In her first few releases, Jar has established herself as an adventurous, unpredictable voice in indie music today. But as she emphasizes, she’s not interested in picking a single style to define herself by. “I don’t want to have a sound,” she said, “I want to have an evolution.”
The songs on “Digital Meadow” are as bright and grounded as the EP’s sun-drenched cover, and they arose from her early collaborations with producers in Los Angeles. These sessions were her first opportunity to realize her vision for songs she had written and sat with during the pandemic, and the production reflects the intense focus and excitement of this experience.
Speaking from a tour van headed to her Boston show on Oct. 10, around halfway through her tour, Jar notes that her recent work has been influenced by the newer stress and exhaustion of touring, along with the broader pressure of success in the music world. “I'm trying to figure out: how do I live as an artist in this new context of the industry?” she said, highlighting the importance of “maintaining my own sense of artistry and self that I feel like can so easily get lost in the bigger system.”
If her early releases are daylight tracks, full of light and momentum, her newer songs have a moody midnight resonance, drawing tension from layered vocals and echoing instrumentals. “I’m in an introspective mood with my writing right now, but I’m in an electric vibe with these shows, so it’s a nice paradox,” Jar said. On “Spell,” her latest, ghostly backup vocals cascade over guitars, framing Jar’s warbling voice as the song builds to an otherworldly finish; “Bump” shares its ethereal atmosphere and sky-high register as Jar sings, “All around me is the sound I follow - open hands and holograms.”
Jar’s spellbinding recent sound has emerged from a deliberate, proactive approach to experimentation in the studio — and along the way, she’s found collaborators willing to take creative risks, as she often “has a specific sound in mind” as she puts together a song but doesn’t want to be boxed into one style or mode. The polished, echoing production on her recent releases is a step away from the rawer, more frenetic sound of her earlier recordings, particularly on tracks like “Multiply,” with its crackling vocals and blaring, garage-punk guitar breaks.
More recently, Jar has been familiarizing herself with producing software and looking to further expand her sonic range; as she says, “I’m playing around with Ableton every day and slowly building this new landscape, soundscape, whatever you’d call it, and seeing what happens with that.”
Even as she’s creating and learning on the road, Jar plans to use the break after her tour ends to fully immerse herself in the writing process for her next album, which she expects to create this winter in Poland. To that end, she underscores the importance of stepping away from the hustle and bustle of life – or, as she more vividly describes it, the “modern world of illusions, and fast-paced-ness, and many demands” — to channel her creativity: “I think it’s important that I be very diligent in [saying]: ‘I’m gonna be here, and no one can reach me for this amount of time, and I promise I’ll come back with something.’”
In the meantime, the singer will finish out her U.S. tour, meeting fans in cities around the country. Jar, who was born in New York and grew up in California, is particularly excited for her shows in Chicago and Minneapolis, both places she’s never visited, and the opportunity to connect with her listeners. “I’m excited to meet all the fans in all the new places, and grow the community,” she says. If Jar’s shows are anywhere near as vibrant and distinctive as her catalog (much less her favorite circus performances), she’s sure to find many new fans who will eagerly await the next phase of her artistic evolution.

Indie-boy-next-door Alfie Templeman is creating music completely out-of-this-world while staying true to himself every step of the way.
Approximately a year after his first North American tour, Templeman returned with the May 27 release of his new album, “Mellow Moon.” This time around, Templeman is co-headlining his album tour with fellow pop artist Thomas Headon on their “2 British Friends 1 North America” tour.
The UK artist was signed on by Chess Club Records in 2019 at only fifteen years old, one of his songs blew up on Spotify, attracting the attention of fans and the record label alike. Templeman’s musical journey, however, began even before then. In an interview with The Harvard Crimson, Templeman recalled holding a fascination with music beginning at age eight. “I just got into music. I don't know why, or how, but there was something that clicked in my brain about just music in general,” he said.
Templeman would soon channel his passion for music into creation. As an avid listener of genres as varied as classical music and progressive rock, young Templeman took on the task of attempting to make music himself. He described making music in his childhood with his friend, Jos Shepherd, who is currently on tour with Templeman as a guitarist and vocalist. “I didn’t know how to overdub,” Templeman said, citing a technique that involves layering multiple audio tracks together. “So we used to get in a room together and record songs and put them on CDs.”
“I think [I got into music] mostly because I never really had any other hobbies,” Templeman said jokingly, describing his certainty in turning music into a career. More seriously, he continued: “I was so immersed in it. It was like, one thing I was always destined to do.”
Besides his remarkably young age, Templeman also had a distinctive experience in his instrumental education. Self-taught in at least 11 different instruments, Templeman finds that he has been able to pick up playing techniques in a different way than if he were classically trained. Templeman points out a certain freedom in learning to play music, not by the instruction of a book, but by the personal will of the artist. Method, in turn, affects his product, as Templeman said, “I feel like it gives some kind of character to the music because I’d say I have my own unique way of playing guitar.” Perhaps, he mused, he doesn’t know how to play “normally.”
Templeman involves himself in every facet of his musical production process, both by playing all the instruments on his recent album and by assisting heavily in production duties. Although Templeman enjoys having control over his work, he has found himself becoming more open to collaboration recently. Templeman emphasized the importance of trust when reaching out to producers, something he only does if he likes their music. “It’s different. And it’s exciting,” Templeman said, “I think that’s the coolest thing about collaborating, is it adds a different flavor to your sound.”
At 19, Templeman has released over 40 songs and does not seem to be slowing anytime soon. Templeman has discovered recently whilst touring, however, that he is unable to write songs on the road.
“I was literally saying to myself: I’m not going to tour too much next year,” Templeman said, “I’m gonna focus on writing another album and keeping that mental space.”
For Templeman, this creative process of writing has primarily taken place at his family’s home in Bedfordshire. It was there, during the pandemic, that Templeman wrote songs for “Mellow Moon,” his “nocturnal” process of making music influencing his inspiration for the album’s title. “When I was recording late at night — I’ve got my headphones in, working on songs — the moon’s always signing in,” Templeman said, “And I kind of felt comfort in that. It was kind of the one thing that was with me when I was recording.”
Currently, one of his favorite songs on the album is “Leaving Today,” which he described to have a more mellow tone that creates a “nice moment” during the tour setlist. In it, Templeman sings: “​​Everythin’ I used to be is fadin’ / Far away into that distant time / Now that I forgive myself for changin’ / I can learn to find some peace of mind.”
Although many songs on the album are upbeat and energetic, often featuring spunky tones of a synthesizer and undeniable groove, their lyrical subject-matter can hold more weight. In particular, Templeman takes the space on “Mellow Moon” to discuss his experiences with mental health, after deciding to seek help during the pandemic for his anxiety. Templeman believes that the discussion around mental illness is certainly improving, however, there is a long way to go before people will feel comfortable talking about it openly. Templeman remarks that, in the UK, “There’s signs and posters up in places saying, ‘Talk to someone about mental health,’ but when you actually do and go to a doctor, they don’t do too much.”
This current lack of effective support and resources for mental health is part of the reason why Templeman sings about it. “I know a lot of people that would rather listen to music to help their depression than actually talk to people, because it probably makes more sense to them,” Templeman explained.
Particularly in the music industry, Templeman finds that artists may not always speak their true thoughts on more taboo topics out of fear for their labels — something that he himself has grappled with.
Still, Templeman pursues authenticity in his art. About his hopes for his future music, Templeman said, “Hopefully, I can just be me even more. Like, I’m not saying that I’m not already me, but I feel like it’s baby steps.”
Templeman’s journey is only just beginning as he pushes past the limits — growing, evolving, and embracing the possibilities ahead. “The songs will definitely get weirder,” he said,, “but, you know, I like that.”

Kalos K. Chu ’22-’23, a former Crimson Arts Chair, found his artistic spark at a young age: First as a musician, picking up the violin from an exploratory music program, and later delving into the world of conducting. “I really enjoyed conducting as a method of musical collaboration, it was the perfect way to channel and be the hub of all of this music,” said Chu, reflecting on the events that led to the manifold music director positions that he has since held at Harvard. His seasoned record includes shows as recent as ¡TEATRO!’s fall 2022 “In the Heights” production and stretches all the way back to the 2019 First-Year Musical, “Cruising Altitude,” which he music-directed, and which catapulted his entry into arts communities at Harvard and forged connections that would sustain his next four years of artmaking.
In fact, the 2019 First-Year Musical served as both an inspiration to Chu and as his introduction to the music world at Harvard. Seeing students his age grapple with the abstract concept of creating an original musical — and realizing that these students were able to create something genuinely good — piqued his interest, leading him down a path filled with much more theater than his high school self could have ever imagined.
Today, however, he sees writing as his primary art form. Carrying with him a love of writing and a deliberateness inspired by a high school English teacher, Chu fostered his artistic identity with creative writing classes starting in his first year at Harvard and beyond. Writing the 2022 Hasty Pudding show allowed him to begin to see his creative ideas come to fruition, a process that he would become experienced in over the coming years.
A turning point in his artistic career came during the Covid-19 pandemic. Before that, he envisioned himself writing long-form creative nonfiction for The New Yorker, but the turmoil in his personal and interpersonal life during the Covid-19 pandemic — along with the flexibility and down time offered by quarantine — gave him the freedom to pursue previously vague notions of working in screenwriting and entertainment. He pursued internships in creative development, working to develop ideas for movies and TV shows at DreamWorks, Lucasfilm, and Nickelodeon, which allowed him to improve his understanding of story and nurture that “soft skill,” as he calls it, which would prove valuable in his own creative process.
“I think over time, I sort of grew to understand what that means in terms of what a story is and how to break it down into its parts and isolate the parts that are working and are not working,” Chu said.
Currently, Chu is working on an original project, “OUT,” set to debut in the spring of 2023. The initial idea — the “kernel” of the story — came from the summer after his first year at Harvard during a study abroad in Beijing, where his professor told his class about a popular dating app in China where you can hire people to pretend to be your significant other to take home to your family during the holidays. This idea — which ultimately evolved into a queer story of protagonists struggling to come out to their parents — fascinated him, and started taking shape in his junior year of college. From there, it became an iterative process of fleshing out characters, storylines, and watching the concept grow into an ensemble cast, keeping what worked and scrapping what did not.
Writing is Chu’s favorite way to interact with the world. “I wrote ‘OUT’ because I felt like it was a story that I needed to tell, that I needed to get off my chest and that was baking inside of me for three years, and I think, really, the people who make good art are the people who do it because it's the only thing that they know how to do and the only way that they know how to communicate with the world,” Chu said. But as he said, that’s not the only pull: Creative development is also a fun, collaborative, and interactive experience, especially in animation, where his sights are set post-graduation. Wherever the road takes him, creative work and creative development are certainly in his future.
For others looking to write and put on an original show, Chu’s advice is simple: “just do it.”
“One of the things about Harvard is that I think a lot of times when you do something here you feel like you have to be the best at it or it’s not worth doing, and I think that is the worst idea ever if you are thinking about pursuing art, because there is no sort of standardized metric for what is good art,” he said. He recommends opening the document and just starting to type, because the perfect opportunity will never come. As he says, all the reason to write is that you have a story that needs to be told. “The journey of becoming an artist is silencing those demons within yourself that tell you you can’t do it,” he said.
Chu is adamant that the hardest part of doing arts at Harvard is not getting involved, but staying there. It’s easy to forsake personal interests in favor of what you pragmatically think you should be doing, despite the safety net and employability of a Harvard degree. But the best thing to do as an artist is to fight that urge, persevere in your interests, and to keep making art.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following the 1969 Stonewall Uprising, there was a slow yet sharp change in public consciousness: Audiences were more willing to consume content with queer characters. Though many creators attempted to combat cultural exclusion and social erasure, the prevailing representations of queer Black people from this period were often very speculative and simple, almost symbolic of the dissonance between the acceptance and aversion different parts of American society felt post-Stonewall. Today, most mainstream television writers still heavily rely on simplistic tropes when representing queer Black people in their work. This is not surprising. Television, for the most part, reduces race and sexuality to plot points — the conflict faced by a protagonist coming of age and fantasizing about “freedom.”
Nevertheless, several committed television writers are keeping up the fight to rewrite the landscape of BGLTQ+ representation, and to liberate queer Black actors from the limitations of playing “Black” and “gay,” rather than embodying a complex character. Lena Waithe is one of the writers whose persistence paid off.
After winning an Emmy Award for writing a 2017 episode of Netflix’s “Master of None” based on her own coming-out-story, Waithe was offered the opportunity to realize her semi-autobiographical comedy show “Twenties,” which was first shared in a series of YouTube videos in 2013.
In anticipation of the show's 2020 release, I eagerly revisited the original and obscure four-episode web series authored and acted out by Waithe. The episodes are less than five minutes and bear a resemblance to a solid set of “Saturday Night Live” sketches, presenting witty quips and culturally-relevant commentary. “Twenties,” the short-lived web series, belonged to the entrepreneurial, “DIY”-television era of the 2000s which was more concerned with quality, relatable comedy than excessively educational entertainment; popular web series such as “Lonely Island,” “Broad City,” and “The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl” dominated this digital revolution.
I was excited for what the revitalized, fully-funded version of “Twenties” would offer. And, after finishing the first two seasons of the show, I was impressed and fulfilled. The show possessed a defiant dimension unheard of in Hollywood; it was startling and soul-stirring because of its self and social awareness. While I could commend “Twenties” for its groundbreaking representation of queer Black womanhood, I prefer to not praise the show solely because of the gaps it fills. Instead, I will emphasize that the strength of Waithe’s “Twenties” lies in how it grapples with the issues which afflict the entertainment industry. Specifically, how Waithe attacks the unwarranted acclamation of mediocre and oftentimes reductive Black art.
“Twenties” follows Hattie (Jonica “JoJo” T. Gibbs), a 24-year-old Black masculine-presenting lesbian and an aspiring television writer living in Los Angeles. Throughout the show, she navigates housing insecurity, relationship trouble, and professional development alongside her best friends Marie (Christina Elmore), a television executive, and Nia (Gabrielle Graham), a yoga instructor and aspiring actress. In the pilot episode, Hattie, Marie, and Nia watched a drive-in movie and discussed their feelings on “My Bae,” a fictional show created by Black creative and industry veteran Ida B. (Sophina Brown). “I like that it’s about Black love,” explained Nia. “And I am just glad it exists,” asserted Marie.
Responding to Nia and Marie’s opinions, Hattie said, “Those are not good reasons to like a show.” “We need to support Black shit!” exclaimed Marie. Hattie snapped back “No, we need to support good shit that just happens to be Black.”
As I listened to the three women argue about whether they must support “My Bae” for the purpose of supporting Black art in general, I thought about my own hesitancy to critique Black programming — a dilemma rooted in feelings of “appreciation” and socially-imposed obligation. I feel almost protective of and maternal towards shows which center Black characters, as though they are fragile and would be swiftly taken away from television if I withdraw my support. There is a competitive, unsettling tension between thinking that a show is middling in its quality yet progressive in its representation. But Waithe is well aware of this tension and depicts a nuanced understanding of it.
Later in the “Twenties” pilot, the tension is re-examined through a conflict between Hattie and Ida B. during Hattie’s interview to work as her assistant. After Ida B. asked Hattie why she wanted the position, she confronted Hattie with years worth of Hattie’s own tweets which condemn and mock “My Bae.” Then, Ida B. read aloud one of Hattie’s most provocative criticisms, arguing that “The saddest part about this show is that the people making it think it’s brilliant. But the truth is the direction is weird, the writing is awful, they need somebody to tell them that this ain’t it. Well I guess I gotta be that somebody. Dear Ida B., this ain’t it.”
When Hattie attempted to recant her critiques, Ida B. asked her to be truthful. So, Hattie insisted that the show “sucks” and challenged Ida B. to use her platform to do more than “showing a dope Black woman falling in love with a fake-ass Billy Dee Williams.” Before requesting that Hattie leave, Ida B. told Hattie to wait until she has her own platform. Only then can she create the Black art she wishes to watch.
To me, the exchange between Hattie and Ida B. was especially interesting because, when writing “Twenties,” Waithe was much closer to Ida B.’s position than Hattie’s — and because several of the criticisms cast upon “My Bae” have been aimed at Waithe’s work, too. In this regard, “Twenties” is relentlessly self-aware: Waithe knows that the high standards Black creatives are held to apply to her own creations and that her writing of Hattie, the first Black masculine-presenting lesbian on prime-time television, will be heavily scrutinized for its accuracy and ability.
Since Waithe understands the burden of representation placed upon Black showrunners, her writing in “Twenties” is intentionally complex. Yet, she also satirizes and mocks the notion that “Twenties” must represent vague conceptions of “Blackness” and “queerness,” as neither are monolithic or ​​truly definable.
The discussion surrounding whether Black television writers must fill the gaps in representation and whether Black audiences have an obligation to support unremarkable “Black television” — a genre which I resist as the race of the characters and creators serves as an inadequate unifier — is admittedly complicated. And Waithe’s criticisms, voiced by Hattie, are controversial because Waithe’s creations often offer the same simplistic, stereotypical writing that Hattie opposes. Most recently, Waithe’s “Them,” a drama series released on Amazon Prime in April of 2021, was widely viewed to be an inappropriate exploitation of Black trauma.
“‘Them’ fails not merely because of its opportunism, but because it has nothing particularly intelligent to say about the gratuitous violence and compounding terror it depicts,” wrote Vanity Fair critic Cassie da Costa. Further interrogating the intelligence of the writing in “Them,” Candice Fredrick of TV Guide posed the pointed question: “Who are these characters when they are not actively battling or succumbing to the menace of whiteness?”
The four Black characters in “Them” are reduced to the problems their skin colors provoke. This misrepresentation left me wondering the answer to one query: What would Hattie say about a show so concerned with the white gaze that it refuses to see Black people beyond their persecution?
This is not the first time Waithe was criticized for carelessly misrepresenting Blackness in her work. Four months before the pilot of “Twenties” aired, Waithe and director Melina Matsoukas released “Queen & Slim,” a romantic crime drama which earned average reviews from Black critics. I agree with the assessments which deemed it self-serious, clumsy, and presumptive. During the first and only sex scene between the show’s titular couple, Waithe and Matsoukas continuously cut to shots of a protest taking place somewhere else, in which a Black teenager the couple met earlier in the film shoots and kills a police officer. The juxtaposition wasn’t particularly jarring. Rather, it felt impulsive and overly-concerned with its own aesthetic and political message. But several Black cultural critics — such as Vulture’s Angelica Jade Bastién and The Atlantic’s Hannah Giorgis — who wrote commentaries which resemble my own criticisms were met with backlash: many Black fans of “Queen & Slim” viewed their evaluations as a form of “racial betrayal.”
The concept of “racial betrayal” adds a new dimension to the already complex conversation about what Black people should do about mediocre Black art. Is pointing out the flaws in Black programming problematic, acting as a strange form of Black-on-Black betrayal? Though I think the way Hattie pointed out the flaws in Ida B.’s “My Bae” was excessively critical, I find it problematic to never point them out. And, I find it equally problematic to correlate disagreement or dissatisfaction with disloyalty or disrespect.
Despite my disliking of their use of the word “betrayal,” I admit that the fans presented strong arguments about the potentially problematic aspects of criticizing “Black television”: They cited the obstacles Black people face when navigating Hollywood and the economics of the entertainment industry as reasons Black critics must wholly advocate for and uplift Black creatives. Additionally, the phrase “racial solidarity” was repeatedly called upon. Eventually, Waithe herself joined the discussion and declared that “we haven’t overcome until we can have honest opinions about each other’s work in public.”
She never asked for people to like or support her work because it centers Black people, which revealed her depth and potential as a television writer. “I’m sending love 2 every black critic whether you loved it or hated it. You have the right to write your ass off about it. And y’all have,” tweeted Waithe.
After reflecting on the contents of the contentious Twitter debate, I still struggle to understand the importance of “racial solidarity” and the meaning of “racial betrayal.” I can’t grasp why “racial solidarity” doesn’t allow for authenticity. As a Black aspiring cultural critic, I believe that it’s my responsibility to hold Black art to the same standards as all art, spotlighting the work of Black creatives without granting it unwarranted praise simply because it’s Black. Adhering to Hattie’s assertion in the “Twenties” pilot, I strictly support good art which just happens to be Black — and everyone should. Only then will television move past the simplistic renditions of Black people which both Waithe and I wish to see eliminated from entertainment.

Back on tour after a five-year hiatus, Alvvays (pronounced always), an indie rock pop band based in Toronto, has proven their ability to make instant alt-rock essentials with the release of their third album, “Blue Rev.” Their Nov. 18 show at Boston’s Roadrunner was a flawless — and slightly strange — finale to their U.S. tour.
In one odd moment of the night, lead singer Molly Rankin put her guitar down as the song “Very Online Guy” started. Rankin squatted down, front and center on the stage, and continued to sing the song from that angle. She tucked her silvery blonde hair behind her ears when she looked up, then put her head down and sang directly to the ground. Somehow, her voice projected powerfully around the venue, her stage presence unaffected by the physicality of the moment.
The rest of the songs were played more conventionally. Each piece of the performance came across as well rehearsed and was well integrated. The songs flowed through with thoughtful progression. In both “Adult Diversion” and “Not My Baby,” a riff started off the song before it became recognizable. The band’s timing was impeccable; they always knew exactly when to join in. The songs stuck very closely to the recorded versions, as did the vibe of the band. They dressed like someone’s hipster parents, and mostly in primary colors, matching with all three of their albums covers.
This thoughtful design and practiced accuracy gave them the space for their energy.
The drummer, Sheridan Riley, honed in on this. Dancing along with the crowd to every song, her thick curly hair swung around her face. She counted off every song with excitement. In contrast, Rankin, keyboardist Kerri MacLellan and bassist Abbey Blackwell stayed mostly stoic, letting out a small smile every now and then. Occasionally Rakin bounced a little, or took a step back from the mic, absorbed by the sound of her guitar. The lead guitarist, Alec O’Hanley, didn’t draw much attention to himself. He wore a plain yellow t-shirt and riffed the repetitive patterns that make each of their songs distinct. During “Archie, Marry Me,” O’Hanley took a moment for the iconic solo separating the chorus from the bridge. His solo brought the rock to the pop in this upbeat, rhythmic song.
But the best moments of the show were when the five members put their voices together in different combinations. Their cumulative effort was subtle, but noticeable. MacLellan, Riley and Blackwell harmonized with Rankin, sounding sometimes like an alien echo. Other times, they sang different words and gave the music a spacey feeling.
Setting the mood before the show was the opener, Slow Pulp. All eyes were on lead singer Emily Massey during the set — her soft, raspy voice pulled people in. During the verses, she’d stop playing her guitar and lock her hands behind her back. She raised up on her tippy toes as the pitch got higher.
“If you know this one, sing along,” Massey said to the audience before playing the band’s song “High.” She sang and strummed the guitar on her own for the first verse. As she belted, “I just think I’m too, high” the drums and the ’90s-rock-sounding guitar effects came in. As they all head banged to the chorus, the crowd was swept into the sudden intensity. If the audience didn't listen to them before, they sure do now.
Unlike the dark blues and pinks from the overhead light that gave Slow Pulp such a moody, emotional presence, Alvvays was nearly entirely lighted by the projector that shot out different scenes and patterns for every song. In “After the Earthquake,” the whole band stopped playing and Rankin's voice was accompanied by some keyboard noises with no particular melody that sounded like the wind. Fittingly, the back screen was an ocean.
“Those days, I’d never let you fall apart,” Rankin sang, both hands muting the strings of her guitar.
Then, when the song picked up with violent down strokes from Rankin, and the sudden upbeat drums, the back screen turned into a vintage film of an old dirt road. O’ Keeley soloed on the guitar and the crowd danced.
They played cleanly throughout, and it seemed like every piece of the performance was practiced and practiced again and practiced again. Maybe it's the fact that this was their last show, but it was the cleanness that allowed their eccentric experimentation to work. Each individual melody worked in tandem to create a complex and layered sound. This precise balance and the perfect timing in each of their songs was maintained on the stage.
“Are you awake now?” Rankin screamed.

“Been on the road for three years, just to get here, just to bring it back to Boston,” indie rocker Kurt Vile said as he returned to the stage for an encore at the Royale Nightclub in Boston on Oct. 30.
Vile lived in Boston for two years. In an interview with D’Addario and Co., he shared that in the early 2000s, “I was up in Boston where I didn’t really know anybody. I worked this crappy warehouse job and then I’d go home and just get zoned out and just play.” His connection to Boston fostered an intimate concert experience. Throughout the Royale show, he chatted with the crowd, asking people how they were doing, what they were dressing up as for Halloween (someone in the crowd yelled “you!”), and if an old favorite vinyl store Stereo Jack’s was still around (according to a helpful audience member, it is now in a new location).
Fans don’t go to a Kurt Vile concert to see impressive stage stunts; they go to be transported by his poetic lyrics and guitar genius. It’s impossible not to smile watching Vile in his element as he leans over his guitar to play incredible solos time and again, his long frizzy hair covering his face. His unique guitar style was formed in part by his experience learning to play music on the banjo. “If guitar was my first instrument, I’d go probably take some lessons and then they’d be like, ‘here are the barre chords,’ and you’re kinda stuck in a box, whereas because I started in open tuning there was not those walls,” Vile said.
Vile played a mix of songs from his 2022 album “(watch my moves)” alongside long-time fan favorites like “Pretty Pimpin” on multiple guitars colored red, turquoise, orange, and yellow. He chose to incorporate some of his longer songs, including “Wakin On A Pretty Day” from 2013’s “Wakin On A Pretty Daze” and “Skinny Mini” from 2018’s “Bottle It In” into the setlist.
The set for the night had a slightly grungy feeling with the addition of songs like “Loading Zones” and “The Hunchback.” These darker tracks contrasted with the songs from “(watch my moves),” which have an airy feel and depend on a lighter touch of Vile’s deep voice alongside his mellow yet cathartic chord progressions. The crowd enjoyed the mix, yelling for the songs they recognized, and standing with eyes fixed on the guitarist, trying to take in his wicked fingerpicking skills during the longer songs.
Vile is often in conversation with other artists in his music. In “Cool Water,” the second song he played in his encore and one of the most sonically beautiful songs on “(watch my moves),” Vile references early American Western singing group Sons of the Pioneers, who recorded a song of the same name in 1941. He layers in references to other artists who picked up the song during their own musical careers, including Hank Williams and Marty Robbins.
The musical references continued with Vile’s last song of the night, a cover of “Punks in the Beerlight” by the Silver Jews. The finale of his set offered a homage to the band’s founder, the late David Berman. Vile remembered Berman in a 2019 Instagram post where he said, “His music and lyrics and vocals have touched me to this day and are still growing in significance.” He went on to say that he often sings Silver Jews songs to his daughters before they go to bed, and they have learned some of them by heart. Clearly, for Vile, this was an important tribute.
Vile’s Boston fans were happy to have him back. The feeling was mutual — “I should have been here two years ago and I’m pissed,” Vile said. The blissed-out crowd that came to support Vile on Halloween eve made it clear that they would welcome him back anytime.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In seven states, atheists are constitutionally barred from holding public office.
Arkansas, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas all have state constitutions that list a belief in God as a prerequisite for holding public office. An eighth state, Pennsylvania, suggests atheists may be barred from office on account of their “religious sentiments.”
These bans are, of course, unenforceable, and have been unenforceable for more than 60 years. In 1961, the Supreme Court handed down a unanimous decision in Torcaso v. Watkins, asserting that Maryland’s belief requirement violated the Constitution’s “no religious test” clause. Roy R. Torcaso had been appointed by the governor to serve as a notary public, but was denied his commission because he refused to profess a belief in God. He sued, and (eventually) won.
But that decision has not stopped some particularly motivated individuals from trying to enforce these clauses anyway. In South Carolina in 1992, Herb Silverman’s application to be a notary public was rejected because he had struck through the line “so help me God” on the document. The state Supreme Court eventually ruled in his favor in 1997. In North Carolina in 2009, Asheville city councilor Cecil Bothwell also faced pushback when he assumed his seat without first professing a belief in God.
The Torcaso decision ensured that both of these attempts to enforce the religious tests against atheists were doomed to fail from the beginning. Yet more than six decades after being stripped of their power, these laws are still on the books, inviting challenges such as these that call into question the legitimacy of atheist officials across the country, especially in some of the most religious states in the country where atheists are an even smaller minority.
In this column, I’ve sought to bring attention to some of the specific dangers of Christian Nationalism, ranging from government-funded religious imagery to attacks on secular public education. But there are many issues related to religion that cannot be simply painted with a broad, “Christian Nationalist” brush. Herb Silverman and Cecil Bothwell did not face backlash for their lack of Christianity, but for their lack of belief.
And that backlash does not stem from isolated instances of “Christian Nationalism,” but rather from a culture that has consistently embraced what author Kristina M. Lee terms “theistnormativity,” which she defines as “the normalization of the belief in God as being tied to good and moral citizenship.” Atheists and other nontheists, in this view, are not worth including because they are fundamentally less moral than believers.
This “theistnormativity” is perhaps most apparent in the political realm, where the religiously unaffiliated, despite making up 29 percent of the population, have only one representative in each chamber of Congress. In the House, that representative is Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), who identifies as a “humanist,” one of the many labels variously used by nonreligious Americans. In the Senate, the unaffiliated have Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), but Sinema herself has shied away from identifying too closely with the nonreligious. After her election to Congress in 2012, her spokesperson said that Sinema believed “the terms non-theist, atheist, or nonbeliever [were] not befitting of her life’s work or personal character.”
But the fear of being associated with such godless heathenry is, unfortunately, justified. When asked whether they would vote for a qualified candidate from their party of a certain religious background in 2019, only 60 percent of respondents said they would vote for an atheist. “Atheist” sat below every other religious group polled, including Muslims (66 percent) and evangelicals (80 percent). In a separate poll that year, 69 percent of Americans said that belief in God was important to “being truly American.”
This view, that a belief in God is necessary for living a moral life, is not a “Christian Nationalist” belief like those explored previously in this column. But it is a view that is buttressed by the continued encroachment of religion on our public life. Congress’s 1954 decision to add the words “under God” to the Pledge of Allegiance and their 1955 decision to add “In God We Trust” to American currency advanced this perspective, arguing that America, and its morality, were grounded in a belief in a higher power. Effectively, anyone who did not share that belief was removed from the public identity of the country.
So while these views may not themselves be Christian Nationalist, in a context of rising Christian Nationalism, it is more crucial than ever that we confront them head on. Secular Americans are, and will continue to be, valuable participants in the fight for true respect for America’s rich religious diversity. But that can only happen if we break down the stigmas surrounding nontheism and encourage secular Americans to serve their communities openly as nonreligious Americans. Many secular officials of all backgrounds already are, but it is still a far cry from equal representation.
“Atheism” is not immoral. Neither is “nontheism,” or “humanism,” or “agnosticism,” or any of the people who hold those varied perspectives. But when we let seven states keep laws on the books that directly separate the nonreligious community from the rest of society, we send the message that there is something fundamentally wrong with their views. The nonreligious are becoming an increasingly large part of America’s religious landscape, and fighting the casual condemnation that defines the nonreligious experience is an important step toward guaranteeing respect and appreciation for everyone in the new America.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the beginning of the school year — what seems like eons ago — I took a trip to the eighth floor of the Smith Campus Center searching for information about parking permits and inadvertently walked into an administrative wasteland. Doors upon doors of largely empty offices spanned the corridor, each emblazoned with a name cobbled together from academic-professional buzzwords like “coordinator” and “vice provost.” A few doors vaguely reminded me of emails I had received (and promptly ignored) from various Harvard officials or names thrown around in the search for University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s successor, but most I had never heard of. As I made my way to the Parking Office, I had to ask myself: Where did all these people come from? And do we really need them here?
Concern over administrative bloat has become more salient in recent years as universities, especially elite institutions such as those in the Ivy League, have come under political scrutiny. Rising stars on the right wing have criticized universities as bastions of liberal indoctrination, growing suspicious over the size of endowments like Harvard’s and how exactly such money is spent. After President Joe Biden announced his student loan forgiveness plan, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis railed against universities’ “bloated administrative budgets” and tendency to use high tuition to “expand […] the DEI office.” In response to Harvard advocating against taxes on its endowment, Missouri Senator Josh Hawley tweeted that “Universities have become woke hedge funds with students’ and parents’ money.”
It is no secret that Harvard and its peers have amassed fortunes that are largely kept safe from the clutches of the Internal Revenue Service — apart from the 1.4 percent excise tax created under President Donald Trump, against which Harvard continues to lobby fiercely. Amidst rhetoric among Harvard students calling for higher taxes on large corporations and the wealthiest Americans, it seems strange that Harvard’s $53.2 billion, Yale’s $42.3 billion, and Princeton’s $37.7 billion are left off the hit list.
Ostensibly, universities have this mostly tax-free status because they are charitable institutions serving educational missions, an exemption which dates to one of the first American income tax laws passed in 1894. This status makes sense. Harvard is one of the world’s preeminent universities; surely it has used its billions of dollars of accumulated wealth to primarily invest in its educational program, building an unparalleled roster of top professors, expanding offerings to students, and reducing class sizes. Right?
Wrong. Harvard has instead filled its halls with administrators. Across the University, for every academic employee there are approximately 1.45 administrators. When only considering faculty, this ratio jumps to 3.09. Harvard employs 7,024 total full-time administrators, only slightly fewer than the undergraduate population. What do they all do?
Most administrators have a legitimate function. I will happily concede that the University does need administration to operate effectively. No professors want to handle Title IX compliance or send institution-wide emails about Covid-19 protocols. Yet of the 7,000-strong horde, it seems that many members’ primary purpose is to squander away tax-free money intended for academic work on initiatives, projects, and committees that provide scant value to anyone’s educational experience.
For example, last December, all Faculty of Arts and Sciences affiliates received an email from Dean Claudine Gay announcing the final report of the FAS Task Force on Visual Culture and Signage, a task force itself created by recommendation of the Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging. This task force was composed of 24 members: six students, nine faculty members, and nine administrators. The task force produced a 26-page report divided into seven sections, based upon a survey, focus groups, and 15 separate meetings with over 500 people total. The report dedicated seven pages to its recommendations, which ranged from “Clarify institutional authority over FAS visual culture and signage” to “Create a dynamic program of public art in the FAS.” In response to these recommendations, Dean Gay announced the creation of a new administrative post, the “FAS campus curator,” and a new committee, the “FAS Standing Committee on Visual Culture and Signage.”
Regardless of your stance on the goal of fostering a more inclusive visual culture, the procedural absurdity is clear. A presidential task force led to the creation of an FAS task force which, after expending significant time, effort, and resources, led to the creation of a single administrative job and a committee with almost the exact name as the second task force. I challenge anyone other than the task force members themselves to identify the value created for a single Harvard student’s educational experience.
Such a ridiculous process may seem relatively harmless, but the aggregation of these frivolous, bureaucratic time-and-money-wasters may have made college as outrageously expensive as it is. In 1986, Harvard’s tuition was $10,266 ($27,914 adjusted for inflation). Today, Harvard’s tuition is $52,659, representing an 89 percent increase in real cost. The Harvard education is certainly not 89 percent better than it was 36 short years ago, nor is it 89 percent more difficult to provide. Rather, the increased cost seems to lie within the administration and its tendency to solve problems by hiring even more administrators. In a 25-year timespan within the same window, American colleges added over 500,000 administrators at a hiring rate double that for faculty.
I propose that we cut the bloat. Knock on every office door and fire anyone who does not provide significant utility to the institution.
However — recognizing the impossibility of convincing the Leviathan to purge itself from its eighth-floor lair — we may need legislative solutions as well, such as tying tax-free status and grants to responsible spending or outright raising the endowment tax. I do not know what specific bill will actually slay the bureaucratic beast. Nevertheless, I am hopeful that growing scrutiny on American higher education will eventually deliver our universities from the administration’s clutches and into the worthy hands of those to whom the institutions rightfully belong: students and teachers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While many students vacated their dorms and headed home for Thanksgiving dinner, Saaim A. Khan ’25 opted to hang back on campus and enjoy the quiet.
“It was nice to feel that sense of calm and peace over Cambridge, but I also definitely missed the presence of my friends and people just being around,” Khan said.
Khan was one of many undergraduates who remained at Harvard over the College’s five-day Thanksgiving break. Some cited long and costly flights as deterrents to returning home, while others said they used the break to complete schoolwork and spend time with friends.
Students on campus enjoyed a traditional Thanksgiving meal held in Annenberg Hall on Thursday.
“Thanks should be given to the HUDS workers for making it still feel like I was part of a community and part of a family,” said Hea Pushpraj ’25.
Upperclassman houses and student organizations — including Harvard College Queer Students and Allies — also hosted Friendsgiving dinners and outings for undergraduates on campus.
QSA board member Anna L. Betancourt ’25 said break can be “a really lonely experience.”
“It can be something that’s really hard to watch people leave, because this is kind of our new home here. And it's kind of confusing in that way, especially if this is your only home where you’re accepted,” Betancourt said. “That's just even the more reason why we wanted to create the space for everyone that was still here.”
QSA President Atlas Sanogo ’24, an international student from Canada said they wanted to ensure queer people knew they had a “home” and “chosen family” on campus.
“It can feel very isolating for a lot of queer and trans people who don't have that same ability to go home or just that same welcoming home to go to,” they said. “So, QSA really wanted to step in and make sure that there was something that was happening on campus for people who were around.”
Pushpraj said she chose to spend Thanksgiving at Harvard because the recess was “such a short break.”
“We don’t get the full week off, we only get the end of the week,” said Pushpraj, a Crimson Editorial editor. “It just didn’t make sense dedicating two whole days to travel — both to and from — only to spend three days at home.”
Thanksgiving break comes a few days after the annual Harvard-Yale football game, held this year on Nov. 19. While Yale students are on break for the entire week, Harvard students’ recess did not begin until Wednesday.
“If we had had officially the whole week off, I think that might have changed things in terms of whether or not I would have gone home,” Khan said. “It’s just honestly kind of frustrating that we have school right after Harvard-Yale.”
“It just seems like that even students especially are pretty checked out on Monday, Tuesday of that week,” he said.
Several international students who remained on campus said the five-day break was too short to justify an international flight home.
“Flights are mostly really expensive, and I would say that the break is too short for one to go home,” said Ričards Umbraško ’25, who hails from Latvia. “I would not have the opportunity to spend that much time with my family, and also Thanksgiving is not celebrated back home.”
“Thanksgiving break might be especially tough for international students just because you're so far removed from home at a time when everyone else is going back,” he added.
For Labiba Uddin ’25, staying on campus was “not a big deal” because she plans to return home during winter break in three weeks.
“Most of that was spent studying, but I had a good time,” said Uddin, a Crimson Editorial editor. “I miss my family, of course, but it was still a nice Thanksgiving.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Massachusetts Governor-Elect Maura T. Healey ’92 has tapped five Harvard affiliates to serve on her gubernatorial transition team, which she rolled out Monday.
The transition team, which will be led by Lieutenant Governor-Elect Kimberly Driscoll, consists of six policy committees addressing issues including transportation, housing, climate, and the economy.
Three Harvard faculty members serve on the committees, including Healey’s former Democratic primary rival, University professor Danielle S. Allen.
Healey, the current state attorney general, handily defeated her Republican opponent earlier this month, becoming the first woman elected to the state’s highest office and the first openly lesbian governor in American history. Winning gubernatorial candidates typically stand up transition teams prior to their inauguration that are tasked with identifying political appointees and preparing a policy agenda.
Harvard Kennedy School lecturer Thomas P. Glynn III will serve as co-chair of the committee tasked with working on public transportation and infrastructure. Glynn previously served as CEO of the Massachusetts Port Authority and U.S. deputy secretary of Labor. He also previously led the Harvard Allston Land Company. State Senator Eric P. Lesser ’07, who lost the Democratic primary for lieutenant governor, also sits on the transportation committee.
Harvard Medical School professor Lisa I. Iezzoni, a health policy expert who researches health disparities and disability, was tapped to serve on the affordable housing committee. HMS Pediatrics professor Elsie Taveras will sit on a committee looking at “community health resources,” such as mental health and substance abuse services.
Allen, who leads Harvard’s Edmond & Lily Safra Center for Ethics, will serve on the committee working on economic issues. She ran against Healey in the Democratic gubernatorial primary but dropped out of the race in February. Benjamin B. Downing, who also ran against Healey in the primary, sits on the climate committee. Gina McCarthy, a former climate adviser to President Joe Biden who previously led a climate initiative at the Harvard School of Public Health, will co-chair the climate committee.
Jerry Rubin, a visiting fellow at the Kennedy School, is also serving on the committee working on the economy.
Democrats hold a supermajority in both chambers of the state legislature, giving Healey the opportunity to push forward an ambitious policy agenda.
Driscoll said in a statement Monday the committees will “play a critical role in the important work we are doing to ensure that our administration is ready to begin moving Massachusetts forward on day one.”

Nearly 250 Harvard affiliates signed onto a petition this month calling on the University's Presidential Search Committee to nominate a candidate who “actively affirms the importance of free speech” on campus.
Signatories of the petition, which was addressed to the search committee and Penny S. Pritzker ’81 — the committee’s leader and the senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation — hid their names from the public, though organizers said names would be disclosed to the committee.
More than 200 students, 31 alums, and 11 faculty members signed the letter, per a copy of the petition viewed by The Crimson.
“Harvard’s mission to ‘educate citizens and citizen-leaders’ depends on an environment of open inquiry and criticism,” the petition reads. “But unless the next President shows a firm commitment to protecting free speech at Harvard, that environment will continue to contract.”
The petition alleges free speech protections provided by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Free Speech Guidelines, adopted in 1990, have “often been curtailed,” leading to a “climate of repression.”
Victoria T. Li ’25, a co-organizer of the petition, said she felt the letter was necessitated by a “lack of dialogue” on campus.
“It’s undeniable that we have a culture at Harvard that doesn’t encourage free exchange of ideas in classrooms,” Li said.
Harvard University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on the petition.
The petition cites examples of what the authors described as a “hostility to speech” at Harvard, including backlash against Human Evolutionary Biology lecturer Carole K. Hooven in 2021. During an appearance on a Fox News show, Hooven maintained that only two biological sexes exist and criticized rising pressure for medical school professors to use gender-neutral vocabulary.
According to the petition, Harvard’s intellectual climate has produced “negative and severe” effects on its reputation.
“A Harvard degree is increasingly associated with emotional and intellectual fragility; some employers have even forsworn hiring Harvard graduates,” the petition reads, citing a Wall Street Journal op-ed written by the editor of a conservative religious journal. “Harvard cannot retain the world’s respect if it is seen as an intellectual environment in which dissent from orthodoxy is punished.”
The letter also alleges Harvard’s mandatory Title IX training stifles speech by stressing the role that factors such as gender, age, and size-based discrimination play in perpetuating sexual violence.
“These concerns are certainly understandable,” the petition reads. “But since virtually every proposition about the human condition, whether from the humanities, social sciences, or biomedical sciences, could be construed as unflattering to one group or another, and hence a ‘-phobia’ or ‘system of harm,’ this stigmatization can only discourage honest inquiry.”
The Title IX training figure referenced by the petition, titled the “Power and Control Wheel,” intends to draw attention to modes of discrimination that can produce adverse power dynamics, including ageism, xenophobia, classism, and transphobia.
Shira Z. Hoffer ’25, who signed the petition, said she agreed with the central message of the petition but wished it had further condemned offensive speech.
“It’s unfortunate that free speech has become a buzzword, because I think it’s kind of contrasted with the idea of a safe space,” Hoffer said. “I think that both are possible and important.”
Co-organizer Jacob A. Cremers ’23-’24, who publicized the petition to Harvard undergraduates, said he and Li hid signatories' names to protect those concerned about backlash.
“The potential negatives of signing it are huge. The negatives of not signing it are nothing,” Cremers said. “The positives of signing it are potentially zero — unless they really believe in the cause.”
Hoffer said she believes backlash is a “really legitimate concern,” but said it is “somewhat ironic” that signatories are not taking “ownership of their beliefs.”
Harvey C. Mansfield ’53, a Harvard professor of government, said he signed the petition to target the “fundamental” need for free speech on campus.
“That’s something that liberals and conservatives can agree on,” Mansfield said. “The woke administration that we’ve seen, of politicization and aggressive intolerance — it is something that needs to be replaced.”
Cremers said the organizers plan to send the petition to the Presidential Search Committee by the end of the fall semester.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every Thursday, upperclassmen across the College troop back to their house dining halls for dinner to reconnect with their housemates, hear the week’s announcements, and revel in a space free from interhouse guests during Community Night.
While some students say Community Night encourages quality time with their housemates, others claim the interhouse dining restrictions pose an inconvenience.
The College’s Office of Student Life established Community Nights in 2014, but houses have some autonomy in how they carry out the weekly tradition. Adams House Community Night, for example, features a gong-ringing ceremony where students share their accomplishments from the week.
“Residential life is one of the cornerstones of the Harvard College experience, and Community Nights play an integral role in helping us foster a strong sense of belonging for students within their respective House,” Aaron Goldman, spokesperson for the College, wrote in an emailed statement.
“While interhouse dining remains an option for all other days of the week, we encourage students to take advantage of this opportunity to connect with peers from their House,” Goldman added.
Adams House tutor Henry S. U. Shah ’17 said he thinks Community Nights foster camaraderie in the dining halls.
“I think it's nice to walk into the dining hall and know that everyone is in your house,” Shah, a former Crimson Magazine editor, said. “And it’s only one night a week — I don’t think it’s too much.”
Some students, however, said they doubt all of the College's twelve upperclassman residences are able to similarly foster house spirit through Community Night.
“Adams has their thing. They bring out really nice wine and stuff. I feel like that builds community because people are really gung-ho about it,” Alannah K. Hill ’23 of Kirkland House said. “But I think for a lot of other houses, it’s just more performative.”
Some students in Houses closer to the Yard — which are often crowded due to their central location — said they enjoyed seeing their dining halls emptier on Thursdays.
“It’s never really personally affected me or messed with my night plans,” Caroline H. Dent ’24, an Adams House resident, said. “Although, I do know people with significant others who are like, ‘Damn, my girlfriend eats with me every day and she’s not here because it's Community Night.’ That's difficult, I’m sure.”
But for undergraduates who live in the Quad Houses, Community Night can complicate and inconvenience dining, some students report. On most nights, Quad residents have the option of swiping in for meal access at any river house.
“That just makes it easier if you’re already in the river to eat quickly rather than going back and forth,” Jothi M. Ramaswamy ’24, a Cabot House resident, said.
During Community Nights, however, Quad residents hoping to dine by the river are only allowed to swipe into their designated sister house, prompting some to sneak into more convenient dining halls.
Shah said the impact of Community Nights varies based on where students live and what commitments they have.
“I think the effect is probably felt very acutely by a few people who are athletes and then people who are TFs or CAs on the river on Thursday nights who live in the Quad,” he said.

After starting the season 7-0-0 for the program’s best start in over 30 years, the No. 9 Harvard men’s ice hockey team knew its stiffest test of the campaign thus far awaited them in a Thanksgiving weekend series on the road against the No. 5 Michigan Wolverines. Loaded with top NHL prospects Luke Hughes, Mackie Samoskevich, and Adam Fantilli, Michigan is among the favorites to win the national title this season. In two highly competitive games at Yost Ice Arena in Ann Arbor, Mich., the Wolverines and the Crimson battled to a 4-4 draw on Friday night before Michigan pulled away late on Saturday night to hand Harvard a 4-1 defeat, their first of the year.
“It was a great test for us to come out to play an excellent team with a lot of talent and to play on the road in a real loud and exciting environment,” head coach Ted Donato said. “I think that it was an opportunity for our team to develop and grow and to stress our structure.”
The value of the opportunity to face such a talented out-of-conference team was not lost on the Crimson, which has aspirations of making a deep NCAA tournament run this season.
“I think for us these are the games we want to be in,” said senior defenseman and captain Henry Thrun. “There’s a real value in learning what it takes to be a championship team and how to beat opponents you’ll face in a one game set and out of league that might play a different style.”
MICHIGAN 4, HARVARD 1
Coming off of an overtime game the night before, the Crimson got off to a slow start in the first period on Friday, as Michigan jumped out to an early lead, scoring just over two minutes into the game. After Wolverines defenseman Luca Fantilli made a strong play along the boards to send the puck behind the net, forward Nick Granowicz drove around the net and fired a backhand through the crease, where the puck deflected off a skate right to forward Mark Estapa for the easy tap-in goal. Michigan continued to press throughout the period, with a sustained offensive zone shift drawing a tripping penalty on first-year forward Joe Miller, giving the Wolverines a power play. Harvard survived on the penalty kill despite a close call when Michigan forward Mackie Samoskevich hit the iron, but the Wolverines put together several dominant shifts in a row after the power play. With 30 seconds to play in the first period, Samoskevich tallied his 12th goal of the campaign after one-timing a no-look pass from forward Adam Fantilli, who had been tied up behind the net, past senior goaltender Mitchell Gibson, giving the Wolverines a 2-0 advantage after one period of play.
“That’s a good hockey team, credit to them,” Thrun said. “They have a lot of good players. They’re really dangerous.”
Play evened out in an eventful and, at times, chaotic second period, with Michigan outshooting the Crimson 19-14 in the second frame. Only 15 seconds into the period, sophomore forward Matthew Coronato, fighting for the puck below the goal line, set up junior forward Sean Farrell in the slot, but his one-timer hit the crossbar. Three minutes later, Adam Fantilli, a projected top-five pick in the 2023 NHL Entry Draft, made a series of dazzling moves to weave his way through the Harvard defense and set up a chance for defenseman Seamus Casey, but Gibson stuck with him and denied his backhand opportunity. Both Portillo and Gibson were outstanding throughout the period, with both goaltenders pushing back surges by each offense, and Portillo shut down a late Harvard power play to keep Michigan ahead 2-0 going into the third period.
“We had some really good chances, we just didn’t cash in on them,” Donato said regarding Saturday’s scoring struggles. “Their goaltender made some big saves. We generated a lot of opportunities, we had around 40 shots, we had plenty of out-numbered rush opportunities. A combination of not finding the back of the net, and a good goaltender, probably more than anything else.”
While the Wolverines had an opportunity to extend their lead to 3-0 with an early third period power play, the Crimson’s strong penalty kill notched their sixth shorthanded goal of the season to cut the Harvard deficit to 2-1. With Michigan’s power play unit caught up in the offensive zone, Thrun powered his way down the wing and to the net; although Portillo denied his initial backhand shot, Coronato hammered home the loose puck to give the Crimson some life. However, despite close to six minutes of power play time in the third period, Harvard was unable to find the tying goal, and Wolverines forward Rutger McGroarty, a first-round pick of the NHL’s Winnipeg Jets in the 2022 NHL Draft, tallied a key insurance goal with a snipe from a sharp angle with just under seven minutes to play. Harvard heavily pressured Portillo late in the third with Gibson on the bench for an extra skater, but the Michigan defense withstood the onslaught, and Casey notched an empty-net goal to give the Wolverines a 4-1 win and hand the Crimson its first loss of the season.
“Once we were able to find one we couldn’t click and finish on the goal that we needed,” Thrun said. “We put up 40 shots with a couple grade A’s and maybe a few posts here or there. We definitely had our chances offensively against a pretty good team.”
HARVARD 4, MICHIGAN 4 (OT)
In an evenly matched first period, both Harvard and Michigan traded chances in the early going. Junior forward Alex Laferriere and sophomore forward Zakary Karpa each tested Wolverines goaltender Noah West less than 90 seconds into the game, while Casey and forward Gavin Brindley both had good chances on a Michigan power play six minutes into the game, but Gibson and a blocked shot by Karpa kept the Wolverines off the board. But halfway through the period, Michigan opened the scoring by capitalizing on a Crimson turnover. After collecting a loose puck after a misplay behind the net, forward Dylan Duke found a wide open Adam Fantilli in the slot, who rifled a one-timer past Gibson for the 1-0 lead. However, Harvard evened the score less than four minutes later, as Thrun skated in from the point unabated and beat West with a wrist shot from the top of the circles. The Crimson began an offensive surge after Thrun’s goal, with Coronato putting two shots on West and strong possession play all-around. Less than three minutes after Thrun’s goal, Harvard took the lead after a great play by sophomore defenseman Ian Moore to keep the puck in the offensive zone. Sophomore forward Alex Gaffney retrieved the puck after the keep-in and found Laferriere close to the goal line, and Laferriere fired a one-timer from the sharp angle through West to give the Crimson a 2-1 lead after one period of play.
“​​For us we’ve embodied the motto of a championship standard and really taking it one day and one game at a time,” Thrun said. “We take what happened this weekend, we learn from it and we move on.”
Harvard got off to a strong start in the second frame, putting three shots on West within the first 90 seconds, and the Crimson took the lead at the four minute mark. Senior defenseman Jace Foskey, seeing his first action of the season in place of injured sophomore defenseman Jack Bar, fired a hard shot from the point, and a lively ricochet off of traffic in front of the net went right to Miller, who ripped the rebound into the net to extend the Harvard advantage to 3-1. However, the Wolverines controlled play for the next ten minutes, putting together extended offensive zone shifts and odd-man rushes to pressure the Crimson defense, which blocked 27 shots over the course of the game. Michigan eventually cut the Harvard lead to 3-2 with under three minutes to play in the second period, as defenseman Ethan Edwards warded off senior forward Austin Wong, maneuvered to the middle of the ice, and beat Gibson with a wrist shot, leaving the Crimson up 3-2 at the intermission.
In a frenzied, back-and-forth third period, Harvard struck first on an early power play to grab a two-goal lead. Farrell, stationed in the right wing corner, found Laferriere for a one-timer at the faceoff circle, and while West made the save, Thrun pounced on the rebound and beat West for his second goal of the game, putting the Crimson up 4-2. Down two goals, the Wolverines quickly turned up the heat on offense, putting 18 shots on Gibson in the third period. Less than two minutes after Thrun’s goal, Michigan captain Nolan Moyle crashed the net after a shot from the point by defenseman Johnny Druskinis, and a deflection by forward Philippe Lapointe found Moyle for a tap-in goal, putting the Wolverines down by one goal. Michigan kept its foot on the gas after pulling within one, as Adam Fantilli hit the iron on the power play, and a rush chance with just under seven minutes to play in regulation produced the tying goal for the Wolverines. After entering the offensive zone with speed, McGroarty’s pass from the corner found Brindley behind the net, and Brindley was able to find Lapointe in the slot for a wrist shot that beat two Harvard defenders and Gibson to tie the game at 4-4. Michigan continued to dominate offensively after tying the game, but some timely shot-blocking and great saves from Gibson preserved the 4-4 deadlock, sending the game to overtime.
“Blocking shots is paramount to our success and is something Coach Donato harps on a lot,” Thrun said. “Mitch played great so any help we can offer him is gonna make his job easier.”
The Crimson had a great opportunity to win the game early in overtime after a Coronato breakaway drew a holding penalty on Samoskevich, but Harvard was unable to find the game-winner despite notching six shot attempts while on the man advantage. Gibson denied Michigan’s best chance of overtime when he shut down a Brindley breakaway, and after a scoreless five minutes of overtime, the game ended in an official 4-4 tie. The Crimson won the shootout 2-1, though it had no bearing on the standings or result.
Harvard will have their hands full on another difficult road trip next weekend when they travel to Ithaca, N.Y. next Friday night to take on the Cornell Big Red in the latest installment of the Harvard-Cornell rivalry, before facing the Colgate University Raiders on Saturday night.
“Anytime we go up there to Cornell, it's gonna be a close, low-scoring game regardless of who’s ranked where,” Thrun said. “Probably one of the most difficult games we’re gonna play this year…this is a game that is gonna need buy in from everyone.”

You may have heard that the Barker Cafe recently reopened for the first time since the pandemic started. So, you may be tempted to go. But I’m here to warn you — do not, under any circumstances, visit the Barker Center’s picturesque, sun-dappled, caffeine-oriented rotunda. If for some reason you won’t take my word for it, I’ve compiled a list of reasons why you should avoid the Barker Cafe at all costs.
The Drinks Are Too Delicious
Coffee can be addictive, which is why it’s good that it tastes so (pardon my French) yucky. But for some reason, the masterminds behind the Barker Cafe have found a way to make their espresso deliciously smooth. This is catastrophic for the stellar young minds of Harvard College, which, as we all know, are not yet addicted to the fatal siren-song of caffeine. Save yourself!
The Space Is Too Beautiful
If you think you’ll get work done in the Barker Cafe, you couldn’t be more wrong. You’ll be too busy enjoying the space to think about, I don’t know, economics or whatever. You can’t think when you’re surrounded by windows — that’s a fact.
The Baristas Are Too Cool
Baristas are always overly cool, but the ones at the Barker Cafe are even more intimidating than the average barista because they’re also Harvard students. Imagine messing up your order and then seeing that person in your class later. Scary! Flyby can definitely confirm this because one of our writers is a barista there too, proof enough that the Barker Cafe is too cool for the average plebeian.
It’s Too Expensive
You can’t afford to spend so much money on coffee! You — wait. I’m getting word that you can use BoardPlus there. Shoot. Shoot shoot shoot.
Humanities Students Gatekeep It (but not me though)
Okay, I totally promise that this isn’t why I wrote this article. That would be absurd and a waste of my time. But all those other artsy students definitely will shun you if you didn’t take Hum10. You’ll be a coffee pariah. Best to stay away. I definitely will. Definitely.
Okay, fine. If you’re so determined to visit the Barker Cafe, do it. But if the line is long, don’t blame me. I tried my best here.
