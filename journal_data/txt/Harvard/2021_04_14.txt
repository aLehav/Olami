After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has apparently concluded its review of its relationship to the convicted child sex offender, Jeffrey E. Epstein. In September 2019, after expressing that he “profoundly regret[s]” Harvard’s association with Epstein, University President Lawrence S. Bacow promised “to review how we prevent these situations in the future.” In May 2020, the University released a report completing the first steps of that review. The report found Harvard had taken no money from Epstein after his conviction, though there were further questions that merited study. Two weeks ago, after completing that study, Harvard determined to shutter the research center Epstein’s money had founded, and “disciplin[e]” its academic director.
Yet in these steps, Harvard has still not given us a fair accounting of our past. And worse, in this latest step, it hides that account behind a scapegoat.
There are three chapters in the evolving relationship between academic institutions and Jeffrey Epstein. In the first, before his conviction in 2008, everyone loves Epstein. In the third, after the 2018 article in the Miami Herald detailing his depravity, everyone hates Epstein. But in the second, there is an ambiguous dance between this generous funder and universities that recognize complexity in taking his money.
In 2008, former University President Drew G. Faust resolved that complexity with clarity, but incompletely. Unlike others, such as MIT, Faust determined that Harvard would take no more money from Epstein, according to the May 2020 report. But very much like others, including MIT, she gave no directive about how the many other ways that Epstein was connected to the University should be affected by her determination. In particular, she gave no guidance about how the center that Epstein’s main contribution to Harvard had established, the Program on Evolutionary Dynamics, should negotiate its continued interactions with Epstein.
Because from the start, Epstein was constantly engaged with PED and with others, through PED. According to a letter that Martin A. Nowak, the PED’s academic director, sent to administrators when the center was founded, Harvard’s then-president Lawrence H. Summers got Epstein to pay the rent for PED’s office — not on Harvard’s campus, but in commercial space in Harvard Square. From the beginning, Epstein treated that space as a second office in Cambridge. Epstein traveled to Cambridge regularly to meet with Harvard’s most luminary, including Summers, regularly, but not exclusively, at PED. Those meetings are described as interesting and intellectual in Nowak’s letter. There is no suggestion they involved any inappropriate behavior — beyond, of course, the inappropriateness of including Epstein himself.
These soirees continued long after the 2008 ban on raising Epstein money. The question is why. Some thought the ban would be temporary. Some hoped Epstein’s reputation might be restored. Some believed it morally obligatory to give a criminal a chance at “redemption”; Nowak was told as much by his spiritual advisor, which he shared in his letter to the administration. Whatever the reason, the reality is that there was no real change in the practical relationship that Epstein had to Harvard, beyond his ability to write Harvard a check. The meetings continued; the relationships grew deeper; the conversations on and near campus were many.
What continued as well was PED’s need for money like Epstein’s. PED’s rent was substantial. Nowak reports that at first, after Faust’s ban, Harvard had agreed to assume it. But after the financial crisis, Nowak was informed that he would have to raise it himself. Foundations usually don’t give academic grantees money to cover rent. So everyone knew those additional funds would have to be, like Epstein’s, from private individuals. An FAS development office staff member encouraged Nowak — as late as 2017 — to ask Epstein to ask his friends to help, according to the May 2020 report. Nowak followed Harvard’s direction. Epstein obliged, securing substantial support from his friend Leon D. Black among others.
Throughout this period, apparently no one with any authority — certainly not the University, not its former president, Summers, not its development office, not the dozen or so of Harvard’s most elite — saw any inappropriateness in this ongoing “academic” relationship. Despite the obvious harm that a sex offender could trigger in the members of our community who themselves might have been victims of sex abuse, the elite of Harvard’s elite continued to nurture a relationship with a sex offender. Despite the clarity of all of our views now, they apparently saw no wrong in what all of them were doing then.
At least until chapter three — when all worked diligently to forget what had happened between 2008 and 2018. Harvard’s May 2020 report celebrated Faust’s moral clarity, but it identified some details that required further investigation. In March, Harvard completed that determination. It did not release any public accounting. Instead, its conclusions were shared internally by email to the affected departments. Predictably, that email was leaked.
The effect was completely foreseeable: Airbrushed from the history are the many Harvard luminaries who participated in and encouraged the ongoing relationship with Epstein after 2008. Left standing, alone, is Nowak, PED’s academic director, who is now to be “disciplined.”
And thus we, the community, are allowed the comfortable view that Drew Faust got it right in 2008, and the University followed her lead, even if a very few among us apparently didn’t get the memo.
Yet this framing is absurd, and its lie is revealed in the thinness of the charges against Martin Nowak. Because Nowak has not been punished for associating with Epstein. How could he be, when so many others from Harvard, much more famous and prominent, had associated with Epstein as well? Neither has he been punished because he asked Epstein to help him address PED’s funding needs by securing donations from Epstein’s friend, Leon Black. How could he be, when Harvard’s development office itself asked Nowak to ask Epstein for help?
Rather, Nowak is being disciplined because of offenses that are plainly not offenses at all, or that when committed, were not viewed as anything more than simple mistakes.
The most extraordinary of these is the charge in Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay’s notification to Nowak which states that he “exhibited profound negligence in misrepresenting” the source of PED’s matching funds to one of his funding sources, the Templeton Foundation. This is a gross misrepresentation in itself. The May report had speculated this might have happened, but Nowak's emails with the Templeton Foundation reveal that the precise words used to report his funding were actually requested by the foundation. The Templeton Foundation was neither confused nor misled, meaning there could be no “misrepresentation.”
The balance is just as weak. From the very start, Harvard knew Epstein treated PED as a second office; according to the May 2020 report, Harvard knew as early as 2006 that Epstein even had his own phone! According to Nowak, Summers walked with Epstein as he secured access to PEDs offices with his own keycard. Not once did he or the University say that this access was wrong, or must end. But now Nowak is to be “disciplined” in part because PED gave Epstein a different keycard after the Harvard access system had changed. Sure, I guess one could say that a university-wide change in security protocols was meant to signal to PED that it should stop granting Epstein access to the PED offices. But wouldn’t a memo from the administration have been a clearer (and cheaper) way to send that message?
Finally, Nowak is to be “disciplined” because the center allowed Epstein’s biography to appear on PED’s webpage after Epstein’s publicist requested it. Of course, the story of center benefactors commonly appear on center webpages. But during a period in which Harvard was inviting Jeffrey Epstein to the launch of its capital campaign, and the most elite of the elite at Harvard were regularly meeting with Epstein at PED and around Cambridge, FAS blames Nowak for failing to recognize that it was a misuse of the harvard.edu domain to reveal Epstein as a “friend” of PED.
None of these “offenses” would even have been noticed, but for Harvard’s need to appear vigilant — if only against one of the very many who continued to engage Epstein at Harvard after 2008. That one, its scapegoat.
It was wrong for Harvard to continue any association with Epstein after 2008. No one should be forced to live or work in an environment that celebrates in any way a man who crossed this critical line. Sex abuse is permanent; its victims carry its costs forever; all of them are entitled, at the very least, to an environment that does not trigger retraumatization. To have suffered from the likes of an Epstein and then see Harvard’s most elite feting an Epstein is to add injury to insult.
And this wrong is about much more than funding. It is about the continuing relationship with so many at Harvard. Our accounting for that is wildly incomplete. And it betrays the truth, and a commitment to institutional integrity, to allow Harvard to stand as innocent while one faculty member went rogue.
The story of chapter two at Harvard is not the story of one bad apple. It is of an institution blinded  —  by what? money? brilliance? celebrity? — from what seems to us now as an obvious moral truth. Of course, we were right not to take Epstein’s money after 2008; but we were deeply wrong to continue to celebrate him at Harvard, in all the ways that so many of the most prominent among us did.
That wrong is not excused, or hidden, with a scapegoat. We need an honest accounting of that past and a plan for how Harvard will avoid this failure in the future. Should all criminals be banished, always? Should particular criminals  —  those whose crimes particularly affect members of the Harvard community  —  be banished, always? And by “always,” I don’t mean for any purpose: An event at which a criminal was asked to reflect on at least some crimes or even offer his justifications could be different, at least if properly framed, from a workshop in which the criminal is just one more participant, celebrated only, or especially, because he happens to be rich.
These are hard questions, no doubt, especially in an age of Tweet-length attention spans. But it betrays our tradition to hide from these more complicated questions, simply because some might misunderstand. We are a university that openly and eagerly engaged with a child sex predator, not just before he was convicted, but long after. How did our culture allow this to happen? And how can we now allow this failure to be obscured by scapegoating just one?
Yes, Harvard’s virtue has been signaled  —  to anyone blind to what actually happened right here among us. But the vice of what happened — the open and regular engagement with a sex offender — has not been reckoned here. It is that which Harvard must finally account for, openly, fairly, and honestly.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My younger cousin applied to colleges this year as a member of the incoming Class of 2025. After losing their entire senior year to Covid-19, they began dreaming out loud about a freshman fall filled with enough parties and events to compensate for all they had lost. The desperate yet hopeful pining for a vaccine that would turn everything back to normal sounded painfully familiar to me. As the Class of 2024 lost their admitted students’ days, we pushed our hope onto proms and graduations that were initially set to be postponed. But when those too were canceled, a waning hope was set on our last resort: freshmen fall of college. However, with time, it became evident that this pandemic was not stopping for any of us.
At first, I mourned the loss of my long-fantasized-about experiences. I had planned out the details of my picture-perfect end to high school years in advance. I imagined myself beaming as I walked into each classroom to tell my teachers about all of my college acceptances. I pictured my graduation party, where my relatives would gather together to congratulate me on being the first in the family to attend an Ivy League college. I envisioned a summer finally spent with my best friends after neglecting them for so long in the pursuit of APs, extracurriculars, and college applications. The loss of these moments I had spent years expecting hurt in a way that lingered.
I told myself that it was selfish and frivolous to dwell on these things while so many others were going hungry, losing their homes, and even dying. I told myself that I needed to let these things go. I repeated that thought frequently enough that I eventually began to believe I really had let them go. In reality, I was still holding on to these losses as tightly as ever. They were merely wrapped up in denial thick enough that I wouldn’t cut myself on its edges.
My resentment over what I lost manifested in subtle ways. Even as I was consoling my cousin over the loss of their senior year and saying that I, too, wished for them to get a true freshman fall experience, the tiniest part of myself held me back from complete sincerity. A small, dark corner of my brain hoped that they would also experience the loss of senior spring and freshman fall — it was only fair that if I had to lose both, then they should lose both as well. At first, it was easy enough for me to ignore this feeling. I considered the thought benign since it would never translate into actions — it wasn’t as if I could change the course of the pandemic one way or another.
But every time I talked to my cousin about them starting college in the fall, that ugly wish always reappeared. Rather than sharing in their emotional ups and downs and standing by their side to support them, I kept myself emotionally distant. I became scared that the almost imperceptible distance separating us right now might grow into an emotional divide that would eventually break apart our close relationship.
All it took to change my mindset was the realization that I was lying to myself by acting as if I had let go of my losses. After earnest introspection, my twisted hopes were exposed as the delusions they truly were. It is impossible to gain lasting happiness from others’ suffering, especially from that of the people I love most. I could only gain happiness from their happiness.
I realized that this aimless resentment towards the world was a dangerous feeling to harbor because, without a target to blame, it began to latch onto innocent bystanders. This sort of feeling can come in many forms. It may end up making you resent the friend who got a job offer when you didn’t or the family member who didn’t inherit the same illness as you. This resentment is, at best, unproductive bitterness and, at worst, it can fester into a hatred of progress itself.
Just as I did everything required to get to my senior year of high school, the Class of 2025 has done just as much and deserves just as much and then some. Surviving a full year of online classes in high school and turning out college applications during a particularly competitive and stressful cycle is no small feat. To hope that they get any less than what they’ve earned is willing more unfairness into the world. Life is unfair, but the remedy to unfairness is not more unfairness — it is justice.
To the incoming Class of 2025, I hope that you allow yourself to confront your losses without guilt and properly make peace with them. With mass vaccination rollouts already underway and the official announcement that Harvard is planning for a full return to campus, we have a lot to look forward to. I hope that you feel all the excitement that you deserve to feel before starting college. I hope you find yourself part of a community that you can call home for the next four years.
I hope, with every part of my being, that the Class of 2025 has the best freshman year that Harvard has ever seen. And if there are celebrations, I hope you celebrate hard enough for two classes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Asian American students have had to bear witness to a sickening wave of anti-Asian hate crimes dominating the news for the past few weeks, the culmination of a history of violence and racist tropes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. And when these students needed Harvard’s support the most, Harvard’s Counseling and Mental Health Services plainly failed them.
On CAMHS’s anti-Asian racism resources webpage, grieving students were offered a now-deleted series of insensitive tips, including the following: “You may wish that you weren’t Asian, but remember that your ancestors likely went through similar or even worse incidents.”
These statements aren’t just utterly inappropriate but are also emotionally damaging to Harvard’s AAPI community and entirely antithetical to the role CAMHS is supposed to serve for students. Their propagation only furthers the stereotyping that the AAPI community is trying to combat.
The context that enabled this massive oversight reveals the structural problems that exist within the organization: The insensitive advice, on the website since spring 2020, was drawn from a flyer co-written by a CAMHS intern and was intended to summarize student input from a panel — not to be a response to the Atlanta shooting. Why was this content not reviewed — and subsequently changed — after it was repurposed? How was it up for a whole year without a staff member noticing its flaws? And most disconcertingly, why did no one at CAMHS think to return to this page in the wake of the recent hate crimes when they knew students would be seeking resources?
The consequence of this misstep, in addition to harming students who were seeking help, is that Asian, Asian American, and Pacific Islander students, as well as students of color more broadly, will rightfully feel as though they cannot trust CAMHS to handle issues of race with care — a repercussion that is particularly disastrous for a mental health service in which students already had shaky faith. To that end, CAMHS’s not only inadequate but negligent response to student need also stands in stark contrast to the multitude of student groups who mobilized immediately to provide resources and support to one another and to their communities.
Against this backdrop, we lack confidence that CAMHS is equipped to deal with issues surrounding the intersection of mental health, discrimination, and structural racism.
So where do we go from here? CAMHS needs to start by rebuilding trust with students, especially those in the impacted communities.
At the most basic level, CAHMS should make clear that it is here to listen to students and support them as individuals. It should stop making broad, overly simplistic statements that flatten the rich levels of difference and heterogeneity that exist among its constituents; and it should recognize that no students’ lived experiences or mental health needs deserve to be treated as monolithic. People of color experience and react to racism differently, and painting these experiences with broad strokes only serves to further alienate and isolate students.
More tangibly, we need to see CAMHS hire more diverse staff and offer better training for counselors — especially training that scrutinizes the intersection of racism and mental health — so that students can speak to professionals who are actually equipped to help them. Such developments should, at the very least, incorporate a more nuanced understanding of the disparate ways that structural racism manifests across different racial and ethnic groups’ experiences in the U.S. In this case, for instance, deeper awareness of the model minority myth may have raised red flags about CAMHS’s problematic resources at an earlier point, preventing the outrage and hurt that followed. As it works to correct such missteps moving forward, CAMHS should rely on and curate resources from experts who have researched the intersection of racism and mental health for different groups.
In pledging to work with Harvard’s Office of Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging, CAMHS must also make its intended improvements clear and public in a way that enables them to be held accountable — to show students that change has been made.
Still, these critiques have not been made with the intent to overshadow or trivialize the wonderful people and counselors who do the ever-important work of caring for student mental health. Rather, our frustration rests in the fact that, as an organization, CAMHS has failed our peers in need.
Fundamentally, CAMHS needs to demonstrate the institutional care that would have ensured that a staff member at least glanced at the resource page that they knew students would be visiting in the wake of a racially motivated shooting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of Science Christopher W. Stubbs said reactions to this fall’s campus reopening range from “enthusiastic” to “apprehensive” in the Sciences Division in an interview last week.
As the University prepares for a “new normal” once affiliates widely receive the Covid-19 vaccine, Stubbs said transitioning back to in-person learning will be a significant task for the faculty.
“Harvard is a big, complicated organization with lots and lots of people,” Stubbs said. “You can’t just hit a key on your keyboard, like ‘Harvard on, Harvard off.’”
Stubbs said the return to a fully residential campus would likely be “complicated,” and described science faculty reactions to the reopening plan for next semester as “mixed.”
“We spent the last year telling people, ‘Stay away, stay safe,’ and how do we pivot as an institution to say, ‘We think we understand how to come back and inhabit our new life together’?” Stubbs said.
“That’s a pivot, and it requires — for people who have not been coming to campus regularly — a change in mindset and an adjustment,” Stubbs added.
Stubbs said, however, he is confident about returning to campus next fall, citing the efficacy of approved Covid-19 vaccines.
“I have faith in data — I’m an empirical scientist,” Stubbs said. “I believe that that gives me maneuver room that will allow me to come to campus and do my job with confidence.”
Stubbs acknowledged that on-campus labs have not been able to run at “100 percent efficiency,” limiting what researchers have been able to accomplish over the past year.
However, he pointed to the successful implementation of public health measures within labs as a major success.
“Much of the laboratory research enterprise has, with vigorous safety protocols, been in limited operation for a long time now, and I think we have clearly shown that the workplace that we’ve established is far safer than life off campus in terms of transmission of Covid,” Stubbs said. “Those protocols have been really quite effective.”
Stubbs outlined the Sciences Division’s plans for a safe transition to in-person learning this fall.
“We’re going to embark on some pilot programs in the near future to extend on-campus scholarship, slowly incorporating other groups into the fabric of what we do, and go through the process of training, education, having people understand expectations for safety protocols, enrolling them in our testing program, and ensuring that we have compliance with expectations,” Stubbs said.
Stubbs said he is “guardedly optimistic” that a significant share of Harvard students, faculty, and staff will be vaccinated by the fall to permit a safer return to campus.
“It’s in our individual and collective interest to maximize the number of vaccinated people,” Stubbs said. “That is what is going to get us out of this mess.”
“Get vaccinated, get vaccinated, get vaccinated,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard researcher Donald Yacovone discussed his research on the ways white supremacy permeates textbooks used by American students at a Harvard Medical School event Tuesday.
During the event, Yacovone — an associate at the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research — discussed his upcoming book, “Teaching White Supremacy: The Textbook Battle Over Race in American History.” The Medical School’s Office for Diversity Inclusion and Community Partnership organized the conversation, which was moderated by David J. Harris, managing director of the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice at Harvard Law School.
Yacovone said he did not originally intend to write the book and was initially working on another book about the impact of the anti-slavery movement on the rise of the modern Civil Rights Movement. While conducting research, though, he was “stunned” to discover a 1930 textbook that “had on the first page the blazing title ‘White Man’s History.’”
“As I was reading these books, I’m thinking to myself, ‘My God, this is like a poison in a syringe being injected directly into the young students’ minds,’” Yacovone said. “It was such a devastating shock that I was captured by this project and couldn’t get out."
Although those textbooks are from a previous century, Yacovone said the issue is still pertinent today: old textbooks are still used to teach students today, and it is particularly a problem for the roughly 5 percent of young school-aged children who are homeschooled and whose parents find resources online.
More recent textbooks continue to inaccurately teach the history of slavery in America, according to Yacovone. Some Texas textbooks described slaves as “workers” and attribute the cause of the Civil War to secession, not slavery, Yacovone said. Outside of textbooks, Yacovone said some classroom activities and school curricula inaccurately and inappropriately educate children about slavery. Up until this year, schools in states including New York and New Jersey conducted classroom activities in which students reenacted slave auctions, per Yacovone.
“In Watertown, New York, the teacher of a fourth grade class ordered a Black boy and girl to stand in front of their white classmates with their hands behind their backs, just as ‘in slave times,’” he said, referring to a 2019 incident. “The teacher then announced that the slaves tried to escape, but they would be chased down and violence would be done to them. The follow-up investigation of the incident revealed lasting emotional harm to the two students.”
Yacovone acknowledged the challenge of changing the way American school systems teach about the history of white supremacy and slavery.
“This is a terribly difficult and complicated problem because we have 50 states and 50 different complex series of regulations to govern what gets taught and who gets to teach it,” he said. “Above that, it’s the training of those people who, I think, either as teachers and as administrators, need this kind of understanding of the racial background that they will deal with [and] will impart to their students.”
Yacovone ended his presentation by underscoring the lasting impacts of textbooks.
“One cannot overemphasize the impact of school textbooks or modern electronic resources — especially modern electronic resources — whether teachers use them or not,” Yacovone said. “As the famed author of ‘The Education of Henry Adams’ reminds us, parents give life, a killer can take a life, but ‘his deed stops there. The teacher affects eternity and he can never tell where his influence stops.’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mohammad S. Jalali — the principal investigator for a joint simulation modeling project between Harvard researchers and the Food and Drug Administration — presented his lab’s ongoing efforts to accurately model the opioid crisis during a Harvard School of Public Health seminar on Tuesday.
Hosted by the Center for Health Decision Science, the event outlined existing research on opioid usage in America, the model’s development, and tentative results. Health policy professor Joseph S. Pliskin and senior research scientist Lisa A. Robinson served as moderators.
Due to agreements with the FDA, however, the model’s results must remain confidential to the public until publication in roughly four months, according to Jalali.
In an interview after the seminar, Jalali said he believes opioids constitute one of the largest public health emergencies the country faces.
“The opioid crisis is such a complex problem,” he said. “It's the second biggest crisis that we are dealing with after Covid-19, which is affecting a lot of lives.”
Opioids include prescription painkillers like morphine, as well as illicit drugs such as heroin.
Jalali described the opioid crisis as a multi-layered system that includes the health of the individual, those around them, the illicit drug market, legal prescription practices, and the larger healthcare and justice systems. Owing to the complexity of the problem, he said designing and implementing a good intervention or policy strategy is difficult.
“To solve the problem, you have to take a systematic approach,” he said. “You have to understand that if you make an input or a major change in one part of the system, other parts of the system might also be affected.”
To account for that interdependence, Jalali’s research team created a comprehensive “systems model” to mathematically and computationally describe how the layers of the opioid crisis interact.
“The model is tracking the trajectories of opioid use, including initiation, misuse, opioid, heroin and fentanyl disorder development, overdose deaths, remission, and relapse,” he said.
While taking a systems modeling approach to understanding opioid usage is not a new concept, Jalali and his multidisciplinary team from Harvard, MIT, Stanford and the University of Washington considered a much larger data set than previous research efforts, per Jalali.
The model’s increased scope also allowed Jalali and his team to observe “important mechanisms” that previous smaller scale research was unable to capture. Those include feedback loops, social influences, and how the perception of risk varies in different populations.
Jalali added that the model is “grounded in the literature” and “data-driven.”
“The model is ultimately able to replicate historical data, and it can help us explain what's going on,” he said.
Once published, Jalali said he hopes the model will “inform national policymaking” and “high-level population-based decision making” regarding responses to the opioid crisis. He added the FDA will also use the model to inform and expand its “decision making process.”
Though opioid overdoses kill roughly 50,000 people in the U.S. every year, Jalali said these overdoses are only “the tip of the iceberg” when it comes to the opioid crisis in America.
“For every person who dies, there are hundreds more suffering from addiction, or at risk of it,” he said. “Every person who dies and every family ravaged by addiction is a real human tragedy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Shyanne A. Gardner was at the beach watching the sunset last Tuesday with her friends when 7 p.m. — the time for Harvard’s admissions decision release — finally arrived. After asking her friend whether she should check her admissions decision, Gardner ultimately decided to open her application portal.
She was immediately greeted with a video of students bedecked in Harvard paraphernalia boisterously waving “congratulations” signs.
“I was really nervous, but I was like, ‘It’s fine. It’s fine. It won’t even matter because I’m probably not going to get in,’” Gardner, a student from Freeport N.Y., said. “I wasn’t expecting it. I’ve seen decision videos where people start screaming and crying and running around, and I didn’t exactly do that. It was literally because I was in shock.”
Gardner joined 1,222 other students admitted to Harvard College in the regular decision cycle Tuesday. The College accepted 1,968 students total from a pool of 57,435 applicants, marking a record-low 3.43 percent of applicants admitted.
Allison “Ally” Chun, a prospective member of the Class of 2025 from Nanuet, N.Y., said receiving an acceptance after being deferred from the early action cycle was “a relief.”
“Because I got deferred, I had no expectation of getting into Harvard,” Chun said. “So when I saw the ‘Congratulations,’ I was crying, I was ballistic, I was in tears.”
Chun, who said she submitted an SAT score in her application, said she believes the test-optional policy allowed colleges to use a more holistic admissions process.
“For the non-SAT requirement, it was really good for allowing the college admissions process to look at the student holistically, and not just at grades,” Chun said.
Gardner said she was appreciative of the College’s decision to admit a full class of students to the Class of 2025 in addition to accommodating the 349 students who deferred admission from the Class of 2024.
“I think what the admissions department was looking to do was to give as many people as possible the opportunity to study at Harvard,” Gardner said. “If they had lowered the amount of people accepted, maybe I wouldn’t have been accepted, or some of the friends that I’ve made so far wouldn’t be going to that school this year.”
Aleksandra Denisenkov — an international student from St. Petersburg, Russia and a recruited athlete for the women’s swim team from the Class of 2024 who deferred to the Class of 2025 — said “it’s great because all of them deserve it” when asked about Harvard’s decision to admit a full class.
“They deserve to be there, I’m sure. They have a right to be there. And it shouldn't depend on our [Class of 2024 students] decision to defer last year,” she said. “So Harvard did well.”
Amy T. Liu, a Class of 2025 admit from Central Bucks High School South in Warrington, Pa., said she is most excited to meet her peers.
“It can be really isolating to just go through school and your daily activities, not being surrounded by peers,” she said. “So I’m super excited, even though a lot of the admitted students events — they’re all virtual.”
Dara C. Adamolekun, a Class of 2025 admit from Arlington High School in Arlington, Tenn., said getting into Harvard or any other selective school “doesn’t really define the work you did before."
“It’s just an accolade, or extension of what you’ve done,” she said. “But that doesn’t mean had I not gotten it, then all of a sudden that my work wasn’t validated. I just hope people understand that there’s not a university that can make you.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School’s International Human Rights Clinic secured a historic victory last Monday as a federal judge turned down former Bolivian president Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada and former defense minister José Carlos Sánchez Berzaín’s request to reverse a $10 million judgment against them for the massacre of Indigenous people in 2003.
Then HLS second-year student Thomas B. Becker brought the case to the clinic in 2006, and lawyers there, alongside other nonprofits and private law firms, filed the original suit on behalf of 10 members of Bolivia’s Indigenous population the following year. In a landmark decision in 2018, an American jury found the two Bolivian officials responsible for the extrajudicial killings. District Judge James I. Cohn reaffirmed that decision on April 5.
Before attending law school, Becker — who is now an attorney for the University Network for Human Rights — spent time in Bolivia and investigated the history of “Black October,” a military massacre that left more than 50 dead and more than 400 injured amid protests over gas exports.
During his first year at the Law School, in a human rights course, Becker learned about the Alien Tort Statute, a centuries-old provision in U.S. federal law that had largely been forgotten. The statute would become an instrumental force in Becker and the Law School’s legal case against the former Bolivian officials, who currently reside in the U.S. after fleeing their home country.
“We really just briefly learned about it in passing in class, but it stuck with me,” Becker said. “When I returned to Bolivia after my 1L year — I went down to work with the families — we explored the idea of, ‘Maybe let’s try to bring a case in the U.S.’”
In the summer of 2006, he called Jim L. Cavallaro ’84, then the director of the International Human Rights Clinic, and Tyler Giannini, the clinic’s current co-director, about the possibility of bringing forth a case.
“We spent the next year or so taking many trips back and forth to Bolivia, doing interviews, gathering documentation, and building a case,” Becker said. “When it became very clear that there was far more than enough evidence showing the responsibility of these people, we filed a lawsuit in 2007.”
Giannini said he still remembers the details of the call and Becker’s ability to “capture and bridge” the plight of the Indigenous communities to the attorneys leading the clinic.
“These cases are long-term cases, they always are,” Giannini said. “But he really saw the second side of the angle, which was not just that you had the communities who wanted justice, but he also saw the injustice of having the two defendants living in the United States.”
International Human Rights Clinic co-director Susan H. Farbstein said much of the case was “driven and led by the plaintiffs.”
“Their tireless commitment and their optimism are sort of what have allowed us to get to this point,” Farbstein said. “It just wouldn’t be possible without them, without their vision, without their energy — that’s one really important part of the story for me, is how they’ve just never given up.”
Becker said he heard the news from a colleague at the Center for Constitutional Rights — another organization that was involved in the case — while on a jog as part of his training to climb Mount Denali in a few weeks.
“That certainly interrupted my climb for the day,” Becker said. “I ran home, glanced at the decision of the judge, and then called the families, in part because certainly it was exciting for me, but I can’t imagine what they were feeling.”
The plaintiffs in the case, Becker said, are members of Bolivia’s Indigenous population from “humble backgrounds” who have faced continuous racism from the rest of their country. The case is named for two of the plaintiffs, Etelvina Ramos Mamani and Eloy Rojas Mamani, whose 8-year-old daughter was killed during the massacre.
For these individuals to have held the former Bolivian president accountable, Becker said, is a historic win for human rights law everywhere.
“When we started this case, honestly everybody said, ‘You guys are crazy, you cannot touch Goni,’” Becker said, using a common nickname for Sánchez de Lozada. “The families basically said, ‘We don’t care. No one should be able to do what this man did, and we will follow him to the United States.’”
Sondra R. P. Anton, a second-year law student and incoming Co-President of HLS Advocates for Human Rights, said that the case's outcome is a testament to the “bravery and the resilience” of the survivors and plaintiffs as well as the character of the clinic’s leaders.
“These are people who embody what it means to be an impactful human rights lawyer — humility, compassion, dedication to survivors, this willingness to embrace the thought that if something sounds crazy, then it’s probably worth pursuing,” Anton said.
Giannini said he believes one of the most important takeaways from the case is that justice is not limited to a particular geographic region.
“The killings and the violence happened in Bolivia, but we had a U.S. jury. They really got it, they understood,” Giannini said. “In a human rights arena, we sometimes get questions of, ‘Does justice travel?’ This shows that it does.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Brenda D. Tindal will serve as the new executive director of the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay announced Tuesday.
As executive director of HMSC, Tindal will oversee the six research museums of the FAS, which include the Harvard Museum of the Ancient Near East, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology, University Herbaria, the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments, and the Mineralogical and Geological Museum.
Tindal said in an interview with the Harvard Gazette that she is “honored” to step into her new role at HMSC and looks forward to interacting with undergraduate students and faculty.
“I believe museums are essential parts of the learning ecosystem, and the opportunity to be back on a college campus and leverage Harvard’s extensive collections — I’m just thrilled at all of the possibilities,” Tindal said.
Gay wrote in her emailed announcement that Tindal “brings to her work a heartfelt belief in the power of museums as profound sites of connection and new learning.”
“Throughout her career, she has prioritized meaningful civic dialogue and learning among broad and diverse audiences and has skillfully built the trusted partnerships and authentic community relationships needed to center museums in advancing public knowledge,” Gay wrote.
Tindal will officially step into her new role on May 17. She joins the FAS from the International African American Museum in Charleston, S.C., where she served as founding director of education and engagement.
In her Tuesday email, Gay highlighted Tindal’s work at the IAAM to develop educational programming focused on “the untold stories of the African American journey, from slavery through the 20th-century civil rights movement to the present.”
“As a museum leader, Brenda’s work champions the perspective of descendant communities, which informs her thinking about the unique contributions of museums in representing authentic narratives of the past that both expand public understanding of our shared history and enliven and contextualize that of our present and future,” Gay wrote.
Tindal has also previously held positions at the Levine Museum of the New South and the Detroit Historical Society.
Harvard’s museum collections have come under increased scrutiny this year. In late January, University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced that an internal review of the Peabody Museum found that the museum houses the remains of 15 individuals of African descent who were likely alive during the time of slavery in the United States. Bacow also announced the formation of a steering committee tasked with creating “a comprehensive survey of human remains” across all Harvard museums.
In early March, a Middlesex Superior Court judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by Tamara K. Lanier against Harvard alleging that the University unlawfully possesses and profits from historic photos she says depict her enslaved ancestors. Lanier says she plans to appeal the case.
Later the same month, Peabody Museum administrators issued a public apology after the Association on American Indian Affairs penned a letter to Bacow accusing the museum of several legal and ethical missteps in its handling of Native American human remains and cultural objects.
Tindal said in her interview with the Gazette that she has “encountered and had to navigate a number of challenging and sensitive” issues during her time at IAMM, the Levine, and other museums — experience which will inform her work at Harvard.
“There are so many unique opportunities to engage with the museums and deepen connections,” Tindal said. “Museums are not merely cabinets of curiosity; they are well-positioned to serve as hubs for new learning and play a meaningful role in helping their communities and stakeholders grapple with hard truths and nuanced issues.”
“I’m honored to join this community of scholars and museum practitioners, and I look forward to building upon HMSC’s interdisciplinary prowess and its robust, public-facing enterprise,” Tindal added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard School of Public Health Dean Michelle A. Williams said in an interview she was “inspired” to co-found the COVID Collaborative — a coalition of leading health and economic experts promoting comprehensive public health policies — in an effort to help direct local and national responses to the coronavirus pandemic.
The COVID Collaborative is a coalition of health experts, economic leaders, and educators promoting sustainable and comprehensive policies affecting the public’s health.
The initiative was founded to remedy a disjointed national response to the pandemic, according to COVID Collaborative’s co-founder and CEO John M. Bridgeland ’82, former director of the White House Domestic Policy Council.
“I was struck by the fact that in a time of crisis, there wasn't strong presidential leadership, and there wasn't a clear national plan,” Bridgeland said.
In December, the COVID Collaborative issued a list of recommendations to policymakers titled “Call to Action to Defeat COVID-19 and Promote National Recovery and Renewal.” The list recommends common, comprehensive action across all states in five critical areas: testing, contact tracing, public health and social measures, vaccines and treatments, and common indicators of success.
A bipartisan group of governors representing one-third of Americans issued support for the recommendations at the end of 2020, marking the first bipartisan collaboration to address Covid-19 since the onset of the pandemic, per a press release published by the Collaborative.
Howard K. Koh, a national advisor for the Collaborative and HSPH professor of the practice of public health leadership, said the initiative has centered its focus on increasing vaccination rates through public education efforts, especially among high-risk populations.
“The group has led lots of efforts that have trusted messengers from all sectors of society come forward and send a unified message that vaccinations are life-saving and a way of helping your family and your society right now,” Koh said.
Williams said she believes there is a “structural flaw” in the way government and institutions are currently communicating health risks and responses.
“We tend to design the messages for middle-class America, and when we do that, we forget the very people who are the most vulnerable,” she said. “They are the afterthought.”
The Collaborative launched a $50 million vaccination education campaign in partnership with the Ad Council that aims to provide scientifically-backed and culturally-informed vaccine messaging, especially to people of color.
“The current emphasis, of course, is getting vaccination rates as high as possible so the country can achieve herd immunity,” Koh said. “And if we do that, we can have a chance to return to some sense of normalcy.”
The overarching goal of the Collaborative is not only to enhance the country’s Covid-19 response but also to bring together people of various backgrounds and political affiliations so they can work in tandem to address future crises, according to Bridgeland.
“We also have the ambition, that underlines all this, to transcend politics and to show that Americans across politics and difference and race and ethnicity and background can come together in common purpose to solve and hack tough problems,” Bridgeland said.
In addition to crossing “political boundaries,” Williams noted the Collective's desire to engage academics across disciplines and bridge the gap between the public and private sector.
“We wanted to engage the corporate voice, and then we wanted to really demonstrate that we as an academic body can partner with all other sectors, and bring the best of science, unlock the knowledge the capacity that exists in our universities, and bring it down to the level of the community because that’s what we should be doing every day,” Williams said.
Koh similarly noted that the Collaborative’s efforts draw on the work of countless individuals across various fields.
“I'm just one of many soldiers in the army,” Koh said.

Mary Louise Kelly ’93 and Tracy Palandjian ’93 aren’t in the same profession today, but their lives were intertwined as Harvard undergraduates. Kelly is now co-host of All Things Considered on NPR, and Palandjian is the co-founder of Social Finance, the impact investing nonprofit, and former vice chair of the Harvard Board of Overseers.
While in college, Kelly wrote for The Harvard Crimson, and Palandjian worked in the Eliot House Grille. The two were “honorary roommates” in the house—members of a tight-knit friend group that continues to gather annually.
