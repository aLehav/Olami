After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hot breakfast can be an irreplaceable occasion—just ask the 3,500 notables who attended the National Prayer Breakfast last week. The event, which was attended by Congressmen, diplomats, religious, business and military leaders, and President Barack Obama, is held annually at the Washington Hilton in order to help these leaders make cross-field connections that they otherwise might not. Yet the event is not without controversy; The Fellowship Foundation, a “secretive evangelical Christian network,” also known as The Family, sponsors the event. Though high-level politicians on both sides of the aisle have frequented the organization’s events, it has caused quite a stir among gay-rights and other activists—among other homophobic and xenophobic actions, The Family has recently been connected with a Ugandan legislator who is sponsoring a bill calling for the imprisonment or execution of homosexuals. We agree that The Family’s objectives and the manner in which they try to achieve them are reprehensible. Yet, although many activists called on Obama to boycott the National Prayer Breakfast in order to demonstrate his opposition to The Family’s goals, we believe that he made the correct decision in attending the event. The best way to stop The Family’s influence is to stand up to them and reprimand them directly.
Administrators of The Family have been documented using dangerous rhetorical devices to compel the loyalty of followers. Doug Coe, its leader, has compared the blind devotion demanded by Jesus—and thus by one of its interlocutors on Earth, The Family, to that demanded by Adolf Hilter, Joseph Goebbels, Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong, thus legitimizing the latter tyrants. Such untempered comparison is irresponsible, dangerous, and wrong. It leads to such invidious situations as The Family’s accused support for Ugandan politician David Bahati, who is proposing a bill containing the death penalty for HIV-infected people who have sex with someone of the same gender. Although The Family has since distanced itself from this scandal, one of its members could very easily follow its logic to support this bill.
Yet boycotting an event sponsored by the National Prayer Breakfast would not have been the best way for Obama to declare his views in opposition to the ones linked to The Family. Obama made a wise decision in attending the breakfast and using it as an occasion to to declare, “It is unconscionable to target gays and lesbians for who they are—whether it's here in the United States or…more extremely in odious laws that are being proposed most recently in Uganda.” Going to the breakfast was the best way for the president to disseminate this view to the exact people who needed to hear it the most. If Obama had boycotted the breakfast, The Family’s shady and inappropriate tenets would perhaps never have been chastised so publicly by the leader of our nation.
Some protestors called for the complete dissolution of the National Prayer Breakfast, claiming that the separation of church and state means Obama should not listen to religious leaders. Yet religious voices need to be heard by the president as much as the voices of any other group of people. Other constituency groups such as businesses, gender-based groups, and race-based groups receive opportunities to consult with political leaders in a personal setting, and it would be unfair for those who choose religion as their primary affiliation to not have the same opportunity.
However, the National Prayer Breakfast does create an uncomfortable pressure for attendees to support religious groups and religion in general. Inherent in the word “prayer” is the assumption that one’s spiritual choices involve supplicating a higher being. This is discomfiting to atheists and others whose religious beliefs do not involve praying to a God. This nominal objection is important because, in a country with a commitment to the separation of church and state, for any group to be disadvantaged or not included in the breakfast by virtue of their lack of faith in God, would be unfair. This event was meant to be an occasion to promote inclusivity and concord, and it would be sadly ironic if it ended up doing the opposite.
Whether or not religious leaders continue to meet with the president in the format of a National Prayer Breakfast, an organization as discriminating and prejudiced as The Family should not be allowed to sponsor such an event in the future. The U.S. Congress technically hosts the National Prayer Breakfast, and we urge it to choose other, less embattled organizers for such occasions. There are other faith-based groups that do not share such extreme, antagonizing views as The Family, and they would be more suited to head an event primarily dedicated to friendship building. Although Obama made the right decision in attending the National Prayer Breakfast, there should not have been reason for him to consider a boycott at all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It has begun. No, the torch has not yet been lit, and NBC has not yet commenced its features on inspiring athletes, but the buzz around this year’s winter Olympics in Vancouver has already started. Just last week, Sports Illustrated came under fire for running a controversial cover featuring American skier Lindsey Vonn in what many are calling a sexually provocative pose. While that story will most likely fade from the public’s consciousness as Vonn’s actual skiing begins, there will inevitably still be plenty of controversy surrounding many of the other events taking place this year, most of it probably revolving around the question of whether or not this or that is actually a sport. This query may be directed toward the biathalon, the strange combination of cross-country skiing and riflery, or perhaps it will be directed toward everyone’s favorite winter Olympic oddity: curling.
No matter what sport may cause you to think twice about tuning in this February, the rules mandating which sports are allowed and which are disallowed in the Olympics have little to do with the merits of the sports themselves. Like everything else in the Olympics, they are about two things and two things only—politics and the worldwide desire to win. This unpleasant reality is made most clear not by the sports that are played in Olympics but by those that are left out.
Two of the most notable absences from the 2012 summer games in London will be baseball and softball, both of which were voted out by the International Olympic Committee in 2005. The reason that was given for these omissions was that neither sport figured largely enough in the international sporting world. However, baseball and softball are two of the most played sports in the world, with huge followings in North America, the Caribbean, and Asia. Although there would have been many flags represented on the field had these sports been offered in the 2012 games, it was the specter of the stars and stripes that got baseball and softball kicked out of the Olympics.
Ever since softball had first been introduced into the Olympics in 1996, the US had won three of the first four gold medals, leading many to believe that a sport so dominated by one country had no place in an international competition. This logic represents a flaw in the management of Olympic sports. The goal of the games is to bring the world and its greatest athletes together, not to remove sports that have been won almost exclusively by a single country. In the 2008 games, China swept all three medals of the table tennis tournaments, and yet no action will be taken to rectify this—nor should any action be taken. Furthermore, much of the world is physically incapable of playing or training for many winter sports, but that does not mean these events should be ruled out. The excellence of one country’s team—or any group for that matter—should allow that team to compete at the highest level, not facilitate its exit. In fact, it is the domination of certain sports that often garner the most fanfare. For example, no story loomed larger in Beijing than Michael Phelps, the American swimmer who won the gold in all eight of his events. Removing him from the competition would rightly appear ludicrous, but it is the same logic that would mandate such a farce that results in the removal of whole sports.
We all naturally want our country and our athletes to win. It is hard not to root for the American athlete in any event, even when one has never heard of him or her. All that matters is that they are wearing the American uniform. Paramount to this sentiment, however, is the sport itself. We should never let our patriotic desire to win the most medals—a count that proves little—alter the way we permit or prohibit certain sports.
Conversely, the Olympics can play a positive role by serving as an introduction of many foreign sports to the rest of the world, highlighting games that other countries can adopt, learn, and come to cherish. Even though handball may not be the next big craze in your hometown gym, the Olympics should still keep it on its roster.  Like other, far more obscure, sports, it is popular in many countries, and the best of its ranks deserve to play for a medal as much as the best biathletes and curlers do.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If Tocqueville had been born a black woman, what would she have said about America? Social studies concentrators will never know. Those who have taken the concentration’s much-feared introductory social theory course, Social Studies 10, know that the syllabus is comprised almost exclusively of white, European, heterosexual male theorists. The strikingly homogenous syllabus speaks to the existence of a social studies ideology that we—all Harvard students—should not accept.
A major argument against including more female and nonwhite writers on the Social Studies 10 syllabus calls attention to the course description’s stated mission. Social Studies 10 is, according to the course description, a study of classic texts; as such, it bears no responsibility to diversify and perhaps shouldn’t. This argument, however, is complicated by the fact that Social Studies 10 is one of the only courses required of all concentrators and thus binds together an otherwise loosely-defined humanities concentration.
Although its stated mission may be to introduce students to classic social theory texts, Social Studies 10’s academic function is to equip students with the tools the department deems absolutely necessary to understanding one’s focus field—an interdisciplinary specialty area about which concentrators ultimately write their theses. Social studies concentrators are required to read Hayek, Polanyi and Marx in Social Studies 10 because exposure to major economic theories is considered necessary to confront issues relevant to all concentrators’ theses and focus fields. But, by not including gender theory or postcolonial theory on the course syllabus, the department communicates that these approaches are not essential to understanding the same topics.
Embedded in these highly subjective decisions exists a social studies ideology. Because Social Studies 10 provides concentrators with a common set of tools for confronting social issues and phenomena, not including gender theorists or postcolonial theorists (many of whom are female and/or nonwhite) is an implicit statement about how the department understands and encourages its students to understand these topics. By including Marx but not including feminists on the syllabus, the department communicates that capitalism is an institution worthy of criticism, but sexism is not. Furthermore, allowing concentrators to read Hegel, Tocqueville and Polanyi, to name a few, without providing sociological criticisms of their work gives credence to their views, many of which are characterized by sexist, racist and imperialist beliefs.
The social studies department’s ideology is one that we cannot accept. An understanding of social issues that does not pass through the lens of gender theory, post-colonialism, or theories of racial oppression is an understanding that is not academically rigorous. The more pressing issue, however, is justice; it is unjust to ignore these perspectives. The classic texts of social theory have shaped our understanding of power and humanity up to the present, and it is clear that this understanding must in many ways change. If we are serious about confronting the most pressing contemporary issues, we must move beyond the traditional canon of social theory and engage in new ways of thinking about inequality and injustice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You would think it would take a miracle for the two opposing attorneys of Bush v. Gore (2000) to find common legal ground on anything. But Perry v. Schwarzenegger, an ongoing trial in California that finished hearing witness testimony late last month, has united Ted Olson, an “icon” of the conservative legal movement, and David Boies, his former “liberal adversary,” on perhaps the only ideology they share. Both lawyers believe that California’s Proposition 8 is unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment, and both are willing to take their case to the U.S. Supreme Court in order to prove it.
News outlets have noted a high probability that Perry v. Schwarzenegger will eventually become a “landmark” civil rights decision on par with Brown v. Board (1954) and Roe v. Wade (1973), consistent with Boies’s and Olson’s ultimate vision. “We acted together,” Boies commented in The Wall Street Journal, to emphasize that this is “not a liberal or conservative issue, but an issue of enforcing our Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection.” Indeed, as Olson echoed in Newsweek, “legalizing same-sex marriage” would “represent the culmination of our nation’s commitment to equal rights.”
The bipartisan duo is exactly right. Based on previous rulings by the Supreme Court, Prop 8 violates the Constitution’s guarantee that a state cannot “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” But even more strikingly, if the Court upholds Prop 8, the ramifications would be much more devastating than a speed bump on the road to civil equality. If they affirm that Prop 8 and the Fourteenth Amendment are not mutually exclusive, they would, effectively, overturn the landmark decision in 1967 that made bans on interracial marriage unconstitutional.
That case, titled Loving v. Virginia (1967), is one of the primary decisions cited by Olson and Boies as precedent. Loving, a white male citizen of Virginia, married a black fellow Virginian out-of-state and was charged, along with his wife, with violation of Virginia’s Racial Integrity Act of 1924. The couple challenged the constitutionality of this law under the Fourteenth Amendment, and on appeal, the Supreme Court of Virginia upheld it because the state has a personal stake in preserving the “racial integrity” of its citizens. In addition, since a man and a woman who violate this law are both punished equally, the law surely grants “equal protection” to both whites and blacks.
In a unanimous decision, the U.S. Supreme Court obliterated their reasoning. Violation of the Equal Protection Clause, wrote Chief Justice Earl Warren, is related to “arbitrary and invidious discrimination,” regardless of the fairness with which punishments are distributed. Since marriage is one of the “basic civil rights of man” that is “essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness,” to deny this “fundamental freedom” to two people who love each other on such an arbitrary criteria as race is “directly subversive of the principle of equality.” All that Olson and Boies need to do to prove their case, therefore, is extend the Loving ruling from racial discrimination to sexual discrimination, a policy that is also forbidden under the equal protection clause.
Now, supporters of Prop 8 will argue that Loving’s guarantee of a “freedom to marry” is completely irrelevant to the question of gay marriage because, quite simply, gay marriage is not actually marriage. As a New York Appellate Court put it in Hernandez v. Robles (2006), “until a few decades ago, it was an accepted truth for almost everyone who ever lived…that there could be marriages only between participants of different sex,” whereas interracial marriage has always been between a man and a woman.
The crucial flaw in this argument, and the reason why Prop 8 is such a threat to Loving, is that the Virginia courts didn’t believe that interracial marriage was “marriage”  either. Marriage is a divine institution, wrote the Virginian judge that originally gave the Lovings their sentence, and God “placed [separate races] on separate continents,” in order to demonstrate that He did “not intend for [them] to mix.” In Naim v. Naim (1955), the Virginia Supreme Court similarly argued that there is a clear “natural law” which renders interracial marriage a “corruption,” since God had clearly rendered different races with “different natures.” The Warren Court, however, rendered all of these concerns baseless, since marriage cannot be defined by the superficial characteristics of those involved. Legitimizing the concerns of those who are against gay marriage will also therefore legitimize the concerns of the segregationists four decades ago.
Unless the court can find a viable reason to distinguish between interracial marriage and gay marriage, they must therefore conclude that Prop 8 is an unconstitutional as the Racial Integrity Act of 1924. If they fail, they will be tossing into the dustbin the reasoning that the Supreme Court used in Loving to strike down laws that banned interracial marriage, thereby implicitly overriding it. Two years ago, we elected a president raised by parents whose marriage was only considered fully valid after a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court. Perhaps one day, after the Court makes the right decision regarding laws like Prop 8, we will elect another.

Travis Roy was 20 years old when he started at his first college game, sporting number 24 in the red and white of Boston University. In October of 1995, they were facing off against the University of North Dakota. After a lifetime of preparation,  Roy was ready to play Division I hockey.
Since the tender age of three, Roy had been pushing himself on the ice. His dream was to play college hockey, followed by a career in the NHL and even the Olympics. These were lofty goals, but Roy remained optimistic about his abilities. He referred to playing hockey as his “sixth sense,” something that came to him as naturally as sight and sound. Despite also excelling at tennis, soccer, and lacrosse, Roy considered hockey his game.
His drive and talent didn’t go unnoticed. A nationally-ranked athlete, Roy had been heavily recruited during his senior year and won a scholarship to join the BU Terriers, the defending NCAA champions. But a mere 11 seconds after the referee dropped the puck onto the ice, Roy’s career as an athlete was over.
Lee J. Roy watched from the sidelines as his son’s body flew headfirst into the sideboards of the rink, thrown off balance after another player dodged his body check.  Lee knew he’d raised a resilient kid who picked himself up after falling down, but he realized that something was seriously wrong when the same boy who always kept playing made no attempt to get up after this fall. Travis tried to move, but after cracking his fourth and fifth cervical vertebra during the collision, he was paralyzed from the neck down.
His father ran down to the ice from the stands to see his son. “I’m in big trouble,” Travis managed to say. “I can’t feel anything and my neck is hurting...but Dad, I made it.”
Fifteen years have passed since the accident at BU. Through physical therapy, Roy has recovered the ability to use his right arm. Yet he hasn’t allowed his disability to impede an active lifestyle. He travels the country as an inspirational speaker, promoting the potential rather than the limitations of life. In 1997, he wrote “Eleven Seconds,” an autobiography that documents his journey from the tragic moment on the ice to his new, very different life as a quadriplegic. That same year, he started a foundation that funds research on treating spinal cord injuries and supports patients who don’t have the money to cover medical costs. Since then, he has supported stem cell technology, a promising cure for not only spinal cord injuries, but a wide array of problems ranging from cancer to heart disease.
JOURNEY TO THE FOREFRONT
This year, Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology (HDRB) attracted just under 50 sophomores for its inaugural class of concentrators. The emergence of this concentration is the latest in a wider effort by the University to bring stem cell research to the forefront. It began six years ago when Professor Douglas A. Melton, while surveying the field of stem cell research, realized that bringing together some of the best minds in the subject would remove many of the barriers to collaboration. Thus, the Harvard Stem Cell Institute (HSCI) was founded. What began as committee meetings in the Holyoke Center evolved into a comprehensive team of scientists, now established at local research insitutions such as Massachusetts General Hospital and Joslin Diabetes Center.
A few years later, Melton helped form the Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology another angle to studying the life sciences. Classes were offered that focused on the growth of human beings and the role that stem cells could play in helping treat diseases and injuries. It was during this time that talk began of a new concentration.
There was interest from the students in SCRB classes as well as the HSCI researchers who were teaching the SCRB classes. Melton and his colleague Kevin C. Eggan, a recent Biology Ph.D. from MIT, started laying the groundwork. After a proposal submission and several rounds of administrative examination, the HDRB concentration was born—the eighth to be added to a growing number of specialized fields in studying biology.
Melton, now a concentration advisor with Eggan, says one crucial principle guided the decisions when crafting a curriculum that was unique to HDRB. “There was an increasing recognition that students are quite interested in the human being, less interested in just studying model organisms,” he says.
FROM PETRI DISHES TO PATIENTS
Early on in the new fall course SCRB 180: “Repair and Regeneration in the Mammalian Brain,” Travis Roy came to the Biolabs to talk about hockey, his accident, and coping with the aftermath. As one of 250,000 Americans living with spinal cord injuries, Roy told the students that he could someday be treated by developments in the same field studied in the course.
Professor Jeffrey D. Macklis, who co-teaches SCRB 180 with Professor Paola Arlotta has been working for the past 15 years on the development and regeneration of neurons and brain circuitry in mice. He has also received significant grant money from the Travis Roy Foundation for his research (the two have become good friends).
His lab studies the molecular controls over the development of different kinds of neurons—cells that comprise the nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord—and figures out how to stimulate the growth of these neurons in the brain with already-present progenitor (“stem”) cells.  In specifically examining motor neurons that connect the brain to the spinal cord, Macklis aims to grow new neurons in damaged or malfunctioning parts of the brain and reactivating the controls and skills those parts once had. But despite their own expertise, Macklis and Arlotta invited Roy as a speaker to demonstrate the human side of stem cell science, while allowing Macklis to derive with the class what cells and circuits are injured and in need of repair.
“Meeting Travis and going through all of his injuries and symptoms basically laid out the whole biology relevant to spinal cord injury and, by analogy, ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a disease that attacks the cells in charge of voluntary muscle movement),” says Macklis. “Since there are so many diseases and kinds of neurons, Paola and I used Travis’ practical motivation as a way to say, ‘Let’s study these systems in detail.’”
SCRB 180 also emphasizes the dynamic methods behind the medicine. The teaching style is partially Socratic, and Macklis and Arlotta step away from traditional lectures to encourage student discussion and interpretation of the science. While there are two textbooks, and weekly readings, they are only meant to provide a foundation for individual inquiry.
“The best education for students is not to teach them individual tidbits to remember. I want to be changing the tidbits every six months,” says Macklis. “If we taught them all the tidbits now, they’d be wrong in three years.”
Students filling out course evaluations for the course wrote that “regurgitating” facts was not sufficient and that it was “a thinking class.”
SCRB 167: “What does Human Disease Teach us about Mammalian Biology?”—a 14-person seminar, takes a similar approach by bringing in patients suffering from the conditions covered in the class; one day featured a leukemia survivor and his wife, who discussed his past treatments, his bone marrow transplant, and his battle with “graft--versus-host” disease, in which transplant cells attack the cells of the host body.
“I think it is good for students to see a live person at the end of this. It’s not just in mice,” says Professor Jerome Ritz, who also spoke that day about his research on graft-versus-host disease at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
“We are using disease and patients to illustrate basic features of stem cell biology. I think that’s a very unusual teaching approach for undergraduates,” says Professor George Q. Daley of his course’s structure. “I think it’s going to be particularly effective in the field of stem cells which has so much medical relevance.”
Along with the classroom engagement and exposure to implications in actual treatment, the concentration adds a unique academic requirement: one semester’s worth of research in a lab.
For the new concentrators, this is a large part of the experience they hope to gain by joining HDRB. “You can lecture about the topic as much as you want. Lecturing is not as strong a way of teaching as actually [being] involved with research,” says Edward Daniel ’12.
S. Alison Kraemer ’12 agrees. “You can have as much didactic learning as you want, and you don’t really understand what you’re learning until you apply it,” she says.
Willam J. Anderson, the undergraduate curriculum development manager for HDRB, stresses the benefits of such an “active approach.”
“By being able to do hands-on research...it really allows [students] to obtain ownership over the experiments that they do,” says Anderson. “To look at something that no one else has looked at before, so they’re adding to the process that may be in the future be taught in the classroom.” That kind of change is to be expected in a fast-paced field. According to Melton, any new methods of experimentation could be incorporated in a course within a year or two.
THE “CRÈME DE LA CRÈME”
Although the concentration can only currently boast a group of 15 professors, they are, as Anderson says, “the crème de la crème.”
Professor Amy J. Wagers, for example, announced in late January a discovery she and her lab had made which showed that when exposed to proteins that were usually found in the blood of young mice, the blood of old mice became younger as well. In other words, her research was able to reverse ageing in the cells of old mice, and it suggests that the diseases that occur as a result of old age could be combated with developments in stem cells.
Her colleague Kenneth R. Chien ’73 has devoted his time to examining one of the body’s most important muscles: the heart. Last fall, in a collaboration with K. Kit Parker of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, his lab made headlines when it produced a strip of fully-functioning heart muscle from mouse stem cells. The muscle acts just as a normal heart would; it beats, contracts, and it even responds to a pacemaker. The next focus for Chien is in creating a “heart patch,” which could treat people with heart disease by replacing damaged tissue with healthy cells—somewhat like a bandage over a scraped knee, if that bandage were to actually become part of the knee.  Although Chien believes they will have a film of human heart muscle finished by the end of this year, he acknowledges that the process to creating a “patch” is not one that can be rushed.
“It is the beginning,” he says. “Everything starts with a Model T before it can become a Porsche. This is sort of like Orville Wright; if you can get the plane off the ground for about six feet, that’s better than nothing, and from then you work on that and make the next version.”
Inevitably, this research often diffuses into the professors’ teaching. Wagers taught SCRB 190: “Understanding Aging: Degeneration, Regeneration, and the Scientific Search for the Fountain of Youth” in the fall semester while also doing groundbreaking work on an actual “fountain of youth.”
The intersection between lab and classroom even applies to SCRB 10, the department’s introductory course. “We were learning from people who really were out there empirically gathering data,” says Samuel H. Marrs ’12,  an HDRB concentrator. “They were actually doing the work and showing us, or showing us colleague’s work—all contemporary, all 2000 and above. Sometimes we’d even look at things that were 2009, a couple months prior.”
Despite its success so far—the benchmark Q rating for SCRB courses is 4.4, significantly than higher than the 3.9 held by the natural sciences division—HDRB nevertheless struggles as a new and relatively small concentration. Kraemer expressed concern about getting into a lab class for the spring semester, which only had a limited number of spots; other students via Q Guide have mentioned that the courses are enlightening, but unstructured.
While many of the classes are still being fine-tuned after their first runs, the HDRB faculty have pushed to establish strong connections with their concentrators. “They really want to hit the ground running. I like this a lot because they really try to make sure we are taken care of,” says Daniel.
Janelle S. Lambert ‘12 echoes these sentiments: “They are always aiming to get opinions and advice about what they want in the concentration,” she says. “It’s also kind of small right now. I get to know basically everyone.”
To further improve intra-concentration bonding, there have been lunches with professors and talk of a possible trivia night or “Gattaca” screening, followed by a discussion of the plausibility of the technology portrayed in the film. Anderson says that HDRB is trying to become a community.
It is partly due to the efforts of a professor seeking to establish strong connections with his students that convinced Lambert to commit to HDRB. After taking the Freshman Seminar “Blood: From Gory to Glory” with Professor David T. Scadden, co-director of HSCI, she was impressed by the lab work that Scadden showed her class. On one occasion, they were able to watch as a mouse —irradiated to the brink of death was injected with stem cells—two weeks later, they returned to find the same mouse, up and running.
In the end, professors hope to have HDRB concentrators proficient in multiple scientific disciplines and aware of the practical applications of those disciplines. “I believe that graduates in this degree will be better prepared for almost any aspect of the life sciences as it relates to business, technology, medicine, science, engineering, politics, sociology, than perhaps any other scientific discipline,” says Chien. “It encompasses a lot of the features of the complexity of modern science in a modern world.”
A CLEAR LENS
Those studying HDRB have their own aspirations to become doctors, surgeons, researchers, and industry professionals, but Alison Kraemer has a uniquely personal attachment to the work.
At the age of 13, Kraemer was an avid dancer, practicing at a dress rehearsal for an upcoming performance. During a transition in one of her pieces, another larger girl accidentally knocked her down. She suffered from spinal injuries and pain from that fall, and they’ve kept her from dancing ever since. “There’s basically nothing out there that can cure me,” says Kraemer.
After the accident, she devoted herself to other interests such as playing the flute and Model U.N. While on a committee for Model U.N. during her freshman year of high school, she first encountered the idea of stem cells after being assigned the topic of human cloning as a delegate. In later reading Christopher Reeves’ autobiography, she became even more interested in the subject and found the outlet to pursue it when she came to Harvard.
Kraemer worked in Paola Arlotta’s lab on the differentiation of stem cells in the motor neurons of the spine this past summer, and she discovered her passion for a field that would actually matter for her. One day she would like to be able to help people with stem cell technology as a spinal orthopedic surgeon.
“I really want to be an instigator, or at least a participator in research,” she says, “Basically because of my injury, I learned a lot about orthopedics and spinal neurology. I don’t want anyone to suffer like I have or worse.”
Many scientists caution against moving the process too quickly. “This is not going to be easy, and we have to make it very clear that each one of these advances in stem cell biology gets us closer,” says Chien. “We have to distinguish between getting a first down, getting across the 50-yard line, and a Hail Mary pass. These are important steps, but might not necessarily be the touchdown that we’ve been waiting for.”
Kraemer, Roy, and the others out there who stand to regain vital aspects of their lives when these treatments become possible, hope that time will come as soon as it can. These people are the lens that learning in the HDRB concentration is being seen through. While the future advances in the stem cell field may be blurry, the lens itself is clear.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students who stayed on campus during January Term without University approval may face disciplinary measures, though the severity of the repercussions remains unclear, according to Jay L. Ellison, associate dean of the College and secretary of the Administrative Board—the College’s primary disciplinary body.
Some undergraduates frequented campus facilities without permission—either as local residents or as campus-squatters—but none of their cases have landed on his desk yet, Ellison said.
“The report I’ve received is there are some coming,” Ellison said in an interview Monday.
Ellison said he did not know what punishment the students faced or whether they would appear before the Ad Board, but he acknowledged that the individuals had violated school rules prohibiting unauthorized students from using University facilities, including dorms and dining halls.
“That is a violation of rules, so the Ad Board is interested in a violation of the rules,” Ellison said. “There would be a response—I’m not exactly sure what the response would be.”
Ellison said he was particularly concerned by reports of unauthorized students lying to campus officials about their status.
Administrators monitored card swipes in Annenberg Dining Hall and flagged some suspicious activity, such as cards that had been swiped multiple times for a meal—possibly indicating that some had been swiping unauthorized students into the dining hall.
The administration approved over 93 percent of more than 1,400 applicants for room and board on campus during the College’s inaugural J-Term. But that left thousands of undergraduates—facing the longest winter break in recent history—without permission to stay in the Houses.
One undergraduate student—who asked to remain anonymous to preserve relations with the administration—reported remaining on campus for two weeks without authorization, holed up for most of the time in a dorm room with a rice cooker and instant noodles. The student, who had missed the application deadline for authorization, did not have swipe access to the House, but was never identified by administrators for the infraction.
The individual reported being cautious when encountering resident tutors.
“They were a little bit suspicious. I just said something about working really hard,” the student said. “I was a bit paranoid, but it was okay.”
Laure E. de Vulpillieres, a resident tutor in Kirkland House, said she was unaware of unauthorized students on campus, though she was told to report such students to the resident dean.
Vulpillieres wondered why unauthorized students would stay on campus, given that they would have no access to Annenberg and need to depend on others for House access.
“It seems like it would be distinctly un-fun to be here,” she said.
Adams House Master John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 said that he thought J-Term went smoothly, despite the presence of squatters on campus.
“I’m sure there were people here that were not supposed to be here. There was not the disorder that we were worried about,” Palfrey said. “I think the very, very large majority of people that were here were here doing what they promised the University they would do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School announced yesterday that it would create a $1 million fund to provide “seed money” for students entering careers in public service, replacing the third-year tuition waiver program suspended early last year.
The Public Service Venture Fund will award students with one-year grants ranging from a few thousand dollars to as much as $80,000 to supplement salaries in the public sector or to start non-profit organizations. Alexa Shabecoff, the Law School’s assistant dean for public service, said that the amounts awarded may vary depending on student interest and need.
The new program replaces the Public Service Initiative piloted in 2008, a groundbreaking program that exempted students who committed to public service work for five years after graduation from paying their third-year tuition.
Students entering the Law School this fall will be the first class eligible to receive money from the new program upon graduating.
The new grant system ensures better budgeting predictability but will be slightly more expensive than the tuition waiver program suspended early last year, Shabecoff said. The cost of the former program fluctuated depending on student interest, as there were no limits on enrollment. And given the difficult economic climate, the Law School needed to control its budget more vigilantly.
The new program will also offer more flexibility to students looking to enter the public service sector. Though funding is only intended to last one year, Shabecoff said, students will be eligible for continued support if necessary and will not be required to remain in the public sector for a specified period of time.
But Law School professor David B. Wilkins emphasized that this program was not meant as an endless source of funding for student projects.
“We’re not a real venture fund. And even a real venture fund does not give any sustained support,” said Wilkins, who was consulted during the creation of the fund.
According to Wilkins, shifts in both student interest and in the legal profession toward entrepreneurship prompted administrators to focus on funding social ventures when developing this latest program.
Traditional career paths after law school are evolving dramatically, Wilkins said—a phenomenon that mirrors changes in the ways people are now tackling pressing social problems.
“I’ve talked to students all the time who are searching for a new way of approaching legal practice that can provide important and sustained contributions to the public,” he said. “Our students see a huge gap in our legal system.”
But those who wish to start social enterprises can face huge obstacles, with funding difficult to come by and institutional support for public ventures often lacking.
While private sector firms can rely on consultants and venture capitalists to raise money for start-ups, social enterprises largely lack a similar infrastructure, said Alan A. Khazei ’83, a Law School graduate who is advising the fund.
“The hardest money to raise is the first grant,” Khazei said.
Because the Law School has never offered seed grants before, Shabecoff said she plans to gather expertise from foundations that offer similar services as well as convene a committee of faculty and public and private sector professionals.
“We are certainly breaking new ground,” Shabecoff said. “Yes, it’s a challenge, but we have a pretty good brain trust.”
The application process will involve more work on the students’ part, Shabecoff said. For instance, students requesting larger grants may be asked to submit letters of recommendation or detailed business plans for their venture.
But the “more onerous” process may deter students from applying to the new program, said Brian T. Aune, president of the Law School’s student government.
Khazei, who founded the urban public service program City Year, said that he expects similar programs to emerge across the country, as other institutions build on Harvard’s model.
“Five years from now, we’ll see this program replicated at schools across the country,” Khazei said.

Researchers find that married couples living in a war zone are more likely to experience domestic violence.
The team—led by Cari Clark, a former doctoral student at the Harvard School of Public Health now at the University of Minnesota Medical School—found that husbands exposed to political violence are nearly twice as likely to be physically violent and more than twice as likely to be sexually violent toward their wives.
The researchers analyzed domestic violence statistics from 4,000 couples surveyed in the Gaza Strip between Dec. 2005 and Jan. 2006.
According to the study, the widespread poverty, political instability in the region at the time led to feelings of humiliation and frustration among Palestinian men.
Clark and her researchers speculate that the effects of political violence—which include injury, post-traumatic syndrome, constraints on mobility, and economic strain—prompt men to violently reassert their position of power in the only situation that remains under their control: the domestic sphere.
While gender inequality and traditional gender roles often lead to domestic violence, “exposure to political violence exacerbates [those] factors,” Clark said. “Political violence adds an additional stressor on the household.”

World-renowned soprano Renée Fleming challenged student singers to push their limits in a master class yesterday as part of Harvard’s Learning From Performers program, offering feedback for four performers and leading the audience through a number of breathing exercises.
Fleming, a three-time Grammy Award winner who specializes in opera and lieder, provided constructive criticism to the singers after each of their individual performances in the master class, which was organized by the Office for the Arts.
The American artist challenged the four student performers—Bridget Haile ’11, Michael D. Cherella ’11, Francesca R. L. Reindel ’11, and Sofia M. Selowsky ’12—to “get out of the comfort zone” and to “impale” audience members with their singing.
Fleming said she sought to use the master class to “feed little bits of information about what I hear needs to be worked on.”
“I thought [Fleming] was wonderful at being casual, and I kind of forgot about everyone else in the audience,” said Haile, the first to perform out of the four singers. “I was very lucky to get the opportunity to be able to come out and do this.”
Fleming is in the Cambridge area this week for three performances with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, beginning Feb. 11.
Past visiting artists in the Learning From Performers program include Baroque violinist Elizabeth Blumenstock and Grammy Award winner and actor Blair Underwood.
According to Learning From Performers Program Manager Thomas Lee, the selection of visiting artists is not “an exact science,” and depends largely upon the availability of a particular artist.
“It’s a blend of opportunities that might come up—like Ms. Fleming, which we didn’t even know about until about two weeks ago,” Lee said.
Learning From Performers—established soon after the founding of the OFA in 1975—facilitates collaboration between Harvard students and artists of various disciplines, including music, dance, theatre, and the visual arts.
The program is working towards establishing more long-term projects that involve greater interaction between visiting artists and academic departments at Harvard, according to Lee.
“Many more faculty members now approach us about bringing artists in,” Lee said. “We are always seeking out partners and collaborators—it’s a mutual goal.”

Six years after Princeton capped the number of A’s its professors doled out, discussion over grade inflation has reemerged on Ivy League campuses.
Students at Princeton recently expressed discontent with their school’s grade inflation policy, which limits the number of A’s awarded in each department to 35 percent.
A Dec. 2 editorial in The Daily Princetonian denounced the grading system, stating that “the policy itself has too many harmful consequences that outweigh the good intentions behind the system.”
While Harvard students do not face the same grade caps as their Princeton counterparts, most share their conviction that grade limits do more harm than good.
“It wouldn’t be fair if more than half of the class deserved A’s, but couldn’t get them,” said Lawrence Chan ’13.
Atasha A. Jordan ’13 said she did not think students would be motivated to work as hard if they knew the chances of receiving an A were slim.
While the Princeton faculty passed the grade cap in 2004 by a 2 to 1 margin, Harvard faculty members remain divided on what to do about the issue.
History professor Steven E. Ozment said he gives out grades based on participation and student understanding of the material.
“When someone is excited, it is hard to say they shouldn’t get an A,” Ozment said. He estimates that about 80 percent of his students have earned A’s over the past four or five years, all of which were “fully deserved.”
In contrast, noted grade inflation opponent and government professor Harvey C.—or according to some students, “C-minus”—Mansfield ’53 said that Princeton’s grading cap may not be strict enough.
Grading inflation has continued because “parents like it, students like it, the faculty likes it, and the administration loves it,” Mansfield said.
To demonstrate his continuing opposition to grade inflation, Mansfield has a policy of giving two grades: the “private” grade he believes the student deserves and the “public” grade that goes on the student’s transcript.
“I wanted to still be against grade inflation but not punish my own students for taking the course,” Mansfield said.
Lawrence Buell, who served as the Dean of Undergraduate Education from 1992 to 1996, wrote in an e-mail that grade inflation has long been a topic of discussion at Harvard, but “there simply wasn’t enough faculty consensus around whether the drift toward higher average grades was inherently irresponsible, and even if so, what to do about it.”
However, the faculty did limit the percentage of students who receive Latin honors on their diploma after 91 percent of the Class of 2001 graduated with honors.

A new study finds that religion may have evolved as a by-product of non-religious, cognitive processes, dispelling a competing theory that religion served as an adaptation to help unrelated individuals cooperate.
The findings, published Monday in the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences, suggests that people’s gut instinct for what is right and wrong operates independently of religious upbringing.
Harvard psychology professor Marc D. Hauser, who co-authored the study, argues that from an evolutionary perspective, cognitive mechanisms involved in moral decision-making precede organized religion.
“Morality is far more ancient than religion,” Hauser said. “Most, if not all, of the psychological ingredients that enter into religion originally evolved to solve more general problems of social interaction.”
Hauser claimed the findings help explain recent studies indicating that people’s moral intuitions vary little across different religions.
To illustrate the universality of certain moral intuitions, Hauser presented two hypothetical options for saving a group of seven people in a closed room—pressing a button to divert poisonous gas from the room or pushing a person into a ventilation shaft to stop the gas from reaching the room.
“Far fewer people would say [the latter] is permissible, regardless of religious background,” Hauser said.
In cases of moral judgment that fall outside the norm—martyrdom, for instance—Hauser and co-author Ilkka Pyysiäinen of the Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies propose that religion, much like legal institutions, exerts its own pressure on people’s moral judgments after it emerged from natural cognitive processes.
Though Hauser said he anticipates negative reaction to his apparent down-playing of religion’s significance, the study’s purpose was not to cheapen religion.
“To those who find meaning in religious experience, I have nothing either positive or negative to say,” he said.
Hauser and Pyysiäinen add that their findings are not meant to explain religion, but to deny the claim that “all aspects of religion emerged at once at some point in history.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Noni D. Carter ’13 was 12 years old when a family gathering inspired her to embark on a project that would transform her from a child with a dream to a young woman who urges others to follow theirs.
That evening six years ago, Carter’s great-aunt visited her home in Fayetteville, Ga.
“She gathered me and my sister and my cousins around, and she told the story of my great-great-great-grandmother Rose,” Carter recalls. When Rose was 12 years old, her mother was sold to a different slave owner. The young girl never reunited with her mother.
Upon hearing this painful story from her family’s past, Carter said she ran to her room with tears streaming down her face.
“I have to be able to inspire other people the way her story touched me,” Carter remembers telling herself.
That was the birth of “Good Fortune,” Carter’s first novel, which­—after six years of writing, editing, and some good fortune of her own—was published this January.
A WORK IN PROGRESS
Carter says that she has enjoyed writing for as long as she can remember, and that her family imbued her with a love of history from an early age.
When she began her novel at age 12, Carter says she read slave narratives and made frequent trips to the library to learn about African-American life in the early 1800s.
“I read so much that I was in that time period when I wrote,” she says. “I would lock my door and be in that time.”
At age 15, she completed the first draft of her book, which had grown from a 25-page short story to a 300-page manuscript.
Inspired by her own family history, Carter decided to write about a girl who is kidnapped from her African home and enslaved in Tennessee, where she secretly learns to read despite her plantation’s rules.
The novel chronicles her struggles in slavery and her quest for freedom.
Upon reading his daughter’s work, Carter’s father, Clinton A. Carter ’83, was the first to suggest that she attempt to publish the novel.
Excited by the idea, Carter began to revise her story for publication. “Editing was a lot tougher than the actual writing,” she says.
By May 2008, she felt that the book was ready. Acting on the advice of poet and publisher Kwame Alexander—whom Carter met at a musical retreat—the aspiring author and her father traveled to Los Angeles to attend BookExpo America, the largest annual book trade fair in the United States.
Carter spent two days at the convention center talking to publishers about her book.
“Nobody gets picked up off the floor, but we didn’t know that at the time,” she says. “At the end of the second day, we were really discouraged and ready to go home.”
But Carter decided to try one more publisher.
Without looking at the name of the company, she strode up to the booth.
The person behind the booth, who turned out to be a vice president at Simon & Schuster, “just engulfed Noni with energy” and asked her to return the next day, according to Carter’s father.
“He just stopped in the middle of the discussion and said, ‘Let’s cut to the chase, we want to sign Noni,’” he recalls. “I was trying to be a businessman about this whole situation. Internally, I was exploding, jumping for joy.”
Over the next year and a half, Carter worked with Simon & Schuster to further hone her manuscript and started her freshman year at Harvard in the meantime.
On Jan. 5, her book was released.
“Twelve years old to 18—that’s a key point in your life; you grow so much,” she muses. “There’s definitely my own growth story somewhere in there.”
EARNEST ABOUT EDUCATION
Since the release of her book, Carter has visited schools, bookstores, libraries, and churches to read excerpts from “Good Fortune” and speak to young people about her writing journey.
“That’s where my passion lies, book published or not,” she says of the opportunity to talk to students.
“My whole goal is to inspire young people in my generation to be the best they can be, to go for their goals and dreams like the main character in my book.”
This past Monday, while speaking to fourth, fifth, and sixth graders at Benjamin Banneker Charter Public School in Cambridge, Carter relates the importance of “the three E’s: emancipation, education, and earnestness.”
As she asks the students about their own conceptions of these three values and their knowledge of African-American history, her cheerful refrain of “very good, very good” in response to each child’s contribution reveals her enthusiasm for teaching.
“We would go upstairs, and her sister and the dolls would all be around her, and Noni would have her papers out teaching class,” Carter’s father remembers.
Her mother, Denise M. Bell-Carter, affirms her daughter’s desire to use her book as a platform to promote education.
“She’s following her passion, which is to really educate, motivate, and inspire youth,” Carter’s mother says. “She just lights up when she’s able to do that.”
Around the time she began writing “Good Fortune,” Carter sent a letter to one of her favorite authors, African-American science fiction writer Tananarive Due.
Due responded and has kept in touch with Carter ever since, even penning a laudatory quote for the back of Carter’s novel.
“That’s what I hope to be,” Carter says. “That kind of author who’s always in touch with her fans.”
At the end of her speech at Banneker, Carter mentions that February is Black History Month.
She urges her young listeners to look up a figure from African-American history whom they have never heard of before—and to e-mail her with their findings.
THE NEXT CHAPTER
Over lunch in Annenberg, Carter talks about her involvement in student activities and her Expos class, insisting, “I’m a normal freshman.”
“Noni is inspirational, wonderful, and talented, but most importantly she has her head on her shoulders,” says her friend Rachel V. Byrd ’13.
Benjamin J. Likis ’13, who lives in Carter’s entryway in Canaday, says that Carter is extremely modest about her accomplishments.
“I think other people were more excited for the release of her book than she was,” Likis says.
“She’s not really about that. For her, it’s just about getting the story out there and making sure that people understand the importance of getting an education.”
Just weeks after publishing her first novel, Carter is already contemplating her next literary endeavor.
For the subject of her second book, she says she is “hoping that the widely available resources here at Harvard will allow me to delve into another culture, hopefully in Latin America or the Caribbean.”
After Carter reads a haunting passage from “Good Fortune” about her young protagonist’s theft from Africa by slave traders, the children at Banneker eagerly pepper her with questions.
“Would you consider yourself famous?” one student asks.
“Nah,” Carter replies. A twinkle enters her eye. “I don’t know. Maybe. We’ll see.”

Anthropology Professor Richard W. Wrangham and Elizabeth A. Ross will effectively cede their role as Currier House Masters during the next school year as they take a sabbatical abroad, according to an e-mail sent to the Currier House community by Ross about an hour ago.
Harvard Law School Professor James L. Cavallaro '84 and Nadejda Marques, a research coordinator at the Harvard School of Public Health, will take their place while Wrangham and Ross are in Europe, Africa, and Japan next year.
"In the last 18 months we have quickly come to regard Currier as our home," Ross wrote in the e-mail. "The extraordinary good will and wonderful sense of welcome that you have extended ever since our arrival makes us totally appreciate this warm-hearted house."
Wrangham and Ross began their tenure as House Masters in 2008.

Sometimes all it takes is one. Ask Liza Ryabkina.
The junior forward on the No.5 Harvard women’s hockey team, who scored four times in a 5-0 win against Boston College last week in the opening round of the 32nd annual Beanpot Tournament, once again spearheaded the Crimson’s offensive efforts last night against No. 9 Northeastern in the championship game. This time, Ryabkina’s output was more modest—just a single goal—but it was enough to give Harvard (16-5-4, 11-5-2 ECAC) a 1-0 win over the Huskies (16-7-5, 8-5-4 Hockey East) and the Crimson’s 14th Beanpot title in front of a lively home crowd at Bright Hockey Center.
“We’re really happy to have brought the Beanpot back to Cambridge and Harvard,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “It was an excellent hockey game—back and forth...Those are the types of games championships should be like.”
Harvard got on the board just over half a minute into the second period, when Ryabkina fished the puck out of a scrum in front of the net. The junior, positioned near the left post, backhanded a shot from a tricky angle that managed to sneak through Northeastern goalie Leah Sulyma’s legs.
“I practice a lot shooting from that corner,” Ryabkina said, “so I sort of knew where the openings were. It just worked out well.”
Ryabkina’s performance throughout the Beanpot made her the unanimous choice for the tournament’s Most Valuable Player award, and marked the highlight in a season which started two months late for the Khariv, Ukraine native thanks to a dislocated knee. Since her return, Ryabkina has been dangerous with the puck, scoring 11 goals and netting six assists in just 16 games and providing a major boost to the Crimson offense.
“[Ryabkina] has some pretty special hockey gifts,” Stone said. “She shoots as well as any of the top-five people in the world, and I’ve seen some of them in this rink and [in a] Harvard jersey before. Her release is that quick.”
While Ryabkina’s goal gave the Crimson a 1-0 advantage, it was freshman goalie Laura Bellamy and the Harvard defense who made sure it stayed that way.
In the first two periods, Bellamy was mostly able to sit back and watch her teammates dominate the play on the other end of the ice. The Crimson was relentless on the attack, outshooting the Huskies, 12-5, in the first frame before exploding for 26 shots in the second.
“I think we just didn’t adjust real well in the second period,” said Northeastern interim co-head coach and former Harvard player Lauren McAuliffe ’04. “It seemed like we didn’t really show up that period...The momentum never shifted. They just sealed us in the zone a few times and I think that took our confidence away to a certain extent.”
But despite its inflated shot total, the Crimson was unable to push its lead past one, thanks in large part to an outstanding performance by Northeastern goalie Leah Sulyma, who made 43 saves on the night.
Sensing opportunity to pull off an upset in the third period, the Huskies came out of the locker room with renewed vigor and caught the Crimson off guard. Harvard responded with a series of sloppy penalties, ceding momentum and manpower to Northeastern.
The Huskies fired 16 shots in the frame, but were unable to solve Bellamy and the Crimson penalty kill.
“Just like any team that’s coming from behind in a championship game, they’re going to take some risks,” Stone said of Northeastern. “They’re going to get a little desperate. So we need to be able to manage that kind of pressure and I thought we did a good job of it.”
While the Huskies’ Sulyma was stellar in net, Bellamy was perfect, sealing her shutout by rebuffing a swarm of Northeastern skaters after the Huskies pulled Sulyma in the final minute. After the game, Bellamy was awarded the Joe Bertagna Award for the Beanpot’s top goalie.
“She’s just doing what we expect every goaltender to do,” Stone said. “Make the saves she needs to make and keep us in game when we’re a little bit slow-starting...That’s what she’s doing and it’s been very effective for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Growing up in Boston, I must confess I wasn’t much of a hockey fan. A Red Sox girl through and through, I never paid much attention to my hometown sports in those months between the last out in the fall and the first pitch of spring training. But as a good Bostonian, there was one college hockey tournament that was always on my radar.
The Beanpot has been around much longer than I have—the 58th edition of the men’s tournament wrapped up with a Boston College win on Monday, and Harvard claimed the 32nd women’s title at Bright Hockey Center last night—and for years, it’s been a highlight of the Boston winter sporting schedule. It helps, of course, that Beantown is the biggest hockey hotbed outside of the Midwest.
“People in Minnesota, unless they play out east, probably don’t even know what the Beanpot is, [which is unfortunate], because it’s the oldest hockey tournament for women in the country,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “Ask any player or anyone associated with the four teams in Boston—it’s important.”
But in recent years, the men’s tournament has drawn criticism for being a two-team show. BC and BU have taken every crown since Harvard last won it in 1993. Attendance at TD Garden has dropped, with schools scrambling to sell tickets to this week’s championship game.
When I was offered the chance to cover the men’s second round game on Monday, I jumped at the chance—partially for the chance to live out a Boston sports dream and cover a game at the Garden, but mostly because I had never gotten to experience a men’s Beanpot for myself.
The Garden press box did not disappoint. Despite the frustration of getting lost in the elevators for the first seven minutes of the game, the flat-screen TVs and media restaurant made the experience one of the coolest of my journalistic career. But the experience of the Beanpot?
Granted, I wasn’t covering a championship game, but as it turns out, watching the Crimson lose in front of a sea of empty seats is really not all that exciting.
Fast forward to last night, when I took my usual spot in the Bright press box to watch the Harvard hockey team I’m far more familiar with—the fifth-ranked women—take its shot at a Beanpot title.
I’ve been to women’s Beanpots before. In fact, now in my third year on the women’s hockey beat, this was the third championship game I’ve attended. And like the previous two, this one did not disappoint.
The championship was everything you would want in a hockey game. Each team took its turn in the spotlight, and each goaltender played her heart out. Energy levels were high for three full periods, and the frantic final minutes were the hallmark of a game that both teams truly cared about—a game that meant something.
While on the men’s side, the predictability of the tournament has made it almost a nuisance in the schedule just as the conference playoff chases are heating up. The women clearly value their chance in the spotlight.
“I wish more and more people would be exposed to it, because the level of hockey’s so good,” Stone said. “The competition, the intensity—it’s awesome.”
Though it is the second title for the Crimson in three years, what’s remarkable about the women’s tournament is its parity. Harvard played in the championship game in each of the last three years—but against a different opponent in every iteration. Each team has won at least one title, and though Boston University only has one championship to its name, it’s only been a varsity program since the 2005-06 season.
And in Boston, the level of play for women’s hockey is getting better and better. In each of the last two seasons, the Beanpot championship has also been a matchup of a pair of nationally-ranked squads. So while the Crimson was playing for a title last night, it was also playing to pad its resume for NCAA selection time.
All of these factors add up to make the Beanpot a remarkable tournament for women’s hockey. It’s an atmosphere that’s matched only in the late rounds of the playoffs—and one that has produced some of the most remarkable games in recent history.
The last two championships were each won by the same 1-0 score. Three years ago, the Harvard-Boston College first-round game became an epic triple-overtime battle, seeing Eagles goaltender Molly Schaus set the NCAA single-game saves record before her then-teammate—and current Crimson senior—Anna McDonald netted the game-winner.
Even this year, the Northeastern-Boston University matchup last week saw a thrilling Terrier comeback stopped short by  the Huskies’ goalie Leah Sulyma in a shootout.
Why the near-guarantee of an exciting game? Well, simply put, because it’s important.
“We might not have the 18,000 people, but we’ve got the hearts that are just as big as anyone else’s,” Stone said. “These kids are working their tails off to get the exact same thing [as the men], the exact same kind of recognition.”
I hope that someday I’ll get a chance to get the men’s Beanpot experience I’ve imagined since I was a kid—the chance to watch my team skate in front of a packed Garden crowd in a thrilling, well-played contest.
But in the meantime, I’m more than content to sit in mostly-filled campus arenas and watch a group of talented women play for a title they care about.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some say that it is a long journey to the top. But it has come quickly for talented freshman squash player, Laura Gemmell.
Undefeated thus far, No.1 Gemmell met her match this past Saturday against Penn’s Kristin Lange, the reigning Ivy League Player of the Year. For Gemmell, it was like any other game.
“Even though she knows her opponent was ranked number one in squash, her attitude is as if she’s like anybody else,” Harvard coach Satinder Bajwa said. “Laura comes in, has a very good work ethic, and doesn’t take anything for granted.”
Gemmell soundly defeated Lange in three games, 11-3, 11-9, 11-7, reinforcing her reputation as the top player in the country and placing herself in a good position to claim Lange’s title at the end of the season.
Although she was aware it would be a difficult match, Gemmell was never intimidated.
“Being a freshman and playing against upperclassmen who have been playing at the college level for awhile, I don’t put pressure on myself. I just try to play my game and be as good as I can be,” she said.
However, her personal best has always surpassed expectations, causing her to be virtually unstoppable this season.
“Even when great players are not playing their best, they will win day in and day out against their toughest opponents. Laura is one of those types of players,” Bajwa said.
These complimentary words are supported by her remarkable work on the court throughout the campaign, in which she has demonstrated precocious talent, an unwavering work ethic, and a developed confidence in her own abilities.
The freshman has adjusted to playing at the collegiate level at a remarkable speed, proven by the fact that she has not dropped a single game to anyone, exhibiting her ever-growing confidence.
Only one week shy of maintaining a perfect record in the Ivy League, Gemmell has demonstrated to be a resounding competitor in her first year with the Crimson squad.
For her teammates, Gemmell is more than just a rookie. “She projects to everyone how a good work ethic and going through the basic training you need to do to maintain your level is so important to be a top player,” Coach Bajwa said. “She is so far ahead, yet she works as hard as anybody on the team to stay ahead.”
Gemmell, however, sees her improvement and hard work from an unselfish perspective.
“When you are on the court, you are not just playing for yourself; you are playing for the whole team,” Gemmell said.
This attitude has helped her lead Harvard to the top of the Ivy League, and she has been vocal about her support for her teammates and the assistance they have given her on the court.
Rounding out the weekend with a match against Princeton on Sunday, Gemmell defeated her opponent in a similarly decisive fashion, aiding the Crimson in achieving an emotional win over the Tigers.
Last year, Harvard lost in the finals of the national championship to Princeton, so the victory served as a sort of retribution for the Crimson.
In its matchup against Yale this weekend, Harvard will fight for sole possession of the Ivy League title, with the national team and individual championships taking place in subsequent weekends.
Gemmell expressed her high hopes for success in the Crimson’s quest for a sweep of the titles. “We have nationals coming up where we hope to win that as a team. And then I have the individual tournament, and it is one of my main goals to win that as well.”
Considering the strength of Harvard’s roster, and with Gemmell in the lead, it is within the Crimson’s ability to win the national championships this year and for years to come.
With her amazing work ethic and resounding victories, Gemmell has risen to claim the top spot in the nation during her first year at Harvard. This is a position the squash prodigy will not be giving up any time soon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following an up-and-down weekend at home—first losing to Princeton and then beating Penn—men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker sat down with The Back Page to discuss next weekend’s upcoming games (at Yale Friday, at Brown Saturday). The following are some tidbits from the interview.
Injuries to sophomore Keith Wright and senior Pat Magnarelli, and sophomore Andrew Van Nest’s pneumonia:
“We aren’t, as of today, at full strength. I don’t know when and how that can change. Those guys are out indefinitely, so there’s no time table that we’re dealing with. We’ll get some information today that will give us more direction on that.”
Taking on Yale and Brown with a depleted front line:
“With both of those two teams, their front courts, in my opinion, are their strengths, and so that’s not a good formula for us going into that, and being on the road… but we’ll summon up something to give ourselves the best opportunity possible. Trying to keep guys out of foul trouble will be important…And we have to shoot well. There’s no secret to our attack right now—we have to be able to play well from the perimeter spots, and a lot of times that means making shots. The focal point for us always will be can we defend and keep those guys off the glass from a defensive standpoint in terms of blocking out.”
On Brown star forward Matt Mullery:
“Mullery, in particular, is one of the better players in our league, and we’ve had trouble with him when we’ve had our complete lineup. We’re very much concerned with how we’re going to deal with him. He’s a confident player, and they get the ball to him—they run a lot of high-low things where they get to the top of the circle and try to dump it down to him. It’s going to be tough. We’ll play a little more zone, mix things up, change it up, probably all of the above. Trying to keep him in check a little bit will be a huge challenge for us.”
On sophomore Max Kenyi and freshman Brandyn Curry’s inclusion in the starting lineup:
“We went to Max after our Princeton loss; we went to Max vs. Penn, and Brandyn because we wanted better defense on the floor to start the game…We needed to make a statement that our defensive effort was going to be what we were going to rely on, and what I was going to reward. Those two kids were inserted in the lineup for that, and I think they responded incredibly well.”

Why does it feel like the colder it gets at Harvard, the more House dining halls close their giant wooden doors on poor hungry non-residents? Winthrop has just joined the ranks of Adams, Eliot, Kirkland, Leverett, Lowell, and Quincy by instituting dining hall restrictions. Life for quadlings and other wanderers has just gotten a little bit worse.
According to an e-mail sent yesterday by Winthrop House Administrator Joanna G. Miller, Winthropians have recently found themselves squeezed out of their own dining halls by outsiders scrambling for table space. The Masters and House Committee concluded that some inter-house dining restrictions were in order. They are not terribly different from the types of changes Lowell recently implemented:
One guest per Winthropian for the entire lunch period, every day
One guest per Winthropian for Sunday brunch
One guest per Winthropian for dinner 7 nights a week, until 7:00pm, and then it's open to everyone
Winthrop residents said they had definitely noticed the crunch at dinnertime.
“In general, I don’t really like dining hall restrictions, but there’s definitely been way too many people sitting in our dining hall,” Winthrop resident Christopher R. Behrer ’11 said. “My friend and I had to walk around for 15 minutes yesterday to find a seat.”
But how, you ask, will the dining hall staff know you’re not a Winthrop imposter? It’s ingenious, really. The House tutors will implant a computer chip in each student that will be scanned by laser beams when you enter the dining hall...oh wait, that plan was scrapped.  They’re giving students stickers to put on their IDs.
Don’t know where you can eat anymore? One rule of thumb is that the farther the House from the Yard, the better your odds of finding a place to eat. Dunster, Mather, and the Quad Houses will still welcome you with open arms no matter which House you call your own. For the rest of the rules, check here.
So what are the options for a starving freshman returning from crew practice or a Cabot resident who finds himself down by the river?  Well, you can go to Winthrop for dinner after 7 p.m., befriend someone in a river house and become their “plus one” a few nights a week, or try to swipe a sticker for your ID. Otherwise there is always Felipe's. Good luck!

Just as the True Love Revolution debate has been winding down in the States, Der Spiegel—one of Germany's widest-circulating magazines—published a tongue-in-cheek account of abstinence within Harvard's "ivy-clad walls." But seriously, who needs Gregor P. Von Schmitz to tell them that no one at Harvard has sex?
Von Schmitz, though, is quite familiar with the German-speaking world's insatiable thirst for information on Harvard's, apparently satiable, sex drive. A quick web search revealed that he authored Der Speigel's 2004 special on H-Bomb (including a photo album of scantily clad "Harvards Elitestudenten").
After trying and failing to translate the text online, we were lucky enough to find a German expat capable of explaining the subtleties of the country’s obsession with Harvard's perpetually maligned libido.
The article, playfully titled "Unimädchen-Report" after a series of enormously popular German pornographic videos, satirically mocks abstinence on college campuses.
In the piece, Von Schmitz characterizes TLR’s Co-President Rachel L. Wagley '11 as an "abstinence apostle" crusading "against carnal lust."
Von Schmitz pokes fun at Wagley's claim that "'those who engage in premarital sex are more prone to depression and more likely to get divorced'" by snarkily reminding Der Spiegel's readers that "she just read some brand new scientific literature to this effect."
If you are afraid that an article portraying Harvard students as a bunch of prudes might have ruined your prospects for romance during your upcoming study-abroad in Munich, don't fret: Lena Chen '09-'10, infamous Harvard sex blogger, defends those Cantabs who may not qualify as "abstinence apostle[s]."
Chen, described in the article as a "sex-lover" who "enthralls the males on campus with her ultra-short miniskirts," informs Von Schmitz that "a strong woman would not be ashamed of premarital sex: 'It is unrealistic that every person that I actually have sex with is important to me. Sex simply feels good.’”
And, if Munich turns out to be a bust (no, not that kind of bust!), you still have much to look forward to at Harvard: weekly Stein Clubs and, apparently, the world’s fascination with what happens once the keg runs dry.

A Boston police officer was fired on Friday for sending an e-mail last July that contained racial slurs about African-American Studies Professor Henry Louis "Skip" Gates, Jr.
In his e-mail, Officer Justin Barrett, referred to Gates as a "jungle monkey.” The one-paragraph, page-long tirade was written in response to a column that was published in The Boston Globe in July about Gates' arrest.
For those of you who hadn't read the e-mail until now (don't worry, we didn't either), here are some noteworthy, or rather, outrageous highlights. We gave it a ridiculousness rating of 9.6 out of 10.
"Article writer, That was, by far, the worst article I've ever read." 
Thus begins the worst e-mail we've ever read.
"I am embarassed [sic] I paid the 1.50 for the paper..."
No worries! Read The Crimson instead. It's free.
"That paragraph was as pathetic as jungle monkey gibberish - I might as well ax you the question. 'Is this your first test at reporting?'" 
Uh...
"[Y]ou state Gates is 'this immensely famous expert on race' - you really have to be kidding me? Famous for what? Expert why and says who?"
Let's just say the rest of the e-mail pretty much speaks for itself.
"I am not a racist. but I am prejudice towards people who are stupid and pretend to stand up and preach for something they claim is freedom when it is merely attention because you do not receive enough of it in your little fear-dwelling circle of on-the-bandwagon followers."
The PDF version of the e-mail released by the Boston Police showed that the message had been sent from his BlackBerry. Just imagine how long this e-mail must have taken to type out on his BlackBerry—so much time to reconsider!

Competition does have its merits sometimes, especially when it could get you a free burrito. Boloco and Qdoba are fighting for customers today, encouraging deal seekers to trek through the snow for a warm burrito.
Every Wednesday, Harvard Square’s Qdoba gives its customers a chance to try their luck at a complimentary meal by rolling a die (though you usually have to ask for it). If you roll an odd number, your burrito could be free, but roll an even number and you'll have to pay for it.
At Boloco, there is no avoiding paying for a burrito (of any size), bowl, salad, or wrap, but if you buy something today, you can bring your receipt back on Thursday or Friday for a free meal of equal or lesser value.
According to an e-mail sent to its customers, Boloco is also promising that if 6,058 people make purchases at its New England restaurants today, the chain will celebrate its 13th Anniversary with a “Free Burrito Day."
Israel Martinez, manager of Boloco in Harvard Square, said these deals are a push to get people to weather the snow and come to Boloco.
“Get some courage and go outside…come in and join us in the restaurant here,” he said.

Currier House Masters Richard W. Wrangham and Elizabeth A. Ross will be taking a sabbatical next year. A Harvard Law School professor and a research coordinator at the Harvard School of Public Health will be taking their place while they are gone.
Unlike a number of other House Masters who have said their good-byes this year, Wrangham and Ross won't be leaving for good, but still...what's going on?
Ross sent the following e-mail to the Currier House community about half an hour ago.
Dear Currier
 
It is with decidedly mixed feelings that we are sending you this email to announce that for the next year, we will be taking a sabbatical in Europe and Africa.
On the one hand we are thrilled by the new opportunities that 2010-2011 will offer us. We will be based in Cambridge UK. Our expected highlights for the year will include two months spent living with Hadza hunter-gatherers in the savanna of northern Tanzania, an extended conference in Japan, touring in central Tanzania, and of course time in Uganda with Elizabeth’s Kasiisi schools project and Richard’s chimpanzee studies. Richard also hopes to edit a book on chimpanzee behavioral ecology, and make headway on a book about violence.
But on the other hand we are very sad not to be spending time next year here. In the last 18 months we have quickly come to regard Currier as our home. The extraordinary good will and wonderful sens of welcome that you have extended ever since our arrival makes us totally appreciate this warm-hearted house. We greatly regret that we will not be seeing the current Junior and Sophomore classes throughout your Senior and Junior years.
To make up for our disappointment at missing the 2010-2011 year we are delighted to say that we will return here for Commencement in May 2011, so that we can at least see the 2011 Seniors in your final Currier week!
We are very grateful to James L. Cavallaro and Nadejda Marques, who have been appointed as interim housemasters during our year away, for welcoming us to share Commencement 2011 with them. Currier is indeed fortunate to have Jim and Nadejda spending a year here. Associate Dean Suzy Nelson will announce their appointment tomorrow. Briefly, Jim Cavallaro has served as a clinical professor of law at Harvard Law School and executive director of the School’s Human Rights Program. Nadejda Marques is a research coordinator for the Cost of Inaction Project at the Harvard School of Public Health’s FXB Center for Health and Human Rights. We feel very confident that Currier will be in terrific hands.
 
All best wishes
 
Richard and Elizabeth
