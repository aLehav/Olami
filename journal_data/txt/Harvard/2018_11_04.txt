After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Ballet Company will celebrate its 25th anniversary season with “on quarter ” — a contemporary ballet performance that strips away traditional set confines to give the impression of a “backstage scene.”
One of the student directors, Anna K. Antongiorgi ’19 explained that the show is really about different moments that are often hidden from an audience's view. “It pushes the boundaries of where the stage is: People will be dancing in the aisles, people will be dancing with the booms,” Antongiorgi said.
The other student director, Mara G. Milner ’20, described how the curtain is purposefully flipped in the other direction to emphasize the “behind the scenes” sentiment of a production. Milner hopes the show will make the audience question their role within the performance. While the show is inventive, it still aligns with HBC’s history.
The entire show is set to Gershwin’s music and performed by student pianist Forrest G. Flesher ’21. Both live music and specifically a piece by Gershwin have previously been used in HBC performances, however this performance is choreographed with the intention of reinventing tradition. Choreographers were also intent on having “on quarter” speak to the history of HBC by incorporating elements from previous performances. They have also tapped into HBC lineage as two out of the 15 choreographers are alumni. Most pieces are choreographed by students, but two dancers, Elizabeth C. Walker ’11 and Anna Riley-Shepard ’1, have returned to Cambridge once more to contribute expertise for this special occasion.
Making the show cohesive with multiple moving elements is not necessarily an easy feat. Many of the contemporary dancers agree with this sentiment, including choreographer Angie Cui ’20. “It is stressful as a choreographer because there’s a lot to live up to, a lot of history we are trying to capture,” Cui said. There is a lot of pressure in trying to capture and portray the dancer experience: a world of challenges and nuances so specific to this industry. “on quarter” celebrates both old and new. “It is a performance that commemorates what HBC has been for the past 25 years, but also pushes the company in a new direction,” Antongiorgi said.
“on quarter” will run this and next weekend at the Loeb MainStage: Nov. 3, Nov. 8, Nov. 9 at 8 p.m., and Nov. 4, Nov. 10 at 2 p.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like its handsome but zombie-like protagonist, “El Ángel” is dressed up in beautiful cinematographic frills but lacks an emotional core. Directed by the up-and-coming Luis Ortega and produced by the illustrious Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar, “El Ángel” is Argentina’s official submission to the 2019 Academy Awards and is based on the criminal career of the country’s longest-serving prisoner and most notorious serial killer, Carlos Robledo Puch. The film amounts to a desensitizing concatenation of point-blank shootings — a surprising disappointment, given Almodóvar’s ability to evoke both voyeuristic anticipation and overwhelming emotion with the violent scenes in his own films, like “Volver” and “The Skin I Live In.” Only towards the end does Ortega place the unsettlingly impassive Carlos (Lorenzo Ferro) in the larger world when he emerges from a police car to a crowd of gawking onlookers who are beside themselves with fear and admiration. The real-life media harped on the incongruity between Puch’s criminal proclivities and his good looks, hence his nickname, “The Angel of Death.” One newspaper headline mentions Carlos’s “dubious sexuality,” evincing the public’s fascination with his personal entanglements over the details of his heinous crimes (11 murders, innumerable armed robberies, and the rape of several women). More interesting than the vacant incarnation of Puch in this film is the national project that built his mythic clout and celebrity through the biased media attention that Ortega only spotlights at the end. “El Ángel” is ultimately a bland rehashing of the bare-bones, empirical events of Puch’s career, as Ortega, in favor of obsessive aestheticization, papers over details that demand creative dramatization.
Set in 1970s Buenos Aires, the film begins with a chillingly sober voiceover by a teenage Carlos as he rummages through drawers in a stranger’s sumptuous bedroom. He doesn’t stop once he pockets everything he needs, but puts a record on and dances, swiveling on his feet with the impudent, unhurried confidence that becomes his trademark. He declares, “We all have a destiny. I was born a thief.” He forges a partnership with the object of his quiet infatuation, the surly Ramón (Chino Darín), and they enlist the help of Ramón’s father, who has his own criminal past. Together, they rob an armory, a jeweler, and an elderly man’s mansion in the countryside. Along the way, Carlos senselessly kills a series of unwitting victims and later, his own accomplices.
Ortega’s overeager showmanship allows him to create effectively pressurized moments of sexual tension, as he trains the camera on curious, cockeyed gazes for a moment too long, on lips upturned in suggestive smirks, and on Carlos’s bobbing neck as he swigs water. Carlos thrills visibly when Ramón’s father places his hands on his hips and shows him how to shoot a handgun. In some eerily beautiful scenes, Ortega recalls Almodóvar with his meticulous attention to color and lighting, and his geometric exactitude. Carlos unravels Ramón’s towel while he’s asleep, and places the jewels they’ve stolen on his crotch, as the camera pans out to luxuriate in patterns of saturated blues and oranges on furniture and on the walls, so that the room suddenly resembles an aquarium, and the gems an underwater treasure.
Despite occasionally successful aesthetic flourishes, Ortega traffics in weirdness in a way that is more alienating than intriguing and that doesn’t even serve an ostensible narrative purpose. People are as strangely impassive as Carlos is and engage in stilted conversations. Even Carlos’s well-meaning parents resemble the subjects of melancholic Renaissance portraiture. Then, there is the surreal moment when Carlos shoots the elderly proprietor of a countryside mansion, and the doddering man staggers up to the landing to stare fixedly at an abstract painting of naked bodies and ghoulish faces limned in lurid ink. He then sits on the toilet to urinate, still bleeding from his wound, without having spoken a word. It’s difficult not to suspect at this point that one has stumbled upon an ecosystem of drugged lab rats.
Ortega also neglects to approach Carlos’s disturbed interiority from a discernible angle beyond his swaggering, devil-may-care attitude. The unwritten class tensions in this world suggest that their criminal behavior might serve as a refusal to let society put them in a middling place, as Ramón says, “The world belongs to outlaws and artists… Everybody else has to work for a living.” But such underlying concerns are only hinted at, as Ortega’s perspective remains decidedly omniscient, uncritical, and hands-off despite the rich history he has at his disposal. He could have meditated on the role of the media in an era where biases based on physiognomy commanded destructive authority. Toward the end of the film, a clinical assessment of Carlos intimates the miasmic homophobia of the 1980s: “This is an odd specimen who’s broken the Lombrosian theories that tie natural born criminals with physical ugliness… It’s uncertain if his alleged sexual deviation influenced his acts.” Some were actually disabused of the notion that Puch was wholly responsible for his actions, exemplifying the irrational human weakness for physical beauty: “Society blames the parents of the monster for not putting limits or keeping him in check.”
But enough projecting what could have been. Ortega uses highly stylized cinematography and dialogue to affect the same enigmatic allure as the protagonist, but never arrives at an artfully elliptical purpose. Ultimately, nothing happens that couldn’t be gleaned from Puch’s Wikipedia page. Everything is enchanting to look at, shiny to touch, but none of that matters much given how diligently Ortega masquerades this unjustly insipid story.

On Oct. 18, the Boston Asian American Film Festival (BAAFF) celebrated its tenth anniversary with an opening night screening of “The Joy Luck Club” in Brattle Theatre. Rosalind Chao, one of the stars of the film, joined Boston Globe interim editor Shirley Leung for a pre-screening Q&A about “The Joy Luck Club” and its legacy.
Much of the prescreening conversation compared “The Joy Luck Club” to “Crazy Rich Asians.” Directed by Wayne Wang, “The Joy Luck Club” came out 25 years ago and was the first major Hollywood production to have a predominantly Asian cast. “Crazy Rich Asians,” which was released this summer, was the second. “The tie between ‘Joy Luck Club’ and ‘Crazy Rich Asians’ has a long history between the two,” Susan Chinsen, BAAFF’s festival director, said in her welcome address to the audience. “Many of the creatives that were involved in [‘The Joy Luck Club’] have set a foundation for all the work that has led us to be able to have successes like ‘Crazy Rich Asians.’”
According to Chao, however, “The Joy Luck Club” did not have as large an impact as she had hoped. “I knew the book was monumental,” Chao said, referring to the best-selling Amy Tan novel from which the film was adapted. “But [the film] didn’t quite have the effect, the long-lasting effect, that I’m hoping ‘Crazy Rich Asians’ will.”
Chao noted that there has been a significant difference in the reception of the two films. “[The Joy Luck Club] didn’t have the huge explosion that is happening right now with ‘Crazy Rich Asians,’” she said, “and I do believe that’s partly because of social media and partly because the Asian American community wasn’t quite ready to embrace each other… whereas now I feel like the Asian American community is very supportive of each other.”
When asked whether she expected “Crazy Rich Asians” to be a bigger turning point for Asian American representation than “The Joy Luck Club,” Chao responded optimistically. “Jon Chu, the director [of ‘Crazy Rich Asians’], just opened the door, and now we’re all rushing through that door… ‘Mulan’ is going to be an all-Asian cast,” she said, noting that she will play Mulan’s mother in the upcoming live-action adaptation of the Disney classic. “[There will be] a lot of really gorgeous Asian American males [in ‘Mulan’],” Chao added, eliciting cheers from the audience. “You have to have Asian American male representation and sexy guys out there, so we’re not invisible!”
Such progress in Asian American representation was further reflected in the growth of the Boston Asian American Film Festival itself. Before Chao’s Q&A, Chinsen briefly outlined the history of BAAFF and highlighted the diverse array of films that would be shown this year. In honor of BAAFF’s tenth anniversary, the festival was expanded from four days to 11. “We have over 50 films, and we’ll be hosting 40+ filmmakers and artists here this week,” Chinsen said, before inviting the filmmakers in attendance to introduce themselves.
Several of the filmmakers explained that their films were part of the festival’s “Queer & Here” short film program, which aims to elevate the stories of the Asian American LGBTQ community. “Like Mother, Like Daughter,” which centers on a transgender Vietnamese American woman, was one of the short films in the “Queer & Here” program. Kady Le, the film’s writer-director, reflected on the significance of “The Joy Luck Club” in her life as a first-generation American. “I wanted to see this movie because I remember seeing it for the first time in high school,” she said. “I just remember, when I was 16 years old, having that movie move me to tears because of how close and authentic it felt to my own experiences as a daughter of immigrants... Even though it was from a different generation, like in the ’90s, I think it speaks to Asian Americans today.”
Other attendees of the screening were similarly enthusiastic about “The Joy Luck Club.” Yiran Wang, an audience member from Shanghai, appreciated the film’s ability to resonate with Asians as well as Asian Americans. “I read the book and really loved it… It brought me to tears, and the movie [did] as well,” Wang said. “I’m not Asian American, I’m just Asian, but [the film] still speaks to a lot of my experiences, and I feel very moved and happy.”
Another audience member, Harvard alumna Margaret Ronan Stack ’80, returned to Cambridge to see the film. “It’s the first time I’ve been to the Asian American Film Festival,” she said. “I read this book a long time ago and never saw the movie, and it just brought the whole book back to me. It’s fascinating. I think it’s a great idea to have this film festival.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

“Measure for Measure” has quite a bit of a bad rap as a “problem play” — for good reason. Twisting plots and clever disguises aside, at its heart, it focuses on a deeply unsettling incident of sexual harassment. In their production of William Shakespeare’s work, which showed at the Emerson Cutler Majestic Theater from Oct. 24 to 28, Cheek by Jowl and The Pushkin Theater deftly succeeded in confronting the troubling nature of the material while celebrating the play’s hilarity.
A series of moral tests anchors the turbulent plot. In order to bring order and purity back to his morally depraved city, the Duke of Vienna Vincentio (Alexander Arsentyev) leaves town, leaving his dutiful and frigid subordinate Angelo (Andrei Kuzichev) in charge to clean up the nest of brothel and taverns that are corrupting the city. Shortly after, the Duke goes undercover, posing as Friar Lodowick to observe what ensues. After closing down taverns across town, Angelo apprehends and charges young Claudio (Petr Rykov) with impregnating his lover Juliet (Anastasia Lebedeva). Claudio’s sister and novice nun Isabella (Anna Vardevanian) pleads for a lighter sentence for the offense, trying as hard as she can to soften the new Duke, but is quickly surprised when she is instead propositioned for sex by the lascivious and hypocritical Angelo. She is given an impossible and terrible choice: Claudio’s freedom in exchange for her virginity or her beloved brother’s death.
Though performed in Russian by an all-Russian cast, a panel elevated above the sparsely set stage displayed Shakespeare’s words so that English-speaking viewers could also watch. Fitted in contemporary costumes, the cast succeeded in bringing redemption to the central characters while animating the bawdy ones of its underworld. More than anything, it was the darkly comic side characters who stole the stage, notably Alexander Feklistov as Claudio’s friend Lucio. His lines are naturally imbued with humor, but in the hands of Feklistov the character truly blossomed. His timing, absurd gesticulations, and delivery were impeccable. Arsentyev was also marvelous, heavily leaning into the irony of his character’s situation and largely satirizing the Duke’s savior complex.
For the most part, the simple staging helped to focus the attention on the actors’ craft. A series of industrial hanging lamps created a sober atmosphere, while the harsh lighting also invoked a sense of secrecy due to the many shadows it cast across the stage. Four large red boxes in the formation of a “U” were also constantly present on stage. These were later revealed to be rotating chambers and were used to show different scenes occurring simultaneously.
For the most part, actors delivered their monologues to the audience and to the group of players who were present on stage but not in scenes. This group acted as a silent chorus, reacting to what was occurring or sometimes mimicking the actions of the characters delivering monologues. This often meant that the character referred to in the monologue stepped forward and was spoken to as if truly present, rather than remaining merely figments of the speaker’s consciousness. This choice worked very well, as it added another layer of tension and strain.
The play also featured a number of small waltzes between characters to polka-style Russian folk music. After being told by his sister that he will be put to death and that she will not sacrifice her virtue for him, Claudio begins to play the double bass, sitting on it rather oddly from the side. The dances were brief but good transitions to the next scenes, and added to the strongly Russian identity of this production.
Perhaps where the play seems to go too far is in its decision to blatantly portray Claudio’s and Isabella’s relationship as a sexual one. Of course, there are subtle undertones of incest in the play itself. Critics point to Isabella’s rather sadomasochistic and seductive speeches in the first act or her direct invocation of the word: “Is't not a kind of incest, to take life / From thine own sister's shame?” (3.1.152-3). Yet this depiction wasn’t entirely convincing. During the scene where Isabella visits her brother to tell him about Angelo’s proposition, the siblings fight in a scene that rapidly devolves into what appears to be an aborted sex act. This happens so quickly that it almost might not even have occurred — further suggesting that it need not have occured at all.
Despite this flaw, the production is altogether very fresh and entertaining. With strong performances by the whole cast and a simple but effective set, the production stunned. Even the occasional glance away from the translation never led to any confusion: The players were emotive, clearly attesting to the brilliance of this production.

Totally bamboozled about your concentration? Stressed beyond words about the upcoming declaration deadline? We asked Flyby sophomores why they picked their field of study — or the fields of study they're still choosing between. Welcome to Why I Declared 2018.
Economics: Hannah J. Humes
Coming in my freshman year, I was sure I would end up either in engineering or as a pre-med. Everyone in my family is either a doctor or pre-med (weird flex, yes), so there was a lot of pressure to choose a career path in medicine. However, when I took an economics course instead of the standard LS1a, I realized that the math and problems in economics not only made more sense to me, but also were much more intriguing. Taking more courses has only made me more sure of my love for the mathematics of economics (nerdy, I know). Now, I think I want to become an environmental economists and use the theories I learned about in school to create change in the world I see around me. I understand the snake connotations the economics concentration has, and while I may sell my soul to the investment banks, consulting groups, or hedge funds to get that bread for a few years, a job at Goldman is not the reason I chose my concentration. Economic theory captures insights about the world that make sense to me, and learning to develop these models will be the way that I can implement change.
Economics: Sahara W. Kirwan
I declared my concentration in Economics 12 days ago, and you know what that means: an artsy post on my Instagram story in front of Littauer Center of Public Administration, home to the Ec Department. Not five minutes had passed before I received several replies to my story, all saying “Snake” or variations of that: “Snek,” just the snake emoji...you get the idea. But to me, studying Economics isn’t about how much money I might make later on (although I won't complain) — any degree from Harvard will get you to where you want to be financially, as long as you put that degree to good use and work hard.
I chose Economics because I just can’t see myself studying anything else. I’m someone who loves math, but not enough to study just math, and who loves the humanities, but not enough to study just the humanities. Economics is the perfect middle ground for me. I can study the behavior of people and the way firms operate, or how people should behave and how firms should operate in theory, and then apply just the right amount of calculus to make these abstract concepts concrete and real to me. I’m also a Libra, so I’m all about achieving balance and (market) equilibrium.
Government: Lorenzo F. Manuali
At the end of the day, governments control a lot of the big events of the world — good or bad. They create economic prosperity, carry out genocides, uphold human rights, and create international institutions. Yes, most people recognize government as that thing that steals part of their paycheck, but it's obviously far more complex than that. Governments — especially modern ones — affect almost every aspect of our lives. Whether you believe this should be the case or not, understanding how government works is really important for understanding how the world functions. Thus, a Gov concentration also offers me flexibility in my career choice later on, whatever that may be. From markets to foreign policy and culture, Government concentrators can learn about a variety of topics, making it in my view one of the best concentrations.
I’ve also loved current events ever since I was a kid. When I was in 5th grade, I drew up a peace plan for the Middle East. While giving a third of Jerusalem to The Vatican may seem weird in hindsight, it certainly was indicative of my enthusiasm for the subject. In high school, I joined the debate team, where I argued with other debaters about events of the day. Despite the weekends spent in the middle of nowhere (and yes, Yale), I loved every minute. While I also love psychology, government is the natural choice for me.
Social Studies: Cindy Li
As I toil away, making barely a dent in Alexis de Tocqueville’s Democracy in America, why I am concentrating in Social Studies begins to seem more and more like a valid question. Entering Harvard, I knew that I wanted to go into business. Why not concentrate in Economics, you ask? I have one word: Ec10. More importantly, I lack the inclination to be likened to a certain scaly reptile. In all seriousness, I have always been a lover of the social sciences and didn’t want to confine myself to just economics or government or sociology or history. Coming from someone whose favorite ice cream order is “the Sampler,” Social Studies is the concentration for the one who wants it all.
Even though I still have nightmares thinking about the thesis I will one day have to write and am already groaning thinking about all the people I will have to deliver the “No, I am not concentrating in middle school history” speech to, I’m proud and excited to be declaring Social Studies.
