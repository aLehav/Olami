After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, shuttles teeming with crimson-clad Harvard students will descend upon New Haven, kicking off the 130th episode of the annual ritual known succinctly as “The Game.” But for the many students who made the pilgrimage in 2011—when Yale last hosted Harvard—the pregame festivities Saturday will appear markedly more reserved this time around. In response to a U-Haul accident during the 2011 game’s tailgate which killed one tailgater and injured two others, Yale has tightened its tailgating regulations; for example, students this year can expect a ban on kegs and a shorter tailgate ending at kickoff. These policies may look heavy-handed, but there must be an emphasis on responsibility at The Game—one that was absent in the tragic accident in 2011.
It is not hard to imagine that tailgates can get out of hand. Even less so to imagine that thousands of excited Harvard and Yale students, assembled for the biggest sporting event of the year, could create a dangerous tailgating environment. And although the 2011 accident was not the direct fault of alcohol, we needn’t wait for an incident involving alcohol to consider enacting responsible tailgating rules. Instead, in the wake of tragedy, we must reevaluate all policies—not only those involving U-Haul trucks—in order to promote a safer experience for tailgaters.
We should note that these changes are not a kneejerk response by Yale but a step forward in a continuing dialogue about how to make tailgating a fun but safe experience for students and alumni. Harvard, for its part, banned U-Haul trucks in 2004. The next year, Yale followed with new tailgating regulations, and since then, both Harvard and Yale have periodically instituted new rules to ensure student safety. And while we have long been critical of Harvard’s draconian tailgating policies, we consider Yale’s decision a sensible reaction to an accident that exposed the shortcomings of its tailgating policies and the resulting responsibility gap.
Of course, given the complicated nature of crafting tailgate rules, it is better to err on the side of caution, even if the changes appear heavy-handed. Nevertheless, both Yale and Harvard should take student feedback into account and work with student organizations to come to mutually agreeable rules. After all, student feedback is the best indicator of how students will respond to new rules; in the absence of a student-administration dialogue, increasingly strict policies could push tailgating into dorms and off-campus houses, altogether defeating the purpose of tightening regulations. We cannot prescribe the exact route that Yale should take moving forward, but we hope that Yale will take students’ concerns—like those of Harvard’s House Committees—into account to ensure that its changes are having the desired effect.
At the end of the day—or, at least, at the 12 p.m. kickoff—what’s important is that student are able to enjoy this great tradition as safely and responsibly as college students possibly can. Whatever the merits of the specific new policies, we commend Yale for taking measures to promote a safe tailgating environment. And if nothing else, at least Harvard students will be released from their tailgates early enough to watch the Yale football team get pulverized—for the seventh time in a row.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From November 18 to November 21, Harvard students have the opportunity to vote on an Undergraduate Council referendum that seeks to ban the sale of plastic water bottles on campus and increase the availability of tap water sources such as filling stations. Proponents of the proposal have hailed it as commonsense measure, claiming the ban would represent a commitment to protecting the environment. Banning plastic water bottles, which are inarguably harmful to the environment, would have important symbolic implications, but the very real negative consequences of implementing such a ban far outweigh the symbolic victory that would come with its passage. Instead of approving this misguided proposal, we should look for more efficient ways to tackle this problem.
The environmental damage caused by disposing plastic water bottles is a textbook case of a negative externality. The ban proposes to reduce the damage of this externality by limiting the choice of the consumers. Limiting consumer choice, however, is extremely problematic on an economic level and often brings with it a number of unintended consequences.
At the University of Vermont, which recently banned the sale of water bottles, students bought over 350,000 bottles of water yearly before the ban. It is reasonable to project that the sales revenues lost from banning water bottles would not be insignificant. This fall in revenues could lead to either lower pay or fewer student-employees being hired at student-run establishments that sell water bottles, such as Lamont Café. Employment opportunities represent a valuable part of Harvard financial aid packages, and limiting sales at Harvard establishments hinders Harvard’s ability to pay its students fair wages.
Furthermore, when consumers are no longer able to purchase a preferred good, they often choose to purchase a substitutable, or similar, good. In this case, that means that students might purchase bottled sodas in place of the banned bottled water. Few would argue that this is the ideal outcome. In addition to causing the same environmental harm as bottled water, bottled soda is also a danger to students’ health.
Students who do not switch to soda might instead buy bottled water from other stores in Harvard Square. Because these alternate purchasing locations are not as convenient as on-campus locations, students might choose to buy bottled water in bulk so as to limit the time they spend buying water. Because of this, students who previously consumed bottled water infrequently and only out of necessity might actually consume more of it, since they would have bulk quantities on hand.
Fortunately, there is an alternate option for reducing Harvard’s consumption of bottled water that avoids or lessens all of the aforementioned consequences: incentivizing consumer behavior. The second portion of the proposed referendum, the building of more tap water fill stations, is a great example of a proposal that incentivizes behavior. Because tap water is free and bottled water expensive, students should naturally consume less bottled water and use the free tap water instead once it is made more accessible through the fill stations.
Another way to incentivize students to purchase few water bottles would be to impose a University tax on bottled water. By raising the price students must pay for bottled water, the tax would cause students to purchase less water, reducing the detrimental environmental impact of the bottles. Furthermore, the University could then use some of the tax revenues to supplement employee pay to ensure that the tax does not result in lower salaries for student-employees. The remaining tax revenues could then be used to fund other environmental initiatives, including the building of more filling stations. Coupling a bottled water tax with a program to increase tap water accessibility would thus present a much more efficient solution to reducing Harvard’s environmental impact than would an outright ban on bottled water.
Aside from its direct inefficiencies, the proposed ban also creates problems for the image of environmentalism. Because banning bottled water represents an encroachment on individual choice and consumer freedom, such a policy invites criticism on an ideological level. As I have previously stated, there is considerable danger in taking a radical tact on an issue that could be more effectively solved by a moderate approach. An outright ban of water bottles offers easy fodder for conservative pundits bent on opposing the cause of environmentalism, making it easy for such pundits to label proponents of this policy as radicals who are willing to overlook any and all individual freedoms in order to achieve their aims. Inviting these kinds of attacks on environmentalism is ultimately harmful to the larger goal of convincing more people to recognize the necessity of environmental consciousness. An incentive-based approach would avoid these sorts of attacks by preserving the choice of the consumer, allowing the progress of environmentalism to go unhindered.
Because the current proposal does not solve the issue at hand in an efficient and responsible manner, we should vote “no” as an affirmation that we can devise a better solution.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is a Mexican saying about America: “Aquí todo está mejor.” Everything is better here. My siblings and I grew up hearing this phrase over and over from my parents, followed by a lengthy talk about how lucky we were to have a deep sense of security, a great school district, and food to eat. Because we were young and couldn’t remember a lot about Mexico, we just took our parents’ word for it.
Along with the many seen, there were many unseen sacrifices my parents made to come here—their communication with family, their livelihoods in Mexico, their careers, their friendships. I remember when my mom received a call telling her that my grandfather had died and knew she would not be able to return. My parents were forced to leave the country they loved when they recognized our family would not survive. With hope and determination to work and earn, not take, they brought my family to Texas, the promised land.
As we grew older, things began to change. The passage of the Patriot Act disallowed my dad from continuing to work as a builder for a chemical plant. His spinal injury also worsened, and my mom began desperately taking a variety of jobs as a house cleaner and janitor.
My brother, sisters, and I did our best to try and fit in with our friends. We would nag our mom into buying us the latest and most stylish stuff, something that has since become one of my biggest regrets. Through it all, my parents remained selfless. Never earning enough to save, resorting to the cheapest forms of alternative medicine for their illnesses, and knowingly not treating severe medical issues.
Although life in America is significantly better for my family, it has its dangers and drawbacks as well. Our life in Houston became one of fear, a fear originally of deportation became an ever-present fear of any legal consequence. There is no way of measuring this significant stress and its impact on my family, or the permanent damage it has caused. But growing up, it became an integral part of my experience.
No matter how well I did in school or how close I got to my best friends, it seemed like all of my experiences were mixed with fear, secrecy, a sense of being undeserving, illegitimacy, invisibility, and a heavy form of guilt. We would hear the opinions at school, in the library, or among our friends’ parents: “They don’t belong,” “They don’t deserve,” or to my ears, “They aren’t as good.” You believe everything you hear as a child.
Discretion became key. It encompassed everything in life. Our formative years continued with this thing we hated about ourselves in the back of our minds. At home, although we barely got by financially my parents were determined to see us complete high school. In retrospect, this wasn’t even a reasonable goal. High school diploma or not, my siblings and I would only be able to take the minimum wage jobs my parents already had.
Everything changed when my older sister graduated as valedictorian of her graduating class and enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin. There were ways for us to enroll in college; there were people out there helping undocumented students. These thoughts blew my mind. One year later, I enrolled at Harvard. A year after that, my little brother enrolled at Middlebury in Vermont.
Now what? As the law stands, my siblings, other undocumented undergraduates, and I have only postponed our days of working in construction, restaurants, and whatever we find. Once we graduate, we will need to support my parents like they did for us all those years. I want nothing more than to help my community and my country, but survival comes first.
Why should Harvard care? As a model liberal arts institution that aims “to remove restraints on students’ full participation” in the Harvard community, Harvard has an obligation to advocate on behalf of its undocumented students so that they may “develop their full intellectual and human potential.”
The current system contradicts Harvard’s mission. Every year, Harvard accepts, aids, invests in, and graduates a small but consistent number of undocumented students. All have their own stories of triumph and despairs, stories in which Harvard will play a key role, and not only for four years. Each day that our country waits to give these undocumented students and their families a pathway to citizenship is one more day that we delay fulfilling Harvard’s best interests. Harvard has already picked a side in this argument, formally affirming its support for the DREAM Act, and it would not make sense for Harvard to abandon me, and the rest of its undocumented students now. It is in this light that we should view the UC referendum question four on “Harvard officially endorsing comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship.”
Ultimately this isn’t an economic, political, or a specifically undocumented Harvard student issue. It’s a human issue, and one that I feel obligated to speak about as my own family continues to face abuse, discrimination, violations of rights, and inequality. It’s a question of putting education into action.
There’s a voice that tells me I do belong at this University—it’s the same voice that echoes Harvard’s ideals.
Join me in amplifying this voice. Vote yes on Question Four on the UC Referendum.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At The Harvard Shop, where I work part-time as a sales associate, Harvard ID holders get 20 percent off almost everything in the store. In practice, people who make use of this discount are usually first-year undergraduates, middle-aged adults in expensive two-week executive education programs, and Harvard staff who desperately need an umbrella on their way to work. Sometimes, though, I run into boundary cases. A research assistant at a Harvard-affiliated hospital. A contracted worker with a temporary access pass that looks like a student ID. Do these people hold Harvard IDs? It’s a question that should never come up outside of the very constructed situation of The Harvard Shop’s discount—but who holds a Harvard ID might have significant implications for “who belongs” in the Harvard community.
A few years ago, Aviva Chomsky wrote a short essay on the oft-unquestioned privilege of holding a U.S. Passport. Chomsky notes, “When you get your U.S. passport in the mail, it comes with a flyer that says ‘With your U.S. passport, the World is Yours!’”—yet most who can easily obtain a U.S. passport don’t even realize the extensive access and legal protection they gain by holding one. I am afraid that in Harvard’s growing empire, the Harvard ID may come to take some of the same significance of the U.S. passport in allowing access to space and power.
Two years ago, while the students and workers of Occupy Harvard set up a tent city in Harvard Yard, our administration shut the Yard off to all but Harvard ID holders. Although Harvard administrators professed their concern for student safety, in practice, this policy excluded reporters, tourists, and Cambridge residents who have walked through Harvard Yard on their way to work or school every day for many years longer than I’ve been a student. The policy also, for a time, excluded Extension School students, who do not all have Harvard IDs.
Writing last week about the newly-announced plans for the Smith Campus Center on the site we know as the Holyoke Center, Harry Lewis imagines a potential dystopian future in which Harvard’s new campus center becomes “a sort of sterilized version of the Harvard community, safe from infection by the neighbors, with Harvard restaurants and cafés open only to Harvard ID holders.” Lewis decries the idea that an ID-accessible three-story campus center would truly cultivate community. “Is part of the idea of drawing the Harvard community together to make it possible to withdraw from the daily life of Harvard Square?” he writes. “All of the blooming, buzzing, non-Harvard confusion that you have to navigate to walk around Harvard is what makes Harvard Harvard.”
University identification cards are a useful means of establishing access to physical buildings on campus. It makes sense that Harvard IDs contain chips which can be swiped so that certain Harvard affiliates can gain access to the otherwise closed buildings that they study, teach, and work in. But what happens when possession of a Harvard ID becomes the defining line between who is allowed in and who isn’t—a ticket into an exclusive space?
During the shutdown of Harvard Yard, the Harvard ID became a certificate of legitimate belonging to the Harvard community. So how does Harvard decide who merits an ID? Clearly, students and staff on campus should have an ID card, as well as staff who work off-campus but might need to access on-campus facilities. But what about those who work for Harvard but far away? What about Extension School students, or students receiving degrees on HarvardX? And what makes a part-time lecturer more a part of Harvard than a Cambridge resident who has rented an apartment from Harvard, attended public lectures at Harvard, and walked through Harvard Yard for the past few decades?
Harvard shouldn’t define its community based on who holds a Harvard ID. Harvard’s neighbors and workers deserve access to space and recognition at our university.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council Election Commission confirmed Tuesday night that it will change the voting system for the ongoing UC election from the traditional Hare-Clark method to a plurality method after the Commission inadvertently violated election rules by disallowing voters from ranking all three tickets.
In an email from the Election Commission to all UC presidential and vice presidential candidates shortly before 10 p.m. Monday, Commission chair Wesley K. Chen ’15 explained that his group had opened voting Monday at noon without allowing voters the option to rank tickets, as is the norm.
The Election Commission, whose members are confirmed by the Council but operate independently of the UC, runs all elections for the Council.
Part IX of the Commission’s Official Rules for Presidential Elections, the document that governs the November elections, mandates that voters must be allowed to preferentially rank all tickets and requires that the Commission tally votes according to the Hare-Clark voting system. Under that system, if the number of first-place votes for a single ticket does not constitute a majority, then the ticket with the lowest number of first-place votes is dropped and its votes are reassigned based on voters’ second choices. The process continues until a ticket claims a majority of the votes.
The Commission’s email, obtained by The Crimson, went on to propose that a plurality system be adopted. Under such a system, the ticket that receives the most votes wins.
Chen argued in the email that given the number of students who had already cast their ballots, an election do-over “would be a complete mess.” In an interview with The Crimson after the email was sent Tuesday night, Chen said that he believed both voting systems are “fair” and that there was no particular reason why one system should be preferred to another.
By 12 a.m. Wednesday, over 2500 undergraduates had already cast a ballot in the election, which features three UC tickets—Samuel B. Clark ’15 and Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15, C.C. Gong ’15 and Sietse K. Goffard ’15, and Chika-Dike O. Nwokike ’15 and Una Kim ’15—as well as four student-initiated referendum questions.
Chen confirmed that a representative from each of the three tickets had submitted an emailed statement fully agreeing to the switch in the vote tabulation model.
Chen also said that he was responsible for the error, explaining that he had been given no guidance from previous Commission chairs on how to operate the back end of the electronic voting infrastructure.
“The back end of the voting system was created quite a few years ago, and the access to the back end has been lost over time,” Chen said. “There was nothing regarding how to set it up.”
Based on conversations between the Commission and the UC, Chen said that the two bodies are considering making the plurality vote system permanent for future elections to avoid repeating the same mistake in years to come.
Electronic voting will close Thursday at noon, and election results are expected to be announced Thursday night.

Since voting opened for the Undergraduate Council elections on Monday, the C.C. Gong ’15 and Sietse K. Goffard ’15 campaign has earned more endorsement from student groups than the other two tickets—Chika-Dike Nwokike ’15 and Una Kim ’15 and Samuel B. Clark ’15 and Gus A. Mayopoulous ’15—combined.
Gong and Goffard have garnered the endorsements of the Harvard Democrats, Harvard Republican Society, Queer Students and Allies, Latinas Unidas, The Crimson, Woodbridge International Society, Harvard Habitat for Humanity, Catholic Students Association, The Social Innovation Collaboration, and the Asian-American Society. Additionally, according to Gong, “93 percent of the UC supports our ticket.”
“We have gotten the endorsements of every student organization we’ve met with and heard back from, which means the other tickets haven’t gotten a single endorsement,” said Gong in an email to The Crimson.
However, the Clark-Mayopoulous ticket reported the endorsements of the Voice Actors Guild, Satire V, and On Harvard Time. Additionally, Nwokike and Kim have been endorsed by the Black Men’s Forum, the Association of Black Harvard Women, and the Korean Association, according to Nwokike.
In addition to gaining group endorsements, tickets have launched volunteer teams and Facebook campaigns to attract voters.
The Gong-Goffard ticket has built a team of 60 core members and more than 200 other volunteers to “get out the vote,” Gong said.
According to an internal document provided to The Crimson detailing campaign infrastructure, the team is composed of four campaign managers, various levels of advisors and strategists, directors of policy and communications, a creative team, two “hypemasters,” and specific coordinators for finance, web pages, and election rules.
The Nwokike and Kim ticket preferred to keep the size and structure of their campaign secret.
“We would like to keep all internal campaign intel within our campaign staffers only,” wrote Arthur A. Raiford ’15, a campaign volunteer, in an email to The Crimson.
“We don’t want to leak out too much information,” said Nwokike, echoing Raiford’s sentiments.
Mercedes N. Flowers ’16, a volunteer for the Clark-Mayopoulous ticket, speculated that there are “at least a dozen but probably more” students working for that campaign.
Taylor K. Phillips ’15, the Clark-Mayopoulous campaign manager, described their team as “an army...sort of like Dumbledore’s Army in Harry Potter” in an email to The Crimson.
Volunteers have spent much of their time putting posters up around campus, speaking to friends, and publicizing their candidates.
Ingrid Y. Li ’17, a Yard Captain for Gong-Goffard, said that she has been reaching out to fellow freshmen by knocking on doors. “I feel like it’s so worthwhile...I have a lot of faith in their ideas,” Li said.
Candidates and their volunteers are also working to create a strong online presence by sharing posts from campaign Facebook pages and developing personalized websites.
The Facebook page for Gong and Goffard has reached over 400 likes, while Mayopoulous and Clark’s page, subtitled “You Could Do Worse,” has surged to almost 800 likes. Nwokike and Kim do not have an official Facebook page, but both they and Gong and Goffard have constructed websites that showcase their platforms.
Even with the campaign teams’ strategic outreach efforts, some voters are still unsure of the importance of the UC election.
“As a freshman, I don’t feel like the UC has really made it clear to me why I should be engaged with the UC,” Colin A. Mark ’17 said. “This interview was the first time I found out there were platforms available to read.”
Joe C. Dechario ’14 was unsure of the candidates names, saying that, “The only people I know are the funny guys.”
Meanwhile, other students read the platforms and had mixed responses.
Javier F. Aranzales ’16 said that Clark and Mayopoulous stand out, but the Nwokike-Kim platform seemed “doable...like a checklist.”
Eli D. Lee ’17 had read the platforms and said they were not “substantively different” from each other but still plans to vote.
When asked if the UC has an impact, David G. Su ’14 said, “I’m sure they do. I personally don’t feel it...but I definitely know that they’re doing a lot.”

The National Science Foundation is expected to reduce the number of grants for university research from 11,000 to 10,000 per year after this spring’s federal sequester. How this downsizing will affect Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences—which receives 80 percent of its federal monies from NSF, according to school administrators—is still unclear, causing the school to anticipate cuts and to look to finding alternative funding sources.
The cuts, which went into effect in March after lawmakers failed to agree on a plan to reduce the federal budget, will be implemented over the next nine years, with $85 billion of budget reductions expected in this fiscal year alone.
Universities have been particularly affected by the cuts. The federal government provides roughly $30 billion a year to universities for research, an amount that is expected to drop by at least $1 billion per year.
Calling the situation “frightening,” SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray said that the school is expecting less federal research funds in the near future.
Yet despite the large share of funding coming from the federal government, professors and administrators remain cautiously optimistic about the future.
Currently, SEAS receives approximately 75 percent of its research funding from the federal government, 20 percent from industry partnerships, and 5 percent from various foundations, according to Brunelli, although she said this balance fluctuates from day to day.
“I’m not predicting that SEAS is going to have to make dramatic changes in how it operates,” said Associate Dean for Research Administration at SEAS Carleen A. Brunelli, who also provided the 80 percent figure.
The sequester is not expected to impact all areas of research equally, Brunelli said, and the nature of SEAS research potentially puts the school in a better position than other schools at Harvard.
“You can see in the not too distant future what the application of [SEAS] research is and that’s one of the things that will be less apt to get the big cuts going forward,” Brunelli said. “Politicians want to know what are we going to get out of this, where is it going to go, and how is it going to impact the economy and our other industries.”
Brunelli also spoke of plans to increase SEAS research funding fromindustry sources. She said that the school has been working in the last few months to facilitate the process of matching SEAS researchers with industries who would be willing to support them.
One successful industry partnership has been with German chemical company BASF. Brunelli said that this partnership is an example of an umbrella agreement, with the company providing a set amount of research funding per year and working in collaboration with SEAS faculty members on projects of mutual interest.
David A. Weitz, faculty director of the BASF Advanced Research Initiative at Harvard University, said that he views increasing industry partnerships as a viable way forward for SEAS, because they provide sources of both funding and intellectual inspiration. Industry partners approach the researchers with a problem—a recent example was the difficulty of dissolving some types of drugs in water, Weitz said—and researchers work to find a practical solution.
“There are opportunities for researchers at Harvard to engage with corporate research to actually make a difference to the companies and do very good science,” Weitz said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though University President Drew G. Faust emphasized that the new Richard A. & Susan F. Smith Campus Center would foster “One University” for all Harvard students, many students across the University remain skeptical about whether Faust’s goal can be accomplished.
During an announcement for the new student space last Thursday, Faust and other University officials said that new Smith Campus Center will serve not only as an undergraduate facility, but also as a common space for the entire University.
However, students from both the College and various graduate schools said that they are doubtful of whether the space will be utilized by both undergraduates from all classes and graduate students alike.
Many undergraduate students interviewed by The Crimson expressed concerns that the location of the new campus center will be more convenient for freshmen than upperclassmen.
Amanda M. Brandt ’17 said she thinks that it will be easier for freshmen, rather than upperclassmen, to stop by during the day. Brandt said that the Campus Center may help bring together the freshman class, but not necessarily the entire University.
Jane Jacob ’16 also said that upperclassmen will not need to seek out the campus center as much as freshmen will. While freshmen only have Annenberg as a dining hall option, upperclassmen have a wide array of Houses from which to choose, Jacob said.
While undergraduates students are doubtful of whether the space will be beneficial for all classes, graduate students interviewed by The Crimson also noted the distance of the new student center from their respective campuses.
“I probably won’t use it because my campus is in Boston, not in Cambridge,” said Xindi Hu, a student at the Harvard School of Public Health.
Hu said that she believed that students at the Business and Medical Schools would apply the same logic as well, while students at the Schools of Education, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences will use the space more.
Like other graduate students, Summer A. Shafer, the president of the Harvard GSAS Graduate Student Council, said that the the Smith Campus Center offers graduate students no real incentive to take advantage of the space.
“I can’t see students from the Longwood area coming into Cambridge just to ‘hang out,’” she said.
Some students also noted that the Law School in particular has it’s own recently constructed student center to foster student unity. Anatol E. Klass ’17 said that students at the Law School may not be attracted to a new University center when they have a new, spacious center of their own closer to their classes.
However, not all reactions to the student center were negative. Some students said that the presence of cafes, restaurants, or lounge spaces might attract more students. “If there was food involved, students will totally show up,” Jacob said.
Nevertheless, Shafer said she doesn’t believe that any space can achieve the “One University” goal that Faust and the other University officials cited during the announcement.
This rhetoric, Shafer said, “makes for great fundraising, but doesn’t reflect the real, material needs of graduate students.”

Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health published a “striking” study in JAMA Pediatrics that suggests that young males may be more susceptible to eating disorders than is commonly perceived.
Among the many findings of the study, researchers showed that 17.9 percent of teenage males were “extremely concerned” about their bodies.
“Much of what we know about is a presentation of eating disorders among young women,” said Kendrin R. Sonneville, an instructor in pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and second author of the study. “We’re sort of embarking on an area that is understudied.”
As a part of a larger study called ‘Growing Up Today,’ the paper provided more information about the long-term effects of various health factors such as diet, exercise, alcohol use, and body image. In the context of the larger study, which has spanned nearly two decades and included survey information from thousands of children and adolescents, this HSPH study focuses exclusively on young males.
Alison Field, associate professor of pediatrics and co-author of the study, suggested that the findings showed that males with eating disorders were most similar to females who engaged in purging but did not binge-eat.  Like these women, the men tended to be more likely than their peers to use drugs and to drink.
“These boys were about two times as likely to start binge drinking frequently and start using drugs other than marijuana,” Field said.
The survey also found that eight percent of the males surveyed were concerned with muscularity and used steroids, growth hormones, or other products that may be unhealthy.
“That was really striking to us, that the numbers were that high,” Field said.
Sonneville says that solving the problem of distorted body images amongst males is about changing perceptions.
“This is a much bigger problem than the medical community is aware of,” Sonneville said. “The fact of the matter is that it affects boys and girls from all racial and ethnic backgrounds and of all different socioeconomic groups and of all ages.”
Field also stressed the importance of parents and doctors in screening the mentalities of young people.
“Anybody who is extremely concerned with their weight …or their perception of their appearance and is willing to use whatever behaviors or means it takes to achieve that physique—that’s equally unhealthy for males and females.”
The researchers suggested that the first step in addressing the issue is to identify the problem.
“We live in a society, unfortunately, that puts way too much emphasis on appearance,” Field said. “You need to really talk to them and figure out why is it that they think changing their weight is going to change everything in their life.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will be abuzz with more than just tourists and students rushing to class, thanks to a $2500 grant to the Harvard Undergraduate Beekeepers awarded from the Office of Sustainability.
The Undergraduate Beekeepers plans to assemble beehives across campus and test pollen samples for chemical residue, following an organic landscaping program in 2008 that sought to eliminate the use of pesticides and herbicides across 90 acres of Harvard property.
“Honeybee hives are a direct indicator of environmental health,” said Li E. K. Murphy ’15, co-president of the organization. “Harvard has this huge commitment to organic landscaping, and we want to define its impact.”
The Undergraduate Beekeepers, who work to raise awareness about the importance of bees to the environment and human life, will use the hives to conduct research how the health of honeybee colonies is affected when foraging in an urban ecosystem free of pesticides. The group already maintains one hive in the Pforzheimer Breezeway.
“Our long term goal is to set up a couple of hives on campus so we’re overlapping the whole area,” said Harvard School of Public Health professor Chensheng A. Lu, who is the faculty advisor for the organization.
In 2008, Harvard launched an organic landscaping program that eliminated use of pesticides and herbicides across 90 acres of Harvard property, including Harvard Yard. In its place, Campus Services uses organic methods, such as compost teas, to maintain Harvard’s landscaping.
Lu, whose research has recently analyzed the chronic effects of pesticides on honeybee colonies, said he hoped the project would expand beyond the Undergraduate Beekeepers to students who are interested in studying honeybees.
Likewise, Alice S. Han ’16, a member of the Harvard Undergraduate Beekeepers who has been with the group since its inception in 2012, said she hoped the project would spread awareness to students about the importance of bees to humans.
“We should be more ecologically responsible about taking care of bees,” Han said. “They pollinate all these plants that we consume. Without them, many of our foods would no longer be existent.”
The Undergraduate Beekeepers’ project still needs to be approved by Harvard Environmental Health and Safety, according to the Office for Sustainability.
However, the Student Sustainability Grant Program has already endorsed the project, which could eventually become a longer-term study.
“It’s exciting to see students trying to better understand the implications of human activity on bee populations and the urban landscape,” Heather Henriksen, Director of the Office for Sustainability, wrote in a statement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study commemorated the 50th anniversary of Betty Friedan’s book “The Feminine Mystique” Tuesday by hosting a panel discussion on the evolution of gender roles since the book’s release and the book’s relevance to contemporary American society.
The panel was moderated by History Professor Nancy F. Cott, who directs The Schlesinger Library, which houses Friedan’s papers.
Panelists included Evergreen State College Professor Stephanie Coontz, who recently published a book on American women in the 1960s, and Columbia Law School Professor Ariela R. Dubler ’94, who specializes in constitutional and family law.
“The event was [held] to mark this fiftieth [anniversary] to reflect on Friedan’s importance, but I had decided that it might be more interesting for audiences today to think about the contemporary world rather than again hash over Friedan,” Cott said.
Throughout the panel, Coontz focused her remarks on the progress that has been made in achieving gender equity since the publication of “The Feminine Mystique”.
“This is not your grandfather’s patriarchy. We are not living in even your father’s privilege,” Coontz said.
Despite acknowledging these improvements, however, Coontz also emphasized that much has yet to be achieved.
“The mechanisms [of] gender inequality are now much more circuitous, much more indirect than they used to be,” she said. “The ways in which this inequality [has] changed have made it necessary, I think, in one ironic way, to go back to Friedan’s book.”
Dubler echoed Coontz’s statements and said that she was “incredibly stuck” at the state of the conversation on gender roles fifty years after “The Feminine Mystique”.
“This country is still collectively engaged in a very gendered conversation among and about women and about home and work,” she said.
Among the other topics discussed during the two-hour conversation, both Coontz and Dubler said that the problem of work-family balance should not apply solely to women.
“[Work-family balance] is still a conversation that assumes that work and family is fraught terrain for women and just a way of life for men,” Dubler said, citing Barack Obama’s recent commencement speech at Barnard College as an example.
Those who attended the event said that they enjoyed listening to the panelists speak about their areas of expertise and relate contemporary issues to Friedan’s 50-year-old book.
“I thought the event was incredibly impressive. I thought it really brought the conversation to today in a very optimistic way but yet not ignoring the issues that still underlie our society,” Allison A. Hill-Edgar ’94 said.
“I do a lot of lectures around the country where I just pop off for an hour straight... so it was a lot more fun to have the give and take with the other person, ask interesting questions, and then to leave a lot of time for the audience,” Coontz said.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: November 21, 2013
An earlier version of this article missquoted Columbia Law School Professor Ariela R. Dubler ’94 as saying that the contemporary discussion assumes that balancing work and family is "fraught to reign for women," while in fact Dubler described it as "fraught terrain for women."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Wednesday evening, former Bruin and NHL legend Bobby Orr will be in Cambridge to sign copies of his achievement-filled autobiography. Merely a short walk across the river on that same night, the Harvard men’s ice hockey team and the Boston College Eagles will vie for achievements of their own in the crosstown matchup.
“It’s a rivalry,” sophomore forward Jimmy Vesey said. “Both teams are not that far apart…. There’s definitely something on the line.”
Less than a week ago, the Crimson (3-4-1, 2-4-1 ECAC) snapped a four-game losing streak with a 5-3 win over Princeton. Prior to the losing streak, Harvard upset No. 10 Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a 2-0 victory.
“A lot of things are clicking for us, you know, even though we lost those few games,” freshman forward Tyler Moy said. “I feel like we actually deserve a lot more than what we ended up getting, but it was definitely nice at Princeton.”
Boston College, however, will prove to be more of a challenge. Ranked No. 7 with a 7-2-2 overall record, the Eagles come into the game with an average of 4.45 points per game, the best in the NCAA. BC will also feature the top-ranked scorer in the nation, junior Johnny Gaudreau, a 2011 fourth-round draft pick by the Calgary Flames.
Despite the statistical advantages of Boston College, Harvard still has a chance of playing right at the level of the Eagles. Such a performance was on display in last Friday’s close loss against No. 4 Quinnipiac, where the Crimson fell short by just a point after a last-minute surge.
The Bobcats, with a season record of 11-1-1, narrowly escaped the comeback after a no-goal review with less than a minute to go and consequently won the game, 3-2.
“Anyone can beat anyone,” Moy said. “We [put in] a lot towards the end there, it could’ve easily gone the other way. There were a bit too many penalties, and we got ourselves in a hole, so I feel that the outcome of that game could have easily been changed, one shot or another. But I mean, I think that playing those tough games…gives us perspective that we can handle these types of games and it’s not something that we should be intimidated by.”
On that point, Vesey agrees.
“That game could’ve went either way,” he said. “They’re one of the best teams in the country, so I think we’re feeling good about tomorrow.”
In Harvard’s 120th matchup against Boston College, Vesey will have a chance to keep his recent goal streak alive. The 2012-13 Ivy League Rookie of the Year has scored at least one goal in the past four games he has played, totaling six goals so far this year. Sophomore forward Brian Hart will also have a chance to showcase his skills, having at least a single assist in the past four games.
“I’m just going to try to do whatever it takes for the team to win,” Vesey said. “There’s a lot more than scoring goals. Boston College is a high offense team, so…we’ll take it from there.”
Veteran goalkeeper Raphael Girard, on the other hand, will look to hold his own on the defensive side of the game. Girard, who leads the nation in both save percentage (.955) and goals against average (1.52), has shut out two teams in four starts.
“I think we have two good goalies,” Vesey said. “Both played very well this season, and I’m not sure which one’s going to start tomorrow, but I think goaltending is more of a strength, and it could be a difference.”
The Eagles currently have an eight-game win streak against the Crimson, last losing to Harvard in 2006. The Crimson will look to take advantage of this past weekend’s momentum to snap the streak Wednesday night.
“We don’t get to play them [as much], being in different leagues,” Moy said. “So it’s always good to play a crosstown rival. I didn’t get too much of it growing up; being in San Diego, most of the teams were in LA…so I’m happy to jump into this new rivalry here in Boston for the next four years. It should be a fun game. It’s always great to play when you’re somewhere close to home, especially when the other team is pretty good, too.”

After outscoring their first three opponents by an average of 28 points, the Harvard men’s basketball team (3-0) shouldn’t see much standing in the way of another victory in Wednesday’s home game against Bryant (2-1), except a transfer from the Ivy League.
Bulldogs guard Dyami Starks, who came to Bryant from Columbia after his freshman year, leads the nation in scoring, averaging 33.3 points per game in the team’s first three games of the season.
The Crimson is well aware of Starks’ scoring proficiency and is hoping to contain him, but the team realizes it will require a concerted effort.
“We’re really trying to play defense as a team,” senior captain Laurent Rivard said. “We’ll definitely have our individual assignments. But it will be a team effort to defend [Starks]. We just need to be cautious of where he is on the break or in the half court.”
Harvard coach Tommy Amaker recognizes the capabilities of a team whose only loss is to No. 13/12 Gonzaga. Bryant has further caught the Crimson’s attention by notching an early victory over Ivy League foe Dartmouth on its home court.
“We have our hands full,” Amaker said. “There’s no question about [Stark’s] ability on the perimeter. They’re a good basketball team. As much as anything, I think they bring a sense of confidence right now.”
Starks is not the only member of the high-scoring Bulldogs who presents a challenge to the Crimson. Senior forward Alex Francis currently sits 460 points away from being the first player in Northeast Conference history with 2,000 career points and was selected for the the First Team All-NEC as a junior.
Francis and Starks provide a significant one-two punch for Bryant, giving them the ability to play inside-out as they rotate between perimeter scoring and physical low post play. In addition, Francis is averaging over seven rebounds per game.
“[Covering Stark and Francis] will still be a team effort,” Amaker said. “It’s not going to be one or two guys that have to do it by themselves. We never think that’s the right philosophy. You can get so fixated on guys who have these kinds of numbers that you take your eyes off other players that end up becoming the difference, and you’re not prepared to deal with them.”
Tonight’s game will likely be won by the team that can provide a stronger defense, as both squads have demonstrated their high-scoring tendencies. Harvard has averaged 79 points per game, while Bryant is scoring over 83 per contest.
The Bulldogs have limited the scoring opportunities of their previous opponents by alternating between full court press, zone, and man-to-man defensive strategies. Amaker has noted these tendencies and has planned accordingly.
“We need to be in attack mode and have some great pace and rhythm about us no matter what defense they’re in,” Amaker said. “We’re hoping we won’t get thrown off or get out of whack by a change in defense.”
Unquestionably, Harvard’s defense will be tested tonight, especially due to the stricter calling of fouls this season on defense. After experiencing foul trouble in the past few games, Amaker hopes to use this aggressive style of play to limit and frustrate the Bulldogs without giving them unnecessary points from the free throw line.
“You have to stick with your identity and your philosophy, and we need to see if we can play our defense without fouling,” Amaker said. “If you’re not alert and aware, your concentration isn’t at the height that it should be, and you end up giving silly fouls, and those are the ones that are very disappointing.”
Unexpected injuries have led the Crimson to turn to the bench in search of some points and defensive assistance, with Amaker mentioning junior Jonah Travis and sophomore Agunwa Okolie as potentially key contributors in the absence of Kenyatta Smith and Brandyn Curry.
“We’re looking at it as an opportunity for other players to get better and grow in confidence and get extended minutes,” Amaker said. “I think they’ve really taken advantage of it.”
Harvard is looking to dominate at home, hoping to use the next month before Ivy League play to optimize multiple facets of its game before opening the conference season against Dartmouth on January 11.
“All the teams that we’ve played so far have had different styles of play and a different emphasis on what they do, and then we have to deal with that accordingly,” Amaker said. “Learning with our program in terms of personnel, and then growing once we get everyone healthy so we’re able to find a rhythm down the road will hopefully prepare us as we keep moving forward throughout the season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a 16-game winning streak at Lavietes Pavilion on the line, the Harvard women’s basketball team was feeling the pressure as it left the court for halftime with a 32-23 deficit on the scoreboard.
After a first half defined by turnovers and missed opportunities, the Crimson (3-1) came out of halftime, cleaned up sloppy passes, and took control of the rebounding game. With these adjustments, the team finally reclaimed the lead with just over five minutes left on the game clock and managed to prevail over Florida International (0-3), 64-52, preserving its undefeated home record.
Momentum started to fall onto the side of the Crimson halfway through the second half when senior forward Elise Gordon recovered a loose ball and sneaked the pass to a wide open sophomore forward AnnMarie Healy, who was waiting for a layup under the goal.
The play marked the first time Harvard had taken the lead since five minutes into the first period.
“We got open shots because we played good defense,” co-captain Christine Clark said. “We played big defense, and shots came out of it.”
Seconds after Healy’s play, senior guard Jasmine Evans hit a three-pointer that further solidified the lead for the Crimson.
“We had a lot of really great shots [in the second half],” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “Elise had some great shots, Clark had some great takes, [and] Ali and Kit both hit some big threes for us.”
With 27 points coming off of the bench, the victory was a team effort through and through. Although the team’s leading scorer, Clark, led the squad with 21 points, several others contributed as well to secure the game.
“I think that we came together really nicely,” Gordon said. “We faced a little bit of adversity going into the second half, but we did a really good job of coming together and facing this adversity as a team, rather than trying to take it upon ourselves individually.”
Emerging victorious after struggling in the first half was a major accomplishment for the Crimson. After a slow start notched just 23 points in the first half, Harvard nearly doubled its offensive output, pouring in 41 points after halftime.
“This game showed how tough our team is,” Clark said. “It showed how much we’ve grown from last year. Coming back and playing like we did after shots weren’t falling is a testament to how tough we are and how good we can be this season.”
Going into the second half, the Crimson had to make some big adjustments in order to keep FIU from widening the gap.
“Basically, it was a get-on-your-girl strategy,” Gordon said. “It was about making sure everybody knew that we had help defensively and knowing that we had each other’s backs.”
Along with turning the heat up defensively, the Crimson also began to take control on the offensive side as well, as it began to grab key rebounds and shots began falling on the right side of the net.
In the first half alone, the Crimson registered 14 turnovers, eight more than it had recorded in last week’s entire match against North Dakota. The home team turned this around after halftime, only coughing up the ball twice in the second half.
“Nothing went right the first half,” Delaney-Smith said. “Our reaction to that was turning the ball over way too much, and that was my giant criticism. We were trying to do things too quick, and that’s not the way you play that sort of team.”
FIU also had its fair share of turnovers in the first half, but the difference was that the Panthers capitalized on the Crimson’s mistakes. As Harvard missed shot after shot, FIU continued to use the offensive turnovers to its advantage, going on a 20-4 run in the half to extend its lead.
“Everything about our offense was ugly,” Delaney-Smith said. “We had to play smart and execute better.”
A further weakness from the Crimson’s offense stemmed from Clark’s early foul trouble. The senior guard, consistently Harvard’s top scorer, was kept on the bench for much of the first half after tallying two fouls early on.
Harvard’s defense had its own fair share of troubles in the first 20 minutes, as FIU guard Jerica Coley, the 2013 Sun Belt Conference Player of the Year, scored 16 points on the Crimson defense before halftime, accounting for half of the number on the scoreboard for the Panthers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although the Harvard men’s basketball schedule said that Wednesday’s contest was a home game, anyone at Lavietes Pavilion tonight would beg to differ.
A full Bryant student section, however, would not be enough for the Bulldogs to stay with the Crimson in the second half, as a 16-2 Harvard run propelled it to a lead it would not relinquish. In the end, Harvard came out on top, 86-68.
The streak only began after the Bulldogs rolled off six consecutive points, reducing their deficit to single digits.  A layup by junior Alex Francis, followed by four made free throws from sophomore Dyanmi Starks, cut the Crimson lead to eight, setting up the biggest run of the game.
With 8:26 remaining, Harvard junior wing Wesley Saunders knocked down two shots from the charity stripe, instigating an almost four-minute span in which the Crimson faced little offensive competition from Bryant.
Less than a minute after Saunders’ trip to the line, a block by junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi sent Harvard running in transition. Junior Alex Nesbitt threw the ball ahead to Saunders, setting in motion a series of passes that ended with Moundou-Missi collecting the ball on the right block, dribbling twice across the lane, and finishing the possession with a lefty lay-up.
“That was a real big block,” Saunders said. “That was a real momentum swing. Steve was flying around everywhere tonight.… He was a monster [tonight].”
On the subsequent possession, Moundou-Missi knocked down a short baseline jumper, extending the lead to 14. The junior would score four more times before the Crimson’s run ended, leading to a career high 23 points for the Cameroon native. Moundou-Missi also tallied nine rebounds and four blocks, both game-highs.
“I thought Steve played exceptionally well,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “It was obvious that he was active, he was finishing around the goal…[overall, it was] an outstanding performance from him.”
After Bulldog Corey Maynard completed an and-one, Harvard’s streak was over. The damage, however, was already done. From that point on, Bryant would not come within 17 points of the home team.
While it was Harvard’s offense that lit up the scoreboard in the second half, Amaker attributed the extension of his team’s lead to its efforts on the defensive end.
“[At the beginning of the run] we switched defenses a little bit,” Amaker explained. “I thought that helped us; maybe threw them out of sync, out of rhythm. We play[ed] some zone for just for a few possessions, and I thought that allowed us to get some stops and some run-outs, which I thought gave us a great deal of confidence.”
The Crimson notched 11 blocks on the night, with senior Kyle Casey, junior Jonah Travis, and Saunders each adding two to Moundou-Missi’s four.
It was Saunders’ defense on Starks, however, that stole the defensive spotlight. The Bulldog guard came into Wednesday night averaging a nation-high 33.3 points per game. After 40 minutes against Saunders, that average dropped significantly, as he totaled only 11 points on three-for-10 shooting.
Along with his efforts on the defensive end, including three steals and two blocks, Saunders contributed 25 points and five assists on the offensive side of things, the latter being just two shy of his career-high.
Wednesday’s match-up marked the first time all season that the Crimson shot over 50 percent from the field.
Such offensive efficiency began on the very first possession, as just 14 seconds after the opening tip, Casey slammed home a cross-court alley-oop pass from Saunders. Bryant proceeded to tie the score on the next possession, following a give-and-go between Francis and Maynard that led the latter to lay the ball in at the 19:22 mark.
The back-and-forth scoring would continue until several strong put-backs from Moundou-Missi enabled the Crimson to stretch its lead to as many as 12 in the opening period.
With an assortment of mismatches and the lead hovering around 10 for much of the game, the Harvard bench did not see as many minutes as it had of late.
“They’re not a very big team, so that limited us in terms of the amount of bigs that we could rotate through,” Amaker said. “[Additionally,] we never [felt] comfortable about where we were in terms of the lead. We never could feel that we had things stretched out…[to the point] where we could go to our bench.”
Wednesday’s contest marked the last time the Crimson plays at Lavietes for over a month, with the team traveling to Colorado and the Great Alaska Shootout next week.
“This was a big game for us,” Saunders said. “We wanted to start off our road trip on a good note…We came out with energy and [Bryant’s] crowd came out, which got us extra pumped up. It was intense for us playing against such…a great team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After 20 minutes, the Harvard men’s hockey team escaped the ice with a one-goal deficit. After being dominated 17-3 in the shots on goal department, the home team in some ways had stolen the period.
But the Crimson could not escape the top offense in the nation Tuesday night at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center. Boston College (7-2-2, 4-0-1 Hockey East) rolled to its ninth straight win over its cross-town rival with a 5-1 victory in its first game in Allston since 2009.
Two goals in the final two frames from NCAA division I scoring leader Johnny Gaudreau helped the Eagles put the game out of reach for Harvard. Junior BC goaltender Brian Billett made a game-high 34 saves and was perfect through 56 minutes.
After a flat-footed first period, Harvard was on the attack and looking to tie in the second. But BC responded with quick tape-to-tape passing.
Junior Destry Straight put the visitors up, 2-0, eight and a half minutes into the middle frame after the Eagles strung together four crisp passes in the Harvard zone.
Less than six minutes later, Gaudreau scored on a breakaway off a lead pass from senior linemate Bill Arnold.
“The second period we were a step behind Harvard, but we made those two really tic-tac-toe-type goals,” BC head coach Jerry York said.
Gaudreau added another goal just over two minutes into the third period with assists from sophomore defender Teddy Doherty and freshman forward Ryan Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald slid BC’s fifth goal by junior goalie Steve Michalek off passes from senior forward Kevin Hayes and Doherty.
BC took control early with a goal from freshman forward Austin Cangelosi about five minutes into the first period. A strong Eagle forecheck kept Harvard in its own zone for most of the frame.
“In the first period we were very lucky to come out of it only down one,” Harvard head coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We sat around and watched the first period.”
“I thought we played with a lot of anticipation here tonight,” York added. “The first period was our best period of the year so far.”
Less than 10 minutes into the period, sophomore Harvard defender Max Everson went down in the Crimson zone after taking an elbow to the head from BC captain Patrick Brown. Everson skated off the ice with the help of his teammates but would not return to the game.
Harvard bounced back in the second, outshooting BC, 15-9, and gaining some attacking momentum. But a couple of miscommunications on the defensive end prevented the Crimson from containing the visitors’ bursts of offensive firepower.
“I thought in the second we had some chances to get back in the game, and we just gave up goals too easily,” Donato said.
Gaudreau and Fitzgerald put Boston College up 5-0 in the third despite the Crimson’s increased pressure. Tensions rose late in the game as 42 penalty minutes were assessed in the last 10 minutes of regulation.
Harvard freshman defender Kevin Guiltinan and Bill Arnold exchanged pushes and grabs in the Harvard zone with six minutes left in reglation following a hit from Guiltinan on Gaudreau. Guiltinan and Arnold left the ice with game misconducts.
The Crimson’s lone break through on the night came three minutes later on a power play.
Freshman forward Luke Esposito scored his first collegiate goal off a rebound in the slot.
The mark spoiled a shutout for Billett, who turned away a game-high 16 Crimson shots in the third period.
Following the game, Donato said that his team has much to learn from the loss.
“They’re a very well coached, talented team and we weren’t good enough to give them a competitive game,” Donato said. “This is a tough team to play against and not be at your best.”
With the win, BC maintains an all-time series advantage of 71-44-5 over Harvard.
The Eagles have not lost to the Crimson since 2006.
Tuesday marks the Crimson’s last home game for more than a month. The team will travel to UNH next Tuesday before visiting Dartmouth, Brown, and Yale.

Let’s face it—most of us have been looking forward to Thanksgiving since Columbus Day weekend, especially since we had class on Veteran’s Day. Unfortunately, we’ll be waiting a long time, because if Thanksgiving decides to come any later, we might be celebrating it during spring break. While the consequences of this delayed celebration are numerous, here are four that get us more annoyed than tourists in our way taking photos of the John Harvard statue:
 
1. Less Time to Study for FinalsWe wouldn’t have gotten into Harvard if at least some part of us didn’t engage in/ secretly enjoy studying. Having Thanksgiving this late means that crucial cramming time is lost to the festivities, and let’s just say your living room is no Widener. To cope with this precarious situation, consider renting a U-Haul to transport your textbooks and course packs home to study.
2. More Stressful Stretch to ThanksgivingIt seems like EVERY midterm and paper is due immediately before Thanksgiving and immediately after The Game. This translates into a November of pure misery, leaving most of us grudgingly admitting that we would surrender our collegiate independence for a piece of turkey and a slice of apple pie.
 
3. Difficulty Fitting into Formal DressesWinter formals are coming up, and with them the obligatory dress shopping and formalwear rentals. Typically, there is enough time post T-Day to lose a bit of the bloat that accompanies the trip home. However, with Thanksgiving so far back, your dress clothes are going to be tighter than your schedule during shopping week.
 
4. Torturously High Ticket PricesDropping a couple hundred on tickets home (for the few Harvard Students not hailing from Massachusetts), doesn’t seem like a big deal when Thanksgiving and J-Term seem as far apart as Convocation and Commencement, but with less than a month separating the two, spending all of your term-time earnings on one trip home when you’re going home again in less than a month can be a tearful experience.

As the fall semester comes to a close, most of us have a grade (or four) that we want to bring up before it's too late. Whether you want to bring that A- up to an A (you grade-grubbing fool) or are just looking to pass, Flyby has a few tips.
 
1. Libraries still existAt this point, Lamont may seem like it has become your home. Or maybe your source of exercise comes from walking up Widener's steps. Either way, keep up the hard work. The unfortunate truth that you may just now be realizing is that libraries actually do lead to productivity.
 
2. AttendanceWhile this point may seem obvious, going to class will probably help improve your grade. We know it’s the end of semester and you have minimal motivation to go to your 9 a.m. SPU class that you never wanted to take in the first place. You only have a few weeks left. If you got into Harvard, you can probably wake up for class.
 
 
3. Harvard- YaleTry not to forget everything you learned while spending the weekend in New Haven. Attempt to be somewhat prepared for that exam you still can’t believe your professor scheduled for Monday.
 
 
4. If at first you don't succeed, participateBe that kid in section. In the fight for late-semester participation points, it's every man for himself.
 
5. Reading PeriodReading period is called reading period for a reason. Right? So open a book and get cracking.

The Harvard football team should have plenty to be happy about during the game this weekend. Players (and spectators if you feel like joining in), Flyby has come up with a few ways to keep your celebratory dances fresh—even after the 15th touchdown against Yale.
 
1. The Quad – Right after making your touchdown, go run to the other field and back. Only then will you actually be home (you could wait for the shuttle, but it will inevitably never show up).
2. The Capital Campaign – Isn’t every touchdown worth $6.5 billion? Make it rain like Drew Faust in her free time (when nobody’s watching).
3. The Premed – Wait, why are you busy playing football? Go do your homework.
4. The Dirty Laundry – Take off your jersey, remove it from an imaginary washer, give it a sniff, and thank God that you go to Harvard.
5. The Harvard Yard – As your teammates pretend they are tourists, taking photos of everything that moves, do the dance that every freshman has to every day in getting from their dorm to Annenberg.
6. The CS50 – Pound your head against the ground until things compile. Then run around shouting, “This is CS50.” That’s all there is to it.
7. The Lamonster – Pound your chest; give us a roar; and act like you’ve at least once stepped out of the library. Stereotypical Harvard football player.
