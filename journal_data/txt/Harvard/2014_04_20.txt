After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With only five minutes remaining in the Harvard men’s lacrosse team’s game against Princeton, the Crimson held on to a 9-8 lead by only a thread.
Before the game clock hit zero, the Tigers were able to get off a series of relatively open shots, but all went wide or hit the posts as the Harvard defense scrambled. Finally, with only 1:18 remaining, Princeton sophomore midfielder Jake Froccaro attempted what he hoped would be a game-tying goal. Instead, junior goaltender Jake Gambitsky saved the shot and the game for Harvard, as the Crimson (8-5, 4-1 Ivy) was able to beat the Tigers (7-5, 2-3) to the sideline and eventually clear the ball.
With seven consecutive goals in the first period, Harvard dominated the start of the contest before almost succumbing to a strong second half surge by Princeton. With the victory, the Crimson clinched a spot in the Ivy League postseason tournament.
“We came out on fire,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “But as Princeton started chipping away at the lead and as the game got closer, I was most proud of how the team kept its composure and poise and managed to finish a close game.“
The Tigers made it on the board first, with a goal by junior midfielder Kip Orban following what was the first of three straight faceoff wins for Princeton to begin the game.
But the Crimson answered with force. First, sophomore midfielder Sean Mahon nailed a shot after simply running past his defender, tying the contest. Harvard then took the lead when sophomore attackman Deke Burns caught a wild shot and quickly found sophomore attackman Devin Dwyer for a wide-open goal.
Next, sophomore midfielder Brendan Newman beat his defender in the middle of the field and buried a diving shot straight into the upper-right corner of the goal. Senior attackman and co-captain Peter Schwartz rounded out the quarter for the Crimson with another goal, putting his team up, 4-1.
However, the score discrepancy at this point did not represent the true balance of the game. The Harvard defense had given up several relatively easy shots to the Tigers, but other than the first attempt, each was turned away by Gambitsky.
“Jake played an exceptional game,” Wojcik said. “He didn’t just make saves, he made big saves. And those were really what let us build up our lead.”
In the second quarter, the Crimson began to dominate across the field. The team limited its turnovers, secured 75 percent of the ground balls in the quarter, and outshot Princeton, 13-3. Freshman midfielder Austin Williams won all five faceoffs in the second quarter, and went 13-of-19 over the course of the game.
And the goals just kept coming.
Following a Tiger penalty, Harvard capitalized on the man-up opportunity as Schwartz assisted sophomore attackman Will Walker for a goal. Senior attackman Carl Zimmerman then extended the lead, weaving through the Princeton defense until he got off a diving shot just before falling into the crease. Next, Schwartz found Dwyer creeping around the goal for an easy tally, giving Harvard the 7-1 lead.
Sophomore attackman Ryan Ambler scored for the Tigers off of a broken play, bringing the half to a close with the Crimson leading, 7-2.
“We came out really strong,” Schwartz said. “There was a lot of emotion playing on senior night at home, and all of the guys really came to play.”
Princeton came out of the break looking to close the gap, and Orban and Ambler each scored again, 38 seconds and five minutes into the half, respectively.
Sophomore defenseman Stephen Jahelka answered for Harvard, dodging a defender and driving to the goal for his first score of the season. However, Ambler followed the sophomore’s play with a goal of his own, bringing the game into the fourth quarter with Harvard’s advantage reduced to 8-5.
The bleeding continued as Princeton senior midfielder Tucker Shanley scored, cutting the lead down to just two. Once again, the Crimson answered, this time with another goal from Zimmerman. But goals from Princeton’s Froccaro and junior attackman Mike Macdonald narrowed the home team’s advantage to just one.
But Harvard refused to allow another goal and eventually managed to pull out the win.
“We showed resilience today,” Schwartz said. “Princeton is obviously very skilled, but we felt like we could outwork them. We have a group that is able to take advantage of our ability to out-hustle our opponents, and we really did that today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While club sports may arguably not receive the same amount of attention which their varsity counterparts attain, the athletes involved in these competitions deliver a similar amount of work and effort.
The dedication of two of Harvard’s club athletes were recognized by the Harvard University Athletics Department as senior Bridget Nestor and classmate Ibrahim Khan were honored as the 2014 Female and Male Club Sports Athlete of the Year out of more than 1,900 athletes throughout 65 sports.
Nestor, who is a captain and goalkeeper of the club women’s hockey team, led the Crimson in just its third year of play. As the one of the founders of the club, Nestor was in charge of organizing team trips, games, practices as well as team activities.
Nestor also shone in front of the net, leading Harvard to the semifinals of the Independent Women’s Club Hockey League Championship where they would fall to eventual undefeated champions Salem State. The senior also commanded the team to other displays such as holding then-No.2 and league runner-up Westfield State to a solitary goal in a 6-1 victory despite Westfield averaging six goals a contest coming into the match.
On the male side, Khan earned his award for the impressive work he has done with the cricket club team. As a captain of the Crimson, Khan scored over 400 runs from the lead-off spot, setting a single season record in the American College Cricket league, while ranking second in amount of wickets taken in the conference.
In addition to being named Club Sports Athlete of the Year, Khan was named the ACC Player of the Year as well as the ACC Player of the Tournament.
Khan is one of the founders of the Cricket club, and in addition to being invaluable to his team on the field, he helped organize the squad off the field by leading the efforts in fundraising, organizing team trips, as well as starting the club by finding both faculty advisors and sponsors for the team such as sports bar Hit Wicket.

YALE 8, HARVARD 2
 
After taking the first tilt of the four-game set in New Haven, Conn., Harvard (10-22, 5-9 Ivy) found itself in locked in a tight battle with the Bulldogs (15-19, 7-7) on Saturday evening. Down by one heading into the bottom of the seventh, the Crimson gave up four runs in the frame and fell, 8-2.
Junior starter Matt Timoney kept the game close, giving up two runs in 5.2 solid innings of work. Relief struggles on the mound hurt Harvard in this one, with each of the four Crimson pitchers giving up one or two runs and none finishing a full inning of work.
While Harvard finished the game with 10 hits, the offense also left nine runners on base. Yale countered with twelve hits of its own, with the one through four hitters finishing 8-for-15 with five runs batted in.
 
HARVARD 6, YALE 2
 
While a shaky first inning on the hill prevented him from earning a shutout, freshman Nick Gruener was dominant for his first win of the season. The hurler from Miami, Fla. gave up just one hit in his final six innings of work, and the Crimson cruised to a 6-2 win to start the series.
The Bulldogs jumped on Gruener their first time through the order, singling four times and taking advantage of an error to go up 2-0.
But the Harvard bats woke up with a bang in the third, fourth, and fifth innings, scoring two runs in each. By game’s end, the Crimson had tagged Yale starter David Hickey for six runs on ten hits.
Junior right fielder Brandon Kregel finished his day with two runs, two hits, and a stolen base out of the cleanup spot, while senior second baseman Kyle Larrow had two hits and a stolen base of his own.

The terrific run for Harvard men’s basketball continued last week, and in this case, it came in the form of an individual honor for one of its stars. Junior wing Wesley Saunders was named to the ECAC Division I All-Star second team, joining Billy Baron of Canisius, Aaron Craft of Ohio State, Bryce Cotton of Providence, and Malcolm Brogdon of Virginia on the select squad.
The award is the latest of many for Saunders, who has been a member of the All-Ivy League first team for the last two years. He was tabbed the Ivy League Player of the Year following an outstanding season during which he led the Crimson in points with 14.2 per game and finished second and third on the team in assists and rebounds per game, respectively.
Saunders has been one of the catalysts of Harvard’s historic success in recent seasons. He has earned the Raymond P. Lavietes ’36 Most Valuable Player Award for the past two seasons, on both occasions sharing the honor with point guard Siyani Chambers. During the Crimson’s back-to-back trips to the NCAA Tournament’s round of 32, the Los Angeles, Calif. native averaged almost 15 points per game in postseason play.
Saunders has been named Ivy League Player of the Week eight times in his career and currently ranks 31st all-time at Harvard with 1,012 total points for his career.
Past members of the ECAC Division 1 All-Star second team have included Oklahoma City Thunder guard Jeremy Lamb and Detroit Pistons forward Greg Monroe.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend proved to be another successful outing for both Harvard men’s heavyweight and lightweight crew teams.  The No. 3 heavyweights raced Princeton and MIT at home on the Charles River on Saturday, defeating both competitors to win the Compton Cup.  The No. 4 lightweights also had a strong showing, racing twice in one weekend.  On Saturday, the lightweights beat Navy on the Severn River to secure the Haines Cup.  The Crimson then travelled to Princeton, N.J. to sweep all three races against Georgetown.
HEAVYWEIGHTS
The Harvard heavyweights started its spring season with back-to-back wins against Cornell and Brown, and the Crimson continued to gain momentum with a decisive win over both Princeton and MIT.  The first varsity boat toppled the Tigers and Engineers to take home its eighth-straight Compton Cup.
“In general, it was a great day for Harvard rowing,” captain Andrew Holmes said. “We performed at a very high standard across the board, with all boats gaining speed throughout the week of practice leading up to the race with Princeton.”
The Crimson first varsity boat took an early lead over its competitors, and by the midway point of the race, Harvard had a half-length advantage over Princeton.  But the Tigers pushed the Crimson to the finish line, forcing a close race.  Harvard ultimately finished in 6:09.0, just over a second ahead of Princeton. Both Ivy League crews defeated MIT with an open-water lead.
The second varsity race was the closest of the morning. The Tigers took an early lead with an open-water advantage over the Crimson, but Harvard pushed through to ultimately finish 0.4 seconds ahead of Princeton with a time of 6:19.3.
“They didn't let the start of the race phase them,” Holmes said. “The boat found their rhythm and just ground down the opposition (Princeton) until they broke. It was a well-deserved victory for the crew as they have been showing all season that they have been the fastest crew in the second half of the race.”
The Crimson third varsity boat fell to the Tigers by a considerable margin, finishing in 6:44.9.
The Harvard fourth varsity eight had a close finish, but outlasted Princeton by half a second.
“I think the team has been improving every race, and I think this will be our main focus throughout the remainder of the season,” Holmes said. “Every week we aim to increase our speed a little bit, as every tenth of a second will count during the championship races."
LIGHTWEIGHTS
The Harvard lightweights kicked off the weekend with a strong performance against Navy on Saturday on the Severn River and followed up by sweeping Georgetown on Sunday.  The Crimson first varsity boat toppled the Midshipmen to capture their sixth-straight Haines Cup, and Harvard took five of six races on the morning.
“We thought it was a good weekend,” assistant coach Linda Muri said. “We had strong results both days against very good competition. [Navy] is a very physical team, so to be able to do that well is very good.”
The first varsity competition against the Midshipmen was the closest race on Saturday.  The Crimson finished in 6:05.3, 2.7 seconds ahead of Navy.  The Harvard second varsity boat recorded an open-water victory, finishing in 6:07.05.  The Crimson third varsity boat completed the varsity sweep by beating Navy by over 20 seconds with a time of 6:40.3.
The Harvard first freshman boat completed the course in 6:10.00, finishing over 13 seconds ahead of its competitors.  The second freshman rowers were the only boat to fall to Navy.
On Sunday, the Crimson lightweights continued on to Princeton, N.J. where the team faced Georgetown.
“I think they handled [the travel] very well,” Muri said. “In the long run it evens out, but I think the guys handled it very well in terms of staying quiet on the bus and hydrating and just getting ready for the recovery in between the two races.”
The Harvard first varsity boat posted a decisive victory over the Hoyas, finishing in 6:29.71 with a 13.09-second victory margin.  The Crimson second and third varsity boats raced together, both finishing ahead of Georgetown’s second boat.  The Harvard first and second freshman boats also toppled the Georgetown third varsity boat.
“We are always trying to get a little bit faster so that we are ready for the championship races,” Muri said. “We’ve still got about 7 weeks to go in terms of preparation and trying to fine tune, find a little more speed here and there, and a little more consistency.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sitting at 4-8 in Ivy League play, the Harvard baseball team knew it would have to win the weekend series against Yale to still have a shot at making a late-season run at the division title.
But after splitting Saturday’s games with the Bulldogs (17-19, 9-7 Ivy), the Crimson (10-24, 5-11) suffered two extra-inning nail-biter losses on Easter Sunday to fall four games off the division leading pace.
“It’s just one of those weekends where you come out 1-3, but you could have easily come away 3-1,” said senior second baseman Kyle Larrow. “It stings to look back and think about the things we could have done better…. You hate to have so many what if’s, but that was the case this weekend.”
YALE 7, HARVARD 6
Fresh off the tough loss earlier in the afternoon, Harvard found itself headed to extra innings once more. And for the second straight contest, the Bulldogs left the Crimson standing on the field after a game-winning base hit.
Harvard senior right hander Danny Moskovits had a rough second inning on the mound, giving up three runs—all unearned—on three hits, but threw six strong innings to put the Crimson in a position to earn a series split.
Though the Harvard bats came alive to plate six unanswered runs, the Crimson bullpen couldn’t maintain the lead, giving up four runs in three-plus innings of work in relief of Moskovits.
“We just have to move forward,” said junior right fielder Brandon Kregel. “We have to hit when it counts, pitch when it counts. When we’re down, we have to find a way to get back up.”
YALE 1, HARVARD 0
Before beginning the third game of the weekend, the Crimson knew that hits and runs would be a premium when the batters stepped into the box against Bulldogs ace Chris Lanham, who sported a 5-1 record coming into the afternoon.
Harvard sophomore Sean Poppen matched Lanham through seven shutout innings of work, but threw a wild pitch to put a runner on third with one out in Yale’s half of the eighth. Bulldog catcher Robert Baldwin then stepped up and hit the game winning sacrifice fly to left-centerfield, clinching the 1-0 win for Yale.
The Crimson could only muster two singles and a walk off Lanham, who faced three batters more than the minimum in eight shutout frames.
Poppen fell to 2-3, though he did not give up an extra-base knock in 7.2 innings on the hill.
YALE 8, HARVARD 2
After taking the first tilt of the four-game set in New Haven, Conn., Harvard found itself locked in a tight battle with the Bulldogs on Saturday evening. Down by one heading into the bottom of the seventh, the Crimson gave up four runs in the frame and fell, 8-2.
Junior starter Matt Timoney kept the game close, giving up two runs in 5.2 solid innings of work. Relief struggles on the mound hurt Harvard in this one, with each of the four Crimson pitchers giving up one or two runs, and none finishing a full inning of work.
While Harvard finished the game with 10 hits, it also left nine runners on base. Yale countered with 12 hits of its own, with the one through four hitters finishing 8-for-15 with five runs batted in.
HARVARD 6, YALE 2
While a shaky first inning on the hill prevented him from earning a shutout, freshman Nick Gruener was dominant for his first win of the season. The hurler gave up just one hit in his final six innings of work, and the Crimson cruised to a 6-2 win to start the series.
“I felt great, my changeup and curveball were working well,” Gruener said. “As soon as the team goes out there and helps you out by getting some runs, you’re really defending for them…. When we’re winning, I can go out there and do my thing, and the boys will back me up.”
After the Bulldogs jumped on Gruener their first time through the order, singling four times and taking advantage of an error to go up, 2-0, the freshman didn’t have much trouble.
And the Harvard bats woke up with a bang in the third, fourth, and fifth innings, scoring two in each frame. By the game’s end, the Crimson had tagged Yale starter David Hickey for six runs on ten hits.
Kregel finished his day with two runs, two hits, and a stolen base out of the cleanup spot, while Larrow had two hits and a stolen base of his own.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, the Harvard softball team travelled to Ivy League rival Yale for a pair of doubleheaders on Saturday and Sunday. The Crimson (27-11, 13-0 Ivy) employed solid pitching and an explosive offensive attack in order to sweep Yale (5-32, 1-15) with four convincing wins, maintaining its unblemished record in conference play.
The Crimson had been riding a program record 14-game win streak and had just swept Princeton in two games on Thursday. Coming into the weekend, both Harvard and Dartmouth were the sole undefeated teams in the Ancient Eight. However, after this weekend's sweep of the Bulldogs and Brown upsetting the Big Green, it's the Crimson in the driver's seat going into the final week of regular season play.
HARVARD 7, YALE 5
In the fourth contest of the weekend, it looked as though the Crimson’s sweep might have been in jeopardy when a three-run homer blasted by Yale’s Hannah Brennan in the third inning put the score at a lopsided 4-1.
However, the Crimson found the answer it needed when a three-run shot from junior shortstop Emily Gusse kicked off a six-run fourth inning for Harvard.
“Yale had just taken the lead...so when [junior pitcher] Laura [Riccardione] and [senior catcher] Allie [Scott]  got on base before me, I knew we had to capitalize and get ourselves back in the game,” Gusse said. “My mindset was to just swing at a good pitch and hit it hard.”
Ricciardone would hold Yale scoreless in the final three innings to earn her fourth win of the weekend, sealing a 7-5 victory for the Crimson.
HARVARD 11, YALE 3
In game three of the series, the Crimson’s bats came alive to put up double-digits on the board.
The first three innings of the game went by without a run for either team.
However, in the fourth, Scott scored on a throwing error from Yale’s right fielder, and the runs kept coming after that.
In the fifth frame, Harvard plated five more runs courtesy of four base hits and two Yale errors.
The Crimson struck hard again in the seventh when captain and right fielder Shelbi Olson roped a triple with the bases loaded for three RBIs. Olson was then hit home by freshman pinch hitter Lindsey Hagberg to increase the score to 11.
“Once we started to just relax up at bat, really wait for our pitch...we started to really produce those big hits to the fence,” Scott said. “So that was the key, just being patient and being confident at the plate.”
A late offensive rally by Yale would prove to be too little, too late, and the Crimson notched the win, 11-3.
HARVARD 6, YALE 2
After shutting out Yale in Saturday’s first contest, Harvard put together a game of solid team offense to get its second win of the series.
The Crimson created offensive opportunities for itself by hitting the ball well and stealing bases to put runners in scoring position. Five Harvard runners stole successfully, and two of those players would eventually come around to score.
“Something I think our offense prides itself on is the fact that we put a lot of pressure on the defense,” Scott said. “We have a lot of really fast girls . . . and when they’re stealing bases and they’re successful, it fuels our offense.”
Yale managed to put up eight hits and put pressure on the Crimson’s defense, but the Bulldogs struggled with runners in scoring position, limiting them to only two runs on the day.
With the score tied at 2-2 going into the sixth, Harvard’s designated player, freshman Savannah Bradley, hit an RBI triple and junior right fielder Andrea Del Conte followed with a two-run homer to put the Crimson out in front for good, allowing the Crimson to go on to win, 6-2.
HARVARD 5, YALE 0
Setting the tone for the rest of the series, the Crimson immediately leapt out to a five-run lead in the first two innings of the series’ opening game. Most of these runs came when Crimson batters hit their way on base and then scored on errors committed by Yale.
The only earned run for Harvard in this game came off the bat of captain third baseman Kasey Lange when she roped a single into right field to allow Olson to cross the plate from second base.
The story of this matchup was the complete game shutout thrown by Ricciardone. She would end the game with no runs and only four hits allowed in seven innings pitched to lead Harvard to a 5-0 victory.
“Laura does an amazing job of keeping us in every single game and gives the offense plenty of time to score,” Gusse said. “I’m never worried when Laura is on the mound.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a bittersweet weekend for the Harvard men’s tennis team. The Crimson extended its winning streak to five this weekend and moved into a tie for second place in the Ivy League after sweeping Brown and Yale.
But No. 19 Columbia finished its perfect 7-0 conference slate and thus clinched the Ivy title with its win over Princeton. The Lions, who last captured the crown in 2010, dropped only one match across its whole Ancient Eight season.
The Lions’ victory means that No. 34 Harvard (16-6, 5-1 Ivy) will fall short in its bid to claim its third-straight Ancient Eight title. While the squad reached the second round of the NCAA Championships the past two seasons, Columbia’s win means that the Crimson must hold out hope for an at-large bid to the tournament this year.
“Congrats to Columbia for going undefeated in Ivies,” junior co-captain Alex Steinroeder said. “That is very tough to do…. It is disappointing not to win [the Ivy League title] again, but our ultimate goal for the year has been to make NCAAs and try to go far there. That goal is still within reach.”
Harvard headed on the road to face the Bears (10-11, 0-6) on Friday before returning to Cambridge to host the Bulldogs (12-9, 1-5) on Sunday afternoon. Although it will not wear this year’s Ivy crown, at 5-1, the Crimson still sits in a tie for second in the conference.
HARVARD 7, YALE 0
Harvard football may have beaten Yale for each of the past seven years, but on Sunday, Harvard tennis defeated the Bulldogs for the 13th straight year. Yale has not won a single match in its last three contests.
The Crimson captured its fifth-straight doubles point on the Murr Center courts. Junior Christo Schultz and freshman Sebastian Beltrame took an 8-5 win, and sophomore Nicky Hu and freshman Brian Yeung finished it off with an 8-4 victory to set the tone early.
From there, three Harvard singles players got early breaks to further extend the Crimson’s streak of good play. Yeung was the first to close it out, making it 2-0 Harvard with a 6-3, 6-2 win. Beltrame was only slightly less efficient in a 6-3, 6-3 victory.
Steinroeder officially clinched it with a 6-3, 6-2 win. Juniors Shaun Chaudhuri and Denis Nguyen along with Hu all finished off their second sets cleanly to give the Crimson the 7-0 victory.
All in all, with seven straight-set triumphs, it was one of the cleanest matches the team has played all season, according to Steinroeder.
“The match against Yale was a very solid, professional performance,” he said. “All the doubles came out on fire and that set the tone for the rest of the afternoon…. That was exactly the match we were looking for.”
HARVARD 4, BROWN 2
On Friday afternoon, the Crimson traveled down to Providence, R.I. to take on the Bears, who have not won a conference matchup this season but who nearly derailed Harvard’s Ivy title hopes last year with a late-season upset over the Crimson at home.
On Friday, Harvard got its revenge, emerging with a 4-2 victory. The Crimson earned its fourth-straight doubles point against Brown. The No. 11 ranked tandem of Nguyen and MacMaster was in control from start to finish, emerging with an 8-6 victory.
Hu and Yeung went down on court two, but Schultz and Beltrame picked up the slack and picked up a few breaks en route to an 8-4 win that gave Harvard the 1-0 advantage.
Steinroeder set the tone early in singles, cruising to a 6-3, 6-1 win. Yeung, who won all four of his matches last weekend, continued his strong Ivy season on Friday. The freshman served his way to victory in a 6-2, 6-3 defeat of Ivan Kravtchenko on the fifth court, giving the Crimson a commanding 3-0 lead.
Despite losses by Chaudhuri and Beltrame, Nguyen, ranked 40th in the country in singles, won his heavyweight battle, 6-4, 6-1, to seal the final margin.
Although the team may be disappointed by not taking first place, it still has had may positive takeaways from its Ivy season, according to Chaudhuri.
“The whole goal was to improve and became a better team overall,” the junior said. “Each of us has evolved to where we are now. Anything short of first is obviously a bit of a letdown, but hats off to Columbia.”
Harvard has one more match in its Ivy season against Dartmouth, with which it is tied for second in the conference. From there, the Crimson must hold out hope that its ranking is high enough to qualify for an at-large berth for the NCAA Championships.
64 teams qualify for the tournament, and after factoring in automatic bids for conference winners, the Crimson will be fighting for a limited number of spots.
“In the past, a top-40 team has been considered safe enough to get an at-large bid,” Chaudhuri explained. “Right now, we’re right on the edge. We have one more match to get through.”

As students have come to appreciate, Dean Donald H. Pfister is a unique man with his own way of doing things. In his honor, Flyby proudly presents the schedule for the first ever Pfister Sunday:
 5:55 a.m.
The good dean wakes up just in time to catch the sunrise over The Charles River, followed by a lovely early morning stroll along along the blossoming river banks.
 6:30 a.m.
Dean Pfister sits down at his desk to prepare for the most important task of his day—sending an email. After long and thoughtful reflection, he decides a subject line of “Thinking about writing a mystery novel that takes place in the Harvard Herbaria…..” will suffice.
 8 a.m.
Now that the email is finally complete and ready to be sent to eagerly awaiting students, Pfister prepares a delicious Easter breakfast. After cooking an omelette with delicious sun-dried tomatoes, fresh arugula, and some special (wink wink) mushrooms, he decides that it is so tasty he will include the recipe in his next email.
9 a.m.
Even though it is a holiday, our dean still has work to get done. Pfister decides to stroll through the Harvard Herbaria, today lingering over the paleobotanical, pollen, and spore collections. After a good long look, the Asa Gray Professor of Systematic Botany sits down at his desk, loving stares at his pet cactus and then begins to work. Today’s project: the medicinal value of baking herbs into cupcakes.
12 p.m.
After putting in some serious work, Pfister is finally ready to celebrate a festive meal with the family. A delicious and all-natural vegetarian meal, napkins made out of leaves of the Ulmus Americana (the Mass. state tree), and a Pfister egg hunt which perfectly follows the plot of “The Signature of All Things,” a classic mystery that Pfister has recommended in multiple emails (and is seriously on my reading list), all round out the celebration.
4 p.m.
Once the crumbs of the delectable cupcake dessert have been cleared, the dean and his family are finally able to relax, hang out, and have some casual conversation. It quickly turns into an earnest discussion of the symbolism in Beatrix Potter’s Peter Rabbit series.
6 p.m.

Visitas—the three days when the lucky 2,023 high school seniors offered admission to Harvard are encouraged to come visit campus—is coming up next weekend. To help prefrosh prepare for this year’s festivities, we’ve put together a list of things to put on or take off of your packing list for this weekend of campus exploration.
Bring: Your Charm
Visitas is an excellent time to socialize (or as we like to call it here at Harvard, network) with your future friends and classmates. As such, you should remember to be witty, insightful, and all-around lovely at all times, lest everybody hate you before you even make it to Camp Harvard in the fall.
Leave Behind: Your Attitude
After four years of being the star of your high school and the apple of every teacher’s eye, you may have an over-heightened sense of your abilities. Here at Harvard, we smell that sentiment like forgotten bagged d-hall lunch that never made it to the refrigerator. Be natural and be yourself. Trust us, everybody here is just as impressive as you may think you are.
Bring: Shower Flip-Flops
Depending on which dorm you are staying in, you may have to utilize a hallway bathroom for the duration of your stay on campus. 95% of the time, they are actually quite decent, as friendly cleaning staff regularly sterilize the bathrooms’ amenities. The other 5% of the time, though (particularly after Friday and Saturday nights like when you will be staying), they can be… interesting…
Leave Behind: Large, unwieldy toiletries
You’re coming for at most three days. If anything you are bringing is over 24 ounces, you should invest travel sized bottle.
Bring: Empty Space in Your Suitcase
Like other regularly scheduled events, you’ll be showered in free things of all shapes and sizes (and varying levels of utility *cough* … think odd-shaped novelty squeeze stress relievers). Plus, you’ll probably want to pick up some swag at the Coop to represent your college when you get back home.
Leave Behind: Books, Sporting Equipment, Musical Instruments
Large, heavy, and unwieldy. These are all words that describe your suitcase on your first trip on the T from Logan Airport to Harvard Square Station. We promise, there will not be much down time once you get here for you to catch up on your AP-whatever class assignments, play tennis, or practice your guitar skills. Leave things that aren’t essential at home
Bring: An Open Mind
Harvard is truly a unique place filled with interesting, diverse people that offers unparalleled opportunities for you to explore. Don’t feel that because you were an all-American athlete in high school you have to be a jock here, or that because you were a mathlete you are destined to concentrate in Statistics. Seize chances to explore new things and make friends with new types of people. You’ll be surprised by how much you grow intellectually, spiritually, and as a person by doing so.
Leave Behind: Any Ideas that You May Have about Harvard
No, we don’t all wear thick glasses (some of us have contacts). No, we don’t spend all of our time on weekends studying (just the weekends before midterms). No, we aren’t all pretentious, know-it-alls (just, well, some of us). When it comes to prospective students weekend, you have to leave behind your expectations and try to determine where you feel that you belong. Make sure that you get your own sense of the vibe of student interaction, the atmosphere of the campus, and the endless wealth of opportunities here for growth. In the end, it is your college experience and nobody else’s.
