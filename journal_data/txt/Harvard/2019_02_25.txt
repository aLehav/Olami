After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the credits roll on Oscar Sunday and this year’s many controversial races are laid to rest, no one will remember who won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. And they certainly will not remember the shorts that lost out on the top trophy. That, simply, is nothing less than a shame.
The animated short is both critically and criminally underrated as an art form. Every scene is not only the product of careful storyboarding and months of skilled animation, but must also advance a compelling narrative that has no more than 20 minutes to unfurl itself. Ranging in tone from absurdist allegorical comedy to deeply felt portraits of family and illness, the animated shorts selected by the Academy this year are a true testament to the creative largesse of the medium. Below, this year’s nominees reviewed.
“Animal Behaviour”
Dir. Alison Snowden and David Fine
“You need to stop gazing at your own navels and just get on with your lives,” an ape says to a text-savvy praying mantis, a boy-crazy leech, a dog with a psychology degree, a bird with a traumatic past and a pig, among other animals. “Animal Behaviour” takes the absurdities of modern human behavior and manifests them in their logical extremes, as character traits of various animals that gather together for a group therapy session. Lorraine the leech has attachment issues, Victor the ape can’t manage his anger, and Jeffrey the bird has nightmares of pushing his little brother out of the nest to his death. The animal stand-ins for human behavior certainly aren’t subtle, but are delightful nonetheless.
Snowden and Fine utilize a muted, familiar animation style, one that evokes the Nickelodeon comics of yesteryear, which adds to the scenes a harsh realism that juxtaposes wonderfully with the antics unfolding on screen. Notably, the short relies heavily on an actual script to advance its concept and develop its characters; none of the other entries in this category come close to this level of hyperactive dialogue, and many have no dialogue at all. But of course, only “Animal Behaviour” has a talking praying mantis. A group of Vancouver-based actors turns in fantastic voice performances — Ryan Beil as the mostly calm, canine psychotherapist is a standout.
The film climaxes in a literal dogfight, as a conventional shrink’s office becomes the animal kingdom writ small. This hilarious twist, though a bit heavy-handed, packs a startling punch. The audience remembers, perhaps with a jolt of discomfort, that they were in the animal kingdom all along.
“One Small Step”
Dir. Andrew Chesworth and Bobby Pontillas
Every little kid dreams of going to space one day, but not as fiercely as Luna Chu, the young girl around whom “One Small Step” revolves. Luna wears moon boots and decorates her room with stars and spaceships. Her father, a loving single parent, supports her dreams, and the two whiz around the house pretending to be astronauts. But, as seems to be a theme in many of these family-oriented shorts, the trials and tribulations of high school and adolescence test the bonds between Luna and her father. The film doesn’t shy away from tragedy in its precious few minutes. But the ending, literally uplifting, resolves Luna’s turmoil in a rich, gorgeously rendered sequence.
The eight-minute film covers at least two decades of Luna’s life, from when she is a young, idealistic dreamer to when she gets the chance to make those dreams come true. For this task, the filmmakers return to a couple of memorable visual motifs that they thread throughout the story. The strongest is a seemingly real sky of stars and moons that are actually Calder-esque pieces hanging from the ceiling, as Luna and her father zip past the objects in their cardboard spaceship like skiers hitting the gates of a slalom course. In this way, “One Small Step” can serve as a textbook example of consolidated storytelling. Every shot, every visual motif, and every pair of shoes that Luna wears has meaning. The film does suffer from predictability — this father-daughter tale is poignant, but not groundbreaking. Accordingly, its ambitious animation occasionally masks some moments of thinness in the story itself. Nevertheless, “One Small Step” is a thoughtful take on a father’s love, a girl’s aspirations, and how the two transcend space and time to care for each other.
“Bao”
Dir. Domee Shi and Becky Neimann-Cobb
“Bao” might have the distinct honor of being the most-viewed Oscar-nominated short film of all time. Pixar’s decision to run “Bao” before every screening of its smash hit “The Incredibles 2” certainly gives the humble baozi dumpling a leg up in terms of popularity. However, “Bao” stands strong all on its own, and is compelling and quietly radical, without any dialogue, as a big-budget portrait of a Chinese-Canadian family.
Rendered in the classic Pixar animation style that has spawned millions of devoted fans and billions of dollars, “Bao” tells the story of a mother who copes with an empty nest by adopting an anthropomorphized homemade bao as her charge. The scenes of the young bao growing up are gorgeously detailed, from the toothbrush that the mother uses to lovingly clean her young bao, to the sweet buns she buys him for a snack, to the punk rock posters that appear on his door during his angsty adolescent years.
Within a few short minutes, the two grow apart, as teenagers and well-meaning parents are wont to do. A short with a plot twist is not rare, but this one is especially good, so no spoilers are forthcoming. All that’s left to say is that “Bao” is a heart wrenching, uplifting, seven-minute story of motherhood, adolescence, family, and delicious food.
“Late Afternoon”
Dir. Louise Bagnall
The year’s most devastating tale of aging and illness comes by way of a minimalist animated short from Ireland. “Late Afternoon” tells a gentle story of Emily, an elderly woman deep in the throes of dementia. A biscuit falling into the abyss of a teacup sends her on an aching mental whirlwind of her life. These scenes of a young and curious Emily are so joyful that the audience might lose itself in the memories, just as she does. The pain is that much sharper, then, when Emily returns to the present and does not remember her caretaker.
The stunning artistry of the animation sets this short apart. “Late Afternoon” looks like a watercolor painting come to life, with fractals of muted color swirling across the screen as the film catapults through time. The character’s faces are sparsely sketched, but with such careful detail that somehow two dots for eyes and a line for a mouth can convey the barely perceptible sadness of Emily’s caretaker as she watches her charge decline. The stunning score is both melancholy and uplifting. And the final moments, between a mother and daughter, are more emotionally affecting than many a skilled actor could ever muster in person. “Late Afternoon” is an absolute must-see.
“Weekends”
Dir. Trevor Jimenez
The notable weekends in this short film are the days in which a young boy with divorced parents gets to see his father. The lovely simplicity of the film’s premise — following its protagonist as he passes from his mother’s house to his father’s house, and back again — is so richly detailed and symbolically evocative that the base narrative ultimately transcends simple description into something much more powerful and ineffable.
In “Weekends,” the characters’ personal spaces speak volumes about their personalities — the effortlessly cool father’s dark, urban bachelor pad in downtown Toronto is decorated with samurai swords, while the warm yet distracted mother’s suburban country rooms are filled with light, but littered with boxes and loose papers. A spatial sketch of the film, perhaps, would allow for the the most apt analysis of the character’s interiorities; it would include the lush tree that changes with the seasons outside of his mother’s house which the boy passes on his way to and from his father’s car every Friday and Sunday. Indeed, “Weekends” is told in geography, through a sumptuous, often surreal mapping of the quiet ties that bind a divided tripartite family. The world surrounding this child of divorce is more hopeful than that of, say, “The Squid and the Whale,” but less saccharine than in “The Parent Trap.” The world of “Weekends” is literally simple — two-dimensional, and anchored by just two spaces — yet poignant, with both the pain and promise of having separated parents etched lovingly into every careful shot.
Jimenez’s animation style, a bit like Claymation but with elegant drawings, lends a slow, hazy feel to each scene. As the film goes on, and the compact unit of two divorced parents and one son starts to expand, Jimenez amplifies its young protagonist’s growing sadness with increasingly dreamlike, escapist visuals. But it is the stunning, almost trippy final shot, full of love and wistfulness, that will stay with you for a while. Animation is rarely so painterly.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the plethora of film lovers the world over, the Academy Awards have become synonymous with artistic excellence. While there are undoubtedly disagreements about who deserves which accolade in any given year, one thing is certain: Nothing cements a filmmaker’s legacy like winning an Oscar statuette. But in a bid to reach a broader audience, the 91st Academy Awards have quickly unravelled into a commercial ratings ploy, rather than a true celebration of artistic achievement, which begs the question: Has the Academy lost touch with what made filmgoing magical in the first place?
In its storied history, the ceremony has become defined by remarkable moments — from Marlon Brando turning down his Best Actor accolade for his now iconic role in "The Godfather" (1972) in protest for misrepresentation of Native Americans in film, to the comedic Roberto Benigni vaulting himself over seats to accept an award. But perhaps more recently, there has been a trend of unforgivable fumbles on the Academy’s behalf. In 2016, there wasn’t a single person of color amongst the twenty nominees in the four acting categories. This was followed up by the dysfunctional breakdown the year after when presenters Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty infamously announced the wrong winner for Best Picture, “La La Land,” before correctly announcing “Moonlight” — only after the “La La Land” crew gathered onstage to accept their award.
This year, however, the Academy has found a way to turn the awards ceremony into a shipwreck before it has even set sail.
Eyebrows rose in August when the Academy announced "Outstanding Achievement in Popular Film" as its newest category. In pandering to a more general audience, the Academy belittled the movies deemed “popular”: Did this new category suggest that movies that strike big on Oscar evening aren’t popular? And does that assumption undermine the point of the Oscars, to introduce great films that people might have otherwise missed? Furthermore, while the Academy never elaborated on what exactly constitutes a “popular” film, Film Academy President John Bailey confirmed that the additional category was meant to boost the show’s steadily falling ratings. However, popularity is in no way mutually exclusive of critical acclaim and artistic merit: Out of the 10 highest grossing films (adjusted for inflation), only one wasn’t nominated for Best Picture (“Snow White and the Seven Dwarves,” which won an honorary Oscar). After facing backlash, the Academy thankfully withdrew this category. The Academy’s dithering would soon unravel into an unfortunate trend where they would introduce unwanted changes, face criticism, and double back on these changes.
On Dec. 4, 2018, the Academy named Kevin Hart as the ceremony host. Controversy emerged when Hart’s past tweets resurfaced with homophobic material, and ultimately, Hart stepped down two days after the announcement. Regardless of what one thinks about the controversial hiring, the ensuing host vacuum has been a fiasco: This year’s ceremony will be the first in 30 years without a host.
Even now — with its disastrous Popular Film category shelved and facing potential calamity with its host-less ceremony — the Academy is still trying to appeal to the commercial audience it so desperately craves. Two weeks before the show is set to air, the Academy announced it would shorten the ceremony by handing out four awards during commercial breaks: “Best Cinematography," “Best Film Editing," “Best Live Action Short Film," and “Best Makeup and Hairstyling." Unsurprisingly, these additions sparked outrage in the film industry. By pulling categories that honor behind-the-scenes artists, who are lifebloods to film production, the Academy denied them the broad exposure they deserve and rarely receive in popular media.
Just looking at films in the running for Best Picture this year, five have been nominated in aforementioned categories. What would “Vice” have been without the makeup that transformed Christian Bale into Dick Cheney reincarnate? What would “The Favourite” or “Roma” have been without their unique cinematic flair? Cinematography is the very heart of what cinema is, so cutting it out of a show that’s meant to highlight achievement in cinema is counterintuitive to say the least. Most people who watch the Oscars won’t know the nominees. Talented movie hairstylists probably aren’t as famous as Leonardo DiCaprio or Meryl Streep. And the live action shorts won’t earn gargantuan box office receipts. But make no mistake — these nominees are absolutely integral to the thriving art of film, and pushing these categories to the wayside speaks to the disconnect between the Academy and the talents it’s meant to reward. On Feb. 15, just four days after, the Academy backtracked again, and will now proceed with televising all listed categories.
Why the Academy continues to make choices that alienate those in the movie industry and their fans is in part a mystery. Undoubtedly, the Academy has acted on an incentive to counteract dwindling viewership, but one has to embrace the complete and complex art of film and not undermine select parts of the industry, particularly the work that takes place behind the camera. The Oscars should be a glamorous showcase of the very best in film. In stealing attention away from the nominees and their accomplishments with their own befuddled managements, the Academy detracts from the magic of cinema.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CAROLINE A. TSAI, 8:02 p.m.: So the 91st Oscars kick off with a performance of a Queen medley by Adam Lambert. The absence of a host is already palpably unpromising, but a “The Beauty of Cinema!” montage matched with a triumvirate of comedy royalty feels like an auspicious start, given the circumstances. “We are not your hosts,” admits Tina Fey, before she, Maya Rudolph, and Amy Poehler launch into a full-scale comedy routine, replete with a photo op and rapid-fire impressions of the nominees. The natural rapport of the SNL alumni definitely feels like a what-could’ve-been moment, in terms of hosts.
Regina King wins Best Supporting Actress. 
CLAIRE N. PARK, 8:12 p.m.: Regina King (“If Beale Street Could Talk”) wins for Best Supporting Actress and gives a deeply touching speech. There’s something missing without the awkward patter of a host in between announcements, but the speeches don’t feel as rushed as they normally do.
CAT, 8:14 p.m.: Brutal smash cut to Amy Adams. Regina King was deserving, to be sure, but when will Amy Adams get her due?
The Best Makeup and Hair Styling and Best Cinematography awards are presented — during the ceremony, not during commercial breaks, as the Academy had controversially announced earlier this month. Best Costume Design and Best Production Design are also presented. 
LUCY WANG, 8:26 p.m.: That sparkly dress! Not a lot of people would pull it off, but [Kate Biscoe, make-up artist and stylist for “Vice”] does.
CAT, 8:29 p.m.: Oh my god. Melissa McCarthy and Brian Tyree Henry’s “The Favourite” homage. The zoom-in on the hand puppet bunny. Who designed these? Can there be a separate award for this? McCarthy rocks the 17th century garb, in her words, “in the subtlest, subtlest of ways.”
KAYLEE S. KIM, 8:33 p.m.: Did I just hear the “Pirates of the Caribbean” theme song? Why?
CNP, 8:37 p.m.: I spoke too soon! The winners for Best Makeup and Hairstyling were ushered off stage when their speech went on for too long.
CET, 8:39 p.m.: Is it weird that the stage design is kind of in the shape of Donald Trump’s hair? I’m kind of triggered, but…I guess I’ll allow it.
CNP, 8:40 p.m.: Hannah Beachler, wearing a stunning, fittingly architectural red dress, accepts her Oscar for Best Production Design. She’s the first African American to win in this category!
CAT, 8:44 p.m.: Tyler Perry, presenting Best Cinematography, shades the Academy for initially putting the production awards during the commercial breaks. Yikes.
KSK, 8:45 p.m.: Well-deserved shade.
Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga share an intimate moment. Alfonso Cuarón wins the first of several awards. 
CAT, 9:02 p.m.: I wonder how Bradley Cooper’s wife feels about Lady Gaga.
ETHAN B. REICHSMAN, 9:02 p.m.: Well, you know what they say. There’s 100 people in a room, and 99 don’t believe in you, but one does, and he happens to be Bradley Cooper.
EBR 9:07: Can’t wait to be sick of Alfonso Cuarón talking tonight.
KSK, 9:08: Someone needs to stop Ethan from talking to himself.
Bette Midler performs “The Place Where Lost Things Go,” from “Mary Poppins.” 
EDWARD M. LITWIN, 9:09 p.m.: [CAT: Can I add you to the live blog? Give me a sound bite.] What sound bite do you want? [EBR: That’s perfect. Bye, Edward.]
KSK, 9:10 p.m.: [Bette Midler singing] Who is THAT?
CNP, 9:12 p.m.: Bette Midler! Cosmo Kramer, where you at?
“Bohemian Rhapsody” wins Best Film Editing. Daniel Craig presents an award, as well as Pharrell Williams. 
EBR, 9:20 p.m.: Giving Film Editing to “Bohemian Rhapsody” is a way for the Academy to flip off Bryan Singer.
CAT, 9:21 p.m.: [Daniel Craig onstage] Look, it’s Rachel Weisz’s husband!
NOAH F. HOUGHTON, 9:31 p.m.: Where is Pharrell’s hat?
EBR, 9:34: Oh, Mahershala borrowed it.
“Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” wins Best Animated Feature. 
CNP, 9:31 p.m.: “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” just won Best Animated Feature! It’s been a critic favorite and a universal crowd-pleaser, but this was such a stacked category. “Isle of Dogs,” “Incredibles 2,” and “Ralph Breaks the Internet” were amazing and inventive in their own ways, so I’m glad someone had to make this choice for me.
CAT, 9:33 p.m.: Michelle Yeoh — and literally everyone else — predicted this win!
John Mulaney and Awkwafina present the Oscars for shorts. 
EBR, 9:43 p.m.: JOHN MULANEY AND AWKWAFINA? This is the best pair ever.
CAT, 9:44 p.m.: Awkwafina jokes about being nervous to see Spike Lee. Cue a brutal smash cut to Spike Lee.
CAT, 9:46 p.m.: “Bao” wins Best Animated Short. It’s heartening to see two women accepting statuettes on stage, in a ceremony where so many nominations skew male — especially for such a touching short. Go, Domee Shi!
The Crimson Arts staff comments on acceptance speeches. 
LW, 9:48 p.m.: I don’t really like this acceptance speech.
EBR, 9:48 p.m.: Can we review the acceptance speeches? “Didn’t thank me. 0/10.”
CAT, 9:56 p.m.: [quoting Diego Luna, introducing “Roma”] “This is a story of lonely women and absent men.” Story of my life.
EBR, 9:56 p.m.: Caroline… Should we turn off the ceremony and just talk for a while?
Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga perform an intimate duet of “Shallow,” from “A Star Is Born.” 
EVERYONE, 10:00 p.m.: [Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga start performing “Shallow”] OH, HELL YEAH.
ALLISON J. SCHARMANN, 10:02 p.m.: I wanna respond to whoever asked how Bradley Cooper’s wife is feeling: not good.
EBR, 10:05 p.m.: If there are 100 people in a room, and you have sexual tension with only one of them, it happens to be Bradley Cooper.
“Green Book” wins Best Original Screenplay, while Spike Lee wins Best Adapted Screenplay for “BlacKkKlansman.” 
EBR, 10:12 p.m.: The [redacted] “Green Book” beat the [redacted] “Favourite.”
EBR, 10:15 p.m.: Regardless of whether it’s good, “BlacKkKlansman” is gonna win. They generally give screenplay awards to directors who can’t win Best Director because their movies are too political or controversial or good.
CET, 10:18 p.m.: [Spike Lee wins Best Adapted Screenplay] I want him to crowdsurf now.
Rami Malek wins Best Actor for "Bohemian Rhapsody" and Olivia Colman wins Best Actress for "The Favourite."
CAT, 10:46 p.m.: Rami Malek wins Best Actor. He was the favorite of this award season, so this is pretty expected.
ASJ, 10:49 p.m.: He’s like one of those theater kids you date in college because he’s so into the art. And then it all goes wrong.
EBR, 10:58 p.m.: Olivia Colman is so good, and has been for decades. She’s a national treasure. Wrong country, but a national treasure.
EBR, 11:00 p.m.: [Olivia Colman wins] YES! She is a delight! My heart is so happy.
CAT, 11:07 p.m.: [after Olivia Colman’s acceptance speech] I just want the record to indicate that Caroline Tew is fully crying right now.
CAT, 11:10 p.m.: How has Alfonso Cuarón not run out of stuff to say at this point?
And finally, Best Picture is presented to “Green Book.” 
MILA GAUVIN II, 11:15 p.m.: [“Green Book” wins] I’m… actually grossed out.
EBR, 11:15 p.m.: I demand that the Oscars producers cut to Spike Lee during this travesty of an acceptance speech.
KSK, 11:15 p.m.: Oh, Spike Lee better get up on that stage and protest.
EBR, 11:30 p.m.: All I can hang on to to stave off depression is Olivia Colman continuing her long streak of being a treasure.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We’re tired. We’re busy with classes, homework, and extracurriculars. But we still took the witness stand in the federal Harvard admissions trial on Oct. 29, doing something that most college students have only seen in television shows. We spent countless hours preparing with lawyers, talking to media, and organizing our peers to rally and march because we ardently believe in the importance of educational justice and accessible higher education for students of all backgrounds.
But while it is imperative to defend diversity in admissions, it is not enough to worry about who the school admits. Harvard must also ensure that all students are supported and well-equipped to thrive once they arrive on campus.
We asked the judge for the chance to testify in order to, as Harvard characterized it, "offer important and distinctive perspectives on the importance of a racially diverse student body.” Before the court, and the world, we revealed our academic records, family histories, and our aspirations. On legal record, we also re-lived and publicly shared the personal moments in which our university systematically failed us. It is hard to continually fight for and defend our existence at an institution that wasn’t built for us, as evidenced by the lack of a culturally nuanced and competent support network or even a physical manifestation of our presence on campus. Students and alumni have been making the same demands for years. We are tired of having to fight to belong on this campus. If administrators are truly listening, then they know that action is long overdue and students are prepared to hold them accountable.
We demand a robust and interdisciplinary Ethnic Studies Department. Harvard has failed, for the past 47 years, to equip students with the language and skills needed to grapple with the critical issues of race and ethnicity of our time, including affirmative action. We need tenured faculty and course offerings in Native American and Indigenous Studies, Latinx Studies, Asian American Studies, Arab and Muslim American Studies, and Comparative Race and Ethnic Studies to address the challenges in our communities both at Harvard and beyond.
We demand staff and faculty that value and represent the diversity of the Harvard student body. While University representatives do not necessarily bear ill intent, the number of racially insensitive incidents recounted by students during the course of the trial demonstrates the necessity of mandatory sensitivity and bias trainings for all University employees, including mental health counselors, campus officers, admissions officers, and teaching staff. Harvard’s dedication to diversity should also extend to its recruitment and retention of faculty and staff of color.
We demand accessible spaces that validate and address the needs of marginalized students. The call for a stable, visible, and funded multicultural center has existed for decades. The same accommodations need to be extended to and expanded for the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, the Women’s Center, and the many student-run mental health services that currently occupy basement spaces. The history of this campus is physically and symbolically coded with privilege. We need funding and administrative support for affinity groups and spaces in order to begin to shift the tide.
We demand more opportunities for students to engage in meaningful public service that aims to not only champion and develop student leadership but also to address community needs. Harvard must uphold and expand a model of service that is community-based and student-led, with increased funding and resources for students committed to meaningful and long-term community engagement. In doing so, Harvard can support work aimed at dismantling the oppressive structures that hinder equal educational accessibility for communities of color and that prevent student success across the board.
Institutions of higher education across the nation must better support marginalized students. We hope that Harvard will serve as an example in addressing students’ needs and ensuring that all students succeed. “I’m still confident that we will win in the trial court,” University President Lawrence S. Bacow said, but for the students who have been working overtime to fill the holes themselves in the University's support system, this is not enough. It has never been enough. Harvard claims that it is committed to ensuring each admitted class reflects the diversity of the world we inhabit and create. Now, the administration must proactively work towards ensuring that the campus truly reflects this principle of inclusion and belonging.
Harvard may win this lawsuit, but Harvard is nothing without its students. Harvard cannot successfully “educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society” unless all students are adequately supported to thrive and succeed in ways that are personally meaningful to them.
Administrators, you have our demands. You know what we need. Do something about it.
Sally Chen ‘19, a joint concentrator in History & Literature and Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality, lives in Winthrop House. Thang Q. Diep ‘19, a Neuroscience concentrator, lives in Dunster House. Catherine H. Ho ‘21, a Neuroscience concentrator, lives in Leverett House.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a welcome turn of events, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences recently announced a 3 percent increase in the stipend for Ph.D. students on financial aid for the 2019-2020 academic year. Graduate students often face considerable economic struggles in light of the ever-increasing cost of living in the greater Cambridge-Boston area. We greatly support the stipend increase, as it will serve to combat these difficulties and promote the financial accessibility of graduate programs.
We have previously opined that Harvard should do more to help graduate students and work to improve their quality of life. This is a step in the right direction in doing so. Their dual role as both students and instructors — many work as teaching fellows for undergraduate courses across the Faculty of Arts and Sciences — places them at the heart of what makes Harvard run. The University should work to ensure that their quality of life mirrors their importance.
While the increase does represent tangible progress towards that goal, it does not mean that Ph.D. students’ economic troubles are solved. While the value of the stipend changes from year to year, these changes are not always so generous. Last academic year, GSAS also instituted a 3 percent increase, but the prior year only brought a 1.5 percent increase. Given that rent and food costs across the greater Boston area have risen in the last few years, unpredictable increases in the stipend expose graduate students to the risk that those increases will not keep pace with those in the cost of living. As a result, we are concerned that the University is not providing adequate resources for graduate students to thrive at Harvard, especially if they live near campus. Harvard Square and surrounding areas have only become more expensive and inaccessible to residents and students alike in the last few years, and it appears they will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. The University’s treatment of students reflects its values as an educational institution, and must work persistently to ensure that graduate students enjoy a decent standard of living.
In order to consistently provide for the needs of GSAS students, we recommend that GSAS index Ph.D. stipends to the cost of living in the greater Cambridge-Boston area, as the cost of living near Harvard will likely rise. Given that GSAS students often live in and face difficulties affording off-campus housing, concerns over the financial stability of graduate students will continue to surface unless actions like indexing are taken.
We appreciate Harvard’s commitment to providing an accessible education for all of its students, as the stipend program shows. But certain career paths necessitate graduate degrees, such as in academia or advanced research in certain fields, and the high financial costs of such degrees may dissuade or discourage many prospective talented undergraduate students from pursuing said careers. If these undergraduates do not see adequate systems of support, the chances they will pursue these careers would be lower.
Thus, in the spirit of ensuring its education is as accessible as possible, attracting and assisting the best minds across the country and the world, we call on Harvard to reaffirm its commitment to making graduate school affordable and accessible for as many students as it can — starting with this stipend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past August, I was involved in the First-Year Urban Program, as I have been for the past three years. As the leaders prepared for the “FUPpies” to arrive on campus, we had a slot for “leader family” bonding in small groups.
To get to know each other better, we were supposed to do “life mapping.” We drew diagrams for critical moments in our lives (up to that point) that we were going to share at the end. We shared stories that consisted of a lot of pain, but my friend, who I had known for years, and I laughed together at experiences we had shared in a way that was probably confusing to the other people in our group who didn’t know us well.
“Oh, no. I was definitely crying and yelling when that happened in real life,” my friend acknowledged after we were all done.
“Of course. Me too. I think it just gets easier when you practice this so much,” I agreed.
I’ve been praised for so long for my strength. I’ve been praised for the countless times I’ve gotten up after falling down. I surprise myself when I no longer cry about experiences that once caused me so much pain. When I can bring them up casually in conversation.
As people in marginalized communities, we learn to laugh off our oppressions and lived struggles as a way of coping with the pain. This is how we form communities. We do this for a reason, though it seems to happen naturally. We make jokes with people of similar identities that don’t work the same with outsiders. It becomes a break from the tension and serious conversations we usually see around these sensitive topics.
We have become submerged in identity politics and out of it comes the expectation to speak on behalf of the communities we belong to. We are taught that we need people to sympathize, and the onus is on us to make sure our words carry meaning. But we can’t do that well if we are shaking and crying on a panel or news interview. I’ve realized how much this pattern manifests itself in the world we live in now, as it demands that we present our pain in a way that is palatable.
With the “life mapping” activity came the realization of how much we can become desensitized to our own pain through these efforts of standing up for ourselves. In a previous article, I mentioned how sharing my story around my immigration status helped me to let go of some of the pain each time. I attribute this mostly to my status because that is the story I get asked for the most.
I saw this pattern clearly ingrained in the immigration system itself when I worked with women seeking asylum this past summer. I ran through their declarations with them to make sure we were making a strong-enough claim to prove that they had a credible fear of returning to their home countries. The U.S. demanded that they spill their trauma, mostly cases of sexual assault and gang violence, into the organized structure of a legal case file. Extremely counterintuitively, they had to relive their pain in order to get a semblance of peace through an asylum that was not guaranteed.
These cases then go to immigration courts, where their stories are read by immigration judges who are no longer surprised by the words they’ve seen before them many times. That’s when you notice that it is not only us who grow numb to our own pain, but also people looking in.
People are put on display to be viewed by members of their own communities as well as outsiders. We see news covering recent attacks on our own communities and it no longer surprises us. Outsiders see the news and they no longer care, if they ever did at all. Stories of violence and injustice become the norm as they flood our feed. We see news of school shootings, police violence, and sexual assault, and we are no longer outraged.
But if we are becoming desensitized to our own pain, what could that mean for outsiders in their ease of ignoring it and even perpetuating it? What does this mean for us when we only have enough energy to concern ourselves with how to deal with the pain and not with where it is coming from?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard School of Public Health security guard Joseph G. Bartuah filed a complaint with the Massachusetts State Attorney General’s Office earlier this month, alleging his supervisors at Securitas Security Services North America, which provides security services for the University, retaliated against him after he raised workplace concerns to them.
On Feb. 5, Bartuah wrote an email to his supervisors, Takeyon J. Moon and Ryan Pitt to raise concerns. Bartuah heard from coworkers that Pitt told them that Bartuah had failed to “respond to phone calls from the management,” according to emails Bartuah provided. In his email to his supervisors, Bartuah told the managers that those remarks were “uncalled, unprofessional” and would damage his reputation among his superiors and colleagues.
Bartauh said that three days later, he received a call from Alonzo B. Herring, Boston area manager of Securitas North America, telling him not to come to work due to an investigation. In an “investigative meeting,” Bartuah said members of Securitas management showed him surveillance footage in which he was away from his desk during overnight shifts.
Bartuah said in an interview that he has left his post during his shifts, but that this is a “common practice” for security guards working overnight, and no other employees are facing discipline.
“That is because of the overnight culture that we create in the workplace,” Bartuah said. “During the time of the night where everybody’s sleeping, things are pretty loose, so we don’t operate like we operate during the day.”
“I think this investigation started out of retaliation, that's my position,” Bartuah added.
Securitas and Pitt did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Moon declined to comment on Bartuah’s complaint.
“It would be completely inappropriate for us to comment on an on-going employment matter between Securitas and our employee,” Herring wrote in an email.
Shortly after the “investigative meeting,” Bartuah filed a workplace complaint with the State Attorney General’s Office. Margaret Quackenbush, the office’s spokesperson, confirmed the existence of the complaint.
The investigation has left Bartuah in a difficult financial position, he said.
“I’m not getting paid. I don’t know if I could move on,” Bartuah said. “Bills are creeping up as well as the rent at the end of the month.” Bartuah said he has not been paid for two weeks.
In addition to working as a guard at the School of Public Health, Bartuah is a student at the Division of Continuing Education at the Harvard Extension School. After this semester, he said he will only have one semester remaining to complete a Master’s degree in Government.
If he were to be terminated, Bartuah said, he would not be able to register for his final semester. The company has yet to provide him a timeline regarding how long the investigation will last, he said.
“I've gotten myself just trying to focus on my education and trying to look for different opportunities when the investigation ends,” he said. “I think the main reason why I'm even doing this is because I need a new job to complete my degree at the Extension School.”
Bartuah is in contact with his union, 32BJ Service Employees International Union, and Harvard Student Labor Action Movement regarding his case.
“We take allegations of unjust termination seriously and follow a strict protocol to process any grievance accordingly,” 32BJ SEIU spokesperson Amanda Torres-Price wrote in an emailed statement.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that the University could not comment on the case because Bartuah is employed by Securitas, a contracted firm.
“This matter does not involve employees of the University, and with that the University is not in a position to comment,” Swain wrote. “Additionally, it is the University’s practice to not comment on personnel matters.”
SLAM distributed flyers about Bartuah’s case over Harvard email lists and called for students to contact University Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran regarding Bartuah’s case, according to SLAM organizer Ria Modak ’22.
SLAM is also lobbying the Undergraduate Council to release a “statement of solidarity” for Bartuah, similar to how they supported former University Health Services employee Mayli Shing, who activists have argued was fired from her position as retaliation.
“I think that we've had success in this kind of individual advocacy efforts like Mayli,” Modak said. “Joseph's case points to instances of retaliation that happen in the workplace that are completely unacceptable.”
“In an ideal world, Joseph would be rehired to his old post and with back pay,” Modak said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During a reflection event Saturday evening, Muslim students looked back on their journey — both spiritual and physical — to Saudi Arabia over winter break as a part of Harvard’s inaugural Umrah trip.
For many, the January trip was not only their first time on Umrah — an Islamic pilgrimage — but also their first time outside of the United States. Nearly all of the students were fully funded by community organizations and anonymous alumni donors to participate in the trip.
Khalil Abdur-Rashid, Harvard’s first full-time Muslim chaplain, hosted Saturday's event — which included dinner and a reflection period. With his wife, Ustadha Samia Omar, Abdur-Rashid led the group of 30 students. They split the eight day trip between the Saudi Arabian cities of Mecca and Medina.
Abdur-Rashid said the evening was one meant for “sharing, exploration, and reminiscence about the journey” students took last month.
Umrah is considered the “minor pilgrimage” in Islamic practice in contrast with Hajj, which is the “major pilgrimage” and falls on specific dates each year according to the lunar calendar. The rites and duties performed during each are similar, but Umrah can be performed anytime during the year and is typically simpler and shorter, according to Abdur-Rashid.
Several students said they were extremely grateful for the opportunity to perform Umrah and recounted stories of spiritual growth and transformation while overseas.
“This was a profound experience and that’s to say the least,” Jenna Albezreh ’22 said. “I don’t think that’s something you can get here at Harvard or any university campus in the world.”
Many students said that going from being a religious minority as a Muslim in America to a part of the majority while on the trip helped put their faith in perspective.
“It was a cultural shock,” Injil Muhammad ’21 said of his first trip to Asia as part of Umrah. “So many people — 300 people to my right and left praying — made me feel like I was in the right place. I was home.”
Others said that being in Mecca and Medina moved them to think about their religion beyond their own personal practice.
For Abdelaziz “Zizo” Bahnasey ’21, Umrah drew his attention to the “millions of Muslims who have done this before you, will do this after you.”
“I have always been the center of my life and that is something I have come to realize.” he said.
Abdur-Rashid said he and his wife plan to make Harvard Umrah an annual trip with the hope of allowing all students in the future to attend without having to pay.
“This trip should be part and parcel of every single student that wants to go’s experience,” Abdur-Rashid said.

The Undergraduate Council unanimously voted Sunday to allocate $4000 to fund an event for juniors whose families will not be able to attend Junior Family Weekend.
The event will be a three-course lunch on March 2. Amanda Claybaugh and Sindhumathi Revuluri, the dean and associate dean of undergraduate education respectively, will attend the lunch. Professors from several departments, including History of Science, Psychology, and Romance Languages and Literatures, will also be present.
UC President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20, Vice President Julia M. Huesa ’20, and Winthrop House Representative Shivani R. Aggarwal ’21 proposed the event.
“Both junior and sophomore class-wide programming has traditionally lacked on campus, so this event in particular strives to accomplish that amongst a demographic of students who might not also have that support when a bunch of other students are here with their parents,” Palaniappan said.
The team predicts roughly 50 students will attend the event, as well as 20 faculty members. They said they hope the event will give juniors an opportunity to reflect on their futures while faculty members serve as mentors.
“Having this [lunch] gives them the ability to also talk about more broad questions of what it means to be a student on this campus and how to think about your last year and a half and even future plans,” Palaniappan said.
“There’s lots of interest from faculty members to engage in this particular type of event as well, so I think it gives them the opportunity to gain insight as to where juniors are mentally in terms of their time here at Harvard and how they can also support them when it comes to their time in the classroom together,” Palaniappan added.
The lunch was inspired by a similar event for freshmen whose parents could not attend First-Year Family Weekend.
“Currently, there isn’t an alternative event for juniors whose families aren’t able to come to Junior Family Weekend, as there was for first-years,” Huesa said. “We wanted there to be an opportunity for something like that for juniors.”
Mai-Linh Ton ’19, the organizer of the freshman dinner, said she created the event two years ago to make Harvard more inclusive and have faculty “take the place” of parents who could not be in Cambridge that particular weekend.
“I think the junior parents weekend is a perfect continuation because that’s something I had in mind, too,” Ton said. “I'm so happy that the UC ended up doing the other half.”
The team asked the Office of Diversity Education and Support to institutionalize and help fund the event, but since the office had already planned its budget for the year, it could not accommodate an additional event, according to Palaniappan. She said, however, that the office may be able to sponsor the event in future years.

The Broad Institute announced plans to launch the Gerstner Center for Cancer Diagnostics after receiving a total endowment of $25 million, according to a Tuesday press release.
The Broad Institute — run jointly by Harvard and MIT — aims to understand “molecular components of life and their connections” with the ultimate goal of improving medicine, disease diagnostics, and treatment. The new center will work toward developing a new method of cancer diagnosis and treatment using blood samples.
Scientists at the Gerstner Center plan to focus their research on blood-based biopsies, a less invasive approach than current CT and MRI scans, in order to assess patient treatment responses, according to the press release.
Viktor A. Adalsteinsson, associate director of the Gerstner Center, said in the release that new blood biopsy technology will allow for better tracking of tumor growth and composition.
“Using blood biopsy to track patient response will help us not only determine if a tumor has gotten smaller, something imaging technologies already do, but will help us understand what is happening to the molecular composition of the tumor, something you can’t do with a CT scan or MRI,” Adalsteinsson said.
The blood biopsy method simplifies cancer cell study, allowing researchers to simply draw blood to obtain cell DNA. The press release notes that cancer cells release DNA fragments into the bloodstream that can be collected and analyzed to monitor cancer recurrence and responsiveness to treatment.
Todd R. Golub, director of the cancer program and Gerstner Center, said he was surprised by the simplicity and effectiveness of blood biopsies in improving cancer treatment.
“Not long ago I thought that blood biopsy was more science fiction than reality,” he said in the release. “Broad scientists have demonstrated that it’s possible to look at an entire cancer genome from a blood biopsy. That is spectacular.”
Broad Institute President Eric S. Lander said he is optimistic that blood biopsies will greatly advance the scientific understanding of cancer and, consequently, patient care.
“We have the opportunity now to greatly improve patient care,” he said in the release. “We can move closer toward making blood biopsy and other diagnostic technologies for tracking disease progression a powerful new standard-of-care for patients.”
Correction: Feb. 28, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly referred to the Gerstner Center as the Gerstner Center of Cancer. In fact, the title of the center is the Gerstner Center for Cancer Diagnostics.

CNN journalist Don C. Lemon addressed the intersections of race, media, and politics at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics Friday evening.
In a conversation with IOP Spring Resident Fellow Aisha Moodie-Mills and former Harvard Political Review president Sam Kessler ’19, Lemon discussed how his personal background has created a certain set of expectations for his work.
“I’m black and I’m gay,” Lemon said. “Black folks have a certain expectation of me; many feel that I should represent all black people. Same thing with gay people.”
He said that while journalists can draw from their experiences when reporting, they should not allow their personal identity to bias their reporting.
“We all have different lenses. There’s nothing wrong with having a perspective on things, as long as you don’t let that carry or obscure your thinking or what you do,” Lemon said.
Additionally, Lemon said other people’s discriminatory attitudes toward reporters’ backgrounds can color the public’s criticism of their work. He said this causes him to always “wonder” how his audience perceives him.
Though some people’s criticisms of his work may be justified, Lemon said he believes biases underlie some people's criticisms of him.
“A lot of the criticism of me is warranted,” he said. “Other times I think it’s based in homophobia — a lot of it — I think a lot of it is also based in racism.”
Lemon has not just had to contend with the public’s opinions: Some backlash to his reporting has come from President Donald Trump. Trump called Lemon “the dumbest man on television” in a tweet last August after Lemon’s interview with basketball player Lebron James aired on CNN.
Lemon said he believes the president’s negative comments about CNN and his reporting in particular are rooted in Trump's alleged opposition to the truth.
“He hates it because we tell the truth, and the truth doesn’t fit into his agenda,” Lemon said.
But even as Lemon believes Trump appears to hate the media, he said Trump also depends on it.
“He loves the media,” Lemon said. “Without the media there would be no Donald Trump.”
Despite Trump’s opposition to news sources like CNN, Lemon argued that this particular issue is only temporary.
“The presidency comes with term limits. Journalism does not,” Lemon said. “Long after this administration is in power there will be journalism, so take some solace in that.”

Harvard has joined an “Action Collaborative” that will perform further research on sexual harassment in academia in response to a report on sexual harassment from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.
The collaborative — which was established under the National Academies — is comprised of a group of universities who plan to work together to study gender-based harassment in the sciences. The list of participating universities is not yet finalized, but Harvard is one of the collaborative’s 28 founding members.
The project will last at least four years, and the group will hold two meetings annually, according to Deputy Provost Margaret E. Newell who will serve as one of Harvard’s representatives in the collaborative.
Over that period, the collaborative aims to achieve four main goals: raise awareness about sexual harassment, share “evidence-based institutional policies,” set a research agenda, and create a standardized method for measuring progress.
Dr. Frazier Benya, the National Academies staff member in charge of the collaborative and study director for the 2018 report entitled “Sexual Harassment of Women,” wrote in an email that the inspiration for the collaborative came from discussions with universities about the report.
“They often asked what ideas and strategies other institutions were pursuing to follow the recommendations in our report and they wondered what those institutions had found was working,” she wrote.
The National Academies have formed action collaboratives about other issues in the past, which Frazier said inspired the idea to use the model to address sexual misconduct in academia.
“It seemed clear that this model would work well for assisting institutions with sharing their new ideas and promising practices,” she wrote.
“There’s always the danger, I think, that with these large-scale reports, that they’ll end up just kind of sitting on a shelf,” said Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay about the Academies’ report in an interview earlier this month. “But the fact that this is the first big step post-report, and it’s one that by its very title is committed to making a difference, is really encouraging.”
Harvard reached out to the collaborative shortly after the report was published, according to Newell. Both she and University Title IX Officer Nicole M. Merhill will be involved in the collaborative in the coming months.
The group will conduct its research via four different working groups, each with a different focus. Newell said the working groups will research topics like best practices for helping victims of sexual harassment and ideas for restructuring policies to decrease misconduct.
In March, representatives from the founding members of the collaborative, including Newell, will meet to concretely determine what each working group will research.
“The Action Collaborative is intended to pick up from where that report leaves off, and to engage universities together, collectively, to try to address some of those issues and concerns,” Newell said. “They also want to do it in a way that’s evidence-based.”
Though the collaborative is a research initiative and not a policy program, Merhill and Newell both said they hope policy changes will result from its findings.
“One area that you might see some movement on, through conversations as a result of the National Academies’ report, is what is called ‘gray areas’ of misconduct,” Merhill said.
She added that there may be an opportunity for the collaborative to discuss how to develop a policy that addresses these gray areas, which are typically understood as incidents of misconduct that do not fall under the specific standards for sexual harassment.
In addition to discussing the collaborative’s potential to influence policy, Newell also referenced its applicability to disciplines beyond the sciences.
“There are many things that they can say generally, that you don’t have to be a scientist for them to apply to you,” she said. “It just happens to be the National Academies that’s spearheading this — but that doesn’t mean that they, either, want it to be limited to those disciplines.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Five ties and two lead changes, but it was one minute and 26 seconds that made all of the difference.
At the end of a back and forth affair, Harvard (0-2, 0-0 Ivy League) fell by a score of 12-9 to UMass (1-2) at Jordan Field on Saturday. The Crimson will now have to wait until its next time out to try to pick up their first win of the season.
A week after a tough loss against the ranked North Carolina Tar Heels, the Crimson came into its second game ready to take on its in-state rival, the University of Massachusetts. Despite being 0-2, UMass looked solid in its games, falling in a close 12-11 overtime battle to Army in its season opener, as well as in an 11-7 defeat at the hands of No. 13 Ohio State. With both teams chomping at the bit to prove themselves and pick up their first win of the 2019 season, the stage was set for Harvard’s home opener to be an intense battle.
Neither the chilly 40 ˚F temperature nor the early 1:00 pm faceoff deterred fans from attending the big game. In addition to the ticket line that stretched all the way back to Harvard Stadium, the entire bleachers were full and the range of standing spectators spanned across the entire East end of the field. Finally, with both teams warmed up, the game got underway, and would not disappoint.
The Crimson pushed the tempo early, as the team launched four shots within the opening minutes of the game. Finally, Harvard was able to break through when sophomore defenseman Frankie Tangredi scored off of a UMass turnover. Despite the quick start by the Crimson, UMass remained unfazed, and two minutes later, sophomore attackman Chris Connolly netted a tying goal. With the game back to being even, each side stepped up the aggressiveness in an attempt to go out ahead.
After UMass junior midfielder Charlie O’Brien was penalized for holding, Harvard was given the edge and made sure to take advantage. 25 seconds into the 30-second penalty, reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Week Austin Madronic, an attackman for the Crimson, stormed through to net his fourth goal of the season. With the momentum back with Harvard, the team continued to force the pressure, and by the time the buzzer sounded that signaled the end of the first quarter, junior midfielder Nigel Andrews and junior attackman Kyle Anderson each added a goal to give the Crimson a 4-1 lead.
At the start of the second quarter, many of the 1,233 fans in attendance were still pouring into the stadium. UMass was determined not to give in, and, after winning the opening faceoff, the team marched downfield and launched shot after shot. Great physical defense by senior defenseman Jonathan Butler, combined with excellent goalkeeping from sophomore Kyle Mullin, allowed the Crimson to hold off the initial attacks.
However, UMass remained relentless, and soon enough, Conolly led a quick counter-attack and put one through for UMass. In the following five minutes, UMass launched six shots, all of which Mullin was able to save. Although senior defenseman Issac Paparo and junior midfielder Jeff Trainor led a majority of the UMass attack, it was sophomore midfielder Kevin Tobin that ripped a deep shot that nearly got by Mullin to make it a one-goal game halfway through the second quarter.
After a goal from Trainor shortly after, UMass found itself in a tie game, but appeared to change up its playing style. In a surprising move, the team switched off its fast-paced play and tried to slow the game down in an attempt to gain the lead. However, the tactic did not work out, and on a quick turnaround, freshman defenceman Chase Strupp set up Madronic for a much-needed goal that gave Harvard the lead. Harvard was still unable to break away, as, after a continual back-and-forth battle in which each team netted another goal, UMass found itself down only 6-5 at halftime.
UMass looked to up the pressure at the beginning of the second half, yet Mullin continued his stellar play and fended off shots by Trainor and freshman attackman Scott Del Zotto. After the game, Butler had high praise for Mullin, saying “Kyle Mullin was great for us in goal again, but we can’t rely on him to continue making big saves for us.” The rest of the team would have to step up.
Five minutes into the third, a cutting Madronic attempted a behind-the-head shot that UMass senior goalie Sean Sconone was barely able to knock away for one of his 13 saves on the day. Although momentum seemed to be building with Harvard once again, UMass quickly turned things around, and, after a beautiful minute-long penalty kill in which Harvard could not get a shot off, freshman midfielder Gabriel Procyk stormed down the field and re-tied the game.
During an offensive possession, a pass from junior attackman Ryan Graff flew just above the stick of Anderson, who turned into an absolutely brutal hit by Paparo. Madronic, taking exception to a cheap hit on his teammate, flew over to have some words in the face of Paparo, which caused the teams to have a little skirmish on the UMass end of the field. Although it took several minutes for the referees to sort things out, the play resulted in Madronic, as well as two UMass players, each receiving a minute long penalty.
35 seconds into the penalty kill, Anderson got his revenge, and off an assist from sophomore attackman Myles Hamm, scored the go-ahead goal for Harvard. Unfortunately, this was not enough to break the pattern of the game, as once again, UMass was able to strike back. This time, it was Trainor who fought his way in from the left wing to tie it up. Both teams fought to try to gain an advantage in the final minute of the third, but as the quarter came to a close, the score remained 7-7.
The game was set for a dramatic finish that would come down to the wire. Fans from each side were cheering as loud as they could for their teams, each trying to outdo the other. Tensions ran high and could be felt through the air as the players made their way back onto the field, preparing for the battle that would determine the final result.
It did not take long for the action to pick up right where it had left off. Seven seconds into the quarter, Paparo picked up a two-minute unnecessary roughness penalty for a hit on Cuccurullo as the two fought for the faceoff. Harvard, smelling blood, knew it had to capitalize during this time. 40 seconds into the penalty kill, Graff found Hamm who ripped a go-ahead goal for the Crimson. However, with 11:27 left in the game, Paparo got out on a breakaway and beat Mullin to the top left corner, tying the game for a fifth time.
Harvard continued to push and hold off counter attacks, looking for any attempt that would allow for some breathing room. However, a momentary lack of focus resulted in a major disadvantage for the Crimson. UMass had not led for a single second of the game, but in a span of one minute and 26 seconds, Del Zotto and Connolly scored three goals. With 5:30 left, Harvard now found itself down by three goals. The turnaround was incredibly quick and left the Crimson fans in a stunned silence.
Harvard fought until the bitter end, but it simply was not enough to overcome the three-goal deficit. Hamm was able to notch one more goal for the Crimson, but a late, open-goal score by UMass with 17 seconds left, put the game away for good.
“That was a tough one to lose because of the rivalry we’ve developed over the years against UMass, but the good news is we have another game at Holy Cross on Tuesday and we’re hoping to start taking our season in the right direction,” Anderson said.
Although the final score was 12-9, the game felt far closer throughout its entirety. Despite the hard loss, the team is keeping its head up and focusing on rebounding for a great year.
Butler also stressed the importance of consistency moving forward.
“I thought we played really hard through the first three quarters and just didn’t make some key plays in the fourth quarter” Butler said. “We still feel very confident in our team’s ability to execute better in our next couple of games against Holy Cross and Hartford.”

Harvard finished its matches with an even split, losing a match to Princeton on Friday night but rallying strong against NJIT for a 1-1 weekend.
HARVARD 3, NJIT 2
Coming off of a disappointing loss to Princeton on Friday night, Harvard (EIVA, 2-2) came back ready against New Jersey Institute of Technology (EIVA, 0-2). The first set saw both a strong offensive and defensive force by the Crimson. The blocking duo of freshman Ryan Hong and sophomore Griffin Schmit opened up the Harvard lead during the middle of the set, only further aided by freshman libero Jason Shen’s spectacular digs. Ultimately, Harvard dominated the first set 25-18.
The second set saw an even back and forth as both teams exchanged points and possessions. An ace by the Highlander’s 11 sparked a lead between the two teams, eventually having NJIT up by four at 18-14. With Harvard down, a series of spikes by junior Matthew Ctvrtlik and Schmit allowed the Crimson to come back 21-23. However, the Highlander’s offense proved too strong as they took the second set 25-21 and equalized the match at 1-1.
In the third set, both teams came out with ferocious energy. Two quick spikes from senior Trevor Dow brought a 10-7 lead to the Crimson. However, the Highlanders rebounded with a series of spikes and kills and brought the set to 14-14, despite the best defensive efforts of libero Shen. A vicious spike by freshman Campbell Schoenfeld broke open the deadlock, putting Harvard up 18-15. After a quick timeout by the NJIT side, the Harvard offense came back even more dominant, going on an unanswered offensive tear of 7 points to lead the set 24-15. The set was closed off with a dominant spike by the Crimson, ending the set 25-16.
Ready to finish the match, Harvard’s Schoenfeld opened up the set with a dominant kill. However, a series of mishaps allowed the Highlanders to grow their lead to 6-2 before a kill by freshman Ryan Hong gave Harvard a glimmer of hope. The Crimson rallied back from a four point deficit to bring the set to 10-12. However, NJIT managed to hold on to their lead, pushing the match to a fifth set.
With intensity building, the fifth set saw a back and forth as the teams tied up 7-7. A block by co-captians Ctyrtlik and Dow gave Harvard the lead. A series of spikes and kills ultimately lead to a Crimson victory, ending the set 15-12 and winning the match 3-2.
“Our first five set match win is a really good sign for us. We have a lot of young guys out there making a lot of progress every week and to get this win, these guys have really earned it,” Coach Baise stated. “We played better at the service line and put pressure on their passers. This was the complete game that we were looking to put together.”
PRINCETON 3, HARVARD 1
After a dominant win against conference rival Saint Francis, Harvard came back ready to continue the effort on their home defense this weekend. Facing Princeton (EIVA, 3-0) on Friday, Harvard (EIVA, 2-1) fell short on the first set, dropping it 18-25. However, a strong rally in the second set allowed the Crimson to win 25-23. With the match tied at 1-1, a tense rally between the two teams eventually settled with a Tiger victory, 25-22.
Despite its best efforts, Harvard was unable to equalize the match in the fourth set, allowing the Princeton to claim the match 3-1 with a 25-20 final set. In terms of all-time record, the Crimson fell to 23-36 against the Tigers.
“We didn’t play great defense,” said head coach Brian Baise. “We know we have to defend better. We’re going to have to continue focusing on defense. If we can slow other teams down, we’ll give ourselves a better chance to win.”
“It’s always tough taking a plane flight somewhere and playing back to back days in a crowded gym,” Ctyrlik stated. “It’s going to be another test and we have to move forward in the season. I think we’re going to keep improving and see some good things next week.”
“We’ve got a big weekend next weekend against Charleston so we’re certainly going to keep pushing,” Coach Baise said.“They’re really important matches and we’re going to continue to focus on defense.”
Harvard will be travelling to West Virginia next weekend for matches against Charleston on Friday and Saturday.
