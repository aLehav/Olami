After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bathed in warm light, the Ethelbert Cooper Gallery’s newest exhibition, “Wole Soyinka: Antiquities Across Times and Place,” provides a critical take on a collector’s purpose. Slated to run through December 21, the show provides the setting for a series of related book talks scheduled in the coming few weeks. The exhibition skirts canonical Western museum practices and speaks instead to the act of collecting as a living, breathing tradition meant to promote dialogue.
The gallery showcases artworks related to the life of playwright, poet, and Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka. The artist has earned acclaim and renown for both his work and his criticism of the Nigerian government. The exhibit, curated by Awam Amkpa, a dramatist and professor at New York University, speaks to Soyinka’s interaction with his Yoruba heritage and with contemporary civil rights conversations.
The exhibit is composed of artworks relocated from their original contexts and combined in new ways. Soyinka is quoted in the gallery text, “I had not known—in a personal, tactile manner—of the systematic robbery of African  artifacts, only read about it as part of African history, did not know that, progressively, African art had changed homes, becoming denizens more of Europe and America than of their ancestral home.”
The collection, therefore, aligns with the Cooper Gallery’s mission of instigating cultural conversations. Overlooking the entryway is Osaretin Ighile’s “Oba Ovonramwen,” a statue of a king draped in reclaimed plastic. Director Vera I. Grant said that introducing a predominantly Yoruba collection with a Benin sculpture was a deliberate choice. “This combination is disputing any type of understanding that creates these different ethnic groups as singular, insular cultures that do not communicate with each other or are only in conflict,” Grant says.
As one moves through the gallery, this idea of cultural dialogue emerges as a common thread. The media room features several sculptural pieces from artist Olu Amoda. Depicting characters from Soyinka’s award-winning play “Death and the King’s Horseman” and complemented by a performance on video, the room serves as an extended interpretation of [Soyinka’s] seminal work and seeks to further bridge the visual and performative arts.
This confluence of medium has resonated with the student community. Reflecting on his experience at the gallery, Caleb C. Rak ’21 says, “I think exhibitions like this have a tremendous value. I think it’s really important to show a wide array of different art styles and, eventually, too, then to give a venue for a variety of different artists to share their work.” The exhibition takes this idea of dialogue a step further, juxtaposing more historical pieces with modern works from contemporary artists including Moyo Okediji and Peju Alatise.
Indeed, by combining oft-isolated artworks, “Antiquities Across Time and Place” gives the act of collecting new life. One example is the exhibition’s Ife sculpture: such a piece, which is more modern and perhaps perceived as less authentic than its counterparts, would not usually be in a gallery of older artwork.
As a whole, the exhibition invites its viewers to create new understanding from its pieces. Romil A. Sirohi ’21, another visitor to the exhibition, said, “I think that, more than making just a statement about Africa, it makes a statement about humanity as a whole and people coming together to overcome a great challenge.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The U.S. Department of Justice is threatening to file a lawsuit against Harvard unless the school hands over student records, a request the Department made as part of its ongoing investigation into allegations of racial discrimination in the College’s admissions processes.
In a letter to Harvard’s lawyers first obtained by The Wall Street Journal, the Justice Department stated that its Civil Rights Division is investigating the University for allegedly violating Title VI, which prohibits race-based discrimination in programs receiving federal funding.
The Justice Department’s probe into allegations that Harvard’s admissions processes unfairly disadvantage Asian-American applicants came to light in August. But the investigation has stalled as Harvard has refused to turn over “a single document” to the government, according to a Nov. 17 letter from John M. Gore, acting assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division.
Moving forward, the Justice Department has threatened to take legal action to fulfill the document request if Harvard does not meet the new deadline of Dec. 1, according to Gore’s letter.
University spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven wrote in a statement that Harvard will comply with its Title VI responsibilities. “In the process, we have an obligation to protect the confidentiality of student and applicant files and other highly sensitive records, and we have been seeking to engage the Department of Justice in the best means of doing so,” she wrote.
Harvard’s lawyers have also raised several concerns with the Justice Department’s request.
In a series of letters from Harvard’s lawyers to the Justice Department, Seth P. Waxman ’73, a partner at the law firm representing Harvard, wrote that the investigation seemed “exceptionally unusual” given that the complaint the Department is acting on was filed over two years ago.  A coalition of Asian-American groups filed that complaint in 2015, and the Department of Education dismissed it the same year, though it remained opened in the Department of Justice.
Waxman wrote in an Oct. 6 letter to Gore that it was also atypical for the Justice Department to investigate issues that are concurrently being litigated. A separate ongoing lawsuit, brought by anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions in 2014, accuses Harvard of setting illegal racial quotas in its undergraduate admissions processes.
Waxman also requested in the same letter that the Justice Department share the specific complaints filed against the University, as well as any communications about the investigation between the Justice Department, Students for Fair Admissions, and outside legal counsel.
According to the Oct. 6 letter, Harvard has asked for a confidentiality agreement regarding the use of information related to student applications, with “specific assurances that the materials would remain confidential.” The Justice Department rejected the proposal.
“[T]he Department is under no obligation to, and ordinarily does not, enter into confidentiality agreements with any entity subject to a Title VI investigation,” Matthew J. Donnelly, an attorney in the Civil Rights Division, replied in a letter obtained by the Wall Street Journal.
According to Roger Clegg, the Justice Department’s investigation may not directly interfere with the Students for Fair Admissions lawsuit, but it is likely to help it along. Clegg is the president of the conservative think tank Center for Equal Opportunity, and has formerly held positions in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.
“In my experiences, having the U.S. government on your side in lawsuits is almost always a good thing and not a bad thing,” Clegg said.
Clegg said he believes the Justice Department’s threats of a lawsuit indicate the seriousness with which the Department is approaching the complaints leveled against Harvard.
“I think early on there was some question about what the Division’s approach was going to be,” Clegg said. “This shows that they are quite serious and that they’ve uncovered enough that they think that they need more information because they’re concerned that Harvard is violating the civil rights laws.”
Despite the current legal holdup, Clegg believes that the Justice Department’s investigation will ultimately find a way to move forward.
“The Justice Department is not going to be dissuaded by [Harvard], and they will continue to push,” Clegg said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Safety Zach Miller knows a thing or two about Harvard football.
Already, he has spent four seasons with the team and will return next fall for a fifth year of eligibility. In 2016, he nabbed a starting safety role in training camp. In 2017, he will serve as the Crimson’s 145th captain.
But four-and-a-half years ago, Miller didn’t know if he wanted to play at Harvard.
Sure, Miller had considered the possibility. He had attracted recruiting interest from several programs, including the Crimson. And Miller recognized the obvious benefits of Harvard—the academic rigor, the tradition, the dense opportunities.
The trouble was, Miller didn’t know what to expect from Crimson football. The Houston, Texas, native had grown up in a world of 4A football. Every season, the state championship took place in AT&T Stadium—a 100,000-person arena with a retractable roof. How would Harvard football compare? What would Crimson players be like?
Miller didn’t know. So as a high school senior, he flew to Cambridge on a weekend when the Crimson was holding an intrasquad scrimmage. That’s when Miller heard captain Josh Boyd ‘14 give a pregame speech. And that’s when Miller embraced Harvard.
“He just spoke with so much passion about the game,” Miller said. “I knew that’s where I wanted to be.”
The story has come a full circle for Miller. Last Monday at an end-of-season banquet, teammates elected the senior safety as the 145th captain of Crimson football. Miller now shoulders the same responsibilities as Boyd did.
Miller’s selection marks the 14th-straight year that a defensive player has commanded the team. Ryan Fitzpatriack ‘05, now a quarterback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, was the last exception.
Traditionally, linebackers have led Harvard. Five of the last seven captains have played the position, including Luke Hutton, the outgoing captain. Miller joins Norman Hayes ‘15 and Sean Ahern ‘17 as the most recent secondary members to head the program.
In 2016, Miller faced a slew of injuries. Listed as a starting safety in the season opener against Rhode Island, he didn’t play a snap. That Saturday, he hurt his hamstring on the opening kickoff.
He remained sidelined until late October, when he returned against Princeton. The next game, though, Miller aggravated the injury and sat out the rest of the year.
The setback encapsulated the season for the Crimson, which ran into a historic avalanche of injuries. Teammates praised Miller for his ability to rebound.
“Some guys shut down after an injury,” senior safety Tanner Lee said. “He didn’t do that.”
Given last season’s adversity, Miller has limited in-game experience. He has seen action in 12 contests and racked up 15 tackles, including a personal best of five versus the Tigers. In 2016, he blocked a punt at Brown.
Miller graduated from Stratford High School in Houston, the same school that quarterback Andrew Luck attended. Miller made the all-district team twice. In 2013, as a senior, Miller captained the Spartans to a state semifinal.
When healthy, Miller can fly around the field. His 6’1” frame allows him to cover ground quickly, and four years of watching film have honed his instincts.
Moreover, Miller has made off-field contributions for the Crimson. At times in 2017, he emerged as a vocal leader in the secondary. Lee highlighted another attribute—Miller’s sense of humor.
“He’s hilarious,” Lee said. “He’s always joking around in the locker room, getting everyone going.”
Miller will replace the linebacker Hutton, who made the All-Ivy second team for the second-straight year. Also a Texas native, Hutton paced the team with 79 tackles and tied for second with three pass breakups.
More significantly, Hutton managed emotions during a trying season. Early injuries decimated the defense, and the offense lurched between two quarterbacks. Harvard finished 5-5 for the first time since 2000.
“We know this season didn’t go as we wanted it to,” said Miller in a brief speech at the team banquet. “It didn’t go as expected. That hurts.”
Throughout this storm, Hutton stood as a constant. He started all games and recorded five or more tackles in nine of them. His work ethic and measured demeanor grounded the Crimson. In the last three games, the patchwork defense held the Columbia, Penn, and Yale offenses below 20 points each.
Miller watched these performances from the sideline. He felt the satisfaction of effort and the pain of losses. Last Monday, standing behind a podium at the final team dinner, he promised a different outcome in 2017.
“We will not tire next season,” Miller said. “We will work harder than any team has ever worked to get back to where we need to be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While most of the country spent Black Friday recovering from food comas, the Harvard men’s basketball team had to rally from a hangover of its own after suffering an 18-point loss to St. Mary’s on Turkey Day. With starters Corey Johnson and Seth Towns out with an illness, the Crimson rode the sophomore trio of Bryce Aiken, Robert Baker, and Chris Lewis to a 77-71 victory over St. Joseph’s on the second day of the Wooden Legacy in Fullerton, Calif. The win snapped a three-game losing streak for Harvard (3-3) and set up a showdown with host Cal State Fullerton for Sunday night.
“It's easy in a tournament to get up and be excited and enthusiastic to play in a game in the semifinals when you advance in a tournament,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “It's very difficult when you have a tough loss. I thought both teams played with a lot of heart today, it showed how much we both wanted to win and how hard we competed.”
Lewis kicked off the scoring, converting a hook shot in the lane and never looked back. The sophomore was dominant and efficient all game, making nine of his 12 field goal attempts and three of his four free throws. The Hawks (2-3) tried to give the Crimson big man different looks defensively but none was particularly successful. The Alpharetta, Ga., native finished the day with 21 points and nine rebounds, a performance that bore similarities to last season’s matchup with Boston College, in which Amaker rode his then-freshman’s 22 points to a eight-point road win.
"It wasn't hard to get their attention, we have tremendous kids, I'm blown away by their character and so it wasn't difficult at all,” Amaker said. “There was some things that needed to be said and how we need to play better and compete harder for 40 minutes and I thought they embraced that. I thought they did it themselves in terms of talking amongst themselves and wanting to do better.”
A Taylor Funk three got St. Joseph’s to within one with 9:40 to play but a 15-6 run over the next eight-plus minutes proved to be the difference for the Crimson. Aiken, Baker, and Lewis scored all but one of Harvard’s final 23 points to down the pesky Hawks.
"Just staying confident even though I shot horribly from the three in this tournament so far but it's alright, you just stick with it and like coach always preaches, short memory, you have to move on to the next play,” Aiken said. “But offensively, like I said, coach and my teammates they trust me a lot and it's up to me to produce for our team."
Following a slow start on Thursday, the Crimson made sure to flip the script on Friday afternoon. After falling behind 3-2 in the opening minutes of play, Harvard reeled off seven straight points and 16 of the next 19. Baker followed the stretch with an exclamation point, slamming down a powerful dunk while being fouled to push the lead to 14 with 10:33 to play in the first half.
“I was very pleased with the effort that our kids brought and I thought the opening few minutes of the game set the tone for us and we really tried to prepare for that,” Amaker said.
Despite bursts from the Crimson throughout the afternoon, St. Joseph’s refused to go away. Harvard led by as many as 14 in the first half but the lead stood at just six when halftime arrived.
Aiken and Lewis, two of the Crimson’s top three scorers entering the game, combined for 15 first half points. The duo was aided early on by Baker and Southern California native Henry Welsh, who chipped in six points on three-for-three shooting off the bench.
Baker continued to ride the wave into the second half. The Hawks had few answers for the jump shooting big man. The Woodstock, Ga., native finished with a career-high 14 points and 11 rebounds in his coming-out party. He turned the ball over just twice on a day in which his team only had 11 giveaways.
“Everybody just had to step up,” Baker said. “With Seth being out, I didn't want to do too much because nobody can replace what Seth does on this team, nobody in the country I don't think. I just wanted to step in and do my job, play my role and everything will take care of itself. I just had to do a better job of sticking to what I do best."
St. Joseph’s got to within one four times early in the second half but was unable to hold a lead after intermission. Even though the Hawks got to the line 31 times, Harvard was able to hold them to just 36.1 percent shooting from the field, the lowest mark for a Crimson opponent this season. Not to be outdone, Aiken got to the line 12 times himself, leading Harvard on a day when it took 25 free throw tries.
"Honestly, I just took what the defense gave me today,” Aiken said. “The coaches and the rest of my teammates do a terrific job of putting me in a position to be successful and I think I capitalized on the opportunities that were there today.”
While Baker hit three triples, Amaker clearly missed Johnson and Towns, two of the team’s top three-point threats. A day after shooting a measly 19 percent from three, the Crimson made just seven of its 25 attempts from long range.
On the defensive end, Harvard was able to neutralize St. Joseph’s potent backcourt on Friday afternoon. Shavar Newkirk, a product of the Bronx’s Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx, and Chris Clover, out of St. Joseph’s Prep in Philadelphia, combined for just 11 points on 3-of-15 shooting. Free throws largely kept the Hawks in the game but the Crimson was able to play without fouling down the stretch.
“They know we are better than the team that we displayed in our first game and I thought they were determined to make that a reality this afternoon,” Amaker said.
