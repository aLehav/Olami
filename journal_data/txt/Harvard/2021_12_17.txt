After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON — Defense attorneys representing Harvard professor Charles M. Lieber, who is facing trial for allegedly lying to federal investigators about his ties to China, sparred with prosecutors on Thursday over the evidentiary relevance of documents obtained during raids of the prominent chemist’s home and office.
Lieber faces six felony charges that include making materially false statements to federal investigators and failing to report his income and foreign bank accounts to government agencies.
On Thursday, the third day of the trial, prosecutors questioned FBI Special Agent Kara D. Spice, who participated in the arrest and interview of Lieber in January 2020.
Through Spice’s testimony, prosecutors introduced a trove of documents recovered in FBI raids on Lieber's Harvard office and Lexington, Mass., home. The evidence included emails between Lieber and a former student, Liqiang Mai, who oversaw an unauthorized joint Harvard-Wuhan University of Technology laboratory where Lieber worked as the lab director, according to the government’s evidence.
In emails, Mai referred to Lieber as a “high level foreign expert” with the Thousand Talents Program, a Chinese government initiative to recruit foreign scientists. Prosecutors allege that Lieber made false statements to federal officials regarding his involvement with the TTP. Lieber’s defense team maintains that he was cooperative with investigators and made no attempt to mislead them.
In a 2012 email, Mai wrote that Lieber had been approved by the Chinese government as a “strategic foreign expert” in the TTP, years before his interviews with authorities. Mai also emailed Lieber with contracts for his work with WUT as a “strategic scientist.”
The defense objected to many of the emails being admitted into evidence, saying that Lieber never acknowledged or responded to them.
“This is a Publishers Clearing House email,” Lieber’s lead defense attorney, Marc L. Mukasey, said of one of the emails presented by prosecutors. “If somebody sends me an email saying I'm part of something or I’ve won something, it doesn't mean I am.”
Jurors also heard continued testimony from Renée R. Donlon, a former administrative coordinator for Lieber’s research group who began testifying on Wednesday.
Donlon said she was responsible for coordinating logistical details and assembling travel itineraries for the trips Lieber took to Wuhan, China, between 2012 and 2014. In her testimony, she identified Lieber’s Chinese bank card, supporting the government’s charge that he had a foreign bank account, which prosecutors allege he failed to report to the Internal Revenue Service.
Defense attorney Stephanie Guaba questioned Donlon about trips Lieber took to Canada and Israel, but Donlon was unable to confirm or deny any details about the trips without travel summaries present.
Before the trial let out at 1 p.m. Thursday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason A. Casey said he now expects the government’s case to conclude Monday, rather than Friday.
“I think we're a little behind, but not too far behind,” Casey said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Grappling with its worst on-campus Covid-19 surge since the start of the pandemic, Harvard announced Thursday that it will require affiliates to receive Covid-19 booster shots during the spring semester.
The announcement comes as the school’s on-campus Covid numbers are at an all-time high. In an email to affiliates on Thursday, University administrators wrote that the Omicron variant is “likely already present” on campus.
Individuals who are unable to attain booster shots before they return to school in the spring will not be barred from campus, administrators wrote, promising affiliates “additional opportunities” to receive the shots.
In an email Thursday, University President Lawrence S. Bacow, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp, and Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen wrote that the presence of Omicron “should inform” affiliates’ behavior. The administrators called it “critical” that students follow public health measures including masking, social distancing, and testing.
“Our preliminary analysis indicates the Omicron variant is likely already present in COVID-19 cases we are seeing on campus,” the administrators wrote. “Individuals are not routinely notified of their variant status because public health guidelines are the same regardless of the variant involved.”
More than 270 Harvard affiliates — including 86 undergraduates — have tested positive for the virus in the last week, according to the University’s Covid-19 Testing Dashboard. Harvard’s positivity rate now stands at 0.68 percent, despite 97 percent of students and employees being fully vaccinated.
The University also announced Thursday that it will extend Covid-19 workplace policies enacted March 2020 through April 1, 2022. The policies include greater flexibility in sick time accrual and emergency absences for employees whose work has been disrupted by the pandemic.
Other peer institutions have also mandated booster shots amid the Covid surge, including Princeton, Brown, Boston University, and New York University.
On Thursday, Harvard University Dining Services shifted to grab and go dining amid the Covid-19 surge. Some large lecture classes have opted to give students the option to take final exams online, including Economics 1010a: “Intermediate Microeconomics.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 16, 2021 at 9:59 p.m.
Harvard College admitted 7.9 percent of early applicants to the Class of 2026 Thursday as its early acceptance rate remained markedly lower than pre-pandemic years.
The College invited 740 of 9,406 early applicants to join the Class of 2026 on Thursday at 7 p.m. The 7.9 percent acceptance rate marks a 0.5 percent increase from last year’s record-low of 7.4 percent. This year is the second-most competitive early admissions cycle in Harvard’s history.
The number of early applicants this year decreased by 681, representing a 6.7 percent drop from last year’s applicant pool of 10,087. This marks just the third year in which the total number of early applicants has decreased from the previous cycle since Harvard reinstated its early action admissions program in 2011.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said in a press release that this year’s applicant pool was “outstanding” and “talented.”
“This year’s admitted class brings to Harvard robust talents and life experiences that will shape our community for years to come,” he said.
The Class of 2026 is the second class that was not required to submit standardized testing, a reform instituted in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Applicants to Harvard College will not be required to submit ACT or SAT scores for the next four application cycles — until the Class of 2031. Instead, the College said it will continue assessing applicants on other accomplishments, such as extracurricular activities, work experience, and familial obligations.
Fitzsimmons, who has served as Harvard admissions dean since 1986, said students who do not submit test scores “will not be disadvantaged in their application process.”
The percentage of admitted students who identify as African American was 13.9 percent, a decrease from 16.6 percent of early action admits last year. The percentage of Latinx students admitted early to the College remained steady at 10.5 percent this year, compared to 10.4 percent last year. Asian American applicants constitute 25.9 percent of the early admits, a slight increase from last year’s 23.4 percent. The number of Native American and Native Hawaiian applicants increased from 1.3 percent to 3.7 percent for the Class of 2026.
The number of admitted international students increased slightly, from 12.2 percent to 12.6 percent.
Nearly 12 percent of students admitted to the Class of 2026 hail from first-generation college backgrounds, a decrease from 16.7 percent of early action admits last year.
The College plans to welcome admitted students at an in-person Visitas weekend held on campus on April 24-25. Regular decision applicants have until Jan. 1 to apply.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Applicants to Harvard College will not be required to submit standardized test scores for at least the next four years.
The College announced Thursday that it would extend its pandemic-era test optionality policy, allowing applicants through the Class of 2030 to apply to the school without submitting SAT or ACT scores.
Harvard first lifted its testing requirement in June 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, allowing the Class of 2025 to apply without submitting scores. Harvard then removed the requirement for the Class of 2026 in January, citing continued difficulties presented by the pandemic.
When the College announced that it would accept 7.9 percent of early action applicants as part of its Class of 2026, it stated it would extend the test-optional policy further.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said in the press release that students who do not submit an SAT or ACT score will not be disadvantaged in the admissions process.
“Their applications will be considered on the basis of what they have presented, and they are encouraged to send whatever materials they believe would convey their accomplishments in secondary school and their promise for the future,” Fitzsimmons said.
The move comes as a win for advocates who have been pushing universities to do away with testing requirements, arguing that they disadvantage applicants from low-income backgrounds.
Harvard cited pandemic-related complications in its announcement.
“Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its continued impact on access to testing for high school age students, Harvard College will allow students to apply for admission without requiring SAT or ACT scores for the upcoming admitted classes of ’27, ’28, ’29, and ’30,” the school wrote.
The College wrote that it will continue assessing applicants on factors other than standardized testing, including extracurricular activities, work experience, and familial obligations.
“​Consistent with Harvard’s whole-person admissions process, standardized tests are one factor among many considered,” the announcement read.
Columbia University and Cornell University have each suspended standardized testing requirements through the 2024 application cycle. The University of Chicago went test optional in 2018, prior to the pandemic.
