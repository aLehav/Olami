After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ruben: When I listen close to the freshmen bustling around — especially those like me, Latinx students, the children of immigrants, people who feel out of place — I’m brought back to my first few weeks on campus. Back then, Latinx upperclassmen were my saving grace. They told me that this place wasn’t built for people like me. They encouraged me to get mental health counseling.They helped me believe, through their example, that I too could be a researcher, writer, artist, all-around-badass.

Zoe: I was nervous. Doubt plagued me as I asked, “I don’t speak Spanish fluently, can I be in your community?” I’d grown up being called white-washed for not instinctively speaking Spanish. So, I waited for the self-assured Harvard Latina to dismiss me, to ask, “How can you even consider yourself Mexican?” Instead, she smiled and said, “Of course.” With those two words she gave me hope and breathed life into an identity I’d never been empowered to claim. I thought, maybe, this could be my community, too.  

R: After only a few months, I’d seen how differently these upperclassmen understood Harvard. Harvard for them was microaggressions, questions about their worth, classism, mental health appointments, and lack of good and timely ones. And, shockingly to me then, but far too real now, they also had problems with the Latinx community. Some defined themselves as bitter, fed up with the drama and disagreements within these circles.

Z: I was in love. In love with the strength that came from walking into a room and feeling accepted, affirmed in my identity. But, it wasn’t all perfect. When the veneer of being in a new environment fell away, I could see the strain on their faces. They’d talk about why some people didn’t come around anymore, why some organizations refused to collaborate. I fell hard and fast into this imperfect community. Before I knew it, I was dreaming about how I could fix it. I wanted to recreate how it felt when that upperclassman said I could be who I’d always wanted to be: a Latina.

R: When the upperclassmen who I’d relied on slowly pulled back from the community — stepping out of leadership roles, showing up less often to meetings and events — my reaction was visceral. Logically, I understood they had increasingly busy lives. Yet, given their role in preparing me to face an often inhospitable institution, it was difficult to see them go. I promised I’d never be bitter, that I’d stick around to help the Latinx community improve its cohesion and reach.

Z: I was in deep. I had deadlines to meet, papers to submit, exams to take, but nothing seemed to matter more than supporting the Latinx community. I had to make sure we had enough money. I had to make sure we were reaching enough people. Did that Latinx student I just passed know about us? Did they feel welcome? Every day brought on a new worry and every hour found me trying to devise a solution. I couldn’t stop, because my love had turned into an impossible challenge. I could feel the pressure to fix every problem exposed to me. I gave it everything I had, but it still didn’t feel like enough.

R: I don’t know for certain why the upperclassmen stopped being involved,  but burnout must have played a role. You become tired, even in a community that you treasure deeply, and the exhaustion can eventually push you out. I am tired. It feels like a betrayal to admit that given how much I love all the underclassmen I’ve been lucky enough to mentor. But it’s true. I am tired. I am burnt out. Building community on this campus strips you down, takes a toll, and leaves you little choice but to retreat.

Z: I was still in love. I had reached a place of power. Finally, I thought, I could build a healthy community. But words of affirmation were few and far between. The community I’d always sought to please took all that I had to offer and told me I’d done nothing. The upperclassmen who had once nurtured me, said I was forgetting the people I spent every moment considering. But still, I couldn’t stop, even as I looked back and realized that most things had remained unchanged. That I hadn’t saved anything, even as I lost myself. But, I couldn’t lose hope, it was the only thing keeping me from becoming bitter.

R:  A paradox emerges: The Latinx community suffers when people don’t stick around to invest in it, but investing in it burns people out to the point where they don’t want to stick around. To prevent this cycle, we must acknowledge this particular brand of burnout. We must be kinder to each other, and realize that community-building is not easy, painless work. If we continue burning people out because it keeps events happening in the short term, we hurt our ability to make these organizations better for more students.

These two things can be true at once: I love every Latinx organization I’ve been a part of and I am burnt out. I hope that future members of the Latinx community at Harvard, those here now and those yet to be admitted, can work to make only the former true. Admitting that burnout is central to our community’s current design is the first step towards that future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From learning how to use intricate instruments in University-affiliated labs for science classes to participating in summer school programs hosted in College dorms, students from Cambridge Rindge and Latin School — many of whom are students of color and socioeconomically disadvantaged — have been able to benefit greatly from closer access to Harvard. We laud Harvard and its affiliates who have worked directly on these initiatives to promote educational equity and access to disadvantaged CRLS students, some of whom go on to gain admittance to the University.
The opportunities that the more-than-dozen University partnerships provide to CRLS and other local schools have been deeply commendable. These programs have provided students from diverse backgrounds the opportunity to supplement their secondary education and, as a result, have fueled their college aspirations. Through these initiatives, Harvard and its affiliates have encouraged local high school students to participate in a larger intellectual community.
Harvard, with its vast sources of wealth and prestige, has often had significantly strained relationships with the communities surrounding it, particularly over issues of economics and taxation. Given this strain, it is heartening to see that in many ways the University is taking steps through these programs to redress some of the grievances that have been raised — using its educational clout not merely for its own students, but for those of its wider community. As increasing attention is drawn to the relationship between elite colleges and their socioeconomically disadvantaged local communities around the country, we are heartened by Harvard’s example of incorporating communal outreach into its initiatives.
As we consider these beneficial programs in Cambridge, however, it is important that we see how Harvard can do more to promote similar initiatives in other communities within its scope. With the University’s expansion across the Charles River in Allston, we hope that the same level of community engagement we have seen in Cambridge can be expanded there. Perhaps professors working at the new campus might be willing to share resources with the community into which they have moved.
We have previously warned of the effects that the new campus may have on the Allston community, including gentrification, high land prices, and decreasing affordability. We hope that Harvard’s commitment to community engagement can help to offset some of these trends, and that the University does its best to be a good neighbor to the community. Such efforts might begin with an expansion of these education-based community projects, such as the Harvard Allston Education Portal.
It is important, however, to recognize the extent to which the development plans for the new campus, a concern to the community for decades, have been met with ideas and requests raised by Allston residents over how Harvard can offset its projects’ impact on affordable housing, transportation, and community-centric land use. As Allston residents and Harvard-Allston Task Force members argued in a June 2013 meeting, sharing educational resources is a step in the right direction, but overlooks the larger concerns of the affected neighborhood. As such, the University must proceed with caution and respect for a quickly changing community, heeding its suggestions and concerns throughout a working relationship.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ever since Justice Anthony M. Kennedy retired last summer, his legal legacy has been hotly debated. But one thing is for certain — his legacy will forever be tarnished by the inequity he perpetuated in his hiring of judicial clerks, and he’s not alone. Both Justices Samuel A. Alito and Ruth Bader Ginsburg have reportedly only hired one black clerk ever in their times on the bench.
State and federal judges across the country hire recent law school graduates for one-year clerkships, which are widely considered among the most prestigious jobs a young lawyer can get. Since 2005, 85 percent of Supreme Court clerks have been white and two-thirds have been men. Justice Kennedy alone hired six times as many men as women for his clerkships between 2005 and 2017. In the meantime, women made up the majority of students in law school for the first time in 2016, so there’s no shortage of qualified candidates in the pipeline. Why then are people of color, BGLTQ people, women, and other marginalized groups so underrepresented in our country’s court chambers — and what can be done about it?
There is no doubt just how discriminatory the clerkship system can be, from rampant unchecked sexual harassment to persistent gross disparities in the representation of people of color, women, and other marginalized groups. The new national clerkship hiring pilot plan is essential to creating an equitable environment for students interested in clerking and combating the lack of diversity in the judiciary. The clerkship hiring process has long advantaged the well-connected and powerful to the detriment of minority, first-generation, and female students, who have lacked equal access to information and resources available through traditional legal networks. In some cases, networks like the Federalist Society help certain students circumvent the common application process for clerkships and even the requirement for full applications through a system of closely-guarded lists. In other instances, students from privileged backgrounds are simply ready to apply sooner because of their familiarity with “what it takes,” creating a race to secure clerkships that has pushed the process all the way back from a student’s third year of law school to the middle of their first.
As clerkship application timelines have become front-loaded, students who would benefit from additional time to adjust to law school — or who may lack an insider’s understanding of the competitive process — have been left at a significant strategic disadvantage. The new clerkship hiring pilot plan, which Harvard Law School and many judges have opted into, pushes back the recruitment and hiring timeline, which helps even the playing field in a few key ways. First, it gives first-generation and non-traditional law students, who may take longer to adjust to law school, a chance to get more grades on their transcripts, enabling them to become more competitive clerkship applicants. In addition, the plan gives students more time to research judges and establish relationships with professors who can guide them through the hiring process, which is especially necessary for marginalized students who may be more vulnerable to harassment and discrimination in hostile clerkship environments.
In the interest of creating a more diverse class of clerks, it is imperative that students adhere to the timelines set out in the clerkship plan. The two-year pilot requires student cooperation to be successful and to encourage judges to continue with the plan beyond the pilot. We call upon students to cooperate by refraining from actively seeking positions and preparing applications before the end of their second year.
Of equal importance, professors, too must refrain from writing letters of recommendation, speaking with judges, or consenting to serving as a reference on behalf of students before the end of their second year. Unfortunately, there have already been multiple accounts of Law School students securing clerkships a year ahead of this timeline, which almost necessarily required the collaboration of professors willing to serve as references ahead of the plan’s timeline.
Harvard Law School led the way in pushing for this important reform when the clerkship application process last devolved into a race to the bottom. As the largest law school in the country, Harvard has a tremendous amount of power to ask judges, students, and faculty to follow this plan. The Law School’s administration must take active steps to ensure that its students and professors alike are operating in the spirit of this critical program — especially given that we already know some are not. And now, the Law School community must come together to support this policy so that we may avoid the same fate again.
Law school student organizations also play a crucial role in the success of the hiring plan. They foster and maintain vital networks that help connect their members with professional opportunities. But those networks cannot and should not be exploited to undermine the spirit of the pilot. Accordingly, 38 student groups at Harvard Law School, from the Mediation Program to the Mississippi Delta Project, have committed to follow the pilot framework and encourage members to do the same. Although clerkship hiring isn't directly related to the mission of many of these groups, all of us have a common interest in supporting equity in the legal profession at large.
These inequities in a court’s chambers shape the perspectives of the nation’s most powerful judges — and therefore the law itself. Representation is not enough to ensure justice for marginalized groups, but in an era when our country’s most vulnerable are under constant attack, representation matters more than ever. Not only should students and student organizations continue to encourage compliance with the plan, other law schools should follow suit and ensure that their resources are not being used to help individuals circumvent the pilot program.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The price to see Milo Ventimiglia accept the Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ Man of the Year Award on Feb. 8 is $250, more than 12 times the $20 some students paid to see Bryce Dallas Howard at the Woman of the Year awards on Jan. 31.
Originally priced at $100, Woman of the Year ticket prices dropped first to $50 — a deal reserved exclusively for Hasty Pudding Club members — before dropping again to $20 for all students on Jan. 30 after the award show failed to sell out.
Club members seeking to attend the Man of the Year event still had to pay $250 for their tickets.
This is not the first time the Pudding has priced Man of the Year tickets significantly higher than Woman of the Year tickets. Last year, Man of the Year tickets sold for $200 while Woman of the Year tickets were $80.
Hasty Pudding Theatricals President Grace C. Ramsey ’19 said the difference in ticket prices is due to the fact that the Pudding show's opening night will take place at the Man of the Year event.
The Pudding traditionally produces a burlesque performance in which male actors dress in drag each year, according to its website. Last year, the group announced they would begin to accept female actors in their cast. Previously, women were able to hold positions on the group’s business, design, and tech boards, but they were not able to perform on stage — a decision that drew criticism in recent years.
This year’s show, titled “France France Revolution,” will feature six women in its cast, ending nearly 200 years of male-only performances.
Ishaan Prasad ’22, a member of the Hasty Pudding Club, said he believes one reason for the disparity in ticket prices is the timing of the official premiere of the show.
“The ticket price might reflect the fact that the full show is being shown at the Man of the Year, versus at the Woman of the Year,” he said.
“Additionally, there’s more alumni,” he added, referencing the fact that the Man of the Year event coincides with alumni weekend.
The Woman of the Year festivities included a roast and a parade around Harvard Square. Afterward, Hasty Pudding Theatricals performed a preview of “France France Revolution.”
In addition to the full show, the Man of the Year celebration will also include a roast, but not a parade, and the group is billing the occasion as an “extremely festive black-tie event that kicks off our alumni weekend,” according to the Pudding’s website.
Ramsey also said Man of the Year tickets sold out even before the group announced they would honor Ventimiglia.
“Alumni, patrons, and members of the Harvard and greater Boston community are excited not just to see our Man of the Year roast, but because they want to witness history and support the undergraduate women on stage,” Ramsey said.
Hasty Pudding Club member Ryan R. Santos ’22 said the reduced ticket prices originally available to club members influenced his decision to purchase a ticket to the Woman of the Year event.
“If you were in the club, they were $50. I thought that was just a deal for the club members,” Santos said. “I didn't know there was some disparity between the prices for the Man and the prices for the Woman of the Year.”
Adam S. Levin ’22, also a member of the Hasty Pudding Club, said he thought the Pudding reduced ticket prices to ensure a full audience during Howard’s roast.
“They want to make sure that she, Bryce Dallas Howard, feels really welcomed and feels really excited by the Harvard community,” Levin said. “To get as many people packed in that theater as possible, I think, is a great way to show our appreciation for her.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Economics 10b: “Principles of Economics” has long reigned as spring semester's most enrolled-in class, but this year the course saw a new contender from within its own department — the brand new course Economics 1152: “Big Data."
Professor Raj Chetty ’00, who teaches Economics 1152, rejoined Harvard’s faculty this summer after a stint at Stanford. He said he is “delighted” about the high enrollment, especially since it is the course’s first semester. The new course came in third place overall, behind Economics 10b and Life Sciences 1b: “An Integrated Introduction to the Life Sciences,” which had 443 enrollees.
Economics 10b’s complementary fall course Economics 10a: “Principles of Economics,” fell from first to third in the enrollment rankings last fall. The spring iteration maintained its top spot, but still saw a decrease of more than 100 students this year, falling from 585 in 2018 to 455 students this year.
Economics Professor N. Gregory Mankiw, who has taught Economics 10a and 10b since 2005, said he thinks students find the course’s incorporation of multiple disciplines appealing.
“On the one hand it’s really about the real-world, the every-day. On the other hand, it’s a rigorous analytic discipline,” Mankiw said. “You can apply the tools you learn both in a math course and in a history course to study the world in a new way.”
Economics 1152 similarly focuses on incorporating interdisciplinary approaches, Chetty said. He said the course is designed to attract students in the College who many not have been exposed to economics or social sciences prior to taking the course.
“The goal is to show how the questions and the issues being addressed in these fields are so important and so exciting and can use a lot of the tools that students are learning in other classes at Harvard like computer science, statistics, economics,” he said.
Chetty said he hopes to show the different ways economics can be useful in approaching social problems, and that the class might entice first-time economics students to try out more classes in related fields.
“What we’re trying to do in this class, which might be a broader shift in the way economics and social science is taught at Harvard and elsewhere, is to start with the questions and the applications and show students why it’s useful to learn the methods,” he said.
Psychology 18: “Abnormal Psychology,” took the number four spot with 415 enrollees this year. The course focuses on the evaluation of the causes and mechanisms of mental illness, according to its course guide listing.
The fifth most popular course this term is Statistics 104: “Intro to Quantitative Methods for Economics,” with 336 enrollees. The class was the second most popular course last year.
Statistics Senior Lecturer Michael I. Parzen, who teaches the course, said students are drawn to the fact that skills covered in the course are applicable to a wide range of disciplines.
“The bottom line is a course like Stat 104 improves one's skill set even if your ultimate goal isn't to be an economist, consultant, Wall Street trader, or whatever,” Parzen said. “One sees data in marketing, nonprofits, politics, advertising, sports, medicine, law and so on.”

Student organizations across the University combined efforts last week to submit multiple comments — including a 33-page joint statement — to the United States Department of Education about Secretary of Education Betsy D. DeVos’s proposed Title IX rules.
DeVos released the new rules in November 2018, opening them up for a 60-day public notice-and-comment period that ended Jan. 30. By the comment period’s official close, the Department had received more than 100,000 comments.
Students from the College, Law School, Kennedy School, and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences filed comments. The University submitted its own comments via the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in Massachusetts and the Association of American Universities, while the College’s Undergraduate Council and several professors at the Law School also shared their thoughts.
Six Harvard graduate and undergraduate student groups contributed to the joint comment, including campus anti-sexual assault advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better, the Harvard Graduate Student Union’s Time’s Up Committee, and the Harvard Law School’s Harassment and Assault Law-Student Team.
Sanika S. Mahajan ’21, an organizer with Our Harvard Can Do Better, said that though the group originally planned to submit an independent comment, they decided it would be productive to join forces with other campus organizations.
“We thought it was a great idea because it allows us to give the Department of Education a comprehensive, unified overview of the perspectives we bring from Harvard,” she said.
Rebecca F. Prager, the president of the Law School’s Harassment and Assault Law-Student Team, wrote in an emailed comment that the group was proud to share its concerns with DeVos’s office.
“It was such a wonderful opportunity to work with other Harvard University students and groups on the comment, especially given the significant implications the proposed Title IX rules will have for our community,” she wrote.
In the joint comment, the student groups highlighted their concerns with the proposed rules’ live hearing process and its redefinition of sexual assault. They also wrote the new rules may make investigative processes appear to be more similar to criminal trial proceedings.
“Title IX is civil law and not criminal law, because the maximum punishment schools may implement is a requirement to withdraw, not the stripping of civil liberties,” the groups wrote in their comment. “At Harvard, many students also turn to Title IX because they do not wish to endure the traumas of a criminal investigation; they merely seek sufficient remedy that they may finish their educations.”
The groups also argued the new changes stem from an underlying belief that there is an “an epidemic” of false sexual misconduct accusations against men at universities.
“We are concerned that the narrative of false accusations and men being victimized by false reporting incorrectly identifies Title IX enforcement as only benefitting women, when a robust Title IX enforcement actually benefits men as well,” they wrote, also noting that Harvard’s 2014 sexual assault survey found that 23 percent of complainants were men.
Ege Yumusak ’16, an organizer with HGSU Time’s Up, wrote in an emailed statement that HGSU Time’s Up joined in the effort because they know they “cannot afford to lose the hard-won protections from Title IX.”
In addition to the joint comment, Mahajan said Our Harvard Can Do Better supported ten other student groups in writing comments of their own.
“We wanted to give them all the chance to explain from their perspective and the perspective of their members what they think about the new Title IX rules and regulations,” she said. “We did help them in the process by giving them resources.”
Mahajan said she is happy with the response Our Harvard Can Do Better received from the other student organizations.
“We’re so grateful to the organizations that we’ve worked with to write this comment, and also the other organizations that wrote their own individual comments with us,” she added.

Harvard will receive 73,000 Turkish lira — equivalent to roughly $14,000 — after Halil Çil, a Turkish citizen, licensed Harvard’s trademark to language and private schools in Turkey without the University's authorization.
Harvard notified Turkish lawyer Okan Çan of the issue in 2014 and found that Çil had licensed Harvard trademarks to 30 different educational institutions across Turkey. Çan, an intellectual property lawyer with the Deris legal group who has represented Harvard before, said that Çil's use of the Harvard trademark took many forms.
“He was using the Harvard trademark on schools, on the plates and on the buildings, and they were using Harvard again on the education materials on their websites, either as content or as a domain name,” Çan said. “They were also using the Harvard trademark on their social media accounts, and these were all infringing on Harvard trademark rights.”
The case was decided in Harvard's favor on April 10, 2018, by Judge Sule Binnaz Aydin Yunus. A press release on the case was published in Turkey on Jan. 12. Çil and his associated companies Birlesik Markalar and Harvard Publishers were defended by Vuslat Kocak Pinar.
Çil’s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.
The Harvard Trademark Program, which protects the University's trademark and authorizes its use around the world, first identified the issue.
"The Harvard Trademark Program became aware of an egregious violation of Harvard's trademark rights in Turkey that consisted of a franchise-type scheme by a Mr. Halil Çil to license the Harvard trademark for approximately two dozen schools,” Rick Calixto, Executive Director of the Harvard Trademark Program, wrote in an emailed statement.
Çil was found to have submitted dozens of applications to trademark offices in Turkey to secure ownership of different Harvard trademarks, according to University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain. Çan said all of Çil’s applications were rejected.
Swain wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard found fault with Çil’s use of the trademark because he both claimed the Harvard trademark as his own trademark and had licensed it to various schools.
After learning of Çil’s actions, Swain wrote that Harvard contacted Çil in an effort to remedy the issue before turning to litigation, but he refused to comply with Harvard’s demand that he stop using and licensing the Harvard trademark. Harvard filed its lawsuit in 2015.
Swain wrote that filing the suit against Çil was partly motivated by a desire to ensure the best interests of families who might send their children to the schools with the fake Harvard trademarks.
According to Çan, Çil and his lawyers defended him against Harvard’s lawsuit by noting that Çil owns the company Harvard Publishers.
“[Çil] had one registered company in the UK and one in Turkey for the same name, and he was claiming that he is entitled to use this name as a trademark as well,” Çan said. “This was his main argument in the main litigation.”
In response to Harvard’s lawsuit, Çan said Çil filed a countersuit in which he hoped to annul Harvard’s existing trademark registrations in Turkey, claiming that Harvard’s trademarks had not been used in Turkey for five years. The court decided in favor of the University in both the original suit and countersuit.
Swain wrote the lawsuit resulted in a permanent injunction against Çil’s use and licensing of the Harvard trademark in Turkey.
The University is ultimately receiving 73,000 Turkish lira resulting from the suit. The Hürriyet, a Turkish newspaper, reported that Çil made 2 million Turkish lira a month from his tradmark-licensing franchise, amounting to an annual income of over $4.5 million.
Çan said Harvard’s goal was not monetary compensation, but to “stop the schools as soon as possible” and inform them of their trademark infringement. Some of the franchised schools are now shut down and many have changed their names, he added.
Çil faces around 500 lawsuits from various institutions and parties within Turkey, including suits from the Turco-British Association and the Turkish-American Association, according to the Hürriyet.

Nearly 400 College students registered for joint Recognized Social Organization recruitment held by the Fleur-de-Lis, the Ivy, the Kali Praxi, and the Themis Asteri Club, according to Ivy President Margaret E. Reynolds ’20.
The number of students who expressed interest in the social clubs — all former sororities that went gender-neutral in the past year to avoid Harvard’s social group sanctions — marks an approximately fourfold increase from historically low turnout for sorority recruitment in spring 2018. Online registration for the joint recruitment closed Friday.
The sanctions, which took effect with the Class of 2021, bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding student group leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and from receiving College endorsement for certain prestigious fellowships.
As part of the first round of recruitment activities, prospective members met social group affiliates and leaders, traveling among four parties, each hosted by a different group. The Fleur took over the Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub, while the Ivy, the KP, and the TA hosted their events at the Student Organization Center at Hilles.
Event attendees, a majority of whom were female, said they are interested in joining the groups — now designated as Recognized Social Organizations by the College — because they are excited for the community that comes with being in the clubs.
Rachel L. Reynolds ’22, who was walking from the Quad to the Fleur meet-and-greet with friends, said she was excited to get to know some of the people she had met during the recruitment night.
“Already in my first session I actually met someone who lives an hour away from my house, which is an amazing thing to see,” she said. “I’m from the South, so I don’t meet a lot of people who are from right by my area.”
Many students who attended the recruitment activities said they decided to come partly because of the support the College has extended to RSOs.
“It’s just really cool to be a part of this legitimate process that’s approved by the school, and the potential to be in school-approved groups,” Ella Eisenberg ’22 said. “Recruitment itself is very accessible, and it was on the Yard bulletin, and all of that. The school clearly is supporting this.”
Zoe E. Brewer ’22 said she hopes to join a “female-empowered space” while avoiding the College’s social group penalties.
“I think that although I probably would have preferred to be in [a single-gender sorority], I’m scared,” she said. “I don’t want to be affected by sanctions.”
Touting their exemption from the College’s penalties, the four former sororities announced in January that they would partner to sponsor a joint recruitment process for new members during the spring semester. According to the groups’ organizing committee, the recruitment will “provide potential members the opportunity to meet” all the organizations and “hopefully find the group that is a best fit.”
Recruitment activities for the four RSOs began Monday night and consist of four rounds held over eight days. Events include a variety of socials, group outings like ice skating, and one-on-one conversations with current members.
But even as four former single-gender social organizations are working with the College to hold joint gender-neutral recruitment, some final clubs and Greek groups continue to fight the sanctions.
National groups affiliated with the four former sororities sued the University in December 2018, alleging the College’s sanctions are coercive, discriminatory, and unconstitutional. National organizations for Kappa Kappa Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Alpha Phi, and a Delta Gamma management corporation are among the plaintiffs in a pair of cases brought in federal and Massachusetts state court.
Ahead of those lawsuits, Harvard’s chapter of Alpha Phi — which disaffiliated from its national organization and went gender-neutral as the Ivy in August 2018 — reopened as a single-gender group in November 2018, while the Ivy continued as a gender-neutral organization. Eleven former Alpha Phi members have either rejoined the all-female sorority or “expressed interest in rejoining,” according to the complaint filed in state court.
The University must file formal responses to the parallel lawsuits by Feb. 8.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a strong performance at the St. John's Invitational in Queens, N.Y., Harvard fencing traveled back home to take on NYU. With a dominating performance from both No. 2 men’s fencing and No.7 women’s fencing, the Crimson marked another tally in the win column. Dating back to December, the men’s side has won eight out of its last ten bouts while the women’s has come away with 10 out of its last 13.
“We have Ivy League Championships next week,” junior co-captain Duncan Rheingans-Yoo said. “But you can never look ahead to the next match. You always have to focus on who is in front of you. So I was extremely happy today, the team was able to come out and have a strong showing.”
MEN: HARVARD 23, NYU 4
The No. 2 Harvard men’s team got off to fiery start against NYU, racking up multiple early victories against its visiting opponents at the Malkin Athletic Center.
“It felt really good, this was my first college meet in a long time,” said sophomore Geoffrey Tourette, who had competed internationally at the Junior World Cup over winter break, earning bronze. “It was good to get out there and fence really well. [I] started out and fenced really strongly out the gate.”
The Crimson continued to sustain that initial fire and eventually beat out NYU with a score of 23 to 4. Harvard’s dominance was in part lead by the men’s foil squad consisting of sophomore Geoffrey Tourette, junior co-captain Duncan Rheingans-Yoo, junior George Haglund, and junior Matt Branman.
The foil squad went a perfect 9-0, with Tourette netting the highest team touch differential of the day of +11 and moving to 14-0 on the season.
“First bout, Geoffrey goes out and gives a dominating performance and it really sets the tone for the day,” Rheingans-Yoo said. “It makes everything easier on the rest of us to get that confidence built.”
WOMEN: HARVARD 22, NYU 5
The No. 7 Harvard women’s team showcased a commanding performance against NYU, with junior and foil fencer Natalie Yang netting a team high touch differential of +12.
“Our performance was really great today,” senior and co-captain Shawn Wallace said. “The whole team came back early for J-term and this performance shows how much work we put in.”
The women’s epee squad — consisting of senior and co-captain Shawn Wallace, sophomore Cindy Gao, sophomore Saanchi Kukadia, senior Sharon Ra, and freshman Catherine Beddingfield — help lead the Crimson to victory with a perfect 9-0.
“Women’s epee definitely pulled through today,” Gao said. “We did not lose any bouts and we were not worried that we were gonna lose.”
Home field advantage also played a key part in both victories, with the Harvard crowd providing a large wave of support throughout the entire competition.
“Atmosphere is everything,” Wallace said. “The Harvard fencing team, we put a big emphasis on our teammates around us and the level of energy in the room, so home-field advantage is a great addition to that atmosphere.”
Both teams head to New Haven, CT., next weekend for the Ivy League Championship where its main competition will likely be Columbia, ranked nationally inside the top-four for both men’s and women’s.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard (10-7, 2-1 Ivy League) started its weekend road split with a heartbreaking defeat at the buzzer at the hands of the Bulldogs (13-6, 3-1 Ivy League). The Crimson saw its five game winning streak come to an end, however Harvard bounced back the following day with a dominant 100-83 victory against Brown.
HARVARD 100, BROWN 83
Coming off of a devastating loss at the hands of its conference rival, the Crimson went into its game against the Bears focused and motivated to secure a victory. Harvard’s leading scorer, junior guard Katie Benzan, addressed the team’s resilient mentality against Brown.
“We were very determined to get a win on Saturday,” said Benzan. “Our frustration and anger came out against Brown.”
The Wellesley native demonstrated this fierce mindset with her offensive explosion of 25 points, nearly surpassing her career high of 27 points. Senior captain Madeline Raster also had a strong contribution to the Crimson’s potent offensive attack with 20 points of her own. Raster alluded to the team’s assurance as a catalyst for its high scoring this game.
“Our team had a lot of confidence in our offense and felt good about our shooting against their 2-3 zone,” said Raster.
The Harvard offense flourished against the Bears with stellar play from sophomore forward Jadyn Bush and senior forward Jeannie Boehm, both of whom recorded double-doubles to help the Crimson on both ends of the court.
The game started out with neither team being able to get the edge over the other. There were six ties and four lead changes in the first quarter alone, as both teams’ offenses had great performances. Harvard’s four triples in the first quarter allowed the team to get out to an early 25-23 lead.
The game continued to be tight in the second quarter, as Brown rattled off seven straight points to start the period and had the lead for most of the quarter. Sharpshooter Katie Benzan would answer back with three straight triples to tie the game at 48-48 going into halftime.
The Crimson was able to pull away in the third thanks to a stalwart defensive performance where they held the Bears to only 10 points. Raster hit back to back triples to push the lead to double digits and the team entered the final frame with a 73-58 lead. Harvard continued their relentless offense in the fourth quarter to clinch the victory with a final score of 100-83.
YALE 65, HARVARD 62
The Crimson were in a back and forth affair for the majority of Friday’s game at the Lee Amphitheater. Their offense was clicking from the outset in a game that saw four Harvard players record double digit points. Jadyn Bush and Madeline Raster had 12 points apiece, while Jeannie Boehm and Katie Benzan contributed 11 of their own.
The teams traded baskets in the first quarter, with Yale having the lead for the majority of the period thanks to an early 5-2 run. Back to back triples from Raster and senior Sydney Skinner cut the deficit to one, to give the Crimson momentum heading into the second period
The second quarter was just as back and forth as the first, as there were four lead changes in the period alone. Harvard continued to rely on its balanced attack, led by Raster’s seven first half points. The team went into the half down 32-31, but plenty confident they would be able to continue their strong performance in the second half.
The Crimson defense led the charge in the third quarter holding the Bulldogs to only 11 points. The defensive efforts were led by Boehm who grabbed seven rebounds for the game. The offense was not as potent as it was in the first half, but was enough to keep Yale from stealing the lead for a majority of the second half.
The two teams continued to battle in a very tight game before Yale started to pull away with a seven point lead that came off of four straight baskets. Senior captain Madeline Raster did everything she could to prevent a Bulldogs win, by hitting two game-tying baskets in the final minute. Unfortunately, her efforts would not be enough, as Yale hit a buzzer beater at the end of the game to secure a 65-62 victory.
Following the game, Katie Benzan remarked on the team’s play down the stretch.
“We were very disappointed in Friday’s loss”, said Benzan. “We knew that we had that game in our hands and we just let it slip through.”
Next week, Harvard continues its road trip with back to back games at Columbia on Friday, and at Cornell on Saturday. Look for the Crimson to keep up their strong conference play on their way to an Ivy League Championship.

As a new semester rolls around, it’s time to sit back and truly evaluate your roommate situation. Regardless of whether you’re so close you literally sleep in the same bed (you should stop; that’s weird), or you haven’t seen your roommate since opening days, this quiz should help you make sense of who you’ve actually been living with for the past few months.
Rate the overall quality of your roommate(s):
1) LITERALLY MY FAVORITE HUMAN(S) EVER
2) I love them!
3) They understand my vine references, so we get along well enough.
4) I’m basically living with a stranger(s).
5) They’re actual poison. I demand a refund.
Does your roommate(s) have any annoying qualities? 
1) No, they’re perfect!
2) Sure, but I have the exact same ones!
3) Yes, but we communicate and that’s what’s important.
4) Yes, and it’s driving me crazy.
5) Yes, and I have a spare toothbrush at my friend’s dorm because of it, so I don’t have to go back to our room at night.
When your roommate(s) asks you to grab dinner in the Berg, you:
1) Don’t even reply (because *obviously* you’d be sitting together), and head to your usual table.
2) Reply immediately that you’d love to and you can’t wait.
3) Say yes, but only because none of your friends are free.
4) Lie and say you have homework, and then grab dinner with your friends in The Square so you don’t run into them.
5) This would never happen because you actually can’t stand each other.
Your roommate(s) doesn’t have plans for spring break and suggests you should go on a trip together. You:
1) Scream. You can’t believe they read your mind!! (Okay, actually you can)
2) Start looking for possibilities right after you two discuss the subject!
3) Are genuinely excited about the idea and ask if maybe a few of your other friends could join.
4) Say that you already have plans, but they’re welcome to join (you secretly hope they say no).
5) Say that you already have plans (you would NEVER travel with them) and avoid speaking about the subject.
Would you consider blocking with your roommate(s)?
1) Yes, we’re going to be together forever!
2) Yes, of course!
3) I’d consider it, but I’m not entirely sure if it’s a definite yes.
4) No, I wouldn’t want to live with them again.
5) I’d actually transfer to Yale if I was stuck with them for another three years.
Results:
Mostly 1s - Congrats! You and your roommate are practically married (although still in the honeymoon phase). In your eyes they can do no wrong. There’s a possibility you might be a little too obsessed, though. Remember, your roomie is only human!
Mostly 2s - Sweet! You lucked out with the roommate lottery. You and your roommate are simply meant for each other. Grab some markers and glitter and write a thank-you note to the Harvard Housing Gods.
Mostly 3s - You’re doing well. You and your roommate may not be best friends, but you don’t hate each other, and that’s what counts. This kind of roommate relationship lets you have your space when you need it, but still gives you someone to chat with when you’re lonely.
Mostly 4s - Uh-oh. Sounds like there’s some bad juju going on in your room. If you can’t stand your roommate, there’s a few ways to make it better. Try talking to them and expressing what’s bothering you so much, and maybe you can reach some sort of understanding. If communication doesn’t work, you can always look into switching. Or stick it out and get yourself a Canadaddy — who even needs their own room anyway?
Mostly 5s - YIKES. It’s time to call your dean! We don’t like to jump to assumptions, but we’re pretty sure your roommate is the devil incarnate. Try checking for horns tonight when they fall asleep.
