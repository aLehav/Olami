After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The scene outside Harvard Stadium before the Harvard-Duke lacrosse game was something that Crimson lacrosse hasn’t seen in years.
Free food, tailgating, and thousands of UC-purchased shirts littered the outskirts of the field, all part of an effort to act on the hype that had surrounded this matchup since Harvard upset the Blue Devils in its 2009 season opener, 9-6.
While the Crimson was enjoying the sensation surrounding the pregame festivities, Duke was all business, all night.
The Blue Devils scored five goals in less than five minutes to open the contest, making sure the game was over before those lingering fans who went back for seconds at the Redbones booth even found a place to sit. Duke added three more goals before the first quarter ended, leaving a Harvard crowd of more than 13,000 in shock that the Blue Devils had more goals—eight—than the Crimson had shots—five—in the first quarter alone.
The first quarter was all she wrote for Harvard as Duke would dominate ball control throughout the night en route to a 14-5 final tally.
[Duke’s] execution was great, and they came out ready to play,” Crimson coach John Tillman said. “I didn’t want us to play the scoreboard, and I think our guys really came together and rallied around the fact that it wasn’t going well, which is a good sign for the future.”
Despite the Blue Devil’s dominating first quarter, Harvard refused to cave in and simply hand over an easy victory.  After Freshman Peter Schwartz rifled one past Duke’s Dan Wigrizer for the first goal of his career, junior Dean Gibbons spun right around defenseman Jason Orlando and bounced one right into the bottom left corner of the goal to bring the deficit to 9-2.
Flashes of the Crimson’s incredible comeback from six down against Dartmouth last weekend were smothered when the Blue Devils scored the next three goals to take a 12-2 lead.  Sophomore Jeff Cohen found co-captain Travis Burr from behind the net for an easy goal to give Harvard a little bit of momentum heading into halftime down 12-3.
Duke was in complete command of the second half, content to work the ball slowly and rely on its defense to prevent the Crimson from developing any momentum.
“The most important thing for us right now is to keep coaching our guys, keep trying to make them better and making sure they know we improve as a team,” Tillman said. “I know they’ll stay together, and I’m sure we’ll come out ready to play much better next week.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When you think about softball, controversy is usually not the first thing that comes to mind. But this season, a new trend in officiating is drawing attention from players, coaches, and writers all over the country.
“Crow hopping” is a term often used to describe an illegal motion by the pitcher while she is throwing the ball. Some pitchers separate their foot from the rubber and move forwards as they’re throwing—against the official rule, which states that she must have her foot on the mound in order for the pitch to count. If the pitcher fails to adhere to the rule, the batter is awarded a ball, and any baserunners are advanced one base.
Harvard pitchers have been plagued with these calls this season, and some resulted in runs scored for the opposing teams. Against Boston University on March 25th, co-captain pitcher Margaux Black was called for six illegal pitches before being taken out for sophomore Julia Moore. Right away, Moore was also called for the same technicality, resulting in another run scored. BU lit up the Crimson in the first inning, scoring 11 runs—but not without help from the umpire.
Sophomore Rachel Brown, after pitching against Fairfield last weekend, shared some of her thoughts on the new trend of calling illegal pitches:
“The illegal pitch controversy is new this season. Basically, it’s just frustrating and unpredictable. The umpires are so inconsistent when they call it. We have a good pitching rotation, and we won’t let the umpires determine what we do.”
“What they’re calling me for is little technical violations of the rule. Before, the golden rule was that unless it gave pitchers a huge advantage, they wouldn’t call it. On TV, it seemed like some pitchers were really illegal in their pitching mechanics, so my guess is that this caused the umpires being firmer with the calls.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While Cornell may have become the Ivy League media darling with its recent success in men’s basketball and both men’s and women’s hockey, many in Cambridge haven’t been quite so enthused about the Big Red’s recent success.
Cornell’s success against the Crimson certainly hasn’t been making it any more popular.
But while the Big Red may have been the most dominating squad in the Ancient Eight recently, Harvard still reigns supreme on the water, as the No. 4 heavyweight men’s crew team swept the No. 11 Big Red today on Cayuga Lake Inlet.
The varsity eight, second varsity eight, freshman eight, and second freshman eight all crossed the line ahead of Cornell.  The third varsity eight finished two seconds behind the Big Red, but took the victory after Cornell was disqualified for interference.
While the Crimson’s success may not cancel out the heartbreak from losses in the aforementioned winter sports, Harvard’s success on the water signals the beginning of a new season, with the Ivy League once again wide open. And considering that the Big Red’s No. 6 men’s lacrosse team just fell to Dartmouth, it may be time for a new school to take control of the Ancient Eight.

The quick and dirty about what's been going on around the Ancient Eight (and some other schools too).
A Yale sophomore died last Sunday.  Andre Narcisse '12—an Exeter graduate and aspiring Economics concentrator of Haitian descent—dreamed of someday becoming a Wall Street executive. Yale police officials do not suspect foul play.  Yale College Dean Mary Miller told the Yale Daily News that it would be premature and inappropriate to speculate, but added she is hoping to address concerns about alcohol and drug use on campus.
A freshman at Princeton is suing the university during midterm season, after her request to receive extended time on exams because of her learning disabilities was denied. She argued that poor midterm exam grades freshman fall would cause her “irreparable harm.” FlyBy sympathizes but thinks she should chill out.
More after the jump.
Yale's business school has surpassed Harvard Business School in placing their students in full-time jobs within three months of graduation. It now stands at number one among the country's business schools. Penn's Wharton School, however, has suffered more, with only 83 percent of graduates securing full-time jobs, as opposed to 95 percent for the graduating years from 2005 to 2008.
Stanford stem cell researchers are poised to receive $52 million from California's stem cell research agency.
A 32-year-old horticulture graduate student at Cornell died unexpectedly.
And two Yale dining hall workers also passed away suddenly.

After Harvard students begged for dryness during last week's torrential downpours, water flow decreased not only from the skies, but also from an unexpected source as well—the water dispensers in the campus d-halls.
For the past few weeks, these machines—which provide cold water, room-temp water, and seltzer—have stopped functioning to continuously dispense your H2O. Previously, you could leave a glass under the running machine, fulfill another task, and then return to find your glass filled with no manual effort involved.
Now, students are now required to babysit their DAPA Nalgenes and keep one hand on the switch at all times in order to achieve a filled container with their choice of water.
Why the change? We at FlyBy thought there  may have been an epic story of a dining hall flood to blame,  or that the environmental  groups had decided to bring reform to water dispensing at Harvard.  Apparently, the modification came for a much less exciting reason.
“It was a temporary change made by the service  guy," wrote Crista Martin, HUDS Director for Marketing & Communications, in an e-mailed statement, "but they’re all going back to either/or."
This may be good news for all of the lazy students out there. But until then, here are some (potentially) exciting finger exercises to keep  you ready for the challenge of actually working to get your water.

ALISON SIMMONS, Samuel H. Wolcott  Professor of Philosophy
1. What time do you wake up in the morning?
Seven o'clock—that's different from when I get up, which is about eight o'clock. 
 
2. Who is your favorite Harvard alum, real or fictional?
My former students are my favorite alums, not the big famous people.
 
3. Was Larry Summers sexist? 
No.
4. Who is the smartest person you know? 
Leibniz—although to say I know him or understand his work is kind of a stretch...
5. What have you always wanted to tell tourists in the Yard?
Stop blocking the pathways. I don't mind the cameras, but when you can't get by and you have to step in the mud...  
 
6. What was your most recent CVS purchase?
A bag of Hershey's dark chocolate kisses last night to make cookies.  
 
7. Harvard Bookstore or Coop?
The Harvard Bookstore, of course! Unless it's for a cookbook or a travel book, in which case I'll go to the Coop.  
 
8. Where do you get your burritos?
I haven't in a while, but Felipe's.   
 
 
9. Who is the most interesting person you've passed on the streets of Cambridge?
I rubbed shoulders with Julia Child over the mushrooms at Whole Foods. [What kind of mushrooms were they?] They were just ordinary white button mushrooms—nothing exotic.
10. What's your neurosis? 
 I'm impulsive. Especially when it comes to ice cream. And cupcakes.
11. When's the last time you took the T?
About two weeks ago.   
 
12. Describe Harvard students in one word.
Fabulous.

Although a rocket-scientist-turned-local-politician may not be the typical American dream, it’s safe to say Leland Cheung is doing quite well for himself. In fact, the 32-year-old graduate student has quite the resume.
He became the first Asian-American elected to the Cambridge City Council in November last year and is concurrently pursuing a double degree at the MIT Sloan School of Management and the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. And before that, Cheung was a “rocket scientist” (that was actually his title) at Space Adventures, a Virginia-based company that sends private citizens into space.
But running local politics is quite different from studying outer space—a career shift that Cheung said was driven by his sense that the privatization of space travel was occurring too slowly. He began to get more involved with the community, volunteering at local church and neighbourhood organizations.
“I was so focused on the big picture that I was missing all these other opportunities to change the world at a more local level,” he recalled. “It’s important to realize what you do in your backyard has a really immediate impact.”
Cheung cites physicist Stephen Hawking, author of A Brief History of Time, as one of his biggest inspirations and likes to say that humans, like dinosaurs, could go extinct—a disaster that space exploration could somehow ameliorate.
In 2005, Cheung left the company—for which he had been promoted to Chief Information Officer—and moved to Boston, where he got involved with organizations like Big Brother Big Sister.
Cheung also has another accomplishment under his belt: he has been on the Daily Show with Jon Stewart. In a segment that aired on Aug. 12, 2009, Cheung appeared alongside several other MIT and Harvard grad students to discuss an ethics oath for MBA students. Check it out here.
