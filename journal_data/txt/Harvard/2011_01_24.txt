After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The worst recession since 1929 shattered American confidence in our economy and in our government. Global stock exchanges crashed, and the whole world lost its savings in the wreckage. Wall Street and Detroit teetered on the edge of insolvency, and Washington, when it finally realized the scale of a problem that had been brewing for years, reacted in panic.
As we attempt to reshape our politics and our badly sputtering economy, a good place to start looking for models would be a business most Americans—Tea Partiers and Marxists alike—consider a crucial part of our national identity: football. Despite the poor corporate climate, the National Football League continues to attract fans, rake in profits, and dominate the television market. Why? Because the NFL puts out a good product—entertaining games between well-matched teams—that people will pay to watch. Perhaps economists and policy-makers should take notice.  After all, if there’s anything more American than football, then by golly, it’s got to be capitalism. But the methods behind the success of the NFL might surprise many of its most loyal fans, given how loudly we proclaim our collective love of free markets and our corresponding disdain for their ever-encroaching enemy: European-style socialism.
By American standards, our football league is Red to the core: The league office sets a limit on how much each team can spend on its players and fines them heavily if they fail to comply. It divvies up the revenue from its gigantic television contracts equally between every team. It allows the visiting team to collect forty percent of the ticket sales at away games. All these regulations are explicitly designed to help teams from small-markets, like the Green Bay Packers, win Super Bowls alongside big-city rivals like New York and Dallas.
What’s going on here? Doesn’t it seem deeply un-American that the richest teams are forced to cap their spending? It’s their money; they earned it. Let them do what they want with it, not force them to give it away to less successful teams! How can Budweiser and General Motors, companies whose marketing departments make explicit the connection between owning their products and being a patriot, use this competition to hawk their beer and trucks? Why do we cheer wildly when our favorite team wins a league run like a European welfare state but lose our tempers about common-sense regulations on healthcare, pollution, and Wall Street? It seems like a glaring contradiction in our national psyche: We love our football league but hate the sensible policies that have made it so profitable.
Well, maybe it’s possible that the NFL isn’t so far to the left. I mean, imagine: If our favorite sport is run by little Lenins and imitation Trotskies, what must European football be like? Most likely every player, regardless of talent, is paid exactly the same salary, one mandated by some faceless bureaucrat in a tiny office in Brussels or Geneva, and the teams line up in alphabetical order to take turns winning the league title.
The reality is far different: In Europe, teams are allowed to spend whatever they want. There are no salary caps and revenues are not shared equally. And so, unlike the NFL and even Major League Baseball, where all but the most poorly-run teams have a shot at the championship each season, in Europe, the same three or four soccer clubs win the league trophy year after year. In England, for example, just three teams—Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea—have lifted seventeen of the last eighteen English Premier League titles. Pretty boring compared to America. In the same time span, twelve teams have won the Super Bowl, and eleven have captured the World Series.
But European soccer isn’t in danger of boring people or losing fans. Instead, it faces a financial catastrophe much like the one that took down so many of our banks and corporations, one caused by a boom of cheap credit, poor risk management, and a complete absence of effective regulation. With no financial watchdog, the European clubs borrowed heavily and sold themselves hastily to corporate raiders. With no spending limits, they used their inexhaustible lines of credit to spend obscene amounts on players who flopped or got injured and coaches whom they were forced to fire.
With their cheap credit and revenue streams drying up and interest rates sky-rocketing, all these teams are now in danger of collapse. Their irresponsible behavior demonstrates the superiority of the NFL’s insistence on limiting spending and economic disparity. And while the clubs’ global brands most likely will allow them to stay afloat, their days of wild spending appear to be over. Michel F. Platini, the president of European soccer’s governing body, seems to mean business. He has threatened any team that does not meet a salary cap and strict accounting rules with expulsion from the fabled European Champions League, an absolute cash cow for every club involved.
For the sake of soccer’s long-term health, let’s wish Mr. Platini luck as he attempts to turn his sport into Europe’s version of the NFL, in the process regulating one of his continent’s last Wild West markets. Let’s also hope that our own politicians and business leaders here in America turn more to the National Football League and less to Goldman Sachs as they attempt to restore civic and financial responsibility to America. Even if they have to use a little NFL-style socialism to do it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the nineteenth century, a common Western sobriquet for Africa was “the dark continent,” a reflection of the region’s social and economic delay. With fair reason, the label is no longer used—yet more than a century later, despite shaking off its colonial chains, Africa remains the world’s most underdeveloped continent.  But amidst poverty and stagnation, a glimmer of change has emerged in the movement for South Sudanese independence. Citing the alienation of a black minority from the Arab Muslim government in Khartoum, South Sudanese activists held an independence referendum on Jan. 9. Though votes are still being counted, preliminary results suggest nearly 99 percent of South Sudanese voters supported the referendum.
Despite some objections, South Sudanese independence would prove to be a positive development. At the very least, this change in sovereignty would advance the principle of self-determination, alleviate the problems of ethnic persecution and political suppression, and allow for a more equitable distribution of oil wealth. Ultimately, South Sudanese independence would also set a precedent for more natural borders and transparent governance in Africa, improvements that would benefit both citizens of African states and members of the international community.
First, South Sudanese independence would be an affirmation of the right of nations and peoples to self-determination. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, the world saw a shift in sovereignty from empires to self-determined nation-states, a process that continued after the fall of the Soviet Union. In general, the world community has supported this trend.
Yet, until now, South Sudan had missed the boat: As it stands, the region’s eight million, predominately black Christians and animists, live under the rule of an autocratic government by the Arab Muslim majority in the north. With the Sudanese government failing to satisfy the needs of the South Sudanese minority, self-determination could have the potential to establish a more effective government.
Second, independence would be a welcome antidote to the systematic persecution and political exclusion that blacks in South Sudan have faced under Sudanese rule. Throughout the 27-year civil war, crackdowns by the current Sudanese government against rebel activity led to the deaths of over 1.9 million people in South Sudan as well as the displacement of more than four million.
Meanwhile, South Sudan’s people have been politically alienated from the government in Khartoum. Authority is vested in a small clique of northern Arabs who rule in Khartoum, far removed from the marshlands of South Sudan. Accordingly, President Omar al-Bashir has imposed Islamic sharia law nationwide, making limited exceptions for largely non-Muslim regions in the south. Self-determination would be the natural way to allay this problem of representation.
Moreover, independence would allow for an equitable sharing of Sudan’s oil wealth. The U.S. Department of State reports that 70 percent of Sudan’s total exports earnings come from oil, with China emerging as the hungry primary consumer. In 2005, the framework for South Sudanese autonomy granted states in South Sudan an appreciable share of local oil revenues—a prospect that could only be helped by the establishment of clearer lines of sovereignty.
Ultimately, the new partition of oil wealth would serve not only to benefit the people of South Sudan but also the humanitarian situation in Darfur. At present, China provides a market for nearly all of Sudan’s oil exports. Concerned with maintaining Sudan’s market favor, China and other importers have, according to a Human Rights First report published in 2008, undermined international support for action against the Sudanese government’s genocide in Darfur. With oil divided about evenly between Sudan and a newly independent South Sudan, Khartoum’s leverage over international policy will wane, hopefully to the effect of stirring discussion about the ongoing carnage in Darfur.
Finally, South Sudan’s independence would foster a reassessment of African borders. Drawn up over a century ago by British, French, Portuguese, and Belgian imperialists, the borders of today’s African countries bear little relevance to ethnic and historical realities. A change in the contour of Sudan’s boundaries, if conducted peacefully, could create a paradigm shift of international support for unrepresented peoples around the world.
Though some argue that a redrawing of borders in Sudan would carry the risk of destabilization, it is difficult to imagine the country slouching any further toward poverty, stagnation, or war than it has already found itself under the status quo. Leaders of the movement have already welcomed international support, and promised a battery of treaties to prevent conflict with the north.
We can hope that as the window opens on South Sudanese independence, the dawn of a brighter, more prosperous Africa lies ahead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When The Crimson—then known as The Magenta—first appeared in 1873, all staff members voted on editorials, which is the procedure today. However, the reporters who broke the news every day were the same staffers who wrote the editorials; there was no separate editorial board. When The Crimson went daily, its editorial content became the express domain of its president, which lasted until 1911, when President Daniel Nugent, Class of 1911, established a separate editorial board, which has been a key fixture in the Harvard and local Boston community ever since. To be perfectly honest, it should be said that even in 1911 the Crimson’s higher executives had a much more influential voice when it came to staff editorials; by the mid-1930s, formal editorial meetings, open to the entire staff, were held regularly as they are today.
In the last one hundred years, The Crimson’s editorial board bore witness to a century that involved the greatest conflicts in human history, the rise of American supremacy, and explosive social revolutions right outside its headquarters at 14 Plympton Street. Given Harvard College’s changing demographics—and the quick turnover of the editors in charge—few generalities can explain our often inconsistent staff positions. However, a 1957 editorial articulates pretty well what can be said about the tradition of Crimson editorials past and present: Crimson editorials, the piece says, “say something about the need for imagination (and realism) in foreign policy, boldness (and gradualism) in domestic policy, and House-ification (and money) in University policy.” More or less, the same is still true today.
People often ask us why a university daily like The Crimson deals with events outside the Harvard community, and we respond that ever since Harvard became an institution involved in national and global affairs, The Crimson has, too. Of course, when the paper was first created, that was not the case. As Greg Lawless ’75 wrote in his 1980 history of The Crimson, “If, several centuries hence, the paper were to remain the sole document of the period 1873-1923, historians studying that period would come away with the distinct impression that the United States was largely a nation of sporting gentlemen who were concerned with their inadequate dormitories, boardwalks in their poorly drained school yards, the latest developments in the progress of football, track, and baseball teams, University teas, and the elegant abstractions of men named Eliot, Lowell, Norton, “Copey,” and Kittredge.” But with the dawn of World War I—and the subsequent conflicts that followed—Crimson editors began writing about the events outside of Cambridge that would shape their own futures and that of Harvard University. The tradition continues today.
Without further ado, we invite you to celebrate with us the unique history of The Harvard Crimson Editorial Board in its centennial year. Check back each month this semester as we retrace different aspects of Harvard history through the eyes of The Harvard Crimson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Paul F. Levy, the CEO of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center who announced that he would resign his position last week, will receive up to $1.6 million in severance pay over the next two years. The payout, which can be lowered if Levy takes a new job, is equivalent to two years of his annual base salary of $800,000.
Levy’s resignation comes in the wake of a $50,000 fine from the Medical Center’s board last May for hiring and promoting a female employee with whom he had an allegedly inappropriate relationship. At the time, the board called the situation a “serious lapse in judgment,” and concluded that it “created an improper appearance and became a distraction within the hospital.”
Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley’s office released a report in September about the incident, stating that the relationship endangered the hospital’s reputation and management. Coakley herself told the hospital board to do “some soul-searching” regarding keeping Levy on as the head of its management.
Stephen B. Kay ’56, Chairman of the Medical Center’s Board of Directors wrote in an e-mail announcing Levy’s resignation that it was part of a “negotiated settlement” the board had reached with Levy.
Levy took the helm at the Medical Center at a time of financial trouble in 2002, and has been credited with improving its financial situation.
“While I remain strongly committed to the fight for patient quality and safety, worker-led process improvement, and transparency, our organization needs a fresh perspective to reach new heights in these arenas.” Levy wrote in an e-mail message to the Medical Center community last week. “Likewise, for me personally, while it has been nine great years working with outstanding people, that is longer than I have spent in any one job, and I need some new challenges.”
Both Levy and the Medical Center board deny that Levy’s relationship had anything to do with his resignation.
Women’s groups hailed Levy’s departure as something a long time in the making. “The fact is, stepping down is the least he could do, but it comes very late in the game,” women’s rights lawyer Wendy J. Murphy told the Boston Herald.
While women’s groups have praised Levy’s departure, the severance pay decision has come under fire from unions, according to an article published today by the Boston Herald.
“The board should immediately rescind this agreement and return the money to the public charity,” Veronica Turner, executive vice president of Service Employees International Union Local 1199, said in a statement. According to the Herald, the union, which is the largest healthcare worker’s union in the state, is attempting to unionize some Medical Center workers.
After resigning his position at the hospital, Levy has changed the name of his personal blog to “Not Running a Hospital.” It used to be called “Running a Hospital.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A man was stabbed in the neck by an assailant in the vicinity of Brattle and Church Street around 11:25 p.m. on Jan. 2. Numerous witnesses were present and reported a detailed description of the suspect to the Cambridge Police Department, which quickly apprehended the suspect.
The suspect, Michael Prince, 24, was arrested for armed assault to murder. Prince, who lives in Cambridge, had previously been arrested for drug possession in 2009.
In addition to the stabbing, one unarmed robbery and several thefts were reported to the Harvard University Police Department in the past five weeks while students were away from campus. That number is a significant drop in the number of robberies and attempted robberies around Harvard’s campus since an increase in robberies and attempted robberies in the area during November.
On Dec. 22, HUPD officers responded to an individual riding a bicycle who had just stolen another individual’s bag. Officers arrested the individual riding the bicycle on Mill Street in front of Winthrop House after a brief foot chase.
There were also several reports of items being stolen from University buildings, including the athletic centers, during the past five weeks.
A theft occurred on Jan. 5 at Hemenway Gymnasium of an unattended ring valued at $5,000. Two Apple iPhones and a total of $50 in cash were stolen from locked lockers in the Malkin Athletic Center on Jan. 20. Another locker was tampered with but no items were taken.
Two Apple MacBooks were also stolen from the Loeb Drama Center on Jan. 15.
The number of robberies for the entire city of Cambridge between Jan. 1 and Nov. 29, 2009 and the same period in 2010 has decreased by 13.9 percent. More recent data is not available as the Cambridge Police Department has not yet released the BridgeStat crime data analyses—a monthly public report on crime, traffic, and disorder issues—for the month of December.
Another assault, which involved a man “struggling” with another male on JFK Street, occurred on Jan. 11. The individual alledgedly involved in the assault was later captured on Brattle Street by Cambridge police and HUPD.
According to the same November BridgeStat report, the number of aggravated assaults in Cambridge has remained the same for the period between Jan. 1 and Nov. 29 from 2009 to 2010.

The Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering will host its first undergraduate science competition this year, encouraging students to combine biology and nanotechnology to solve global challenges.
Announced in early January, BIOMOD 2011 is a “highly interdisciplinary” international bio-molecular design competition which will challenge students to engineer biological molecules that can assemble into nanoscale structures or systems capable of performing useful technological and scientific tasks, according to competition founder and Wyss Fellow Shawn M. Douglas.
Teams can register starting on Feb. 1 and will work on their projects throughout the spring and summer. Teams will be invited to present their final designs at the BIOMOD Jamboree at the Wyss Institute on Nov. 5. Teams must also produce a YouTube video and Wiki page to explain their projects.
The Wyss Institute brings together Harvard’s schools of Medicine, Engineering, and Arts and Sciences as well as clinical institutions from across Boston. Its research seeks to mimic natural processes to develop solutions to problems in fields as diverse as energy, robotics, and manufacturing.
Synthetic biology and DNA nanotechnology have high potential for “useful applications,” said Douglas, who said he founded BIOMOD to expose undergraduate students to the field.
“The nice thing about young students is they haven’t yet learned what’s not possible, so it’s true that if you come in from a fresh perspective you would be more willing to try things that a senior person has already dismissed,” he said.
He said he hoped the competition would also teach students how to work in a team and improve their communication skills.
Although they are required to have a faculty advisor, student teams will have an unusual amount of independence in the research process, said Adam H. Marblestone, a graduate student at the Wyss Institute and mentor of Harvard’s BIOMOD team.
“Working at the Wyss Institute will allow us to leverage every conceivable discipline that is relevant to our goal, and to learn these skills as a group when we need to,” Marblestone said.
Douglas said he expects at least ten different teams to participate this year.
“We should be able to grow pretty quickly to get more and more teams participating since the rules are pretty open ended,” he said. “I’m hoping that we can start seeing some exciting projects and ideas come out of the competition, which could hopefully seed and inspire further advances in the field.”

The Harvard Kennedy School will establish the Kenneth I. Juster Fellowship Fund to support students pursuing a master’s in public policy using a new $500,000 gift, the school announced last Thursday.
The Fellowship Fund will provide stipends to students specializing in international or global affairs seeking field or research experience during winter or summer breaks. Details about how students will be selected for the fund have not yet been released. The fellows will be funded to pursue work in areas such as international relations, international trade and economic affairs, international development and international negotiation and dispute resolution.
The Kennedy School hopes the Fellowship Fund will prompt rising young leaders to choose to pursue a master’s in public policy at Harvard by providing them with real-world experiences, according to the release. The first fellowships will be awarded in 2012 and will vary in size according to the type and scope of the project pursued by fellows.
The fund is endowed through a donation from Kenneth I. Juster ’76, the current managing director of private equity firm Warburg Pincus.
Juster earned a master’s degree in public policy from the Kennedy School prior to serving as Counselor of the U.S. State Department in the ’90s and as U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce from 2001 to 2005.
“One of my most valuable experiences while I was a Kennedy School student was the opportunity to work at the National Security Council in Washington, D.C., during the summer after my first year,” said Juster in a statement.
Juster added the Kennedy School had provided him with funding at the time, and that he was pleased to now get the opportunity to help students in a similar situation.
“I think it was pretty natural for him to follow [that path],” said Dean of the Kennedy School David T. Ellwood. “He knows that an understanding of international and governmental affairs is critical to our future.”
Ellwood added Juster has made significant contributions to the field of global affairs throughout his career.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 150 Cabot House community members gathered on Saturday afternoon to honor the memory of Cabot House Administrator Susan Livingston.
Livingston, who was serving her 28th year as house administrator, died on Jan. 11 in an electrical fire in her home at the age of 64.
Various speakers regaled the audience with humorous but moving anecdotes about the devoted friend and caring colleague who had been “snatched from [their] lives.”
Cabot House Master Rakesh Khurana greeted the crowd and spoke about the “mutually caring” community that Livingston created in the House.
Livington—a lover of cats, diet soda, and musical theater—was described as someone who could relate to the House’s “iconoclasts, the square-pegged, and the quirkiness among us.”
“Susan was Facebook before there was Facebook,” said Maura A. Henry, a longtime friend of Livingston. “She was the original social network.”
Many of the remarks addressed Livingston’s passion for theater and her role in founding the annual Cabot House Musical, which she directed and produced every year.
Katherine E. Kleeman ’74, who frequented the theater with Livingston, began her remarks by citing lyrics from Stephen Sondheim’s “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,” the 2009 Cabot musical.
“Tragedy tomorrow, comedy tonight!” she quoted.
Kleeman said that despite Livingston’s recurring health problems, she persevered in holding herself, others, and her musicals to her high expectations.
Outside of Cabot House, Kleeman and Livingston saw many shows together, from Broadway musicals such as “The Producers” and “Chicago” to smaller productions, including a musical about conjoined twins.
“I know my old theater buddy will be with me always,” Kleeman said.
Halfway through the ceremony, 14 House affiliates performed the closing number to “Guys and Dolls,” last year’s Cabot House musical, providing the audience with copies of the lyrics and encouraging them to sing along.
The former cast members also announced that the House musical, which Livingston started 19 years ago, will indeed perform this spring with “Annie Get Your Gun,” which Livingston had selected in the fall.
The memorial ceremony concluded with an a cappella performance of “Amazing Grace,” sung by Jordan A. Bryant ’11.

Data from the new pre-term planning tool has led College administrators to shuffle teaching fellows among some courses prior to the beginning of the term, but professors say the new tool has played little to no role in shaping their lesson plans.
Last November, undergraduates and first- and second-year students in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences were required to declare the courses in which they planned to enroll this spring through a new online system called pre-term planning.
The process, which is non-binding, is designed to prevent hassles during the first few weeks of the term—such as moves to larger classrooms, a shortage of textbooks at the Coop, and inappropriate numbers of teaching fellows—that have commonly arisen when courses received dramatically more or less enrollees than anticipated.
The number of sections that spring courses are budgeted for is determined in June, but after examining pre-term planning numbers in December the Office of Undergraduate Education adjusted some of those plans this year.
Given the novelty of pre-term planning, the College acted “very conservatively” when changing the number of sections assigned for a course, according to Assistant Dean of Undergraduate Education Katherine Stanton, who is supervising pre-term planning.
While Stanton declined to specify which courses were flagged as unexpectedly large or small, English professor Louis Menand said that his General Education class United States and the World 23: “Art and Thought in the Cold War” was among those affected.
Last year, Menand’s course boasted 263 students. This year, 140 students indicated through pre-term planning that they had plans to enroll in the course.
Menand said that once the College noted the projected decrease in class size, the General Education office notified him that his class would have fewer sections—and therefore fewer graduate teaching fellows—than it had been originally assigned.
“That meant going to the English department [and] figuring out where to reassign people,” Menand said. “I’ve had people work for me before who probably won’t be able to work for me again.”
Stanton noted that in some instances, she granted additional sections to classes which appeared to attract higher-than-anticipated interest.
Menand said that it was beneficial to the teaching fellows who were booted from his course that they were informed of their new placements earlier than they would have been without pre-term planning. “It’s better to do it now than to do it in February,” he said.
Despite seeing the new system as a boon for administrators hoping to improve the sometimes messy process of rearranging teaching fellow positions during the first few weeks of the semester, several professors said they were not interested to know the number of students who indicated a plan to enroll in the courses they are teaching this semester.
Professor of Islamic Art Gülru Necipoglu-Kafadar, who is co-teaching a new General Education class this semester, said that he had received the number of students who expressed intent to take his class in an e-mail. “I just deleted it,” he said. “I didn’t bother to read it.... I’ll teach it the same way if five or one-hundred people are there.”
Menand anticipated that students will not be deterred by the fact that they named tentative course choices in November from choosing different classes before official study cards are due.
“Harvard students—are you kidding? If they can shop, they’ll shop,” he said.

About thirty students boarded an unmarked, white van that they mistakenly thought to be a Harvard shuttle to the Quad Saturday night. Instead, they found themselves facing a driver demanding $5 per person before allowing them to disembark.
“He was never physically threatening, never rude,” said Lindsay M. Garber ’11, a passenger of the unmarked van. “We tried to remain as civil as possible.”
Garber said they eventually learned that the driver worked for a transportation company unaffiliated with Harvard. “He was just upset that it was this big miscommunication, and it was going to be his loss,” she said.
Passengers of the van said they were expecting the 10:10 p.m. shuttle from the Yard to the Quad.
After seeing the shuttle was significantly late, one student, a resident of Currier House who wished to remain anonymous due to the peculiar nature of the incident, called Shuttle Services. The operator reported that the shuttle was “three to four minutes away.”
About that time later, a shuttle arrived and students began filing in.
According to Abigail Brown ’11, a resident of Quincy House, the first passenger was reported to have asked, “Are you going to the Quad?” and the driver was reported to have responded, “Sure.”
The driver, who was not familiar with the bus routes, was directed to the Quad by one of the students, according to Brown.
“We thought he was a new driver,” she said.
But after arriving at the Quad, the driver asked the passengers to pay him $5 each for his services—though some confused passengers believed the driver was demanding a ransom.
The driver explained that he worked for a private charter company and would be fired if he did not return with the expected payment. After the students haggled with the driver—who was prepared to drive them back to the Yard in accordance with company policy—he finally agreed to let them leave the shuttle in front of the Student Organizational Center at Hilles. The students had given him around $10.
David E. Harris Jr., the general manager of Harvard Transportation Services, said he had not heard of the incident before The Crimson’s inquiry yesterday. He added that all Harvard vehicles have Harvard graphics on them and are operated by full-time employees wearing Harvard uniforms. He also confirmed that all shuttles in the Harvard fleet have digital destination displays.
Brown described the vehicle as having a similar appearance to the evening vans used at Harvard, though it did not bear Harvard markings.
Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano said the department was not notified about the incident, though one passenger said a blockmate in Currier reported it to a Currier security guard while the students were still aboard the van.

With a 15 percent spike in applications this year, the admissions rate to the College is poised to decrease to around 6 percent for the class of 2015, but Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said he believes it is unlikely that the College will experience another major increase in its number of applicants.
Citing the decreasing number of high school seniors and discouragingly low admission rates, Fitzsimmons said that “we may be reaching the end of these kinds of large scale increases”, such as the 5,000 more applications received between the admissions cycles for the classes of 2014 and 2015.
But admissions experts outside of the College disagree, saying that the ease with which students can submit college applications—through services like the Common Application, for example—will only continue to buttress the number of applicants to elite universities.
“I don’t see the 7 percent number as a sacred number,” said Washington D.C.-based private admissions consultant Steven R. Goodman, who said he believes that college admissions rates could continue to decrease and remain far below that percentage.
Don McMillan, president of the educational consulting firm Howland, Spence, & McMillan, said he believes that the Common Application—which allows students to apply to multiple colleges through a centralized, online form—is a major factor in the growth in college applications.
“The main thing that is keeping kids from increasing the number of applications from 6 to 11 is the supplement,” he said. “One way [colleges] will be able to moderate [the increase in applications] is by requiring additional supplementary essays or campus visits.”
While he said he believes it is too early speculate on the acceptance rate, Fitzsimmons said that the target class size remains the same for the class of 2015 as it did for 2014 and that the number admitted would probably not be “terribly dissimilar” from last year.
“We still have the same number of beds that we had before,” he said.
A lower acceptance rate is the logical result of more applications, according to University of Chicago spokesperson Jeremy Manier.
“It’s difficult to say exactly what the acceptance rate will be, but it’s safe to say that it will be lower than last year’s,” Manier said in reference to U. Chicago’s admissions rate. Like Harvard, U. Chicago has seen a similar upward trend in applications over the past few years.
The College received approximately 35,000 applications for the class of 2015 compared with approximately 30,000 the previous year. This dramatic increase follows the broader trend seen over the past decade, with the number of applications submitted increasing by approximately 15,000 since 2001.
Harvard’s acceptance rate has also declined, with a record-low of 6.9 percent for the class of 2014.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former CS 50 students packed Fong Auditorium yesterday to show off the crop of applications to emerge from Hack Harvard—an incubator for newly created applications that provided workspace, funding, and training during Optional Winter Activities Week for thirteen student teams to develop applications.
With names like EventPlz, pARTake, and CrimsonSpark,  students unveiled applications that do everything from romantically matching students with one another to connecting them with up and coming local artists.
The applications had been launched as final projects for Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I” and were further developed during the OWAW program.
“We upgraded security, made it scalable, able to expand to other campuses, and changed the search function,” said Ben L. Enowitz ’12 one of the co-founders of CrimsonSpark, a website designed to bring students together both romantically and platonically.
Christopher K. Lee ’13, co-founder of Harvard College Venture Partners, said the point of the program was to set a tone of innovation for the semester.
“There’s a huge energy at Harvard for launching businesses,” said Lee, whose organization was one of nine organizations that sponsored the programming event.
In addition to showcasing applications, three panelists—representing different sectors of the technological world—discussed the formula for a successful tech startup, such as creating a popular application, finding the right people when creating a company, and marketing.
“Everything that students are working on right now is really valuable. You shouldn’t be afraid to try and fail, because what you make could be really successful,” said Cort E. Johnson, one of the panelists and “Chief Evangelist” of SCVNGR—a location-based game where people can participate in challenges and earn points.
But for Alex Taussig, a partner at venture capital firm Highland Partners, the formula for a successful application is simple.
“It’s all about the ego and laziness,” Taussig said.

Last year’s seniors panned the economics and government concentrations in the annual exit surveys completed in May, while the English Department ranked first in satisfaction among the largest concentrations.
The 2010 senior survey, compiled by the Office of Research and Analysis in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, was distributed to the Faculty earlier this month and obtained by The Crimson this weekend.
Despite their low scores, economics and government—the two largest concentrations in the College—followed a FAS-wide trend of improving survey scores since the beginning of the decade.
Economics and government received scores of 3.72 and 3.92 respectively in a five-point satisfaction scale, below the 4.18 mean among the 38 FAS concentrations with more than six respondents.
But both departments rose nearly half a point since 2002, the earliest year cited in the report.
Other large concentrations fared better while displaying similar improvements since 2002. History and psychology both ranked just below the mean, while Social Studies received a 4.33­­—the highest score among the five largest concentrations.
English, which improved from 3.94 to 4.34 between 2002 to 2010, ranked the highest in concentration satisfaction for departments over 50 students.
English administrators and concentrators said that its high rating is primarily due to departmental reforms in 2009.
“I don’t want to sound overconfident, but one obvious reason is the new curriculum,” English Department Chair W. James Simpson said. “It has four distinct aspects: new common ground courses, much smaller classes, more electives, and a new advisory system that allows much closer access with students.”
The English department’s reforms are part of a broader movement to re-engineer existing departmental advising models across FAS.
The economics department overhauled its advising structure last year, while government continues to tweak an advising model that has been revamped over several years.
In an e-mail to the English department community, Simpson listed a series of high marks found in the concentration survey.
Satisfaction ratings doubled in departmental advising, intellectual excitement, quality of instruction, and overall satisfaction, Simpson wrote.
“I congratulate each constituency of the department on this remarkable result, and look forward to building on these figures as we move forward,” Simpson wrote in his e-mail.
English concentrators also praised the recent changes—such as small-sized “common ground” courses that explore literary themes—saying that the reforms increased face time between students and professors.
The small classes have proven beneficial: satisfaction for class discussion nearly tripled.
“I’m very satisfied. It’s a great concentration. It allows you to pursue your interests,” Lynnette Cortes ’11 said. The reforms have made the concentration “more personalized,” she said. “We get more attention from faculty and advisors.”
“The English classes have been the best classes I’ve taken here at Harvard,” Cortes said.
Other large concentrations that scored above the mean included neurobiology, History and Literature, and Social Studies.
Among all concentrations at the College, History of Art and Architecture and Earth and Planetary Sciences ranked top in concentration satisfaction with a perfect five rating. Engineering Sciences, a growing concentration, was at the bottom of the list with a 3.45 rating.
Smaller departments generally performed well in both categories. The six top-ranked concentrations all had fewer than 20 respondents.

It certainly was not the Harvard men’s basketball team’s strongest performance of the year, but it was enough to earn the victory.
The Crimson (13-3, 2-0 Ivy) rallied from a 12-point second-half deficit to grab a 59-50 win against Dartmouth (4-12, 0-2) Saturday afternoon at Lavietes Pavilion.
Harvard, which trailed 40-28 with 15:36 remaining in the game, went on a 23-2 run over the next 12:38 of play to take a nine-point lead. The Crimson’s lead never dipped below five for the remainder of the contest, and Harvard finished with a nine-point victory against a Big Green squad picked to finish at the bottom of the Ivy League.
The win marks the Crimson’s sixth straight victory and its 11th straight at Lavietes Pavilion—tying a program record.
“I thought that we showed a great deal of toughness and grit to be able to dig one out when it wasn’t necessarily going our way,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “Things weren’t as easily flowing for us as they had been.”
After jumping out to a 15-8 lead to open the contest, the Crimson fell cold on offense and started to surrender open looks to Dartmouth on defense.
The Big Green, which entered the contest shooting a conference-worst 38 percent from the field, capitalized on its early opportunities, knocking down three straight treys to take a 17-15 advantage 10 minutes in.
After back-to-back turnovers from Harvard freshman Matt Brown and junior co-captain Oliver McNally, Dartmouth’s Jabari Trotter sank a baseline jumper to make it 19-15.
Minutes later, Big Green forward Matt Labove extended his team’s lead to six, sticking a jumper from just inside the perimeter.
“Dartmouth came out confident and hit a lot of shots,” McNally said. “You have to give credit to them, but we weren’t playing good defense.”
After freshman Laurent Rivard pulled the hosts within four thanks to a pair of free throws with six minutes to play in the first half, the Crimson switched to a matchup zone for the first time on the afternoon.
The zone proved effective, as Harvard came up with stops on Dartmouth’s next five possessions and pulled within one, 25-24.
“That was a big thing for us to be able to change the rhythm,” Amaker said of the switch to zone. “I thought we did a better job of communicating and getting matched. We don’t use it a lot, but we practice it in case we need it, and certainly we thought we needed it this afternoon.”
But the Crimson was unable to even the score, as the Big Green closed out the half on a 7-2 run to take a six-point lead into the break.
Dartmouth picked up from where it left off to start the second frame, opening with an 8-2 run capped by a corner three from R.J. Griffin.
Griffin’s three, which came with 15:36 left on the clock, marked the Big Green’s 40th point of the contest. Dartmouth scored just two points over the next 13:02 and 10 points throughout the remainder of the contest.
Crucial to Harvard’s defensive success was the switch back to the matchup zone and the play of Brown, a 6’3” point guard.
After seeing limited action in the Crimson’s first 14 contests, the rookie played significant minutes Saturday afternoon filling in for the injured Christian Webster—who missed Saturday’s matchup with a hip injury.
Brown was a key factor in 15 minutes of play, particularly on the defensive end, where he picked up a team-high three steals.
“I thought Matt Brown came in and gave us a great shot in the arm defensively,” Amaker said. “It was nice to see him step forward with a few shots, but his presence, his defense, and his toughness out there were a big key for us.”
“I think Matt Brown came off the bench and really had a sense of urgency in the way he played,” McNally echoed. “He gave a spark that nobody else was giving. I honestly believe without him, we would have lost.”
Brown’s classmate and former high school teammate at Northfield Mount Hermon School, Laurent Rivard, began the process of chipping away at the visitor’s lead.
Rivard got a tough layup to fall, and then, following two free throws from McNally, sank a three from the right corner.
Two possessions later, Brown pulled the home team within two, drilling a trey off an extra pass from Rivard.
David Rufful put his team back up by four with a midrange jumper, but Harvard used the charity stripe to continue its assault on Dartmouth’s lead.
Four straight free throws from sophomore Brandyn Curry evened the score with 7:22 to play. The Crimson took the lead moments later, when Curry cut to the lane and dumped off a pass to junior co-captain Keith Wright, who finished with a two-handed slam.
Two free throws and a deep ball from McNally and a layup from Curry over the next three minutes of play made it 51-42 Harvard with 2:58 to play, and Harvard cruised to the victory.
“I was pretty disappointed with the way we came out, and that falls on Keith and my shoulders,” McNally said. “With that said, it showed a lot that we were able to turn it loose at the end. That was pretty impressive, but that’s got to be a forty-minute thing. You can’t play 10 minutes of good basketball.”

Two weeks ago, a 2-1 loss at the hands of Rensselaer doomed the Harvard women’s hockey team to a record below .500. Friday night’s rematch at the Bright Hockey Center culminated in the same score, but this time, the outcome granted the Crimson its ninth win overall and second place in the standings.
Harvard (9-7-2, 8-3-2 ECAC) survived a late surge by the Engineers (9-9-6, 7-5-1 ECAC) in the game’s waning moments to come up with its third straight win over an ECAC opponent. The Crimson went up 2-0 early in the second period, a cushion that RPI couldn’t overcome, despite the Engineers’ score midway through the third frame.
Harvard tri-captain Liza Ryabkina provided the team’s first goal, while rookie forward Kalley Armstrong snuck the puck past RPI goaltender Sonja van der Bliek for the second tally.
“We came out flying,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “We could have buried them early; [van der Bliek] did well but she had a lot of luck, too. It could have easily been three, four, or five [goals]. It’s unfortunate because we made it close, and they’re a good team, and if we let them hang around, anything can happen.”
After dominating the first two periods, it seemed that the Crimson would run away with the win. The game started looking grim for Harvard three minutes into the final frame, though, as senior forward Katharine Chute was called for a hooking penalty. Thirty seconds later, the officials caught freshman defenseman Marissa Gedman tripping a player, leaving Harvard with a 5-on-3 situation—the second of the contest in Rensselaer’s favor.
It was the Engineers’ best power play of the game, producing six shots in the three-and-a-half-minute span. The Crimson managed to kill the power play but couldn’t hold off RPI’s eventual score.
With 11:35 left to play, the Engineers’ Alisa Harrison skated across the ice to blast a shot at sophomore goaltender Laura Bellamy. The puck ricocheted off Bellamy to the right and found opposing forward Jordan Smelker, who slid it past Bellamy while she was still down on the ice.
The defensive lapse shifted the momentum to Rensselaer, a team desperate to find the equalizer. Seven of the matchup’s final eight shots belonged to the Engineers, but Harvard maintained its defensive stance till the end to preserve the one-goal margin.
“[I told my team] to just keep it simple,” said Stone of the final minutes of the game. “Make smart plays and manage the game and the pressure. Don’t stand still and keep yourselves moving. We’re a young team that has to get used to handling pressure, and we did.”
The Crimson outshot RPI, 29-20, but through the first two periods the shots total was lopsided, 25-10, in Harvard’s favor.
After the first power play of the game—granted to Rensselaer with 17:10 left in the first period—it became clear that the home side would be the team to beat.
The Crimson constantly frustrated the Engineers by breaking up the flow of their passes despite the man-advantage RPI possessed. The visiting team mustered one shot during the power play, and it took another 10 minutes before the Engineers could get another look on goal.
Meanwhile, Harvard had eight shots in that span and finished the first period outshooting RPI, 12-5.
It seemed like Rensselaer came out from intermission determined to get some momentum on its side, especially with a 5-on-3 advantage to start the second period. Forward Taylor Horton released a shot on Bellamy a minute into the power play, but that would be the only shot the team could muster in the sequence.
At the 2:53 mark, sophomore forward Jillian Dempsey, skating down the left flank, provided Ryabkina with a behind-the-back, no-look pass. The tri-captain carefully placed the puck past van der Bliek into the bottom right corner of the net for the first score of the game.
With 14 minutes remaining in the frame, sophomore forward Whitney Kennedy weaved her way past a right defender and dished the puck across the ice to Armstrong, who found a tight angle to slip the puck past the goaltender.
“We executed better [Friday],” tri-captain Kate Buesser said. “I think we were able to use our breakout a lot better than we did in the first game [against RPI], and I think we were just all over them offensively. It was really important to get quality shots on their goaltender and attack the rebounds, and I think we did a good job of that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When it comes to academics, the Ivy League’s standing is unquestioned. This weekend, the Harvard and Brown track and field teams proved they could top the competition in athletics, too.
In its first indoor home meet of the year, the Crimson teamed up with the Bears to face off against Army and Colgate in an Ivy League-Patriot League showdown on Saturday afternoon at the Gordon Indoor Track. The Ancient Eight representatives downed the Black Knights and the Raiders, 193-121, becoming the champions of the first-ever Harvard Challenge.
“I thought it was going to be a good challenge for us,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “Historically, Army has been a deep and talented team, and I thought being paired up with Colgate would make them a formidable opponent. It was a great start to the season.”
Harvard’s long-distance program stood out considerably over its Patriot League opponents. The Crimson cleaned up in the men’s 3000-meter run, in which senior Dan Chenoweth came out of the blocks flying and finished in 8:17.21, over seven seconds ahead of junior Christian Escareno from Brown.
Freshman Maksim Korolev and junior Darcy Wilson also helped out the Crimson, coming in third and fourth place, respectively.
Kristina Funahashi was the only Crimson runner to compete in the women’s 3000-meter run, which she won. Like Chenoweth, she finished over seven seconds ahead of her Colgate and Army competitors, crossing the finish line in 10:11.06.
In the men’s 1000-meter run, freshman Erik Kraus took home first for Harvard in 2:31.66, besting classmate Ryan Romain, who came in second in 2:31.77.
Freshman Peter Dolan wasn’t far behind, as he secured Harvard’s dominance in the race with a third-place time of 2:32.23. It was the Crimson’s best finish of the meet.
The women’s 5000-meter run turned out to be a Harvard-Colgate faceoff, with the Crimson coming out on top. Junior Kirsten Jorgensen and sophomore Stephanie Barnett went one-two in the race, earning the maximum number of points for their squad in the event.
Harvard also was dominant in the medley and relay events, sweeping the two distance medleys and winning the women’s 4x400-yard relay.
Juniors Robbie Paris and Brian Paison teamed up with freshmen Paul Koullick and James Leakos to win the men’s distance medley in 10:21.85, just under two seconds ahead of the squad from Army.
In the women’s distance medley, the Crimson blew its competitors out of the water. Co-captain Thea Lee, senior Hilary May, junior Lauren Leon, and freshman Natalia Paine finished in 12:06.94, almost a full minute ahead of second-place Army.
In the 4x400 relay, juniors Shannon Conway and Magda Robak and freshmen Christina Twicken and Meisha Brooks teamed up to take home another victory.
“I think that both relays we were very confident to put up a really good performance,” Lee said. “We were pleased with how the results turned out. For the 4x400, especially, I think it was exciting to see them run so fast so early in the season.”
The women’s squad also proved to be formidable opponents in the short-distance events. Twicken won in the 200-meter dash, and Brooks and Robak took first and second in the 500-meter dash.
Freshman Olivia Abbate easily finished with the best time in the preliminaries for the women’s 60-meter hurdles, but her opponent, freshman Susan Scavone of Brown, turned up the heat in the final event and took first, leaving Abbate to settle for silver.
“The nature of track and field is that you’re always looking to improve and get better,” Saretsky said. “Even when you win races, you want to do it just a little bit better. We’ve certainly got a lot of work to do before we take on some of the other teams this season, but we’re excited about it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s hockey team gave its audience of Olympic alumnae all that they could have wanted to see from their former team.
From breakout goals scored by new faces to senior leadership and shutdown defense, the Crimson (10-7-2, 9-3-2 ECAC) brought a little bit of everything to Bright Hockey Center on Saturday in its 4-0 win over Union (1-22-3, 1-12-2).
Everything, that is, except for penalties.
Just a day after allowing Rensselaer seven power plays, Harvard posted its first penalty-free outing of the season.
“In the past few games, we’ve been getting a lot of penalties,” tri-captain Liza Ryabkina said. “I think we kind of stepped back a little bit from it and tried to keep our feet moving and playing a little bit less physically, which has helped us out a lot to stay out of the box.”
The Crimson’s discipline allowed it to keep the Dutchwomen from gaining any offensive momentum. Only rarely was Harvard sophomore netminder Laura Bellamy threatened, and the Crimson’s ability to stay on the ice enabled it to apply constant pressure to the Union defense and keepers Alana Marcinko and Kate Gallagher.
Harvard was rewarded for its persistence with two goals on Marcinko in the first ten minutes of play. Sophomore defender Kelsey Romatoski notched the first off a shot from the blue line that rifled through a gathering at the goal to put the Crimson up five minutes into the game. Romatoski’s goal, her first of the season, would prove to be the game-winner. Freshman defender Jackie Young was credited with the assist.
Three minutes later, it was two of Harvard’s regular suspects, Ryabkina and sophomore Jillian Dempsey, who combined to find the back of the net. Dempsey’s goal at 8:47 into the first period led to the benching of goaltender Marcinko by Union coach Claudia Asano ’99, a former Crimson athlete and assistant coach. Gallagher subsituted in for Marcinko and played the remainder of the game, registering 25 saves.
Yet, despite the early goals, Harvard was dissatisfied with its play in the early minutes.
“In the first period, we were a little shaky,” Ryabkina said. “We didn’t really come out strong.”
But the Crimson’s shakiness wasn’t reflected in the stats: Harvard finished the frame with a 10-1 shot advantage and a 2-0 lead.
In fact, statistically, the first period was the Crimson’s most dominant. In both the second and third frames, Harvard outshot the Dutchwomen by six shots, compared to nine in the first period.
In the second and third periods, Union was often able to foil the Crimson’s offensive ambitions.
“I thought they did a good job defending what we were trying to do,” Stone said. “They definitely had watched some tape and made some adjustments, and it worked for them.”
But though the Dutchwomen played solid defense, they were not able to mount an offensive threat. Harvard’s defensemen were often able to steal the puck before it got far past the blue line. On the few occasions when Union was able to get off a shot on goal, Bellamy was there to make the saves.
“Those are hard games to play,” Stone said. “For goaltenders, it’s a lot easier when you get a lot of shots, and so she needed to mentally stay locked in. I thought she did a real good job, because they had a couple good chances down the stretch, and she’s playing solid. She’s doing what she needs to do, and everybody in front of her is working and doing their jobs, and that’s what it’s all about.”
With its offense unable to help, Union’s defense broke down at the hands of a trio of Harvard freshmen. Elizabeth Parker started the play by securing the puck and sending it to Kalley Armstrong. Armstrong hooked the puck to an open Gina McDonald in front of the goal. McDonald cashed in on the play for the first goal of her college career.
“Whenever someone gets her first collegiate goal, it’s always a big deal, and she works so hard that we were all just so excited for her,” Ryabkina said.
The game’s third goal, which came 17 minutes into second period, also gave Parker her first assist as a college athlete.
With the outcome secured, tri-captain Kate Buesser added her own flair to the game’s final goal, which came six minutes into the third period. Seemingly heading away from the goal, Buesser fired a quick shot past an unsuspecting Gallagher to set the margin at four goals.
The forward’s goal was the final touch on what was a dominating weekend for the Crimson.
“It’s obviously awesome to win, especially when it’s alumnae weekend and everybody’s back,” Romatoski said.
But three Harvard hockey alumnae were probably not as pleased as the rest with the Crimson’s easy win over the Dutchwomen. Those three were Union coaches Asano, Ali Boe ’06, and Julie Chu ’06-’07.
Chu, an Olympic medalist and winner of the Patty Kazmaier award, was honored in between periods along with Harvard’s other Olympic alumnae.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After spending a week in Puerto Rico, followed by a week in the blizzards of Boston, the men’s swimming and diving team was poised to get back into the racing season—and it showed. Heading into the weekend with a 3-0 record in the Ivy League, Harvard first faced Brown University on Friday, defeating the Bears 190—104. Two days later, the squad took on the University of Pennsylvania, winning 197-103. Its perfect record intact, the Crimson (7-0, 5-0 Ivy) sits at the top of the league standings going into the historic Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet next weekend.
“I think that this season we’ve just been able to improve over and over from one meet to the next,” senior Jamie Mannion said. “I think it’s going to be a great meet next weekend. We’re going to do what we need to and swim smart.”
HARVARD 197, PENN 103
Yesterday, Mannion and the seven other seniors of the squad celebrated their last dual meet at Blodgett Pool with the accompaniment of friends, family, and the Quakers. Beginning with the 200-yard medley relay, both squads started out strong as the first-place finisher from Penn edged out Crimson junior Rob Newell by 0.7 seconds. But Harvard jumped out in the second event, grabbing the top-three positions in the 1000-yard freestyle. Freshman Wes Stearns took the lead from the start, followed by senior Blake Lewkowitz, and freshman Chris Satterthwaite.
“I’d say our freshman class has really stepped up a lot, especially Satterthwaite, Danny Crigler, and Stearns. They’re all coming on really strong at the end and really bringing the team together,” Lewkowitz said. “It’s really inspiring for me to watch as a senior, remembering what I was like freshman year. It’s fun to know that the legacy will continue after the seniors are gone.”
The Crimson finished one-two-three again in the 100-yard freestyle event with Sattherwaite taking the top spot in 45.48, followed by senior Will Heyburn and junior Niall Janney.  Not to be outdone, junior Rob Newell, seniors Douwe Yntema and Michael Dunn, and sophomore Brendan McIntee finished ahead of their Quaker competition in the 200-yard backstroke, giving the Crimson 18 points in that race alone.
Harvard had a chance to grab another top-three finish in the 200-yard individual medley, but Penn’s Brendan McHugh came from behind to edge out sophomore Owen Wurzbacher in a neck-and-neck race for the top spot with a time of 1:53.14.
“Penn was a great meet since it was home, and we had all of our parents here, and it was our senior meet,” Mannion said. “Just the energy in the place here was really good today.”
The diving team saw similar success with freshman Joe Zarrella, sophomore Michale Stanton and senior Zac Ranta dominating both the 1-meter and 3-meter events. Zarrella placed second in the 1-meter diving—followed by Stanton and Ranta—and in the 3-meter event, Stanton took second, followed by Ranta and Zarella.
Ranta didn’t just dive against Penn, though. In the final event of the day, the 200-yard freestyle relay, Ranta joined seniors Will Heyburn, Jamie Mannion, and Douwe Yntema in one of the two senior relays that placed third and sixth.
“Zac, he’s a good swimmer—we’ve always said it,” Lewkowitz said. “He split at 23.5, which for a swimmer is fine, so it’s fun to have him and incorporate him as much as we can, because he’s a great leader on the team and a real great friend.”
HARVARD 190, BROWN 104
Two days prior, the men’s swimming team saw similar success with four one-two-three results. But for the Crimson, the 12 first place finishes weren’t nearly as exciting as the electrical problems at the Seekonk High School pool.
“The Brown meet was a lot of fun, actually, because in the mile race the lights went out halfway through, so we swam the rest of the race in the dark,” Lewkowitz said. “It was strange. I mean, you couldn’t really see anything, but the officials had lanterns to walk up and down the pool. I’m at least happy to have Blodgett, where that stuff doesn’t happen.”
“It was awesome,” said Mannion who also swam in the event. “I stopped and I had to fix my goggles because I couldn’t see anything in the darkness, but everyone kept yelling to go, so I decided to finish the race in the dark, which was fun and something I’m always going to remember.”
Lewkowitz finished second in the event behind freshman Satterthwaite while Mannion finished fourth. In the 200-yard relay race before, all three Harvard teams finished ahead of their Brown counterparts, while later in the 100-yard butterfly junior Rob Newell finished ahead of freshman Jack Pretto and sophomore Ryan Cutter for another three-peat.
“It was a good weekend for the team, two big wins—convincing wins—getting ready for HYP next weekend,” Lewkowitz said. “We have a lot of ground to cover until Ivies. We’re definitely the underdogs right now, but the way we’ve been training, the way we’ve been swimming, I’m expecting some good things to happen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A sea of change has come to the Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association, but Harvard seems unaffected by its ripples. After winning the past two carnivals, the University of Vermont has replaced Dartmouth as the top squad in the East. The Crimson, meanwhile, finished the Colby Carnival in ninth—its standing for the entire 2010 season.
But while Harvard’s overall results may not be turning heads, two skiers—freshman Rebecca Nadler and sophomore Alena Tofte—are proving themselves to be some of the region’s best.
Nadler followed up last weekend’s fourth-place finish with another strong performance in the giant slalom, finishing sixth this weekend. Tofte placed eight in the 10k classic race for the best finish of her career.
“I was pretty happy with how I did Friday,” Nadler said.
Last weekend, Nadler’s performance paved the way for a fourth-place team finish in the event.
But this weekend at Sugarloaf, her top-10 showing proved to be a bright spot in what was otherwise a disappointing finish for the women’s alpine team. Nadler was the only Harvard skier to successfully complete both runs in the giant slalom.
All of the Crimson’s skiers successfully completed both events in the slalom, but the team still finished in ninth.
“Unfortunately, we had some trouble finishing,” Nadler said. “The result wasn’t what we were hoping for, but we still have a lot of potential to get better.”
The men’s alpine team placed 10th in both of its events, but Nadler pointed out that the nature of alpine skiing makes it hard for skiers to move up in the rankings.
Because of their school’s low seeding, she said, Harvard’s men are consistently forced to start later in the day, when the snow is the worst.
“I think it’s really tough starting at the back,” Nadler said. “No one questions how hard [the men] work...I think everyone’s working really hard. The work is there; the results are going to come.”
Tofte, whose performances have consistently improved since her freshman season, was another highlight in the team’s showing.
“She’s been fast all season,” said Nordic coach Chris City ’94. “I think that’s a good demonstration of what she’s capable of...she’s got more of those to come, I hope.”
Tofte and her fellow Nordic skiers competed on a different course than anticipated because the weekend’s weather rendered the original course unsafe. The change may have been advantageous for Tofte and freshman Chris Stock, who placed 17th in the men’s race.
“Chris and Alena tend to do well on courses that have more gentle climbing,” City said. “It was a good course for them, and they made the most of it.”
Tofte was resiliant despite difficult terrain on the course.
“That’s definitely Alena’s career race,” City said. “She did a good job of not letting the conditions bother her. She just put her head down and went.”
That tenacity carried into the final kilometer of the 10k race, when Tofte passed several racers in the final stretch.
“Everybody gets tired at the end of races,” City said. “She managed to find a little bit of strength...She was racing really hard right to the end.”
The rest of the Nordic squad was unable to match the successes of Tofte and Stock.
The women finished tied for sixth in the 10k classic and ninth in the 3x6.6k free relay, while the men placed seventh in the 10k classic and 11th in the relay.
“Our relays didn’t go well,” City said. “I think we panicked early and dug ourselves into a hole and weren’t able to dig ourselves out of it.”
But City added that a freshman Jen Rolfes, competing for the squad’s “B” entry, had a noteworthy race.
“Jen Rolfes had probably one of her better races of the season,” City said. “I put her on the B team, but she skied well enough to be on the A team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s hockey seemed to have full control of Friday night’s game against No. 13 Rensselaer, as the Crimson (3-15-0, 2-11-0 ECAC) outpaced the Engineers (15-6-3, 7-5-0) by generating 38 shots to RPI’s 16.
Despite the advantage, Harvard could not convert its chances and fell, 3-2, to the Engineers at Houston Field House in Troy, N.Y.
“We went in the game hoping to shoot everything,” co-captain Chris Huxley said. “We did. I think it paid off a little, and we just got to stick to that.”
Other players did not return repeated requests for comment.
The contest began as a defensive battle with only 13 shots taken in the first period. At the 13:31 mark, Patrick Cullen put RPI on the board after beating senior goaltender Kyle Richter, who had 14 saves on the night.
Crimson co-captain Michael Del Mauro then evened up the game with less than a minute left in the period.
The unassisted goal came after Del Mauro took advantage of an Engineer error by stealing the puck from goalie Allen York in the RPI zone. The senior forward then wrapped around the net to finish the opportunity.
The mistake by York was one of few he made on the night. The goaltender stopped 36 shots and helped the Engineers kill seven out of eight Harvard power plays.
The second period belonged to Chase Polacek, RPI’s star forward. The senior, who was the 2010 ECAC Player of the Year, scored two goals in the period.
The first came at the 2:00 mark after Polacek received a pass from Nick Bailen and ripped a top shelf shot that zoomed past Richter’s outstretched glove.
Polacek then put the Engineers up 3-1 a minute and a half later. The goal-scoring play began when Alex Angers-Goulet created a turnover at center ice, allowing Polacek to skate free into the Crimson zone.
After receiving a pass from Brock Higgs, Polacek beat Richter for his fifth game-winning goal this season—the most in the NCAA.
“You can’t really change an entire game plan for one player,” Huxley said. “But you just got to know when he’s on the ice. You got to keep an eye on him.”
Down 3-1, Harvard needed a strong third period effort. The Crimson delivered, outshooting RPI, 18-3, in the final frame.
Harvard edged closer to the Engineers with a goal from senior Pier Olivier-Michaud at the 6:22 mark.
The score came during a 5-on-3 Crimson power play, which had resulted from RPI interference and cross checking penalties. Michaud put away a rebound that came off a shot taken by sophomore Danny Biega.
“We played a much better game [against RPI] than we had in the past—getting pucks in deep, forechecking, playing a full game,” Huxley said.
The Engineers committed five penalties in the third period, giving Harvard control of the game’s flow.
The Crimson showed impressive discipline during the contest, committing one penalty, but Harvard went just 1-of-8 on its power plays.
Last season, the Crimson found itself in a similar situation against RPI. Down 3-1 in the third period on Jan. 23, Harvard climbed back and tied the game with three seconds remaining.
Trying to recreate last year’s result, the Crimson pulled Richter to create a 6-on-4 power play in the final seconds of the game, but Harvard could not get the puck past York for a game-tying goal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its third game in four days, Harvard (3-15-0, 2-11-0 ECAC) gave No. 10 Union all it could handle.
But a goal with less than three minutes remaining in the third period clinched a 2-1 win for the Dutchmen (16-7-3, 8-3-1) at Messa Rink in Schenectady, NY.
“There are no moral victories,” co-captain Chris Huxley said. “A loss is a loss. But I feel like this weekend we did take a step forward. We improved on a lot of things.”
Other players did not return repeated requests for comment.
Despite firing 34 shots in the first two periods on Saturday, Union could not get past senior goaltender Ryan Carroll, making his fifth start of the season. Carroll made 40 saves on the night and helped Harvard enter the third period with a 1-0 lead.
In the first period, the Crimson got on the board with a power-play goal by senior Michael Biega at the 17:34 mark. The forward knocked in a one-timer through traffic off assists from sophomores Danny Biega and Conor Morrison. The tally occurred during the transition from a 5-on-3 to a 5-on-4 Harvard advantage.
The Crimson will look for more power-play success, as it currently sits at a 12.9 percent conversion rate—one of the nation’s lowest marks. Harvard went 1-4 on the power play on Saturday.
“The main thing [on the power play] is execution,” Huxley said. “You just got to execute passes and move the puck quick.”
The second period ended up being a defensive battle. Union, which, according to U.S. Hockey Online, leads the nation with a 2.04 goals against mark, stifled Harvard’s attack, but was unable to even the score at one.
Carroll, the third Crimson goalie to start in the past three games, made a number of important stops in the second period and benefited from a goal-saving play by junior Rence Coassin, who blocked a Union attempt into an open net.
The Dutchmen controlled the shooting in the period, outpacing Harvard, 19-9.
In the third period, Union mounted a comeback with Jeremy Welsh scoring the tying goal 6:48 into the period. Welsh collected a loose puck in the Harvard zone and sent it past Carroll’s glove with a backhander.
With less than three minutes left in the game, Mat Bodie registered the game-winning score.
The play began when Carroll came out of the crease to defend a Union attack. Dutchman Wayne Simpson sent a shot on net, which missed, but Bodie converted with a tip-in.
The Crimson pulled Carroll and had a 6-on-4 opportunity as the game came to a close, but Harvard could not get past Union goalie Keith Kinkaid, who had 25 saves on the night.
The Crimson continued its strong play on the penalty kill against the Dutchmen. Union, leading the nation with a 29.57 percent power-play conversion rate, went 0-for-5 with a man-advantage.
Over the past three games. Harvard has killed all 12 opponent power plays.
With the win, the Dutchmen improved its impressive home record to 10-1-1.
The victory also puts Union in second place in the ECAC, behind Yale, the nation’s top-ranked team.
Harvard currently sits 11 out of 12 in the league standings. The loss marks the first time that the Crimson has been swept by Union in the regular season.

What a difference 15 minutes can make.
Trailing 27-19 at halftime in its last nonconference game against Seattle University, Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith saw in her squad a slow-starting team stymied by an opportunistic Lady Redhawks defense that created 21 turnovers.
But the veteran coach made the necessary adjustments, and the Crimson (9-6, 1-0 Ivy) came out with a surging second half to take the win, 69-55, against the Lady Redhawks (5-16) at the Connolly Center in Seattle, Wash. The matchup on Saturday night was the first-ever meeting between the two schools.
“I would have to credit Seattle’s defense,” Delaney-Smith said. “A lot of teams hadn’t played us the way that Seattle did, so we had to talk about it. We didn’t play a great first half, but the fact that we could make the adjustments and not roll over and die says a lot about the confidence, belief, and trust we had in each other.”
Sophomore forward Miriam Rutzen had her best game in a Harvard uniform, notching her first double-double with 16 points and 12 rebounds to go along with five assists.
Junior point guard Brogan Berry also scored 16 points, while sophomore forward Victoria Lippert provided support with 14 points. Senior forward Emma Markley—who was listed as questionable entering the game—came off the bench to contribute 13 points.
“[Rutzen] is one of the hardest workers on the team, and I think that it really showed today,” Berry said. “She hit all of the shots, got all of her rebounds and passed the ball well. She had an all-around perfect game. When you have a player like that, it’s so easy to play with her.”
Despite the final score showing every indication of yet another strong performance by the Crimson, the team struggled early in the first half to find its offensive rhythm.
Constant ball pressure on the Harvard guards and forwards led to just 19 points in the first 20 minutes of play, as the home team jumped out to an eight-point lead.
The Crimson shot just 30.4 percent from the floor and was 1-of-7 from beyond the arc.
“Against Dartmouth, we had a really great game and we tried to use that as an example of playing together as a team,” Berry said. “At halftime, we just had to remind ourselves that we’ve been [down] before and we can come back to win.”
The difference between the first and second half of play proved to be night and day for Harvard. With a defense that capitalized on creating steals, the Crimson quickly erased its first-half deficit to take control of the game. With 12:07 to go in the second half, a Lippert three-pointer off of an assist from Rutzen capped off a 24-12 run to give Harvard a 43-39 lead.
More turnovers ensued from the Crimson defense, as a steal from Berry—one of her four on the night—led to a fast-break bucket for Markley that essentially sealed a Harvard victory with 2:05 to go.
“In the second half, our comeback really came from our defense, and we got easy steals and easy transition baskets,” Berry said. “Once we had a bunch of runs, [Seattle] got tired, so the pressure wasn’t as strong and, offensively, we were able to wear them away.”
“We only had three turnovers in the second half,” Delaney-Smith said. “We took care of the ball and were able to be a little stronger attacking offensively.”
After a 9-5 record last season against teams outside of the Ivy League, this year’s Crimson team has had a more difficult time getting through the nonconference slate.
But the victory—and, more importantly, the adjustments made by her team at halftime—has given Delaney-Smith confidence as Harvard continues Ivy League play.
“I like the feel of our team,” Delaney-Smith said. “It’s hard for me to verbalize it, but there’s an attitude that reflects toughness, confidence, and experience. Our experienced players are healthier, our younger players have more experience and are a little smarter on the court, and we believe in ourselves. I really like where we are.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you watched the men’s tennis team play this weekend, you would never have guessed that it hasn’t competed a match in over two months. Despite the lack of match play, the Crimson showed signs of the damage it is capable of doing this season.
The No. 64 Harvard men’s tennis team hosted George Washington and Marist this weekend at the Murr Tennis Center for the Harvard Winter Classic. The Crimson dominated the first event of the year, giving the squad confidence going into its dual season starting next week. In the round-robin tournament, Harvard took both first and second place in singles and doubles.
Junior Jonathan Pearlman proved to be the standout individual player of the event. He cruised through two of his matches but had to grind out a tough three-setter to go 3-0 for the event.
In the first match of the weekend, Pearlman used his huge serve to gain the advantage in rallies and came to the net to finish off points in a 6-4, 6-2 victory. Pearlman slipped up in the first set of his second match, losing it 6-2, but came back to win the next two sets, 6-2, 6-3. He finished up the weekend with a 7-6, 6-3 win over senior Christopher Kushma from George Washington.
Pearlman’s classmate Alistair Felton finished runner-up in the singles, going 3-0 as well. Throughout the weekend, his deep returns put his opponents on the defensive from the beginning of points.
He started out with a tough 7-6, 7-6 match, but his aggressive play saw him pull out the win. He had to fight even harder in his second match that went three sets, but Felton remained resilient to win 6-4, 2-6, 6-2. His final match was a much more comfortable 7-5, 6-2 victory over freshman Lorenzo Rossi from Marist.
“I think it went well for me because I won all of my matches,” Felton said. “I improved and got a lot better [as the tournament progressed], so it’s a good confidence booster.”
But the second-place finish wasn’t enough for the Felton. He teamed up with sophomore Andy Nguyen to win the doubles title. The No. 46 pair has been relentless this season, winning the ITA Northeast Regionals and reaching the semifinals of the USTA College Invitational. This weekend, the duo comfortably won its two matches, 8-2 and 8-4.
“I think we’re going to do well this season,” Felton said when asked about his and Nguyen’s chances in the dual season. “We play and train together well so I think we can win a lot of matches.”
Captain Aba Omodele-Lucien and sophomore Josh Tchan took second in the doubles for the weekend. The duo won all three of its matches, the closest being a 9-7 nail-biter that came against Rossi and junior Matt Himmelbach from Marist. The pair won its other two matches much more comfortably, 8-3 and 8-4.
The Crimson’s dominance at the event may not have been that surprising, but its lineup surely was. Playing in his first match since he announced his decision to leave the team in September, senior Alexei Chijoff-Evans tried to reproduce the play that earned him the No. 1 position on the team. Unfortunately, his lack of match play showed, with Chijoff-Evans going 0-3 in the singles, but he still managed to produce a solid game, coming into the net to finish off points when he had the opportunities.
“It’s great to have him back after a long layoff, and it’s good to see him back competing,” Omodele-Lucien said. “We hope he has a good recovery from his break, and we still expect great things from our teammate.”
In his first two matches, Chijoff-Evans lost in straight sets to both Rossi of Marist and Kushma of George Washington. He managed to take it to three sets yesterday in his final match of the weekend, falling 3-6, 7-6, 7-5.
“Playing tennis has been difficult because I didn’t play, essentially, for nine months,” Chijoff-Evans said. “The tennis is there. I can hit the right shots and know the right patterns, but it’s difficult to execute because I’ve been out of match play for a while. The biggest thing right now is not technical. It’s mainly getting my fitness level and confidence up.”
The singles may not have provided Chijoff-Evans with the dream return for which he had been hoping, but he proved to be more dominant in the doubles, partnering with junior Davis Mangham. The duo dominated its first two matches, 8-2 and 8-1, but lost a tight battle, 9-8, to Kushma and sophomore Alexander van Gils, 9-8.
It may not have been a perfect weekend for the Crimson, but the Harvard squad displayed the kind of tennis it will need to produce moving into the dual season. If its players can maintain this level of play, Harvard will be up to face any challenge.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first tournament of the year brought mixed results for the Harvard fencing team, as the No. 2 men and No. 3 women travelled to Queens, N.Y., for the annual St. John’s Invitational yesterday.
After an undefeated run in the Sacred Heart Invitational last month on Dec. 5, the men once again opened with strong performances. In its opening match, the Crimson defeated No. 5 Ohio State, 18-9. After winning against the Buckeyes, the Crimson men would follow up with a pair of victories over host No. 3 St. John’s University, 16-11, and Ivy foe No. 8 Columbia, 18-9.
As in last year’s tournament, the sabre squad on the men’s side was the bright spot on the squad, playing a crucial role in matches against the Red Storm and the Lions.
“We had some really strong performances from our sabre squad—[junior co-captain] Valentin Staller, [freshman] Eric Arzoian, and [sophomore] Thomas Kolasa,” Harvard coach Peter Brand said. “They had only one loss throughout the day. These three guys were definitely our top performers of the tournament.”
But in spite of the commanding victories early in the tournament, the Harvard men were unable to run the table, as the Crimson dropped the final two matches of the day against No. 1 Notre Dame and the defending national champions, No. 4 Penn State.
“I think we did very well.” Staller said. “All the top ranked teams in the country were there. Even though we were missing one of our top players­—Mike Varius, who is away at the World Cup—we still had people like Ben Cohen step up to take his place. We played well, regardless, and that shows that we have a really deep team.”
The story was similarly optimistic on the women’s side. After being blanked, 5-0, in last year’s invitational, the Harvard women went 2-3 for the day, posting victories against St. John’s and Penn State.
Though the women dropped their opening match against No. 1 Notre Dame, 16-11, they would reverse the score against St. John’s to win, 16-11. Despite the victory against the Red Storm, the women would lose their next two matches against No. 10 Ohio State, 18-9, and No. 3 Columbia, 14-13. However, the Crimson would close out the tournament with an upset of No. 2 Penn State.
“On the women’s side we were a little inconsistent,” Brand said. “We were able to defeat a much stronger and better Penn State University team, but then we dropped a close match to Columbia when we shouldn’t have.”
Nevertheless, this year’s performance represented a strong turnaround from last year, and despite some inconsistency, will certainly bode well for future competitions.
“Overall I was very impressed with some of the individual performances,” Brand said. “We have a freshman, Alexandra Keiffer, who went undefeated for the day [in 15 matches].”
With both the men’s and women’s teams nationally ranked, the day’s outcome proved quite promising for the Crimson as it sets its sights on Ivy League play.
“It was a good indicator for us going forward,” Brand said. “The teams that we faced today were probably some of the toughest teams that we will face all year, and it was a really good preparation for us and the Ivy League championship coming up, so I’m feeling pretty good about our chances.”
“Overall, I think we saw really good performances from both sides coming back from the break. It shows that we have strength on the men’s side and great individual performers on the women’s [side].”
The fencing team will next see action on Feb. 6, when it squares off in the MIT Invitational.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the first match of the spring season, No. 44 Harvard women’s tennis came from behind to defeat Boston University, 5-2.
“For the first match of the year, it was so exciting,” Crimson coach Traci Green said. “They mustered up all their strength and fought as a team and won as a team today.”
Harvard fell behind early, only winning one of the three doubles sets to fall behind, 1-0.
Early in the singles matches, the Crimson lost another point when co-captain Samantha Rosekrans had to retire due to tendonitis in her knees after falling behind on the No. 4 court, 5-2.
Having to win four of the remaining five matches, Harvard pushed itself into high gear.
“I’m so proud of our team the way we showed so much natural determination to pull through in the singles,” Green said.
Junior Samantha Gridley, who went 6-1 in the fall, continued her success with a 6-0, 6-0 victory on the No. 6 court to give the Crimson its first point.
“I pulled out two good wins in the fall...that gave me a lot of confidence coming into the spring,” Gridley said. “Knowing that I could pull out those close matches motivated me to work really hard, especially on my fitness, over winter break...When I came to practice for J-Term, I was really physically ready to go and focus on staying more mentally tough.”
Norton soon followed her teammate’s lead, making quick work of Monika Mical, 6-4, 6-2.
“Kristen played with so much emotion out there today,” Green said.
On the No. 5 court, freshman Natalie Blosser handled her first dual match well, winning the first set 6-0. When the second set was tied 5-5, she broke her opponent’s serve at deuce to lead to a 7-5 final score and give Harvard a 3-2 advantage in the contest.
“Natalie had a great performance for a freshman,” Green said. “She came out and played like a sophomore.”
In a rematch of last year’s top match-up between these squads, junior co-captain Holly Cao, ranked No. 45 in the country, faced off against the Terriers’ Stefanie Nunic. Cao fell behind 4-1 early, but she then mounted a comeback to win 11 of the next 13 games to take the match, 6-4, 6-2, and give the Crimson the clinching point.
“I had a slow start,” Cao said. “[Nunic] played well in the first set, but I managed to fight back and win. When it got to the stage when it was 4-1, I looked across the scoreline, and it was all pretty tight. I didn’t want to be the first one to finish the set, so I decided I should stage a comeback.”
“When the chips are down, you can always depend on Holly,” Green said. “Holly doesn’t play the last ball; she always looks to the future. So I’m sure she kept looking ahead in the match and that gave her strength to stay positive and look for that next point.”
In the final remaining match on court No. 2, sophomore Hideko Tachibana lost her first set to BU’s Vivien Laszloffy, 6-4. In the second set, Tachibana turned her game around and pulled ahead, 3-1, thanks to a powerful cross-court backhand volley to break Laszloffy’s serve. She continued on to win the set, 6-2, and the super tiebreak, 10-5, to give Harvard its fifth point.
“Hideko’s match was definitely electric,” Green said. “The crowd was getting into it, and she was so pumped. She’s really a special player and special person. We’re very fortunate to have her on our team.”
“I was running really well today; footwork [was the key],” Tachibana said. “I think this was a really good start to our season. The momentum is going the right way. We have the confidence now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s swimming and diving team had a winter break filled with delayed flights, Caribbean bugs, and consecutive days of racing. But despite everything, including the quick turnaround this past weekend, the Crimson came out of the break successful.
“We had some really fast swims across the board,” co-captain Christine Kaufmann said. “The goal was to finish the season strong. We really just wanted to get out there, race some different events, and try some new race plans out. The team did a strong job with that.”
The weekend began with the two-day Rutgers Invitational, where the Crimson came close to dethroning the No. 13 Minnesota Gophers, who held off Harvard, 274-250. On Sunday, the Crimson convincingly won against University of Pennsylvania, 192-105, in its first and only meet at home this season. With the win and close second-place finish, Harvard hopes to build momentum into next weekend’s Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet.
HARVARD 192, PENN 105
While three consecutive days of racing took a toll on the Crimson, the team refused to show it, starting its meet at Blodgett Pool with four wins in the first four races.
“It was pretty emotional for a bunch of us,” Kaufmann said. “Personally, I’ve been swimming [at Blodgett] since I was nine or so, but in general the senior class was looking forward to racing at home. There’s something special about racing at home.”
Harvard began in a dominant fashion, taking first and second place in the 200-yard medley event. The women continued their success in the next race, taking the top three spots—led by Kaufmann—in the 1000-yard freestyle.
In the third race of the day, senior Kate Mills easily won the 200-yard freestyle, while sophomore Laura Evans led a one-two-three Crimson finish in the 100-yard backstroke along with sophomores Caroline Weaver and Carol Lin. Later, Evans led another three-peat in the 200-yard breaststroke with senior Katherine Pickard and junior Helen Pitchik.
Harvard saw three more one-two-three finishes against the Quakers, with sophomore Christine Hughes winning the 100-yard freestyle event ahead of two teammates, junior Monica Burgos and sophomore Camille Hendrix. In the 100-yard butterfly, co-captain Ali Slack quickly took the lead, while sophomores Kelly Robinson and Lin battled it out for second and third.
In the last three-peat of the day, sophomores Weaver, Hughes, and Clare Foster easily outraced their counterparts in the 200-yard medley.
“Those girls have been training extremely hard,” Kaufmann said. “It’s always good to see underclassmen have strong races because we’re going to need them to keep the momentum for the next couple of years.”
In the diving well, freshman Schuyler Moore and sophomore Brittany Powell led the charge in the 1-meter event, placing first and second, while senior Jenny Reese finished ahead of the pack in the 3-meter dive.
Reese and senior diver Tanille Panioque celebrated their last meet at Blodgett by competing in the 200-yard freestyle relay, an event in which each diver raced 25-meters along with the rest of the 2011 class.
“Our class has been very fortunate because we’re still just as close as we were freshman year,” senior Katy Hinkle said. “To have Jenny and Tanille race, it was a great way to end our senior meet.”
RUTGERS INVITATIONAL
Before its win over the Quakers, Harvard placed second at the Rutgers Invitational, falling 24 points shy of No. 13 Minnesota, but over 100 points ahead of Rutgers and Toledo.
“That’s a huge success for our team,” Kaufmann said. “Minnesota is a very good program, and we were very excited to race them this weekend.”
Hinkle and Mills led the charge for the Crimson, with each taking two first-place finishes. In the 50-yard freestyle, Hinkle finished in 23.66, just .01 ahead of Minnesota’s Meagan Radecke. In the 100-yard freestyle, Hinkle finished ahead of freshman Jenna Gregoire. Mills took the top spot in the 400-yard individual medley and broke two minutes in the 200-yard butterfly.
“It was a lot of racing, which is great because at this point in the season, it’s something we like to do and have the chance to swim that much,” Hinkle said. “Rutgers and Minnesota have a lot of great swimmers, so to get a chance to compete out of the Ivy League was exciting as well.”
Other highlights of the two-day event included the relay races, where Harvard placed first in the 200- and 400-yard freestyle relays, beating Minnesota in each race by half a second.
“I loved doing the relays at Rutgers because relays are such a team event,” Hinkle said. “To swim against Minnesota that was 13th overall [and] to put up some good relays and then win some was great.”
Representing the diving team, Moore placed third in both the 1-meter and 3-meter diving events, while classmate Brittany Powell placed fifth and sixth in each event, respectively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the modern era of sports, being a college coach carries with it the burden of constant media attention. Facing dozens of reporters at press conferences, head coaches have gotten savvier—they say what they need to and leave the rest up for speculation. Here at The Back Page, we’re happy to decode some of these media sessions, showing the average fan what we think coaches’ answers “really” mean.
It was a tale of two halves when Ivy play came to Lavietes Pavilion last Saturday. The Harvard men’s basketball team started out slowly, and it looked like the Crimson was in danger of being upset by league doormat Dartmouth, which held a 12-point lead early in the second half.  But with suffocating defense and timely offense, Harvard went on a 31-10 run to close out the game, and it salvaged a 59-50 win. Though disappointed with the Crimson’s play, particularly in the first half, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker was pleased with the spirit his team showed as it fought its way back into the game. We take a look at Amaker’s postgame remarks and interpret the state of the Crimson in this week’s edition of Sound Off.
What Amaker said: “I thought that Dartmouth played a tremendous game, particularly in the first half. They shot the ball extremely well. I thought that we showed a great deal of toughness and grit to be able to dig one out when it wasn’t going necessarily our way. Things weren’t as easily flowing for us as they have been, but I thought [freshman guard] Matt Brown came in and gave us a great shot in the arm defensively. It was nice to see him step forward with a few shots, but his presence and his defense, toughness out there, was a big key for us. We certainly didn’t play as well as we would’ve liked, but give Dartmouth credit.”
What Amaker meant: The Big Green, a traditional lightweight in Ivy basketball, gave Harvard all it could handle. The reason for Dartmouth’s early success was its surprising ability to convert shots. The Big Green, which sits 331st in the nation in field goal shooting at 38.0 percent, shot a blistering 48.3 percent from the field and 50.0 percent from three in the opening frame. But the Crimson buckled down after the break, holding Dartmouth to 23.1 percent shooting for the rest of the game. This defensive intensity was spearheaded by Brown, a reserve guard, who tallied three steals in 15 minutes and marked the Big Green’s sharp-shooting guards, R.J. Griffin and Jabari Trotter. By holding Dartmouth to 10 points over the final 15:36, Harvard was able to overcome lackluster execution and pull out the win.
What Amaker said: “Different guys all year have had to step forward for us. At Mercer, it was [freshman guard] Ernest Rouse; [freshman center] Ugo [Okam] gave us great minutes here against Holy Cross. We’ve just had different guys stepping forward. [Sophomore forward] Kyle [Casey] has been injured in the early part of the year—now he’s coming back. Matt [Brown] played well for us at GW. When Kyle was out, we had [sophomore forward] Jeff [Georgatos] starting—he’s been in there. So we talked about that prior to this game, that different guys were going to have to help us and step forward and have our team grow. There was a lot of growth that took place this afternoon.”
What Amaker meant: Four minutes into the second half, when Harvard faced its greatest deficit, Amaker went to his bench and subbed in Brown and Georgatos. The result was a 23-2 run that swung the game. The Crimson’s depth is frequently cited as its greatest weakness, but with sophomore guard Christian Webster (hip) and junior forward Andrew Van Nest (illness) sidelined, Harvard got a lift from its reserves. Given the grueling nature of the Ivy League schedule, the maturation and “growth” of these role players will be crucial if the Crimson hopes to contend for the conference title.
What Amaker said (on the status of Webster’s return from a hip injury): “We’re hopeful for next weekend. We were hopeful for today, but things weren’t progressing as well as we would’ve liked. All this week and then all of next week, I assume, or I’m hoping, that we’re going to get him back to practice at some point. So far he hasn’t been able to do that. Maybe sometime next week we can have him out there, and see if he can be ready to go for next Friday.”
What Amaker meant: Amaker’s measured response does not promise Webster’s return to the court this weekend, but it offers some hope. Last weekend was the perfect opportunity to rest the ailing sophomore, enabling him to recover for two weeks while missing only one game. He has been kept out of practice so far, but if the hip feels good in practice this week, it looks like Webster—the Crimson’s second-leading scorer—will be cleared to face Columbia. His ability to put the ball on the floor and attack the rim was sorely missed against Dartmouth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Collegiate wrestling has been a long road for junior Corey Jantzen, and, unfortunately for the seventh-ranked grappler, it’s just gotten tougher.
After suffering a torn elbow ligament in practice over J-Term, the 141 lb. competitor learned that he will undergo surgery this Friday, ending his season. It will be the second competitive year that Jantzen has missed after losing significant time to a knee injury his sophomore season.
“It’s been a frustrating college career for him—it’s not fun,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said after the Lone Star Duals. “We’re hoping for the best.”
And so is Jantzen, who expects to make a full recovery for next season.
“I’ll definitely be able to come back,” he said. “We’re working on trying to get a ‘medical hardship’ year to get this year back too.”
Whether or not Jantzen earns a second year of eligibility, he will face another uphill climb to get back in wrestling shape for the Crimson. After taking last year off from school and focusing on freestyle competition, Jantzen struggled in the fall as he readjusted to collegiate style. But the wrestler was beginning to hit his stride this winter—reaching No. 7 nationally—before he went down. Now eight months of rehab stand between Jantzen and his next collegiate match, but the former All-Ivy grappler isn’t fazed.
“I’ll start rehabbing immediately—obviously in the beginning with small stuff,” he said.
For the remainder of this season, Harvard will have to make do without its top wrestler, but as Jantzen has shown before, even major injuries won’t prevent him from returning to form.

This post has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: JANUARY 25, 2010
An earlier version of the Jan. 24 Flyby post "10 Easy Classes" incorrectly interpreted the Q Guide scale for weekly average workload.
