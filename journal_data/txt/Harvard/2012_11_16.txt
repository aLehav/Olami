After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the Dark Ages, physicians believed that applying leeches to one’s skin would extract “bad blood” and cure a patient of his or her maladies. This practice persisted for a shockingly long time: well into the 18th century! How could such an unhealthy and dangerous behavior persist for so long?
One day, with similar incredulity, our descendents will ask how we, as a society, wrote civil laws with abandon. They will find the same two reasons we find when we analyze the past. First, a few patients did, in fact, get better. Second, people were afraid not to put on leeches. So how do leeches and laws intersect?
First, laws, like leeches, work like placebos in the short run. People generally felt better about themselves shortly after being “bled.” Similarly, the public generally feels better about itself after its coffers have been figuratively bled. When the temperance movements at the turn of the century brought alcoholism into the spotlight, society cried out for a law to do something. Prohibition did enjoy moderate success in the short term (before producing even more cases of alcoholism by the end of the 1920s). Perhaps it is the feeling of being temporarily faint or delusional. Soon enough, with the rush of blood back to the head, comes a pounding headache.
Second, people like to pass laws because of that satisfying “finally-someone-is-doing-something-about-something-dagnabbit” feeling. But the result is as murky as that feeling is nebulous. People liked to put on leeches because they feel they’re doing something, but, of course, you can’t create jobs by just breaking windows.
Laws should not be the first solution we turn to when confronting public problems. That a problem is serious (just as alcoholism was a serious problem in the early 20th century) does not necessitate a law to show its severity. There are other, better ways to go about solving collective problems: publicity campaigns, individual behavioral change, the private sector, better parenting, better education, and other social solutions.
You may be wondering: If the law does not directly affect us, what possible harm could there be in just another piece of legislation? Excessive lawmaking is, like leeching, more often than not, counterproductive. Like leeches drain one’s lifeblood, legislative excess bleeds one’s livelihood. Simply put, wait until you see the bill. Writing laws costs money to pay legislators, to hire legal advisers, to pay law enforcement, and to cover the inevitable lawsuits that will ensue. These are merely the costs of a blank bill; they do not cover the specific funds that each bill calls for.
It’s important to stress that it does not have to be this way. We don’t have to look far away to see where few but good laws work well. The U.S. Constitution is notable for two things in particular: its tremendous success and its remarkable brevity. Over the course of 223 years, we have added just 17 amendments, and the Constitution still has fewer words than an applied math term paper. It’s a veritable legislative tweet! Meanwhile, I use my copy of the California Constitution as an ottoman.
Obviously, this does not apply to all social ills that receive national attention. Certain public problems, like robbery, will always need laws. I simply propose some alternative solutions, just as some doctor 700 hundred years ago surely suggested that perhaps a simple bath would be a better idea than covering the patient in bloodsucking leeches. For example, the green movement has achieved tremendous success through publicity campaigns and the proliferation of private alternative energy companies. Most importantly, this success is not fleeting. The success of the green movement is as sustainable as the forms of energy it encourages because it has worked itself into the private sector.
We are a country profoundly infatuated with laws since our very inception. When reading the Declaration of Independence, one is struck by the remarkably legalistic terms used in listing the Founders’ grievances. America is commonly referred to as the fulfillment of John Locke’s theory of government grounded in the rule of law. With our country’s love of laws in mind, the abuse of legislation becomes apparent. Simply put, we are accustomed to treating every public pressure with a legal knee jerk. This is a problem because it makes a mockery of our legal system. If this trend of legal leeching continues, we will find ourselves overprescribed and still under the weather.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Israel and Hamas draw closer to tragic confrontation, a vast class of amateur pundits has come out of the woodwork to weigh in on the comparative rights and wrongs. Dodging in and out of vitriolic Facebook arguments, I came upon a piece in Rutgers’ student newspaper, the Daily Targum, nondescriptly titled “Israel Must Act Responsibly”.
In her brief column, Amani Al-Khatahtbeh poses a standard pro-Palestinian argument about conditions on the ground in Gaza, well within the expected range of opinions that populate my heated, Middle East-heavy news feed. What stands out most is a peculiar claim about American media coverage of the conflict: “We are basically being told, ‘It’s OK that our largest-funded ally is killing all those brown people—they asked for it.’”
Aside from the unexamined fact that many Israelis are browner than many Palestinians, I was struck by the utter incongruity of Khatahtbeh’s resort to racial language, folded in amongst arguments that draw from international law and political economy. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a dense thicket of conflicting dreams and grievances about land ownership, national identity, and religion, is anything but a matter of skin color.
However, a growing contingent on the left has taken to caricaturing the conflict as one between white Israeli colonists and brown Palestinians indigenes at the mercy of an empire. The framework of colonialism is certainly worth including in the discussion. Yet in analogizing the Jews of Israel to Algeria’s Pieds-Noir and South Africa’s Boers, the pro-Palestinian left’s race-baiters stake a dangerous claim: European Jewish intruders should get out of the Middle East. For those of us who believe in some sort of coexistence in the land of Canaan, this language threatens the very foundations of peace and reduces the complexities of a tragic conflict to racial homily.
Although it’s clear that “white” doubles as “wealthy,” “privileged,” and “Western” in critics’ racial essentialization of Israeli Jews, the relative wealth, privilege, and Western status enjoyed today by Jewish people is anything but essential. Unlike British and French colonists, whose privilege accrued over centuries of political and economic ascendancy, the European ancestors of now-powerful Israelis were most often poor, disenfranchised, and pursued. In 20th-century Germany, Jewish citizens’ attempts to live “white” lives were rejected by racial purists who insisted that they “go to Palestine.” In my grandparents’ age, there was still a running question in the United States as to whether Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazi Jews could be accepted as white.
This is, of course, not to speak of the many Israeli Jews whose recent roots trace back to the Middle East and North Africa. If Palestinian Arabs are to be considered brown, it is unreasonable to call the hundreds of thousands of Yemeni, Iraqi, and Moroccan Jews in Israel anything but the same. And since the beginning of Ethiopian immigration in the 1980s, Israeli Jews have come in yet a darker shade. The reduction of Israel to whiteness thus proves to be nothing more than a sloppy, overreaching extension of the settler-colonial narrative prominent on the left.
Moreover, attempts to generalize Palestinians into the ambiguous brownness of Cubans, Zulus, Filipinos, and Indians gloss over the peculiarities of Levantine Arab racial identity, which often has more to do with religious affiliation than with ethnic origin. Many Christian Palestinians, Lebanese, and Syrians in the Middle East and abroad are accepted as white on the basis of their Western names, cultural affinities, religious preferences, and white-enough visages. Looking beyond the political narrative, Palestinian brownness is just as contingent and problematic as Israeli whiteness.
 
Perhaps most aptly, against Khatahtbeh’s implication that Jews and Palestinians are a racial world apart, an uninformed observer at a Jerusalem market would be hard-pressed to tell apart similarly dressed members of the two ethnic groups. To the chagrin of radicals on each side who rush to disavow blood ties to the other, Israelis are not the Khazars of Arthur Koestler’s “The Thirteenth Tribe,” nor are Palestinians the Arabians of Joan Peters’ “From Time Immemorial”.
I carry an Abrahamic pride in the fact that I have been mistaken for Palestinian; it suggests that I have an extra obligation to figure out a way for my people to share the land with our not-so-different cousins. The daunting challenges we face are political, military, and economic in nature. To invent a racial dimension blows open an additional chasm between our peoples, setting back the enterprise of coexistence yet another step.

Yale’s website defines plagiarism as “the use of someone else’s work, words, or ideas as if they were one’s own.” It is a pity, then, that poor Reverend Thomas  Clap—president of Yale from 1740-1766—didn’t live long enough to use the internet. Indeed, it is clear that Reverend Clap’s tenure belied the moral rectitude that his forbearers had intended to uphold by abandoning their alma mater for the Lyme Disease-infested fields of Connecticut. It was during the 26 debaucherous years of the Clap administration that Yale constructed that brazen monument to deceit and misrepresentation known today as Connecticut Hall.
Connecticut Hall, constructed in 1752, bears, shall we say, a striking resemblance to a certain brick building wedged between Johnston Gate and Matthews Hall. What is its name? Oh, yes, Massachusetts Hall—and it was built 32 years earlier. Yalies have been griping for the better part of 311 years about living in the shadow of Harvard. Yet, how can they hope to escape unfavorable comparison to their neighbor to the north when the oldest building on their campus is but an inferior imitation of Massachusetts Hall? For the sake of integrity and for the sake of Yalie mental health, we recommend that Yale immediately demolish Connecticut Hall.
One can imagine the conversation: “Hey, Eli, what should we name our new building?” “Gee, Gurdon, I’m fresh out of ideas! What’s the name of that pretty Harvard building what’s got all the bricks?” “I think they call it ‘Massachusetts Hall.’” “Oh, then we’ll call ours Connecticut Hall!” While imitation is the highest form of flattery, such brazen replication is uncreative at best and aesthetically offensive at worst.
Perhaps the most heinous feature of Connecticut Hall is the window trimming. It’s as if they thought painting the windows black would prevent people from noticing its striking similarity to America’s oldest college building, whose windows are dressed in white. Sadly, it does not. Quite to the contrary, it has just accentuated the flagrant mimicry that has characterized Yale since the first brick of Connecticut Hall was placed on its foundation.
Yale’s decidedly masturbatory “Architecture of Yale” web page confesses that “Connecticut Hall is in many ways a Harvard building.” Admitting there is a problem is an excellent first step. If Yale wants to forge an identity outside the shadow of Harvard, it must first rename its plagiaristic flagship building. Black window trimming cannot mask three centuries of deceit. Maybe a bulldozer can.

Last week, in an attempt to save money on kosher meals, Harvard University Dining Services put up a sign outside the Hillel dining hall stating that only members and invited guests of the Jewish community should eat there. In response, Hillel’s executive director, Jonah C. Steinberg, asserted that this externally imposed restriction “creates conflict with [Hillel’s] inclusive and welcoming environment.” Indeed, it is true that the Hillel community values the Hillel dining hall as an open space for all regardless of religious affiliation.
However, while this unfortunate situation is HUDS’s fault, not Hillel’s, Harvard Hillel hasn’t exactly proven itself a welcoming space for all in the past week. In fact, Hillel International policies have actively excluded important voices from Hillel—which is deeply disturbing to us, as members of the Harvard College Progressive Jewish Alliance, a Hillel-affiliated group.
Yesterday, PJA co-sponsored an event entitled “Jewish Voices Against the Israeli Occupation” with the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee. The event featured two Jewish speakers—one Israeli and one American—involved in peaceful activism opposing Israel’s settlement policy in the West Bank. The speakers discussed the relationship between their Jewish identity and their present activism, as well as ways in which students going on Birthright could encounter a more diverse array of perspectives on their trip.
Originally, PJA planned to hold this event within Harvard Hillel, believing that the center for the Jewish community on campus would be an ideal location for an event featuring Jewish speakers and dealing with a very salient topic for young Jewish Americans. However, Hillel’s leadership forced us to relocate the event, explaining that according to Hillel International’s “Guidelines for Campus Israel Activities,” Hillel will not “partner with, house, or host organizations that... support boycott of, divestment from, or sanctions…against the State of Israel,” which PSC does. This policy prevents not only PSC but also Students for Justice in Palestine, the major Palestinian group on U.S. campuses with chapters at 50 colleges and universities around the country, from ever co-sponsoring events or even speaking in Hillel buildings. While Hillel International claims to “welcome a diversity of student perspectives on Israel” and to “create an inclusive, pluralistic community,” its guidelines encourage exclusivity rather than inclusivity and conformity rather than diversity.
As progressive Jews working for peace and justice in Israel/Palestine, we believe that a Hillel policy that encourages dialogue and collaboration with Palestinian groups is an essential step on the path toward peace. If we cannot reach across the divides of ethnicity, religion, and politics on our own campuses, how can we ever expect Israeli and Palestinian politicians to do so?
Many of those who defend Hillel’s current policy claim that the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement—or BDS for short—is anti-Semitic. However, while some who advocate for this position may be anti-Semitic, the movement as a whole is not. If Hillel allowed its members and the members of PSC to engage and work together, more Hillel students might come to understand, as we have, that PSC members support BDS not out of prejudice but as a non-violent political strategy that aims to change Israeli policies that they find unjust. While PJA does not endorse the international BDS movement—we believe that there are better ways to promote a two-state solution and the rights of both Israelis and Palestinians—the fact that we or others disagree on a political position is hardly grounds for banning that view from Hillel.
Hillel must embrace the values of open discussion in order to be truly pluralistic and serve all Jewish students. As we explained in an open letter to the Hillel community, Hillel International’s current policies exclude not only Palestinian perspectives, but also many progressive Jewish viewpoints, including a wide variety of opinions that are more moderate and mainstream within the Jewish community than the International BDS movement. For instance, Brandeis Hillel rejected an appeal for affiliation from Brandeis Jewish Voice for Peace, because the group had held an “Israeli occupation awareness week” and advocates selective divestment from companies that profit off the occupation. Prominent liberal Zionist Peter Beinart, who supports a boycott of the Israeli settlements as a strategy to pressure Israel to preserve its democratic character, could also be prevented from speaking at Hillel under these policies. Jewish student groups that support his position could be excluded from organized Jewish campus life. As progressive Jews, we do not feel comfortable in a religious and cultural community that maintains such political litmus tests.
In the coming days and weeks, we will be reaching out to students at Harvard and other colleges and universities to petition jointly Hillel International to remove these ideological requirements for affiliated groups, organizational partnership, and invited speakers. We hope that the wider Jewish community will support us as we advocate for a more open and inclusive Hillel.

Harvard’s Phi Beta Kappa chapter notified 48 seniors Thursday afternoon that they had been selected to join the prestigious honors society.
The notifications marked the second of three opportunities for the Class of 2013 to join Phi Beta Kappa. The society makes its first selections at the end of a class’s junior year, when 24 members are chosen, and the third and last opportunity comes just before graduation, when approximately 96 students are selected to join.
Although the main criterion for eligibility is a student’s GPA, the committee also considers his or her transcript and letters of recommendation. According to the website of the Harvard chapter, the committee pays particular attention to the difficulty and diversity of a student’s program of study.
Sumit Malik ’13, an applied math concentrator, believes that his varied interests helped him to be selected as one of the “Senior 48.”
“I’ve been interested in classes across multiple academic disciplines,” said Malik. “I’m studying applied math with economics and computer science and also getting a secondary in English.”
Patrick W, Lauppe ’13, a literature concentrator, thinks that Phi Beta Kappa recognized his commitment to challenging himself.
“I’ve always felt the need to put a class in my schedule that challenges me quite a bit,” said Lauppe, who is also a Crimson arts editor. “For example, this semester I decided to take CS50.”
Lauppe was particularly happy to receive the commendation, as it helps to alleviate some of his stress about applications.“
This is just suggesting that, despite everything, I’ve maintained commitment to my studies, and it’s just a little kicker in this race for jobs and fellowships,” he said.
The honor, however, was not enough to distract these accomplished students from their full schedules.
“I haven’t really had time to react to it,” said Katherine S. Xue, a chemical and physical biology concentrator.
“The most immediate thing for me was to put the final touches on my English essay, which I had to turn in very shortly.”

History professor Joyce E. Chaplin sought to capture half a millennium of human efforts to traverse the globe in the pages of one book, and Thursday evening, she discussed the fruits of her labors in a talk at the Harvard Book Store.
Chaplin said the inspiration for her book, called "Round About the Earth: Circumnavigation from Magellan to Orbit," came from a research project in the middle of the ocean, during which her only form of entertainment was a French edition of Jules Verne’s classic, "Around the World in Eighty Days."
Launching into a brief summation of circumnavigation as an act spanning 500 years of history, Chaplin described it not as a study of geography, but as a "geodrama."
"While geography engages the human eye, hand, and mind, geodrama requires all of the human being—the entire body in relation to Gaia, or the Earth," Chaplin said.
Chaplin’s book divides this drama into three distinct acts. The first spans from 1519—the year of Ferdinand Magellan’s departure for his around-the-world expedition—to 1779, the year of James Cook’s death in Hawaii. It was a time when mariners traversed the earth in fear.
During the second act, from the 1780s to the 1920s, travelers gained confidence that they could survive circumnavigation. Not only did they view the journey as plausible, but it also became a popular pastime.
The third and final act, from the 1920s to the present, has given rise to concerns about circumnavigation’s impact on the environment. “Confidence has given way to doubt. There is a growing sense that the planet is beginning to bite back or shrug us off,” said Chaplin.
After a ten minute reading and an extensive question and answer session, some audience members voiced strong reactions. "I loved the way she links [circumnavigation] to power structures and empires. I just think it’s so interesting. A great way to intersect so many periods of history," said Lisa Ford, a visiting academic from the University of New South Wales in Australia.
Ultimately, Chaplin emphasized the enormously transformative nature of circumnavigation on humanity. "Having a sense of the individual human in physical relation to the entire planet," said Chaplin, "people might have thought about that metaphorically, but to make it real has hugely impacted human thought."

Despite the continuation of the College’s notoriously strict tailgating policies, House Committees have assured students that they will be able to enjoy a variety of festivities—both on and off the tailgating field—in preparation for Saturday’s Harvard-Yale football game.
For their part, Quincy House residents plan to fly penguin-shaped balloons and to deploy, yet again, the penguin costumes that left quite the impression at last year’s Game. As HoCo co-chair Catherine G. Katz ’13 recalled, the outfits caught the attention of company representatives at Vineyard Vines and Jack Wills, who insisted on posing with the students for pictures.
While Quincy is rallying their efforts around building House spirit before The Game, other Houses plan to keep their tailgates relatively low-key and to focus on auxiliary activities like Stein Clubs.
Winthrop, for example, will have a tailgate complete with warm food and drinks, but it plans to channel most of its energy into holding a Stein Club before The Game, according to HoCo co-chair Lauren E. Tiedemann ’13.
"It’s a pain to get a lot of stuff over there and getting everything set up and cleaned up pretty quickly," she said about the tailgate. Since other Houses and student organizations will be hosting tailgates of their own, Tiedemann said she thinks it would be more prudent for Winthrop to spend its money on the Stein Club.
Some Houses will spend more of their funding on alcohol this year. Currier, which will be hosting a Stein Club with its Yale sister college after The Game, purchased twice as much alcohol as in previous years, according to HoCo co-chair Samuel M. Meyer ’13.
"We’d rather overbuy and use it at another event, than the other way around," Meyer said. "I know other Houses have run out in the past."
Meanwhile, Leverett has set aside $1,000 for alcohol and will be serving mimosas, hard cider, and Smirnoff Ice, according to House Committee co-chair Gary D. Carlson ’13.
While Yale tailgates are known to be more lax than those at Harvard, the College will continue to enforce its ban on kegs and hard liquor. The policy has remained unchanged since its implementation in 2008, according to Interim Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich.
Students who wish to drink alcohol must present valid identification and wear a bracelet supplied by the Student Event Services Team. As in previous years, the tailgate will conclude at noon during kickoff.
"There are good policies in place for handling Harvard-Yale," Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds said in an interview with The Crimson. "We always work very hard to make sure that students can have a good time but also hope that they will be responsible in their own behavior."
Though some House Committee members expect the Harvard-based tailgate to be more policed than its counterpart at Yale, they said they understand the need for the College’s tailgating policies and look forward to The Game’s morning festivities.
"I mean, honestly, the school has a lot of good reasons for making their decisions," said Kirkland House Committee co-chair Kevin Garcia ’14. "Obviously, some decisions won’t fare well with others, but I think we’ll have a good time anyway."

The Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers rallied with its supporters on Thursday in a demonstration of solidarity as contract negotiations between the union and the University drag into their eighth month.
Hundreds of protesters swarmed the plaza in front of Dudley House and raised their voices in chants and songs—at one point, urging the administration to "invest in the staff" in a song set to the tune of "Hey Jude." One woman lifted a sign that read, in reference to a recent pop hit, "We have no contract, and this is crazy. Treat the union fairly, maybe?
"HUCTW, which represents more than 4,600 of Harvard’s non-faculty staff, has been deadlocked in negotiations with the University regarding a contract that was originally scheduled to go into effect on July 1. The lack of "any real significant movement" in the negotiations, as HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger puts it, has led to undesirable delays for union members seeking a contract that calls for higher salaries and more affordable health-care plans.
"I’m standing up for those people who come here every day and give 110 percent," Tasha Williams, president of HUCTW, shouted into the microphone as she stood before the crowd. "We want Harvard to appreciate the work we do."
The "We (Still) Can’t Eat Prestige" rally, which takes its name from a HUCTW slogan more than several decades old, was the third public event organized by the union over the past two months to garner community support.
George Kokkinogenis, a HUCTW member who works as an IT analyst at the Business School, said he hoped the rally would show the University that the negotiations affect the very livelihoods of its workers.
"We’re not just numbers on a paper,"  Kokkinogenis said. “We’re actually people."
At the rally, speakers gave testimonials and read from letters that union members had sent to high-level University administrators about the personal importance of the negotiations. Musical interludes were provided by the Second Line Social Aid and Pleasure Society Brass Band, a group that uses music in support of social activism.
U.S. Senator John F. Kerry and Senator-elect Elizabeth Warren—also a professor at Harvard Law School—sent messages of support to the union, according to HUCTW officer Peter Berry, who read a letter from Kerry at Thursday’s rally.
"You’re at the very core of the people who make the University hum on a daily basis," Kerry wrote to HUCTW, adding that he hoped for the "fair and equitable contract you deserve."
Harvard spokesman Paul Andrew said the University is committed to agreeing on a fair contract. "We have been proactive in negotiations with the union," he wrote in an emailed statement, "proposing offers that are highly competitive in the market and consistent with agreements reached with other unions at Harvard."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of dining service employees across the University have signed a petition calling for the reinstatement of a dining hall worker whom they claim was fired in retaliation for his union activities.
The workers plan to deliver the petition along with a formal grievance on Monday to demand rehiring and back pay for Scott P. Brown, a former pot washer and UNITE HERE! shop steward in the Dunster/Mather dining area who was fired on Sept. 4.
"This kind of discrimination against an employee is both reprehensible and illegal, and must end immediately," the petition states. "Scott’s termination is an affront to every employee of [Harvard University Dining Services], and undermines the relationship of collaboration and mutual respect between HUDS and its employees that we strive to maintain."
Five employees who worked with Scott in Dunster and Mather said that the dining area’s general manager singled out Brown, harassing and eventually firing him because he spoke up for other workers.
"[Brown] was the first one to stand up and speak for the workers. I think that has a lot to do with [his termination]," said Betty Johnson, a lead dining hall worker in the two Houses. "They just wanted to get him out of there because he was there to help."
Ed B. Childs, a chief shop steward and Adams chef who has worked at Harvard for 37 years, said that copies of the petition have been circulating in 14 dining halls and five campus cafés operated by HUDS, such as the Greenhouse Café in the Science Center.
University spokesperson Kevin Galvin said he would not comment on a case still going through the grievance process, and several HUDS and human resources officials, including Brown’s manager, did not return requests or declined to comment.
By Wednesday night, a group of shop stewards had gathered 237 signatures from nine dining halls and said that they expected more.
Childs said that the vast majority of workers presented with the petition had signed it. "Every worker who heard the case is appalled," he said.
In Annenberg, for example, 51 of 68 workers signed the petition, according to shop steward Kerry E. Maiato.
"They’re pretty devastated," Maiato said of his coworkers in Annenberg.
Brown’s termination notice from his general manager stated that he was late to his station on Sept. 4, two weeks after receiving a final warning due to "failure to adhere to HUDS employee expectations," and that after he refused to leave, Harvard police officers escorted him off campus.
"Due to this incident which included tardiness and insubordinate behavior your employment is being terminated effective today," the notice read.Brown later received a letter from Harvard police stating that he was prohibited from Harvard property due to his "recent behavior toward members of the Harvard community."
Brown has previously been terminated and reinstated twice, in June 2006 and Aug. 2008. In both cases, Brown said, he was fired after not reporting for shifts that he did not know he was scheduled for. Both times, Brown was reinstated after filing grievances.Brown’s prior warning that preceded his most recent termination stated that he failed to return to work from summer break on Aug. 14,  the date that he had indicated in April.
He said he was issued an earlier discipline warning in part because he missed a cleaning day, which he had not been told to report for. In nine years working at Harvard, he had not previously been asked to work a cleaning day, he said.
"[My manager] was scheduling me for times I couldn’t work or didn’t know about," Brown said. He and other shop stewards also contend that HUDS fired him without following steps promised in workers’ contracts. "She disciplines you because she’s trying to get you." As a shop steward, Brown said he has long tried to speak up when he perceives mistreatment by management of any worker in his dining area.
"The deck is stacked against employees," Brown said. "They try to limit union conversations in the dining hall. People are afraid to talk to you." His co-worker Jeffrey Wiggins, a dining services employee of nearly a decade, said that managers seemed to be upset that workers looked up to Brown.
"Every time they talked to him, it would be negative," Wiggins said. "They just started nitpicking on certain things he did.... The main reason why he was let go is he was helping others."
Michael C. Charles, a checker in Quincy who has also helped organize the petition, said that he hoped it would help Brown, who had helped many other workers, get back to work.
"He’s sticking his neck out for everyone else. We’re behind him 110 percent," Charles said, emphasizing that the workers’ contract provides for shop stewards to represent workers’ concerns to management. "He shouldn’t be penalized for that—it’s part of our contract."
"We’re going to fight this vigorously," Childs said. “He was one of the most trained shop stewards.” He outlined the petitioners’ next steps: delivering the signatures they have collected, stapled to a grievance, to Brown’s former manager on Monday, and attending a hearing with managers on Wednesday. That meeting will be the third and final step in the grievance process outlined in the University’s agreement with UNITE HERE! Local 26.
Brown put more stock in the grievance process but said he appreciated his co-workers’ petition. "It’s a nice gesture," he said. "I think anything that shows unity and strength is a good thing.... It can’t hurt."
Local 26 President Brian Lang said that he could not comment on any specific case, but that he supported the spirit of the petition. "It’s a good thing that...the workers stand up and back each other up," he said. "That’s a major part of what being a union is."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kate Sim ’14 and Pearl Bhatnagar ’14, who together spearheaded one of the three referenda on the Undergraduate Council presidential ballot this week, stumbled upon the student referendum procedure by accident.
Unaware of this option, the pair had spent much of the semester personally reaching out to dozens of student organizations to push for increased dialogue about sexual assault on campus. But when a UC representative suggested that Sim and Bhatnagar consider a student referendum, they recognized an opportunity to conduct advocacy on a greater scale.
Sim and Bhatnagar’s unfamiliarity with the process is not surprising, given that students last voted on a referendum in 2007, when just over 40 percent of undergraduates voted on—and passed—a proposal to shift winter exams before the break.
In an effort to revitalize the referendum system, the UC revisited the rules and clarified protocol for students in a November meeting. Thanks to the UC’s renewed emphasis, students will be able to vote for three referenda on the presidential ballot until noon Friday.
The three items ask students if they support Harvard’s divestment of funds from the fossil-fuel industry; if they support a reevaluation of Harvard’s sexual-assault policy; and if they support a social-choice fund within Harvard’s endowment.
The passage of a referendum not only shapes the UC’s advocacy efforts, but also provides student leaders with a newfound tool in conversations with University administrators about reform at the institutional level.
Students must collect signatures from 10 percent of the student body and present their petition for a referendum to the UC at least 10 days before campaigning begins. Students have two opportunities to propose a referendum: the first coinciding with the UC presidential election, and the other immediately following spring break.
UC Rules Committee Chair Darragh J. Nolan ’15 said a number of student groups have already expressed interest in proposing spring referenda, including an initiative to ban the sale of bottled water on campus.
"I think it will become a popular thing to do for a lot of students who perhaps want to get their issues heard by the administration," Nolan said.
The history of student referenda at Harvard has featured issues of local and global importance. In 1958, three students petitioned to gauge undergraduate opinion on Harvard’s membership in the United States National Student Association. That same year, another referendum sought to up Council membership to 30 representatives, a third of whom would be appointed rather than elected.
The referendum process has not been without its share of controversies. In 1994, a referendum proposed to eliminate a $10 hike to the student term bill but failed twice due to a melange of complications, including alleged intimidation by Council members, unsecured ballots, and insufficient votes.
Regardless of whether or not the three referenda pass Friday, Sim said she was excited about the conversations they have inspired.
"I’m really grateful for the incredible attention and the momentum that the students have been putting into it," Sim said."I have been hearing about the different referenda just from walking by, overhearing people talking about it."

Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds said this week that Harvard is nowhere close to making the changes to the school’s sexual assault policy advocated in an open student referendum, regardless of whether the motion passes when voting concludes Friday.
"I think the referendum questions need a great deal of further study," Hammonds said. "Certainly, I’ve said that to the students who prepared the referendum."
The sexual assault question, one of three referendum questions on this year’s UC presidential ballot, calls for the College to revise its policies for sexual assault cases. The referendum advocates requiring “affirmative consent” to sex, specifying a definition of “mental incapacitation,” adopting more BGLTQ-inclusive language, and making the case review process more transparent.
Regardless of whether the referendum is passed, Hammonds said that the issue of adjudicating sexual assault deserves more study before the College considers adopting the proposal.
"I think people come to it with good intentions, but there’s a lot of work that needs to be done before it becomes the basis for changes," she said.
For UC President Danny P. Bicknell ’13, the referendum is a stepping stone to directly influence College policy—or at the very least, spur student involvement in conversations among administrators on how the College handles sexual assault cases.
"It’s a great opportunity not only to address what students are talking about now, but also to involve them in what the University is doing," he said. "The whole community is involved right now and they should be staying involved in the entire process."
The College’s policy was last revised in 2003, when Harvard eliminated a controversial requirement for "sufficient corroborating evidence" and instituted new resources and educational programs on campus.
More recently, an investigation by the U.S Department of Education Office for Civil Rights into Harvard Law School’s sexual assault policy, along with guidelines issued by the agency recommending a standard of evidence different than that of Harvard, has drawn attention to Harvard’s sexual assault policy.
This semester, a widely circulated article in the Amherst Student, the college’s student-run newspaper, in which a student said that she had been sexually assaulted and that Amherst had discouraged her from reporting it, sparked dialogue among administrators in University Hall about how well Harvard’s policies are serving its students, according to Hammonds.
"Of course whenever that kind of incident happens and there’s national attention brought to the issue of sexual assault, it gives pause to everyone to think about whether or not their own policies are meeting the needs of their own constituency and community. So I think that’s to be expected," Hammonds said.
Bicknell praised College administrators for being proactive in addressing sexual assault policies, particularly in the context of the Amherst incident.“You just never want an article like that,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“There’s no place I’d rather be than in a roomful of educators,” said Doug Lemov in the first words of his talk at the Harvard Graduate School of Education’s Askwith Forum on Thursday evening.
Lemov, author of the New York Times best seller "Teach Like a Champion," currently serves as a managing director for Uncommon Schools, a nonprofit organization that started and now manages 32 urban and high poverty charter schools.
He followed his opening with a graphic relating income level in a school district with its students’ success on standardized tests.
"There’s a lot of concern about the notion that zip code can be such a massive effect on educational outcomes," Lemov said.
But what Lemov was really interested in, and what drove him to develop his "49 Techniques that put Students on the Path to College," were the exceptions to the rule.
"What about those people?" Lemov asked, referring to teachers who buck the statistical trends. "We haven’t really been diligent enough about finding out what makes them different and good."
To answer this question, Lemov sought out those successful teachers and videotaped them in the classroom. He was looking for concrete strategies that could be taught to other teachers.
One example is the cold call: when the teacher randomly calls on students to confirm that everyone has mastered the material.
Emphasizing the importance of practicing this and other techniques, Lemov compared the process to a musician mastering a set of scales before performing in a symphony.
"You build up to a complex performance by mastering a series of basics," he said.
Expressing his hope for the next generation of teachers, Lemov said, "Our greatest assets are the people who make the biggest differences in our students’ lives. They’re our opportunity to get better."
Allison Fleischner, an elementary school teacher in Lawrence, Mass., said her school gave new teachers Lemov’s book during orientation.
"It was fun to watch him pull out the great moments [from his book], because that’s the stuff that makes you feel good as a teacher," said Fleischner. "It’s nice to see a speaker that’s connecting in the way that a teacher connects."

Environmental activist Bill E. McKibben ’82, a former Crimson president, and writer Naomi Klein lambasted oil companies and promoted divestment from fossil fuel companies at Boston’s Orpheum Theater Thursday night.
In particular, McKibben said he viewed Harvard, whose student body is currently considering a divestment referendum, as having a special responsibility to take part in the fossil fuel divestment movement. "Harvard is the place, as much as any place, where we learned what was going on with climate change," McKibben said in a session with journalists before the event. "So where does Harvard, or MIT, get off not following through with that message?" The obligation to divest, he said, is "an absolutely special obligation, because they’re the ones who taught us what was going on."
McKibben also pointed to the pride Harvard takes in green initiatives on campus, saying "If you’re going to green the campus, by what logic do you not also green the portfolio? ...It’s not okay to have energy-wasting buildings, why is it okay to be making money off Exxon?"
Organized by 350.org, a group founded by McKibben and dedicated to cutting carbon dioxide emissions, the event Thursday targeted fossil fuel companies, whose business model, Klein said, "is to declare war on life on Earth."
"It’s the industry that’s trying to wreck the future," said McKibben, pointing to natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the 2012 Midwest drought as evidence that the problem of climate change was increasing.
McKibben and Klein pointed to three numbers in their event to support their points. The first was two, as in two degrees Celsius. "If the world officially believes anything about climate change," said McKibben," it’s that two degrees is too much" for the earth’s climate. McKibben said that, as of now, the temperature has already risen by one degree due to carbon emissions, and that if the earth puts more than 565 gigatons of carbon into the atmosphere (the second number), the temperature will rise another degree.
The third number, 2,795 gigatons, is the amount of carbon that McKibben said fossil fuel companies had in their reserves. “Unless we figure out a way to intervene, it’s gonna be burnt,” said McKibben.
In order to halt this occurence, McKibben and Klein prescribed starting with divestment. "If it’s wrong to wreck the climate, then it’s wrong to profit from that wreckage," said McKibben.
Although many stark predictions were voiced last night, McKibben pointed to the enthusiastic crowd of volunteers as cause for hope. "I can’t guarantee that we’re going to win, but I gotta say, looking around the Orpheum Theater tonight, I really like our odds," said McKibben.
The event was one of 21 in a nationwide tour organized by 350.org to promote divestment. But, as Naomi Klein said, "it’s not gonna end with divestment. By the end, anybody who takes fossil fuel money is gonna have to justify themselves."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds has tasked a committee with finding ways to relieve stress for overburdened undergraduates.
"It became clear to me that we at the College needed to think about whether or not we were providing enough support for students to address their stress," Hammonds said. "It’s something that permeates the air here, that people are always stressed out, and I don’t think that’s a good thing."
The Workgroup on Student Stress—which is composed of a total of 22 administrators, House Masters, faculty members, students, and health experts—met for the first time last week. The committee will spend the next several months identifying stressors in the Harvard community and will then release a report recommending solutions in the spring, Hammonds said.
Adams House Master Judith S. Palfrey ’67, who co-chairs the working group with director of Harvard University Health Services Paul J. Barreira, wrote in an email that she expects the report to be released publicly.
Members of the group have already begun collecting data on sources of student stress. Last week, Mather House Master Michael D. Rosengarten, who sits on the committee, circulated an online poll over his House’s email list asking Matherites to rate student stress levels and rank their most significant stressors.
The question of how to support student wellbeing on campus has been raised in public discussions between administrators and students throughout the semester.
In October, University President Drew G. Faust told an audience at Kirkland House that student mental health was "very much on [the] minds" of Harvard administrators. Earlier this month, Hammonds said at the Harvard College Governance Panel that administrators were taking those issues seriously.
Eliot House Master Gail A. O’Keefe said that while she believes that Harvard offers a sufficient number of resources to help alleviate student stress, she hopes to see the committee find ways to better direct students toward the appropriate resources for different types of anxiety.
"I don’t think that a lot of students recognize the differences between all these resources, and when to go to one or to the other," O’Keefe said.
And though Undergraduate Council President Danny P. Bicknell ’13 lauded administrators for prioritizing the issue, he said he thinks that some level of stress is inevitable on campus.
"Harvard students are always going to be overcommitted. I’m not exactly sure how you can resolve that, so it’s more of how you go about being overcommitted but also managing healthy stress," Bicknell said.

The Student Activities Fee, and with it the College’s termbill, should rise in order to better fund student groups, the Undergraduate Council recommended in a report released last Sunday.
The report, spearheaded by UC President Danny P. Bicknell ’13 and UC Vice President Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13, calls for an increase in the Student Activities Fee, a portion of the yearly termbill totaling $75 per person which the UC uses to fund student groups, club sports teams, campus events, and House Committees.
These recommendations come in a year when the UC depleted its grants funding completely, the first time that happened in recent memory, according to Bicknell.
“We had to cut grants by 80 percent in the last grants package," he said. “We’re in a really tight spot, and it’s unfortunate for student groups."
The last time the Student Activities Fee rose was in 2006. According to Yalamanchi, the average fee at Harvard’s peer institutions is $190. Some schools, such as Brown and Stanford, have much higher fees—$214 and $357, respectively.
The increase the report calls for, if approved, would take effect in 2014 and would raise the fee from $75 to "somewhere between $115 to $160," said Yalamanchi.
Bicknell and Yalamanchi launched a working group on campus funding last year. Meeting with groups involved with funding such as club sports teams and College deans, the group examined sources of funding and developed recommendations that, apart from the Student Activities Fee increase, were meant to improve the distribution of funds.
In addition to advocating for increased sources of revenue, the report suggests that the UC replace physical checks with online transfers and that different funding bodies, such as the Phillips Brooks House Association, synchronize their deadlines to simplify the application process for student groups.
Assistant Dean of Student Life Emelyn A. dela Peña said she is proud of the work that has gone into the report and sees providing more resources to student organizations as a "good thing for student life."
"The data supports the need for increasing the Student Activities Fee," she said. "However, I think that we need to research more about how it is going to affect financial aid, how is it going to affect students—particularly our hi-fi [high financial aid] students, and how is it going to affect the finances of the College. There are a lot of moving pieces."
The actual increase in the Student Activities fee will be announced once the Harvard Corporation and Financial Aid Office agree on an amount, though at this point, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds is "very much in favor" of adopting the report’s findings, according to Yalamanchi.
"Our money has been stretched in so many different ways," said Yalamanchi. "The original purpose of grants was to facilitate student life, but right now we’re only able to subsidize it."

Just across the street from Felipe’s on Mt. Auburn, floor-to-ceiling windows cluttered with a panchromatic mix of real and painted books mark the arrival of a new venue in The Square. Through the decals and tomes can be glimpsed an inflatable mylar cube, intended to help draw curious passersby inside to participate—or just partake—in what the Library Test Kitchen calls a "pop-up library."
"The Labrary," as the space is called, is a product of a seminar at the Harvard Graduate School of Design focused on exploring opportunities to redesign traditional libraries and learning settings.
The opening of The Labrary, the final product of the students’ work, took place Thursday night with talks from co-teacher Jeffrey Schnapp and senior associate provost for the Harvard Library Mary Lee Kennedy.
"We call it a Harvard library experiment," said Jeff Goldenson, a co-teacher of The Library Test Kitchen seminar. "The Harvard library is in transition and it’s changing a lot, so we wanted to set up a space where the students could say and show how it should be changing. And in the spirit of that we got this space to experiment with and see what a library could be," Goldenson said.
The Library Test Kitchen, now in its second year, is funded by The Harvard Innovation Lab. The seminar aims to serve not just as an engine of local change for Harvard’s 73 libraries, but as a model of innovation for libraries worldwide.
“This is just a perfect example of how students, librarians, and faculty are discovering this space together in this age and how we make integrating technology meaningful in terms of research and teaching,” said Kennedy at Thursday’s launch event. “I’m just thrilled to be even a small part of this.”
The Labrary features numerous student projects—typewriters, books with hidden speakers, and most noticeably, a billowing mylar den.
"It’s an inflatable reading room that can pop up anywhere around the Harvard community, and we wanted to get some kind of wow factor when people were passing by on the street," said Ben Brady, a co-instructor of The Library Test Kitchen.
According to Schnapp, The Labrary will have a very full events calendar, with events ranging from installations to "urban design poetry slam sessions."
"This project began with focused ambitions, but it has taken on a life of its own," said Schnapp. "This is a place for experimentation and fun, but serious fun—fun that involves thinking about the possibilities and both the challenges and opportunities that are involved in building a learning space and rethinking what a library is as an institution."
"We wanted it to be a workshop with people coming in and out," said Arielle Assouline-Lichten, a student at the Graduate School of Design currently taking The Library Test Kitchen seminar.
The Labrary will be open from 11 am to 7 pm Monday through Friday until December 21. It is open to all students and members of the community as a place to study, engage with student projects, hold meetings and events, or even as a spot to lie on a bean bag in between classes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With two fierce rivals taking the field in the Harvard-Yale game on Saturday, athletes might be more concerned with defending their school’s honor than staying safe. However, in Thursday’s lecture "Leadership on the Road to a Safer Game," Roger Goodell, the commissioner of the National Football League (NFL), expressed his hope that people will reconsider this "warrior mentality."
Goodell spoke at the Harvard School of Public Health, discussing the NFL’s commitment to achieving greater safety.
In light of increased focus on concussions and other medical trauma in today’s athletics, Goodell hopes to emphasize the importance of athletes’ well-being, while still maintaining a competitive spirit.
"My commitment has been and will continue to be to change the culture of football to better protect players without changing the essence of what makes the game so popular," Goodell said.
According to Goodell, concussions affect more than 30 million athletes in the United States.
Still, he remains hopeful about changing safety measures. According to Goodell, football was the victim of mass criticism in 1905 after 18 student athletes suffered fatal injuries. As a result, President Theodore Roosevelt, class of 1880, summoned representatives from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton to the White House to discuss potential safety reforms.
"President Roosevelt recognized the game didn’t need to end; it needed to evolve," Goodell said.
With this same hope for improvement in mind, the NFL is supporting brain injury research by committing $30 million to the National Institutes of Health.
The NFL has also made a number of recent changes to its rules, including moving the kickoff line five yards forward, which decreased the concussion rate during kickoffs by 40 percent. Next year, players will be required to wear knee and thigh pads.
Accelerometers in helmets and sensors in shoulder pads are currently being tested to gather information about the mechanism of injury. Perhaps most significantly, Goodell said, medical staff are using video recordings to more quickly and more effectively treat injuries.
Goodell hopes the NFL will continue to be an advocate for safety across all fields. Some Ivy League teams have already adopted similar policies.
"I have never been more optimistic about football’s future," he said. “Optimistic, but not complacent.”

A group of roughly 30 people protested on Friday afternoon on behalf of Johany Pilar, a mailroom worker who says that she was sexually harassed by a co-worker.
In an address to the protesters, Pilar told her story about how a male co-worker grabbed her on several occasions and said he wanted to kiss her. After a few supporters gave additional speeches over a microphone outside the Holyoke Center, the group circled the plaza and chanted.
“We need help from you all,” Pilar said.
At the end of the rally, she expressed her appreciation to those who had gathered on her behalf.
“I would like to say thank you,” Pilar said. “I just want justice. That’s it.”
As part of the rally, the protesters entered the Yard and marched around Massachusetts Hall, which houses University President Drew G. Faust’s office. Pilar and Geoff P. Carens, Pilar’s union representative and a Harvard library assistant, handed an employee at Massachusetts Hall a signed letter that included Pilar’s story and was addressed to Faust. The group subsequently moved to circle the Science Center, the building containing the mailroom where Pilar works.
“I think we’re really getting out there in the public eye,” said Carens, who helped organize the rally, led many of the chants, and introduced the speakers.
Pilar has alleged that last spring, a man working with her in the mailroom said he wanted to kiss her and twice grabbed her face. Weeks later, Pilar said, he grabbed her hand.
Pilar said that after she reported the incidents, her managers threatened her with disciplinary action or termination and prevented her from leaving work to see a therapist. Pilar first publicly told her story at a panel on gender inequality and “rape culture” in mid-October. Friday’s event followed an initial rally on Pilar’s behalf last month.
University spokesperson Kevin Galvin has repeatedly declined to comment on the specific case, but he has said that Harvard takes allegations of sexual harassment seriously and “maintains a policy of non-retaliation” so that employees can come forward with complaints, which can then be investigated.
The letter, which Carens said garnered around 75 signatures, included demands that Pilar receive a new supervisor, a removal of disciplinary warnings from her file, and “an end to the pressure and threats.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One is a 6’5” former high school basketball star built like a wide receiver. The other is a 6’3” former high school track standout whose unique versatility has allowed him to play five positions on the gridiron. The former goes by a full name just eight letters long, while the latter has a surname only rivaled in Boston sports lore by “Yastrzemski” in its complexity.
Indeed, side-by-side, junior Cam Brate and senior Kyle Juszczyk would appear to be very different. But together, they have formed a dynamic duo at tight end for the Harvard football team that has often been a nightmare for opposing defenses to try to contain.
Both players broke out last season, when Juszczyk and Brate were named first- and second-team All-Ivy, respectively. But in 2012, each has taken his game to a whole new level. Juszczyk, a preseason All-American, leads the team in receptions, with 49, and yards, with 686. Brate is second on the squad in both those categories.
The two have established themselves as the go-to weapons on one of the top offenses in the FCS. In one game against Princeton this year, Juszczyk—nicknamed “Juice”—recorded 15 receptions for 192 yards and tied a program record with three touchdowns, while Brate hauled in seven catches for 109 yards and a score.
“Juice, being the absolute dominant force that he is out there, he’s all over the field, one, and two, he’ll just do about anything to put himself in position to make a catch—he’ll catch screens, he’ll catch a post behind you, and he’s athletic enough to take over a game whenever his number’s called,” says senior running back Treavor Scales. “As far as Cam goes, he’s literally a big-play machine.”
The paths each player took to get to that upper level were very different. Juszczyk played quarterback his freshman year of high school, but by the time he made the varsity team the following season, the squad had brought in a transfer quarterback who would be the starter for the next three years.
“I learned quickly I had to play different positions, and since then I’ve always done different things,” Juszczyk says.
The Medina, Ohio, native excelled as a running back and a wideout, leading his team in rushing and receiving as a senior. He then brought that versatility to Harvard, where he has played halfback, fullback, tight end, and slot receiver for the Crimson throughout his career. This season, he has even lined up at quarterback and taken snaps under center in goal-line situations.
“He’s a guy that can truly play all the positions,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy says.
Brate arrived in Cambridge a year after Juszczyk, but unlike his fellow tight end, he failed to make the varsity team his rookie season.
“When I came in, I was pretty much last on the depth chart, and Kyle was up at the top,” Brate says. “I [had played] receiver in high school, [and] I was like 215 pounds as a freshman, so I had my struggles.”
But in Juszczyk, Brate found someone who also had been unaccustomed to the tight end position early in his collegiate career, and Juszczyk became something of a mentor to the Naperville, Ill., native.
“Kyle has always been so good at teaching me the offense,” Brate says. “He was a returning starter coming into his sophomore year, so to have a guy like that to look up to as a freshman I think was really big in my development. I’m thankful for that.”
The following season, Brate made the varsity team and put what Juszczyk had taught him to good use, immediately establishing himself as a red-zone threat. In just his second career varsity game, the sophomore recorded a game-high 93 receiving yards and made an acrobatic one-handed touchdown grab to help Harvard beat Brown and start a winning streak that would become the longest in Division I.
“I thank Coach for giving me the chance,” Brate says. “The biggest thing for me has always been gaining weight.... I gained 25 pounds that offseason. The extra weight and extra confidence really helped me be able to compete at the college level.”
Brate continued to shine throughout the season, tying his mentor with a team-high seven touchdowns. Juszczyk, meanwhile, led the team in receptions while establishing himself as one of the most dynamic players in the league. The then-junior capped his season with seven receptions for 107 yards and a 60-yard touchdown against Yale and later earned the College Football Performance Award as the top tight end in the FCS.
“Juice was able to play a little bit more receiver, which I know he was really thankful for,” Brate says. “He’s so versatile; having him on our offense really opened things up for everyone.”
This season, both players went right to work establishing themselves as senior quarterback Colton Chapple’s go-to targets.
Juszczyk had seven catches for 86 yards in this year’s contest against the Bears, while Brate had eight for 72. In the following game, against Holy Cross, Brate scored two touchdowns and Juszczyk had one in the highest-scoring first half in Harvard history.
Two weeks later, each had a touchdown against Bucknell, including a 59-yard score by Juszczyk in which he shed one would-be tackler, bounced off two more, and stiff-armed a fourth to the ground with ease before steamrolling into the end zone.
“As a little kid, I was told it will hurt less if you hit them before they hit you, so I just tried to stick by that,” Juszczyk said after the game.
That mentality has allowed the tight end to break innumerable tackles during his Crimson career. And while he and Brate have continued to shine on the field, they have also become close off of it.
“That’s kind of unique because I think most people would look at the roster, and it says tight end for both of us, so you’d think we’d be more in competition with each other than friends,” Juszczyk says. “But it’s turned out to be the complete opposite.”
Both players believe that their off-field relationship has improved their on-field performance.
“We’re always on the same page,” Brate says. “If there’s ever a question either of us has to ask on the fly, we can always turn to each other.... Just having that on the field helps me a lot in making adjustments during games.”
“We’re competition in that we push each other,” Juszczyk adds. “I think that competition has brought us close, and I think we work really well together on the field because of that.”
But with Juszczyk’s Crimson career coming to an end—he hopes to play in the NFL next year—Murphy is already dreading trying to replace his star tight end.
“We’re constantly trying to find the next Kyle Juszczyk, and it may be many years before we do,” Murphy says. “He’s going to go down as one of the legendary players in Harvard history.”
And when it’s his turn to graduate, Brate’s presence will be missed as well.
“Cam is one of those guys who’s always there for a lighthearted contribution, and it’s truly appreciated by all of us,” Scales says. “He’s just awesome at what he does.”
Indeed, with just one game remaining to utilize its dynamic two tight-end set, the team is well aware that it has been very lucky to be able to feature such a package at all.
“It’s a luxury we aren’t going to have forever,” Murphy says. “[We know] everybody would love to have two great tight ends the way we do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A season ago, the Harvard football team dismantled Yale in the 128th iteration of The Game, scoring 45 unanswered points in a 45-7 rout of the Bulldogs at the Yale Bowl.
The Crimson enters this year’s contest on Saturday at Harvard Stadium heavily favored once again, but perhaps The Game’s most intriguing storyline comes from off the field.
Following former Yale coach Tom Williams’ resignation after the 2011 season, the Bulldogs hired former Harvard assistant Tony Reno, who then brought three former Harvard coaches with him to New Haven.
Since then, Reno and his staff have worked to reshape a struggling Yale (2-7, 1-5 Ivy) program that has only beaten Harvard (7-2, 4-2) once in its last 11 tries. And according to Harvard coach Tim Murphy, the Yale systems look quite familiar.
“It’s the Harvard offense. It’s the Harvard defense. It’s that simple.” Murphy says.
That could inject some added intensity into the year’s most anticipated game.
“Everyone definitely…has a little chip on their shoulder,” said senior center Jack Holuba before the start of the season. “It’s a testament to the program Coach Murphy built that the dreaded rival would sell their soul to the devil and eventually want to buy the Harvard system.”
But Murphy maintains that the four coaches’ departures won’t change things on Saturday.
“It’s not about guys who have left the program,” Murphy says. “That’s ancient history. We moved on a long time ago, and therefore, as far as we’re concerned, it’s a non-factor.”
For Harvard, Saturday’s contest also could have Ivy title implications. But after last week’s 30-21 loss at Penn, the Crimson’s fate is out of its hands: only a Harvard win coupled with a Quakers loss to Cornell could guarantee the Crimson a share of the Ivy League title.
Harvard, however, may not need that extra motivation on Saturday.
In almost every team statistic, Yale sits at or near the bottom of the league. The Bulldogs’ per-game averages of 14.9 points, 163.4 passing yards, and 27:59 time of possession all rank last in the league, and their 29.7 points allowed per contest is seventh in the Ancient Eight.
Meanwhile, Harvard ranks second in passing yards (280.3), third in time of possession (30:12), and first in both points allowed (16.7) and points scored per game (40.0). The team needs just 15 points to break the modern-era program record, which it set last season.
“[Harvard is] a tremendous football team in all areas,” Reno says. “They don’t have a weakness there. They’re every bit as good as advertised.”
Yale’s most glaring weakness is its inconsistency at the quarterback position. First-string freshman Eric Williams is sidelined with injury, and junior John Whitelaw, last season’s backup, quit the team at the start of the year after being passed over for the starting job in favor of Williams. Though Reno says he may make a game-time decision regarding Saturday’s starter, it will likely be either senior Derek Russell or junior Hank Furman. Both are listed on the roster as wide receivers.
On the year, the two have completed 35 of their 61 passes for 330 yards combined. Furman had the better statistical game of the two a week ago against Princeton, when, as the starter, he threw for 184 yards and a touchdown on 18-of-28 passing.
The Bulldogs are strongest offensively on the ground, as sophomore running back Tyler Varga leads the league with 119.9 rushing yards per game in his first year in the Ivy League.
Varga and Yale will face off against a stout Crimson defensive line that leads the FCS with 41 sacks and is second with 63.8 rushing yards allowed per game. But in last week’s defeat, like much of the Crimson squad, the vaunted defensive line was shut down, held sackless for the first time on the year while allowing 227 rushing yards.
“[Penn] did a great job scheming us up,” says fifth-year senior defensive end John Lyon. “They did some things in their scheme that didn’t allow us, the defensive linemen, to pin back our ears and just get after the quarterback.”
Offensively, Yale’s inexperience at the quarterback position forms a stark juxtaposition to that of Crimson senior Colton Chapple, who leads the league with a program-record 22 passing touchdowns and who Murphy called “probably the most valuable player in this league.”
Chapple has a number of weapons at his disposal. Tight ends senior Kyle Juszczyk and junior Cam Brate have 13 touchdowns and 1,236 yards receiving between them, while junior wide receivers Andrew Berg and Ricky Zorn have combined for nine touchdowns and 933 receiving yards.
And the Crimson is dangerous on the ground as well, leading the league in rushing yards per game. Senior running back Treavor Scales spearheads the ground attack for Harvard with 825 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns, but Chapple is also a threat to run, ranking seventh in the league in total rushing yards.
Regardless of Scales and Chapples’ performance on Saturday, The Game will mark the seniors’ last contest in a Harvard uniform.
“All those offseason lifts, all those early mornings, those late-night film sessions, those hot afternoons passing, it’s just so many things you reflect upon when you hit that field for the last time that it’s a very emotional day,” Scales says. “To have it against Yale is obviously a true pleasure…. Nationally televised, it’s just great to have student support out there, your family comes up…. It’s just astronomical. I love it.”

Coming into his senior year, Harvard running back Treavor Scales wasn’t satisfied.
“This last season wasn’t everything that I wanted it to be,” said the senior before the start of the year. “I’m just looking forward to just hitting my stride.”
With an Ivy League Rookie of the Year title under his belt, a team-high 816 rushing yards in 2011, and All-Ivy League selections every year of his career, no one could deny the success that Scales had entering his last season as a Crimson tailback.
But the running back may have saved his best for last—and hit his stride in his final year in a Harvard uniform.
“Treavor’s had a tremendous year,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy says. “We’re a very balanced and multiple-offense [team], so we don’t just rely on the running game, but we’ve got the best running back in the Ivy League, the most complete player, and a great leader.”
With only The Game remaining, the tailback has cemented his place in Harvard’s record books. Scales has 12 rushing touchdowns this year, four more than his previous personal best. With his touchdown against Penn on Saturday, the back is now tied with Clifton Dawson ’07 for fifth place in Harvard history in single-season rushing touchdowns. He also has tallied 825 yards this year, moving ahead of Gino Gordon ’11  and into the fourth-place spot on the career rushing yards list in the Crimson record book. Against the league’s second-worst rushing defense in Yale, Scales will have one more chance to pad that total.
But for Scales, The Game—and the record—aren’t the most valuable takeaways from his last season.
“As far as the record goes, [Gordon] said if anybody broke it, he’d rather it be me, and it meant a lot for him to say that,” Scales says. “But to be honest, it wasn’t even a goal on my mind at the beginning of the season; it was just to have fun. This [record] is just the result of having fun.”
During his first two collegiate seasons, the Stone Mountain, Ga., native was behind Gordon on the depth chart, and split time the following season with then-freshman running back Zach Boden. Now, in his senior year, with Gordon having graduated and Boden out for the year, Scales is unquestionably the go-to back for Harvard.
Scales had an explosive start to his final season in a Crimson uniform, averaging 130 yards per game and scoring six touchdowns during the first three games of the year. Although his numbers have since waned, he is still averaging over 90 yards in each contest, and the drop is something Murphy attributes to his team’s balanced offense.
“Our philosophy is to be balanced and take what people give us,” Murphy says. “We try to keep [Scales] fresh and healthy as well, and the combination of those [aspects] has led to a really outstanding season.”
For those who have practiced with Scales day in and day out since his arrival at Harvard, his success has not been surprising.
“It has to go back to how hard Treavor works,” says senior offensive lineman Jack Holuba. “The hours he puts in, watching film, [and] how hard he worked with us in the summer, it clearly shows that he’s such a mature back. He completely understands what the offense is trying to do—he protects, he runs hard, and he’s one of those guys that everybody on the team loves.”
The team may love Scales, but they hate bringing him down in practice.
“We do try to tackle him [in practice] when we go against him in pass protection,” Lyon says. “And that’s one of those times where he’s definitely tough to take down.... Usually it’s a lot easier to tackle a running back, but Treavor’s always going to put in his nose and get you on each and every play, and he loves to do it.”
Scales may have rushed for his career high this season, but his impact on the team transcends his ability to run and block on the field.
“Treavor’s one of those guys who can speak with such conviction because you know it’s genuine,” Holuba says. “When he talks about what we have to do that week [or] what we have to play, when Treavor talks, you listen. You know he means it, and his play speaks for himself.”
The senior is known for being the center of energy on the team, uniting the players, and leading the group through the fight song before games. Scales, whom both Holuba and Lyon cite as someone who “leads by example,” not only pumps the squad up during the pre-game rituals, but also holds the coveted position of giving the final speech.
“The main message is that you just don’t quit,” says Scales of the talk he gives. “It’s not always going to be smooth sailing in regards to the game, and you have to be able to deal with the adversity and really be able to battle through it. I’m glad that that pregame speech the last minute before we hit the field really embodies that.”
Although Scales is about to play his last game in Harvard Stadium, his legacy and impact on the younger backs will remain with the Crimson even after he graduates.
“I don’t even know if it’s a true mentor-mentee relationship rather than just students learning the game together,” Scales said. “I’m a very passionate guy, and I want to bring that passion to others and let them know that they need to be really excited to play this game because the next down is in front of us, and you really have to go all out for that reason.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the lead up to The Game we had writers from The Harvard Crimson and the Yale Daily News offer their take on the age-old rivalry. Below is the YDN's take. You can find the Brother's Samuels of The Crimson's column here.
On September 15, a brand new Yale football team took the field in our nation’s capital to play Georgetown. In the words of Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran, everything had changed. New coach, new quarterback, new season.
Admittedly, I didn’t have high expectations. I didn’t expect a win. I’m not sure if anyone did—except for the players and first-year head coach Tony Reno.
But what I saw that day was an energetic, talented performance. Freshman quarterback Eric Williams performed admirably, going 19-for-30 for 250 yards and a touchdown. Junior Cameron Sandquist had a 98-yard catch for a touchdown that will go down in the Bulldog record books as the longest play from scrimmage in Yale history. Canadian transfer sophomore Tyler Varga exploded onto the scene with two rushing TDs and over 100 yards on the ground. The Elis grabbed the lead at the end of the third quarter and never let go. I left D.C. excited—and happily proven wrong
My enthusiasm hasn’t yet faded. Sure, the young Bulldogs have struggled since. Mistakes were inevitable. Williams got injured. But there were still flashes of greatness. Varga continued to dominate. Yes, Yale may have only won one Ivy contest so far this season, but it was against Penn, the top dog in the Ancient Eight. And it wasn’t even close.
I wouldn’t blame you for thinking that things look bleak for The Game (or if you’re a Crimson reader, maybe you think there’s blood in the water): 2–7 isn’t exactly confidence inspiring. The top quarterbacks are still hurt. Varga didn’t play last week.
But take heart, Elis, and have a little faith. Pessimism and cynicism do you no good. Cantabs (apparently no one calls you that—I don’t care): It’s in your best interest to back off your expectations of a blowout. Just when it looks like Yale is down and a few seconds away from being KO’ed, this team has the power to surprise.
No one expected a win against Georgetown. No one expected a win against Penn. Nate Silver probably wouldn’t predict a Yale win against Harvard, but clearly football is a lot more volatile than a presidential election (note: not an attempt at a veiled value judgment). The world’s most famous statistician attempted to predict all 14 NFL games this weekend and went 9-for-13 (I’m giving him a break and eliminating the wonky 49ers-Rams tie). Take that, Mr. 50-for-50.
The Game is another chance for a defining win, just like those wins at Georgetown and against Penn. And everyone on this Yale team knows that. They know that 2–7 will look and feel like 10–0 if they can break the Yale losing streak. They’re hungry, Harvard’s not. After their loss to Penn last weekend, the Crimson is dejected, knowing that they need help from Penn to claim a share of the Ivy League title.
Meanwhile, this bruised and battered Bulldog team will make the most of the pieces they have on Saturday—and they won’t go down easily.
This guy—Tyler Varga—bounces off defenders like he’s inside a pinball machine. You have to see him run. He’s already a top-10 rusher in the FCS (tops in all-purpose yards) and I can’t wait to see what he’ll do next.
Mordecai Cargill—the senior running back—can break off a 10-yard run like it’s nothing. Last year, he ran for 230 yards against Columbia—in the midst of New York Snowpocalypse 2011.
And this defensive front seven—junior Beau Palin and seniors Chris Dooley, Nick Daffin, Dylan Drake, Brian Leffler, Will McHale, and Ryan Falbo—is a monster in the crucial moments. They stopped Columbia on four straight plays when the Lions had first down at the Yale one-yard-line. It’s a tough, experienced group.
So maybe, just maybe, just when it looks like our chances against the Crimson have hit a nadir, just when a sixth straight loss seems inevitable, just when apathy toward The Game seems to be rising, the Bulldogs have the power to surprise and reverse a forgettable half-decade of football. Don’t count them out—and yes, that’s directed toward Elis and Cantabs alike.

In the lead up to The Game we had writers from The Harvard Crimson and the Yale Daily News offer their take on the age-old rivalry. Below is The Crimson's take. You can find Evan Frondorf of the YDN's column here. 
Did you know that The Game used to be a rivalry?
A long time ago, it was a back-and-forth battle between two great Ivy League football powers in a nationally recognized showdown of brains and brawn.
On Saturday, Harvard vs. Yale will just be an embarrassment. Like Yale football coaches vs. The Truth (or the Rhodes Trust—either one). Like New Haven vs. A Safe Place To Live. Or like Fareed Zakaria vs. Journalism.
Honestly, this isn’t fun anymore.
Over the past decade, Yale’s been getting more hammered at The Game than most of the freshmen there. And now, the Harvard-Yale rivalry is like taking candy from a baby. Except babies have some hand-eye coordination and are not last in the Ivy League in time of possession.
And things don’t appear to be getting any better for our friends down in New Haven.
If you’ll indulge us for a moment, let’s a take a brief trip down Memory Lane.
[Please note that we don’t actually encourage any of our New Haven readers to walk down any street at any time after 6 p.m. It is not safe.]
It’s a classic tale, really: coach allegedly lies on his resume, resigns, and leaves his already struggling football program in an even greater situation of desperation. Then, this past spring, you steal a number of Harvard coaches, who head south to New Haven.
A brief aside: The Crimson is not in the business of questioning the decisions that individual members of our community, past or present, make. However, leaving Cambridge to go to New Haven is like a Dane Cook comedy tour: Maybe it seemed cool in 2006, but it’s 2012. Come on, Tony Reno. Sure, you’re the captain of the ship that is Yale football, but that ship is up in flames, sinking pretty quickly, and everyone is already on life boats.
You might be thinking: Hey, it can’t get any worse for Yale football. In movies, that would be the moment when it starts raining. In real life, that’s when your captain allegedly assaults a former Yale Daily News sports writer at Toad’s Place.
Another brief aside: Seriously? Sure, bar fights are cool. But purportedly giving a sportswriter 14 stitches is really no accomplishment. Our 13-year-old sister intimidates us to no end, and some say that we’re the muscle of the Sports Board of The Harvard Crimson. Okay, no one says that. But you get our point.
And lest you forget, all of this has happened before Yale even had the chance to botch a single snap.
But botch they have. Your quarterbacks are going down so fast that we don’t even have time to come up with a prom joke that does it justice. Regardless of who starts, the likely quarterback will be listed as a wide receiver and will have spent at least the past two years on the JV team (did you even know there was a JV team?). Both dudes have spent more time under center playing Madden than in real life. Word on the street is that Hank Furman’s most impressive athletic accomplishment was going 3-for-4 as himself in Backyard Baseball 2001.
Now, we were going to go week-by-week and offer incisive football analysis. But you lost to Columbia, so instead, we are going to continue mocking you.
Columbia? Seriously? Harvard beat them 69-0 with the fourth stringers in. And you lost?
We understand New York City can be distracting, what with its running water, street lights, and night clubs where the captain of your team isn’t allegedly punching sports writers. But there’s no real excuse to lose to a team whose bold vision is not to lose by 69 to Harvard next year (that’s actually what the Columbia coach promised).
We do hope that one day, Harvard and Yale can forge a truly great football rivalry once again. But for now, here’s some advice for you, Coach Reno: As an exciting halftime promotion, pick one lucky student from the stands. Have him start the second half as quarterback. By attending a couple high school football games, he would likely be the most experienced healthy quarterback on your roster.
Seriously, give it a shot. Because things literally cannot get any worse.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At what point does rock truly hit bottom?
For the Yale football program, that’s not an easy question to answer.
Things started turning dramatically downhill last season, when Bulldogs head coach Tom Williams—apparently jealous over the attention his quarterback, Patrick Witt, was getting over his Rhodes interview vs. The Game “dilemma”—decided to state that he too had faced a similar decision during his time as an undergraduate at Stanford.
There was only one problem: Tom Williams is about as trustworthy as a New Haven street after sundown, and the New York Times later reported he actually hadn’t been a Rhodes candidate at all.
Not sure what was going through Williams’ head here. Did he not realize the Rhodes Committee maintained basic standards of record-keeping or that the Times employed fact-checkers? Was he actually referring to the “Roads Scholarship,” a $500 offer by Pat the Digital Vagabond for any talented traveler/writer/photographer to go to the Burning Man Festival? Or, like Leonard in Memento, could he just not remember anything before a certain date?
No matter Williams’ explanation, nobody was surprised by his dreadful decision-making skills. This was the same guy who just two years earlier thought it would be a good idea to call a fake punt on a 4th-and-22 from his own 25-yard line with a three-point lead and 2:25 to go in the 2010 edition of The Game, helping the Crimson pull off a dramatic comeback win.
If you Google “Harvard Yale fake punt,” terms like “ghastly fake punt faux pas,”  “idiocy in the Ivy,” and “the absolute worst coaching decision ever” come up in titles of articles on the first three pages alone, which pretty much sums things up. Being surprised by “resume-gate” after that decision would have been like being surprised by the Petraeus affair if two years ago he had decided to randomly invade Sweden.
But the strange ménage à trois between Yale football, the Times, and the Rhodes committee was not over yet, as the following week the paper reported that the Rhodes Trust had learned of sexual assault accusations against Witt and had decided to suspend his own application unless Yale re-endorsed him.
Taking a page out of Williams ol’ “Pinocchio Playbook,” Witt told the media he had withdrawn his Rhodes application on his own, when in reality the committee had already taken the liberty of doing that for him.
Here again, Google tells the whole story. When you search “Patrick Witt Yale,” articles come up entitled “Sex Smears and the Rule of Law at Yale,” “Pat Witt and Yale’s Disastrous Failure,” “Yale QB’s Deception over Rhodes Scholarship is an Embarrassment,” “Yale’s Unforgiveable Silence on Patrick Witt,” and, worst of all, “Tom Williams (American football) Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.” So yeah, you guys might want to try out Bing for a bit.
Anyway, Williams resigned and Witt went on to work for the Romney campaign, which to nobody’s surprise apparently found the ability to grossly misstate the truth to be a positive job qualification. No word on what Witt plans to do next; perhaps Yale alum and fellow truth-slayer Fareed Zakaria is looking for an intern.
Meanwhile, after making the worst pair of calls since the ones Mel Gibson made to his girlfriend, Williams was unable to find even a coordinator job. Instead, he became the safeties coach at UTEP. Upon hiring Williams, Miners head coach Mike Price said that “The fact that he was head coach at Yale brings status and prestige to our program,” which is kind of like Trek hiring Lance Armstrong as its spokesperson and saying “The fact that he was a professional cyclist brings status and prestige to our program.”
In September, the El Paso Times reported that Williams gave the team a passionate speech to motivate it before its game at Wisconsin. The Miners lost that contest and five of its next six after that, proving once again that Tom Williams is about as good a motivator as the “You Can Do It” guy from ‘The Waterboy.’
Of course, both Williams and Witt were just following in the treasured Yale legacy of destroying one’s reputation. The trend began in 1692, when Elihu Yale was removed as President of Madras on corruption charges. In 1999, American Heritage magazine rated Elihu the most overrated philanthropist in American history, which remains the only time to this day anything related to Yale College ranks first on a “best in America” list.
Back in the present, the Bulldogs, as usual desperately trying to be Harvard, hired Crimson assistant Tony Reno to be their next coach.
But before the season had even begun, Reno’s captain, Will McHale, reportedly punched Yale Daily News sportswriter Marc Beck in the face during a fight at Toad’s and fled the scene. According to a witness, the attack came after McHale threw a drink at a friend of Beck’s. Beck was left with 14 stitches and Yale was left without a captain for the first time in its long history. As a sportswriter who generally prefers not to be punched in the face by temperamental linebackers, I’ll avoid making a McHale joke here. But based on his drink-throwing skills, it sounds like he would have been the best quarterback on the Bulldogs roster this season.
Instead, Reno chose to go with freshman Eric Williams, who’s neck-and-neck right now with Hurricane Sandy as the biggest natural disaster of the year. The rookie—seemingly as confused about what he was supposed to do at quarterback as David was after the dentist—is tied for first in the country with 2.0 interceptions per game, and his 1:2.3 TD:INT ratio is by far the worst in the nation.
Unfortunately, Reno didn’t have many other options to replace him, because preseason backup quarterback John Whitelaw quit the team after realizing that losing the starting job to Williams was like losing the 100 meter dash to a drunken, blind turtle.
Since then, the freshman has gotten hurt twice, as have his two backups, leaving the Bulldogs to turn to a three wide receiver set—two wideouts at wide receiver, and one under center. Despite some moderate success by Henry Furman last week, Yale of course lost, just as it has in seven of its nine games this season. The Bulldogs couldn’t even beat Columbia, which is akin to losing a game of Trivial Pursuit to Brick Tamland.
This Saturday, Yale travels to Harvard Stadium. They say in rivalry games that anything can happen, but sorry Forrest—sometimes in life you really do know what you’re going to get. And on Saturday, you’re going to get a Harvard win, and probably a Crimson blowout.
To put it simply, if you think the Bulldogs are going to win this game, you probably also think that Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are going to happily grow old together, that the YouTube comments section is an intelligent source of commentary on anything, and that signing a long-term contact with the Florida Marlins is a good idea.
As Stefon from Weekend Update would say if Yale football was New York’s hottest club, “this club has everything—college football’s worst starting quarterback, historically bad play-calling, bloody sportswriters, decrepit bulldogs, H.C.V.-positive coaches, resufakes, quarterwide receiverbacks, a city that’s the love child of a dumpster and a trash can, a Jumbled Folsom Prison Blues...”
Seth Meyers would interrupt, “What’s a Jumbled Folsom Prison Blues?”
And Stefon would say, “it’s that thing where, instead of shooting a man in Reno just to watch him die, Tim Murphy beats a man named Reno just to watch him cry.”
Because that’s what will happen tomorrow. And finally, when the Jumbled Folsom Prison Blues occurs, Yale will have at long last hit rock bottom.
COLUMBIA AT BROWN
There are 100 quarterbacks in the FCS who qualify for the league’s passer rating title. Columbia’s Sean Brackett ranks dead last. A word of advice to all coaches out there: in the future, when your quarterback is having a worse statistical season than Eric Williams (who’s 95th in that category), he probably shouldn’t be playing enough minutes to qualify for any statistical titles. I bet even Tom Williams knows that.
Pick: Brown 24, Columbia 13
PENN AT CORNELL
Like non-Jewish fans of Harvard Hillel, Cornell is coming off a major letdown this week after it was stunningly upset by the Lions. The Big Red was picked third in the Ivy preseason poll, but it has just two conference wins.
Meanwhile, by upsetting Harvard last Saturday, Penn became the first Ivy team to win a share of the Ivy title with at least four losses since E.T. was released in theaters—you know, when Drew Barrymore was still a cute little kid and not a 13-year-old with a cocaine addition. Kudos to the Quakers, who were the first squad to outplay the Crimson all season. Penn was more physical, dominated the trenches, and neutralized Harvard’s greatest strengths in what was truly an all-around impressive victory.
Here’s the problem: last Saturday, Penn lost starting quarterback Billy Ragone to a gruesome dislocated ankle. This week, the Quakers will be forced to start Andrew Holland, and Penn badly struggles to move the ball with Holland under center. Whether or not Jeff Mathews plays—he left last week’s game with an injury—it’s tough to see a Holland-led Penn offense going into Ithaca and outscoring Cornell.
Pick: Cornell 28, Penn 24
DARTMOUTH AT PRINCETON
The Tigers are still alive for a split title, which would be a great accomplishment for the team that was picked last in the Ivy preseason poll. Despite the Big Green’s solid year, it’s tough to see Princeton losing at home with so much potentially at stake.
Pick: Princeton 24, Dartmouth 20
YALE AT HARVARD
Simply put, as Harvard center Jack Holuba put it last year after the Crimson’s 45-7 thrashing of the Bulldogs, The Game has become “a little boring.” Harvard has won 10 of the last 11 meetings between the two squads, making this about as much of a rivalry as Don Draper vs. Pete Campbell.
In a recent interview with the YDN, Bulldogs running back Mordecai Cargill said Yale’s strategy this weekend would be “the same game plan we had all year.” If that’s the case, let’s just say that on Saturday nobody should plan any revelrous contests where you drink every time Harvard scores.
(Side note: the Cargill interviewer identified Yale as “we” in one of her questions. Apparently all of the YDN contributors who had any sense of journalistic integrity left after last year’s Witt cover-up have been successfully wiped off the face of the earth by reporter hunter Will McHale).
The Bulldogs could be without its top offensive threat, halfback Tyler Varga, and so things could get ugly early. In fact, the biggest question heading into this game is really not who will win, but rather whether Murphy will pull his starters when he’s up big in the third quarter, or leave them in to make Reno and his assistants feel worse about their decisions to leave Cambridge than they already do (if that’s even possible).
And it’s not just me saying that; for the first time in a while Yale hasn’t even been able to sell its own allocation of student tickets to The Game. As one Eli told the YDN, “It just didn’t seem worth it, since we are probably going to lose.” At least you’re self-aware, Yale. I’ll give you that.
On the whole, if all of the above results hold, we’re looking at a three-way tie for the Ivy crown—certainly not what Harvard would have wanted, nor what anybody would have expected a month ago, but it’s something, at least.
Pick: Harvard 52, Yale 0

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Harvard men’s basketball team squares off against Manhattan College this Friday at Lavietes Pavilion, it will be a meeting of two teams which both had historic postseason runs last season and are coached by magnetic figures who have reinvigorated their respective programs.
Both the Crimson (1-1) and the Jaspers (0-1) are fresh off of road losses. Harvard fell to UMass Monday, 67-64, on a buzzer beater televised on ESPN as part of the network’s Tip-Off Marathon.
“It was a tough loss but we thought we had played hard and done really well especially in the second half,” junior co-captain guard Laurent Rivard said. “We’re excited to step back on the court and get back on the winning track.”
Manhattan, on the other hand, was blown out on Sunday by home-favorite No. 2 Louisville, 79-51. The Cardinals are ranked second in the nation in the most recent AP poll, thanks in large part to a stingy defense that held Manhattan to just 35.7 percent shooting from the field.
Louisville guard Russ Smith led all scorers with 23 points on the night while junior Jaspers center Rhamel Brown was second with 18. Brown went 7-for-13 from the floor and 4-for-9 from the line. The co-captain posted a double-double, adding a career-high 15 rebounds. Junior guard Michael Alvarado was second on the team in scoring, with 13 points, nine of which came from the charity stripe.
Alvarado and sophomore forward Emmy Andujar were the sole providers of assists for Manhattan against Louisville. Alvarado had two in the game while Andujar finished with three dimes. The forward led the team with 105 last season, and was second in scoring, averaging 8.5 points per game.
Notably absent from the game was co-captain guard George Beamon, who has a badly sprained ankle and is not expected to return for the game on Friday, according to Jaspers coach Steve Masiello. The senior led the team in scoring last year with 19.1 points per game, the highest in the MAAC, and was expected to be a major threat in the backcourt before the injury.
The game against Louisville was a homecoming for Masiello, who joined Manhattan in 2011 after six years in Louisville as an assistant to Cardinals head coach Rick Pitino. Masiello played for Pitino as a guard at Kentucky from 1996 to 2000. During his career, the Wildcats made it to the Final Four twice and won the national title outright in the 1997-98 season.
Upon his arrival in Riverdale, Masiello quickly revived the program with the largest turnaround in the nation, improving upon the previous season’s record by 15 wins. The team went 21-13 overall and 12-6 in the MAAC. Against Ivy League opponents Manhattan posted a win against Brown while falling to Penn and cross-town Columbia. The Jaspers dropped their first-round conference tournament game to Siena College in overtime, 84-82, but still appeared in their first postseason tournament, the CIT, in six years.
Manhattan comes to Cambridge to face off a Crimson team which erased a second half deficit only to be stunned by a last-second three by the Minutemen.
“We see that we’re capable of going into an opponent’s arena, a very good basketball team, a team that’s going to do very well this year,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “Now we have to show that we’re going to be greedy enough, tough enough to win a game like that this year. I’m hopeful that our kids will. We talked about [it] right away - it’s just trying to regroup and responding for the remainder of this week.”
Turnovers proved costly for the Crimson, as it allowed 29 total points off of errors in the game. Two fatal turnovers in the last 1:30 allowed UMass to go on an 8-0 run which sealed the defeat for Harvard.
Freshman point guard Siyani Chambers had a banner game in the loss in what was his first collegiate road game. The rookie started and played the entire game, tallying 14 points and seven assists, with just one turnover.
“I thought that was a magnificent performance by Siyani,” Amaker said. “To play the way he played with the spirit and the energy and the toughness, I think he’s shown that he’s going to be an outstanding player. It’s just too bad we couldn’t cap it off with a victory to make it that much sweeter for him.”
Harvard and Manhattan have met eight times previously, splitting the all-time series, 4-4, but have not met since the 1987-88 season.
“We’re trying to grow every day and get to know each other better on the court,” Rivard said. “Obviously we want to win our games but what matters in the end [are] Ivy League games.”

To all the students long tired of the assortment of Ranger cookies, tofu, and chickwiches awaiting them at the end of the line in Annenberg, it might be time for a reality check—or at least one website thinks so. The Daily Meal, a site dedicated to food reviews and recipes, ranked Harvard 12th in its list of the "52 Best Colleges for Food in America."
Citing the 13 dining halls and a menu that includes vegetable jambalaya—whatever that is—The Daily Meal declares that "Harvard is certainly no slouch when it comes to options." Maybe someone should tell them that the food doesn't vary from one dining hall to the next.
The article also claims that "this university makes food fun"—that's a pretty ambiguous statement, but it's good to know that even if the food tastes bad, it can apparently still be fun.
You can't help but wonder what the last 40 colleges on the list have to eat. At least we beat Yale—they came in at number 21.

November 16, 1936: John Harvard Aluminized In Cold Dawn, Cops Save All
In the cold gray dawn one day last week a wandering Yard Cop stopped by the John Harvard statue in front of University Hall. Although the moon was shining brightly, it seemed to him that the Statue was bathed a trifle too much in a white, ethereal, other-wordly light.
And he was right. Earlier in the evening a lusterous cost of aluminum paint had been liberally applied to the fanciful representation of the man who is erroneously labelled as the "founder" of the College.
A quick call for reinforcements brought out the men who apparently are retained just to wait for such an occurance, complete with a gasoline compound known in technical terms as aluminum paint remover. By 8 o'clock the next morning all was dull bronze again save for a suspicious silver daub on one foot, and due to Harvard's well-known aversion to early rising, nobody was the wiser.
November 13, 1953: Replacement of Furniture Program Due to Begin by Next Sebtember 
With elephants leering down from all four walls and with "Peace, Prosperity, and Progress" strewn liberally around the room, the HYRC held its election night jamboree in the Hotel Continental last night.
Hundreds of Ike backers crowded into the Continental to drink the HYRC free beer and to throw out an occasional cheer as the election landslide came in. The discordant sounds of the "King's Men," an instrumental quartet of sorts, mingled with the mumblings and chatterings of the 300-450 present to make the whole affair something less than a spontaneous exhibition of political enthusiasm.
November 15, 1969: Jury Finds 19 Not Guilty In University Hall Appeal
A jury in Middlesex County Superior Court yesterday acquitted 19 persons charged with trespassing during last April's occupation of University Hall.
After the verdict, Justice Robert Sullivan, who presided over the three-day trial, indicated that he would not allow the Commonwealth to continue the prosecution of more than 100 other cases arising from the demonstration.
The 19 persons acquitted-fifteen Harvard students, one M.I.T. graduate student, and three non-students-were among 172 persons arrested for trespass in University Hall April 10 and convicted in Cambridge Third District Court last May.
November 12, 1953: McCarthy Rooters Send CRIME 'Pan Mail' For Cahllenge to Senator on Red Charge
Last July, the Senate of the United States was treated to an exhibition of the letter-writing skill of the supporters of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy Senator Mike Monroney (D. Okia.) had received this mail when he questioned the propriety of McCarthy's investigation of top-secret Central Intelligence Agency, Among other things, Monroney was called a "Red," a "scum bag," a "traitor," a "rat" and a "nozzle-head." Since the CRIMSON'S editorial telling McCarthy to "put up or shut up" on his charge about Communist professors at Harvard was reported nationally and internationally we have been getting some "pan mail" from some of these people. Some of it is reproduced below:
