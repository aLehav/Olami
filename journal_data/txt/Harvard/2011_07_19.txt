After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
President Obama’s decision to pass over Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has reignited speculation that she will enter the 2012 Massachusetts Senate race and challenge incumbent Republican Scott P. Brown for the seat he assumed in 2010.
In an interview Monday with MSNBC, Warren dodged questions about launching a bid for the Senate, saying that her past year in Washington where she worked 14-hour days to get the CFPB off the ground has left her ready to return home and spend time with her family.
“It’s been wonderful work,” she said, “but it has been all-absorbing work…I’m going to take a step away from this.”
But when asked whether she had ruled out running, Warren seemed to imply that she had not closed the door on the possibility.
“Massachusetts does beckon in the sense that it’s my home,” Warren said. “When I get home, I’ll do more thinking then…not from Washington”
While Warren has yet to announce her intentions, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, an influential Democratic activist group, raised over $15,000 for her nascent campaign during about four hours of aggressive fundraising Monday. In addition, the PCCC started a draft petition to get Warren to run.
Besides Brown, there are five confirmed Democratic contenders for the 2012 race, including City Year co-founder Alan A. Khazei ’83 and Newton mayor Setti D. Warren. There are nearly a dozen other rumored candidates, including Martha M. Coakley, who lost to Brown in the 2010 election. Khazei also ran for the seat in 2010 but lost the Democratic primary to Coakley.
While state Democrats are spoiling for a fight in 2012 when Brown is up for re-election, there is a marked lack of excitement about the current contenders. The lack of a popular, well known figure to challenge the man currently occupying the former seat of Edward M. Kennedy '54-'56 has resulted in a less than subtle effort to draft Warren to run.
“The reason we see so many Democrats stepping up is because [Brown] is not representing the people of the Commonwealth,” said Kevin C. Franck, spokesperson for the Massachusetts Democratic Party. “You can’t say you represent the state when you vote 90 percent of time with D.C. Republicans. Regardless of who the nominee is, Scott Brown’s main opponent is his voting record in D.C.”
Many think that even as a moderate conservative, Brown is vulnerable in a state like Massachusetts. But in order for Democrats to unseat an incumbent in an election cycle that is unlikely to be favorable for the party, it is likely that they will have to find—or create—a charismatic contender with name recognition.
And many see Warren as exactly that person.
But if she does decide to run, Warren will face a steep financial hurdle as Brown currently has about $10 million cash on hand for his campaign. Warren is yet to form a campaign committee.
State Democrats are quick to interject, however, that Warren is a candidate that the party could rally around.
“I can say that many Democrats are proud of the work Elizabeth Warren’s done to protect American consumers, and many of those would be thrilled if she decided to take on Scott Brown,” Franck said.
Warren was favored by the left to lead the CFPB, which was drawn up as a response to the financial crisis of 2008. But in recent months, conservatives have mounted a fervent campaign to oppose her candidacy, an effort that made it clear she would not gain confirmation in the Senate.
That realization led the Obama administration to seek another candidate, and the White House announced Monday that former Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray had been tapped as director of the bureau.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Updated July 20, 1:00 a.m. | Gmail will serve as the email interface for most Harvard undergraduate accounts by the middle of next month, replacing the webmail client currently designated for those addresses but used by a fraction of those students.
Students with email addresses that end in “college.harvard.edu” will see the interface switch to Gmail on August 15, the College said on Tuesday. The switch comes following feedback from students asking for changes to the email system, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds said in a statement announcing the switch.
The change will affect most undergraduates, as more than three-quarters of current and incoming students have email addresses with the “college.harvard.edu” domain name. Every class since the Class of 2013 has been assigned to the email service with the “college.harvard.edu” address, which was meant to address problems ranging from limited storage space to a clunky interface associated with the “fas.harvard.edu” email addresses that were assigned to students.
Many members of the Class of 2012 still use the “fas.harvard.edu” email address.
Gmail has assumed the role of the primary email client on campus. Currently, more than four out of five Harvard students use Gmail, Hammonds said.
Even in its earliest months, Gmail attracted a sizable portion of the student body. In 2004 when the service debuted and was invitation-only, an undergraduate told The Crimson, “If anyone doesn’t already have Gmail, they don’t deserve to have it ever.”
Since then, its popularity at the College has soared. In 2007, 38 percent of undergraduates said Gmail was their preferred email provider. By 2008, the percentage had risen to 58.
In the summer of 2008, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Information Technology, the technology group that has since been absorbed into Harvard University Information Technology, began a search for an email vendor for its new “college.harvard.edu” email service, opting for Los Angeles-based company Mail2World over Google.
Harvard Law School uses Mail2World to manage its email services. When it selected its email provider, Google could not meet its requirements for user functionality and administration, according to Pratike Patel, director of enterprise services at the Law School.
Patel said that the Law School will examine feedback the College receives related to Gmail over the next few years.
The College’s announcement comes on the heels of Harvard’s overhaul of its IT services. In June, the University announced the creation of Harvard University Information Technology, which centralized FAS IT and Central Administration IT with the goal of streamlining processes.
“The @college email was clearly identified by students as a pain point, and our goal was to address it quickly and efficiently,” wrote Anne H. Margulies, chief information officer and the lead administrator involved in the IT overhaul, in a statement.
“We’re getting this done incredibly fast—in just four months—and this would not have even been possible without the HUIT transition which allowed us to join our technical staff and form the team needed to get this done," she said.
According to Margulies, a number of other technology-related changes will be announced in the coming weeks. And Harvard’s iSites are already running 50 percent faster, she reports.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Updated July 20, 12:25 p.m. | A former fellow at the Harvard University Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics active in technology communities has been indicted for allegedly hacking into the MIT network and stealing over 4 million academic articles from JSTOR.
 
If convicted, Aaron Swartz, a 24-year-old Cambridge resident who has been charged with wire fraud, computer fraud, unlawfully obtaining information from a protected computer, and recklessly damaging a protected computer, could face up to 35 years in prison and a fine of up to $1 million, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.
 
Swartz allegedly broke into an MIT computer wiring closet between September 24, 2010 and January 6, 2011 to access the MIT network in order to download a large amount of JSTOR articles onto his computers and hard drives, prosecutors said.
 
JSTOR is a not-for-profit organization that archives digitized copies of more than 1,000 academic journals online. Swartz allegedly sought to distribute a large portion of JSTOR’s archive on file-sharing sites, dodging the need to go through MIT and JSTOR’s security efforts.
JSTOR said in a statement that in the fall and winter, more than 4 million articles, book reviews, and other forms of content were downloaded from JSTOR through MIT's network.
"The content taken was systematically downloaded using an approach designed to avoid detection by our monitoring systems," JSTOR said.
JSTOR said it was able to secure the content that was allegedly stolen.
Swartz briefly served a stint as a fellow at the Center for Ethics this past academic year, an employee of the center said.
A University spokesperson said in a statement that Swartz had a 10-month fellowship. After Harvard was told about the investigation, he was placed on leave.
His fellowship ended last month, the spokesperson said.
Swartz has been been active in political and technology-related circles. He founded the start-up Infogami, which was acquired by Reddit, a popular site that aggregates websites. He also helped design the standards that underlie Creative Commons and RSS technology.
 
He is also the director of Demand Progress and a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, two liberal political groups.
In a statement, David Segal, the executive director of Demand Progress, characterized the situation as putting "someone in jail for allegedly checking too many books out of the library."
“Aaron’s career has focused on serving the public interest by promoting ethics, open government, and democratic politics,” he said. “We hope to soon see him cleared of these bizarre charges.”
But in the press release announcing the indictment, U.S. Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz stressed the severity of the allegations.
“Stealing is stealing whether you use acomputer command or a crowbar, and whether you take documents, data, or dollars," Ortiz said. "It is equally harmful to the victim whether you sell what you have stolen or give it away.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification.
CLARIFICATION: July 20, 2011
An earlier version of this July 19 article said in the headline and article that Aaron Swartz co-founded Reddit. Swartz says on his website that he co-founded Reddit. However, in an email, co-founder Alexis Ohanian said that Swartz was not a co-founder of the popular website. In its early months, Reddit acquired Swartz's company Infogami, Ohanian said in a Google Plus post. Tweets from The Crimson circulating this article have also referred to Swartz as a "Reddit co-founder."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Psychology  Professor Marc D. Hauser will resign his tenured position at the University, ending a career at Harvard that began with promise but was marred by a research misconduct investigation.
The announcement of his resignation, effective Aug. 1, comes on the heels of a Psychology Department vote in  February to prohibit him from teaching in the upcoming academic year. It is unclear whether Hauser, a prolific if controversial scholar, faced pressure from the University to resign.
“While  on leave over the past year, I have begun doing some extremely  interesting and rewarding work focusing on the educational needs of  at-risk teenagers. I have also been offered some exciting opportunities  in the private sector,” Hauser wrote in a resignation letter dated July 7. 
Hauser, who  was beloved by students, wrote that he was, as of  now, unsure whether he might return to teaching in the future. 
Last August, facing media scrutiny, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith confirmed an internal investigation had found Hauser “solely responsible for eight counts of scientific misconduct.”
The investigation found instances of misconduct in three of Hauser’s published articles, leading to the retraction of one and the correction of two others to edit or remove unsupported findings, Smith said. In five other instances, the studies called into question either remained unpublished or were corrected before publication.
Harvard remained silent on the details of the investigation and speculation abounded as to the exact nature of the “scientific misconduct”—a charge Harvard defines as fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism. Hauser took a leave of absence for the 2010-2011 academic year and retreated to his home on Cape Cod to work on his new book.
A report earlier this year seemed to validate some of his research after an experiment validated one of the papers that was subject to scrutiny when Hauser's methods began to be questioned.
But scientists are split over whether these results vindicate the professor, with some arguing that the replications do not prove a proper conduct in the original study. Others also point to a potential conflict of interest in the fact that it was Hauser who replicated the experiments in question.
“Ultimately it’s not a question of whether he can replicate his findings—it’s whether other people can,” said Gordon G. Gallup Jr., a psychology professor at University at Albany, State University of New York, in an interview with The Crimson in May.
Still, Hauser's reputation has been enormously damaged by the episode. Prior to the revelations, Hauser was one of the most respected and prolific scholars in the field.
He was also a celebrated teacher and often received high praise from his students. His courses consistently racked up top scores in the Q Guide, the course rating system.
It is believed that a federal investigation is being carried out to determine whether any federal grants were misused, but representatives of that department, the Office of Research Integrity, have in the past declined to confirm the existence of an investigation, citing privacy concerns.
In accordance with federal policy, Harvard turned over the internal investigation’s findings to the ORI last year.
In an interview in May, Psychology Professor Susan E. Carey ’64 said that the report could take even up to seven years to publish.
At the time, Carey said that Harvard would wait for the ORI report’s conclusions to become public before deciding whether pursuing more forceful punitive measures against Hauser, like his dismissal. Hauser's resignation preempts that internal review.
During the University's history, outright dismissals of tenured professors have been exceedingly rare, though many professors have been encouraged to resign over the years. Only the Harvard Corporation, the University's highest governing body, has the authority to initiate dismissal proceedings of a tenured member of the faculty, and in Hauser's case it is clear that such a path was never pursued.
Less clear, however, are the exact circumstances surrounding Hauser's resignation and whether he resigned to pursue other opportunities or whether University administrators made clear he was no longer welcome at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, a research and teaching hospital affiliated with Harvard Medical School, said Monday that a recent breach in security may have released more than 2,000 medical records of radiology patients.
The computer had recently undergone maintenance work, and the service vendor failed to restore the existing security controls following the procedure. According to Beth Israel spokesperson Jerry Berger, intrusion detection software picked up unusual activity, which turned out to be a virus sending out encrypted patient information to an unknown location.
The affected computer, which was stored in a locked room, contained patients’ gender, date of birth, medical record numbers, and details about their radiology procedures.
“Because federal law requires disclosures where dates of birth are involved, we opted to make this disclosure in an abundance of caution,” Berger said.
Immediately upon discovering the virus, the hospital shut down the computer, cleaned its system, and re-installed the affected software. They also set up updated security controls in order to prevent future virus attacks.
“BIDMC takes this incident and the protection of protected health and personal information extremely seriously,” Beth Israel Chief Information Officer John D. Halamka said in a statement. “We are grateful no Social Security numbers or financial information was released and apologize for the inconvenience and deeply regret any concern this situation may cause.”
The hospital is currently in the process of sending out letters to all affected patients and will provide them with free identity theft protection services for one year.

Harvard University Information Technology announced today that all “college.harvard.edu” email accounts will change to a Gmail interface on August 15. This change affects more than 75 percent of the student body, as every student since the Class of 2013 has an @college account.
But what about the seniors who still use @fas accounts?
For the time being, only undergraduates who already have an @college email address are eligible for the new Gmail-based service. HUIT will let students without @college accounts know when they, too, can switch to the latest service.
Here's what HUIT said in an email to students with @fas accounts:
As a student who does not yet have an @College account, you will have an opportunity to obtain one beginning in mid-September.  You are under no obligation to open an @College account.  However, if you choose to do so, HUIT will provide self-service tools and support to migrate your existing @FAS email to your new account.
