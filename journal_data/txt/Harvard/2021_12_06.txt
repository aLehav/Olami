After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Almost every form I fill out has a race question. Usually the options are: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White. While for many this is a mindless act of simply checking one’s box, for me, this question provokes an identity crisis. For as long as I can remember, I have been forced to check the white box because people of Middle Eastern/North African origin are considered part of the white race.
I have always felt comfortable identifying with many different groups. I am Syrian, Lebanese, American, Middle Eastern, and Muslim. While admittedly I appear white, I have never felt white. Growing up in a post-9/11 era, I was always aware that I was different. I was called a terrorist in middle school, watched my mother experience Islamophobia for wearing the hijab, and always worried about family members being stopped for “random security checks” in airports. U.S. intervention in our countries othered us and painted us as the enemy all the while we worried about the impact of war on our families abroad. My experience is in no way rare and there is no doubt that my pale complexion allows me to experience less hardships than Arabs who have darker skin tones or wear the hijab. However, they too are classified as white. Labeling us as white actively erases our experiences as Arab Americans. From 2015 to 2018, the yearly number of anti-Arab hate crimes more than doubled from 37 to 82. Despite the discrimination we faced and continue to face, we are not entitled access to remedies for our mistreatment because we are not recognized as our own group under federal law. We are white by law, but do not enjoy the social privileges of whiteness.
It is important to acknowledge that Arabs were not always considered white in this country. We “became” white. Early Syrian immigrants to the United States mobilized and demanded to be recognized as white because it made them eligible for citizenship. In 1914, a Syrian, George Dow, was rejected by South Carolina’s District Court on the ground that Syrians were “asiatics” and not white, thus not eligible for citizenship. One of Dow’s appeals relied on the claim that he came from the land of Jesus Christ. Thus, a court ruling against Dow would have implied that Jesus Christ was not white. Examining the context and complexities of Dow’s successful appeal leaves us with conclusions about how America’s racist fear of a non-white Jesus helped grant Arabs the status of whiteness.
The race box that one checks matters, and has always mattered. Dow cared that he be white because he wanted the benefits of citizenship. Today, our recognition as a minority in this country is essential to our access to resources. For decades, people have been advocating for the addition of a Middle East and North Africa category to the U.S. Census. While there is an option to select white and then fill in “Egyptian” or “Lebanese,” for example, this leads to undercounting which impacts access to collectivized data on Arabs in the U.S. This ultimately affects information on what kinds of resources our communities need such as federal funding, language assistance, and health research. Despite the fact that researchers at the Bureau released a report concluding that "it is optimal to use a dedicated ‘Middle Eastern or North African’ response category" on the 2020 Census questionnaires, the category was still actively excluded. The lack of MENA’s recognition also has implications that go beyond federal resources. Many scholarships with the mission of supporting minority students, such as the Gates Scholarship, are not open to MENA students because we are considered white.
The Obama administration was open to a MENA category, but the Trump administration was not. According to Samer Khalaf, the national president of American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, the Trump Administration’s exclusion of MENA was a politicized act driven by fear that taking Arabs out of the white category would result in a white minority in this country. It is time our identity is no longer used as a tool to uphold white supremacy and racism. In his campaign, Joe Biden voiced his support for a MENA category, but the question remains if he will follow through.
Despite the exclusion of MENA on the 2020 Census, the conversation and activism surrounding its importance have resulted in more inclusion in other forms I’ve taken. Last year at Harvard, I would check “other” on my Color form for Covid-19 testing, but this year there are Middle Eastern and North African options. While this is a step in the right direction, Harvard has yet to include MENA on its own applications which results in a lack of access to demographic data collection on Harvard’s MENA students.
Speaking up has helped us become seen. We must continue to push for the recognition of our unique culture and experiences in this school and in this country. The addition of a MENA category is essential to my community and is only the beginning of a long road to meeting our needs and shaping a better future where we are no longer labeled in a way that disserves us. MENA students are minority students and our experience in this country can no longer be ignored. We refuse to be whitewashed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Oh, Generation Z! You are my favorite of generations — and not just because I’m one of you. Gen Z will punch a racist in the face, yell at their university administration, and then shudder with anxiety while waiting in line to order coffee. We are so chaotic in our compassion, so resolute and capricious at the same time — truly a generation of young people trying their best to solidify burgeoning paths in a messy world.
An astrologer would say this mishmash of good intentions is because all of Gen Z shares a Neptune placement. Not just astrologers, but also anyone who’s ever had to learn the order of planets in elementary school, know that Neptune is one of the outer planets, billions of miles detached from the Sun’s warmth. As the eighth planet, Neptune orbits the Sun very slowly, only making a full rotation every 165 years. Across a generation of Earthlings born in adjacent (Earth) years, Neptune doesn’t move all that much. Generation Z is defined by birth years from 1997 to 2012. For nearly the exact same set of years, from 1998 to 2021, Neptune was in Aquarius.
Neptune rules the dreams, spirituality, and insights of a generation. It’s the third eye, the cultural zeitgeist, the energy that thrums underneath this eclectic herd of people tied together by time of birth. Aquarius is the visionary of the zodiac: eccentric, idealistic, and intellectual. Gen Z’s Neptune in Aquarius brings to mind all-inclusive humanitarianism and righteous indignation at existing evils — social activists in the fight for something greater than just one.
Harvard students, in many ways, embody the Gen Z, Aquarius Neptune mindset. We are the sweetest of friends, despite — or maybe because of — our history of friendship fumbles. Ask anyone at this school and they’ll tell you that the people are what make this campus home away from home. We eat all our meals together and study for classes together and stay up late talking about nothing together. We feel an immediate kindred affection with others bearing the crimson H, whether against Yale or on Housing Day.
We never shy away from our ideals, either. We get so invested in our arguments about modern First Amendment legal doctrine in section that we struggle to phrase our passion in words. We publish 650-850 word op-eds about the issues we really care about, that it seems no one else is talking about. We protest often and with fervor. We believe that Harvard can do better, that the world can do better, that we can do better. We are agents of positive change, or at least trying our best to enact it.
We do this all out of love. Aquarius to me has always been motivated by love in its purest, most abstract, intellectualized shape — what Plato would call the singular Form of Love. It’s love as a broad idea, that extends to people we haven’t even met and issues we aren’t yet familiar with, that we then apply to the specific people and situations we encounter in our lives. It’s part of why I love Gen Z so much: We love so fiercely, with no prior conditions.
With all the love our generation bestows upon others, we should love ourselves just as strongly. As Harvard students, we are prone to pinching and prodding at the parts of us we want to fix, berating ourselves for how we are perceived outside of our control, and blaming ourselves for multi-person problems. Please treat yourself with the same kindness and benefit of doubt that you afford others. You deserve it. Just like everyone else in the world, you are a human being; love is inherently your birthright.
When I started this column several months ago, I asked you to run away into the stars with me. I hope you have marveled at what you found alongside me. I hope you have fallen in love with yourself through astrology’s external view of yourself. I hope you will continue to love and cherish yourself.
I don’t know you, but I love you — because I’m part of Gen Z and I love everyone because the stars aligned just so at your birth to create the unique, beautiful person you are, because you are not the universe’s mistake but its greatest masterpiece. This is how I hope you love yourself as well: unconditionally.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It's official: Harvard graduate students have a new contract with the University. After protracted, strike-ridden negotiations, members of Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers ratified a new, four-year-long contract with the University with 70.6 percent of voters in support.
We extend our unequivocal support to the union and its members for the ratification of the contract. Their fight for basic improvements to their working conditions has been inspiring and energizing, helping revitalize and strengthen our campus’ labor culture. We are beyond glad that some of HGSW-UAW's key aims, chiefly substantial and retroactive pay rises above Boston's inflation level, are reflected in the agreement.
Our support is not, however, blind to the obvious: The new agreement is substantially less popular than its predecessor. Almost three in every ten union members didn’t support the motion to ratify, a roughly ten-fold increase in opposition compared to the union's last ratification vote in 2020. A minoritarian but significant portion of union members had enough misgivings to vote against substantial raises and in favor of a second strike. The question, then, is why internal opposition increased so substantially, and whether the concerns it raised are justified.
We sympathize with the minority's unease. The compromise agreement — despite its many virtues and the broad support it enjoys — risks hurting both the union and some of its long-held goals.
The latter point is almost self-evident: To secure certain University concessions, the union was forced to walk back on key, deeply cherished issues. The agreement lacks, for example, any substantial improvements on the third party arbitration front, offering only legal funding for student workers going through the University’s Title IX process. The creation of independent channels to arbitrate discrimination and harassment cases remains an extremely reasonable, regrettably unfulfilled demand. Our official policies shouldn't stand unchanged in the face of repeated examples of the dysfunction that plagues university reporting systems — and yet it seems almost certain that they will, at least for the next four years.
But HGSU-UAW's second concession might prove even more painful in the long run. The contract lacks any provisions instituting “agency shop,” a mechanism that would require all student workers to contribute financially to union activities or a student worker health fee. Forcing workers to pay a fee or contribute to a union will always inspire controversy, even when frequently cited concerns about the union's political activity are absent as they are at HGSU-UAW. A union, however, is only as powerful as its funding ability, particularly when it faces an employer as institutionally powerful and wealthy as Harvard. Without some sort of agency shop provisions, employees have less of an incentive to join the union and pay fees. Some student-workers sought to warn of the financial risk before the vote, circulating an open letter arguing that without agency shop, the union could become financially unsustainable. Their warnings unheard, HGSU-UAW will have to survive without any form of agency shop funding safety net for the next four years.
In fact, the contract's duration, those infamous four years during which progress on any conceded issue will remain stalled, might be its single greatest weakness. The long agreement does offer more future financial security for graduate students, guaranteeing consistent, predictable raises. It does so, however, at the cost of guaranteeing that the union won't mobilize its membership en masse for a period long enough to see many of the union's current leadership graduate their programs. The union is bound to lose intangible capital — accumulated knowledge of how to best wrestle against University negotiators, acquired skills perfected over the past two strikes and third strike threat, awareness of and support for among the student body — in the absence of further negotiations.
We are glad that HGSU-UAW managed to secure substantial pay increases, and that its membership felt satisfied enough to support a new contract and prevent a second strike. Union members must now fight to ensure the agreement isn't a death kiss, to continue spreading awareness of union activity and key issues like third party arbitration without the mobilizing force of contract negotiations, and fundraising without agency shop provisions. If they fail to do so — if monetary improvements pave the way to complacency, or if time erodes the union's knowledge base — the union might emerge from its years-long slumber substantially weaker than before. That would be deeply regrettable, for workers and labor-oriented community members alike.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Brigham and Women’s Hospital researchers will begin treating patients this week as part of a first-of-its-kind human trial for a nasal vaccine to prevent and slow Alzheimer’s disease progression.
The trial is the culmination of 20 years of preclinical research led by Howard L. Weiner, a Harvard Medical School professor of neurology and co-director of the Brigham’s Center for Neurologic Diseases, per a Nov. 16 press release.
The clinical trial involves 16 participants between the ages of 60 and 85 experiencing early, symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease. Over a five- to six-week period, each participant will receive a total of four doses of the nasal vaccine, according to Tanuja Chitnis, an HMS professor of neurology and the trial’s principal investigator.
The first phase of the trial focuses on assessing the safety and tolerability of the vaccine among its participants. The research group anticipates having results by next summer, Chitnis said.
Administered intranasally, the vaccine utilizes Protollin, a drug that stimulates the immune system by activating white blood cells. Protollin clears the brain of clumps of protein pieces called beta-amyloid, which are associated with Alzheimer’s disease.
“It’s working to activate macrophages and microglia — which are normal cells that phagocytose — and help to clear abnormal proteins or materials and we’re activating those cells to clear amyloid-beta from the brains of Alzheimer’s patients,” Chitnis said.
Weiner said that this nasal vaccine is a “totally unique approach” compared with other treatments for Alzheimer’s disease currently in development, such as drugs that intravenously give antibodies or work to prevent clumping by inhibiting the breakdown of amyloid protein.
He added that the nasal vaccine does not appear to have any major clinical side effects.
When used in tandem with available screening methods, the vaccine may help those at high risk for developing Alzheimer’s, according to Weiner.
“You measure people for high blood pressure, and if you treat them, they have less heart attacks and strokes,” Weiner said. “There’s now biomarkers and blood tests that you can do where people who are at risk for Alzheimer’s, and you could treat them with this vaccine and you could prevent them from getting Alzheimer’s.”
Weiner also said that if this clinical trial is met with success, he believes doctors will be able to prescribe it to individuals within the next five or six years.
“It could be really something that’s used widely in the population and all over the world to help slow down or prevent Alzheimer’s,” he said. “It really has the potential to be a major vaccine.”
Chitnis said she believes that this vaccine, following further development and research, may have the potential for preventing and treating other neurodegenerative diseases.
“What we are seeing are a number of neurodegenerative diseases that are due to misfolded proteins, which likely are not being eliminated correctly by the body and especially in the brain,” Chitnis said.
“I think it will be interesting to see if a similar approach could be utilized in diseases like Parkinson’s, ALS, and other tauopathies,” she added.

The Omicron variant — a new strain of Covid-19 — was first discovered by researchers at the Botswana-Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership on Nov. 19.
The Botswana-Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership was founded in 1996, and aims to promote collaborative research between the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the Botswana’s Ministry of Health and Wellness, along with the training of health care professionals.
Sikhulile Moyo, the laboratory director for the lab in Gaborone, Botswana and the first scientist to discover the Omicron variant, said in a Dec. 3 press conference that the hypothesis around where the variant originated is “not very clear.”
“We are still trying to understand how so many mutations arose for Omicron in such a short period of time,” he said.
Roger L. Shapiro, a professor at the School of Public Health and chair of the board of directors of the Botswana-Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership, said during the press conference that the lab’s discovery of the Omicron variant was “not accidental.” He credited it to the lab’s partnership with the Botswana government and the country’s Covid-19 task force.
“Dr. Moyo has worked to continuously sequence the SARS-CoV-2 viruses that have been identified by our laboratory,” Shapiro said. “His team at [the Botswana-Harvard Partnership] has sequenced over 2,300 viruses, and is currently working to do many more.”
Four days after they uploaded a genomic sequence of the variant to the GISAID public database, other countries such as South Africa quickly identified the same mutations.
Moyo said though South Africa and Hong Kong also “detected” the mutated sequence, Botswana was the first to “deposit” it.
Simani Gaseitsiwe, the deputy laboratory director at the Botswana-Harvard Partnership, said in an interview that the lab aims to answer more questions about the “severity” of the virus and whether antibodies from patients with the Omicron variant are able to “neutralize the previous variant.”
“We’re trying to plan to start a cohort that would now follow up some of the patients who are infected with the variants,” he said. “There is a lot of interest to figure out exactly what is the impact of this highly mutated virus.”
Three days after the lab uploaded the sequence to the database, informing other countries about the discovery of a new variant, the United States instituted a travel ban to eight countries, including Botswana and South Africa.
Shahin Lockman, an associate professor at the School of Public Health and a clinical researcher at the Botswana-Harvard Partnership, said she worries that the travel bans imposed by Western countries are “counterproductive” and will disincentivize lower-income countries like Botswana from sequencing viral genomes to detect mutations in the virus.
“I trust that these scientists who were transparent this time would be transparent again next time, but that’s not always going to be true,” Lockman said. “There is only disincentive to share information if this is the consequence.”
Gaseitsiwe said the ban “seems a bit excessive.”
“Responses like these, they almost seem to make countries to be independent, isolated entities,” he said. “That decision will obviously have some negative impact.”
Lockman highlighted the importance of transparency in variant reporting and identification from scientists around the world.
“As a global community, it behooves us to support science and scientists in a sustainable and collaborative way in Africa and throughout the globe,” she said. “It’s kind of a win-win for everybody, and I’m very proud of our colleagues in Botswana.”

The Cambridge City Council is seeking a rodent control liaison to spearhead a response to the rising rodent population in the city.
At a Sept. 13 meeting, the council unanimously passed a policy order outlining a report on rodent control efforts since last February and establishing a liaison position.
The future liaison will “serve as the point of contact for rat and rodent complaints and information” for both the public and the City Council, per the September policy order.
The liaison will not be working alone. The City Manager’s office and Public Health, Inspectional Services, and Public Works departments hold regular Rodent Task Force meetings to discuss the ongoing problem, according to the report transmitted from City Manager Louis A. DePasquale’s office to the council. Currently, Dan Riviello, Cambridge’s Community Relations Manager, oversees the task force meetings and coordination of the city’s response to the rodent problem.
“The City has been committed to confronting the problem of rodents in a variety of ways — by addressing issues on public property, helping residents take issues on private property, working to control rodents during construction projects, enforcing sanitary codes and ordinances, and educating the public,” DePasquale wrote in a Nov. 22 communication to the council.
Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon attributed the high rat population to the Covid-19 pandemic and ongoing construction in the area.
“I think right before Covid, it was becoming a serious issue, and for some reason, Covid really seemed to exacerbate the problem,” Mallon said in an interview. “There’s a lot of construction projects that are going on in the city and that always sort of stimulates the rat and rodent activity that you tend to see.”
The city has also established a rodent control program that will provide private property owners with a free rodent inspection, which owners can apply for online. The city’s Inspectional Services staff and a pest control contractor will assess the property’s rodent activity, then give feedback on how to prevent further rodent activity.
Mallon discussed other strategies the city is using to combat the rodent problem in Cambridge, such as “rat-proof” trash cans with thicker plastic and compost programs.
“We started a curbside compost program, which actually really helps to decrease the amount of food that rats have access to in the trash cans,” Mallon said. “We will be rolling out special trash cans for each and every resident that will be rat-proof.”
Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan acknowledged the challenges some Cambridge residents have experienced with rodent-related communication to the city. He said that an official rat liaison would help bridge the gap between Cantabrigians and the city.
“In some cases, it is true that people have some difficulty with interacting with the city because they don’t always know who to call or who they should talk to, and so it can be helpful to have one person that is in charge of that problem,” he said.
Zondervan also noted it is important for Cantabrigians to “do their part” to help alleviate the city rodent problem. Similarly, Mallon called for collaboration among neighbors to decrease the rodent population.
“I can’t solve the rodent problem on my part of the street without getting my neighbors involved,” Mallon said.

Michael Y. Cheng ’22 and Emmett E. de Kanter ’24 were inaugurated as president and vice president of the Undergraduate Council Sunday during an acrimonious meeting that was derailed by accusations of bullying and intimidation leveled at the new president.
The meeting — which consisted of lengthy speeches by outgoing committee chairs, an inauguration ceremony, an incomplete election for new executives, and voting on legislation — dragged on for upward of three hours. Roughly half of the body’s members left the meeting before it concluded, and the UC had to schedule an emergency meeting to get through remaining action items.
Early in the meeting, Oak Yard Representative Laila A. Nasher ’25 accused Cheng of exploiting her identity as a first-generation, low-income student to consolidate power.
Nasher said Cheng previously asked her to meet on proposals for his cabinet, which she applied to be part of, but the meeting went much longer than expected as it turned into a discussion of their "shared frustrations as FGLI students.” She alleged Cheng’s actual intention for calling the meeting was to secure her opposition to a controversial proposed constitutional amendment that the outgoing UC leadership introduced to limit sweeping changes to its constitution.
In his campaign, Cheng promised to rewrite the UC constitution.
Nasher alleged that Cheng said during their conversation that her vote in favor of the proposed amendment disqualified her from working in his cabinet.
“Can you commit that you will not manipulate and harass other students on this council, other students in this school?” Nasher asked Cheng during Sunday’s meeting. “Because I am sick and tired of my identity as an FGLI student, as a woman of color, being used to further political aims.”
Cheng apologized to Nasher during his inaugural speech.
“These allegations are false and I really apologize if my words have given them the appearance that they are true,” Cheng said in his speech. “I really apologize if it seems like I’m trying to harass and intimidate people. That is not my intention and intimidation is never acceptable.”
Cheng also hit a note of unity during his speech.
“We’ve got to change systems big and small. Local system change is still system change and it’s the system change that we’d like to achieve in the coming weeks together,” he said. “We need to get a student government that we deserve, one where we’re not in crazy constitutional fights and mudslinging all the time.”
Dennis W.H. Kwok, a founding member of the Hong Kong Civic Party who was active in the 2019 protests against the Chinese government, also gave a speech at the inauguration.
Following the ceremony, the council proceeded to elect a new secretary and treasurer. After hearing the secretary candidates’ speeches and holding a vote by secret ballot, the council moved to postpone the election after realizing there were not enough voters to certify the election under the constitution’s bylaws.
To conclude the meeting, the council passed two pieces of legislation, which allocated funds to extracurricular groups and clarified language in the advocacy fund program, respectively. Due to time constraints, the UC postponed debate on the other 10 acts on the meeting’s agenda, to be considered during a forthcoming emergency meeting.

Researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health developed a mathematical model to explore the population-level impacts of various SARS-CoV-2 variants and the effects of vaccination in combating them.
The study’s model, described in a paper last month in the journal Cell, worked to understand how different strains of the coronavirus interact at the population level with vaccination and other non-pharmaceutical prevention methods, such as wearing masks.
The team found that variants with some immune system evasion — termed partial immune escape — most often results in a less severe impact or fails to spread widely at all, while enhanced transmissibility in a variant increases infections and limits the time available for vaccination to impact case numbers.
However, the effect of variants is most significant when both of these changes occur simultaneously. The recent Delta variant likely falls into this category, which may help explain its significant impact on the spread of the virus, per the study.
HSPH postdoctoral research fellow Mary E. Bushman, who led the study, told the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication, that the researchers are still unsure how Omicron — the newly dominant strain in South Africa — fits into the study’s framework.
“At the moment, we don’t have the necessary information to distinguish between increased transmissibility, immune escape, and other factors,” Bushman said in a Nov. 29 interview with the Gazette.
Bushman and others are continuing to run simulations to determine the potential impacts of the Omicron variant.
While the different strains of SARS-CoV-2 may impact vaccine efficacy for an individual, that is not necessarily the case at the population level. Despite rising case numbers, the number of infections avoided due to vaccination remains consistent within the population as a whole.
Bushman explained in an email that vaccines are still able to prevent a great number of infections, even if variants with partial immune escape are present.
“That’s partly because we were looking at the total number of infections prevented, including non-variant infections, but it’s also because when a lot of people receive a partially effective vaccine, you still prevent a lot of infections,” Bushman wrote.
A leading hypothesis suggests that variants are the result of chronic SARS-CoV-2 infections that fail to clear the host’s body — a byproduct of increased spread of the virus, according to Bushman.
Bushman wrote the researchers believe vaccination is a top priority to limit chronic Covid-19 infections and the development of future variants.
“Any infection that you prevent by vaccination might be the predecessor to a future variant of concern. In my opinion, though, that’s a secondary justification for equitable access to vaccines. The primary justification is that it’s a moral imperative,” Bushman wrote.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences’s Task Force on Visual Culture and Signage recommended updating portraits in Annenberg Hall and expanding Harvard’s tour program using digital content in a final report issued Monday after more than a year of work.
The 29-page report is the product of research and discussion among faculty and undergraduate students since fall 2020 on creating a more “dynamic, welcoming, and inclusive” visual culture on campus. FAS Dean Claudine Gay commissioned the group as one of Harvard’s steps to “advance racial justice” in the FAS, according to an email she sent to affiliates Monday.
“It was an extraordinary group, extremely dedicated, with active participation on the part of every single member,” Dean of the Arts and Humanities Robin E. Kelsey — who also chaired the task force — said in an interview.
“It was one of the highlights of an otherwise very difficult academic year last year, to meet regularly with this group and to pursue this very important work,” he added.
The report is organized into seven sections that include information on the history of FAS visual culture and signage, recommendations for updating it, and guidelines for doing so. According to Kelsey, “signage” refers to things that help people orient, or “wayfind,” themselves around campus.
“By and large, Harvard has done so much to protect a certain pastoral ideal for the campus that signage has been kept to a minimum,” Kelsey said.
“We don’t want Harvard to be a place where you have to be someone from a particular part of society with a particular background in order to feel comfortable walking around on our campus, and I think we can do much more to make this a campus truly accessible to all of our community members and our visitors as well,” he added.
In that vein, the report recommends expanding Harvard’s tour program using digital content. It suggests a model of providing smartphone access to text, audio and video content on the FAS’s “history, architecture, and important community members.”
“The campus of the FAS is a destination for many visitors and tourists every academic year,” Kelsey said.
“The task force regarded the experience that we give those visitors to be under-curated,” he added. “We could do much more to introduce visitors to the campus to the mission of our school.”
Another of the recommendations put forth by the report is to refresh the visual culture of spaces that are particularly important to campus culture, including the FAS Faculty Room, Annenberg Hall, and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Student Center in Lehman Hall.
It calls for the redecoration of walls of Annenberg, the freshman dining hall, which currently display 23 portraits, of which none include women and all but three depict white men. One portrait, installed in 2010, depicts Caleb Cheeshahteaumuck, the first Native American student to graduate from Harvard in 1665.
The redecoration will be organized by a newly-established FAS Standing Committee on Visual Culture and Signage and a new position of FAS Campus Curator, according to Gay’s email.
“So many undergraduates in particular named Annenberg Hall as a space that very much affects them and their sense of belonging at the institution, that it seemed worthwhile for us to select that as one of the spaces that we would direct our resources and energies to,” Kelsey said.
In addition to refreshing spaces, among the report’s recommendations are a program of public art that aims to support living artists and display art created by students and faculty. The report also calls for Harvard’s campus to be made more accessible to people with disabilities.
The new Standing Committee will be chaired by Dan I. Byers, the director of the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, and will be tasked with overseeing next steps in implementation of the report, according to Gay’s email. Kelsey said the future work in this realm will depend on Harvard’s openness for self-evaluation and adaptation.
“There will be undoubtedly some missteps,” he said. “There will be some moments where we decide to change direction.”
“We want to ensure that we remain nimble enough, and self-critical enough, to revise and constantly update and improve our visual culture,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its final pair of games before the upcoming three-week winter holiday, the No. 9/10 Harvard women’s hockey team pulled out two victories — one in thrilling fashion and one by a comfortable margin.
On Friday, the Crimson (9-3, 6-3 ECAC) used three goals in the first four minutes of play to cruise to victory over Union (2-15-1, 0-9 ECAC). A day later, it returned to Bright-Landry Hockey Center to eke out a 4-3 overtime victory over Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (6-13, 3-7 ECAC).
The Crimson will not play again until Dec. 31, when it will welcomeMinnesota-Duluth as it looks to extend its successful season into the new year. The bulk of Harvard’s conference schedule will begin at Colgate on Jan. 7.
HARVARD 4, RPI 3 (OT)
In the second contest of the weekend, Harvard opened up a three-goal lead before RPI engineered a comeback, tying the game at three goals apiece through 60 minutes of play. The Crimson then made quick work of the Engineers in overtime, scoring the game-winning goal just 19 seconds into the 3-on-3, golden goal extra period. Despite facing a stiff challenge from RPI, Harvard improved to 9-3 with the victory.
Harvard freshman forward Taze Thompson, who had also found the back of the net in Friday’s 5-0 win over Union, continued her momentum on Saturday, scoring just over one minute after the opening puck drop. Thompson gathered a short rebound off of a long shot attempt by senior defender Emma Bucklesand fired it into the wide-open net for her third goal of the season. The Crimson would tack on another goal later in the first period after senior forward Becca Gilmore skated around the back of the cage before finding junior forward Kristin Della Rovere in front of the right post. It was Della Rovere’s fourth goal of the season and Gilmore’s seventh assist — one shy of senior forward Dominique Petrie’s team lead.
Then, in the second period, Harvard went on a two-minute power play when RPI’s Nyah Phillip was called for a boarding penalty. In its second power-play opportunity of the period, the Crimson converted, with senior forward Brooke Jovanovich weaving her way through traffic before first-year forward Paige Lester cleaned it up from just in front of the net. Lester, who hails from Oakville, Ont., netted just the second goal of her career. Entering the game, the Engineers had been stellar on the penalty kill, allowing goals just twice in 55 opportunities prior to this weekend to lead the nation.
“[Power plays] are big momentum shifters in a game. When you’re able to score on one, it really helps shift the momentum and deflate the other team,” Petrie said. “Being able to capitalize on it gave us the confidence and allowed us to settle into the game a little bit more.”
But RPI came roaring back to tie the game at three goals apiece, finally breaking through first-year goalie Alex Pellicci’s stranglehold on the cage. After shutting out Union on Friday, she managed 10 saves while allowing three goals. The first two goals came off rebounds and were scored by graduate student forward Lauren Severson, who found the back of the net for the third and fourth times this season.
“We definitely let them come back into the game,” Petrie said. “Any team we play is going to be tough to play against, and we can’t really give them an inch, and we did that a little bit in the end of the second and the third period, and they clawed their way back. And I think it just goes to show that we can never take our foot off the gas.”
After the third RPI goal, which occurred with just shy of six seconds left in the contest, Harvard managed four more shots on goal in regulation, but Engineers goaltender Amanda Rampado saved them all, sending the outcome of the game to balance on the five-minute, 3-on-3 winner-take-all extra period. The Crimson made quick work after the puck drop, as Petrie won the initial faceoff and Willoughby’s medium-range shot found the right side of the net just 19 seconds into the overtime period.
“We always play a game in practice that’s like, ‘Next goal wins,’ and I remember when we got out on the ice, I said … ‘Next goal wins, let’s make it under 30 [seconds],’ and we actually did that, so that was pretty cool,” Petrie said. “We came out and knew we wanted to attack, and [Petrie, Willoughby, and junior forward Anne Bloomer] have played on OT before and had some good looks, so it was awesome to get out there this time and bury it right away.”
On Saturday, Harvard produced a strong statistical performance. Th Crimson managed 39 shots on goal while allowing only 13, and continued its dominance in the faceoff circle. Harvard entered the weekend as the second-best team in the country on faceoffs behind only Wisconsin — the top-ranked overall team in the nation — and won 38 out of the 54 faceoffs against RPI. Each of the four Crimson goals was scored by a different player, and Petrie led the team with two assists.
HARVARD 5, UNION 0
On Friday, Harvard got off to a hot start, finding the back of the cage on each of its first three shots to open up a 3-0 lead in the first four minutes of the game. The Crimson scored its first goal 44 seconds into the contest, when Gilmore’s entry pass into the middle found Della Rovere in front of the cage. Her backhanded shot was the quickest opening goal that Harvard has scored this season.
Over the next three minutes of game time, Harvard scored two more goals in very similar fashion, with centering passes from the right wing finding goal-scorers directly in front of the cage. Each scorer finished on the left side of the net. First it was senior forward Keely Moy, who found her fellow Californian Petrie for a score. Then, just 92 seconds later, Gilmore finished one herself, this time assisted by Thompson.
“That was an unbelievable start by our team,” Petrie said with a laugh. “Probably couldn’t draw it up any better, [with] three goals on three shots. We just came out hungry. We had some great looks, and we all buried on our opportunities, which was good. And that let us settle into the game a little bit and ... allowed us to play a little bit more relaxed.”
After the Crimson’s fourth goal, a Thompson finish from close range, the game became a battle of goaltenders, as the Dutchwomen replaced their struggling starter, sophomore Olivia Rinzel, with freshman Sophie Matsoukas. Rinzel conceded four goals and made two saves in about 13 minutes of action, but Union’s defense became stellar after Matsoukas took over. The first-year managed to stop 32 Harvard shots while allowing just one to find the back of the net.
For the Crimson, 27th year head coach Katey Stone relied on Pellicci, who made the second start of her career — the first coming in a 5-2 win over Brown on Nov. 13. The Prior Lake, Minn., native made stellar save after stellar save, outdueling Matsoukas en route to a 22-save shutout, Harvard’s second clean sheet of the season. Pellicci was the third goalie to see action for the Crimson this season after senior Becky Dutton made five starts and junior Lindsay Reed made two.
“That was unbelievable,” Petrie said. “She’s a great goaltender, very calm back there, and allows our team to play with a lot of confidence when she’s in the net. She’s just very steady and it was awesome for us to help her out and get that first career shutout.”
Pellicci’s brilliance helped Harvard to a dominant victory, scoring numerous significant statistical wins in addition to the scoreline. The Crimson managed to win 31 out of its 46 puck drops, increasing its overall average. Meanwhile, the prolific offense managed to fire 70 shots, 39 of which were on target. Union got off 42 shots, but only 22 were on target. The 39 shots on goal is tied for the fourth-most that Harvard has recorded so far this season.
The win represented an all-around team effort for the Crimson, as the five goals were scored by five different players, and seven different players registered an assist.
Before Harvard faces Minnesota-Duluth on New Year’s Eve, it will look to clean up its discipline, as the Bulldogs carry the nation’s second-best power play. Against the Dutchwomen, the Crimson committed four minor penalties in the second period alone and five overall.
“I think we [have] to stay a little bit more disciplined,” Petrie said. “Special teams do play a big factor in it, but the more disciplined we are and the more we can stay out of the box, I think it’s a lot easier when you’re playing five-on-five than down a woman.”
After the winter break, Harvard will return to face a few strong teams within the conference, starting with a road trip to Colgate on Jan. 7. The Raiders (15-4-1, 5-2-1ECAC) handed the Crimson a 5-4 loss in overtime on Oct. 30. With a strong return from break, the Crimson seemingly stands a chance to return to the NCAA Women’s Ice Hockey tournament for the first time since 2015. If Harvard does, it will hope to do one better than it did in that year, when that 27-6-3 team fell to Minnesota in the national championship, marking the fourth runner-up finish in school history. Harvard has not won an ice hockey national championship since the NCAA tournament’s founding in 2001, winning the only national championship in program history in 1999.

If Starbucks had to be sacrificed, it better be good. While HSA may be taking over the location with The Harvard Shop, it still left us wondering... what could be a cool new addition to the collection of stores & restaurants in the Square? Never fear — Flyby has you covered with a list of options that students ~actually~ want to see in the Square.
An 18+ Club — It’s Time. 
No more catching the train to Boston or MIT, have all your fun in the Square. Yes, that’s right, you’ll only have to wobble in your heels across the Yard.
Apple Store
You cracked your iPhone? You realize you actually do ~need~ that iPad to do your PSETs? You lost your Apple pen? Seeing how I found three pens just yesterday at Cabot, an Apple store is a must to bring to Harvard. While you’re there, buy some noise cancelling Airpods if you’re feeling unprepared for one of Harvard’s three traditions: the primal scream — coming to you this Wednesday! Mark your calendars ;)
Competition For That Pricey Pharmacy
Since when did we resort to a pharmacy for our groceries? They don’t even sell brown sugar. They sell milk for $5. They have a monopoly (no, I did not take Ec10a: Introduction to Microeconomics) on our groceries. So… it’s time to introduce some competition. Costco? H Mart? Walmart? TARGET >>>. Heck, I’d settle for Trader Joe’s.
Grab & Go Breakfast
Just one shop that opens at 5 a.m., please. It’s almost finals season and I need to be able to satisfy my early morning (or all nighter mid study break) cravings. I don’t want to wait until 7:30 a.m. for my yogurt, and I also don’t want to miss another breakfast because I slept in. It’s time to have a grab & go in the Square filled with pastries, warm breakfast and fruit other than melons — pre-packaged and affordable.
Cute Bookstore Cafes for Your Upcoming Meet Cute 
Can there ever be enough places to study and grab coffee? For cute Instagrammable photos? For the beginning of a real life cute rom-com? The answer is no, especially when there are unique cafe ideas from around the world to steal borrow ideas from. Cafes with sticky notes covering the walls with supportive messages, cafes covered in pink, cafes with puppies to pet or cafes inspired by comics — the options are endless. Add in a bookstore and the ambience is even more perfect.
Special Mention: Border Cafe
Class of 2025 and 2024, it’s okay to be confused. I am too. But according to alumni and upperclassmen, Border Cafe used to sit on Church Street. From winning Flyby’s guac competition to being a hub for social events, it is clear that Border held a special place in everyone’s heart. Unfortunately, it closed its doors after 34 years in the Square when a two alarm fire broke out — leaving future generations of Harvard students to never experience the iconic experience of eating at Border. No, Harvard did not ~buy~ out Border Cafe, but it needs to bring it back asap.
Not Another Merch Store
Was the Coop, the Harvard Shop, and the dozen other Harvard Shirt Stores not enough? Even H&M is selling Harvard merchandise. It’s time for the merch stores and the Square to take a break. My wallet simply cannot handle it.
While the shock of Starbucks closing hasn’t completely worn off, it’s time to forgive HSA for their (crime) completely (not) okay shutting down of our (favorite) coffee shop. The convenience of Starbucks being located next to the Smith Campus Center and the Yard will be ~missed~ but I suppose it’s time to try ~something new~. Anyone want to go get Peet’s?
