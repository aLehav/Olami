In the Loeb Experimental Theater, five women of color sit at a large table surrounded by floral-print sofas, racks of pastel-hued dresses, and walls painted an orangey-pink color lovingly referred to as “Guava Jelly.” They are the all-female student cast of “Real Women Have Curves,” a comedy that deals with issues of immigration, body image, and female worth, opening March 8.
Set in a tiny home-turned-sewing-factory in East Los Angeles, the play follows five Latina immigrant women over the course of five days in 1987 as they share their stories and try to keep up with an impossibly demanding production schedule. The play, which premiered in 1990, was inspired by playwright Josefina López’s own experience as a Latina immigrant working in a Los Angeles garment factory before she attended Columbia College in Chicago. López’s point of view is vocalized through the lead character Ana, a recent high school graduate unhappily working at her sister’s factory while waiting for her college financial aid decision.
For members of the all-female, majority-Latina cast, putting on this play is like coming home.
“A lot of us have lived those experiences or know people that have, which I think makes it very real in a way that sometimes shows aren’t,” Ariana O. Soto ’20 said. Like her character, Ana, Soto is Mexican-American and grew up in Los Angeles.
Noelle V. Castro ’22 plays Estela, the owner of the makeshift factory who, without legal citizenship status, lives in constant fear of deportation. In her first-ever acting role, Castro brings a piece of her own identity to the character. “In her, I see my mom because my mother is an immigrant,” Castro said. “So whenever I think of Estela, what she goes through, and how she’s so motivated to fix her current situation, I think of my mom. Being in this character is so special and the fact that I have the ability to tell her story is just so beautiful.”
Given the current surge in female empowerment activism, director Bianca I. Rodriguez ’20 said that now is the “perfect timing” for “Real Women Have Curves” to take the stage. “I really want people to see that nothing’s changed, no matter how people feel that it has,” Rodriguez said. “The issues that women feel today are things that they felt in 1987.”
Rodriguez explains that although the play addresses relevant social and political issues, everyone can connect to these characters. In an effort to place spectators within the world of the play, Rodriguez opted for an immersive audience experience with seating throughout the stage space.
“You feel like you’re there. You feel like you’re in the room,” Soto said. “It brings people into the story in a way that would be different if they were just sitting in risers.”
Rodriguez said that she hopes the audience will come away with a deeply empathetic understanding of these characters and the Latinx experience at large. “I really wanted Latinx writers and characters to be portrayed as they are, in all their humanity, in a true representation of what Latinidad is,” Rodriguez said. “You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, and you’ll be on this journey with them, together.”
“Real Women Have Curves” will run March 8 through 15 in the Loeb Ex.

Do science and comedy go together? Comedian Shane Mauss seems to think so, as did the crowd who packed the house to see Mauss’s touring comedy show “Stand Up Science” at the Laugh Boston comedy club on Feb. 27. Over the course of 90 minutes, host Shane Mauss and local comedian Ken Reid, along with local scientists Dan Everett and Harvard’s own psychology professor Steven Pinker, offered a performance that proved to be equal parts stand-up and Ted talk.
Mauss took the stage first and launched into the first stand-up routine of the night. He told stories related to his own divergent interests — comedy and science — and about how they came together to form the basis of the show. Though he has been a stand-up comedian for over fifteen years, Mauss stated that he is an avid fan of scientific inquiry. When he began emailing academics and scientists in diverse fields, he was surprised to find that they often responded to his emails. Based partially on those responses, Mauss eventually created and hosted a science podcast entitled “Here We Are.” Though he seemed to poke fun at science and scientists, it is clear that Mauss has a profound respect for the discipline.
Based on his own struggles reading academic articles, Mauss said that he is amazed that academics don’t “read a paragraph, take a nap … You’d think your brain would care about learning about itself.”
Taking a more serious tone, Mauss went on to say that the inspiration for his show came from a desire to give scientists the attention that he feels is unjustly reserved for celebrities.
“I wish scientists were our celebrities,” Mauss said.
Following Mauss’s set, the tone of the show shifted significantly as scientist Dan Everett took the stage. Though he now serves as the Dean of Arts and Sciences at Bentley University, Everett’s past work was much more research oriented: He spent thirty years studying hunter-gatherer tribes and anthropological linguistics. His talk centered around his current research on Homo Erectus and the development of human language. He discussed the presence and development of their language, their settlements, and their migration and proliferation across the globe.
Ken Reid, a local comedian, cinephile, and host of the podcast “TV Guidance Counselor,” brought the comedy back in with the second stand-up routine of the evening. Departing from the science theme, Reid’s comedy focused on the humorous aspects of his day-to-day life.
To round out the performances of the evening, Harvard’s Steven Pinker, a psychology professor who conducts research on language and cognition, took the stage. Pinker gave his presentation on the difference between common knowledge and shared knowledge. As he described it, shared knowledge is information that is known by all members of a community — while common knowledge adds that everybody knows that everyone else knows the information, too.
Although there were moments of levity in the scientific talks, Everett and Pinker left the jokes to the professionals. Similarly, the comedians left the hard science to the scientists. The evening concluded with a question and answer panel, in which all four speakers took to the stage to answer audience questions. Most questions came from the comedians on stage, who had plenty of questions for the two scientists on the nature of their work. Several audience members also asked questions — including Dean Howarth, a theoretical physicist who considers himself to be a “funny scientist.”
“Science can get heavy,” Howarth said after the show.
He said he thought that the merging of science and comedy was a great way to make complicated subjects more accessible to members of the general public. Everett echoed this sentiment when interviewed after the conclusion of the performance.
“I’ve spoken at lots of conferences,” Everett said, “and getting people interested in science in a venue where you can actually make it fun and interesting is a great idea… Getting people excited about pure science is one of the greatest privileges I think a scientist can be involved in.”
Mauss also spoke to the power of combining comedy and science.
“We’re both, scientists and comedians, trying to get to the truth of what’s going on in this world,” he said. “But I think it’s ultimately still trying just to get down to the truth of what reality is about and making observations that aren’t necessarily obvious to other people… Comedy is a tool for uncovering many of the hidden truths of our lives, and so is science.”

In a performance titled “the body as a lasting thing,” Anna K. Antongiorgi ’19 combined poetry with dance at the Leverett Library Theater last Friday and Saturday.
According to the show’s program, the project aimed to combine poetry about the human body — written by Antongiorgi for her English senior thesis — with “actual bodies.” Over the course of the hour-long performance, the poetry and choreography combined to explore themes of what the event description called “physicality, anatomy, and dance.”
A screen to the left of the stage displayed the poems in full as performers clad in neutral tones — pastel blues, grays, and blacks — moved across the floor. Performer Isabel Wu ’20 commented on how the poetry merged with the dancing.
“I think it’s really interesting because it’s not a direct mapping of poetry to choreography. I think the more I read the poems and the more I watched the show and practiced on my own, I kind of understood where the movement was coming from,” Wu said.
During each routine, a poem flashed across the screen just long enough for the audience to read it while also watching the dance. Dancers then moved from their seats at the sides of the theater to center stage while other dancers watched. After finishing a routine, the dancer returned to the sides of the room in time for the next poem to appear. At times, the other seated dancers extended comforting hands to those performing. Although most pieces were solos, some, such as “us trinas” and “a ballet class in socks” incorporated a few or all of the performers.
After receiving Antongiorgi’s poems in January, the dancers began working on the choreography. Daniel P. Rivera ’20, one of the performers, said that not long after returning from break, the dancers began creating their solos “kind of on the spot.”
The performance began with “kind” and “irony embodied or thank you,” two deeply personal poems that touched on Antongiorgi’s own insecurities as well as her friendships.
“I over think digestion,” Antongiorgi confessed in the first poem. “We are comedians in sorrow. I’m grateful,” she wrote in the second.
The fourth poem of the evening, titled “us trinas,” was the first to be read aloud rather than displayed on the screen — and the first to discuss dance explicitly. The poem deals with the toxicity in the dance world. A voice read one of the opening lines — “if the skin touches the fabric, you’ll need to lose it” — as the three dancers stood with their backs turned to the audience and hands firmly placed on their hips, shifting their weight from one foot to the other.
The evening ended with a poem titled “resurface,” which particularly resonated with Devonne D. Pitts ’21, an audience member who found it to be “really powerful.”
“I think that there were a lot of emotions flying in the space and they ended on a happy note,” Pitts said.

The focus of the sanctions conversation desperately needs correction. In my experience, the sanctions debate typically devolves as students restate their personal dispositions towards final clubs under a guise of argument, instead of evaluating the policy’s efficacy. It appears, for the foreseeable future, that the sanctions lawsuits will remain thorns in the sides of both Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and University President Lawrence S. Bacow. Legal experts analyzing the suits believe that they are unlikely to be immediately dismissed. Although the fervor of debate may have cooled, the conversation remains relevant.
Harvard undergraduates and faculty members alike possess a breadth of opinion on the sanctions issue, touting values such as freedom of association, sexual assault prevention, and inclusivity as foundations for these opinions. Yet debates over the comparative weight of inclusivity, safety, and liberty, while relevant and important, are in fact secondary in the conversation about sanctions. The central question should be whether or not the sanctions effectively and efficiently produce the outcome they are designed to produce. In other words, do sanctions do their job?
The first step in assessing any policy is to look to its purpose. In a 2017 statement on the sanctions, then-University President Drew G. Faust condemned the negative impact of final clubs on Harvard’s campus and expressed her desire “to create a community where students have the fair opportunity to engage in curricular and extracurricular activities regardless of their gender, socioeconomic status, or other attributes unrelated to merit.” Faust also quoted the Undergraduate Council, who said, “The negative externalities of Harvard’s divisive social life cannot be ignored. The stratification that many of these groups insert into our community is striking and their impact is widely felt.”
These criticisms exemplify a good-faith effort to improve the College social experience for a majority of Harvard undergraduates. I commend administrators’ efforts to make an inclusive social scene for its students. However, it is not clear to me that targeting final clubs has been the best way to achieve this goal. Harvard is overflowing with highly exclusive organizations, including the Crimson Key Society, the Hasty Pudding Social Club, or the Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine. Though the University may prevent students from congregating in final clubs, these organizations, along with athletic teams, would serve as proxies for final clubs.
More importantly though, the concern of social exclusion, a primary consideration articulated in the letter, is poorly addressed by the sanctions. Although they are separate, male and female final clubs often interact as a community through mixers and other events. So, integrating final clubs would not remotely open up the social scene. This begs the question: What are sanctions for?
Perhaps the administration believes that single-gender clubs are intrinsically immoral due to their discriminatory nature. If this were their stated motivation for the sanctions, the policy might apply adequate pressure to force the clubs to be inclusive to members of all genders. But the sanctions would then be ineffective as their exclusion of other single gender non-social organizations like a cappella groups, many of which do not have gender parity. However, gender dynamics compose only a small part of the general concern previously expressed by the administration.
Another oft-professed virtue of forcing clubs to go co-ed is that doing so would alleviate the problem of sexual assault on Harvard’s campus. Forcing gender integration may reduce instances of sexual assault, but there is no concrete evidence that this is the best way for Harvard to reduce its incidence, given the fact that sexual assault and harassment pervade the University beyond the final club scene. There is also no evidence that there is a sexual assault problem in single gender female organizations; so, if sexual assault were a motivating factor in the policy, it does not make sense to penalize them. As for the all-male organizations, it is sloppy to target every single one. Each social organization has its own unique culture; bundling them all together is unjust as it falsely implicates those who have acted with propriety. The University should be targeting individual perpetrators specifically, instead of taking broad action against organizations. Proper punitive action requires precision.
Further, forcing every all-male club to go co-ed obfuscates individual responsibility for perpetrating assault by blaming groups of men for ensuing sexual misconduct. This attitude toward assault does not hold individuals accountable for their actions by instead condemning the organization. Although a toxic environment may exacerbate bad behavior, the University should be focusing on punishing individual perpetrators, not groups.
Perhaps Harvard does not feel inclined to act with precision in this matter because of its generally negative attitude towards final clubs. Harvard’s policy must be reformed with a more focused approach and redesigned to ensure the policy ensures the outcome the University has professed it desires. Administrators should take into consideration the positive impact that final clubs have on their members without compromising the admirable goals the University has established. Although sanctions do not address the vast majority of problems the University has identified, a reformed policy has the potential to benefit undergraduates and improve student social life. With a defter touch, the University could achieve a more inclusive campus without the crossfire.

As Paul J. Barreira prepares to step down from his post as Director of Harvard University Health Services, he and Harvard University Senior Director of Nursing and Health Promotion Maria Francesconi are taking a much-needed stab at addressing some of the health service shortcomings most immediately felt by Harvard undergraduates. In seeking direct feedback from students, the duo is aiming to improve the quality of healthcare services.
Given the massive overrepresentation of undergraduates in Urgent Care, we hope these improvements will address this possible overdependence, and, if useful, to encourage more widespread engagement with Primary Care services. To that end, we hope HUHS responds to this data by allocating its resources more efficiently, as well as restructuring the process by which undergraduates interact with the Primary Care system.
The data speaks for itself. While undergraduates account for more than 80 percent of Urgent Care visits, only ten percent of students reach out to Primary Care providers before arriving on campus their freshman year — a statistic that, although only available for Primary Care usage prior to freshman year, seems indicative of a broader underutilization of these services.
There are many factors that might explain why undergraduates constitute such a high percentage of Urgent Care traffic. Barreira and Francesconi point to undergraduate’s busy schedules and a general confusion about the assignment of Primary Care physicians. It’s also worth considering the proximity of undergraduate housing to HUHS’s only Urgent Care location — the third floor of the Smith Campus Center, a hub of campus life — in determining whether undergraduates’ disproportionate reliance on Urgent Care is in fact detrimental to student health.
Whether or not this trend is indicative of poor undergraduate access to healthcare, it does point to a need for systemic reform within HUHS. Primary Care services should be significantly improved. At present, as Barreira and Francesconi suggest, the Primary Care system can be daunting for students to negotiate, and that process must be reworked.
Similarly, HUHS should consider putting more effort into the way it connects students with their Primary Care providers. One avenue to explore this would be to send an explicit email introducing students to their Primary Care doctors. Even if this introduction is pro forma, it would likely make students feel more comfortable reaching out to schedule introductory and continued-care appointments. Overall, the Primary Care system and its providers should be strive to always be responsive and readily accessible to students.
Beyond these preliminary suggestions, we look forward to seeing what creative solutions HUHS produces to improve student healthcare. And while Barriera’s long and successful tenure at HUHS has been praiseworthy, his departure provides the opportunity for the University to appoint a successor who understands these challenges and is prepared to tackle them head on. Beyond undergraduate use of Primary and Urgent Care, we hope the new director works to make HUHS and its processes more transparent. Releasing the results of the biannual health survey delayed by Barreira in the fall as well as championing issues of mental health services and opioid usage in the community would be important priorities for a new director.
We continue to be thankful for the effort the HUHS staff puts into providing care to the Harvard community every day, and we look forward to seeing how HUHS pursues tangible improvement to the services it provides under new leadership.

From the moment we receive our Harvard acceptance letters, we are told that it was because of our potential. The potential to continue on our bright paths of success and excellence. But what happens when we hit a roadblock, stumble, or simply tumble right over?
The reality is that our Harvard acceptance letters, at times, come with a false sense of invincibility. We feel entitled in the sense that we expect to receive anything we’ve set our sights on. When our hard work, time, and effort results in failure or rejection, it crushes us — so much so that instead of learning from it, we avoid any and all situations that may not have a favorable outcome. In a world where everyone always wants to look like they are “winning,” we do our best to set it up so we always are.
During my junior fall, I entered the world of recruiting. While I focused on consulting internships, there were many people who cast a wide net and recruited for finance, consulting, tech jobs, and more. I remember having a conversation with someone who didn’t get any consulting offers but was having more success in other industries. They said that they wished they didn’t waste their time on consulting interviews because it wasn’t fruitful. This struck me as odd. I definitely didn’t enjoy the multiple rejections I also received in that season. However, I did ultimately come to view them as a sign that the job or firm was not for me, rather than feel cheated or bitter that I didn’t get an offer. If anything, the invaluable skill of interviewing for a job or even the cool opportunity to travel to another city to visit a company was a learning lesson in itself.
Nevertheless, I do understand this sentiment. Growing up as the “smart girl” before college, I can relate to the fear of failure. At that age, it was easy to feel like that was the entirety of my identity. Any failures at being smart would have been an attack on my personhood as I knew it. While I started growing out of this toward the end of high school and have since come into a strong understanding of who I am despite my intelligence and intellectual accomplishments in my time here, many Harvard students still struggle with this.
When failure is seen as an affront to one’s identity, it is an indication that we have confused who we are with what we do. Our rejection letters and denials, just as much as our wins and successes, do not solely define us. Getting to Harvard and remaining here does not mean that we will succeed at everything we attempt — our potential lies in so much more. Instead of allowing the devastation of failure to handicap us, we should humble ourselves. It is even more harmful to remain in a rosy bubble where we are guaranteed success because it will eventually pop. The less we expose ourselves to the opportunity to fail, the more tragic the result may be.
I will never forget what an older friend told me at my high school graduation: “Don’t confuse your journey with your destination.” It pulled my head out of the clouds I was floating in with thoughts of Harvard ahead of me. Our time at Harvard is just one part of the grander scheme of our lives. The struggles in our path that we will inevitably face here will prepare us for what comes after college. We may be at Harvard because of our potential, but the only way to assuredly succeed here and beyond is to boldly put ourselves in situations where we may fail but ultimately learn and grow from the experience.

On the right side of a brightly lit stage in Radcliffe Yard’s Knafel Center, a figure sits cross-legged on a stool. She sports a black-sequined dress and a glossy bob wig, blinking fluttery false lashes that cast a delicate shadow onto her perfectly contoured face. On the left side of the stage, a similarly made-up person poses, grinning, in a black suit.
Just two hours earlier, this elegantly styled drag queen was delivering the opening remarks for the Radcliffe Institute’s “Beyond Words: Gender and the Aesthetics of Communication” conference as Shigehisa Kuriyama, the Director of the Humanities Program at the Radcliffe Institute. After these remarks, the crowd witnessed the live, on-stage transformation of Kuriyama, as well as History Professor Robin Bernstein.
For one night only, the professors volunteered to adopt new personas for the conference’s kickoff, aptly named “Communication Can Be a… Drag.” In addition to these two metamorphoses, the spectacle featured several drag acts and clips from the documentary “Kings, Queens, & In-Betweens.” Jennifer Burton and Gabrielle Burton, two of the five sisters who produced the film, presented at the conference, offering insight into their inspirations and creative process.
The sisters’ film project, six years in the making, emerged from one of Gabrielle Burton’s experiences: She attended a drag show starring her friend’s husband, aka Virginia West, an award-winning drag queen in Columbus, Ohio. At the time, Burton did not expect that a highly creative and supportive drag community could thrive in this small, Midwestern city. “It was this spectacular presentation on stage of all the issues my sisters and I had been thinking about — about how we divide gender into these binaries,” she says.


In their film, the Burton sisters hoped to reflect on the universality of gender fluidity. They set out to create “a slice of life film about a community and to use that to then reflect the diversity of our experience as humans,” Gabrielle Burton says.
The Burton sisters have approached gender issues from a variety of angles in their work for Five Sisters Productions, their LA-based production company. In their films—which range from features to shorts to documentaries to fiction—they seek to probe the limitations of traditional constructs. Four of the five sisters each have both a daughter and a son. Gabrielle and Jennifer Burton say that parenting has made them even more attuned to how rigid gender norms arise early in childhood in everything from toys and books to activities and friends.


“Often traditional concepts of male and female can really limit us when they’re associated with power, right? So if you think of male behavior being more valued in certain ways or females being valued mostly when they behave in certain traditional ways, it can be very detrimental to people in society,” Jennifer Burton says. “Our event was really a way of opening up a lot of these questions in the very beginning that then reverberate throughout the whole conference.” To Gabrielle Burton, “Communication Can Be a… Drag” provided a fitting and “playful” introduction to a conference meant to examine gender expression.
At the Thursday night event, drag performers confidently stripped off bright orange construction vests to the beat of “We Built This City.” But, previously, many said they once had reservations about doing drag. Rebecca Harrison, aka The Reverend Roy Rogers never expected to do drag professionally. When Harrison’s current troupe of drag kings, The Royal Renegades, asked her to emcee one of their shows, she thought, “I’ll emcee, but there’s no way I’m gonna, like, put hair on my face. There’s no way I’m gonna ever be a performer, but then I threw my hat in the ring, and it was just amazing.”
Similarly, Corey Williams, aka Anisa Love, hesitated to enter the drag world at first. Williams was already a professional dancer and performer for Paramount and Disney. He never regarded drag as a creative outlet but reconsidered after entering a drag competition on a dare and earning his rent in one night. Willliams’s artistic expertise is clear in his drag performances: Anisa Love sashays through the aisles, her crimson lips mouthing the lyrics to “This is Me” from The Greatest Showman as her heavy, jeweled earrings swing to the bass.
For other performers, drag can open up paths for self-discovery. “I grew up female, and I guess I never really felt comfortable being a woman on stage, and it seemed like I was always striving for roles I was never was going to get because I wasn't a guy,” says Ethan K. Balk, aka Dr. Cool Ethan. As a stage performer, he had felt limited by the confined roles women were offered. “I’ve learned so much about gender and the differences between sex and sexuality and all these things, and now I’m able to have conversations with people about that and really help other people around me,” he says.


But the impact of drag is not limited to those who perform it. “Whether or not you are a part of the queer community or not, everyone as a whole benefits from drag because what drag does is it pushes the binaries – what is considered masculine and what is considered feminine,” says Quyen Tran, aka Jayden Jameson KA St. James, an award-winning Boston-area drag king and host of public drag transformation workshops. “What we do on stage forces you guys to think about that type of thing.”
Both Tran and the Burtons see the drag stage as empowering to audience members, granting them the space to ask questions of themselves and discover variations of the gender spectrum that they may have never imagined.
“One thing we were bringing out with this event was that everyone is performing gender at all times. So people sort of think, ‘Oh, drag people are performing gender.’ Well, we all are performing gender by what we wear, how we have our hair, whether or not we have makeup on,” Jennifer Burton says. “For students and other people who are really coming into their own as individuals, I think that these kinds of events, these kinds of questions can allow people to think through who they are inside.”

For the first few weeks of freshman year, I was excited about the food in Annenberg — the pad thai was tangy, the chicken nuggets were crispy, and the cookie bars were decadent. But, during lunch one day in mid-September, I scooped myself a big bowl of HUDS hummus with a side of carrots and pita bread. After a few bites, as I prepared to eat a triangle of pita with a big glob of hummus, I suddenly found an unidentified object in my bowl of hummus. It was a small, white, solid substance. I thought it could be a fingernail, maybe even a tooth.
During Opening Days my friends and I had noticed advertising on the Annenberg napkin holders for a HUDS texting service. We never thought to send a text, but with this unidentified object lingering in my hummus, I sent my inaugural message to HUDS.
After sending the text, I was still hungry, so I continued eating my hummus and avoided the unidentified object. I didn’t get a response, but my friends and I lingered around Annenberg. Around 15 minutes later, a HUDS worker approached our table.
“Who has the item they found in their hummus?” she asked.
The woman carefully investigated the hummus, and if I remember correctly, identified it as a grain of rice. I was no longer interested in the object in my hummus, but I did grow curious about the people behind the HUDS texting feature.
HUDS rolled out the program in July 2017. Students can text the dining hall staff about anything related to their HUDS experience in a particular dining hall. For example, if your comment or question regards Annenberg, you text “Berg” at the beginning of your message to 55744.
David P. Davidson, HUDS Managing Director, explained that the official name for the program is “Text and Tell.” Davidson explained that the texts go to all the managers within the respective houses.
Davidson guesses that around 98 percent of the almost 5,000 messages HUDS has received are of a“positive nature,” whether that be praise for a certain dish or a compliment towards a staff member. The other two percent are typically requests for certain dishes. Through the texting feature, students can also send in recipes from home. That’s how the legendary “Red Spiced Chicken” came to HUDS dining halls.
Davidson says there is no “magic number” of texts that sparks dining hall change. For bigger changes, the texts are incorporated into a formal process: Davidson prints out some messages with requests and hands them over to the Culinary Director to follow up.
Jack C. Lawlor ’22 first began texting HUDS after seeing the advertisement on an Annenberg napkin holder. Lawlor wanted to see more parsnips in the dining hall so he sent the following message to the HUDS line:
“Now I’ve noticed they’ve started putting out bowls of straight parsnips,” Lawlor says. “I’ve wondered if this is because of my grassroots activism.”
Not every text corresponds to change in the dining hall, however. Olivia M. Price ’21, a lover of Honey Oat Clusters, texted HUDS because she was frustrated with the unchanging cereal selection in Mather.
“I texted [HUDS] and I waited a few days but the [Honey Oat Clusters] weren’t there,” Price says. “I texted them again, and they said they like to rotate to everyone’s taste,” she adds, mournfully.

“Now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything, and the one son who had no choice but to keep them all together,” reads the tagline of the popular American sitcom “Arrested Development.” Not everyone would guess that the tagline is better realized in Yiddish — but not everyone is Rachelle T. Grossman, a fourth-year graduate student in the Department of Comparative Literature.
Grossman cleverly integrates the themes of the show into its introduction by replacing the final words of the tagline with the Yiddish phrase “tsunoyfhaltn,” which means “bring together.” But the phrase also has an added financial connotation, one that further emphasizes the family’s struggles.
“I'm surprised this came on anyone's radar,” Grossman says when asked about her decision to translate and record a Yiddish dub of “Arrested Development.” Speaking of the Hasidic community—the primary speakers of Yiddish today—Grossman says, “The [ultra-]Orthodox are not accessing YouTube or the internet much at all,” she says, and the people who are not Orthodox Jews do not speak Yiddish.
So why did she make this dub?
After all, those familiar with the show may be wondering about the lines which depend on English double meanings, such as the iconic “fire sale” scene, which she translated directly nonetheless.
Her project started as an assignment for University of Ottawa Professor Rebecca Margolis’ summer class at the Yiddish Book Center. Since it is difficult to access the “living culture” of Yiddish, Grossman says Margolis used the project as a pedagogical tool to creatively engage with the language.
Though the idea of combining Germanic languages, Slavic languages, Hebrew, Aramaic, L’shon Hakodesh (the Sacred Tongue), and Latin might sound confusing, Yiddish — the product — has been adopted into the casual vernacular vocabulary.
“[Yiddish words have] come to mean something beyond their official Yiddish meaning,” Grossman says. “Why is it that people talk about ‘schlepping’ all the time, or they have a ‘shtick’?” Aspects and fragments of Yiddish have become ubiquitous in our common vocabulary, operating, in Grossman’s words, as “cultural capital, a cultural currency, as a symbolic language.”
Grossman distinguishes between the vernacular and post-vernacular, saying with respect to Yiddish in the media now that “it's not vernacular, it's not meant to communicate in the language. It's meant to communicate something symbolic beyond the language.” Grossman says that, though Yiddish in the post-war era “ceases to be effectively communicative” because of its narrow reach, the tropes are still trafficked beyond Yiddish communities.
For this same project, her friend dubbed “Broad City,” which contains overtly Jewish settings and characters while dealing with themes outside the Yiddish vocabulary. Grossman believes there is “a certain kind of subversiveness in thinking of how to talk about pegging in Yiddish, and these kinds of words where there's a lot of debate about what kind of sexual identity Yiddish can contain.” While the dialogue on Yiddish queer politics is expanding, the language has not yet caught up, and her friend made up new words to express, for example, sexuality.
Sometimes, Grossman found she could add an additional layer of humor to “Arrested Development” by using Yiddish, as she did in translating the tagline. Grossman chose the show — though it is not explicitly Jewish in any way — because she felt the humor could “be better captured, or also captured well, in Yiddish,” she says.
One such instance was family patriarch George Sr.’s imprisonment, which he comes to consider a vacation. Grossman matches this to the Yiddish idiom, “I’m sitting like God in Odessa” since Odessa is considered a godless place in Yiddish culture. Grossman further emphasizes the cultural crossover by Americanizing the term “Odessa” to “Las Vegas.” And so the phrase came to be, “I’m sitting like God in Las Vegas.”
She notes that “the language matched the concept, even though the English didn’t officially.”
Celebrating those small yet meaningful moments urges one to wonder about the future of Yiddish and Yiddish dubbing. Grossman emphasizes that the language “means so many different things to different people,” and that “it can contain a lot of multitudes.”
With respect to media and representation, she says, “There’s a decent sized — I won’t say big world — but a decent-sized world of people who are trying to do creative, interpretive work in Yiddish.” It is now just a matter of finding them, among the crowd, sitting like God in Las Vegas.

David W. Keith’s office is tucked inside a glass skywalk between the Mallinckrodt and Hoffman labs, nestled within a maze of cramped hallways that belie the massive scale of his research. Year after year, the threat of an impending climate catastrophe looms larger in the public consciousness, and Keith, an applied physics professor, is working on a solution.
Keith is a co-director of Harvard’s Solar Geoengineering Research Program, a cross-disciplinary collaboration examining approaches to and policy surrounding solar geoengineering. He leads a group that researches solar geoengineering, a technique that aims to reflect some of the sun’s energy to mitigate global temperature increases. In 2019, Keith, in collaboration with Chemistry Professor Frank N. Keutsch, may become one of the first to execute a controlled experiment in geoengineering.
The experiment is called the Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment. It would test a version of geoengineering called Stratospheric Aerosol Injection, which involves spraying sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere to reflect a small percentage of incoming sunlight. It’s what media outlets have in recent months been calling “dimming the sun.”
SAI is only one of many proposed techniques under the heading of solar geoengineering. Other proposals have included sending mirrors to space, painting mountaintops white, and brightening the clouds over the ocean to make them more reflective. “The idea is actually really old,” Keith says. “In some sense there is not very much innovative here — the idea emerged about the same time as modern understanding of climate.” A number of researchers and advocates of geoengineering suggest that SAI would be one of the most efficient and cost-effective methods for geoengineering.
Geoengineering has encountered significant resistance over the decades. Among the most common critiques of geoengineering is that it’s only a temporary solution that might divert resources from more essential efforts like emissions reduction. But Keith says that geoengineering isn’t intended to be used in isolation.
“Nothing about solar geoengineering changes the fact that if you want a stable climate, you have to bring emissions to zero,” he says. “That ultimately has to involve laws that prevent people using the atmosphere as a waste dump for carbon.”
Despite his research on the topic, Keith is hesitant to say that geoengineering should actually be used. Instead, he says he’s motivated by the conviction that “it’s better to have more knowledge about things.” Given that solar geoengineering has never before been tried, Keith claims that it would be difficult to anticipate the political consequences of his research.
“I think there are a lot of different factors that factor into the political fight between environmental forces and fossil fuels,” Keith says. “I don’t see that some knowledge of [geoengineering] — and, after all, there’s already knowledge about this — would actually shift that boundary.”
Though the aim of solar geoengineering is to mitigate the impacts of climate change, Keith acknowledges the many risks inherent in potential projects, including disturbing the stratosphere’s chemistry and circulation. Additionally, aerosols emitted into the stratosphere would eventually return to the lower atmosphere as air pollutants.
Yet Keith suggests that solar geoengineering would likely have a large positive impact on disadvantaged regions of the world. “Solar geoengineering tends to reduce extreme precipitation and extreme temperature and the change in water availability,” he says. “Those are all things that tend to affect the most vulnerable the most. The relative benefits of solar geoengineering are likely larger for the population that’s most vulnerable to climate change, which, is in general, people who are poor.”
Still, Keith admits that any proposal for geoengineering comes with a great deal of baggage, and he says he shares concerns about the use of geoengineering in practice. To Keith, research must be conducted impartially, removed from the influence of fossil fuel interests.
“I think work on solar geoengineering should be strongly noncommercial. I think we should try to ban commercial work, and I think it is very important to be open access and we try and stamp out patenting and really stamp out private money,” he says. “I think that’s really important because for solar geoengineering, there’s no need to make it cheaper. It’s probably already too cheap.”
The risks inherent in geoengineering are steep, as Keith is among the first to admit. “There is a coherent case to ban [geoengineering] research altogether,” he says, in reference to its potential hindrance of emissions reduction research.
Still, he presses on.

The night before Valentine’s Day, some friends and I sat on a dorm futon and filled out our Datamatch profiles. We peered over another friend’s shoulder as he slowly finished his profile, the last of the group. When Datamatch asked whom he was interested in matching with, he clicked “women” and moved on to writing a joke for his bio.
“Wait, whoa,” my other friend objected. “You didn’t include gender non-binary?” Datamatch Boy was a little taken aback. I don’t think he had considered this to be a problem. He said he just wasn’t interested in dating someone who was gender non-binary.
“Just not being into” gender non-binary people might feel fine as a cloud of an idea floating in your own head. But, when it takes solid form, when it becomes a sentence you repeat several times out loud, it starts to sound bad. “Okay, okay,” our second friend said with a voice that suggested it might not have in fact been okay — as in, a resigned — “if that’s really what you think is best.” Was it right to challenge Datamatch Boy? What does it mean to involve yourself in the boundaries of someone else’s desires?
Recently, I’ve been thinking a lot about an essay called “Does Anyone Have the Right to Sex?” by a philosopher named Amia Srinivasan. She asks how it’s possible to have good sex when we know our every sexual wish has been determined by a spurious cocktail of patriarchy, racism, ableism, transphobia, and other biases. Srinivasan’s argument emerges in the legacy of the “sex wars,” a debate that originated in the late 1970s. On one side, there was an “anti-porn” feminism and, on the other, a “sex-positive” feminism. Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin led the “anti-porn” contingent, which held that all desire is political and that sex under patriarchy is inevitably violent. The “sex-positive” philosophy, which developed partly as a response to “anti-porn” feminism, contended that sexual desire is inherently private and that questioning it is a form of sexual “authoritarian moralism.” They believed that “anti-porn” feminism threatened to assign a type of false consciousness to women and make sexual pleasure under oppressive systems impossible.
But, leaving everyone to their own desires has its risks too. It demands that we chalk up factors like patriarchy, racism, ableism, fatphobia, and transphobia — which influence our desires — to what Srinivasan calls the “seemingly innocuous mechanism of ‘sexual preference.’” Sex-positive feminists intend to affirm trust in female desire, but assuming that all desires are a matter of simple preference can obscure the fact that some are based in discrimination.
Datamatch Boy’s profile choices seemed a perfect example of systems of oppression working their way into our subconsciousnesses. By questioning Datamatch Boy’s choice not to include gender non-binary people, my other friend proposed that our desires must be scrutinized and called out for their roots in systems of oppression. But did the call-out transform Datamatch Boy’s desires? I wondered if anyone had ever asked him if he was interested in gender non-binary people. Did he just assume he wasn’t?
Recently, I went to dinner with a friend and we talked about limits on desire. My friend didn’t think it was automatically transphobic to say you aren’t attracted to trans people. But I argued that often, in the realm of desire, it’s easy to think of transgender people in the abstract, drawing from a definitively transphobic blend of media images and stereotypes rather than thinking of trans people as individuals within a group.
Among the people I know at college, it’s a given that “you can’t have a thing” for people of one race. My friends agree, for example, that it’s racist to “be into" women of Asian descent. But, who you are into can be easier to address than who you’re not into.
Exclusivity in desire can be very easy to miss and almost as easy to perpetrate. Oppression, latent in society, draws limits around our desire. We don’t often notice these boundaries as they arise, and we don’t always think about the fact that they are there. We only realize that we restrict certain groups from our desire in situations like making a Datamatch profile, situations that force us to make an active decision about who we want to include in our desire.
It seems like, even 40 years after the sex wars, “sexual preference” is often treated as inviolably personal and therefore immune from scrutiny. What if the new standard was to insist that no, you’re not allowed to hold any set of desires without explaining why?
I think what’s most freeing about confronting and questioning our desires is that if you look at them long enough, our desires and our limitations upon them can change. As Srinivasan writes, “Our sexual preferences can and do alter, sometimes under the operation of our own wills — not automatically, but not impossibly either.”
A friend of mine was screwed over romantically this year. I talked about this with another person who quipped that boys on this campus are “obsessed with little white girls.” We couldn’t think of another reason for the betrayal. As is often the case in romantic disappointment, there was no logical explanation, no way to trace the steps or factors that had led to the letdown. In another timeline, with another group of friends, insecurity would have shaded the aftermath, self-doubt dominating the autopsy. Instead, we shifted blame from self to system.
It feels to me that a certain hopeful strain of the anti-porn, MacKinnon-ite philosophy of desire prevails on Harvard’s campus. In challenging easily -missed exclusions from desire, we are finding a middle ground between draconian scrutiny and the sheltering of oppressive systems behind “personal preference.” When sexual desire is examined, we begin to neutralize murky threats to morale while wading through the dating pool.

Sarah W. Newman answers her front door in a beanie, a vest, and legwarmers. She tells us to keep our coats on as she leads us to her basement studio. As we descend the precariously narrow staircase, the air becomes cold and still. There’s no heating, and insulation peeks out from the space where the ceiling meets the walls. Newman is unphased. She spends hours at a time here working on projects; her current undertaking stretches about sixteen feet across the basement floor. Only part of it is visible –– the rest is folded up in various boxes.
“Do you trust the calculator on your phone?”
“Would you rather be a bug or a baby?”
“Is a tree moral?”
Parts of these phrases peek out from beneath the giant, laser-cut stencils, splashed with blue and yellow spray chalk, spread across the floor which form the basis of her project, “Moral Labyrinth.” The spray chalk is a remnant of the project’s last iteration, when Newman carried the stencils to a Somerville bike path and sprayed the questions onto the concrete for passersby to ponder.


“Moral Labyrinth” is Newman’s take on labyrinths traditionally used for meditation. In Newman’s version, words written on the ground replace the usual lines, and as the viewer walks, they are encouraged to think critically about the ethical questions posed.
“[Moral Labyrinth] is just unpacking what it even means to be moral,” Newman says. “The questions are meandering through the whole space of morality.”
The labyrinth’s goal is to create an intellectually provocative experience for each viewer. It attempts to explore philosophical and artistic ideas in a way that is accessible to the everyday observer. This focus on viewer experience and participation is typical of metaLAB (at) Harvard, where Newman is an artist-researcher.
MetaLAB is an organization within the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society that describes itself as an “idea foundry.” A foundry, technically, is a workshop for casting metal, and while many of metaLAB’s projects are more concerned with artificial intelligence than iron forging, a material focus drives much of their work.
“The digital is not immaterial, it’s not some realm alternate to the realm we inhabit as human beings. We think of it as very palpable and material,” says metaLAB founder Professor Jeffrey T. Schnapp. “What we’re interested in is our forms of ideation that translate into our forms of practice.”
MetaLAB’s “forms of practice” range from encouraging strangers to spill their darkest secrets before a wooden box to making beer and bread out of invasive plant species. They strive to combine the technological with the traditional, the digital with the sensory — and no matter what they do, it’s always unexpected.
To find metaLAB, visitors must climb five flights of stairs in a building that suspiciously resembles a house but is actually office space at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design. Schnapp’s office can be found at the end of the upward climb. The office looks largely standard — a mess of coffee cups and papers are scattered across Schnapp’s desk, which sits in the middle of the open floor plan of the attic space.
A few unconventional features of the office stand out: an “inflatable workspace,” reminiscent of a large aluminum tarp, is rolled up on the floor; extremely tall artist’s stools are the room’s primary seating; and several drawings on yellowed paper, including one of a wolf, decorate the wall.
Before coming to metaLAB, we assumed the organization fit squarely into the “digital humanities” scene, a constantly evolving field that applies technology, data, and computer science to humanities work. But when we ask Schnapp about his perception of the digital humanities, he corrects us.
“MetaLab was founded with the intention of creating; [it is] less of a digital humanities center and more of an experimental platform,” he explains.
Associate Director Matthew R. Battles has a more straightforward take. He perceives digital humanities as a field squarely situated within academia. MetaLAB, on the other hand, exists “outside of the structure of departments and disciplines,” Battles says. “We’re interested in doing work and expressing ourselves creatively.”
MetaLAB is the descendant of the Stanford Humanities Lab, which Schnapp ran for 10 years while a professor at Stanford. He founded metaLAB in 2011 when he came to Harvard and now works jointly as a comparative literature professor and the faculty director of metaLAB.
“We’re very interested in knowledge infrastructures,” Schnapp says. A great deal of metaLAB’s work focuses on the “creative and critical uses of data,” as he describes it, and that necessitates building software and interacting with museums, libraries, and archives. “But most of all,” he continues, “we’re interested in creating stuff, in making stuff, and it goes out into the world.”
MetaLAB’s research is focused on projects that break down barriers between disciplines. For instance, Newman’s ‘Moral Labyrinth’ uses art to ask hard questions about ethics and the future of artificial intelligence. MetaLAB’s seminar Library Test Kitchen, offered for Graduate School of Design and Faculty of Arts and Sciences students, focuses on creating new technological and design-centered innovations for libraries, such as WiFi-proof booths and study carrels for napping.
“We don’t use the word humanities to describe metaLAB, because a lot of the projects we work on, are they humanities? Well, yeah… but do they stop in the humanities? No,” Schnapp says. MetaLAB’s work extends into countless other disciplines, and this interdisciplinary focus is Schnapp’s hope for the university’s future.
”Some of these [disciplinary] partitions that we inherited from the 19th century don’t really make much sense anymore,” says Schnapp. “I don’t think they made a lot of sense in the 20th century, and I think they make even less sense in the 21st.”
So if metaLAB does not fall under the umbrella of digital humanities, the question remains: what is metaLAB?
“One of the things about metaLAB is because we’re so small, to some extent the projects that we’re working on in any given moment are shaped by the interests of folks who are there.”
Jessica L. Yurkofsky speaks from experience. She currently serves as metaLAB’s principal creative technologist, though she has been involved with the lab ever since she completed her Master’s degree in urban planning at the Graduate School of Design. She took the course Library Test Kitchen and has been interested in libraries ever since. Yurkofsky’s unconventional title and multidisciplinary academic background are largely representative of the fluidly defined, post-disciplinary nature of metaLAB’s projects.
According to Schnapp, metaLab’s projects can be loosely divided into three pillars: art and technology; academic collections, like museums and libraries; and technology and the natural world.
The projects currently in progress largely fluctuate between the pillars of art and technology and academic collections. Yurkofsky’s most recent project fits somewhere in the collections category, though trying to definitively categorize metaLAB’s projects is almost as difficult as trying to define metaLAB itself.
Yurkofsky’s project, which was done in collaboration with Harvard's Library Innovation Lab, is called “Alterspace,” and it is currently housed in a small, glass-walled room near the check-in desk of the Cambridge Public Library. Alterspace is a massive pod constructed from plywood and white tarps –– inside, the plywood is lined with color-changing light strips, and several pairs of headphones hang from the rafters near the four chairs inside. A rolling cart and an iPad attest to the pod’s purpose: users can have a seat, pick a premade light and sound combination depending on what they want to accomplish inside the pod (such as meditating, reading, or creating), and change the settings to fit their needs.
“I don’t know if you’ve read ‘Harry Potter,’ but it was kind of inspired by the Room of Requirement,” Yurkofsky says. “We think of libraries as this space that is designed to give you what you need, so what would a Room of Requirement in a library look like?”
Inside the colorful glowing room, the links between art and technology are undeniable. Yurkofsky drew upon her knowledge of design, technology, and color science in order to bring her vision to life.
Unique implementations of technology and a focus on human interaction are at the center of many metaLAB projects, regardless of which pillar they fall under. Newman, the artist who created “Moral Labyrinth,” generally makes projects under the “arts and technology” pillar, though she has also utilized spaces in museums and libraries. Ultimately, her artistic questions focus on human engagement with technology, particularly with regard to artificial intelligence.
“Moral Labyrinth” asked general ethical questions of its viewers, but another one of her projects,“The Future of Secrets,” got more personal. This project was shown at Houghton Library among other locations. “Secrets” asked viewers to write down their secrets on pieces of paper and slip them into an old wooden box. When someone put their secret in the box, a mechanism was triggered, and the box surprised them by reading another person’s secret aloud in a mechanical, Siri-esque voice. The unnerving project aimed to explore the relationship between privacy, surveillance, and artificial intelligence.


“Secrets” was exhibited multiple times in multiple different forms, from the Museum of Fine Arts to the MIT Media Lab. It was part of the MFA’s #mfaNOW Overnight program three years ago, when the museum stayed open for 24 hours. Rather than a wooden box, “Secrets” at the MFA consisted of a room with a computer, a printer, and digital script on the wall that read, “DO YOU HAVE A SECRET?” When patrons entered their own secret, the machine printed out someone else’s.


A different metaLAB project turns the tables. Instead of the computer asking users a question, the users ask the computer to perform a seemingly simple, but actually impossible task. The project, which is not yet available to the public, is called “Distinction Machine” and is currently being developed by Kim S. Albrecht, a Data Visualization Designer based in Berlin. Distinction Machine asks the computer to display two colored rectangles in the same position, but the computer does not know which color to make visible. The result is a rectangle that flashes erratically between the two colors, and Albrecht uses this technique to create dizzying patterns of flashing shapes and colors as the webpage progresses.


Typical to metaLAB staff, Albrecht’s academic and career interests have strayed off the beaten path. Albrecht has a master’s degree in interface design –– a subject he describes as a mixture of computer science and design –– but is now getting his Ph.D. in philosophy and media theory.
When asked what he considers his professional title to be, he pauses. “I don’t know. I've always struggled with what to call myself,” he says.“I think on my website it says ‘aesthetic researcher’ but that's a bit pretentious. I don't know that I want to be put into a box...I don't know that we need to boil it down to this one thing, or this one sentence, or this one word that's supposed to represent yourself.”
Albrecht is one of the many researchers who have worked on Curricle, a project that reimagines the Harvard course search using a database of all the classes taught since the 1930s. A beta version of the website was released during shopping week this past fall. Curricle was created with the mission of exploration in mind, encouraging students to engage differently with the course website and explore the history of Harvard’s classes.


Curricle might have more practical applications than some other metaLAB projects, but it is driven by similar questions: how do we engage with technology, and what can we learn about ourselves through that process?
MetaLAB itself, however, is consistently focused on making physical things, and this attention to the tactile world informed Curricle’s design. “Back in the day they used to have these handheld course catalogs, and people really liked it because you could leaf through them and stumble upon a class pretty randomly,” says Maia L. Suazo-Maler ’19, who worked on Curricle as a student intern the summer after her sophomore year. “There was an element of surprise and randomization that people felt was lost when they put [the catalog] onto my.harvard and searched just by a keyword… I think they wanted to reinject that sense of exploration into the course system.”
Exploration and experimentation are linchpins of metaLAB — the lab may be undefinable in many ways, but curiosity is a driving force.
“Everyone’s meandered their way through these different fields and disciplines and has essentially found an environment where they can create their job based on their interests and skills,” Newman says. “It’s a bunch of quirky, creative people with a lot of ideas and interests who are making work to better the world.”
It’s safe to say that metaLAB doesn’t easily fit into a common definition in academia –– in an institution like Harvard, which metaLAB’s employees describe as focused on disciplinary boundaries, the lab is a rarity. Its goal is to exist outside of traditional structures. Some, like Schnapp, hope that ignoring these “partitions,” might mean that these boundaries eventually don’t hold so much weight.
Newman’s basement is a testament to the interdisciplinary tangle that metaLAB has created. After showing us the stencils, she unrolls a large paper panel, one of five from an earlier, hanging version of “Moral Labyrinth.” She weighs it down with a pile of books about artificial intelligence and the ethics of superpowered technology.


She describes the questions that make up the labyrinth, which are designed to be Socratic. “You’re not supposed to answer,” she says. “They don’t have a right or wrong answer, but they’re meant to be suggestive and getting you to think, and maybe lead you down a path.
On the panel, one question stands out: “Are there some things we just cannot know?”

The Undergraduate Council boasts an annual operating budget of $650,000 that is distributed each year across several categories: administering student services, putting on campus-wide events, and funding student-run clubs.
That budget, derived from the recently increased Student Activities Fee and funding from the Office of Student Life, is sufficient to finance many of the UC’s projects. Despite this significant budget, however, it cannot afford to fully fund the many initiatives students propose every semester. From providing convenient transportation to purchasing textbooks and dorm supplies, addressing needs across the College is an expensive endeavor.
When established multi-million and multi-billion dollar companies already have solutions to student life challenges, the UC partners with them at no cost to bring these technologies to campus without needing to further subsidize student projects.
Through many of these partnerships, the UC is able to exchange on-campus publicity for companies for discounted services available to the entire student body. The benefits derived from some marketing campaigns directly support internal UC programming for its representatives.
After losing his UC presidential bid in fall 2018, Daniel K. Ragheb ’20 approached UC President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 and Vice President Julia M. Huesa ’20 about ways he could continue to support the council’s work. They invited him to begin surveying students who live in the Quad about their transportations needs and concerns.
After receiving more than 100 responses in a few days — of which roughly 93 percent of respondents said they would use a free or discounted transportation service every weekend if it existed on campus — Ragheb decided to act on this apparent need. He said the unusually high survey participation convinced him that transportation issues were salient for students who do not live in River houses.
“People are scared to walk home in the dark; people are annoyed by the fact that they have to wait 45 minutes in the cold for the next shuttle,” Ragheb said. “This is something on people's minds.”
The UC had already planned to collaborate with ride-sharing company Lyft to arrange discounts for Harvard students, and after Ragheb’s survey identified transportation concerns among Quad students, he was invited to the table. Now, UC leadership and Lyft are in discussions about a partnership to provide affordable evening transportation that is faster and more convenient for some students than evening van and shuttle services.
“Whether helping students get home late or to a nearby event, Lyft is available to provide affordable and reliable transportation to the Harvard student body,” Lyft Communications Manager Daniel Roberts wrote in an email.
This partnership is one of several projects the UC has initiated in recent years to bring discounts and convenience to students across the College. While Quad residents served as an inspiration for this initiative, Lyft programs at other universities suggest the benefits may ultimately extend to everyone on campus.
At the University of California, Los Angeles, for example, the company offers cheaper flat rates for all rides that originate on their campus and travel to other affiliated buildings, according to a Lyft blog post.
UC Representative Alexa C. Jordan ’22, on the other hand, was canvassing dorms in Ivy Yard for general feedback when a student suggested the UC look into starting an umbrella sharing program for rainy days in Cambridge. The proposal quickly transformed into conversations about a collaboration with UmbraCity, a Canada-based company.
“This is an effort to have the UC be efficient, effective, and impactful to students,” Jordan said.
In 2016, UmbraCity tested an umbrella-sharing service at the University of British Columbia’s Vancouver campus to “solve the frustration of getting soaked in the rain due to the loss, breakage or simply forgetfulness in the possession of an umbrella,” according to UmbraCity’s website.
Partnering with Harvard would be UmbraCity’s first American venture. Based on current conversations with the UC, UmbraCity umbrellas would be available free for 24-hour rental periods for students and faculty, according to the company’s founder and CEO Amir Entezari.
But not all partnerships feature externally run companies. The UC has also sought to back Harvard students’ ventures. The council recently sponsored College X Change, an online commerce platform specifically aimed at Harvard students.
Milton K. Dorceus ’19 and Kervens Fonrose co-founded College X Change because they saw a need for a single platform students could use to buy and sell items. After launching in summer 2017, it has since expanded to 300 users.
“Seeing a lot of people selling and trying to push things on GroupMe, email lists, the Facebook free and for sale pages — there are so many avenues that no one knows where to go,” Dorceus said. “For me, I envision that there can be a cultural change in which everyone knows that there’s one place to go to buy and sell things from each other, even give things away for free, and that would just make things so much easier, so much more efficient.”
The UC has helped publicize College X Change by including the platform in email blasts and other promotional materials, according to Dorceus.
“I just really found a lot of value in the UC just given it’s a student led organization and it’s an established organization on campus that a lot of individuals respect,” Dorceus said.
While many of the UC’s partnerships serve College students at large, they also maintain a special partnership with Harvard Student Agencies. Through this, the council secures additional funds it can then use for its own activities and operating budget in exchange for publicity and support.
The UC advertises the Harvard One Ring, a college ring sold by The Harvard Shop and fulfilled by Balfour, a graduation product company. The UC’s original contract, which ran from 2015 to 2019, required the UC to send promotional emails over its lists, display the HSA logo on certain council websites, and have the UC President speak at the One Ring ceremony held annually during Junior Family Weekend.
The contract also mandated that the board meet twice a year to discuss and distribute advertising duties for the coming semester, as well as to provide the UC with its semesterly compensation capped at $1,500.
UC Treasurer Jack M. Swanson ’22 said the council partners with organizations like HSA to raise additional funds on top of what it receives from the College, helping to cover the council’s own activities and costs without diverting funds from the general student population.
“The idea is that we should not spend student term bill money on those issues because those are, like, internal UC affairs and have nothing to do with the student money,” Swanson said.
The initial contract expired at the beginning of 2019, but the UC has continued to advertise the rings as they renew their agreement with HSA. The success of the One Ring contract, Swanson said, led to discussions on further partnerships between the UC and HSA. Both organizations are now looking to partner on events during Visitas, the College’s annual weekend for accepted students hosted in April, and expand their advertising efforts to admitted students.
“In the future, we're sort of working on more partnerships with HSA for the same reason,” Swanson explained. “The mutually beneficial aspect is that UC needs money, HSA needs advertising, and it tends to work out that way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rhodes Scholar and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipient Jin K. Park ’18-’19 testified before a House Judiciary Committee Hearing on Immigration Policy in Washington, D.C., Wednesday.
Park, who became the first-ever DACA recipient to win the Rhodes Scholarship in November 2018, spoke about his experiences as an undocumented immigrant and the effect of recent immigration policy changes. Park made national headlines shortly after receiving the award because he risks being unable to return to the United States after studying abroad at the University of Oxford on the scholarship due to his status as a DACA recipient.
DACA is an Obama-era policy that allows undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children to live and work legally in the country. But after President Trump's Administration moved to eliminate the program and federal judges blocked that effort, U.S. Citizenship and Immigrations Services eliminated a specific provision of the program that allows recipients to travel outside the country under limited circumstances, such as for educational purposes.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in a Tuesday faculty meeting that Harvard has “connected” Park with legal counsel from law firm WilmerHale, which is representing him pro-bono.
Wednesday morning, Park joined seven other witnesses to testify at a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee in light of the Trump administration’s decisions to dismantle a series of programs preventing certain immigrants’ deportations. In addition to Park, the panel also included individuals with Temporary Protected Status and Deferred Enforced Departure — programs that give immigrants from particular countries temporary legal status in the U.S. or allow the president to temporarily pardon some groups of undocumented immigrants, respectively.
The panel also featured immigration advocates and experts, and a bishop from the archdiocese of Washington, D.C. The eight witnesses answered questions about the impact of recent policy changes on undocumented immigrants and the country as whole.
As the first witness to testify, Park described boarding a plane bound for Flushing, Queens from South Korea when he was seven years old in the aftermath of the 1997 financial crisis in East Asia. He recounted knowing absolutely no English on his first day of school except for the words “Home Alone” — the movie he watched on the plane.
He also recalled the moment when, after attempting to volunteer at a local hospital at age 15 and being told by an administrator that the hospital “didn’t allow illegal aliens,” he learned for the first time that he was undocumented.
“That’s the perpetual reality of being undocumented,” he said before the committee. “No matter how hard I work or what I achieve I’ll never know if I ever have a place in America, my home.”
Park also spoke about how his parents’ sacrifices help reassure him that his fight for immigrant rights is worth it, even when it becomes challenging.
“Sometimes I get discouraged about the discourse and the dialogue around immigration. And I think when I do get discouraged I just look at my father’s hands. You know, they’re rough and coarse and broken because of the kind of work that my parents do — ultimately for me,” he said. “And I stand before you today as a DACA recipient, but my achievements and ability to succeed in America do not exist without my parents.”
When Committee Chairman U.S. Representative Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) asked Park to explain what he thought about the “concept of belonging,” Park said that he wanted to detach the validity of calling the United States his “home” from his achievements as a Harvard Rhodes Scholar — a sentiment he repeated throughout the hearing.
“America to me is home,” he said later in his testimony. “I don’t think that my achievements have anything to do with the fact that I’ve grown up here and I’ve made deep and profound connections to the people and the institutions and the practices here.”
While discussing what he believes truly establishes America as his home, Park described familiar memories from Flushing.
“I think about waiting in one of my mom’s beauty salons right after school until she gets off work,” he said. “I think about the fact that my bodega knows exactly how I like my bacon, egg, and cheese.”

Former Harvard Law School Lecturer Alan Jenkins ’85 will join the school’s faculty as a professor of practice in July and teach courses on race, communications, and social justice, the Law School announced Tuesday.
Jenkins, who taught a course entitled "Communications, Law and Social Change" at the Law School in 2016, is the co-founder and president of The Opportunity Agenda — a civic engagement and social justice communication lab that “uses a unique combination of communication expertise and creative engagement to help social justice leaders tell a better story,” according to the organization’s website.
“I am excited to join the Harvard Law School faculty at this pivotal moment for our constitutional democracy,” said Jenkins in a press release. “Preparing emerging leaders to uphold fairness and equal justice is as important now as at any time in our nation’s history.”
Jenkins studied Psychology and Social Relations at the College, holds a J.D. from the Law School, and an M.A. in Media Studies from the New School for Public Engagement in New York. After finishing his law degree, Jenkins subsequently clerked for U.S. District Court Judge Robert L. Carter and Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun ’29.
Before founding The Opportunity Agenda, Jenkins worked in the U.S. Department of Justice as Assistant to the Solicitor General. His work included representing the United States before the Supreme Court in constitutional and other litigation. He also acted as associate counsel for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Legal Defense and Educational Fund, defending low-income communities from exploitation and discrimination, according to the release.
Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 said in a press release that Jenkins brings significant experience and the legal expertise to Harvard’s campus.
“Alan is one of the country's leading thinkers on the relationship between media, public opinion, law, policy and ensuring opportunity for all Americans,” Manning said. “I am thrilled that he will be bringing to Harvard Law students his expertise on what today’s lawyers and leaders need to be effective communicators for their cause.”
Jenkins has also served as a commentator on broadcast outlets including MSNBC and CNN, and print publications such as the New York Times and the Huffington Post.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Emma Dench discussed her current role at Harvard and her career trajectory in an interview at the Smith Campus Center Wednesday evening conducted by Khalil Abdur-Rashid, Harvard’s first full-time Muslim chaplain.
The interview marked the second installment of “Life Matters,” a discussion series hosted by Abdur-Rashid that offers students the opportunity to learn from the insights and life experiences of members of Harvard’s academic community. During the conversation, Dench answered questions about challenges she has faced throughout her academic career and at Harvard.
Dench, who assumed the deanship last year, said her biggest challenge is strategizing about raising the profile of GSAS students at the University.
“It can seem a quite college focused experience and [I’m] just really trying to focus in on the very particular experience and the needs of the graduate students,” Dench said. “That’s something I think about obsessively.”
She said her “big obsession,” however, is bolstering the faculty-student advising relationship at GSAS — a commitment she outlined an interview last year. According to a January 2018 student life survey conducted by GSAS, nearly 10 percent of graduate students have concerns about the quality of their relationship with their primary adviser.
“I’m gearing up in GSAS to launch this hopefully in the fall to look into what is good advising and how can we really up the standard of advising,” Dench said Wednesday.
Dench also described her passion for academics. Throughout her time studying classics at the University of Oxford, however, Dench said she faced both self-imposed and external pressures, which led her to decide to take a year off.
“It was the most rebellious, strangely, that I had been in my life,” Dench said. “I basically walked out of college and it was a really self-determining moment.”
Dench, who is now also a professor of History and Classics, said she was able to rediscover her love for the classics and, more broadly, learning during her year away from school.
“I gave myself permission to pick and choose among philosophies and to work out what life was really about,” Dench said.
Sheridan N. Marsh ’20, who attended the talk, said hearing Dench’s experiences with academic obstacles was interesting.
“At Harvard, there’s this expectation that your life has to be a certain way to end up in a certain place, but clearly Dench went through a lot of hard times in school which I was really surprised by because she’s so smart,” Marsh said.
GSAS student Ahsen N. “Nimet” Cebeci, who also attended the event, said she appreciated the conversation about advising during the interview.
“I appreciate the idea that when it comes to advising students, there are people at Harvard who have our mental health — not only in mind and in their hearts — but also who are capable of empathizing with and really helping, not just through a kind of sympathetic outlook, but also through shared experience,” Cebeci said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences’ Graduate Student Council approved a resolution declaring their official support for the graduate student union’s proposal to include sexual harassment and discrimination in grievance procedures at their monthly open meeting Wednesday.
Prior to passing the resolution, representatives from the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers explained their proposed policies —which they call the #NoCarveOut proposal — and fielded questions from attendees. Graduate students at the council meeting also debated the Office of Diversity and Minority Affairs’ rules for funding student groups, which some called unfair.
The GSC decided to expedite the vote on their resolution of support — originally scheduled for April — and then voted unanimously, with one abstention, to support the union’s grievance procedure proposal, which if included in their contract would provide the option to choose neutral third party arbitration in cases of sexual harassment and discrimination. Currently, the University oversees such cases, whereas third party arbitration takes judgement out of the University’s hands.
Union members made the case for their proposal, arguing that third party arbitration is necessary to eliminate any conflict of interest that might arise when the University has to investigate its own faculty or staff, or seeks to protect its image.
“Instead of having to go to an office that is ultimately run by Harvard and in some sense is biased towards protecting Harvard’s interests, you go to an outside arbitrator — who is paid in equal parts by the union, who represents you there, and the University, so there’s no conflict of interest,” said bargaining committee member Cole M. Meisenhelder.
The proposed policies would not preclude students from choosing to use existing University procedures; third-party arbitration would serve as an additional option, according to union organizer Erik Baker. He added that while the grievance policy would initially raise dues by a voted-on amount, increased use of the arbitration process would not further raise the dues rate.
Meisenhelder said that the Harvard bargaining unit continues to oppose including sexual harassment or discrimination cases in the neutral third-party grievance procedure clause.
“This grievance procedure is going to be in the contract no matter what,” Baker said. “The University says that that’s fine as a way to treat every other contract violation, but in the specific case of sexual harassment and discrimination you have to only use the institutions that exist at the present.”
University spokesperson Johnathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that if included in the contract, the union’s proposal would lack the “thoroughness, fair play, and due process” of Harvard’s investigatory process. He added that a third-party arbitrator would not have any legal power to punish faculty, students, or other employees who are found guilty of misconduct.
“The University continues to approach these negotiations in good faith, with a commitment to reaching an agreement that is good for student workers, all students and the University. While differences around this and other proposal remain, we are committed to the negotiation process and look forward to continuing to sort through these important issues with our HGSU-UAW colleagues,” Swain wrote.
The GSC also updated attendees on their most recent meeting with GSAS deans, during which they discussed problems students had voiced with the GSAS Office of Diversity and Minority Affairs’ funding process, after some students took issue with ODMA’s decision against funding the GSAS LatinX Student Association.
The ODMA currently provides additional funding to three student groups that serve as “umbrella” groups, according to GSAS spokesperson Ann Hall. The three funded groups are LGBTQ@GSAS, Harvard Graduate Women in Science and Engineering, and the W.E.B Du Bois Graduate Society — a social affinity group for all underrepresented students at GSAS. The money these groups receive can be upwards of $10,000.
Audience member Aaron R. Benavidez, the President of Finance for the GSAS LatinX Student Association, said that when the LatinX Student Association met with the ODMA in fall 2018 to ask for funding, ODMA declined the request and offered “administrative support” instead, stating that the LatinX Student Association does not qualify as an umbrella group. Benavidez called ODMA’s decision a “trivialization of the Latinx identity.”
“This is really about supporting Latinx students who are undersupported,” Benavidez said. “It’s absurd that we ask ODMA for $11,000… pennies at Harvard, dust on pennies.”
“It’s absurd that we have to spill so much email ink just sort of saying, ‘Can you just give us $11,000 so we don’t have to go through reimbursement processes?’ One former leader has a child, and she told me she needed reimbursement to buy her kid diapers. Some of us are not very wealthy. We’re graduate students,” he added.
Hall declined to comment late Wednesday night.
The GSC also revealed that during its meeting with GSAS administrators, GSAS Dean Emma Dench announced the launch of the Dean Portal program — an online tool where graduate students can directly message any GSAS dean — to increase accessibility between GSAS students and administrators.
The GSC also passed its first resolution this semester: ratifying proposed changes to the way graduate students fund the Ivy+ Conference, an annual graduate student leadership conference for Ivy League schools, Stanford, and the University of Chicago.

“Here in Harvard Yard, we must embrace diversity in every possible dimension, because as Governor Baker said so eloquently, we learn from our differences — and that includes ideological diversity,” University President Lawrence S. Bacow told a crowd of hundreds at his inauguration in October 2018.
During the first eight months of his presidency, Bacow has traveled across the country communicating this same message. In trips from Michigan to California, he has sought to change perceptions of Harvard as an East Coast, liberal, elitist institution. In five separate trips to Washington, D.C., he has met with lawmakers across the aisle.
Despite Harvard’s concerted effort to present a non-partisan front, many members of the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — still maintain strong, traceable ties to Democrats.
The 12-member body currently includes former Obama administration officials, outspoken critics of President Donald Trump, and a number of high-spending political donors who overwhelmingly give to Democratic candidates and campaign finance committees.
Since 1990 — the earliest date for which data was available — members of the Corporation and Bacow have collectively donated more than $2.7 million to Democratic candidates and campaign finance committees in federal elections, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics and the Federal Election Commission. $322,149 has gone to Republican candidates and organizations in that same time period.
Out of these thirteen individuals, only two Corporation members — James W. Breyer and Paul J. Finnegan ’75 — have given the majority of their political donations to Republican candidates or political organizations.
Bacow — who served on the Corporation from 2011 until he assumed the presidency in July — has donated more than $9,000 to Democrats since 1990, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In the most recent election cycle, he donated $1,000 to U.S. Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.).
Penny S. Pritzker ’81 is by far the most significant donor among Corporation members, giving over $1.5 million to Democrats since 1990. She also gave $22,000 to Republicans between 1996 and 2006.
A member of the Pritzker family, one of America’s wealthiest families and owners of the Hyatt hotel chain, Pritzker has long been involved in politics — most notably through her close connections to former President Barack Obama. She is one of the newest members of the Corporation, having assumed her role in July 2018.
Pritzker did not respond to a request for comment.
Paul Finnegan — the University Treasurer, who also sits on the Corporation — has given $226,650 to Republicans and $169,774 to Democrats since 1990. Finnegan wrote in an emailed statement that he considers himself an independent.
Finnegan, a Chicago-based investor, has also been “an enthusiastic supporter” of Democratic Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel since his 2015 campaign, he wrote. He contributed $100,000 to the mayor’s campaign fund that year, a sum not included in Corporation-wide totals because it was a local election.
Other notable donors on the Corporation include lawyer Theodore V. Wells, Jr. — who has given more than half a million dollars to Democrats since 1990 — and Corporation Senior Fellow William F. Lee ’72, who has donated $148,600 to Democrats since 1994.
Wells and Lee have given $1,500 and $6,000 to Republicans since 1990, respectively. Lee also gave $2,700 to an independent candidate in 2017.
Kenneth I. Chenault and Karen Gordon Mills ’75 have also each given more than $100,000 to Democrats since 1990.
Wells, Lee, Chenault, and Mills did not respond to requests for comment.
University of California, Berkeley Professor Susan L. Graham ’64 is the only member of the Corporation who has not donated any money to political campaigns or organizations since 1990.
The Corporation is not only tied to Democratic candidates through members’ donations, however. Several members have also served in Democratic White Houses.
Private equity executive David M. Rubenstein worked for former President Jimmy Carter in the 1970s. He joined Carter’s presidential campaign in 1976 and served as a deputy to domestic policy adviser Stuart Eizenstat during Carter’s first and only term. After Carter failed to win a second-term, Rubenstein left politics for the corporate world.
All other members who have worked in federal politics did so in the Obama administration.
Penny Pritzker served as the U.S. Secretary of Commerce from 2013 to 2017 after co-chairing Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign. A native Chicagoan, Pritzker had long-standing ties to Obama, who she has known since the 1990s when he and his in-laws would frequent her Lake Michigan lakehouse.
Karen Gordon Mills also worked the Obama White House, serving as the 23rd U.S. Small Business Administrator from 2009 to 2013 — which Obama elevated to a Cabinet-level post in 2012.
Theodore Wells also has ties to presidential campaigns. In 2000, he served as Democrat Bill Bradley’s National Campaign Treasurer during his unsuccessful run.
Jessica Tuchman Mathews ’67 has not worked in the White House, but she confirmed in an email that she is a Democrat and a “strong” critic of Trump.
“I am indeed a Democrat and a strong critic in print and in person of President Trump from 2015,” she wrote.
“In this most polarized political environment ever, Harvard has made a conscious effort (which the Corporation has been aware of and in strong support of) to debate issues from all political viewpoints, invite speakers reflecting that, and made a particular effort to create and support bipartisan projects where the subject matter is appropriate,” Matthews added.
In 1961, William F. Buckley, a conservative commentator and author, famously said, “I would rather be governed by the first 2000 people in the Boston telephone directory than by the 2000 people on the faculty of Harvard University."
Multiple higher education experts pointed to this quip in addressing the perception that elite institutions like Harvard are havens for liberal thinking. Higher education in general has faced a hostile political climate in recent years, with Republicans questioning the merits of universities and at times, promoting and passing policies that negatively impact them.
David A. Hopkins ’99, a political science professor at Boston College, said contemporary politics as they relate to higher education are undergoing a shift. More Republican support now comes from those without four year college degrees than in previous political eras, according to Hopkins.
“Academia in general is going to be drawn more and more into a partisan debate where it's identified really with the Democratic party and not the Republican party,” Hopkins said.
“Every major university has to face the fact that its constituents are more and more in one party and not the other,” Hopkins added. “I think that's a very important change in our politics and I think its implications for universities [are] potentially quite significant.”
In addition to Corporation members, Harvard faculty, instructors, and researchers have contributed overwhelmingly to federal Democratic campaigns and political organizations, according to a 2015 Crimson analysis of Federal Election Commission filings. A 2018 Crimson survey of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences revealed that the vast majority of respondents identified as “liberal” or “very liberal,” with a similarly large majority having voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
For Frederick M. Hess, an education expert with the American Enterprise Institute, the Corporation’s alignment with professors’ trends “reaffirms” his belief that Harvard is not ideologically neutral.
“When we see what we already know, which is that leadership at a place like Harvard is highly partisan, that makes it harder to make the case that you're rising above partisan divides,” Hess said.
In an emailed statement, University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain pointed to Bacow’s installation address where Bacow “clearly conveys his and the University’s commitment to embracing ideological diversity and perspectives are welcomed across the Harvard community.”
Swain also noted that the University has invited a “breadth of speakers from across the political and ideological spectrum” in recent years to speak at Harvard, including U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, Senator Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s and women’s squash teams ended their seasons this past weekend with two College Squash Association Individual National Championships. Freshman Victor Crouin and junior Gina Kennedy both won their respective Men’s and Women’s Division A tournaments.
“It is a testament to the coaching staff,” sophomore Sam Scherl said. “It really comes down to the coaches and the captains, and it is incredibly rewarding and exciting to be a part of a program that’s experiencing such success.”
Four players from each team were in the top draw of the tournament, a demonstration of how dominant the Harvard teams have been this past season. Since Harvard had four out of the sixteen players in each tournament, there were realistic hopes that a Harvard player would bring a trophy home.
“There was definitely hope a Harvard player would take it all home, but because we are all so evenly matched, anyone could have won the title,” Gina Kennedy said. “It was a serious challenge and super exciting to have both Harvard players bring it home.”
Kennedy was the third seed of her draw. In the opening match, she beat Trinity’s Salma T. Alam Eldin in a fairly decisive 3-0 match. She unfortunately faced her teammate, Amelia Henley, in the second round. Kennedy remained steady and focused, as she was able to pull out another 3-0 victory. The semifinal match was against Penn’s Reeham Sedky. After falling in the first game, 11-9, Kennedy retained her composure and won the following three games, defeating her opponent 3-1.
“I was elated because I was really not expecting to win that match,” said Kennedy. “On paper, the semifinal match was the most difficult match for me, so I didn’t want to put in all that effort into that match and then not win the finals.”
Gina was able to successfully use the impressive win in the semifinals as motivation in her final match.
“I just did my best to stay calm and not get too excited about potentially bringing it all home,” Kennedy said. “I knew it was such a good opportunity for me to take home the title after winning the semis, but it was going to be such a challenging match, so I was really just trying to stay focused.”
Just moments before Kennedy took her court in what would result in her second Ramsey Cup, teammate Victor Crouin exited his court with his first Pool Trophy.
“In my final match I was playing against the number one player from St. Lawrence. I knew I had to play my best; he’s one of the best juniors for his age,” Crouin said. “But during the match, I was relaxed and calm and in a good state of mind. I didn’t give him any opportunities to get a strong lead.”
Crouin won the Pool Trophy incredibly decisively. He dominated the competition, winning all four matches 3-0.
“It definitely was not obvious I was going to win, especially since during the season I lost to the number one and the number four seed,” Crouin said. “But I really just enjoyed my time playing of course, and was able to bring it all home.”
The convenient location of the tournament at Brown University was particularly helpful for both players, as they were able to be physically supported by their all of their teammates.
“Everyone who wasn’t in the tournament, men and women, all traveled to Brown to watch both of us play,” Kennedy said. “It was just really amazing to share it with everyone.”
For both players, it was the support of their teammates that really made their victories special.
“I just was so happy because everyone on the team came up from Harvard to watch,” Crouin said. “I felt so fortunate to have everyone behind me.”

FRIDAY, MARCH 8
Brown at Princeton, 4:00 PM, ESPNU.
This game has major implications for the fourth and final spot in Ivy Madness next weekend, as Brown and Penn enter the final week of play with hopes of booking their ticket to New Haven. A Brown victory over Princeton on Friday night, coupled with a Yale victory at Penn, would seal a playoff spot for the Bears. In a senior season mired with controversy, Princeton’s Devin Cannady has announced the conclusion of his collegiate career, and has taken a leave of absence for the school.
With Brown seeing Friday night as a must-win game for their chances, and the Tigers solidly in third place in the standings, I see the more desperate team coming out firing Friday afternoon, regardless of home court advantage. I like to Brown to play with fire and win a close game behind sophomore star Desmond Cambridge, after beating Princeton by eight at home earlier in the season.
The Pick: Brown by 2 or more.
Yale at Penn, 7:00pm.
The second Friday night game with significant playoff implications will be played at the Palestra in Philadelphia. Regardless of the outcome of the Brown - Princeton game being played earlier Friday afternoon, if Penn can beat Yale at home, it will guarantee itself a head-to-head with Brown in Philly Saturday night for all of the marbles. That being said, if the Bears knock off Princeton, Penn will be playing Yale with its playoff chances hanging by a thread, with a loss ending its season. The Quakers boast a legitimate Ancient Eight player of the year candidate in AJ Brodeur, who averages over 17 points and eight rebounds per game.
The Bulldogs have been scuffling as of late, losing two of its last three contests, including an eight-point home loss to upstart Columbia. Nevertheless, Yale will surely have plenty of motivation, looking to knock Harvard off of its first-place perch in the league. It’s hard to disagree that the Bulldogs are the more talented team, but in an Ivy League season characterized by twists and turns - none more surprising than a Penn team that knocked off Villanova battling late in the season for a spot in the top four - it’s simply too difficult to pick against the team facing a must-win situation. Ultimately, my pick for this game relies upon the earlier afternoon game, since Penn will enter the 7pm tip-off knowing the result of the Brown - Princeton game.
The Pick: Penn by 3 or more (or Yale by 3 or more if Princeton wins earlier).
Harvard at Cornell, 7:00pm.
This is a tough game to pick. Despite the Crimson’s loss to the Big Red at Lavietes Pavilion this season, the only Ivy League home loss for Harvard this season, the visitors enter this game as the far more complete, and hot team. The Crimson can likely chalk up that loss to the triple-overtime game against Columbia the night before, and will have revenge on their minds in Ithaca. That being said, Cornell’s season depends on Friday night’s game. If the Big Red can knock off the Crimson, they will stay in contention for Ivy Madness, although their chances of qualifying currently stand at 10 percent.
While I would normally be compelled to pick the more desperate, home team, Harvard is simply too talented, and Cornell has been scuffling in a big way. The Big Red has lost five games in a row, and although I expect the spread to be set at a small number, I expect the Crimson to rout Cornell on the road. Registering the worst offense in the Ivy League, and the third-worst defense in the conference simply won’t get it done against a first-place Harvard team.
The Pick: Harvard by 4 or more.
Dartmouth at Columbia, 7:00pm.
The only game of the weekend that is guaranteed to lack playoff implications, the two cellar-dwellers of the league will play Friday night in Morningside Heights. The Lions have solidified themselves as the spoilers of the Ancient Eight, knocking off both Brown and Yale last weekend on the road. Columbia has been tough behind the shooting of Gabe Stefanini and Quinton Adlesh, and are a couple close losses out of being firmly entrenched in the conversation for Ivy Madness.
The wheels have clearly come off the bus for Dartmouth, losers of six straight. I see them entering the final weekend of the season listless, against a far hotter Lions’ team. Columbia should be able to handle the Big Green with little trouble in front of a home crowd.
The Pick: Columbia by 5 or more.

SATURDAY, MARCH 9
Brown at Penn, 6:00pm.
This is, for all intents and purposes, the biggest game of the weekend. Barring a Brown win coupled with a Penn loss on Friday night, this matchup will determine the fourth spot in Ivy Madness. In a season that has tormented the Quakers in conference play, I don’t see Penn squandering yet another chance. If they enter Saturday night in a “win and in” situation, I can’t imagine a Quakers team, which is in all likelihood more talented than the Bears, losing at the Palestra. Expect Penn to handle Brown, and quite possibly punch their ticket to Ivy Madness.
The Pick: Penn by 4 or more.
Yale at Princeton, 6:00pm.
The Bulldogs might still be in the mix for the No. 1 seed in the league, which would guarantee them a trip to the NIT if they were to fall short of winning the tournament. The Tigers will in all likelihood be firmly entrenched in the No. 3 spot, giving them relatively little to play for, even on Senior Night at Jadwin Gymnasium.
Yale boasts the best offense in the conference at over 80 points per game, and I don’t see a Cannady-less Princeton keeping up with the visitors, despite the emergence of Ryan Schwieger. I like the Bulldogs to end the season in a winning way, before returning home to host Ivy Madness
The Pick: Yale by 6 or more.
Harvard at Columbia, 7:00pm.
The fact of the matter is, the Lions have never been an easy opponent for the Crimson to handle. The two teams played the hands-down most entertaining game of the season in Cambridge, when the Crimson eked out a 3-OT win. Expect Columbia to come out firing on senior night, with the confidence of knowing they have beaten Harvard three straight times at Levien Gymnasium.
With the Crimson hoping to hold onto the No. 1 seed in the league, expect a tightly fought contest. Despite having little to play for, I could see the Lions defending their home court and avenging their loss earlier in the season.
The Pick: Columbia by 2 or more.

Dartmouth at Cornell, 7:00pm.
I expect Cornell’s season to have already ended by this point, giving the Big Red little to play for. Senior Night will mark a well-deserved moment of recognition for Cornell’s standout Matt Morgan, one of the best players in recent memory to play in the Ivy League.
This one could honestly go either way, but I expect Dartmouth to put up little resistance as Morgan and the Big Red will take out their frustrations at missing the Ivy Tournament on the visitors.
The Pick: Cornell by 5 or more.

There are two kinds of people walking around on campus: those who live in Pforzheimer House, and those oblivious to how great it is. Pfhomies spend their three years as upperclassmen basking in a paradise of singles, “pf” puns, and enviable amenities (namely, a guinea pig room and a spfa). Home is where the heart is, and if your heart is drawn to things like dog-sledding trips and Adams dhall swipe, you should start hoping for Pfoho. 
The expansiveness of the Quad translates to luxurious housing options for its students. “We basically guarantee people singles sophomore year,” says Francisco “Frankie” Matos ’20, House Committee co-chair. “90 percent of people in Pfoho will get at least n housing sophomore year, if not n + 1. Other houses can’t guarantee that, even for juniors.”
Pfoho sophomores enter a lottery for housing preferences once they join the house, then rank the rooms they are interested in after receiving their lottery numbers. Besides hallway singles and typical suites (with singles!), sophomores are eligible for some fancier n+1 housing options, too, like rooms in the Jordans and duplexes — two-floor suites with ensuite bathrooms — for the luckiest blocking groups. The Jordans are a minute away from Pfoho’s main complex and offer spacious common rooms and kitchens.
Besides student rooms, Pforzheimer is full of other spaces to relax in. A Spfa in Holmes Hall boasts massage chairs, sunlight machines, and candles. Residents who miss their pets can visit Pfiona, Pfoebe, Piper, Penny, Maizy, Mochi, and Alpfalpfa, Pfoho’s guinea pigs, in the Holmes playroom. And when inspiration strikes, head to Pfoho’s art studio. Other spots to hang out include the Quad Grille, Junior Common Room, and dhall.
The dhall is where Pfoho’s warm and welcoming community really shines through. Students gather to eat, socialize, work, and procrastinate together at all hours of the day. “You know everyone in the dhall, everyone talks, they’re friendly, they say hi. Or everybody’s working together,” says Cade Palmer ’20, House Committee co-chair and former Crimson Sports Chair. Pforzheimer’s dhall has a unique two-story layout with long tables on the first floor and smaller ones on the second.
Leslie C. Ramos ’19 says the layout of the the dining hall is such that “people can be very social, but also kind of work when they don’t want to be social. It doesn’t sound like a big deal, but I think it makes a huge difference. A lot of people hang out here.”
Pfoho residents can enjoy dinner in their own dhall, but luckily don’t need to worry about trekking back to the Quad to get lunch between classes. Because of a long-past Pfoho-Adams rivalry featuring football, tug-of-war, and musical theater competition where Pfoho emerged victorious, all Pforzheimer students have swipe at Adams dhall (which normally has restrictions on interhouse lunch).Harvard University Dining Services swiper Anabela A. Pappas said Pforzheimer feels very homey.
“I don’t see it as a university here, working for a university. I see it as a home, or a family,” she said. “Sometimes I’m walking down the street and I’ll say ‘Oh! That’s one of my kids,’ you know? And people say, ‘You have kids?’ And I go, ‘No, no, no, you don’t understand, that’s my kid.’”
Frequent House events also help facilitate bonding. Faculty Deans Anne Harrington and John Durant hold open houses and hygges (donut-and-apple-cider events are named after a Norwegian word for comfort) to spend time with students. Pfoho also goes on exciting outings, which recently included dog-sledding in Maine, horseback riding, snow tubing, and whitewater rafting.
We talked to the HoCo chairs to get more on the inside scoop on what Pfoho is really like:
How would you describe the community here?
FM: When we go back to Pfoho, it’s kind of like we’re going home. We kind of have a separate life of, like, we do stuff at Harvard, which is at the Yard, stuff like that, then we go back to the Quad. It’s like we’re going back to our pfamily.
What should first-years look forward to on Housing Day?
CP: We have, like, 10 polar bears. Like, people dress up as polar bears and they squad up in the yard.
FM: We literally have 10 polar bears. We are not joking. We have 10. Every other House usually has one suit...Pfoho is one of the only houses able to, like, show up and show out on Housing Day, so we have all 10 polar bears rolling out.

Wait, so you’re telling me that it’s possible to have spacious singles, the best food on campus, and an amazing community… all in one house? Yep, Currierites truly have it all, so forget what you’ve heard about being quadded — everyone else is just jealous.
You may have been told “Dear sophomores, please don’t expect singles...” False! If you get Currier (lucky for you) it’s safe to enter the Housing process with this expectation. Typical sophomore housing involves a single connected to another single by a sink, or, in a few special cases, a suite with a full bathroom or kitchen. Currier also has the famous “Ten Man” — a suite and popular social space with ten singles surrounding the largest private common room on campus.
The physical layout of the House lends itself to a tight-knit community, with four towers (including Daniels, where most sophomores live) converging at the dining hall. With the center of the dhall occupied by a running water fountain, House Committee co-chair Austin J. Lentsch ’20 agrees with his fellow co-chair Jorge Campos ’21 when Campos says Currier “feels like a resort.”
One of the many common spaces includes the Fishbowl, a theater-like setup which hosts movie screenings, TV-show binge sessions, and recently a huge Super Bowl watch party. A quick walk through Currier will also reveal games galore, with air hockey, pool, and foosball tables just outside of the dhall. For your wilder side, the ever-popular Treehouse remains one of Harvard’s most prized party spots. Additionally, Currier recently added a “Makerspace” to its long list of amenities. It’s a room equipped with sewing machines, 3D printing equipment, and painting easels that would make any artist drool. If you’re less into making and more into shaking it, Currier also has a dance studio. And if art isn’t your thing generally, we have a feeling that some combination of the Currier Fitness Suite, the massage room, and the massive selection of kitchens will suffice.
If there’s one thing to remember about Currier, it’s the community. Though the sheer amount of singles would seem to be isolating, the small population, casual vibe, and close relationships with Faculty Deans Sylvia Barrett ’94 and Latanya Sweeney ’95 as well as the House administrators create a wonderful community. In fact, Campos describes having the “opposite problem of buy-in,” where Currier’s house spirit leads to over-attendance (rather than under-attendance) at their events. The overall sense of inclusivity is also affirmed by the students; Yanet D. Gomez ’19 describes the House as “friendly, welcoming, and a truly special community,” and adds that inclusivity is rooted in Currier’s history, being the only House with buildings all named after female alumni.
Another plus of the home-feel of Currier? Establishing a “work-life balance,” Lentsch says. The House’s proximity to a variety of coffee shops as well as Porter Square allows for an abundance of study space options. Or, if you’re in need of a break, the gigantic climbing wall in the Quadrangle Recreational Athletic Center down the street should do the trick!
Perhaps the best display of the Currier community is found in its fun House traditions, where Currierites can be found belting it out at the annual Currioke, celebrating Halloween at their Heaven and Hell dance, or tuning in for a night of Currier cinema. Granted, this House doesn’t need an event to bring people together. Currier dhall is the place to be at all hours of the day, described by Sarah Zeng ’21 as “a relaxed environment where students can come down in pajamas and feel right at home.” Non-Currierites can be found hanging (and wishing they lived in Currier) in the dhall at all times — Lentsch remembers eating almost exclusively at Currier following Housing Day his first year because of the amazing food. See ya never, Berg!
We talked to the HoCo chairs to get the inside scoop on what Currier is really like:
Any special amenities, besides the many already mentioned?
JC: Solariums! Three of the four towers have balconies that oversee the area within party spaces, so access to those is in high demand.
What’s the backstory behind those...rubber ducks...on the dining hall fountain?
JC: For a while, we had a giant rubber duck at the center of the dining hall.
AL: It was hype, we crowdsourced it.
Finally, what would you say about the walk to the Quad?
AL: You learn how to walk fast. Plus, we don’t have that slope you have to struggle with walking to the river Houses…I get to choose leg day.

The love Cabotians have for their house is palpable; they gush about all things related to space (physical, social, and mental), and love their community. Cabot boasts singles as large as freshmen common rooms, designated party spaces (*cough* *cough* the Aquarium), and an inviting atmosphere that will make you feel at home. 
If space is what you’re after, Cabot is the perfect place for you. House Committee Co-Chairs and blockmates Ashish Dahal ’20 and Ian V. M. Saum ’20 say that they got n+1 suites with a large common room and singles for all their roommates as sophomores. Now as juniors, with admittedly subpar housing lottery numbers, Saum bought a queen-sized bed for his room and Dahal has enough space in his room to do morning yoga!
Sophomores in Cabot can indicate preference for a single or a suite, with suites ranging from doubles to sextets. Cabot has beds for 363 students (making it one of the smaller Houses, which only adds to the community feeling) with 120 singles available. Cabot surrounds the Quad Lawn (which is often full of cute dogs!), and fortunately, most of its buildings are connected through tunnels (save for the Islands), so you can walk to breakfast in your PJs, even in the dead of winter.
Cabot boasts amazing amenities: From a pottery studio, to a dance studio, game room, and a cafe that’s open until 1 a.m. on most nights, this House really has so much to offer. Saum even says, “If you’re interested in actual lifting, our gym is by far better than any other House gym. I will stand by that. That is a hill I will die on.”
According to the HoCo chairs, Cabot has the highest piano to student ratio, showing how Cabot really allows students to explore their interests. From an annual musical in which many of the participating students are new to theater, to the official meme group “Cabot House Memes for Fishy Teens” (with an official HoCo Meme Chief), Cabot prides itself on having the real CEB — the Cabot Events Board.
“I’m almost a fanatic when I tell people about [Cabot]. Cabot is awesome,” says Stephanie Zhao ’21.
Cabot is almost synonymous with community, and though that may be cliche, Cabot administration really does the most to provide its students with a sense of belonging.
Festivus, Cabot’s annual winter holiday party, involves Food (take-out from all different types of cuisine), Feats (a talent show of sorts), and Fire (the burning of Grievances). The Fire part of Festivus is especially fun. Who doesn’t want to literally burn their complaints to stomp out negative energy? Each year, Cabot also holds a Dutch Auction, where “random” things are auctioned off as a fundraiser for HoCo. You can pay to have people pied in the face, or, in the case of Dahal, be hired to juggle in the dhall for an hour.
Cabot is one of the only upperclassmen Houses that organizes weekly entryway study breaks — 9 p.m. on Sundays. Don’t miss it! Colloquially referred to as the “milk and cookies fund,” Cabot has money set aside specifically for this purpose. This really fosters close relationships between students and tutors and gives students a time to de-stress. The House administration, which includes Faculty Deans Stephanie R. Khurana and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, “helps you make your dreams a reality,” according to the HoCo Chairs. With the installation of “Cabot Sharing” held each Sunday in the dhall, members of the Cabot community have a platform to say “whatever [they] want,” expressing their thoughts, feelings, and general ideas.
Zhao goes on to say that Cabot also throws coffeehouses (called codfeehouses) in which are open mics where people can share their poetry or sing. Zhao says, “It’s so amazing; we had a holiday sing-along last semester and two of my friends shared their poetry. It was so good and such a wholesome moment. We were just piled up on the couch, and I was like this is ‘this is truly one of the happiest moments of my life.’” Saum agreed, and went on to add, “That’s me every night.”
Thought Cabot couldn’t possibly have more community-oriented events? Wrong. Cabot hosts “Formal Hall” each month, which gives students the chance to get dressed up and hang out in the Senior Common Room with their friends and peers. Each month there’s a different theme, ranging from a murder mystery, “Jeopardy!,” or a White Elephant gift swapping event.
Cabot truly prides themselves on having “one of the strongest communities,” according to Dahal. From currently ranking first in the Quad for intramurals, to allowing students countless opportunities to express themselves, Cabot is a House that anyone can call home.
We talked to the HoCo chairs to get the inside scoop on what Cabot is really like:
Describe Cabot in three words. 
AD: Always our home. That’s the biggest thing to take away — feels like home.
IVMS: It’s like a coming-of-age 80’s film.
What’s one thing you want freshmen to know about Cabot? About the Quad?
AD: There seems to be a stigma about the Quad. And honestly it comes from years of just institutionally segregating the Quad from the rest of Harvard. But, it’s not that far. From the Yard it’s .7 miles — the same distance from [Cabot] to the Science Center as Dunster. I leave here at 8:50 and get to my classes at 9:00 on time.
IVMS: The shuttle’s frequent. The walk’s not that far. The House is amazing.
Ok. I have to ask, is the SOCH actually used? 
IVMS: Actually, there’s a group of Cabot tutors that started a weekly Bachelor watch party in the SOCH, so we are bringing the SOCH back on the map. So if you’re into “The Bachelor,” Cabot is the House for you.
What superheroes are your faculty deans most similar to?
AD and IVMS: The Incredibles. Mr. and Mrs. Incredible.
If you had to compare your house to a fruit, what would it be and why? 
IVMS: Fruit salad because we have a little bit of everything.
AD: I don’t want to say something generic like pineapple because we’re so much more than that.
IVMS: Part of me wants to say grapes, because that’s my favorite fruit and Cabot is my favorite House. What’s the best fruit? Whatever the best fruit is. Bananas, because we have layers?
Correction: Mar. 7, 2019
The original version of this article called residents of Cabot "Cabotites." They are in fact known as Cabotians.
