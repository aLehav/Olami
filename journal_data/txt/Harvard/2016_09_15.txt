After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hold onto your hats, because I’m starting this column with a bombshell.
Donald Trump is not connecting with black Americans.
Now, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. After all, this is a man who has a “great relationship with the blacks” and would be reelected with “95 percent of the black vote.” In fact, Rudy Giuliani argues he might outperform every modern Republican in the demographic. (That one’s technically true, as Nate Cohn notes, because the election hasn’t happened yet.)
You already know where I’m going with this. In the non-Trumpian reality, for whatever it’s worth, Trump is polling very poorly among black Americans. By FiveThirtyEight’s count last month, he’s in fourth place. His recent appeals to the demographic have prompted offense and scorn, and deservedly: Trump is giving these speeches to overwhelmingly white audiences while doubling down on dog-whistle politics. And even an uncharacteristically pitch-perfect entreaty would only work if blacks forgot Trump’s career-long history of discrimination towards blacks and winking sympathy towards white nationalists.
So the pivot probably won’t work. (Sorry, Rudy.) But a phrase at the heart of Trump’s message to black voters—and the reaction to it—reveals a fascinating insight about how we think about politics. After rattling off a list of Black America’s problems, Trump asks, “What the hell do you have to lose?”
This is essentially the same pitch Trump makes to whites. Trump embraces, even exaggerates, how wildly different he is from other politicians. Since we all hate them so much (the thinking goes), why not give an outsider a chance? This idea won Trump a plurality of the Republican primary vote. It’s actually winning him a plurality of white voters in the general election, too. If Trump weren’t, well, Trump—that is, if another candidate, without his numerous racial miscues, tried this “Why not?” strategy—would it work with blacks?
I don’t think so, because of a psychological concept called gain-loss asymmetry. When we feel we’ve gained something, we’re reluctant to gamble it away; when we feel we’ve lost something, we’re willing to risk a considerable amount to get it back.
Black Americans are far more optimistic about the country’s trajectory than whites. Black voters over 65, who vote more than anyone else, are old enough to remember times before the Civil Rights Act, Voting Rights Act, and Fair Housing Act (the latter of which gave Trump his first brush with infamy). The rest at least remember a time when all American presidents had been white. Many will hear Trump’s question, think of the incremental-change model beloved by President Obama—to whom they give an approval rating in the 90s—and answer, “Everything.”
The white working class, though, feels that they’ve lost, “bigly.” Facing stagnant wages, decreasing lifespans, and shrinking political clout, they’ve largely grown pessimistic about the future, and Trump’s bleak take on the nation’s future matches their own. Maybe Trump’s message resonates with these voters because they see their livelihoods drifting away and are willing to roll the dice to get them back.
The gain-loss asymmetry framework helps explain how Trump fares among other demographics. Bisexual, gay, and lesbian Americans, who in their lifetimes have witnessed a stunning reversal of public opinion and equal treatment under the law, have especially good reason to distrust a candidate whose very slogan promises a return to the past. Sure enough, a poll released in May found that BGLT voters preferred Clinton to Trump by an even greater margin than they preferred their 2012 counterparts, even though Trump’s rhetoric on same-sex marriage and gender-neutral bathrooms are to the left of Romney’s.
The same framework also helps us reckon with Trump’s success. He presents himself as a wild card, a long-shot solution to revitalizing the American Dream. I imagine that a large number of third-party voters and even of Trump’s supporters think, “Sure, this guy could turn out to be a real disaster, but he couldn’t be worse than what we have.”
Such thinking, though, betrays a lack of imagination. Donald Trump could definitely be worse than what we have—or what we’ve ever had. That Trump is a stumble away from the presidency represents a failure on the part of the Republican Party and the horse-race-obsessed, false-equivalence-prone media. Whomever you consider to be the most destructive president in our history—W., Carter, Obama, whoever you’d like—still, inarguably, had guardrails to prevent him from doing anything truly cataclysmic. But those guardrails, like normal dispositions, mostly competent advisors, and a willingness to rule out first use of nuclear weapons, are not intrinsic to the office. A President Trump could, for example, launch nuclear weapons, still the most serious (and most strangely overlooked) threat to humanity, with little deliberation.
Risk is thrilling. If you feel like our country’s not as great as it used to be, you might feel like taking a gamble. But America risks throwing away a whole lot more than a few bucks at a failing Atlantic City casino.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the new academic year in full swing, enrollment numbers are in, and Professor N. Gregory Mankiw’s Economics 10a: "Principles of Economics" has surpassed CS50 in undergraduate enrollment. This consistently popular course, however, comes with a caveat this fall.
Mankiw has required all students to purchase a copy of his textbook from the Harvard Coop in order to access an online service for submitting problem sets and online quizzes—a stipulation that will cost each student who enrolls $130.
Because the paid online service is the exclusive system for students to submit quizzes and assignments, buying or renting course materials that are anything but brand new is no longer a possibility. Without the online access codes, students are not able to complete course requirements, and the possibility of successfully finishing the course rests simply on the ability to purchase the textbook.
This change to Ec10 represents part of a corporatization of education, where the sharing of knowledge has become another business opportunity, and maximizing profits come above the will to foster open intellectual discourse. Given the price of college tuition, academic publishing should not be making excessive profits on the backs of students who already suffer from crippling debt. The effects of these tendencies occasionally border on the absurd. Ec10’s decision to use a new online platform, for example, fabricates a nonexistent need in order to justify the purchase of unnecessarily expensive software. A multitude of different online programs are already provided for free by the University—Canvas, for instance—where students can submit online assignments.
Thus, this shift in policy is antithetical to the fundamental ideals of a liberal arts education. As an institution, Harvard strives to maximize access to education and make barriers of entry as low as possible, providing each student with the intellectual freedom to explore their interests. By putting a minimum $130 sticker price on an introductory economics course, Ec10 prevents low-income students from accessing the Economics Department and stifles their interest in a potential concentration in economics. As evidenced by enrollment, most students can most likely scrape together the requisite sum, but it is still a large enough disincentive to send some students reeling.
Worse, students’ decisions whether or not to enroll in Ec10 may affect students for the remainder of their adult lives. Economics classes are Harvard's most common entry point to business and finance worlds that already lack diversity. Bottlenecking access to an education in economics only exacerbates this issue, creating an ironic positive feedback loop: Only students who come from relatively prosperous financial backgrounds can comfortably access the education that will prepare them for the most lucrative post-graduate opportunities.
But if making the Economics Department less accessible were not enough, the problem is furthered by the fact that Ec10 is a concentration requirement for other concentrations in the social sciences. This decision has far-reaching effects that go beyond the confines of one course, and in effect places a sticker price on those concentrations too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This summer, I led a double life. In one of my realities, I reported to the offices of an academic publication in New York City’s SoHo wearing jeans and sneakers. But each day, when the clock struck three, I pulled a reverse-Cinderella and transformed into the glamorous hostess of an upscale Italian restaurant.
The costume change I underwent was certainly symbolic. One job had me researching ancient Hindu legal texts, the other had me opening menus for wealthy lawyers. One set of bosses didn’t care what I looked like; the others would send me home to change if they didn’t like my shoes. While I earned my editorial internship by navigating a challenging application process, I procured my restaurant job by walking up to the general manager and telling him that if he wanted a hard-working hostess, he should hire me. So he did.
But despite their superficial differences, I’d like to set something straight: One was not “better”—more impressive, productive, or interesting—than the other. And yet, I’m finding that when prospective employers and even friends ask me about what I did this summer, I know which job they want to hear about: the white-collar one rather than the blue.
To be fair, the list of resume-worthy skills I picked up at my internship sparkles. I learned how to craft a publicity report using an array of analytical tools. If you asked me to spearhead the next issue’s publicity campaign, I could upload the right articles and send the appropriate emails with confidence and style. Someday, when I found a fashion journal, I’ll know how to operate its publication and measure its success.
I also practiced and honed skills that are harder to quantify, like how to meticulously fact-check essays or skim entire book chapters in mere minutes. By the end of my summer, I was assigned to propose my own edits in the margins of our distinguished writers’ essays.
I’ll admit that working in a restaurant didn’t necessarily equip me with equivalent technical skills. But I grate when people assume that I learned nothing valuable in my time as a hostess.
If my internship gave me the skills I need to apply for prestigious posts, my restaurant job taught me what kind of person I want to be once I’m there. My boss—the restaurant’s general manager—held his employees to an extremely high standard of punctuality and accountability. In my two months there, I watched two different girls get hired and quickly fired for arriving late to work. On Harvard Time, neither would have been tardy.
On another evening, he asked our highest selling waitress to leave immediately, because she’d made one too many mistakes dealing with customers. My boss didn’t enjoy making these kinds of rash staff cuts, but later, he’d take me aside and impress upon me the importance of ruthless perfectionism in doing business.
Beyond presenting me with real consequences for tardiness, honing my attention to detail, and teaching me how to multitask, my restaurant job trained me to treat everyone I met with respect worthy of the queen. And though I know as well as the next person that you shouldn’t judge people by their appearances, I noticed that everyone—including myself—does this anyway without realizing it.
In the worlds of finance, modeling, and big business—where most of our clients worked—it’s easy to assume that those who act important and dress expensively are the wealthiest and therefore most worthy of our attention. Often, they were. But other times, the most unassuming couple turned out to be a wine connoisseur and truffle fanatic. In these instances, we wasted time catering to more demanding, entitled customers while the real VIP sat two tables away, gearing up to spend several hundred dollars on lunch without a waiter to take her order.
The stereotyping was mutual. Whereas I spent my mornings sending edits to Ph.D.s from my Harvard College email address, doctors and lawyers condescended to Hostess Lily in the evenings. “What about schooling?” a couple of Ivy Leaguers once asked me. “Have you ever considered pursuing any?” I could see customers’ eyes refocusing, seeing me for the first time when I told them I study at Harvard.
Later, I’d realize that the other employees were never offered similar opportunities to explain themselves. I’d wonder why customers asked me these questions but not the others. Because I look young? Innocent? Because I don’t speak English with an accent?
I thought it unfair that no one knew about the bread server’s master’s in philosophy. I wanted to publicly broadcast that the manager could speak five languages fluently—that everywhere you turned, blue-collar workers boasted white-collar skills.
But this exercise missed the mark completely. A blue-collar job is a tiring, immense amount of work in its own right, one that is worthy of the utmost respect. Blue-collar workers don’t become validated by their white-collar skills. And yet, I think we should consider the reverse more seriously.
Let’s champion the skills that blue-collar work develops. I’m glad I know how to use Google Analytics, but I’m proud that I picked up some Italian this summer. I’m happy that I can put coding experience on my resume, but I’m more interesting for knowing how to fillet a whole Branzino. Perhaps I’m a better candidate for future jobs because of my internship, but I’ll certainly be a more valuable employee—a humbler, harder worker—thanks to my restaurant training.

Daniel E. Lieberman ’86, Human Evolutionary Biology: One of my favorite memories is from my freshman seminar with Professor David Pilbeam in 1982. In order to estimate the brain size of an important fossil (Olduvai Hominid 7), I measured hundreds of skulls to try to come up with a regression equation that would predict the brain size of both chimpanzees and humans from the same set of measurements. The paper was due at the end of reading period, which back then was after the Christmas/New Year’s break. I took all the data home with me and spent pretty much my entire two-week vacation trying to derive an equation that worked, but I couldn’t. It ruined my vacation because I was sure I had failed and done something wrong. But when I brought the many reams of printouts to his office the first day of reading period in January, I remember he said: “Well of course, I thought that wouldn’t work!” For the record, we spent most of the next semester trying to find a solution, which eventually we did!
Harry R. Lewis ’68, Computer Science: Senior spring, my thesis and coursework all but finished, my Radcliffe sophomore girlfriend and I have gotten our initially horrified parents happy with the idea that we really are going to get married right after commencement. A precious USPHS commission will keep me out of Vietnam. But I still have one terrifying problem. I am enrolled in an independent study with Doris Aaronson in psychology, and with everything else going on in my life, I have done absolutely nothing for it. If I fail, I will not graduate. Everything—EVERYTHING!—will unravel catastrophically. I plaintively explain the high stakes to Doris. She agrees to pass me—provided that I return all the books she lent me three months earlier! I frantically search my room and finally find them all. Forty-eight years later, girlfriend and I are still married, and I hope I am paying forward my monumental debt by showing equal kindness to the students I teach today.
David J. Malan ’99, Computer Science: The year was 1996, and I was a sophomore shopping a course called CS50. I was a Gov concentrator at the time, and I wasn’t all that comfortable with the idea of taking a CS course, so I figured I’d take it pass/fail. It was the first lecture, and Professor Brian Kernighan was telling us how important it is to be precise when programming a computer, much like when trimming one’s beard. (A particularly long one he had.) In front of him were a few instruments, probably scissors and similarly reasonable options. But also some hedge clippers, electric and already plugged in. As I recall, we were to give him precise instructions for trimming his beard safely. 
Professor Kernighan ended up cutting his beard that day with hedge clippers.
Matt Saunders ’97, Visual and Environmental Studies: The middle 1990s was a time of transition in VES, and as a “studio” concentrator it could feel pretty Wild West.  Many classes had resident dogs or chain smoking or both, and I remember one course in which the TF and the puppy had the same name.  The former always visibly flinched whenever the cry rang out: “Susie! Don’t pee on the floor!” 
Times have changed, but that time didn’t seem too bad. The example of these practitioners, fully in their element, lit a fire in many of us.  That’s the moment I really tuned in and fiercely devoted every ounce of curiosity towards art.
Howard M. Georgi ’68, Physics: Probably my most memorable academic experience as a Harvard undergrad came when Julian Schwinger thanked me in class.  Schwinger, who shared the Nobel Prize with Feynman and Tomonaga in 1965, was an imperious lecturer who ignored questions and hurried out of the room at the end of class so his graduate students could not corner him.  But he had challenged the class to do an integral that he thought would be useful in his research.  I succeeded in doing it and put the result in his mailbox.  I was stunned the next week when he acknowledged me by name.

Weird, obsessive, over-the-top. Words that have been used to describe former Disney child stars, every guy who starts drumming on a Home Depot bucket in the subway, and several famous serial killers.
They’re also used to describe me.
Uh, but not like that—fret not, I have yet to overdose on prescription drugs, the only thing I’ve ever performed on public transit is emo slam poetry, and the closest I’ve gotten to going full Dahmer is listening to Maroon 5’s “Animals” on repeat while studying for midterms.
But I do hear words like that almost every time someone walks into my bedroom, which doubles as a shrine to Sam Smith. Guests enter, see the Sam Smith records hanging on the right-hand wall, and think, “Okay, cool.” Then they turn, see a massive framed poster of Sam Smith on the left-hand wall over my bed, and think, “This dude’s got issues.”
And they’re right: I have a bad knee, I’m lactose intolerant, and sometimes, I get nervous on airplanes.
But my obsession with Sam Smith—who, for the uninformed and uncultured, is the UK-born vocalist behind 2014’s multiple Grammy Award-winning album “In the Lonely Hour,” whom the heavens sent from above to grace mere mortals with his divine presence—is not one of them.
My one-sided love affair with Sam (I assume we’re on a first-name basis) began even before the full album was released—I remember the first time I heard his unmatched voice featured on Disclosure’s “Latch.” Ever since senior year of high school, I’ve listened to Sam’s music almost constantly, making him my most listened-to monthly artist on Spotify for over 30 straight months, and I even added him as my phone background to add a visual layer to the audio-centric obsession. Before my weeks-long search for the aforementioned poster came to fruition, I designed a custom one and was prepared to pay [number redacted] dollars to have it printed. In what was truly the pinnacle of my torrid fanaticism, one particularly lovely blockmate threw me a Sam Smith-themed 20th birthday party—complete with a Sam Smith party playlist curated by another lovely blockmate.
Which is not to say this obsession with Sam doesn’t create challenges for my life. It has led to me crashing my car in an ice storm on the way back from a life-changing concert and is why my Spotify playlist is almost never chosen for road trips with friends or family (unless I’m voted in as driver, which, because of example #1, I am not). It is also, I tell myself every day, the only reason that I’m single.
And then there are, as I mentioned, the Haters. The Haters seize on different aspects of my Sam Smith obsession to mock, and we must be wary, for the Haters take many forms: the fellow FM exec who refuses to come to my room because he “hates that poster”; the guest last weekend who knocked on my door, mocked the records on the wall, and then proceeded to ask me for advice on problems he was facing; the woman on Metro North who told me to turn down my music because she could “hear that shit from your headphones.”
What they don’t understand, and what they won’t understand, is that every line of “that shit”—and every falsetto, voice break, and croon that defines Sam Smith’s style—is, in my mind, connected to someone or something. I hear “Too much of a good thing, won’t be good for long,” and I see the heart I would’ve given anything not to break; I hear “I feel we’re close enough,” and I remember all the times we weren’t; and I hear “Drown all my shadows, drown them like before,” and I remember last May.
But Sam Smith’s music—despite a common misconception—isn’t just about the people or things who have hurt your heart: It’s also about those who have made it feel better. “Life Support,” to me, is about all the people who’ve been there for me when I needed them; “Nirvana” is about the people in my life who take me there every day; and “Latch” is about the people I clung to in the foam at Mather Lather.
The Haters don’t really think about such possibilities—not because they can’t, but because they don’t want to. If you really want to stump the Haters, ask them if they’ve ever considered whether I might have these personal, serious reasons for loving Sam.
I’ll spoil the answer: They haven’t.
Which is sad. Not because their words hurt me or upset me—I’ve heard them so many times before that at this point they’re boring—but because people who are, ostensibly, friends, feel compelled to belittle music that makes me happy, décor that makes my room homey, and an obsession that keeps me entertained—not because it affects them, but just because they feel like it.  And I’m not even one of those “Don’t judge, lest ye be judged” types—have you seen those people obsessed with eating plastic bags? For Christ’s sake, let’s focus on harassing them.
They say that the first step to healing is admitting you have a problem. Fortunately for me, I don’t think I do.
I say fortunately because after the important stuff—God, family, friends, school, country, and Corps—is all said and done, Sam Smith’s music is a part of my life I would never trade away or give up in order to silence the joking words or narrow the widened eyes. It has a message, a message that it’s okay to be sad, okay to be lonely, okay to not be okay. But it also says something more than that—that underneath all that hurt and that heartache, it’s important to hope and to love, because one day, some weird, obsessive, over-the-top kid is going to hang a poster of you in his room, and things are going to be a little bit better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dorm Crew has implemented a more generous pay schedule this fall and offered dinners during its pre-orientation program for the first time, following suggestions from an employee survey and criticisms in the College’s report on diversity and inclusion.
The changes are designed to appeal to incoming freshman and increase the program’s retention rate, according to Dorm Crew co-head captain Michael P. Dybala ’17.
“Our wage wasn’t as competitive as it was in the past. We raised the pay to both make it competitive and to raise the retention rate,” Dorm Crew co-head captain Ali A. Elreichouni ’17 said. “The flexibility of the job increases the opportunities of the students to take on other non-paying jobs they may not have been able to otherwise.”
Wages for Dorm Crew have increased dramatically. In the last academic year, and during this summer’s “Fall Clean-Up”—the session in August geared toward incoming freshmen—a Dorm Crew employee’s salary would begin at $13.25 per hour and increase only in small increments over many semesters, Dybala and Elreichouni said. Beginning this fall, hourly wages start at $16.25 and increase by a dollar by the end of the student’s first year on Dorm Crew. Captains can now earn up to $18.25 per hour.
Paul L. Belmonte ’10, Dorm Crew’s supervisor, said he hopes this will reverse the decline in Dorm Crew participation in the last few years.
“A lot of people would work for us for a few weeks and then fall off the face of the Earth,” he said.
The retention rate for freshmen who participated in Fall Clean-up was higher this year than in the past, a fact Belmonte partly attributed to the pay raise.
He also said the provision of dinner during the weeklong program made Dorm Crew more attractive to incoming freshmen, by giving them an opportunity to get to know one another outside of work.
“We tried to make more programming, more social activities in addition to the work day,” Belmonte said. “It comes back to building community.”
The free meals come after complaints cited in the College’s report on diversity and inclusion that students who chose Dorm Crew as their pre-orientation program in order to make money were then expected to pay for their own meals. While Annenberg was open during these sessions, meals there could cost freshmen as much as a quarter of their daily earnings, according to the report.
The Crimson’s survey of the current freshman class found that more than half of the incoming students who participated in Dorm Crew’s Fall Cleanup come from families with a combined income of less than $125,000. The lack of a meal plan during the pre-orientation program was especially difficult for those students who hoped to save money for the semester during the program rather than spend it.
Dorm Crew employees overall have been happy with the change, Belmonte said.
“I know from a captain’s perspective that everyone is really happy,” Dybala said. “General satisfaction has gone up. Everyone is just generally satisfied.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
American Sign Language instructor Andrew R. Bottoms was concerned that he would not have enough students to fill Linguistics 73a: “Beginning American Sign Language 1,” the first ASL class Harvard has offered in more than 20 years.
To his surprise, Bottoms estimated at least 70 students showed up on the first day to vie for the 15 spots available.
“I can’t even explain that feeling,” he said, through an interpreter, of having students overflowing the classroom and sitting on the floor and on top of desks. “I certainly knew American Sign Language was a class that was in high demand, but I was not expecting this.”
Various student and faculty efforts, including a 2014 Undergraduate Council referendum to support the campaign for ASL courses, culminated in Harvard’s announcement this summer that it would reintroduce ASL into its course offerings. The College chose Bottoms, an instructor in the deaf studies program at Boston University who is himself deaf, to teach a sequence of ASL courses in the fall and spring.
One usual motivation for language courses—the College’s language requirement—could not have been a reason for the course’s popularity, though. Faculty of Arts and Sciences policy does not allow ASL to fulfill the requirement, since the class does not have a written component.
“It’s something that I’m struggling with, because there is documentation that American Sign Language is a language,” Bottoms said. “I understand the want for measurement, the want for testing, the want for proof of learning. We have that. It’s just a different mode.”
Emily G. Davies ’18, the university initiatives coordinator for the student-run Committee on Deaf Awareness, advocated for the course and publicized it during shopping period. She said she is now petitioning Harvard to recognize ASL for language credit.
Although the class was originally going to be capped at 15 students, Bottoms raised the number of slots to 20 because of its popularity and used an application to select the students that would fill them.
“I ended up asking individuals what they’re contribution to the class was in terms of relevancy to the Deaf community,” he said.
Yasmin Yacoby ’19 studied ASL in high school and wanted to pursue it further. In her application, she mentioned an interest in becoming an ASL interpreter for theater performances.
Some students in the class, like Yacoby, entered with previous ASL experience, but Bottoms’ class, a totally immersive experience because he does not use an interpreter, may be different from what they have experienced before.
“It’s definitely not the way that I learned sign language. It’s being taught in a very different way, which is exciting for me,” she said. “Now it’s kind of like learning like you’re a kid and you learn when someone’s talking to you.”
Similar to Yacoby’s analogy, Bottoms said he jokingly refers to his ASL students as his “newborns.”
Another distinctive feature of the course is its emphasis on the culture of the Deaf community. On the first day of class, Bottoms showed a documentary about discrimination against deaf individuals, he said. He said he plans to introduce aspects of Deaf culture, such as the fact that ASL speakers are direct in their language in a way that may seem inappropriate to an outsider.
“I am against the idea of simply teaching language without understanding community because without community you don’t have language,” he said. “As a disenfranchised community and an oppressed minority, unfortunately we have experienced significant cultural appropriation.”
ASL is guaranteed at Harvard only for this year, but Bottom said he hopes the large amount of student interest in his course will encourage Harvard to increase its ASL offerings. Davies said she is optimistic that with a successful first year, Bottoms can return to teach the next sequence of courses.
“Clearly this is a thing that students are interested in and students want to have,” she said.

Harvard’s Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I” saw a significant drop in enrollment at Yale University as it kicks off its second year. In the meantime, the course staff have been busy making changes to the course’s curriculum, staff, and lecture structure.
At the start of Yale’s course selection, or “shopping,” period, fewer than 200 students were signed up to try out the class, compared to about 600 last year, according to the Yale Daily News. CS50 made an impressive debut at Yale last year, becoming the College’s most popular course of the fall semester with 510 students enrolled. A year later, the excitement and hype surrounding the imported Harvard course seems to have subsided.
Members of the course staff, however, are not surprised by the decrease in numbers. CS50 course instructor David J. Malan wrote in an email statement that the fall in enrollment was “to be expected,” given that last year was the first time the course was offered to Yale students.
“Whereas at Harvard, the course is new to just the incoming first years, at Yale the course was new to first years, sophomores, juniors, and seniors alike,” Malan said. “The course's first offering drew quite a few of those students, and we expect it will take some time for the course to be in equilibrium.”
Patrick Rebeschini, who is course instructor at Yale this year, said in an email that some Yale students did not expect the course to be as demanding as it was. This year, however, course instructors can count on “institutional memory” to ensure that students have a better understanding of what the course entails, he said.
“I know if you look on the CS50 website, it was always very clear that the course evaluations at Harvard said it was a difficult class,” Annie E. Chen, a Yale sophomore who took the class last fall and is now a Teaching Assistant for the course, said. “But there were definitely people who thought it would be one of their easier classes and were surprised by that.”
In order to make the class more accessible to students with little or no knowledge in coding, the Yale course has also added about ten more staff members, according to Rebeschini. Students can also attend walkthroughs of the current problem set on Wednesdays, led by Malan at Harvard and Rebeschini at Yale.
Among other changes this semester, students at both schools now have 10 days to complete problem sets, while they had seven days in previous years. Two of the course’s eight problem sets will now focus on the programming language Python instead of PHP.
In addition, students at both schools are now only required to attend the first and last lectures; every other lecture can be watched online.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Organizers of the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers answered questions about a potential contract, saying it would not follow a “one-size-fits-all” model, and communicated the goals of the union effort to roughly 20 graduate students at an information session held Wednesday.
The event began with panelists running through the basics of the union effort, the “roadmap” forward that the HGSU-UAW posted on its website, and the administration’s stance on their effort, which they say is to “inject uncertainty” into their election process.
Graduate School of Arts and Sciences dean for administration and finance Allen Aloise wrote in an emailed statement, “It’s important for students to get engaged in this conversation however and wherever they can. We want students to freely share ideas, ask questions and to get information in the spirit of open discourse that is the hallmark of this university.”
Union supporter and Ph.D. student Niharika N. Singh, one of the speakers at the event, said a union will make the decision-making process more democratic, hold the administration accountable, and create a sense of community.
“A union will not impose a one-size-fits-all policy,” Singh said. “A contract can really cater to specific needs of departments and professional schools, and we decide what those priorities are.”
Although the HGSU-UAW has not yet announced when the union election will take place, Yale’s union effort filed a petition for an election quickly after the National Labor Relations Board ruled that teaching and research assistants are employees under the law. This week, Yale administrators challenged the union effort for attempting to hold elections department by department, taking advantage of a new rule allowing for “microunit” elections. The NLRB hearing is expected to be completed within a week.
HGSU-UAW spokesperson and Ph.D. student Jack M. Nicoludis did not say whether HGSU-UAW will follow Yale’s strategy. “It will be interesting to see what happens at Yale,” he said.
During a question and answer session, Nicoludis answered a question about whether multiple contracts would be needed to cater to the needs of different departments.
“It wouldn’t be a different contract. The contract would be extensive and include provisions for different departments,” Nicoludis said.
Union organizer and Ph.D. student Abigail Weil said although a union would be new to Harvard, graduate students have been unionized at public universities for years.
“We’re not inventing the concept of it. Graduate worker contracts at other universities are not a one-size- fits-all model; that doesn’t work,” Weil said.
This information session comes on the heels of last week’s meeting between the HGSU-UAW and University labor representatives. Nicoludis added that during the meeting, University representatives said “they have no plans to enter any litigation about the legality of our being able to unionize” after an election is held. Nicoludis called this “promising.”
But Director of Harvard’s Office of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran, who organized the meeting, did not verify Nicoludis’ statement.
“We’re not yet at a point where determinations have been made about the scope of the potential bargaining unit and other logistics, so it’s premature to speak to those matters,” Curran wrote in an email through GSAS director of communications Ann Hall.
Several first-year graduate students attended the information session in order to get their questions answered. But one first-year Ph.D. student, Canaan Morse, did not need any convincing.
“My final decision [for a Ph.D. program] came down to Harvard versus Berkeley. And one of the reasons I almost went to Berkeley is because they’re unionized,” Morse said. “At this point I don’t have too many questions because I am fairly aware of why I am here and why this needs to happen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College is launching a new online sexual assault prevention training module and requiring all undergraduates to complete the program by mid-October.
Spurred by a sexual conduct climate survey from last fall that found what University President Drew G. Faust deemed a “deeply disturbing” atmosphere on campus, the new module complies with recommendations from a University-wide task force on sexual assault prevention that advocated annual sexual assault prevention training.
With images, videos, and text, the interactive online presentation will attempt to accomplish two goals, according to an email to undergraduates from Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana: to inform students of the resources available for gender-based harassment and sexual assault, and to educate undergraduates about Harvard’s sexual and gender-based harassment policies.
Emily J. Miller, the College’s Title IX coordinator, said the module is not intended to be a complete and standalone training, adding the College anticipates “we will continue to roll things like this out in the future.”
“This is not meant to be an all-inclusive training on sexual assault prevention and response,” Miller said. “Why I think an online forum is appropriate for this type of material is that it’s really a lot of information.”
Last year’s Association of American Universities sexual conduct survey found that 31 percent of senior undergraduate females at Harvard College who responded said they had experienced “nonconsensual sexual contact” during their time at the College. A task force convened to address the issue recommended that students receive annual sexual assault prevention training, among other changes such as potentially banning hard alcohol and looking into restricting undergraduate participation in the College’s unrecognized single-gender final clubs.
The module was announced in a College-wide email from Khurana Wednesday, and he stipulated that all undergraduates must complete the program by Oct. 10. The training will be completed by each student on an annual basis, and the College may modify the training module with every new installation, Miller said.
At the end of the module, students must take an exam to measure their apprehension and answer at least 80 percent of the questions correctly. If students do not complete the tutorial or do not receive satisfactory scores, Miller will “be in touch and will follow up until they complete the training.”
Undergraduates can choose to opt-out of the program by contacting the Title IX Office, and those who do will individually receive a condensed version of the training via email. The choice to opt-out, according to Miller, is intended for students who do not feel comfortable completing the training.
While designing the survey, Miller said she emphasized the importance of helping students more easily understand Harvard’s at times confusing sexual assault policies. College staff consulted undergraduates from a range of student groups—such as the Undergraduate Council and Consent Advocates and Relationship Educators—to develop the training, Miller added.
During the development phase, these students gave feedback on the presentation, took part in early focus groups, and reviewed the training’s script.
“When you’re in this work long enough, you can start to forget what doesn’t make sense, so it was really important to have fresh eyes,” Miller said.
Undergraduates involved in its development praised the module.
Undergraduate Council president Shaiba Rather ’17 said she was “extremely happy” with the new training module. Rather, along with UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17, began working with the College on the training early last semester.
Jessica R. Fournier '17, an organizer of sexual assault prevention advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better, said her group was involved in developing the training. She called the module a step in the right direction.
“I don’t think having an online training is a replacement for in-person training where you can go more in depth and have more of a conversation,” Fournier said. “But I do think that this is a really good way to make sure all students are seeing this information.”
Miller emphasized the module exists not only as a one-time training, but as a resource should students want information about sexual assault and resources available at Harvard.
“We really want to educate people about the resources and policies and I’m not so naive as to think everyone will absorb every piece of this and absorb it forever,” Miller said, “but my hope is that students will remember it’s there if they want to go back to it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the Harvard College Queer Students and Allies announced a new policy making the group politically neutral, BLGTQ students and allies, including a co-chair of QSA, denounced the decision and circulated a  petition expressing opposition.
During a recent meeting of the QSA, the College’s main BGLTQ student organization, attendees elected new club officers and collectively endorsed the policy, according to an email sent over the the group’s listserv.
While “QSA will remain committed to advocating for LGBTQ+ students on campus and LGBTQ+ issues in the world at large,” the new policy reads, the organization will “remain politically neutral on issues that do not affect LGBTQ+ people explicitly because of their queer identity,” according to the email.  A “majority” of the board and attendees at the meeting, held Sunday, believed that QSA would best maintain its role as a “blanket LGBTQ+ advocacy group” by eschewing political affiliations. The group “could not unanimously agree on a statement,” the email reads.
The decision has created divisions within QSA. Shortly after the announcement was emailed, the group’s  co-chair, Ted Waechter ’18 sent a Google form titled “Petition for an Intersectional QSA” over the same listserv, encouraging members to reject the new policy.
The announcement of the new policy also spurred immediate outcry of the QSA listserv. The group’s new politics co-chair— “responsible for ensuring that awareness about the intersection of LGBT and political issues is maintained on campus,” according to the organization’s constitution—replied to the listserv indicating he was not present at the decision and also did not support the new policy.
According to the petition, 15 members of QSA voted in favor of political neutrality, which the petition characterizes as an “explicitly and intentionally un-intersectional policy.”
The new policy “preemptively ends any conversation about acting in solidarity with other groups,” the petition reads, including the Black Lives Matter movement and HUDS workers, whose union is currently threatening to strike.
“It is impossible to disconnect queerness and its oppressions from other identities or forms of oppression,” the petition continues. “QSA cannot pretend to represent the BGLTQ+ community at Harvard if it does not come through for all of us.”
Waechter, a Crimson editorial editor, and several other members of QSA declined to comment on the decision. In addition, Waechter, who declined to identify the people who voted for the new policy, said QSA had collectively decided not to speak to reporters on the issue. Waechter also did not indicate the number of signatures the petition had garnered.
Several other Harvard affiliates spoke out against the neutrality policy.
Brianna J. Suslovic ’16, formerly an active member of QSA, said she thought the policy constituted an “erasure” of BLGTQ and questioning students who are “processing other parts of their identity simultaneously.”
“For an organization that purports to be for queer people at Harvard to not take into account the ways that other identities affect individual and group politics feels frustrating to me,” Suslovic said.
Carla Troconis ’19, director of the upcoming play “The Submission,” renounced the QSA’s sponsorship of her production. She said the organization’s decision was inconsistent with the message of the play.
“The whole point of the show is to highlight that marginalized groups tend not to support each other, and that’s really problematic,” Troconis said. “How are we supposed to fight against oppression by the majority when you’re being oppressed by fellow minorities?”
Casey R. Goggin ’19, who will play the lead role in “The Submission,” said that political neutrality could make the QSA seem like an “exclusive, unwelcoming, and uncomfortable” environment for many of its members.
“It was a very eerie decision for the QSA to make because the show is very explicitly calling for intersectionality between the queer community and specifically the black community, but also all other marginalized groups,” Goggin said. “We definitely don’t feel like QSA is the most appropriate sponsor for that anymore, which is heartbreaking.”
Gavin Sullivan ’17, a former member of the Queer Advisory Council—an undergraduate group that advises the Office of BGLTQ Student Life—and current vice president of Harvard Republicans, said that he considered the policy QSA’s attempt to be a “Big Tent” group for Harvard’s BLGTQ population.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In what could be its toughest stretch of the season, Harvard men’s soccer (2-1-1) heads to California this weekend to play No. 25 Stanford (1-1-3) on Friday and The University of California (1-2-1) on Sunday.
This road trip is of importance not only because it’s the team’s first of the season, but also because the trip kicks off with the Crimson facing its toughest opponents, which includes Stanford, the 2015 NCAA Champions. Harvard’s last game against Stanford was in 2011, with the Cardinals ultimately prevailing 1-0 in a highly defensive contest. Going into the weekend’s clash, Stanford holds a 6-1 lead in the series between the two squads.
“It’ll be a great opportunity to play against the national champions of last year, we’re excited for the challenge,” senior forward Jake Freeman said. “We know we can beat any team in the nation and feel that way and just want to get the chance to go out there and show that. It’ll be fun to see where we stand against one of the top teams in the nation.”
After several tests at home, including wins at home against Villanova and its most recent against Washington, the Crimson is more than confident in its ability to handle any opponent and is carrying its momentum into these next few away games.
Stanford will be no easy test, however. Despite starting the season with a rather pedestrian 1-1-3 record after four double-overtime matches, the team still poses a dangerous threat. The potential of the team was seen in its last game, in which four players contributed to its dominant 4-1 victory over San Jose State.
Despite the opponent, Harvard doesn’t plan on going into its matchup with Stanford with any different mindset than it had going into any other game this season.
“We go in every game and we just want to compete for each other” senior midfielder Dan Smith said. “Be it against UW (University of Washington) Hofstra or even Stanford, the defending national champion, we just want to go out and compete.”
Less than 48 hours after its clash with Stanford, the Crimson will turn its attention to its other West Coast opponent: the University of California Golden Bears. This matchup is of note because it is the first time these two teams have faced against each other in almost 17 years, last playing in October of 1999.
Similarly to Stanford, Cal hasn’t gotten off to the strongest of starts this season, most recently losing 5-0 to now No.1 Notre Dame. However, the Golden Bears finished last season with a 9-6-2 record, including a very strong 7-1-2 record at home, and has not lost at home this season. Dating back to 2010-2011 season, Cal has compiled a .623 winning percentage at home compared to a .426 winning percentage on the road, suggesting that it plays significantly better in front of its home crowd.
Despite facing a tough back to back set of games this weekend, Harvard is focused on approaching its opponents one at a time. On the offensive side, the team will look to continue to improve its chemistry to create more chances in is attacking third, and therefore more goals. To do this, it will depend on the efforts of its seniors, who have carried the offense thus far. Defensively, junior goalie Kyle Parks and Smith will need to bring the defense together to keep Stanford and Cal off the scoreboard.
“We just look ahead to the next game on the schedule, which in this case is Friday and we’ll prepare like we have to for that game,” Freeman said. “Once that game is over we’ll prepare for Cal. We’ll have Saturday during the trip to scout them and think about what we want to do for Sunday. But for right now we’re just thinking about Friday for Stanford”.
For this road trip, the team will look to echo Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer’s philosophy of taking on each challenge one at a time, starting with the matchup against the Cardinal.
“I think right now the only game we’re approaching is Stanford and once we’re done with that game the only game we’ll be approaching is Cal.” Smith said.
After its games in California this weekend, the Crimson will play its next game on the road at Iona before returning home on September 27, when it faces off against BU.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

It is often when playing against completely new teams that a team develops. It is in these matchups that it realizes both the skills of which it has attained mastery, and what it needs to work on.
For the past two weekends, the Harvard women’s volleyball team (1-5) has stood face-to-face with unfamiliar opponents, both at the Beantown Challenge and the Baden Invitational hosted by Long Beach State. In these two tournaments, the team failed to establish itself on a new stage, dropping five of its six games in that stretch.
Being back in Eastern Standard Time this past Tuesday brought no new luck, as the team failed to pick up a win in its trip to New Hampshire.
“We’re definitely going to use that [UNH loss] as motivation,” Kebe said. “Hopefully that will be enough to push us through.”
But this upcoming weekend, the Crimson will match up against its crosstown rivals, providing an opportunity to see how the squad stacks up against regular foes.
Harvard will host Northeastern (6-4) and Boston College (5-3) at the New England Challenge this weekend. In last year’s rendition, the Crimson bested the Huskies, but fell to the Eagles in five sets.
But things have changed over the past year.
Unlike it had been for the past four years, Caroline Holte ‘16, Hannah Schmidt ‘16, Sindhu Vegesena ‘16 and Kathleen Wallace ‘16 no longer suit up for the Crimson. The quartet had a consistent impact in each of those years, having played 1,285 sets over the course of their careers at Harvard in which they helped bring home back-to-back Ivy League titles.
Senior Grace Weghorst also no longer is on the roster after dealing with nagging back injuries over the past few years. In her sophomore year, she finished second in kills en route to the Crimson’s first Ivy League title since 2004.
With the loss of five impact players, the Crimson will look to lean on its incoming freshman class to maintain the squad’s competitiveness.
“It’s important that we also are comfortable enough playing together and that’s going to come with time,” co-captain Corie Bain said. “Games like [UNH] are important to bring us together.”
With the departure of Vegesena, freshman Isabelle Tashima has taken full ownership of the libero position for Harvard. In her seven-game stint, the rookie has notched over three digs per set.
Other rookies have also stepped up and made an immediate impact. Maclaine Fields and Grace Roberts Burbank rank third and fifth in kills, respectively, while Erin McCarthy has filled in as a backup setter to three-team All-Ivy First Team member Corie Bain.
“Our freshmen are amazing,” sophomore Christina Cornelius said. “They have such great talent.”
If Cornelius is as good at recognizing talented freshmen as she was at being one herself, things bode well for Harvard. The California native’s 133 total blocks last year—a total good for second in program history—and her 2-plus kills per set were in large part why she was named Ivy League Rookie of the Year. This year, the sophomore will look to take an expanded role on offense by also spending time outside.
“Last season was a pretty good season for me,” Cornelius said. “And I’m just trying to improve and help the team as much as possible.”
With its top killer in Wallace gone to graduation, junior Caroline Labanowski, Paige Kebe, and sophomore Jocelyn Meyer will look to fill in the void the offensive vacuum. The three finished fifth, sixth, and eighth in kills per set last season, but the team will look to rely more heavily on them with Wallace’s 227 kills from last year gone.
All of these pieces will look to supplement senior setter Corie Bain as she sets out to finish one of the most storied volleyball careers in Ivy League history. After three All-Ivy First Team bids and two Ivy League championships in her first three years with the Crimson, Bain is now taking on another title entering this year: co-captain. As the sole senior on the team, Bain’s leadership—both on and off the court—is as important as ever.

Contrary to popular belief, the walk from your dorm to class to the dining hall to another class and back to your dorm does not count as strenuous exercise. Of course, from psets to recruiting events to extracurricular meetings, Harvard students have a litany of excuses for why we don’t have time to work out.
But what if the workout was awesome and intense and free? After all, college students love free stuff.
Until this Saturday, The Handle Bar is offering free classes to walk-in customers who show a valid student ID. Basically, all of Harvard could go to a legitimate spin class for free. What could be better than finally getting the cardio you’ve been pushing off for weeks in?
We here at Flyby decided to check it out and document the six stages of stages of spinning misery (and triumph):
Realizing you are probably the least fit person in the class.There are svelte Cambridge soccer moms surrounding you. Their calves are in better shape than your organic chemistry grade. You weep softly.
 Wondering how on earth someone can stay so cheerful while spinning.This may or may not be directed at the peppy instructor who can somehow still shout encouragement while spinning at 5 rpm faster than everyone else: Thanks, but no thanks. But also, if you weren’t shouting at me I might actually have stopped moving my legs completely 5 minutes ago so...really, thanks.
 Drinking more water in one 45 (or 60!) minute class than you have in an entire day.You realize the importance of staying hydrated. You silently thank all of the clubs (looking at you, DAPA) who generously gave free water bottles. You then silently thank HUDS, Harvard bless their souls (and health), for always cleaning said water bottles.
Feeling like your legs have never burned so much. Ever.How fast are you going? You’re probably going faster than that one time you had to had 5 minutes to make it from Sever to Science Center to turn in your problem set before it would be marked late. Probably.
Becoming convinced that you might just not make it to the end of this class.Would it be socially acceptable to just give up? Wait, Harvard students don’t give up, unless it’s giving up in the sense of deciding to take CS50 pass/fail. You keep going.
Finally finishing, and feeling more triumphant than you did after finishing an exam.And to think, you only cried twice.
Before midterm season hits us and you’re relegated to the sole triumphant feeling of making it out of an exam still breathing, do your body a favor, put your utilitarian college-student brain to work, and milk these free Handle Bar spin classes. You won’t regret it.
