After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2017, HBO released a film based on the book “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks” by Rebecca Skloot. Starring Rose Byrne and Oprah Winfrey, the story analyzes the life of those related to Henrietta Lacks, a black woman who died of cervical cancer and whose cells were taken for research without consent. Her cells became the first line to survive indefinitely, allowing for consistency in results across labs, and helped perfect a cure for polio as well as many other important scientific discoveries. In honor of Black History Month, it is important to recognize Lacks’ impact on science and discuss the portrayal of the Lacks family both on the page and on the screen. While both film and novel portray Henrietta’s story in an enlightening way, the film cedes the book’s scientific rigor in favor of a more sentimental tone.
The novel begins with some basic information on cells and how Skloot, the author, became interested in HeLa cells—the epithet for Lacks’ cells—and the life of Lacks. Before Skloot gets into too much detail about her contact with the Lacks family, she spends about half the novel explaining the history of the scientist, George Gey, who took the sample from Lacks and made HeLa cells so widely available. She also takes the time to meticulously set up the context of the medical business in what was a much less just time: She differentiates between the ethical and illegal standards amongst researchers. This distinction is important because, while the Lacks family was taken advantage of in an ethical sense, they did not have a case that would hold up in a court of law. She makes sure to highlight the cases in which black people were treated inhumanely by researchers, an important aspect of ‘50s life to underline in light of the story’s many implications. This contextualization is crucial in presenting the kind of culture and racial tensions that existed in the world of scientific research at the time of Henrietta’s illness.
Where the film lacks the contextualization that so greatly enhanced the book, it boasts an emotional dimension absent in Skloot’s work. The HBO film is told purely through the journey of Rebecca (Rose Byrne) and Deborah (Oprah Winfrey), Henrietta Lacks’ daughter. There is a lot less scientific background given in the film, which allows it to focus more on a human interest aspect. Deborah appears deeply distressed throughout the majority of the movie because of the number of times her family has been taken advantage of. Her anguish makes it difficult for Rebecca to get her to open up, and there are many highly emotional moments between the two women. This level of sentiment is lacking in the novel and is one of the things that makes the film worth watching.
The film misses out on Skloot’s intricate setup—with her plethora of scientific facts— for the film’s emotional rawness. While the film portrays scenes that are in the book, the medium of film allows for more feeling. Winfrey is able to embody Deborah so genuinely, portraying despair, confusion, happiness and a range of emotions. Because the relationship between the two women is at the forefront of the film, it is the aspect that draws the most focus. It is clear that Rebecca Skloot is more of a scientific writer than a storyteller, and the tale of the Lacks family is substantially enhanced by the emotional performance of Oprah Winfrey and Rose Byrne.
Overall, however, both book and film complement each other by accentuating different aspects of the story. Both show how distressing the headlines about Henrietta’s cells are to the family— “HeLa Cells No Longer Human!” and “Enough HeLa Cells to Make a Whole Village.” Both mediums explain that their lack of scientific knowledge isn’t their fault, as many of them didn’t graduate high school because they had to work to support their family. But the book surpasses the film by providing even more information on this subject. For instance, it explains that the years the Lacks did go to school were not as fruitful as they could have been due to hearing problems many of the children share. It also talks about Deborah’s attempts to learn as much about HeLa cells and science as she possibly could, buying textbooks and taking detailed notes. This is a side of Deborah that should have been shown in more in the film.
Both the film and book of “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks” are entertaining, though they both take a different approach to tell the tale of the family’s plight for justice. Skloot’s work keeps with the scientific side of the situation, which adds socially relevant context to her book. However, HBO capitalizes on the Winfrey and Byrne’s magnificent performances, which makes the film more emotionally charged than the book could ever hope to be.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1951, Henrietta Lacks died of cervical cancer, despite receiving treatment from Johns Hopkins University. During her treatment, her doctor took a sample of her tumor. These so called HeLa cells—taken from Henrietta Lacks without her consent—have been used for years by scientists to understand diseases like cancer and have led to the polio vaccine.  Coincidentally during Black History Month, fifty-nine years after Lacks’ death, and eight years ago on February second, Henrietta is further immortalized by journalist Rebecca Skloot in her published a nonfiction book, and more recently in an HBO special, both titled “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.”
Debuting on April 22, 2017, “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,” discusses the struggles of the family after Henrietta’s death, the effects of racism in the scientific community, and the amazing things Henrietta’s cells have done for science. On the eighth anniversary of the novel, it’s worth taking a look at the touching film that documents the pain the Lacks family still feels after being lied to by Johns Hopkins University about their own mother.
For most of the film Rebecca Skloot (Rose Byrne), a journalist interested in the Lacks’, and Henrietta’s daughter Deborah Lacks (Oprah Winfrey) travel around the country trying to piece together Henrietta’s past. However, this proves more difficult than expected because the family barely trusts Rebecca. Considering how much the Lacks family has been lied to—specifically by white people who are looking to profit off of their mother’s cells—the family is wary of Rebecca, who appears to the family to be just another outsider trying to take advantage of them. It is not made any easier by Deborah’s history of a diverse group of mental health problems.
Oprah does an excellent job playing Deborah Lacks. She acutely depicts the family’s pain and the confusion that accompanies it. Her character simultaneously portrayed the nostalgia the Lacks family felt towards Henrietta as well as the psychological damage that comes with a situation like this. Oprah perfectly exemplified a daughter hoping to learn more about her mother, but also brought tremendous gravitas in her portrayal of Deborah’s mental disorders. In these moments, Deborah’s agony is palpable as she tries to grapple with her desire to know more about her mother and her distrust of others.
This film does an excellent job explaining the scientific relevance of HeLa cells without feeling like a scientific documentary. Instead, it is an emotional movie about a family who has been taken advantage of and the generational consequences of exploitation. Although the scientific facts are important, the focus on the human element makes for a movie with a more coherent story.
“The Immortal Life” is a poignant film about race relations both in the 1950s and today. The Lacks family had little research-level education, a reality scientists used to justify the taking of Henrietta’s cells without giving the family any of the profit. This is not true for all scientists—in fact many are quite grateful—but those who believe Johns Hopkins University acted ethically often point to the family’s lack of education as a driving factor for why they didn’t need to be a part of the operation. Instead of taking the opportunity to teach those who need it, the university exploited an imbalance in educational attainment to get more information from the family and keep them unaware of the fact that they are being cheated out of large sums of money.
The movie compellingly intertwines the scientific and the dramatic. Not only does it tell of the important role that HeLa cells have played in creating vaccines and understanding deadly diseases, it also discusses the trauma caused to a family who lost a loved one. The family did more than lose Henrietta: they were also cheated out of any recognition or a cut of the millions of dollars that Johns Hopkins has made off of the distribution of the HeLa cells. This film exhibits an interesting intersection of race relations and science that forces the question of the ethicality of practices that are still in effect today.
We also take a more specific look at how the documentary adapts and represents the book itself in our ongoing series, “Page to Screen.” Check it out here.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three weeks ago, in one of the weirder things I’ve done in my short life, I stood for five hours outside the suburban home of Tracy P. Palandjian ’93, a member of the Harvard presidential search committee. I’m not a reporter by training, but I am an extra body and my phone has a camera, so I got drafted by the Newsies to stand in the street and take pictures of large black Secret Service-esque Chevy Suburbans that were driving up and down this leafy green Belmont neighborhood.
I’ll be quite honest: I don’t know who was in those SUVs. (Until Dec. 31, I served as president of The Crimson, but now I am old and washed up and out of the loop, and so even if one of the reporters knows, I do not.)
It doesn’t seem that hard to guess, however. Past presidential searches suggest that candidates are only invited to meet with larger segments of the search committee at a relatively advanced stage in the process, so it seems reasonable to suggest that the dozen people convened at Palandjian’s house were searchers. With some likelihood, the search committee is zeroing in on its top few choices.
As they debate those final few, I’d like to make the case for being willing to break with some tradition: Specifically, that the corner office in Massachusetts Hall be the province of former deans and provosts, themselves former professors, and with Ph.D.s all.
University President Drew G. Faust was the Dean of the Radcliffe Institute and an accomplished professor of history. Her predecessor, Lawrence H. Summers, was an economics professor. Before him was Neil L. Rudenstine, a professor of English who was a dean and provost at Princeton for decades, and before him was Derek C. Bok, the dean of Harvard Law School.
There’s a certain elegance in this tradition. Like the citizen-soldier called up to defend their home, America’s universities are led by the academics themselves, learned men and women who give up their scholarship for a few years to serve as dean or provost or even president. They know their roots, and they’re willing to fight for them.
In some sense, this represents the actualized peak of faculty governance. Regardless of the ritualized food fights between administrators and professors, ultimately a faculty member governs.
Yet today faculty governance seems on its deathbed thanks to administrative centralization and the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, and it’s hard to think of any other major unit in American society that requires its leaders to have been drawn from its own ranks.
Politics has been friendly to late-career entrants long before President Donald Trump. CEOs, too, hardly need have started from the bottom, for studios aren’t run by actors, nor airlines by pilots. Even in the military, that bastion of hierarchy, the philosophical commitment to civilian leadership runs deep.
Don’t get me wrong: There’s nothing bad about having a former professor as president, and holding a Ph.D. should only ever be a plus. Yet I hope that is a secondary consideration to the skills needed for the job, regardless of from whence they’re found.
Presidents are not deans. Though ultimately charged with the core academic mission of Harvard University—undoubtedly the most important objective—the president’s responsibilities are wider-ranging. The academic and curricular decisions of the schools have often historically fallen to Harvard’s many deans.
Indeed, though perhaps sharing an appreciation for scholarship and the life of a professor, a future president-née-academic will only have expertise in a singular field, knowledge that cannot possibly expand to cover all of Harvard’s myriad schools, departments, faculties, and individuals.
After all, the challenges and opportunities that Harvard faces today are not primarily academic in nature, but financial, governmental, and political.
The trajectory of this institution is shaped, more so than by any academic decision, by the stewardship of its budget, the performance of its endowment, and the success of its fundraising. Everything, quite obviously, is underpinned by money. Faculty hiring, the size of the student body, research funding, and even the success of the General Education program are all dependent on the budget.
So much, too, depends on the University’s relationship with Washington. Financial woes are exacerbated by a recently-imposed endowment tax on universities. Harvard’s lawyers are busy responding to a Department of Justice investigation of the Admissions Office. The College’s sanctions on unrecognized single-gender social organizations, after surviving two committees, two faculty motions, and almost 20 months of campus sturm und drang, may well be ended, not by a vote of the Corporation but by an Act of the Congress. It makes sense that the searchers might have lobbying for Harvard as a key qualification.
These questions are too important to outsource to the Development Office, Harvard Management Company, or the three-person Washington lobbying office. Perhaps that is one of the reasons the Corporation—a diverse body of academics, business leaders, lawyers, and ex-government types—has taken on a more active role. (It is more than a little surprising that the Corporation is willing to weigh in on where undergrads spend Saturday evenings.)
To her credit, Faust has taken a relatively hands-on role with the highly successful capital campaign, a place where she said in 2014 that she was devoting half her time, and on advancing Harvard’s interests in D.C. It is good fortune that she seems to have been a good choice for the turbulent times through which she has led Harvard.
But that happy coincidence of academic leadership and financial or governmental adroitness may not always occur, or if it does, it necessarily will occur more rarely. We need a firm, experienced, and knowledgeable hand on the tiller in uncertain times, whatever the romanticized elegance may be of a former dean learning the ropes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust announced Tuesday in an email to Harvard affiliates that the University will “seek to become fossil fuel free by 2050 by meeting [its] energy needs with sustainable sources.” The announcement comes in light of recent attention directed toward climate change both on campus and internationally. In her email, Faust wrote, “We have continued to witness the detrimental effects of climate change here in the United States and around the world.” To tackle this challenge, the University created a 10-year sustainability plan in 2008 and ultimately accomplished its emissions goals with the assistance of its task force on climate change.
While Harvard’s increased sustainability may not significantly reduce global emissions, we commend the University for building off its previous success and taking action that will encourage other institutions to do the same. As a prominent institution of higher learning and fixture of the Boston area, Harvard’s ability to set precedent is a powerful tool to fight climate change in and of itself, as evidenced by Boston and Cambridge’s collaboration in the 2050 plan.
We further support the University’s efforts to use its own progress in sustainability as a testing ground for future innovation. In her email, Faust described plans to “strengthen and expand” the Living Lab Research Initiative, whose efforts include bringing together “multi-disciplinary teams of students and faculty on our campus and in neighboring communities to pilot innovative and creative solutions to the climate crisis.” Indeed, this initiative offers a model that showcases the practical applications of the newest research and innovations in sustainability, and, in addition to the rest of Harvard’s on-campus efforts, has the potential to inspire other universities and large-scale institutions to seriously consider courses of action similar to Harvard’s 2050 plan.
Although we commend these recent efforts and look forward to those stemming from Tuesday’s announcement, the University can best address climate change on a global scale by expanding the resources it dedicates to research on climate change and sustainable innovation. We applaud the efforts of the Climate Change Solutions Fund and the Harvard Global Institute, which—through Faust’s efforts—have dedicated more than $11 million to research that offers insights into fighting climate change.
Eleven million dollars clearly represents significant investment on the University’s part, although it feels insufficient in light of, for instance, the $50 million the University has pledged to developing an Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority station in Allston, or the 36 percent decrease, by one estimate, that climate change will have on the country’s GDP per capita by the end of the century. While Harvard should not bear sole responsibility for fighting climate change through research, its position as a leader of and role model for higher education should mandate a greater allocation of resources toward this task. Without increasing investments in climate change research, Harvard risks limiting its positive environmental impact to its own campus, which is completely insignificant when compared to the global problem of climate change.
Given the conclusive evidence supporting the existence of anthropogenic climate change and its pernicious effects, Harvard must take advantage of every efficacious strategy to fight it. We have previously decried ineffective methods of fighting climate change, and we are glad to see the University take on this initiative for its presumably meaningful impact through both direct effects and influence in inspiring other institutions. Nevertheless, if the University aspires to be a true leader in the fight against climate change—as it should—it must devote much more to researching strategies to curb it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Each time we eat a meal, throw out the garbage, or hop into a car, we participate in a global system that emits increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and air pollution into the atmosphere and directly fuels a feedback loop of environmental and social damage. Current climate science tells us that we have exceeded safe levels of greenhouse gas emissions. Present and future generations depend on us to build a resilient world in the face of the significant climate-driven changes that we are seeing in our lifetimes.
Some of the largest companies and universities in the world have recognized that, by setting institutional greenhouse gas reduction goals, they can meet their ethical obligations and possess a competitive advantage in a future of constraints on carbon footprint. On Tuesday, Harvard recognized its own obligation and announced its new climate commitment: to be fossil fuel-neutral by 2026 and fossil fuel-free by 2050.
As students on the Climate Change Task Force who recommended these goals, we recognize that we bear the responsibility to build resilience, limit emissions, and mitigate damages, and we are ready to hold the University accountable to its commitments.
To achieve fossil fuel neutrality by 2026, the University will need to aggressively reduce on-campus fossil fuel emissions and compensate its remaining fossil fuel emissions through off-campus emission reduction projects. By 2050, all energy heating, cooling, and powering the University’s facilities will have to come from fossil fuel-free energy sources. In addition, the University must significantly reduce the carbon footprint of its externally purchased services, including food, waste, air travel, and investments. We believe that all actions to mitigate emissions, direct or indirect, are equally crucial to Harvard’s achievement of a truly fossil fuel-free university.
Much has changed since Harvard last convened a task force, in 2008, to establish its own emissions standards. While Harvard successfully achieved its 2008 goal of a 30 percent reduction of emissions from 2006 levels by 2016, it has become clear that we need to do more. The impacts of climate change are happening faster—and with greater impact—than scientists previously thought. Meanwhile, as a society, we lack basic awareness of the many ways we can limit the impact of the carbon footprint associated with our lifestyles.
Harvard’s commitments are a promise to fight climate change and mitigate the social damages that extend beyond a single institution, consistent with global efforts to avoid the dangers associated with two degrees Celsius warming by 2100. As students affiliated with the College, Kennedy School, Business School, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, School of Public Health, and School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, we affirm that becoming fossil fuel-free is necessary in this endeavor.
With each passing year, the trend in increasing global greenhouse gas emissions has continued, and more people suffer the impacts of extreme and unusual weather conditions and sea level rise. We experience the rapid melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and record global temperatures year after year. It’s time to act.
The damages do not stop at melting ice sheets and extreme weather conditions. Fossil fuel combustion releases other air pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, and fine particulate matter, which have been shown to increase the frequency of asthma attacks, heart attacks, and premature mortality. By reducing energy use by 30 percent, Harvard is averting $10 million of health damages each year compared to 2006, but the health damages of are still conservatively estimated to be $25 million as of 2016 (estimated using CoBE, a tool that determines the health damages related to energy consumption). Our action on this front is overdue.
While climate change is a global pollution problem, its effects are distributed unevenly at local and regional levels. Coastal and desert communities receive the brunt of the impacts of sea-level rise and desertification. Toxic air pollutants from energy production and transportation affect the health of our local communities, and research has shown significant disparities in air quality between low- and high-income neighborhoods. As we learn more about the scale at which our impacts occur, we must target our interventions to meet diverse needs.
We believe that Harvard has a unique opportunity to influence local and global fossil fuel emission and air pollution reduction strategies by following the Task Force’s recommendations. Cutting-edge and collaborative research allows Harvard to develop climate change solutions and address its impacts. Centrally, Harvard provides coursework and educational tools that enable students and community members to understand and actively respond to climate-related issues. We are encouraged by the growing number of applied science and policy courses available to students at all schools, including the three-year Climate Change Living Lab course which seeks to develop off-campus emission reduction strategies that the University can use.
Abiding by the mission of the College, “to educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society,” Harvard’s operational practices and policies can provide a model for other large, complex institutions to set and achieve their own goals. Above all, we believe that Harvard must conduct its decision-making with transparency to allow fossil fuel reduction and elimination strategies to advance along with current best practices. Such transparency ensures lessons learned can benefit local, regional, and global decision-makers and communities.
As global citizens, we can all take climate action—and we must. We can start by taking responsibility for our daily choices about our food, travel, waste, and energy use. We can broaden our impact by holding our institutions accountable to act alongside us with the urgency and transparency the world deserves.

Charles Sumner was one of Harvard’s favorite sons. He graduated in 1830 and seemed destined for greatness from an early age. Sumner’s classmate Rev. Dr. Samuel M. Emery recalled him as one who “never studied, as many young men do, for college honors, but for love of study and for cultivating his mind.” An ardent abolitionist, he would go on to represent Massachusetts in the United States Senate, leading the legislative fight against slavery during and in the wake of the Civil War.
When Sumner eventually passed away from a heart attack in 1874, the entire city of Boston entered a state of mourning. In his eulogy, Sumner was memorialized as “a ripe scholar, a profound statesman, an honest, earnest defender in the darkest hour, as well as at mid-day of freedom, justice and right.”
After his death, the Boston Art Committee looked to commemorate Sumner with a statue in his likeness, to be placed prominently in the recently constructed and now burgeoning Boston Public Garden. Towards this end, the Committee solicited designs for the statue from the greater community. They received countless submissions, including some from prominent architects of the day, before eventually settling on one which had been entered anonymously. The winner was a regal, seated version of Sumner, holding an open book in one hand and staring resolutely into the distance. Observers said it captured the great statesman’s thoughtful disposition.
Plans went forward on the statue, until someone tipped off Committee members about what they considered a scandalous secret: It had been designed by a woman.
Hysteria ensued. Outraged, the Committee deemed it obscene for a woman to model a man’s legs, and instead elected to construct its second-choice design, that of sculptor Thomas Ball.
While Sumner’s life story may have entailed a continual push for equality, the story of his memorial in many respects forms the opposite. The Ball statue and its upright, imposing portrait of Sumner—a far different depiction than the one first selected—has now stood in the Public Garden for over a century.
For Anne Whitney, the true originator of the neglected design, this likely did not come as a surprise. Born in Watertown, Mass., she was an enterprising female sculptor during an era when many deemed her craft appropriate for men alone. As a result, she had long faced discrimination.
An activist for much of her life, Whitney turned to sculpture during her 30s, seeing it as an ideal conduit for political dialogue. Her earlier works, most famously an 1869 statue of a Roman woman begging and an 1873 statue of Haitian revolutionary Toussaint L’Ouverture, stood out as unique because of the powerful positions in which she depicted her subjects. According to historian Elizabeth Rogers Payne, “most of her sculpture portrayed either champions of freedom or those oppressed by the lack of it.”
Writing to her brother and sister from Rome in 1875, shortly after learning of the snub of her statue of Sumner, Whitney wrote that she remained hopeful. “Bury your grievance, my dear Sarah and Edward,” she wrote. “It will take more than a Boston Committee to quench me.”
In the aftermath, she made sure to recover the original version of her Sumner statue, with the hope that one day it would finally go on permanent display. This early version in fact became part of a temporary exhibition at the 1876 United States International Exposition in Philadelphia. Nonetheless, soon after, the plaster prototype returned to some forgotten corner of Whitney’s Beacon Hill home where it began to slowly crumble away.
Her Sumner design languished for almost three decades until 1902, when the project was resurrected thanks to an anonymous donor. After being cast in bronze at a Chicopee, Mass. foundry, the statue was unveiled at the intersection of Cambridge Street, Kirkland Street, and Massachusetts Avenue, just outside of Harvard Yard’s Johnston Gate. Though she died in 1915, Whitney lived to see the debut of one of her final and most meaningful pieces.

In the beginning, God said, Let there be General Education, and there was General Education. And God saw that the General Education was good. And God said, Let there appear a shining gem in the midst of the my.harvard Crimson Cart. And God drafted the syllabus and called it Culture and Belief 39: “The Hebrew Bible,” and that was that. And the LORD constructed a lecture hall of olivewood and acacia eastward in Emerson where The Hebrew Bible would be taught, and the LORD called upon the children of Harvard, saying, great class. gem. take it. professor is fantastic… it’s BroBible.
God saw that there was nobody to tend to the Hall of Emerson. God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:  And let them have dominion over every creeping thing that creepeth on campus, searching for just about the easiest possible way to fulfill their Culture and Belief requirement in Harvard’s suite of approximately eight thousand five hundred fifty-three courses. So God created man in His own image and named him Shaye J. D. Cohen and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life. And God took the man and put him into the Hall of Emerson to profess the ways of The Hebrew Bible.
And it came to pass, when debaucherous men and women began to multiply in the Stacks, that God saw that the wickedness of man was great, and that the only thought of his heart was a less-than-three-hour weekly workload rating of 71 percent on the Q Guide in the Fall Term of the year two thousand and thirteen. And the LORD said, I will destroy the General Education I have created and the covetous section kids who seek to raise their sad GPAs from the dust of the earth.
But Shaye found grace in the eyes of the LORD. Shaye was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Shaye walked with God. God said unto Shaye, The end of General Education is come before me; for The Hebrew Bible is ridden with impishness and rampant grade inflation and over-enrollment. Make thee a 1636’er shuttle of gopher wood and ash. The length of the 1636’er shall be thirty cubits, the breadth of it ten cubits, and the height of it eight cubits. And, behold, I, even I, do bring plague upon Harvard, to destroy General Education and The Hebrew Bible. But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the 1636’er, thou, and thy TFs, and thy TFs’ preceptors with thee to keep them shielded from my wrath.
Thus did good Shaye, according to all that God commanded him.
And Shaye stretched forth his hand over Harvard, and the LORD touched His own righteous hand upon the waters of the River Charles, and the fragrant, medium-roast House Blend in the d-halls were turned to Fogbuster. And all the children of God digged round the river for palatable coffee to drink; for they could not bear to drink of the quasi-decaffeinated, earwax-flavored nectar that plagued them so. And the heart of the student body was hardened.
And in the selfsame day entered Shaye and the Hebrew Bible course staff into the 1636’er. It came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights that Shaye opened the doors of the 1636’er and sent forth a TF to see if the plague was abated from the face of the shuttle route. And the TF came flapping and fluttering to Shaye in the evening; and, lo, in her gentle beak was a sprig of HUDS Power Vegetable Salad Mix pluck’t from the d-hall. So upright Shaye knew that the faithful shuttle would make it to his 9 a.m. office hours right on time.
And God spake unto Shaye, saying, Go forth of the 1636’er, thou, and thy TF’s, and thy TFs’ preceptors with thee. The LORD said in His heart, I will not again curse the grounds of Harvard any more for the sake of student-kind; for the hearts of those scouring the earth for Q scores only above 3.9 are evil and impure from their youth.
And the LORD said, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you; I do set my great Q Guide rating scale in the cloud, and after it rains, when you behold its magnificent single shade of blue and incrementally darker shades of green to indicate increasing levels of satisfaction, you will remember my covenant with Harvard: The Hebrew Bible may remain, so long as it no longer counts as a gen-ed as of the fall semester of the year two-thousand and eighteen.
And Shaye went up from the sprawling plains of Tercentenary Theater unto the bell tower of Lowell to the rocky summit of William James Hall. Shaye, the virtuous servant of the LORD, was seven-hundred and sixty-two semesters old: His eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. And the LORD shewed him all the land of Harvard.
And the children of the prospective class of the year two-thousand and twenty-two mourned the outlook of their unofficial FAS transcripts for thirty days and thirty nights, crying out to the heavens, Blessed art thou, Shaye J. D. Cohen, sovereign of CULTBLF 39, who hallows us with good deed, commanding us to take only exams that comprise mostly of passage identifications and random Bible quotes we already learned in Sunday school eleven years ago.
And there arose not since a prophet like Shaye in Harvard, whom the LORD knew face to face.

From CRISPR to whole genome sequencing, the field of genetics has exploded over the past few decades. With public resources like ancestry.com and 23andMe, it’s easier than ever to evaluate the composition of your DNA at the push of a button. In an age where genotyping allows us all to discover our own heritage, what can we gain from understanding our ancestry?
Professor David A. Haig at the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology focuses on genetic imprinting and teaches a freshman seminar about the relationship between genetics and history called “Where are you from? Ancestry in the Age of Genomics.”
“Culture and biology interact in complex sorts of ways, and that’s what I am wanting to explore,” Haig says. “Some people suggest that this recent obsession with ancestry is a modern invention of genetics, but it’s not. People have been concerned about blood and their family and where they come from for a long time.”
Haig’s plan for the course is to mend a perceived rift between the humanities and sciences at Harvard—to help both those students interested in science and those interested in non-scientific fields to see the value of genetics across disciplines. Haig believes this change in perception may lead to more respect for genetics’ implications for cultural issues.
“The course looks at the interaction between culture and biology, so much about how we care about ancestry and sense of identity,” Haig says.
In his research, Haig continues to explore the effects of genetics on culture and evolution.
“In a lot of biology, the model of the body—going back to Descartes—the body is a machine, with all the parts working    together for some common end. I’m interested in situations where that model breaks down, and the genome in particular actually becomes a social organization with different entities, with different purposes and goals and ends,” Haig says.
More specifically, Haig says he is interested in sex-specific genes. “I started off in this field on the phenomenon of genomic imprinting, which refers to a subset of genes in our genome that retain a history of what sex they were in the previous generation. The gene does something different if you get it from your mother than if you get it from your father.”
Haig isn’t the only professor tackling the mystery of genetic heritage. Professor David E. Reich at the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School is conducting groundbreaking research on the use of genetics as a map to trace and predict diseases.
Similar to Haig, Reich focuses on humans’ shared evolutionary past. One of his past research endeavors made strides toward better understanding the ancestry of Indigenous Americans.
“What’s emerged from whole genome studies has contributed greatly to large proportions of genomes that we didn’t really recognize before,” Reich says. “Analyzing data has shown that the evidence is not consistent with the popular idea that all Native Americans descend from one lineage.”
Reich says he believes that genetics has the ability to give us a deeper look into our past.
“A lot of people have an idea of the types of people we see around us. We like to imagine an idea of certain groups and deep divisions between these groups,” Reich says. “However, our genetics is much more mixed up than we have presumed. Genetics can really be used as a way to explode those assumptions. It is clear in DNA that the existence of these divisions are incorrect.”
Though the field of genetics has made huge leaps, we still have a long way to go before we are fully aware of our ancestral origins, the professors say.
“Everybody’s story is wrong about who they are and where they came from,” Reich says. “We are all profoundly mixed up, and in some sense a lot of what we assume to know about our heritage is made up.”

The Chad X. Chadson Associate Dean of Online Affairs, Zack “Sectioning Tool” Dylan ’69, instantiated onto our mortal coil rather suddenly on Monday morning. His emergence triggered a burst of electromagnetic waves deep inside the servers of my.Harvard, sending a powerful signal deep into interstellar space. In one million years, alien astronomers will painstakingly decode his message, which reads I JUST DON’T THINK I’M BUILT FOR MONOGAMY.
Shortly after Sectioning Tool became electronically incarnated, he immediately insisted that all neighboring widgets call him “Slick” and made it very clear that his father was the influential Student Accounts icon. Sectioning Tool then announced loudly and repeatedly that he was going to the gym. He bounced between transistors for a few minutes, dramatically exhaling and visibly gulping electrons in what appeared to be a show of strength. Wiping excess pixels from his handsomely-formed gear icon, Sectioning Tool approached Course Search Bar at the barre.
“Wsup,” he said, spinning his gear icon at an unremarkable one meter per second in an obvious attempt at flirtation.
“Nothing much,” Course Search Bar replied, not looking up.
“I took Ec 10 back in the day,” said Sectioning Tool, furrowing his cogs. “If you haven’t heard of it, it’s this really hard class serious people like me take.” He followed with a loud laugh that sounded like the ungodly offspring of a dingo and a mid-80s synthesizer. This appeared to be an attempt at self-deprecation.
Course Search Bar did not say a word.
“I like to think of myself as fiscally conservative, but socially liberal,” added Sectioning Tool, without skipping a beat. “Have you read Hayek?”
Course Search Bar sighed and walked away. Sectioning Tool attributed Course Search Bar’s lack of interest in his economic posturing to the PC police and the intolerant left, a takeaway he would later tell to Advising Portal without any solicitation. He returned to his highly performative workout for about eight clock cycles before resuming his sectioning duties.
Residing happily in his little gridcell, Sectioning Tool gave high fives to all his bros sectioning for economics and statistics and asked everyone sectioning for Women, Gender, and Sexuality what they intended to do with their degree. He was careful not to keep track of anyone’s section preferences, as he was not looking for anything serious right now.
On Friday, after a week of exhausting existence, Sectioning Tool disappeared back into the ether with a crack. Like Mary Poppins or a management consultant, he travels where he is needed most. Rumor has it he’s been reincarnated as the Canvas icon for Stat 104.

I would like to see a new kind of teen girl feature film. A movie in which the girls-getting-ready-for-the-party scene isn’t preliminary to the action, or the lazy insert meant to communicate to the viewer, “These people are frivolous!,” but the rich and long-awaited conclusion. Or would it be asking too much for it to be the plot of the feature itself?
I was sitting in my final lecture of fall semester and thinking about cutting my hair short, maybe five inches off. When I walked out of the lecture hall I felt the surreal quality of something ending and the serious evaluation that follows. I ran into my friend whom I saw was also having a moment — he said, “I’m thinking about disappearing for a week or so.” And I nodded at him because I knew what he meant but this seemed melodramatic, and replied, “I think I’m just going to ask Te to cut my hair.” This act of grooming felt consequential enough.
I called my friend Te and within a few minutes I was in the chair in her dorm room where she has established her salon. She’s become great at a craft she can give away and she asks for nothing in return. The setup of her room itself connotes benevolence and warmth. The door is perpetually unlocked and we sit cross-legged. The girls who live here push the beds together. It’s a type of feminine infrastructure, a commons without tragedy.
I’ve been thinking about what Kristin Dombek wrote in her essay Letter from Williamsburg, “I… did what I’ve only ever done in secret, that is, away from the world of men.” Her words strike me as especially relevant to our cultural moment, given one purported objective of the #MeToo movement: to give the world (which always means the world of men) a window into the world of women. Those of us who are not men were actors in a secret world. But now we are talking in front of men in the same way we’ve talked forever “in secret.”
What else happens in this secret world? In Te’s room, we listen to music and talk about one another’s problems. We talk about boys, but not that much. And we get ready for parties. When my friends and I groom one another—for fun, for love, to look good, to burst with life, to scrub out every goo-hair-flake-scab, everything languid or dead—things are at odds. Our actions within this feminine infrastructure at once bolster it and prepare us to leave it behind.
Grooming among women demands answers for the same questions the self-care movement has to wrangle with (minus the question of immigrant labor providing the care, which is a big one). For whom do we groom? There’s no way of painting ourselves sweet-water cherry-mouth pretty that forgets completely about the world of men. The advice of feminist writer Jessa Crispin by way of Jezebel: “Just say that!... You can have two conflicting ideas. You can want to be fuckable and you can want to destroy the patriarchy. I have this same conflict. Everyone does.”
Which is what makes getting ready for parties, in particular, a complicated act. The aforementioned #MeToo-as-window-into-the-world-of-women metaphor, like every good metaphor, obscures quite a bit. Each story a woman tells does not just open a curtain to reveal indiscriminately whatever passes by. Both this processing of stories and this grooming before a party create a liminal space, a process that takes place between worlds. Both involve an effort of care, work, performance, and reservation. These are the moments when we are neither in the world of men nor wholly outside of it. We are preparing ourselves to enter that world. We do it physically, and we do it logistically, in the form the contingency plans we make just in case something bad were to happen—when going to a party feels akin to embarking on a dangerous mission.
And in this limbo we move in two directions: this intense engagement with exteriority that shepherds us outward also pulls us deeper inward. It gives way to the interiority of our girlfriends.
If you have seen a video of snow monkeys picking fleas out of each other’s coats, you know that they are awkwardly frenetic and warm and hold each other’s faces flat in their palms and will not let go until the last bug is gone. A Public Broadcasting Service special on the subject narrates the act, “In a community that depends upon one another for survival, grooming is the glue that binds the troupe together.”
In my favorite example of this union, Te and our friend Jacqueline used to shower in adjoining stalls most nights. This unguarded state gradually disassembled every barrier on the way to closeness. One night, before getting in, Te and Jacqueline talked for an hour outside the shower (it was not running) — and they loved each other so much — and Jacqueline felt in the pit of her stomach that she had to talk to Te. She was so excited to tell her everything.

Caroline R. Kaufman’s ’21 Instagram account @PoeticPoison now has more than 200,000 followers, but it started as a secret.
Kaufman was never aiming to be the next Rupi Kaur. At first glance, even though Kaur writes in Times New Roman and Kaufman in Cambria, the two poets seem to have much in common. Both writers eschew regular capitalization; both write short pieces of prose-like poetry; even Kaufman’s forthcoming collection, Light Filters In, resembles that of the cover of Milk and Honey, Kaur’s debut.
With her 2.2 million Instagram followers and two bestselling poetry collections, Kaur is the controversial paragon of the Instagram poet. Kaufman defends her: “People are relating to it and people are buying Rupi Kaur’s work, and even if you don’t think it’s poetry, it’s selling more books than you ever did.”
Kaufman didn’t start writing poetry at the age of 14 with the intention of selling books. Her Instagram account was nothing more than a kind of “catharsis:” a way to cope with mental illness, a diary with line breaks. She wanted to feel like she was “talking to someone, even if it was just a random stranger.” Although she expected to get only a few more followers out of it, she also found a community of other poets, mostly 16-year-old girls.
But within a year of creating her account, it “exploded” in popularity. Seemingly overnight, Kaufman had 100,000 new followers—none of whom knew who she was. In those days, she was still signing her poems with only an enigmatic “c.k.” These two letters permitted her to share truths about herself that she would never normally divulge, all while maintaining ownership of her work.
Her online presence was always a balance between vulnerability and disguise. She used to “post selfies and quickly delete them,” not ready to expose herself to her followers just yet; however, once, in the second year of the account, a follower recognized her in a mall. “That was the point where I realized this has become bigger than I ever thought it was going to be,” she says.
Publishers even began to contact her while she was still anonymous. Few of her friends, however, knew the account existed.
That carefully preserved anonymity ended dramatically during her junior spring, when she accidentally linked her anonymous Instagram account to her Facebook profile, and all of her friends received a notification. They were, understandably, confused.
“I wanted to hide in a hole and never come out again,” Kaufman says. “I went to school the next day and everyone was just looking at me. It was super uncomfortable for a long time.”
But, she adds, it has been liberating in one respect. “Everyone knows all of my secrets.”
Only in the past few months has she begun to sign her posts with her full name and solidified a publishing deal. The resulting book is set to be released in June by HarperCollins. It will be a mix of new content that she hasn’t posted online and the original poems from her Instagram account. Some of these, particularly the earlier ones, are graphic, alluding to depression and self-harm. Kaufman, despite “not being in the same place that [she] was five years ago,” keeps the posts intact on her Instagram as a visual timeline of her recovery.
“I’ve gotten so many messages from people that are like, ‘I’m where you were three years ago, and I’m not where you were four years ago… That progression gives me hope.’” She hopes that her readers “find solace” in her account, and because of this mission, she doesn’t sugarcoat her life.
“I’m not a happy sunshine person all the time,” she says. “I want to be as open and honest as I possibly can be, because I know that there are so many other people out there who are looking for that and need that.”
When she was struggling with mental illness, she says she had no one to talk to about her feelings. She would watch YouTube videos of Demi Lovato “over and over and over again,” she says, hoping  that “if I watched them enough times, it felt like maybe she was talking to me.”
Her candor around her mental illness and her bisexuality encouraged her friends to do the same. Once she opened up to her friends, she found that many of them were also in therapy and were also struggling with mental illness. They “were okay talking about this stuff after one person just made the decision to start talking about it. And then suddenly everyone was talking about it,” she says.
With all of the buzz around the upcoming book, Kaufman’s confidence has grown. Recently, she has shared photos of herself, including a photo taken at last year’s NYC Pride, which would have been unthinkable when she started the account. She recalls that as a 14-year-old, “I would have been terrified if you had told me, ‘One day a picture of you is going to get like 8,000 likes on the Internet and hundreds of people will comment on it.’”
This new transparency is important to Kaufman because her poetry is ultimately about human connection, an interest that also motivates her in a different direction—towards a career in medicine.
For Kaufman, there’s nothing paradoxical about this. “Medically treating people is a form of human connection,” she explains. Dissecting a body, setting a broken bone, holding a human heart: “That’s poetic.”

Drew Gilpin Faust is preparing to step down as the 28th president of Harvard University on June 30, 2018, thus prompting whispers about who the next president may be.
But a president is more than just a “Who.” A president is a “What”—an accumulation of actions and deeds and doings that define the office and the person who holds it. In a time with so much talk about who the next president will be, it is logical to wonder: Do people actually know what the president of Harvard does?
Fueled by the flames of investigative inquiry, I took to the bustling dining halls of Adams, Leverett, and Flyby. Pen, paper, and Windows phone in hand, I set out to solicit honest impressions from those most affected (maybe?) by the actions of the President of Harvard: Harvard students themselves.
Tuesday afternoon. Lunchtime. In the hustle and bustle of the first weeks of classes, I sit at a table to search for some answers.
Mirielle E. Wright ’21 has some to offer. “Perhaps she does appearances on behalf of Harvard,” she says.  “You know. If there are events, she will go to them.”
And go to them, she has. President Faust has gone to events in Singapore, events in Sanders Theater, and events in the District of Columbia. In March of 2008, she gave testimony before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions about stagnant funding for the National Institutes of Health—an event if there ever was one.
She testified that “Leading scientists with quality grant proposals are caught in a protracted grant review process that plays out often over years, not months.” This is one of several instances of Faust’s event attendance, so Wright makes an accurate, if vague, assertion. Other students proposed more general answers to the question.
“I don’t think they’ve ever explained anything to us about what exactly she does,” Edgar Gonzalez Jr. ’19 says. He goes on to suggest that the President is the spokesperson of the University and deals with administrative and financial issues, though he does qualify his statements by adding, “I really have no clear idea what exactly she does.”
He was not the only one unsure of the duties of the president. “Honestly, I don’t know, I mean, she obviously writes all those little short news updates to everyone. That’s a big thing,” James N. Swingos ’20 says. “I’m sure there’s a lot of management going on.”
Indeed, President Faust’s management created the Steering Committee on Common Spaces, which brought the vibrantly colored Luxembourg chairs to Harvard Yard. This was a transformation that created “a new way of experiencing an iconic space,” as President Faust told in the The Boston Globe in 2012.
Faust also oversaw the launching of the Harvard Campaign, which has raised over eight billion dollars since 2013.
Still, students are not confident in their impressions of what the Harvard Presidency entails.
“I’m not really sure... I feel like the president is maybe the face of the university in a sense. I think [President Faust] probably has a great time,” Tyler F. Moulton ’20 says. “She probably does her best.”
That she does.
On a gusty October day in 2007, speaking at her inauguration as Harvard’s president, Faust remarked that “Inaugural speeches are a peculiar genre. They are by definition pronouncements by individuals who don’t yet know what they are talking about.”
More than a decade later, I imagine that President Faust knows what she is talking about. I imagine that she knows what the president of Harvard does. She has raised the money, traveled the globe, and managed the purchasing of the chairs. And perhaps, when we soon find ourselves with a new President of Harvard, we will soon find ourselves with a new answer to the unrelentingly enigmatic question: “What does the President of Harvard do?”

As Boston Mayor Marty J. Walsh shuffles down the stairs on Feb. 3, 2018, pausing every other step or so in order to shake someone’s hand, a Chinese woman in a bright pink fleece pushes past me. She squints at her phone screen for a moment before commencing a rapid-fire sequence of picture-taking—a stop motion animation of Mayor Marty Walsh Descending a Staircase. I watch as she scrolls through the last dozen pictures on her phone of Mayor Walsh’s chin and right elbow. She smiles in satisfaction before pushing back into the crowd.
For more than 60 years, Chinatown has lacked a public library. The neighborhood’s Tyler Street library building was torn down in 1956. Ever since, the Chinatown branch of the 24-branch Boston Public Library system (proudly touted as having “pioneered public library service in America”) has never made a permanent return. According to David Leonard, the president of Boston Public Library, there have been bookmobiles, pop-up libraries, and reading rooms in the past. However, there has never been an opening like this: the lower level of the China Trade Center, “Boston Public Library — Free to All” marked on the walls and windows, is overflowing with balloons, cameras, young women playing dulcimers, and people of all ages and ethnicities in colored puffers.

“It’s so great to see so many people. It’s very clear that we need a bigger library,” jokes long-term Chinatown Library activist Stephanie Fan during her speech at the ribbon-cutting ceremony.
“Take notes!” someone yells from the crowd.
After decades of activism, the Chinatown Library finally has a place to call its own. Starting Feb. 5, 2018, the Boston Public Library will be offering free Wi-Fi, laptops for use on-site, books and DVDs in English and Chinese, and a bilingual staff. But in this moment, during the grand opening of the Chinatown Boston Public Library, the focus is on the celebration.
“This is government at work doing really good things with the community, so I’m just really thrilled,” Leonard says.
When Mayor Walsh takes the podium during the ribbon-cutting ceremony, though, it becomes abundantly clear that this grand opening could not have been possible without decades of work from the community. This consisted of years of frustration, patience, and collaboration with individuals old and young as well as organizations big and small. In establishing the long-awaited Chinatown Library, Mayor Walsh made good on a promise from his mayoral race.
“People fighting for the last 25 years shows that it was important to the community, so it was important to me that we brought the service back,” Walsh tells FM.
Still, his speech is a never ending list of personalized Thank You’s. He especially thanks “the young people” during his speech, who are all “about two feet taller than they were when I first met them.” As volunteers help an elderly activist off stage, it is clear that the establishment of the Chinatown Library has been a community effort that has spanned generations.
Even after immense collaborative effort, this grand opening is still not for the permanent library. In the past year, the city has been conducting program study for a “longer term permanent solution.”
“Over the coming months, we’ll be taking the conversation to the next step,” Leonard says.
However, the community remains determined and optimistic for the future of the Chinatown Library.
“Boston has so many communities and I think a lot of people can understand how hard it can be for any particular community to get its needs met, because there is just so much constituency,” says Jeff Lao, member of the Chinese Youth Initiative. “It’s been a while, and it should’ve been way sooner, and we still have a lot of challenges, especially with housing and working issues… but more than a library, I think [this opening] is really a testament that when community members really want something, they can get it.”

“Wanna hear a joke?” Michael S. Dosmann asks. “I’ve never met-a-sequoia I didn’t like.”
Despite the morning chill, Dosmann, Keeper of the Living Collections at Harvard’s Arnold Arboretum, talks animatedly about the grove of unusually tall trees before us. His passion for living things is palpable. “The beauty about plants is that plants you can share,” he says. We’re standing, feeling small among these cousins of the redwood: Metasequoia Glyptostroboides, to be exact.
Dosmann points out the unique flame-shaped silhouette of the metasequoia—also known as the dawn redwood—and its ascendant branches. Touching the bark, he describes the fluted trunk as “almost muscly.”
“It reminds me of an Ent,” he jokes, citing the tree-men of ‘The Lord of the Rings.’ “Actually, it picks itself up and walks around at night, and shows up here at dawn.”
I could believe it. These towering trees—upwards of 200 feet tall—possess an air of myth. Standing at the Arboretum’s entrance, they could very well be its guardians, protecting against the city’s slow encroachment.
The Metasequoia Glyptostroboides has not always made its home in Boston. In fact, we should be grateful it has a home at all: in 1941, the world thought it extinct. And it might have remained that way, if not for the Arnold Arboretum’s intervention.
First discovered via fossil record in Japan, the Metasequoia genus was thought to be a relic of the Miocene. Over the next five years, though, specimens of an unknown tree—locally termed the ‘water-fir’—were recorded by Chinese scientists in Hubei Province, China. Their connection with the newly discovered fossil had not yet been made.
Hu Xiansu of the Fan Memorial Institute of Biology in Beijing, along with Wan-Chun Cheng of the National Central University in Nanjing, were the first to identify the ‘water-fir’ of Hubei Province as a species of the long-lost Metasequoia genus. Hu graduated Harvard with a Ph.D. and returned to China in 1925. “A number of the founding botanists in China were actually trained here at Harvard University, so it’s a long running collegial collaborative relationship,” Dosmann says.
Tapping into the momentum surrounding the discovery of this “living fossil,” the Arnold Arboretum funded Chinese scientists’ collection and preservation of these precious seeds. The venture was a success. The scientists collected and sent about one kilogram of seeds back to Harvard for safekeeping.
“The Arnold Arboretum was key and central in acting as an interlocutor,” Dosmann says. “The material came into the Arnold Arboretum, and then we took those parcels and packets of seeds and subdivided those to share with the world.” Over 600 packets of seeds made their way to a diverse set of universities and botanical institutions.
A grove of these trees took root in the Arboretum in 1948. Boston and China share a continental climate—Dosmann describes China’s climate as “magic”—which means that flora thriving in China tend to thrive here, too. This coincidence of weather fostered a deep academic relationship between universities in rival nations through the Cold War.
“It was a tough time to be in China: the Revolution was going on, it was the end of World War II, and we hadn’t had any of our botanists there for a decade or so,” Dosmann says. The metasequoia was reason enough to renew those ties.
Founded in 1872, the Arnold Arboretum is an international center of botanical collaboration. Celebrating the “comprehensive nature” of the collection’s catalogue, Dosmann says, “We’re one of the most celebrated arboreta on earth because of that diversity.”
The history of the Metasequoia Glyptostroboides is representative of the Arboretum’s mission to educate and conserve. “The metasequoia is in our DNA,” says Dosmann. In fact, the tree which appears on the Arboretum’s crest is none other than the dawn redwood itself.
Dosmann notes the Arboretum’s continued international efforts, citing in particular its work with the Chinese Union of Botanical Gardens.
“We’ve actually just instituted an exchange program so that one or two younger professionals working in the gardens there can come over here and spend some time learning about what we do with respect to horticulture, arboriculture, plant collections management and curation. And then they can go back to apply [that knowledge] to some of their collections.”
“Harvard University has been working and collaborating with scholars in China for a long time, and some of the longest running relationships are actually with the Arnold Arboretum, going back over a century,” he adds. Dosmann returned from an expedition to Sichuan Province this past fall, marking his eighth trip to China.
The purpose of his most recent trip was to seek out rare plants. But the metasequoia is never far from the spotlight.
“People still talk about it, because it really is an exemplar of collaboration, of discovery,” he continues, as we stare up the trunk through the (now bare) branches.
Set against the bone-white winter sky, the trees’ reddish bark is striking. This particular tree was grown from the original 1948 seeds, Dosmann says; it’s difficult to imagine that this giant could once have fit in the palm of my hand.
“Maybe even among all of Harvard University’s collections, [the Arnold Arboretum] is the most significant of its kind. There’s an amazing natural history museum at Harvard, beautiful glass flowers and things like that, but one might not say that that’s the most significant natural history collection on earth,” Dosmann says. “The art museums are fantastic, but you gotta say, is that better than the Met, or the Louvre?”
With the Arboretum’s 98 metasequoia and roughly 15,000 plants in-ground, his point falls on fertile ground.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Institute for Global Law and Policy at Harvard Law School has partnered with the Thailand Institute of Justice to launch workshops focused on strengthening the rule of law and sustainable development around the world.
The most recent collaboration, held in Bangkok last month, comprised three sessions designed for faculty and scholars titled “TIJ Workshop for Emerging Leaders on the Rule of Law and Policy,” “IGLP Workshop for Scholars,” and “Student Workshop for Next-Gen Global Leaders.”
The workshops covered topics like the evolution of law, economic policy regulation, and social governance. While attending the initiatives, an international cohort of scholars and faculty discussed new ways of solving issues related to ongoing legal and policy debates throughout Asia.
Law School professor David W. Kennedy, who serves as the director of the Institute for Global Law and Policy, said both institutes—at Harvard and in Thailand—bring something to the table in developing legal education around the world.
“They [TIJ] offer their own programs and workshops for emerging leaders from the region and we [IGLP] provide them with some of the curriculum and offer them some of our faculty to help them implement their workshops,” Kennedy said. “It’s a two way street.”
Founded in 2009, the Institute for Global Law and Policy works to develop new approaches to international law that can be used to tackle potential legal conflicts. Part of the institute’s mission is to facilitate international dialogue with academics around the globe.
Established by the Royal Thai government in 2011, The Thailand Institute of Justice is a semi-private organization that  promotes the rule of law through research on crime prevention and criminal justice.
“The Institute for Justice is very committed to strengthening the rule of law and governmental accountability in the area in which it works and we join them in that,” Kennedy said.
This year more than 120 people from 51 different countries were selected to attend the workshops, according to Kittipong Kittayarak, the executive director of the Thailand Institute of Justice, who also serves as the permanent secretary of Thailand’s Ministry of Justice.
Kennedy underscored the importance of collaborative thinking.
“We need new ideas and ideas matter for global governance,” Kennedy said. “We can’t think of them all on our own here, so what we need to do is engage people around the world who are thinking in new ways.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As it enters its fifteenth year of operation, the Medical School’s New Research Building is long past new but has yet to be named after a donor or prominent graduate.
The building, located on the Medical School’s Longwood Campus in Boston, cost $260 million when it was completed in 2003.
This New Research Building is not Harvard’s first. In 1992, Harvard opened a $57 million facility with the same moniker, though that building earned a real name the next year in recognition of a $20 million gift from New York businessman Warren Alpert. While parts of the current New Research Building have been named after Medical School affiliates, the building itself still retains its original placeholder designation despite over a decade of use.
At the time, it was the largest structure Harvard had ever built, measuring 525,000 square feet. More than 800 researchers work inside the building, which houses the Medical School’s genetics department and the department of microbiology and immunobiology. It also contains a fitness center, café, courtyard, and auditorium. Chairs in the auditorium can be named for a $10,000 donation to the school.
Philanthropy experts say that there are multiple reasons why a large building on a university campus could remain nameless for an extended period of time.
Bob Carter, chairman of a Florida-based fundraising consulting firm, said the University might be waiting to name the building after a donor who could help fund renovations or other funding needs.
“They must be in the hunt somewhere for a name,” he said.
He explained the easiest time to secure a name for a new building falls before construction is finished, given this allows the university to lure donors with the prospect of groundbreaking research taking place at a facility named in their honor.
Carter also said it is possible the Medical School could not find a donor “at the right level." The cost of emblazoning your name on a building typically comprises half the price of construction, he said.
The University’s website offered to sell naming rights to the building for $50 million in 2013 and 2014, but this opportunity no longer appears on the list of naming opportunities.
Gene R. Tempel, former dean of Indiana University’s Lilly School of Philanthropy, said it used to be common practice for universities to name buildings after donors. He added, though, that there has been a slight shift away from the custom in recent years.
“Among younger donors today, there’s just a lot less interest in naming buildings than there was [previously],” he said.
In an emailed statement, Harvard spokeswoman Gina Vild did not give a reason for the building's 15-year unnamed status. Instead, she pointed to several gifts the school has received in recent years as well as the Medical School's fundraising success as part of its capital campaign.
As of December, the school had achieved 96% of its fundraising goal of $750 million, which has been used to establish the HMS Center for Primary Care, The Bertarelli Program in Translational Neuroscience and Neuroengineering, and the Evergrande Center for Immunologic Disease among other things.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boston’s urban planning agency will pursue a large-scale study of Allston transit in response to locals’ concerns about new transportation development and traffic congestion.
The planned short-term and long-term study will address concerns about traffic flow and propose alternative transportation models, particularly in the face of upcoming development plans in Allston—including Harvard's.
The University officially filed plans to expand its campus into Allston in Dec. 2017; its science and engineering complex is scheduled to open in the fall of 2020. During an Allston community meeting last month, residents shared their worries that the University’s plans “hugely privileged” vehicular over pedestrian transit, adding pressure to an already strained transit system.
Gerald Autler, a senior project manager at the Boston Planning and Development Agency,  first brought up the idea of a transit study at an Allston community meeting in January. The BPDA decided at a Monday meeting, though, to split up the proposed study into separate short-term and long-term reviews. The short-term study will be completed in conjunction with Massachusetts Department of Transportation.
According to Autler, the short-term study aims to examine opportunities for transit improvement in the near future and during the upcoming development of West Station—a proposed commuter rail station connecting Allston to downtown Boston and the surrounding area. In Jan. 2018, Harvard pledged $50 million to fund approximately half the costs of the station.
“There’s huge amounts of developmental potential, but [Allston] lacks the richness of transit resources you see in some other parts of the city,” Autler said.
“I think people see that in order to see the area realize its full potential in terms of development—which means housing and jobs and neighborhoods for the city—we need to address these transportation challenges, and we need to address them in the shorter-term and longer-term,” he added.
Autler said the short-term study will examine ways to improve existing transit options and alleviate traffic pressures. In particular, the study will focus on bus lines, Autler said
“Some of the things we want to look at include tweaking existing bus lines,” he said. “Maybe the start point and the endpoint can be changed so that they are more effectively serving community populations.”
Autler also proposed the upcoming transit study at several recent town meetings as a way to address the ongoing transportation concerns of local residents.
Harry E. Mattison, an Allston resident, said he agrees something must be done to address traffic problems in the neighborhood.
“Transportation in Allston is big mess, and it’s only getting worse as Harvard and other people develop, and as more people are brought in everyday,” he said.
At the same time, Mattison said he is weary of city organizations conducting transportation studies. He said Allston has been the subject of several such reviews, including ones in 1998 and 2009, and that he thinks these studies have not led to concrete results.
“I think it’s nice that the city is doing a study, but Allston is a regional traffic bottleneck today, and it’s getting worse and worse, so we need to do more than just to study things,” he said.
Mattison said he would like the BPDA to release more concrete details about the study.
“What Allston residents and I want is details, something in writing with real timelines and commitments in funding both in study and implementation—and before we have that, there’s not a whole lot much judgement that can be passed,” he said.
Mattison suggested short-term solutions, like adding bicycle paths, that the city of Boston could implement to assist with the growing transit problems and alleviate current stress.
“There are things that could be done this month. There are things that could be done that we’ve been talking about for years,” Mattison said. “Allston is sort of just the innocent bystander caught in the middle of the traffic jam.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks after the Undergraduate Council transitioned to an anonymous voting system for most pieces of legislation, representatives say the change means they can more freely vote their conscience, even if it may lead to less transparency.
Under the new system, each representative votes for resolutions, motions, and amendments with an electronic clicker. While the electronic system used by the UC does allow for vote tracking, UC Secretary Jackson C. Walker ’21 said the votes of individual members of the Council will not be tracked.
The clickers will replace hand and voice votes, which comprised the primary voting methods for most legislation last year, according to Council Rules Committee Chair Wilfried J. Zibell ’21.
Roll-call voting can still be employed if motioned for by a Council member and agreed to by a one-fourth vote of the body, Zibell said. In addition, certain votes—including constitutional amendments and changes to bylaws—will use roll-call votes, per UC policy.
Representatives said they largely support the anonymous voting method compared to hand and voice votes because they feel reduced pressure to conform with the majority.
“I think that this new clicker voting system has made it even more comfortable for people to vote independently and to kind of think their own mind,” said Sruthi Palaniappan ’20, a Winthrop House Representative.  “I have seen a few instances where maybe people are influenced by what they see around them in terms of hand votes.”
Some Council members acknowledged, though, that the new system may decrease the transparency of the UC as a whole.
“I think that it’s important to be responsible to our constituents, the people who voted for us,” Zibell said.  “I would much prefer if...voting records were made public, and I think that taking votes you can be held accountable to is something that’s very important.”
Lowell House Representative Michael Scherr ’20 argued that floor debates before voting will allow observers to maintain a “pulse” on the Council and that the benefits of the anonymous system far outweigh the costs.
“It's not as if, if a representative feels strongly one way or the other, people won't know about it,” Scherr said.  “It's more those people who were torn in between are now going to be empowered to vote where they want to vote.”
As secretary, Walker is responsible for deciding whether or not a piece of legislation has the requisite number of votes to pass.  He said the electronic system will provide more precise vote totals and will prevent unnecessary counting errors. While individual members’ votes will not be tracked under the new system, the vote totals will remain publicly available on the UC website.
In an emailed statement, UC President Catherine L. Zhang ’19 defended the new voting system.
“Prior to using electronic voting, the only votes that would be placed on the public record were roll call votes,” Zhang wrote.  “Electronic voting gives us the exact number of council members who vote "Aye,” "Nay,” and "Oye.”
“Making these numbers public is just one of the many initiatives we are doing to follow-through on our promise of transparency,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Graduate School of Education surpassed its $250 million capital campaign fundraising goal in March 2017, according to the school's Senior Associate Dean for Development and Alumni Relations Daphne N. Layton.
Harvard’s University-wide capital campaign launched in Sept. 2013, with each of the individual schools kicking off their own fundraising efforts, too. As of June 2017, the University had  raised $8 billion, shattering its original $6.5 billion fundraising goal.
The School of Education campaign amassed contributions from over 8,000 donors, 81 percent of whom are alumni of the school. Layton noted, though, that—because most School of Education graduates are educators—gifts from alumni represent only 3 percent of the total dollars raised in the campaign.
“Three quarters of our campaign total comes from foundations and individual donors outside Harvard who are supporting our faculty and our strategic initiatives because they believe HGSE will cultivate the leaders and innovators the field needs, and generate new knowledge to solve education’s most pressing problems,” Layton wrote in an emailed statement.
Layton attributed most of the campaign’s success to the leadership of Dean James E. Ryan, the work of the school's research centers and faculty, and the “passion and potential” of Graduate School of Education students.
“The funds we have raised during the campaign have enabled the launch of many new initiatives that further HGSE’s mission and extend our impact in the world,” Layton wrote.
Though the campaign has been a success for the School of Education, it has also had to overcome unique challenges specific to the school.
“It is correspondingly hard to find donors who will give the institution unrestricted funds, or gifts for core priorities like faculty chairs, financial aid, and facilities—which ultimately are critical to our ability to thrive in the long term,” Layton wrote.
Regardless of the school's success in the capital campaign, Layton said the School of Education still has unmet needs—particularly related to student financial aid and endowed professorships—and plans to continue fundraising past the campaign’s conclusion in June 2018.
Fernando M. Reimers, a professor of international education at the School of Education, agreed the institution still has a ways to go in achieving its mission for the future.
“The school has ambitious goals to meet and a very important mission to advance the field of education. To do this we need more resources for financial aid, research, and translating the research of our faculty into resources which influence policy and practice,” Reimers wrote in an email. “So, if the question is what do we need to realize our full potential as a school? The answer is a four letter word: MORE.”

UPDATED: February 8, 2018 at 4:32 p.m.
As soon as she took office, University President Drew G. Faust wanted to make something clear.
“I’m not the woman president of Harvard. I’m the president of Harvard,” Faust proclaimed at a news conference held the afternoon of her confirmation as the University’s 28th president.
The statement reflected her determination early on to make clear her presidency would be more than just a nod to gender equity.
Reflecting on those words 11 years later, Faust said she did not—and still does not—think she should be considered a “special category.”
“The way it came to sit in my mind was, there are various sports records where somebody gets an asterisk because they have this many home runs but it was a longer season, or there’s some special dispensation so it doesn’t really count—I didn’t want to be the president with an asterisk,” Faust said in an interview in Dec. 2017. “I want to be as powerful, as effective, as respected, taken as seriously, as any man.”
Nonetheless, after more than a decade at Harvard’s helm, Faust—who announced last summer she will step down this June—sees her role a bit differently. Given white men had occupied the University's highest office for 371 years prior to her selection, Faust said she soon realized her appointment held a special significance for girls and women around the world. She realized being the "woman president" didn’t necessarily mean relinquishing her authority.
"It became very clear to me when I started getting all these letters from girls all around the world about how much it meant that I was president of Harvard, and I thought there’s a special responsibility for me here to demonstrate that this is possible,” Faust said in December. “I wanted to be the president of Harvard, but I recognized that there was this kind of parallel track where I was being the woman president of Harvard in a way that mattered.”
From then on, Faust made a point of visiting girls’ schools when traveling internationally, according to Christine M. Heenan, who worked closely with Faust as the former Vice President for Harvard Public Affairs and Communications for six years.
“In Beijing, in Tokyo, in Africa, she would speak about leadership and about believing in yourself and about aspiring to what you want to do and she did that very seriously,” Heenan said.
Throughout her presidency, Faust has placed considerable emphasis on equality of opportunity, which, according to Heenan, stems partly from her upbringing as the only girl among her brothers.
“She grew up both experiencing opportunities that were open to the males in her family that weren’t open to her, but also knowing how to navigate in a world dominated by men," Heenan said. “She came away from that both with a sense of the opportunity that had yet to be unlocked through creating more opportunity for women and also with a lot of skill and aplomb in how to navigate in a world dominated by men.”
From her Massachusetts Hall office, Faust has made a concerted effort to increase the diversity of the student body, expand the University’s financial aid program, and advocate for undocumented students under the Trump administration.
Helen Haste, a visiting professor of Education at the Graduate School of Education, said that Faust’s “forward-looking” vision brought the University into the 21st century.
“I think Professor Faust brought Harvard into that kind of world where issues of contemporary and social importance were discussed openly and addressed and I think she’s done a great job of that,” Haste said.
Faust recalls the world of academia she stepped into as a young professor at the University of Pennsylvania in 1975 as one marked by “repartée and assumptions” about women that Faust likened to those in the television series “Mad Men.”
"People made remarks about women, people assumed things about women, and it was a commitment that you had to affirmatively have to kind of maintain your dignity in the face of that,” Faust said.
Four decades later, widespread allegations of workplace harassment have brought enduring gender power imbalances to the fore. Sexual harassment allegations have taken down powerful men in the media, government, and corporate worlds. The stream of accusations, which began with allegations against Hollywood titan Harvey Weinstein in Oct. 2017, catalyzed the social media campaign asking women to post stories of sexual harassment with the hashtag #MeToo.
Though the field has changed quite a bit since the beginning of Faust’s career, academia, too, has seen some effects of the #MeToo movement, albeit muffled ones.
Harvard saw a 20 percent increase in sexual harassment complaints filed with Office of Dispute Resolution in the wake of the Weinstein scandal, according to University Title IX administrators. Alongside that uptick, the University is currently facing three separate Title IX investigations from the federal government. The cases stem from complaints filed with the US Department of Education’s Office of Civil rights in 2014, 2016, and 2017, alleging that various Title IX offices at the University mishandled sexual harassment claims in ways that amount to sex discrimination.
In a University-wide email sharing an annual report by the Office of Dispute Resolution and the Title IX Office on sexual assault prevention and response in Dec. 2017, Faust brought up the #MeToo movement and condemned sexual harassment.
“Sexual harassment and sexual assault degrade human dignity, and they have no place at Harvard. The powerful forces of presumption and hierarchy shape our lives and our communities in profound ways,” Faust wrote. “Over the past few months, this reality has been underscored by revelation after revelation of sexual misconduct by individuals across the country, and we have witnessed an unprecedented movement on social media and elsewhere to share experiences, seek support, and pursue justice.”
More recently, at a Faculty meeting Tuesday, Faust emphasized the importance of using available resources on campus and urging “members of our community to both speak and listen.”
“With the emergence of the #MeToo movement, we’ve been made highly aware of how widespread incidents of sexual harassment are,” Faust said. “Sexual harassment violates fundamental values of justice and fairness. It threatens our efforts to build an environment where everyone can learn and flourish.”
Some hypothesize that academia’s entrenched hierarchies help explain the #MeToo movement’s relatively muted manifestation to date, given they can inhibit women from speaking out and can help hide harassers.
“I think in a way, harassers can hide better here, because the power structures are so deeply embedded,” History of Science and Women, Gender, and Sexuality lecturer Leena M. Akhtar told Fifteen Minutes, The Crimson's magazine.
Yet Harvard has made strides toward mitigating gender disparities under Faust, according to Judith D. Singer, the Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity. Singer said Faust’s work on gender issues began well before she stepped into Massachusetts Hall.
During her years as the dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Faust made improving the status of women at the University a priority. And Singer said Faust worked to establish the Radcliffe Institute not only as a place for advanced study, but also as a forum for celebrating women in the United States.
“That has been part of her research agenda and part of her administrative agenda for her entire time at Harvard,” Singer said.
Prior to her presidency, Faust oversaw the efforts of two campus task forces on women in 2005: one University-wide group and another focused on science and engineering. Those committees recommended creating Singer’s office, funding for recruitment programs, and enacting substantial changes to childcare support and maternity leave policies.
The Faculty Development and Diversity Office now runs recruitment and talent-spotting training programs with Harvard’s various schools. The University also now spends over $1 million each year on subsidizing childcare costs for its faculty and has policies providing parental leave to both male and female employees, according to Singer. And Harvard has created a procedure for making tenure track extensions available to individuals who must take parental leave.
“As the chair of the task forces on women, she put in place even before she was president a whole set of activities in motion that when she became president she was able to continue,” Singer said. “It is a quite clear part of her agenda to diversify the faculty both with respect to gender and with respect to race and ethnicity.”
Only 20 percent of tenured faculty were women at the start of Faust’s presidential term; today, that proportion has grown to just under 26 percent of tenured faculty, according to a 2017 Faculty Development and Diversity office publication. Forty percent of faculty members on the tenure track are women.
The standing of women at Harvard has changed noticeably beyond just the numbers, Singer said. She recalled a conversation she once had with a longtime male dean at the University.
“He used to think that when he walked into a room and there were a lot of women in the room, this wasn’t a seat of power,” she said. “When President Faust became president, he realized that if he walked into a room and there weren’t some women in the room, he wasn’t in a seat of power. That’s a real shift.”
Despite this progress, significant gaps in female leadership at the University remain. Only two of Harvard’s 15 deans are female, and only 5.4 percent of tenured faculty and 13.6 percent of tenure-track faculty of are women of color. Some women faculty members report they still feel disadvantaged on the tenure track and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has struggled with the phenomenon of women professors leaving the University.
In Nov. 2016, some professors prepared an internal report showing the retention rate for women faculty in science, engineering, and mathematics departments at Harvard is almost 20 percent lower than it is for male faculty.
Still, Singer said she thinks Faust’s presidency will have a lasting impact on the University’s quest for gender parity.
“She’s leaving a different Harvard,” Singer said. “There’s nothing like having a woman at the top to say that women can lead.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification:
CLARIFICATION: February 8, 2018
A previous version of this story indicated that the University provides maternity leave to both male and female employees. To clarify, Harvard provides parental leave to both male and female employees.

As Harvard nears the completion of its record-setting capital campaign, Dean of the Kennedy School Douglas W. Elmendorf reported the school has raised more than $660 million, though he said he will continue to prioritize fundraising for financial aid.
By March 2017, the Kennedy School had raised roughly $580 million, surpassing its original $500 million goal. The University-wide capital campaign is set to end in June 2018, but Elmendorf said the school needs more money for its financial aid program to ensure that HKS programs are accessible to students from all income backgrounds.
“For all of the progress we made, we still have talented people who have trouble affording to come here so we want to make that possible,” Elmendorf said.
In the last few years, the Kennedy School made major renovations to its campus and added 40 new fellowship programs as a result of its fundraising efforts, according to Elmendorf.
“The Campaign for Harvard Kennedy School is allowing us to expand financial aid for our students, enhancing our student recruiting efforts and allowing our graduates more opportunities to choose public service as their career path,” Kennedy School spokesperson Doug Gavel wrote in an email.
Gavel wrote that 52 percent of Kennedy School students currently receive financial aid.
In 2017, the University raised $1.28 billion, surpassing all other American universities for the second straight year. Since the campaign launched in 2013, the initiative has raked in over $8 billion, as of last June.
While Kennedy School students said they support an expansion of the program, they added they want further reforms including fully-funded scholarships.
Thomas B. Stephens, a mid-career student pursuing a masters in public administration degree, said he was encouraged to apply for a Kennedy School fellowship after accepting his admission offer to Harvard. Even after winning the Native American Public Service Fellowship, though, Stephens said he needed to sell his house in order to have enough money to cover living expenses while at Harvard.
“I was prepared and did sell my house in the process to have enough money to come to Harvard—but in the process I received the fellowship,” Stephens said. “The fellowship does not cover everything.”
While Stephens said he was fortunate to have the financial support of his tribal government to fully fund him during his time at the Kennedy School, many students do not have the same financial support. Many students, he said, have to take out loans to afford their schooling—and the Kennedy School offers to help students repay educational loans.
“The Dean remains committed to growing financial aid for our students through a variety of current and future fellowship and scholarship programs,” Gavel said.
Stephens said Kennedy School graduates often have difficulty repaying loans because of the typical salaries offered in public service work. He said he thinks students should ideally be spared this burden.
“I’m not going to be a rich man as far as financial capital,” Stephens said.

Following a new university endowment tax estimated to cut into Harvard’s endowment by over $40 million, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith said he will not commit to long-term projects for the time being.
Republican lawmakers passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December, with one provision requiring private colleges with an endowment greater than $500,000 per student to pay a 1.4 percent tax on annual endowment returns. Harvard is one of 35 institutions nationwide affected by the act. Administrators have estimated the University would have had to pay $44 million in taxes if the legislation had applied in fiscal year 2017.
Smith confirmed the new legislation will affect the budget of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, which receives almost half of its income from the endowment.
“It will have an impact on us,” Smith said. “It is taking money we could’ve used for academic programs, could've used for financial aid, could've used for a bunch of other things we try to accomplish here.”
According to Smith, administrators are still working to understand the bill’s impacts in detail. In the meantime, Smith said he plans to refrain from making “long-term commitments.”
“I just don't know how big of an impact this is going to be and how badly it's going to hit us. So we're trying to do things in the short term to continue to innovate and push our programs forward,” Smith said. “If you came in and asked me to commit a whole bunch of money for the next ten years, I'd say, 'Come back and talk to me in six months.'”
Other top administrators have spoken out against the bill. At a Faculty meeting on Tuesday, University President Drew G. Faust called the bill a cause for concern. She also wrote that the tax would affect the University’s ability to fund financial aid in a December emailed statement.
“The provision will constrain the resources that enable us to provide the financial aid that makes college more affordable and accessible and to undertake the inquiries that yield discoveries, cures, innovation and economic growth,” Faust wrote.
Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote in a November email to Harvard affiliates that an earlier version of the bill “would broadly reduce benefits that support higher education.”
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences funds several major endeavors, like an ongoing effort to renovate the College’s upperclassmen Houses, and also provides resources for Harvard's financial aid program. Recent lackluster endowment returns have constrained the division’s budgets.
According to last year’s FAS fiscal report, the endowment created a “larger than budgeted deficit once again.” This financial shortfall was one reason FAS has decided to slow down the House Renewal Project, Smith wrote in the report.
Smith did say on Wednesday, though, that the faculty is working to ensure that current ongoing projects like House renewal won’t be impacted.
“We’re committed to doing House renewal,” Smith said. “We're trying to figure out the best ways to make it work without doing something completely crazy that cuts into the financial aid system.”

After repeated reports of “vandalism, theft, and destruction of property,” Winthrop House administrators sent multiple emails to House residents condemning the perpetrators and warning of potential consequences.
Linda D. Chavers, Winthrop House resident dean, sent an email to students Sunday afternoon formally addressing the “recurring incidences [sic]” in the third floor bathrooms of Standish Hall, one of three residential halls within the house.
“This is unacceptable and just plain disappointing,” Chavers wrote. “It’s frustrating that anyone could be so disrespectful to our House staff. So I’ll remind you that this type of behavior is not going to be tolerated and can be grounds for formal discipline.”
Chavers also noted that the Harvard University Police Department had been contacted.
Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. and Stephanie Robinson, Winthrop’s faculty deans, sent a more extensive email to Winthrop residents Monday afternoon, citing other instances of “vandalism” to Standish Hall in addition to those in the third floor bathrooms. According to the email, unidentified perpetrators threw toilet paper out of the hall’s windows to litter the courtyard below and also stole a wetsuit from one of the restrooms.
“Never in our eight years serving as Masters and, then, Faculty Deans have we experienced the spate of disrespect to Winthrop House, its students, and their personal property,” Sullivan and Robinson wrote.  “The foregoing is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.”
Like Chavers, Sullivan and Robinson also mentioned that HUPD had been notified and added that disciplinary action would take place immediately if the responsible individuals do not come forward. The faculty deans gave the perpetrators, and those with knowledge of the incidents, 24 hours to speak up or face the revocation of housing privileges and referral to the Administrative Board, the College’s primary disciplinary body.
“If our investigation or that of HUDP [sic] uncovers the responsible parties or those with knowledge of the afore-described misdeeds, and those persons had not come forward on their own accord, we will immediately revoke your housing privileges and simultaneously refer the matter to the Administrative Board, with our strongest recommendation for sanctions," the Winthrop faculty deans wrote.
Standish Hall resident Jacob N. Russell ’19 said he heard about the events through the deans’ emails. He added he was surprised by the “strict” nature of the messages.
“Normally if you get an email from the House Master, it’s like ‘have a safe winter break,’ or something along those lines,” Russell said, referring to Sullivan and Robinson. “So it’s definitely pretty big to get an email from them just basically letting everyone know that this is unacceptable, and that HUPD will get involved if necessary.”
Russell also said that, given Winthrop House recently underwent renovation, “you would think that people treat it with a bit more respect.”
Fellow resident Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 said she saw the vandalism first-hand Sunday.
‘They had taken the bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and completely just squirted out everything that was in there,” Palaniappan said. “My retainer was gone, and my very expensive toothbrush was gone, and it didn’t seem necessary at all. It was very disappointing.”
Palaniappan also noted her house requires Winthrop-specific swipe access in multiple locations—perhaps offering a clue to the identity of the vandals.
"Maybe one of the members of the group, at least, [lives] in Winthrop," she said.

It came down to the wire in Ithaca on Saturday night.
With the game on the line, Harvard had the chance to cement a late win against the Big Red at the charity stripe. With 1:28 left on the clock and with the Crimson in the bonus, sophomore guard Justin Bassey was fouled on a pump fake just outside the three point line. The junior went to the line and made both shots to put Harvard up 72-69.
Following a block from the Crimson on the other end and a turnover from Bassey on offense, Cornell regained possession with just 40 seconds left on the clock. Sophomore forward Josh Warren got a favorable switch and dumped the ball off to junior forward Stone Gettings.
Gettings drove inside and was met by freshman forward Danilo Djuricic. Djuricic fouled the 6’9’’ forward, but his shot would fall to put the Big Red within a point at 72-71. With 30 seconds left on the clock, Gettings—who had done everything but miss on the night and already had a game-high 30 points—went to the line with a chance to tie the game.
After going a perfect 4-of-4 from the line up until that point, the junior bounced the free throw off the back iron and into the hands of Bassey.
The Crimson closed the game out shooting a perfect 4-of-4 from the charity stripe and a last second heave from Morgan wouldn’t find the back of the net as Harvard escaped 76-73.
“It’s always tough playing on the road in the league, so coming in we knew it would was going to be a tough one like it was last night,” sophomore forward Seth Towns said. “Last two minutes it was the same as it always is in crunch time, just coming out with the W, just being in the moment and getting it done.”
ON DEFENSE AND AT THE LINE
What began as an offensive effort from both squads ended with shots that were perhaps a bit easier to make. Through the first frame, Harvard shot an efficient 48 percent from the field and much like it did the night before, shot incredibly from deep—58 percent through the first 20 minutes.
For its part Cornell—and especially Gettings—made the shots the Crimson gave it early. Tasked with defending the versatile big man, Lewis struggled to meet the forward out on the perimeter and Gettings rained corner threes in the early going. With the Harvard defense collapsing on the pick and roll, the junior finished the first half with 14 points on 4-of-8 shooting from beyond the arc.
On the night, Gettings would finish with 32 points on 11-of-22 shooting from the field.
“[Gettings] is a very tough kid to guard because of his ball skills for his size,” head coach Tommy Amaker said. “It’s a hard matchup especially when he’s playing like the five man, so now we have our bigs who are traditionally interior guys trying to chase and guard him out on the perimeter and he’s as good with the ball as any of their perimeter players. Tremendous effort by that kid.”
The early offensive, however, gave way to a much slower second half. For a second night in a row, Harvard had to break a full court press for much of the second act. Much like it worked to slow the Crimson the night before, the press grounded Harvard in the early going of the second half.
The slower play gave way to a slew of fouls which would put both teams in the bonus early in the half. The late free throws would prove to be the deciding factor of the night. While Gettings’ late miss would cost the Big Red the game late, Cornell struggled from the line all night, going 10-of-18 from the charity stripe.
For its part, the Crimson missed from the free throw line just once—going a 15-of-16 from the line and a perfect 10-of-10 in the second frame.
“I just thought that we showed great composure and were incredibly efficient down the stretch offensively,” Amaker said. “Big shots by Seth and Danilo [Djuricic] and tremendous free throw shooting down the stretch. Very, very proud of that.”
TEAM PLAY
In a season that’s seen plenty of notable individual performances from players such as Towns, Lewis, and a now injured Bryce Aiken, Saturday’s win for Harvard came from an all-around balanced effort.
In total four different players scored in double digits, while sophomore Christian Juzang tied a career-high with 12 points.
“I’m really pleased with how [Juzang’s] been able to adopt the role he’s in now based on Bryce and Rio being a freshman,” Amaker said. “Christian is a guy that has to shoulder the responsibility of being our main quarterback and I’m very pleased with his growth and development at this stage.”
The sophomore also added a career-high six rebounds to go with three assists.
Despite the late press working to slow the Crimson’s offense, Harvard passed the ball well against the Cornell defense. In total Harvard assisted on 17 of its 25 made bucket with Towns chipping in a career-high six.
Coming off the bench, freshman forward Danilo Djuricic added 11 points on 4-of-6 shooting from the field

For a bunch of CS nerds, we have to applaud the HCS for their humorous content on this year's Datamatch survey. We don't think the laughs should be restricted only to Datamatch users, so we give you: Best of Datamatch 2k18.
We're saddened by how many Harvard students we expect to take full advantage of this feature.
We always knew the sole reason for frequenting LamCaf was to flirt (looking at you, freshmen).
And if you haven't been in the Crimson, that's a sign you should comp Flyby.

The only thing better than a strong LinkedIn presence is having a River Daddy.

What if we told you that people care about your love life almost as little as they care about Bitcoin?
So get out there, get Datamatching, and prove us all wrong: Love does exist at Harvard.

If you’re a freshman, the concept of Datamatch may not have been thoroughly explained to you. Actually, the concept of speaking to other people may also not have been thoroughly explained to you either. Luckily, we have multiple years of crippling loneliness and Valentine’s Day solitude under our belts and are passing our knowledge unto you.
What Datamatch Is
Datamatch is a college-wide distributed survey created by the Harvard Computer Society. Yes—the mechanism through which students find dates at this school is dependent on the Computer Society. Interpret that as you will. After answering a bunch of multiple choice questions regarding your life on Harvard, interests, blood type, Social Security number, etc., you send in your answers and wait eagerly by candlelight as an algorithm determines which human you’ll put on a decent outfit to go on a date with.
On Valentine’s Day, you’ll receive one or two matches, with the option to get a meal paid for by HCS with said match. The catch is that both your match and you must indicate that you’re down to get a meal together. Unrequited acceptances don’t work. It’s kind of like the ‘Hang the DJ’ episode of Black Mirror, except that Datamatch won’t mentally scar you. If both of you decide to engage in human interaction for the first time in your life, you’ll go on a (potentially) cute date and elope within the next few days.
If your desire to go out with your match is not reciprocated by them, I would recommend listening to ‘Drew Barrymore’ by SZA on loop to assist you in the weeklong crying session you’re going to embark on. I would also recommend using the Kleenex with Lotion tissues, as your nose will get less irritated as you cry more. I’m not saying this from personal experience. Okay, yes, I am. Why did you ignore me, Amanda….
What Datamatch Is Not
Datamatch is not a valid reason to tell your blocking group that you’re entering the dating market at Harvard. It does not justify spending $400 on a new wardrobe to get glammed out to go to Zinneken’s. It definitely is not the way to secure a lifelong commitment with that guy from your government section that you’re too anxious to say hi to. It’s not a serious, “business formal” approach to making connections at Harvard, which is a great thing. Mostly, it is not a way to tell your friends from home that you’re dating a gal from Harvard. If someone gave me the option to eat at Flour for free, I’d gladly take the opportunity to go, even if it was with a literal rabid hyena.
Datamatch is a great tradition at Harvard, and you should definitely give it a shot. Who knows—maybe you’ll actually enjoy your time with your match, and you two can remain friends...or fiancés. You may have to take a step out of your comfort zone, but that’s what college is all about. Heck, this is your chance to go to Clover and not feel bad for spending a rack on rosemary fries. So, get out there and have fun. Or don’t. Crying on Valentine’s Day is always an option too.
