After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thanksgiving is never perfect. (This year, our dining room table snapped in two at the end of it.) But it usually comes pretty close.
I always cite the fourth Thursday in November as my favorite holiday. That’s saying a lot—drawing from two religious hats, I have a fair number to choose from. My Jewish father brings the apples and honey, menorahs and dreidels, and maror and charoset into our home, and my Episcopalian mother places nativity scenes on the mantle place and chocolate eggs in the corners and cupboards.
I did my time in Hebrew Sunday School. I learned my aleph, bet, gimels and my echad, sh’nayim, shaloshes, all the while jamming along to such rollicking classics as Shalom Rav and L’chah Dodi. I even memorized a few aliyot about Moses and company trekking through the desert. Then I had a (Venice-themed!) party, and I called it quits. All those years, however, I felt more Jew-ish than Jewish. And I never missed a Christmas.
Perhaps my schizophrenic religious upbringing is what draws me to a holiday as unabashedly secular as Thanksgiving. After all, I used to see the two sides of my devotional background as diametrically opposed. (“My dad’s a Jew,” my five-year-old self, fresh out of a temple sermon on the Hannukah story, told my friends, “and my mom’s a Syrian.”) I don’t have to contemplate where my allegiances lie when Turkey Day rolls around. In Cranberry Sauce I Trust, and it’s much easier that way.
Or so I thought—until Thanksgivukkah. Count me as one of the many to contribute to the hullaballoo surrounding this rare and sacred holiday convergence. The solar and lunisolar Gregorian and Hebrew calendars, for semi-scientific reasons a humanities girl like me could never quite understand, rarely match up this perfectly. Thanksgiving and Hannukah last fell on the same day in 1888, and they will not cross paths again till 79,811, when their observers may all have perished from this earth. That’s why, in this hallowed year of 2013, American Jews must carpe diem (or carpe noctem, since Hannukah does not begin till after sundown), and celebrate.
I’m not entirely sure why Thanksgivukkah matters in the grand scheme of things, but it turns out to matter in the much humbler blueprint of my own life. Because when, full of turkey and happiness, I lit the candles on my menorah for the first time this year, I realized for the first time what similar roles Thanksgiving and Hannukah play for me. And along with that, I realized where religion really fits in my life.
On Thanksgiving, I love having my family all in one place. I love waking up to the smell of sausage stuffing cooking away. I love the way the marshmallows bubble on top of the sweet potato soufflé, fresh out of the oven. I love the chocolate turkeys my grandma purchases for the “kids” every year. I love still being a kid for the day. I love forcing everyone to go around the table, sharing what we’re thankful for, and I love feeling like I could go on listing things I love till I hit my word limit.
These things exist for Hannukah and Christmas, too. I can fry up a mean latke, gorge myself on glittering gelt, and watch the last candle on the menorah slowly burn down one month and stick a star on top of an evergreen, pick the marzipan mushrooms off the bûche de Noël, and read out loud from A Christmas Carol the next without betraying anyone or anything. I’m definitely thankful for that.
Religion isn’t only prayers. It’s not only adherence to certain rituals. It’s not even only faith in the existence of a higher power. Just like Thanksgiving, it’s also family, fun, and—very importantly—food. It’s community, and it’s culture. I don’t need to reconcile any doctrine (or, more accurately, to decide whether or not to tack a New Testament onto the Old) to figure that much out. And when it does come to a deity, He—sorry, or She—can be whoever or whatever I want to believe in.
So Happy Thanksgiving, Hannukah, and soon enough, Christmas.
And God bless us, every one.

How fun that members of a Senate that recently required a nuclear option to resuscitate itself are the chiders-in-chief of the breakthrough deal with Iran. Or that the only country to engage in nuclear warfare and that kept its nuclear launch codes set to “00000000" for 20 years leads world discussions on nuclear responsibility.
But hypocrisy in international relations is a field as fertile as any Afghan pomegranate orchard (with just as many land mines).
In the end, world peace is predicated on nuclear nonproliferation at a minimum and—most optimally—strategic arms reductions from existing nuclear powers. Consequently, the six-month Geneva accord between Iran and six world powers that makes it harder for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon by neutralizing its stockpile of uranium enriched at the 20 percent level, halting construction of its heavy water plant at Arak, and instituting regular IAEA inspections should be drawing considerable praise.
Not so. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced the accord as a “historic mistake.” Saudi Arabia petulantly declined a coveted seat on the UN Security Council last month and has been fulminating ever since the palpable thaw in U.S.-Iran relations after its election of the moderate President Hassan Rouhani. That’s not surprising—the presence of the Persian arch nemesis has been vital to the political success of Likud and the steady American support for King Abdullah.
Stateside, Senator Charles Schumer is pushing to levy additional sanctions against Iran—just to ensure that any tangible progress be immediately bulldozed. Schumer noted, “It was strong sanctions, not the goodness of the hearts of the Iranian leaders, that brought Iran to the table.” Well, yes. That sanctions incentivize desired actions by pulling on purse strings rather than heartstrings is a near tautological truth that should not come as an earth-shattering revelation to the good senator. The entire purpose of the sanctions is precisely to bring Iran to the negotiating table and move it away from developing a nuclear weapon—not to ensure the Iranian people’s perpetual languishment under severe economic sanctions.
At the very least, the Geneva accord brought about by unprecedented high-level contact between the Americans and Iranians—from a personal phone call between President Obama and President Rouhani in September to secret meetings in Oman mediated by Sultan Qaboos—is an improvement from the days when President Clinton had to wait around the UN building to chance a face-to-face meet with President Khatami, like a dejected high school suitor.
Iran has already begun allowing inspections of its heavy water production plant—and all signs indicate that the Islamic Republic has been acting in good faith. Then from where does all this tiger-footed rage come?
I’ve given up on the task of ascribing a rational basis to the congressional culture of counterproductivity—Peter’s Principle and Moore’s Law are the supreme laws of our supreme law-giving body. But the Saudi and Israeli histrionics reflect a more realistic anxiety over Middle East hegemony.
Straightforwardly, Iran’s reentry into the global financial system would stabilize its free-falling currency, inflation, and unemployment rates. And an Iran fully able to capitalize on its oil reserves would strengthen its position as the Shi’ite counter to the Sunni eminence pushed by Saudi, Qatari, and Emirati dollars.
But more saliently the Saudi fury signals a fear of the end of the world’s tolerance for Arab autocracies. Much of the objections to Iran revolve around words like “totalitarian” and “dictatorship” in describing the country’s government. And it’s true that the presidential elections are at best semi-democratic given the pre-approval required for presidential candidates by the powerful Guardian Council—to say nothing of the plenary power of the Supreme Leader. Granted, none of that might have happened had the United States not deposed the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in favor of the autocratic shah—but why not let bygones be bygones?
But the other side can’t make an especially compelling claim to democratic intent either. The United States, Saudi Arabia, and Israel made no such complaints with the long dictatorship of Hosni Mubarak and certainly have not embraced the Arab Spring with the open arms that supposed stalwarts of democracy would be expected to.
No—the Saudi fear is that the crumbling concept of the Axis of Evil will no longer leave it open to operate its autocratic monarchy with impunity. With the world’s eye no longer distracted by apocalyptic designs emanating from Tehran, Riyadh starts to pall before Western powers that must countenance the checkered Saudi human rights record with their stated goals of liberal democracies.
So don’t believe the hyperventilation over Iran. It is a tale full of sound and fury signifying nothing.

Thirty-two years after the first cases of AIDS were diagnosed, the epidemic is still not over. Tremendous progress has been made over the decades, as a disease initially shrouded in silence and stigma is now preventable and treatable. Due to incredible advances in medical research, bold action by advocates, patients, and doctors, and political commitment by governments around the world, we have begun the process of bringing this epidemic to an end. In recent years, however, our commitments have been stagnating, as global leaders make bold claims about the end of AIDS but fail to adequately fund treatment and prevention programs that could eradicate the disease.
Nearly 35 million people around the world are currently living with HIV/AIDS, but just barely half of those who need access to life-saving antiretroviral drugs have access. After 25 million deaths from AIDS, we finally have the tools to envision a day when there need not be another more. On World AIDS Day, December 1, two years ago, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton proclaimed that “an AIDS-free generation” is within sight. With another World AIDS Day this past Sunday, it is time to commemorate the lives lost. But it is also time to renew our commitment to the end of AIDS, not only with lofty words, but also with serious action to enact that vision.
In many regions of the world, infection rates continue to increase, but expansions in access to treatment are not keeping pace. Key populations at high risk especially lack adequate access to treatment. As precious time ticks by, international funding plateaus rather than rises to the occasion. This sense of complacency comes at a time not only when moral prerogative demands action, but also when scientific evidence has proven that now is the time to act. A landmark study published in 2010 showed that providing early treatment to people living with AIDS can reduce transmission rates by 96 percent. Placing people on treatment early and widely is in itself an effective means of prevention. We have further scientific knowledge and technology at our disposal, such as rapid testing. We have turned AIDS into a chronic illness rather than a definite death sentence. What we need now is a decisive push to ensure that people who need treatment are able to receive it.
Two weeks ago, in a welcome display of bipartisan solidarity, Congress unanimously passed a bill to reauthorize the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. This ensures that the program itself, which has placed 6 million people on treatment and funded prevention and care programs for people living with AIDS since 2003, will continue to exist for the next five years. While this ensures the continuation of PEPFAR, it does not guarantee that PEPFAR will be adequately funded. It is not the divisive political climate of Congress that threatens to stall the fight against AIDS, but rather the Obama administration. Even with unanimous agreement from Congress that ending AIDS must remain a priority of the United States, the President remains hesitant to commit to a treatment target that will make this goal a reality. This World AIDS Day, we call on President Obama to make a full-fledged commitment to placing 12 million people on treatment by 2016. This renewed effort will place us back on track to achieve an AIDS-free generation. Join us tonight on the steps of Memorial Church at 7 p.m. to commemorate the lives lost to this disease and to call for the bold action needed to ensure that one day a diagnosis will not be a death sentence for any citizen of the world.

In an unexpected foreign policy victory last week, the United States and five other world powers signed an unprecedented six-month agreement with Iran over the country’s controversial nuclear program. The new détente is a vindication of President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry’s dogged diplomacy and of the newfound moderation of Iran under President Hassan Rouhani.
In exchange for $7 billion in sanctions relief, most of which would come in the form of oil revenue frozen in foreign banks, the Iranians agreed to disable their stockpile of uranium enriched to the 20 percent level, suspend future centrifuge installation and construction of its heavy-water reactor at Arak, and allow inspections of nuclear facilities, which have already begun.
Yet the usual chorus of naysayers is raising a clamor. Israel remains the accord’s most virulent opponent, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denouncing the agreement as a “historic mistake.” Saudi Arabia’s disenchantment with the U.S., though not as overt as Israel’s, is increasingly palpable. In the U.S., neoconservative senators like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz have staked out staunch opposition to the deal for not being hard enough on Iran.
It seems that nothing short of Iran’s unconditional surrender would satiate the critics. Already, a bipartisan group of senators is drafting additional sanctions for the U.S. to levy against Iran just as the fragile six-month accord begins. The senators seem to forget that sanctions are not designed to be permanent. They worked as intended here: Iran will back away from enriching its uranium stockpiles and only use uranium enriched below the 5 percent level—sufficient for energy production but nowhere near weapons-capability. The International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London think tank that closely studies the Iranian nuclear program, believes that the deal will effectively double the “dash time” it would take Iran to develop all the materials needed for nuclear weapons.
But instead of seeing the considerable developments, Senator Cruz wrote that Iran’s nuclear program must be scaled back by “ceasing the enrichment of uranium” entirely and “exporting any remaining stockpiles of enriched uranium.” Prohibiting a country from safely pursuing a nuclear energy program simply because the U.S. disagrees with its politics is fundamentally unfair. Furthermore, it is unthinkable that Iran would assent to such a humiliation voluntarily. As the only country to actually use nuclear weapons in war, it is telling that America pretends to possess moral superiority while chiding the world about the dangers of peaceful nuclear power.
Instead, the accord marks a hopeful source for reconciliation between the United States and Iran. More vituperative actions could not have seriously curbed Iran’s nuclear weapon ambitions indefinitely. Better that the existing program be peacefully extinguished through diplomatic means instead of attempting explosive actions that would further endanger American interests.
Much has yet to be determined when the negotiations with Iran resume in six months. But enough has been done to make us hopeful that success is possible.

In a recent study conducted by the Hotamisligil Laboratory at the Harvard School of Public Health, a group of scientists discovered that a naturally occurring molecule called TUDCA, or Tauroursodeoxycholic acid, could prevent Type 1 Diabetes.
Feyza Engin, lead author of the study, said that she and her team sought to understand the role of endoplasmic reticulum, an organelle that synthesizes and modifies proteins, stress in the onset of diabetes. According to Engin, high levels of stress incapacitate endoplasmic reticulum, or ER, functioning by disrupting proper protein folding in insulin-producing beta cells, which eventually results in Type 1 Diabetes.
“The reason the study is getting a lot of attention is because [Type 1 Diabetes] is an autoimmune disease...but in this study we focused on the beta cells,” said Engin, who is also a research associate in the genetics department at the School of Public Health.
In patients with Type 1 Diabetes, beta cells are attacked by the body’s own immune system, so that the body can no longer create the necessary amount of insulin. However, Gokhan S. Hotamisligil, senior author of the study, said that the body’s autoimmune response is not enough to cause Type 1 Diabetes.
Hotamisligil, who is also the chair of the genetics department at the School of Public Health, said there must be something else that makes beta cells susceptible to the attack.
“We found that an organelle, ER, seems to exhibit signs of dysfunction in the course of diabetes,” he said.
Drawing on information from the lab’s earlier studies on Type 2 Diabetes, the researchers decided to administer a naturally occurring molecule, TUDCA, which they had found reduced ER stress in cases of Type 2 Diabetes. Researchers discovered that when TUDCA was administered to mice, it enhanced ER function and was able to prevent Type 1 Diabetes.
Although the use of a molecule like TUDCA would not be able to cure Type 1 Diabetes in those who already have it, this study has implications for those who are at risk for Type 1 Diabetes or have been recently diagnosed with the disease.
“I want to look at the big picture and tackle this question in a more detailed way using genetic and cellular biology techniques,” said Engin.
Both Engin and Hotamisligil said that TUDCA has yet to be tested on individuals, but since the chemical has already been approved for human use, it is possible that tests will begin in the near future.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Dec. 4, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the function of the endoplasmic reticulum. In fact, the organelle synthesizes and modifies proteins rather than producing antibodies.

Over a thousand people dressed as Santa Clauses, elves, and reindeer descended upon Harvard Square for the third annual Yulefest race on Sunday morning.
 
The run, one of five annual 5k races in Cambridge, kicked off at the intersection of Holyoke Street and Massachusetts Avenue and was followed by a post-race block party on Brattle Street.
 
Many of the participants in the race, which included students and residents from the Boston and Cambridge area, said that they entered the 5k largely for celebratory, rather than competitive, reasons.
 
John Jantz, a fifth-year student at Northeastern University and a former track and cross country runner, said that even though he ended his racing career, he decided to join the race after hearing that his friends had enjoyed previous Yulefest runs.
 
“I thought it would be a fun Sunday morning to get out the door and get started early,” said Jantz. “I’m purposely running really slow today because my racing career is done.... I’m just running for fun today.”
 
Two runners decked out in matching kilts said that they participated in the race after enjoying previous Cambridge 5k races and after-parties. One of them added that the festive themes always made for a good time.
 
Despite a light drizzle early on, onlookers and race volunteers cheered on the runners throughout the 5k. Once participants completed the race, they stayed around to encourage fellow runners, chat with friends, and head to the after-party, which was sponsored by four local brewers. A few runners played drums at the finish line.
 
One woman, who came to Yulefest for the second year to support her friends who were running, said that she is always impressed by the creativity of runners’ costumes. One of the most memorable costumes, she said, was a Santa without pants on who was wearing a speedo underneath his Santa coat.
 
Event organizers awarded “Best Costume” prizes to individual runners in addition to prizes for the fastest female and male runners and for the fastest teams. Benefits from the race went to Cambridge Family and Children’s Services.

For the first time since the Boston-area bike-sharing company Hubway was founded two and a half years ago, Cambridge will keep its Hubway bikes on the road this winter season.
The pilot program, announced by Hubway and the City of Cambridge in a joint press release on Nov. 19, will bring year-round Hubway service to almost all of Cambridge’s 26 Hubway stations, including the seven at Harvard.
“We are pleased at the opportunity to pilot Hubway service year-round,” Cambridge City Manager Richard C. Rossi said in the press release. “We’re committed to supporting sustainable transportation options, and we are excited to continue the program this winter season.”
According to the press release, just one Cambridge location—the station at Lafayette Square/Main Street—was scheduled to be removed from the street for the season. Another Cambridge location, at Lechmere, was scheduled to be relocated to a nearby sidewalk.
Hubway’s other stations in Boston, Brookline, and Somerville, which are not participating in the pilot program, were scheduled for seasonal closings in the past several weeks.
Cambridge is not the only city to keep its bike-sharing program open for the cold winter months. Chicago’s Divvy and Denver’s B-Cycle bike-sharing companies also announced they would run year-round this year. Bike-sharing systems in New York and Toronto already run through the winter and were looked to as examples as Hubway planned its Cambridge pilot program, according to the Boston Globe.
For some Harvard students, the prospect of Hubway operating a bike-sharing system at a time in which the roads are icy and snow-filled has raised both safety and utility concerns.
“I feel like biking in the winter is dangerous and cold and inconvenient,” said Tian L. Kisch ’15, an avid biker who uses her bike to travel back and forth from the Quad. “I think [students] would be more likely to use the shuttle over using a bike, especially starting in December.”
Hubway has already taken precautions to ensure safety. According to the press release, Hubway’s dispatch office will coordinate a team to keep stations clear of snow and ice from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day.
For her part, Cabot House Eco Rep Caroline R. Breinin ’15 said she believes that Hubway’s winter operations will not pose dangers “as long as people are safe and do not use Hubway when the roads are icy.”
Breinin also applauded Hubway for allowing patrons to utilize the sustainable transportation option throughout the winter.
“I think it’s great that Hubway is extending its service for Cambridge into the winter so that patrons still have the option to use the bicycles for their commute rather than less environmentally friendly alternatives,” Breinin said.

Though many students were at home last week for the first few days of Hanukkah, they will be able to find food and festivities—from fried latkes and jelly doughnuts to traditional Jewish games of dreidel and the lighting of menorahs—across campus in the final days of the Jewish holiday.
Both Harvard Hillel and the Chabad House at Harvard will host menorah lighting ceremonies and other celebrations this week, and Hillel will sponsor student-initiated parties throughout campus as well.
“Because it has been an unusual year with Thanksgiving break falling so early, and Hanukkah turning more into Thanksgivukkah, what we did differently this year was we gave students the opportunity to plan their own Thanksgivukkah candle lighting and latke celebrations in their residential halls,” David F. Sackstein ’14, president of Hillel, said.
 
Sackstein said that students will be able to light menorahs and feast on traditional foods at Hillel throughout the week.
“We try to have more of a holiday feel around Hillel for this special time of the year,” he said.
In addition, Hillel will host a reception and menorah lighting with University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 on Tuesday night. The reception will be open to all undergraduate students.
According to an email sent by the Chabad House, Harvard Chabad will also host multiple Grand Menorah lighting ceremonies on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday evenings with Garber, University President Drew G. Faust, and Cambridge Mayor Henrietta J. Davis, respectively. The ceremonies led by Garber and Faust will take place on the steps of Widener Library, while the event hosted by Davis will take place in Cambridge Common.
On Tuesday night, the Chabad House will entertain guests at Tommy Doyle’s, an Irish pub and restaurant, for a Hanukkah celebration. According to the email, guests will be able to enjoy latkes, appetizers, dancing, and gelt—chocolate coins traditionally eaten during Hanukkah.
Students said that they appreciate the efforts of Hillel and the Chabad House to celebrate the holiday on campus. 
Leore C. Lavin ’17 and Edyt J. Dickstein ’17, frequenters of Harvard Hillel, said they will host a Hanukkah party in the basement of Thayer Hall on Monday night, with catered Jewish food and dreidel lessons for beginners.
“It’s really nice that Hillel is helping spreading holiday cheer throughout freshman dorms and upperclassman houses with these casual parties,” Lavin said. “Hanukkah is a really exciting holiday, and it is all inclusive, and it is always nice for all races and religions to learn more about the holiday and other Jewish traditions.”
Talia Weisberg ’17 said that she thinks the Hillel-sponsored events make it easier for students to get involved and celebrate the holiday, adding that she plans to light her menorah at Hillel.
“I’ll be at Hillel mostly, so I don’t light my dorm on fire, which actually happened to someone a couple years ago,” she said jokingly.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Dec. 2, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly attributed a quotation about attending a menorah lighting at Harvard Hillel to Talia K. Rothstein ’17. In fact, it was Talia Weisberg '17 who jokingly spoke about celebrating the holiday at Hillel so as to avoid starting a dorm-room fire.

It’s hard to score without the ball. This is a problem that the Harvard women’s basketball team (6-2) has encountered one too many times this year.
The Crimson, plagued by turnovers all season, saw the consequences of sloppy play Sunday afternoon, as it fell to Big East power St. John’s (5-1) at Carnesecca Arena. Down only three with just 43 ticks left on the clock, the Crimson turned the ball over for the 24th time on the night, as the Red Storm drew the charge.
After a precession of fouls and free throws, Harvard was staring up at the scoreboard with an 81-76 score to think over on the bus ride home. The Crimson is averaging 18.9 turnovers per a game, a true Achilles heel for the team thus far.
“[St. John’s] came out in the second half…. and had a pretty good run,” junior guard Ali Curtis said. “They picked up the defensive pressure, forcing a lot of turnovers that could have been avoided.”
Harvard led by as many as nine in the first half and headed into the locker room with a 36-30 advantage at the break. But the Red Storm never went away, breaking out into an 11-2 run to gain the lead in the second, as they picked up the intensity.
The Red Storm managed to score 34 points off of Crimson turnovers, as sophomore Aliyyah Handford led the comeback for her home squad. Harvard could not compete with the backcourt of St. John’s as Handford and freshman Aaliyah Lewis combined for 44 of the team’s 81 points on the day.
“Other than our turnovers, which was a matter of little scrappy guards stripping ours and pushing layups, I thought we could have turned the game around” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “We should have done a better job protecting our point guards from that.”
Despite the Crimson’s inability to possess the ball, it found success developing an interior presence. Junior forward Temi Fagbenle had another standout night, as she posted a season-high 20 points, her third such game in her career. Fagbenle, who was just shy of a double-double with eight rebounds, was the answer for Harvard, stopping crucial runs in the second half with clutch baskets.
“Every time [Temi] steps on the court, she is definitely one of our go-to players,” Curtis said. “We wanted to get her involved because we were dominating in the post and she was doing a good job down there so we were looking for her.”
Led by Fagbenle, the Crimson dominated the paint, outrebounding St. John’s 48-25, including 23 second-chance points. Nonetheless, Fagbenle was the victim of a poor call, according to Delaney-Smith, which led to two quick fouls and a spot on the bench for the veteran early in the first half.
The Crimson brought a balanced attack to Queens, as the team saw four players score in double figures, including nine rebounds and four points from senior combo guard Melissa Mullins.
“[Having a balanced attack is] one of our strongest attributes,” Curtis said. “We have a very deep bench and people who can come off the bench and come into the game and score. That’s a great testament to our teamwork and our practice day in and day out, and everyone come in and make an impact.”
As Harvard heads to the Arizona State Classic this weekend, it may have to look to many of these bench players for scoring, as co-captain Christine Clark battled an injury in the second half. Though Clark finished the game in double digits for the seventh time this season, her health will be a key determinant of the Crimson’s success moving forward.
“I’m hoping Clark recovers from her injury in the second half,” Delaney-Smith said. ”The tournament at ASU is a good tournament.”
With Clark sidelined, the Red Storm took advantage, making a late run to take the lead, and never looked back. Without its leading scorer, the Crimson stuck to its offensive game plan of forcing the ball inside, but was eventually undone by St. John’s late push.

The Harvard women’s hockey team stayed in Cambridge to practice last week, so the team’s Bostonians hosted teammates for Thanksgiving Thursday. The feast continued Sunday when the Crimson took the ice against Dartmouth. Five different skaters scored goals as Harvard breezed by Dartmouth, 5-0.
The Crimson (8-1-1, 7-1-1) scored two goals on the power play while killing all six Big Green (2-9-0, 2-7-0) power plays to extend its unbeaten streak to seven games.
“During the long week of practice we could focus and tone the little things,” junior captain Marissa Gedman said. “Then Sunday we capitalized on that extra practice.”
Gedman scored her second goal of the year to give Harvard a 4-0 lead midway through the third period, cementing a Crimson win even though Dartmouth outshout its host, 25-19. The Big Green tallied 10 of those shots in the final period, but sophomore Emerance Maschmeyer blocked every one to tally her fourth shutout of the year.
“It was nice that Maschmeyer got another shutout and Gedman, our captain, got a goal,” sophomore Miye D’Oench said. “Both are big leaders on the team and they are proving what they are worth lately.”
While the team’s leaders sealed the win, it was D’Oench who put Dartmouth away late in the second period. Up 2-0 at the time, senior Gina McDonald won a battle along the boards and got the puck up to D’Oench in the offensive zone. From there, D’Oench carved into the offensive zone and found just enough room above the goaltender’s glove to put her team up, 3-0.
“Going from a two-goal lead to a three-goal lead is huge because you kind of break out at that point,” D’Oench said.”
But D’Oench added that the game felt closer than the score indicated, and Dartmouth competed throughout. Gedman felt similarly.
“It’s a huge rivalry so it’s going to be fueled on and off the ice,” Gedman said. “We were expecting that, it’s always fun to have a little bit of rivalry.”
Dartmouth came out and controlled play early, tallying eight shots in the first 10 minutes. Meanwhile, Harvard—playing its first game in over a week—did not come out as strongly in it wanted, Gedman said.
The Big Green also drew two penalties but could not convert on either. Harvard has now allowed just one goal in 48 penalty kills.
When Dartmouth was called for hooking minutes later, the Crimson capitalized. Sophomore Dylanne Crugnale found the back of the net off an assist from Gedman to put Harvard up, 1-0.
“You always want to get the first goal and that was a big one,” D’Oench said.
With the win, Harvard also moved to 2-0-1 in Ivy games and 7-1-1 in ECAC play. Coming into the year, the Crimson was picked to finish third in the ECAC without garnering a first place vote. It now leads the conference with 15 points, one more than Cornell.
“You can definitely feel the energy, the energy is so positive in locker room with coaches and then with the buzz, it’s easy to see things are going well for us,” Gedman said. “Sometimes hard work does not pay off but right now it is for us.”
Harvard has gotten off to its hot start despite facing several Olympics-related departures before the season and multiple injuries in the first couple weeks.
“We were facing a lot of adversity off the bat,” Gedman said. “We don’t pay a lot of attention to our record but weekend after weekend to come up successful is so good for morale. Going into break like we are is something we are so proud of.”
Injuries to an already shallow roster have forced many players to switch lines in the early weeks.
Freshman Sydney Daniels came in as a forward but has increasingly played defense. Sunday, she scored one of the team’s goals, her fourth this year.
Daniels’ success in the face of adversity has represented the team’s success in the face of adversity generally as things have fallen into place for the Crimson.
“Freshman have basically stepped up and especially now everyone is comfortable on the ice and with their role on the team,” said D’Oench, who has played with three different lines herself. “I think that’s huge moving forward.”

In a recent interview with Anderson Cooper, Malcolm Gladwell discussed his new book, "David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants." Gladwell took the time to comment on the kinds of damage an Ivy League education can do to one's self esteem.
"If you go to an elite school where the other students in your class are all really brilliant," Gladwell told Cooper (who is himself a Yale alum), "you run the risk of mistakenly believing yourself to not be a good student.... If you're last in your class at Harvard, it doesn't feel like you're a good student, even though you really are."
Any student here would agree that there are times at Harvard when that can ring true. Flyby's here to make sure you don't always have to feel like that. Here's our list of ways to boost your self-esteem if you're feeling like a guppy.

 
Treat Yourself
Tom Haverford said it best. Getting yourself a little treat can brighten your mood and give you something to look forward to, whether it's a piping hot chocolate or an amazing new pair of shoes. And that's not the only way to treat yourself. Let yourself watch half an hour of TV. Blast your favorite guilty pleasure song ("Wrecking Ball," anyone?) and dance around your room. Get one of those ten-minute massages at the Wellness Center. Go play soccer (even in the freezing cold). It'll make you feel better about life. We guarantee it.
 
Memory Lane
Old birthday cards, yearbook signatures, your friends' Facebook albums from middle school—all these things are likely to put a smile on your face. It's hilarious to read the ridiculous things you and your friends said and thought back in the day. Plus, there's nothing better than remembering that you no longer look like you did in middle school. No matter how smart and accomplished we Harvard students may be, that was a rough time for all of us.
 
Get off Facebook
People say this a lot and then ignore it, but it's a fact: social media makes you sadder. Seeing other people's pictures and friends and status updates inevitably makes you see your own in a worse light. News flash: all those other people see your pictures and friends and status updates and think the same thing. The grass is always green, so get off Facebook.
 
Talk it Out
Find your proctor, PAF, tutor, or close friend. Call your parents, chat with your favorite dining hall worker, or go talk to a peer counselor. It feels good to vent.
 
Take a Nap
Self-explanatory. Everything is better after a nap.
 
Remember How You Got Here
Yeah, you're at Harvard. The important thing to remember is that you were chosen to be here; something about you was special enough to make you stand out from the rest. Don't forget that something (even when you get your CS50 midterm back next week).

Langdell Library houses more than just stressed out 1Ls.
Just north of Harvard Yard, the immense stone building holds many valuable items, including over 70,000 legal images and over 300,000 rare books and early-illuminated manuscripts. Karen S. Beck, the curator of the Historical and Special Collections and Rare Books, leads a team of six librarians in managing these artifacts, books and paintings. Beck took The Crimson behind the scenes to glimpse these cool—and sometimes wacky—materials.
Supreme Sword
While the Supreme Court often faces the obstacle of issuing decisions without an army to enforce them, the Justices themselves are no strangers to waging war. Associate Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. '61, a former professor at Harvard Law School, fought in the Civil War. In addition to storing the flag he was supposed to have used, Langdell Hall also hosts the sword he brandished. So next time the student in the carrel next to you is drumming his pencil, you don't just have to resort to dirty looks thrown in between the book shelves—the special collections are here to help.
 The Highest Lunchbox in the Land
Although the Harvard Law School library has a tremendous collection of scholarly legal materials, its halls are not above housing the most modest of items: a lunch box. The small tin box was used by Holmes each day as he sat on the highest bench in America, helping to feed one of the greatest legal minds of American history.
Thurgood Marshall Bobbleheads
Ever think that the Supreme Court Justices don't even know themselves what they think? Are they confused between yes or no? Is it possible to simultaneously shake and nod your head? Well, you have more evidence than you think if you peruse the collection at Langdell, where you will find a "pretty good collection of Supreme Court Bobblehead dolls" that will go on exhibit later this year, according to Beck.
 Magna-ficent Carta
Before the days of the internet or even the printing press, citizens of England were notified of their legal rights four times a year when a representative would read aloud the Magna Carta in the town square. Harvard Law School library showcases a Magna Carta from 1327 that was thusly used. And it’s just one of 23 manuscript Magna Cartas in the Law School's collection. For Beck, it's difficult to choose one that stands out among the rest: "It's like trying to pick a favorite child."
"Royal" Portrait
In addition to the manuscripts, books, swords and lunch boxes strewn throughout the library, Langdell also houses a collection of paintings, including one of Isaac Royal and his family. Royal gave a big fat donation to the Law School, but the real reason why we keep his painting around is because it’s the first example of group portraiture in colonial America. Good thing it’s a "first" because competition for space is tough—according to Beck, there isn’t enough room for any more portraits.
The Casebook That Began At All
For every Law student staying up late reading for criminal procedure and every undergrad cramming for their Con Law paper, the search for blame is over. Point your fingers at the casebook of Christopher Columbus Langdell, who created the case method of pedagogy in law schools. He ruined your weekend plans back in 1871.

It's obnoxiously cold outside, which means winter--the season for hot chocolate--is nearly here! Flyby decided to selflessly brave the elements to offer you a list of the Square’s best warm chocolatey beverage offerings. Following our extensive research, we present you with some of our favorites:LA BurdickIf you haven't been to LA Burdick, you’re definitely missing out. There's no question that Burdick tops the list for best hot chocolate in the square. Their thick, rich beverage tastes like melted chocolate heaven, and you get to pick between either milk or dark chocolate. It's very filling, so make sure to save room if you're planning on heading there after a meal!Crema CaféAlthough nothing can beat LA Burdick’s delectable treats, Crema Café makes for a close second. This hot chocolate is slightly more bitter than Burdick's, which might be preferable for some. Pro tip: Ask for whipped cream and cinnamon to make your drink extra special.Café PamplonaCafé Pamplona is a hidden gem. If you haven't been, you should definitely check out this delightful little place. The hot chocolate here tastes pretty standard, but the Euro feel makes the experience that much more special.Peet’s CaféThe presentation of Peet's hot chocolate is pretty impressive and the flavor is very creamy with the perfect amount of chocolate flavor. A solid choice!StarbucksSure, Starbucks isn’t a sophisticated café that devotes itself to making the perfect hot chocolate, but they have plenty of variety in their flavors and Starbucks is ubiquitous enough that a steaming hot beverage is always within easy reach. We particularly reccomend the peppermint hot chocolate for a winter delight!

Following an unprecedented series of events culminating with joke ticket candidatesSamuel B. Clark ’15 and Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 winning and immediately announcing plans for resignation from the positions of Undergraduate Council president and vice president, Flyby returns with another interview with these two rising politicians.
Flyby: The question that must be asked: did you ever expect you would actually win this election?Clark: At the beginning of the campaign we did not. At the beginning of the campaign it was a big old joke.Mayopoulos: We could not imagine how anyone would vote for us.Clark: Because our platform was soup, toilet paper, and divest from gender neutral weekend shuttles, which means nothing.
Flyby: When did your chances begin to change?Mayopoulos: I would say it really started when people started coming up to us and saying, “Everyone I know has voted for you.”Clark: The first day of the official campaign we did nothing because we didn’t really fully have our shit together. [The] second day we decided that instead of having a gradual trickle of our campaign starting, we would just start everything on the second day. So we assembled a small army of posterers—people to put up posters—and so, Wednesday at midnight, we hit all the houses, and Thursday at 8 a.m. we hit all the Yard. Perhaps to the detriment of our classes, we spent a stupid amount of time on our Facebook, and our Facebook quickly escalated to hundreds of more likes than we anticipated, and became the driving force behind the jokes we were putting out. It was when people would talk about our posters very casually, or people would tell us that they heard conversations about them in the d-halls, or that our Facebook likes kept racking up, that we thought, “Oh, this could maybe happen!”Mayopoulos: Part of this was also a shift in our competitors. You know, this stuff, being like, “Aha, those guys, those jokesters,” and then [members of their campaign staff] started sending out emails being like, "Jokes are all good and fun, but don't forget to vote for solutions!"Clark: That's the point where they considered us to be a threat and [we thought] maybe we should consider ourselves to be a threat. For the debate, we decided to maybe take a slight tonal shift.... I think both of our competitors and most people watching the debate were taken aback and surprised that half of our answers were actually rather serious and rather pointed.
Mayopoulos: I took a bite out of an onion, which no one saw...literally, if you watch the full [debate] video there’s a three second clip.Clark: Gus was literally sobbing next to me, writing notes: "Sam, oh God, it burns!"Mayopoulos: ’Cause I just took a bite out of a raw onion!
[Laughter]
Flyby: What were your thoughts right before the results came out?Mayopoulos: The night of the results, it was still very much up in the air.Clark: Absolutely. We were really not sure.Mayopoulos: I think it says that, while there's a large portion of the student body who took the campaigns very seriously, there's another large chunk that was, you know, perhaps very unsatisfied with the situation and voted for a joke ticket to voice that.Clark: Yeah, and we actually, we've gotten the question before about...our voting demographic? And at least initially, it was people who were like, "Ha, this is funny, let's vote for this because it's a joke." Which was most of our friends and people who don't normally vote in UC elections. But then it did evolve into people who were also voting because they saw a lack of delivery on certain campaign promises in the past.Mayopoulos: A lack of connection. Yeah, I think people saw us and got into heated arguments on Facebook about like, these are people who actually understand what students want, and are willing to talk about it in a real way.Clark: Yeah. And talking about it in a way using things like tomato basil soup and toilet paper as sort of silly proclamations but then also...Mayopoulos: It was huge that HUDS changed that policy. It's not entirely clear if we played any role in that, but um...
[Laughter]
Flyby: At what point did you guys settle on resignation?Clark: We...Gus and I discussed this...Mayopoulos: Extensively.Clark: Ad nauseum. Which in Latin means to the point of vomiting.
[Laughter]
Clark: We actually, like, discussed this really extensively. Because this was a joke candidacy from the beginning, you know, at the start of this [we] had no intention of ever running the UC. We had no intention of having that sort of job, that sort of responsibility.Mayopoulos: It's one thing to run a joke campaign.Clark: Exactly.... I think our campaign demonstrated that we are very good at mobilizing and organizing people, so we...there is a possibility that we could be a good president and vice president. But the fact of the matter is that, quite simply, it's not something that we intended to do from the beginning.Mayopoulos: And there's no guarantee that we can do it well. I think, we hope, that the message that we sent out with this, that people are...Clark: They feel disconnected.Mayopoulos: They feel disconnected. And with both the UC and the administration, these are things we hope that the next round of UC president and vice president take into account.... It was a joke, but it wasn't all lost.Clark: The more serious message that we took on during the debate, we don't think would be furthered by us actually running the UC. But it would be furthered by us stepping down and giving the reins to people who know how to operate within [it].
