On May 26, the inaugural Boston Calling music festival closed its doors on an enormously successful weekend. Despite the dreary weather, some 20,000 concertgoers showed up to take in top indie acts like The National, the Shins, and fun. However, co-creator Brian Appel viewed the festival as more of a learning experience. “We saw a lot of things behind the scenes that we want to tweak and make better,” Appel admits. He’ll get a chance this fall, when Boston Calling returns to City Hall Plaza on Saturday and Sunday, this time with a bolder, more diverse lineup that features Vampire Weekend and Kendrick Lamar.
 
In May, Appel put together Boston’s first major music festival with help from co-founder Mike Snow and The National guitarist Aaron Dessner. The result was an indie-heavy lineup that skewed to the intellectual, with acts like Dirty Projectors and Andrew Bird. There will be quite a different scene this time around, with more traditional rock outfits being replaced by DJs and rappers.
“We know that the audience that lives in Boston in September is a little different, just given the amount of students that come back,” Appel says. “We wanted to go out on a ledge a little bit more in terms of bringing in dance and hip-hop, and we hope the audience responds.”
Audiences will likely respond well to Lamar, arguably the rapper of the year, and Major Lazer, producer Diplo’s hyperactive, genre-hopping dance project. It will also be hard to ignore Solange, who may not have her sister Beyoncé’s status, but makes up for it with her innovation, style and mystique.
 
Appel and the team of producers made a point not only of improving the diversity of the festival, but also of showcasing local talent. “We have the gumption to call ourselves Boston Calling, so we would be very short-sighted to not look in our own backyard,” Appel says. The festival simultaneously serves as a breaking-out party for Boston-based Bearstronaut—whose huge melodies and danceable guitar lines are reminiscent of the Cure—and a homecoming bash for Cambridge’s own Passion Pit, whose latest album “Gossamer” hit #4 on the Billboard 200 and was acclaimed by critics across the country.
 
Of course, every festival needs an anchor, and Vampire Weekend fit the bill splendidly. There are very few bands who have exhibited the range, talent, and growth of Vampire Weekend over the last decade; their latest album, “Modern Vampires of the City,” is a triumph of adventurous songwriting, impeccable production and sly lyricism. Furthermore, they have ties to the festival: “We got to know them when they were Orpheum Theatre-size,” recalls Appel, referring to the smaller Boston venue. “They would come through and do smaller shows, and to watch them grow has been terrific.”
 
Like Vampire Weekend, Boston Calling seems determined to expand its scope and improve with every iteration. Whether or not this weekend's weather will be an improvement on May's, Boston Calling has something new to offer for everyone.
Also playing: Local Natives, The Gaslight Anthem, The Airborne Toxic Event, Wolfgang Gartner, Bat for Lashes, Flosstradamus, Deer Tick, Okkervil River, Flume, Big Black Delta, You Won’t, Lucius, Viva Viva, Royal Teeth

President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s famous fireside chats did not take place next to the cozy hearth their name suggests—but they might as well have. Roosevelt spoke over the radio, after all, so no one could see him.
Roosevelt’s shrewd decision to ride the radio wave of technological progress into the hearts of millions of Americans set precedent for countless presidents to come. Over the years, the Oval Office has doubled as a radio broadcast room, a television studio, and now something like a teenager’s couch: Twitter has scratched, clawed, tweeted, and retweeted its way up from popular culture into politics.
The evolution of many politicos into veritable twitterati—President Barack Obama, for example, holds the record for most retweeted post—has presented both perks and problems. On the plus side, elected officials on Twitter can communicate directly and efficiently with more constituents than ever before. But that communication comes in the form of 140-character blasts designed to catch the eye rather than stimulate the mind. As a result, tweets can often manipulate more than they inform.
Roosevelt, too, played the public in his fireside chats. For one thing, the addresses’ homely charm was manufactured—listeners imagined the president sitting next to the same crackling logs and flames that graced their own living rooms when, in reality, he reclined behind his far from unassuming desk in the Oval Office. For another, speaking over the air allowed Roosevelt to communicate with citizens without worrying about revealing his wheelchair. The chair, Roosevelt thought, made him look weak to a nation itself crippled by financial ruin.
All the same, the fireside chats ultimately achieved a worthy goal: Roosevelt helped restore confidence to a frightened, struggling country. He forged a personal connection with his constituents and made his message—a substantive, significant one—heard. As the years went on, however, radio became old news. The rise of television brought with it cause for a deeper concern: that the public might find itself swayed not by the points of a politician’s platform but by the cut of his hair and caliber of his smile.
The nation’s first televised debate brought together Democratic nominee John F. Kennedy and Republican candidate Richard Nixon in a contest that some say determined the election’s outcome. Kennedy, young, fresh-faced, and fit, won over most of the approximately 74 million viewers who watched the battle on television. Nixon, who faced the cameras with sunken cheeks and a sweaty brow, fared much worse among that crowd. Listeners on the radio, however, thought different: Based on the content of the contenders’ answers—appearances aside—Americans believed that Nixon had stolen the day.
Twitter should set off the same warning bells today that rang loud in 1960. Tweeters likely do not judge politicians based on the quality of their avatars (though Hillary Clinton’s clever nod to the Texts From Hillary meme that swept the Internet certainly cannot hurt). But still, superficiality often wins out over substance in the Twittersphere. For example, a recent tweet about Bo Obama, First Dog of the United States, trying to “make fetch happen” got considerably more play than another with a link to President Obama’s statement on the current situation in Syria. Cute, neatly packaged tweets that transform presidential pooches into furrier versions of Gretchen Weiners go over better with the public than do serious missives about the issues of the day.
Couple that with Twitter’s 140-character limit, and tweets necessarily become reductive. The politicians who find the most success on Twitter do so by condensing their messages into easily digestible mini press releases that, while often times entertaining, provide readers with only the bare bones of their representatives’ reasoning. In order to get to the meat of the decisions made daily in the White House and on the Hill, readers must delve deeper. A clever tweet has its merits but should never on its own convince a constituent of the virtue of a politician or the value of his plans.
New technologies like Twitter introduce new possibilities for politics, at best resulting in a better-informed populace due to easier communication between officials and their constituents. But they also present new dangers. The allures of a shiny new platform like Twitter may distract citizens from the sometimes-duller issues of real import. By all means, we should follow politicians on Twitter—let’s just take care not to do it blindly.

To unknowing first-years seeking to become involved with the Hispanic community at Harvard, the number of separate organizations can seem daunting: Concilio Latino, Fuerza, Hola, Raza, Latinas Unidas, and the Latino Men’s Collective. Although these are all organizations that foster community and social experience among students with similar backgrounds, they nevertheless also divide the Hispanic community. The different meeting times, places, and variation from year to year are enough to ensure insufficient interaction among a set of students that share many interests. By removing one of the factors contributing to this problem and creating a central place for all Latino and Latin American culture to thrive, this problem would easily be overcome, and a stronger community would result. This central place should be modeled after the Latino cultural centers found at Yale and Stanford, both founded in 1977.
Despite efforts stretching back decades, little progress has been made in establishing a center at Harvard. In 2001, a memo was sent to University President Larry Summers from Marcelo Suarez-Orozco and 11 other faculty members proposing that the University create a permanent Latino Studies Center. Following the proposal, Summers indicated disapproval of the project, and later shot down the initiative by withholding the money requested from the presidential funds to complete the project. The University has taken the same stance on the issue for decades, holding to the idea that a Cultural center would promote ethnic separation.
However, that is simply not the case. By examining our peer institutions, we can tell that cultural centers promote inclusion rather than exclusion. Sandy Placido, a Harvard Ph.D. American Studies student and Greenough Proctor remembers her undergraduate years at Yale, and recognizes the significant impact of La Casa Cultural, Yale’s Latino center, at the college. “I believe a Latina/o cultural center would greatly benefit the students on Harvard's campus,” she explains. “A cultural center would create a physical space where students could meet each other and work together, but it would also create an emotional space where students could develop and articulate their identities in a safe and supportive space.”
In response to the argument that a cultural space would promote separation of the student body, Placido says, “A Latina/o cultural center would not lead to permanent self-segregation. In fact, it would allow students to develop and strengthen their leadership in a space that acknowledges all aspects of their identity, allowing them to go on and take charge in other spaces on campus.” The administration’s disinterest in the development and fostering of cultural connections at the college also translates to a more general administrative detachment from Latino and Latin American studies. Many students and faculty feel like Harvard has yet to show a strong commitment to increase course offering that address Latino/a and Latin American issues. According to Placido, this means “hiring more faculty, especially faculty of color, who can serve as mentors, regardless of what they teach.”
Although the goal of improving the course offerings within Latino studies—possibly even establishing a concentration—may seem far off, it is not out of reach. There are also already many courses that could be integrated into this potential program of study. There are concentrations and secondary fields on campus, such as History and Literature and Ethnic Studies, which should be strengthened to address topics in Latina/o and Latin American studies. “If course offerings are built up to a sufficient level, it would be wonderful to have a Latina/o, Latin American and Caribbean Studies concentration, since the historical and contemporary issues in these regions and their diasporas intimately affect our everyday lives as Harvard students and as residents of the United States,” says Placido.
As clear proof that the University is moving in the right direction stands the newly created Instituto Cervantes Observatory of the Spanish Language and Hispanic Cultures. A center dedicated to the study of the Spanish language and its progress in the United States. While this collaborative project may indeed place Harvard and Spain’s Instituto Cervantes at the “forefront of Spanish language scholarship,” as University President Drew G. Faust has projected, the University still ignores pushes for both a college student cultural center and a Latina/o and Latin American studies degree.  Nevertheless, as the newly installed observatory also plans to host Hispanic culture initiatives throughout the year, its installment is a definite step forward for the oldest university in a country which, by 2050, will have the largest Spanish-speaking population in the world.
The campaign for a Latin American studies degree program is not a new one. Campaigns addressing the lack of such a concentration began in the early 1970s and have continued to today. Still, very little progress has been made in terms of the main objectives of this movement. Its biggest success was the establishment of the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies in 1994. Today, this organization works to provide research and travel grants for University affiliates and offers a certificate program in Latin American Studies for undergraduates. Nevertheless, a Latino/a and Latin American studies degree program is still further than it should be from realization, even while, a little further down the river, techy MIT offers majors in Latin American and Latino Studies.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hungry undergraduates seeking to satisfy their sweet tooth at Insomnia Cookies on Mt. Auburn Street during the wee hours of Sunday, August 18 must have encountered a very different scene from the one they anticipated. At midnight that night, four night-shift workers at that well-trafficked cookie franchise decided to go on strike and shut down operations at the store for three hours in what one protester referred to as an “occupation.”
The striking workers, all fired the next day, allege that they have been denied legally mandated one-hour breaks during their eight-hour shifts and that management has failed to ensure that drivers, who deliver cookies, earned the minimum wage. These are serious charges, and, if substantiated, demand remedial action. We have no sympathy for businesses that flout labor regulations, and if these charges prove accurate, the management ought to face the penalties dictated by law.
There are established procedures by which to seek redress for grievances. The workers have said they plan to file a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, which adjudicates such disputes, but this comes after a controversial foray into direct action. Workers should have stuck with the NLRB tack or sought legal redress, rather than shut down operations at their store. The management could hardly be expected to continue employing workers who shut down business for any length of time.
In addition to citing possible violations of Massachusetts labor laws, the strikers and their supporters at the Industrial Workers of the World have cited low wages as a cause for their continued protest, with one participant saying that the wages did not represent “a livable wage for the area.” Cashiers and bakers at Insomnia Cookies are paid $9 an hour and drivers receive $5 an hour plus commission and tips—wages that the Insomnia Cookies website describes as “above average.” The MIT Living Wage Project calculates that someone living in Cambridge requires $12.62 an hour to meet the basic cost of living, although the Massachusetts minimum wage stands at $8.00.
While we are sympathetic to the workers’ desire for higher wages, we think the matter is best handled by the state legislature, which could increase the state minimum wage, than by business owners, who will inevitably be at a competitive disadvantage if they pay their workers above-market wages.

Just over two weeks ago, four Insomnia Cookies employees, citing allegations that the management violated labor regulations, staged what one striker described as an occupation of the store. These employees have since been fired, but their protest continues—now joined by the Industrial Workers of the World—against the practices of the Insomnia Cookies management. In addition to complaints that Insomnia Cookies did not provide the legally mandated one-hour break for shifts longer than eight hours and that it failed to pay delivery drivers the minimum wage, the former workers rallied for higher wages, health care benefits, and the ability to unionize. The Insomnia Cookies protest attests to the poor working conditions in the fast-food industry and highlights the need for a more realistic minimum wage commensurate with the living wage.
Across the country, fast-food workers from New England as well as from the South and West have recently joined in protest against the low wages endemic in the fast-food industry. Noting that the median wage of a full-time fast-food worker falls 30 percent short of the official poverty budget and opting instead for the term “starvation wage,” experts contend that the minimum wage has failed to keep pace with productivity and inflation. As a result, low-wage workers have actually suffered a decrease in quality of life.
These findings are corroborated by the MIT Living Wage Project, which puts the “living wage”—the minimum wage an individual needs to support herself—at $12.62 and $12.29 in Cambridge and Middlesex County respectively for a one-adult household. This means that working full-time (40 hours per week) at $9 an hour, the Insomnia Cookies cashiers and bakers would not even be able to sustain even the most austere lifestyles, let alone be given any opportunity to escape poverty. It’s hardly an exaggeration to call it a “starvation wage” when it forces workers to choose between necessities to somehow make ends meet.
This debate comes at a time when low-paying industries are experiencing some of the most rapid economic growth. Although these industries make up 39 percent of American jobs, they took a lion’s share 61 percent of national job growth in July. That low-paying jobs are fueling the majority of job growth means an increasingly polarized market for wages and a rapidly eroding middle class. With many of the economy’s new jobs offering little more than a “starvation wage,” it is time to rethink the minimum wage and take action to make it commensurate with the living wage advocated by the MIT Living Wage Project.
Overwhelmingly—by a ratio of four to one—the American public supports doing just this. In a July poll by Hart Research Associates, 80 percent of respondents answered that the federal minimum wage should be increased to $10.10 an hour—a 39 percent increase—and a majority support making the federal minimum wage an “important priority” for Congress over the course of the next year. This consensus crosses typical party lines and boasts majority support among both Republicans (62 percent) and those earning over $100,000 per year (79 percent). While Congress lags far behind taking any action toward increasing the minimum wage, and while minimum wage workers struggle to survive on real wages lower than 1968 minimum, the American public is firm in its support for a sustainable minimum wage.
Many experts, too, join in support with the American public. From a 2011 paper linking an increase in the minimum wage to an increase in domestic consumer spending, to a 2010 study finding no negative employment effects associated with an increase in the minimum wage, to further claims that increasing the minimum wage could cause a slight increase in the wages of those earning just above the minimum, new economic research is contending with the long-held notion that the minimum wage acts principally as a distortionary force against employment. And in a recent poll of economic experts, a plurality agreed that increasing the minimum wage to $9 per hour and indexing it to inflation “would be a desirable policy” for minimum-wage workers.
Whether Insomnia Cookies’ labor practices followed regulations, the ensuing protests have rightfully drawn attention to the minimum wage. It is increasingly apparent that the “minimum wage” and the “minimum for survival” wage are not one in the same. The former is the minimum under state or federal law that an employer may pay to his or her employees; the latter is what a worker needs to purchase basic necessities—clothing, rent, food—in order to live. A living wage is not a lofty goal of equality, or even of near-equality, but instead a basic expectation that we guarantee each worker the same right to live on his or her income.

Part I of a four-part series on Harvard’s incoming Class of 2017, based on data collected by The Crimson in an online survey conducted in the month of August. Part II ran on Wednesday, Part III ran on Thursday, and Part IV of the series will run on Friday. 
Men in Harvard’s incoming Class of 2017 expect to earn far more money after graduation than their female classmates expect to earn, according to a Crimson survey of the freshman class that arrived on campus last week.
While 48 percent of males expect to earn more than $70,000 in their first year after college, only 28 percent of females predicted they will earn more than $70,000.
The gap was also pronounced within lower and high expected income brackets. Thirteen percent of female respondents and 6 percent of male respondents said that they expect their first post-graduation job to earn them less than $30,000 per year. Nine percent of male respondents said they expected to earn more than $110,000, but only 3 percent of females indicated such high anticipated earnings.
The Crimson conducted an email survey of the freshman class from Aug. 5 to Aug. 28, and 1,311 incoming students responded—nearly 80 percent of the Class of 2017—although not all of them completed the survey. Questions covered demographics, college admissions, and attitudes and experiences related to studying, cheating, extracurricular activities, sex, drugs, mental health, politics, religion, and technology. We assume that a random sample of students responded to the survey and consequently ignore any selection bias.
WHO THEY ARE
Every year, the College touts the racial and geographic diversity of its admitted class. And largely, the results of The Crimson’s freshman survey align with the demographic data reported by the College.
Respondents were evenly split by gender. Sixty-two percent reported that they were white, 25 percent said they were Asian, and Latino and African-American students accounted for 11 and 10 percent of the class, respectively, with some students identifying as multiple ethnicities.
Most freshmen said that they were either the oldest or youngest child in their family, while 16 percent said that they were middle children. Sixteen percent said they did not have siblings.
Ninety percent of freshmen said that they identify as heterosexual, 4 percent said they identify as homosexual, 2 percent said they were bisexual, and 3 percent said they were “questioning.”
Of those respondents who identified as homosexual or bisexual, most said that they had come out sometime during high school, while about 18 percent reported doing so during middle school and 22 percent this past summer.
Recruited athletes make up 12 percent of the class, according to the survey, while another 9 percent of non-recruited freshmen said that they planned to walk on to a varsity team. Men were somewhat more likely to say they were a recruited athlete than women.
Recruited athletes were far more likely to say they identified as heterosexual than as another orientation. Only three recruited athletes said they were homosexual, bisexual, questioning, or other.
Recruited athletes, according to the survey, are also disproportionately white and African-American.
WHERE THEY’RE FROM
The majority of the Class of 2017 hails from the suburbs. Most went to public school, and a plurality in the class call the Northeast home.
Sixty-five percent of respondents said they are from the suburbs, and 27 percent come from urban areas. Eight percent hail from a rural environment.
Forty-one percent of surveyed freshmen are from the Northeast, 15 percent are from the West, 14 percent are from the Midwest, and 8 percent are from the Southwest. Eleven percent said that they are from outside of the United States.
Sixty-one percent of the surveyed freshmen indicated they went to a public high school, and 38 percent said they attended a private one. Less than one percent of the respondents were homeschooled.
According to the survey, students from the Northeast and outside of the United States were disproportionately likely to have attended private school, while freshmen from the Midwest, Southwest, and West disproportionately tended towards a public education before coming to Harvard.
WHERE THEY’RE GOING
The survey shows that incoming freshmen have different ideas about how they want to spend their immediate post-graduate years than the seniors who graduated last spring.
Half of respondents to the freshman survey said they plan to go to graduate or professional school immediately after earning their bachelor’s degree. In a Crimson survey of graduating seniors last spring, however, just 18 percent said they would immediately enroll in graduate school.
Among the least popular employment fields among freshmen is consulting, which according to the survey will attract less than 4 percent of the freshman class. By contrast, 16 percent of seniors surveyed last spring reported that they had found jobs in consulting.
Other employment numbers from the freshman survey were roughly comparable to those reported in last spring’s senior survey. Eight percent of freshman survey respondents predict they will find employment in the finance sector after graduation, while another 8 percent plan to work in technology or engineering.
Many freshman respondents said they expect to be in a different industry in 2027 than in 2017. While only 5 percent plan to work in government or politics immediately after graduation, 15 percent see themselves working in those fields later in their careers. Similarly, while just 6 percent expect to work in the health sector after graduating, nearly a quarter of the freshmen plan to find jobs in the health industry 10 years down the line.
The gender gap was also apparent in career choice. Men were far more likely to hope to eventually work in finance and entrepreneurship than women, while women were much more likely to aspire to careers in nonprofits and public service, health, and media or publishing.
Students who went to public high school were more likely than their private school counterparts to say they intend to seek out careers in education or health 10 years after graduation, and private school students were disproportionately attracted to eventual work in business, finance, and arts, sports, or entertainment.
Despite the diversity in their employment plans, incoming freshmen were remarkably consistent about where they expect to live after graduation. Nearly three fourths of respondents said they thought they would remain in the Northeast after Harvard, and 63 percent of the students who moved to the Northeast to go to Harvard said they expected to stay in the region after graduation.

This summer, while you were off studying abroad, interning at a consulting firm, or just sticking around the Cambridge bubble doing research, Harvard’s neighbors across the river were busy debating proposals for Harvard’s development in Allston and a community benefits package to go alongside it.
 
In July, Harvard filed its 10-year Institutional Master plan for Allston development, which outlines nine proposed construction projects and renovations on Harvard’s property in the Allston-Brighton neighborhood (which, for those of us who don’t walk by the Business School often, is across the Charles River).
The recently proposed master plan includes approximately 1.4 million square feet of new construction and 500,000 square feet of renovation, including a new basketball arena and a hotel. The University hopes to have the master plan approved in October.
Throughout the summer, the Harvard-Allston Task Force also debated the neighborhood’s priorities for a package of community benefits that Harvard will fund alongside its proposed construction in Allston, if it’s approved. The task force has spent many hours doing so, proposing potential benefits ranging from more Soldiers Field Road crossings to transportational and educational improvements.
