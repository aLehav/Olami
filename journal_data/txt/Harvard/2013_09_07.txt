After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jesus Sahagun began working in his uncle’s restaurant in Seattle at the age of 15. Starting as a dishwasher, Sahagun helped his family open multiple restaurants before eventually operating one location for 10 years.
“After that, he decided to sell his business there, come over to a different city, and open up a new restaurant,” said his wife, Areli Sahagun.
The new Mexican eatery Cancun Taqueria y Más, located a few blocks east of Harvard Yard at 1105 Mass. Ave, is the first restaurant that the couple has opened together. Started along with Areli Sahagun’s brother Felix Santana, the taqueria seats 60 and serves traditional Mexican plates, including fajitas, the most popular dish so far.
Cancun Taqueria y Más, which has no relation to Taqueria Cancun in East Boston, joins a variety of existing Mexican offerings in Harvard Square. Yet Areli Sahagun said the restaurant serves unique, authentic dishes that originated in and around Cuautla, Jalisco, Mexico, and were perfected after more than 25 years of business in the American Northwest.
“We’d been coming to Boston for two years back and forth, trying out the food and checking out the Mexican restaurants here,” Areli Sahagun said. “We thought our food could make an impact here, because we noticed that a lot of Mexican restaurants don’t have that authentic taste.”
Areli Sahagun said the restaurant opened in August to test the menu and make any necessary alterations. Though the restaurant remains open, she added that they are waiting to get an officially licensed sign before hosting a grand opening that will feature free tacos.
Cancun Taqueria y Más currently serves lunch and dinner from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day, with extended late-night hours Thursday through Saturday. Students with a Harvard ID can also receive a 10 percent discount on any Mexican dish.
“We feel that we know what we’re doing,” Areli Sahagun said, noting that both she and her husband grew up with families in the restaurant business. “And we hope everyone here at Harvard and in Cambridge likes our food.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Old Quincy has been renamed Stone Hall in honor of a late former member of the Harvard Corporation, Harvard officials announced Saturday afternoon at a ribbon-cutting ceremony outside the newly renovated building.
James F. Rothenberg ’68,  University treasurer and chair of Harvard Management Company’s board of directors, gave a donation to help fund the renovation of the building, which administrators have called a “test project” for Harvard’s ambitious, more than $1 billion House Renewal plan. Rothenberg chose to name the building after Robert G. Stone Jr. ’45, a former HMC director who co-chaired two capital campaigns for the University, the most recent of which ended in 1999 and collected $2.6 billion. Stone died in 2006.
Before the ribbon cutting and the unveiling of an engraving of the building’s new name, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith and Quincy House Co-Master Lee Gehrke thanked donors and others involved in the planning process.
“The name Stone Hall, today, becomes an integral part of the history of Harvard’s House system—a renewed House system,” Smith said in his remarks.
Stone Hall opened for Quincy students at the end of August after 15 months of construction. The newly renovated building is now fully accessible for those with disabilities and features horizontal entryways, elevators, new common spaces, and a mix of multi-person suites and hall single and double bedrooms.
Despite the renovations, the majority of the House’s upperclassmen chose to live in New Quincy this year. Some cited tradition and concern that the new layout might not be the best for parties, among other reasons for not living in the new space.
“It’s nice to have my family back in one area,” Quincy House Co-Master Deborah J. Gehrke said in an interview following the event. During construction on Old Quincy last school year, dozens of displaced Quincy students lived in swing housing around Harvard Square.
She added, “Stone Hall is a great, strong name for Quincy.”
Leverett House Masters Ann B. Georgi and Howard M. Georgi ’68 were among those present at the event Saturday afternoon. Leverett House’s McKinlock Hall is currently undergoing renovation and is scheduled to be completed by next fall. The entirety of Dunster House is slated to be renewed in the 2014-2015 academic year.
“It’s just spectacular,” Ann Georgi said in an interview after the ribbon cutting. “To see how [the renewal has] worked is phenomenal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the first game of the Pieter Lehrer era, the Harvard men’s soccer team fell, 3-0, to the Iona Gaels. The Crimson (0-1) struggled to capitalize on opportunities inside the opponent’s box while the Gaels (1-1-1) were on target with nine of their 14 shots.
“I thought the team worked hard,” Lehrer said. “Obviously it isn’t the result we want but they worked hard and had a great attitude from beginning to end. We had nicks and injuries and with Connor being out that hurt us.”
Iona kicked off the scoring with a 10th minute goal when Samuel Adjei snuck behind the Harvard defense on the right side. Ignacio Magnato’s through ball hit Adjei in the foot and the senior two-touched the ball past diving senior goalkeeper Brett Conrad.
For the next seventy minutes, the teams battled while neither side was able to fully connect. The Crimson routinely broke through on the left side of the defense, with freshman midfielder Stephen Yen playing balls into the box that Harvard could not convert into the equalizer.
In the 34th minute, senior midfielder Ross Friedman ran a give-and-go with sophomore Andrew Chang that ended with Friedman taking one of the Crimson’s three shots on goal—a liner from just outside the box that just missed the right corner of the goal.
Lehrer said that the team’s ability to both control the ball and attack the Gael ballhandlers allowed it to control both field position and flow during the game.
“We were getting good pressure on the ball [late in the half],” Lehrer said. “When we were doing that we were really able to prevent them from getting started. When we do that we both impact that starting position from which we attack and the angle from where we stop their attack.”
With counterattacking being a self-admitted theme for the team before the match, Harvard repeatedly sent long balls down the field in an effort to quickly turn defense into offense. Twice in the middle of the second half, in the 57th and 74th minutes, freshman midfielder Mike Klain and Friedman played through balls into the box only to see offsides penalties called.
However, the Crimson fell victim twice to counterattacks from Iona in a two-minute span late in the second half that put the game away. In the 78th minute, Harvard lost track of Gael midfielder Franklin Castellanos, who found midfielder Ignacio Magnato crossing over the middle. Magnato beat a Crimson defender and sent a screamer into the back corner of the net for a 2-0 lead with barely more than 11 minutes to go.
In the 79th minute, Magnato returned the favor—taking a pass up the sidelines and finding a streaking Castellanos on the right side, who beat Conrad in the right corner of the net for the team’s third goal of the match.
On the day, Castellanos and Magnato—two players that Lehrer identified after the game as the players Harvard had to mark—combined for seven shots, five on goal, with two goals and three assists.
“That’s just our body position being off [letting them get behind us],” Lehrer said. “They are facing out and not facing in and leaking that backside. Minus those types of errors, we played well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson (1-4, 0-0 Ivy) rounded out the weekend splitting its matches on Sunday in its games against Washington & Jefferson and No. 9 UC Irvine. Harvard won its first game of the season against W&J, 17-10, but then fell to the UC Irvine Anteaters to finish out the weekend with a 1-4 record.
“We’re incorporating a lot of young freshman talent,” sophomore Chris Miao said. “So this weekend was all about building our team and building our chemistry. I know we made good strides this weekend, but it was just one step, and you have to keep climbing the stairs.”
UC IRVINE 18, HARVARD 9
In its final game of the weekend, Harvard lost to the Anteaters to finish 1-4 at the Bruno Fall Classic. The Crimson fell behind 4-0 in the first quarter and trailed for the rest of the competition.
Robbie Fluegge led the Crimson offense with three goals, while sophomore Noah Harrison and classmate Blake Lee contributed two apiece. Harrison also had four assists and two steals. Jimmy Woolway anchored the defense with seven saves in goal.
UCI was the third top-ten ranked team that Harvard faced in its matches over the weekend.
“The whole point of having us play five games in two days was so we could build chemistry, get that conditioning in, and for us to really get to know each other before we go and play these tournaments,” freshman Dan Stevens said. “That’s why we play teams like UC Irvine; so that we can understand our limits, how we can push ourselves.”
HARVARD 17, WASHINGTON & JEFFERSON 10
Harvard netted four goals in the first quarter against the Washington & Jefferson Presidents and kept the lead going for the entire game.
Six different Crimson players contributed to the goal total, with Harrison leading the pack with four.
“Noah really contributed both days,” Stevens said. “He had some mental slips, but he really came back. He’s been working his tail off, even before preseason, and you can tell that he works really hard every day.”
Freshman Viktor Wrobel and junior Max Murphy both contributed three goals apiece, and Lee led the team with four assists.
Harvard led 9-3 at halftime and scored five more goals to hold a commanding 14-5 lead going into the final quarter. The Crimson were outscored 5-3 in fourth frame but held on for its first win.
No. 16 BROWN 9, HARVARD 8
In the nightcap Saturday, Brown staged a come-from-behind victory, denying the Crimson a shot at their first victory of the season with a fourth period comeback. Harvard was in control for much of the contest, and entered the fourth holding a 6-3 lead. After the Crimson extended the lead to 7-4, the Bears began their rally. Sophomore Matty Gallas notched the tying goal for Brown, and freshman Warren Smith scored the eventual game-winner. Senior goalie Walker Shockley, who had 11 saves, kept Harvard’s offense at bay, and the Bears’ 12 steals helped him do so.
No. 3 STANFORD 17, HARVARD 5
Earlier, the Crimson took on the Cardinal, which finished the 2012 season ranked fourth nationally. Harvard trailed just 6-3 at halftime, but Stanford then posted seven goals in the third, and added four more in the fourth for the win. The Crimson had just two scores in the second half. Senior Jimmy Field was in goal for Harvard and had 11 saves, and Lee assisted on each of the Crimson’s five goals.
No. 10 ST. FRANCIS 10, HARVARD 7
In Harvard’s season-opening match, it took on the Terriers, which finished third at last year’s NCAA Championships. St. Francis’ freshmen were too much for the Crimson, as Ilija Djuretic posted two scores to go with seven steals while his classmate Lazar Komadinic tallied four goals. Still, the match remained tight, as Harvard trailed 4-3 at the half and 5-4 heading into the fourth period. The Crimson tied the score at seven, but the Terriers pulled away down the stretch. St. Francis held Harvard scoreless during the final two minutes of the game. Harrison had four goals for the Crimson, and Woolway had 11 saves.

The baby squirrel that has been frequenting Kirkland Courtyard of late does not appear to have made any strides in his development of self-dependency. In addition to continued displays of freakish domestication and unnatural levels of comfort around humans, the squirrel is now laying claim to backpacks and does not appear to be leaving any time soon.
We can only hope that his lack of any real-world survival skills will eventually rid us of this problem.
