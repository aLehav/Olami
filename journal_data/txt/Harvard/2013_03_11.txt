After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The mystery of Commencement was resolved. Some were ecstatic, and others disgruntled. The more imaginative amongst us voiced hope that diplomas would be bestowed upon the graduating class in histrionic fashion, perhaps along with a fleet of brand new sport cars. Oprah Winfrey, the University announced, was chosen to deliver this year’s Commencement address.
Shortly thereafter, former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis expressed concerns that a “major purveyor of pseudoscience” would be awarded an honorary Harvard degree. Despite criticisms from Lewis and others, we at the Crimson unequivocally applaud the recognition that will be given to someone who is in many ways a role model and whose work has done much to advance causes that are dear to the Harvard community.
By and large, Lewis’s argument that Oprah is a popularizer of pseudoscience is not an entirely inaccurate one. That this should be relevant to the choice of her as Harvard’s Commencement speaker, however, we contest. True, Oprah has often hosted at her record-breaking talk show persons of questionable opinions about medicine and self-improvement, exposing millions of her viewers to pseudoscientific arguments. She has given space to guests who have advocated such viewpoints as the legitimacy of unconventional hormone therapies to combat the effects of menopause or proposed anti-vaccination stances not backed by cogent public health arguments. Yet such episodes are irrelevant to the occasion of Commencement and are overshadowed by many of Oprah’s other experiences and achievements. Her extraordinary story of determination in the face of adversity, her progress in advancing the status of women and members of ethnic minorities, and her role in abating prejudice against LGBTQ Americans all make her more than qualified to speak on life’s challenges, success, and living a meaningful life in front of Harvard’s graduating class.
Most of us are probably familiar with Oprah’s success story: Born in poverty to a single teenage mother, she overcame the trauma of rape and early pregnancy, went on to become the first and only black female billionaire in the world, and appears repeatedly on Time magazine’s list of most influential people. As early as the 1980s, she defended gay, lesbian, and transgender rights in the United States, harnessing her incredible influence to further the quest for civil rights of millions of LGBTQ Americans.
In light of the enormous impact that Oprah has had on the lives of millions and the role that she plays in public life, that she has popularized views that are at odds with mainstream academia seems an awfully myopic criticism. The University would indeed be hard-pressed to identify any Commencement speaker whose values have never come into conflict with objective scholarship. If one of the goals of a Harvard education is to interact with and learn from those who are different from us, then Oprah, whose work is decidedly non-academic but similarly powerful and valuable, certainly fits the bill. We look forward to hear her talk of confidence, courage, and hardship with the same strength that has characterized her throughout her career as an entertainer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before just about every social event I went to while I was growing up, from scholarship receptions to weddings, my mom would tell me to stop thinking about the way I looked and acted, and instead pay attention to other people. While in this case my mom was saying that I wouldn’t worry about my skirt being wrinkled or having something in my teeth if I was truly focused on what other people were saying, I think she was really sharing a greater point. When you start worrying about other people, you stop worrying so much about yourself.
In light of the Crimson article “Bring Back Banter” that was published last weekend and several other recent pieces about student life and student happiness, perhaps the Harvard student body could use some of my mom’s advice as well. Are we so caught up in our own lives that we’ve forgotten how to be interested in the lives of others?
Before I came to Harvard, I considered myself pretty good at remembering other people’s names. Now I have trouble remembering the names of those I’ve met multiple times. In high school, I made a point to always buy my good friends a birthday present and my more casual friends at least a card. This year I almost forgot my own roommate’s birthday. Before Harvard, I always asked my friends how their game, performance, or show went on the rare occasion I couldn’t actually be there. Now I can hardly remember when my own games are. And that’s the problem. Our own lives are so overwhelming, so busy, so hectic, so scheduled, and so ostensibly important that it seems nearly impossible to fit in the lives of anyone else. However, in making that decision, we not only alienate ourselves from our peers, but we also only have ourselves to worry about.
Now, I’m not saying anyone here needs more worry. I think most of us have more than enough of a burden on our shoulders. What I am saying is that we lose an important part of our own lives when we forget about others’ lives.  Last week, I ran into a casual friend in the dining hall and happened to remember that he was in Math 21a, which just had an exam. When I asked him how the exam went, a look of shock crossed his face. He then broke into a smile as he said, “I can’t believe you remembered that I had an exam.  It went well! Thank you so much for asking me about it!” His response made me wonder if anyone else had remembered that he had an exam. Had his roommates and friends, like so many of us, been so lost in a world of their own that they hadn’t cared about his midterm? At the same time, his response made me smile. In the midst of my pre-midterm stress and never-ending problem sets, it was nice to know that someone’s life was going well. Like my mom always preached, when we concern ourselves with others, our own worries seem so much smaller.
Yes, Harvard is missing banter. Yes, Harvard is missing a healthy emotional culture. But perhaps more so, Harvard is missing compassion and interest in other people. Ironically, by losing interest in others, we also lose the joy and satisfaction that other people’s experiences can bring to our lives. I’m not saying that you need to sit down with each person in your section for 30 minutes each to learn about their lives, but maybe remember the name of the person who sits next to you and ask “George” how his week is going next time you go to class. I’m not saying you need to have front row seats for every one of your roommate’s shows, but at least take 30 seconds to send him or her a “break a leg” text. Maybe you could even go crazy and include a GIF.
Harvard student life is messy and Harvard student happiness is complex, but maybe the solution to our happiness here lies in making our own lives a little bit messier. Life here does not preclude us from being decent human beings to each other. Neither the possibility of having spinach in our teeth nor the difficulty of number seven on our problem set should excuse us from caring about the people who surround us. By way of our interest in each other, the wrinkles in our skirt become unimportant and we find our own happiness. I guess Mom does always know best.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Historically speaking, the resignation of the Pope seems a noteworthy moment in time. A prominent global figure in the religious (and previously the political) sphere, the Pope has long been instrumental in the shaping of society. For Catholics in particular, he is responsible for the central dogma by which they are expected to live their daily lives.
Therefore, when Pope Benedict XVI announced his February 28 resignation from the church (the first willing resignation in six centuries), the news sent shockwaves through the religious community, if not the global community at large. Today we await the imminent election of a papal successor, which theoretically means an opportunity for policy reform, as well as a chance to reignite a waning enthusiasm for Catholicism in nations worldwide.
The sad truth of the matter is, however, that these changes are unlikely to transpire, and even those that do will be of a relatively little magnitude. While there is the possibility for small policy changes such as allowing divorced Catholics to receive communion, or occasionally permitting the use of condoms to prevent AIDS, the candidates considered will likely echo their predecessor’s tendency toward extreme conservativism.
What is more, the reelection of a European Pope will not offer the diversity that may appeal to Catholics in developing nations. While Cardinals Peter Turkson of Ghana and Odilo Scherer of Brazil are strong contenders and would generate much-needed enthusiasm for Catholicism in African and Latin American nations, there is still a significant likelihood that the new Pope will hail from Europe once again. After all, two of the most probable candidates, Archbishop Angelo Scola and Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, are Italian.
By continuing on this same trajectory, then, Pope Benedict XVI’s succession and the upcoming election offer little in terms of historical merit, especially considering the general tendency of modern-day Catholics to disregard papal doctrine. According to studies originally published in the National Catholic Reporter and later cited in The New York Times, over half of American Catholics are in favor of same-sex marriage, and other predominantly Catholic nations such as Argentina, Spain, and Portugal have even legalized the practice. In addition, on a more general scale, the church has seen an increase in the willingness of individuals to formulate their own moral judgments, irrespective of official Vatican teachings.
Nationwide and worldwide, therefore, Catholics have begun to develop a new identity separate from that of the Vatican. As the level of progressivity for modern-day Catholics continues to burgeon, one must call thereby into question the relevancy that a new Pope will have for members of the religious community. While the Pope does oversee the church’s mission of charity, and a new Pope may help with issues such as revamping the church’s image to bypass current associations with sexual assault, the Pope’s status as end-all arbiter of right and wrong has largely dissipated for today’s Catholics. As such, the upcoming papal election portends to be more prescribed than groundbreaking.
Perhaps, however, there is a possibility for change, a possibility to align the beliefs of the church and its constituents once more, but this would require a transformation on behalf of the Vatican. Members of the Catholic community have already made it clear that they are not afraid to be progressive simply because it conflicts with the doctrines emanating from Rome.
In this way, the historical significance of an event such as Pope Benedict XVI’s resignation is largely contingent on its sociopolitical impact. If Catholics continue to ignore the Pope’s teachings, then whatever doctrines are instituted by the newly elected Pope will have little influence on the ensuing religious beliefs of his “followers,” for they have already formulated their own.
Thinking back to the last papal succession in history, the importance of this sociopolitical impact becomes increasingly clear. During this time, Pope Gregory XII ultimately resigned in order to ensure that Martin V would be his successor. This election resultantly ended the Western Schism, a period of religious turmoil in which two men claimed to be the Pope, generating a divide among the church and its citizens. The succession, then, gained historical merit due to the changes it ignited in the church and in society at large.
The fact that this modern papal succession is the first in six centuries, therefore, does not necessarily qualify it as a moment of great historical significance. If the newly elected Pope, however, were to publicly endorse the usage of birth control or recognize the practice of same-sex marriage, then that would be one for the books.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the conspicuous absence of strobe lights and pulsing music on the late-night routes of the Yard-Quad Express prompted rumors a week ago that “the party shuttle” had been shut down for good, this past weekend saw the revelry return in subdued form.
The evening shuttle bus driven by Melvin Washington, Jr. on weekends has been dubbed the “party shuttle” by undergraduates, so named for its blaring external speakers, flashing club-style lights, and student dancing. But this weekend, after Harvard officials suspended the bus’s unorthodox features, Washington turned off the strobe lights, unplugged the external speakers, and instead played loud music from the bus’s speaker system.
Washington said the party shuttle was recently taken under review by administrators after a YouTube video of students dancing on the shuttle surfaced.
The “added features” on the bus have been “put on hold” until an evaluation of the safety of the shuttle can be conducted, Director of Transit and Fleet Management David E. Harris, Jr. wrote in a statement.
“We need to confirm that these additions to the experience of riding the shuttle are not impairing the driver’s ability to operate the vehicle safely, and that the atmosphere is not adversely affecting the ridership,” Harris wrote.
Washington said that he believes it is better for students to have fun in the controlled environment of his bus than out on the streets of Cambridge at night.
“I can’t control these kids. They’re going to do this stuff whether I have a party shuttle or not,” Washington said.
Moreover, Washington said he always strives to keep the students riding on his bus safe during the entirety of the ride, by driving under the speed limit, for example.
“If you’re on my shuttle, I’m going to make sure you’re safe from the time you get on to the time you get off,” he said.
Students and alumni have been quick to come to Washington’s defense. Messages sent over email lists urge students to contact Campus Services to protest the potential shutdown of the party shuttle.
Frequent riders of the party shuttle said they are disappointed about the increased regulation of the beloved bus.
“[The party shuttle] has been a cheery thing after a night out, and I’m definitely for it,” said Blake Zenuni ’13. “Melvin is really into it, and it can be a good thing for safety reasons.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Macky Sall, president of Senegal, delivered the keynote address of the fourth annual Harvard African Development Conference on Friday afternoon. The conference, titled “Visible Change in Africa: One Innovation at a Time”, was organized by seven Harvard schools and lasted through Saturday night.
Sall—who rose from civil servant to president in a little more than a decade—discussed democratic ideals and the developmental challenges that Senegal and the African continent face.
“We must lay down the weapons,” Sall said of Africa. “We must put aside what divides us and continue to talk about what unites us.”
Sall, who spoke through a translator for much of the event, said the primary objectives the continent and Senegal must strive to achieve include improving the design of political institutions, guaranteeing social justice, and upgrading Senegal’s economic status to that of a middle-income nation.
Likening Africa to Asia, he expressed his desire for the entire continent to emerge as an “African tiger.” Accomplishing this, Sall said, would require foreign countries and groups to cease giving handouts and instead invest in Africa, which he referred to as “the next frontier after Asia.”
Since coming into power in 2012, Sall has sought to bolster the democratic process in a west African nation that has been beleaguered by a 50 percent poverty rate and a per capita income of only $2000.
To raise the standard of living, his government is in the process of developing a “Senegalese New Deal,” which includes improved access to basic health care, reduction in payroll taxes, and a new welfare program.
“[The Senegalese New Deal] is also a necessary condition for peace and stability,” Sall said. “All too often, extreme poverty leads to revolts and extremism.”
After these steps, Sall said that he hopes to “go beyond eradicating poverty, to create durable wealth and prosperity for our people in a peaceful, regional context.”
He also encouraged members of the African diaspora to return to their native lands, but first “accept in your head already to go back to your country and serve in the real conditions of your country.”
At the end of Friday’s address, Sall answered questions from audience members. When asked about his plans for the gay community of Senegal—where homosexuality is a criminal offense—he said that though he was a “strong proponent of minority rights”, the government should not “impose certain viewpoints [on] society.”
Sall was welcomed by a conference coordinator, Harvard Kennedy School student and Lowell house tutor Layusa Isa-Odidi ’09.
“Four years ago, we began an experiment: the African Development Conference,” she said, “We really wanted to increase the visibility of the African continent at Harvard.”
Sall came into power after facing adversary in Senegal. In 2008, Sall was ousted from Senegalese politics by his predecessor for demanding improved transparency in the executive branch. He went on to found his own party, the Alliance for the Republic, and was elected president in 2012 in a free and peaceful election validated and praised by western observers.
Prior to his election, his opponent—the incumbent president—amended the Senegalese constitution, increasing the number of presidential terms legally permitted from two to three. Sall, elected to a seven-year term, has since reduced term-length to five years, effective beginning with his own presidency.

The details are unclear, and so are faculty members. Just a day after news broke that Harvard administrators had secretly searched the email accounts of 16 resident deans, professors said the University may have overstepped its bound, calling its own policies into question.
“I teach at Harvard—[I thought] something like this was never going to happen. And I must say that this story came as a real shock to me,” said mathematics professor Wilfried Schmid. Like other professors interviewed Sunday, Schmid said that news reports in the Boston Globe, the New York Times, and The Crimson were the first he had heard of the searches.
Several other professors declined to comment on the record, fearing retaliation by University officials for criticizing them. Requesting anonymity, they explained that the news of the search has already had a chilling effect on the faculty.
At issue is whether resident deans, who are also lecturers, are regulated by the University’s email policy for faculty or for staff. If the deans are considered faculty, then they must be notified before or immediately after a search. Given present information, the policy that pertains to staff is unclear.
While faculty members are protected from unannounced searches like the ones carried out on the deans’ accounts, they said that the incident still sets a dangerous precedent.
Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68, who has been one of the strongest critics of the administration’s handling of the cheating scandal, wrote that his trust in the administration has only diminished in light of the email searches.
“My assumption about the relative risks has now flipped. If something as innocuous as the leakage of the August 16 email justifies reading the email of a dozen faculty members, it is hard to know how low the threshold might be for invasion of our in- and out-boxes,” Lewis wrote in a blog post Sunday.
History and Literature lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy ’93 wrote on his public Facebook page that the search, which administrators said was in the best interest of students, actually worked against them.
“This is disgraceful, even more so than the original cheating scandal, because it involves adults who should know better—really smart, powerful adults, with complete job security,” McCarthy wrote.
McCarthy could not be reached for comment. Other professors said the searches did not come as much of a surprise, as all Harvard email accounts are potentially subject to monitoring by the University.
“I just have long assumed that my emails were subject to searching, and I try to avoid having anything confidential in emails,” said senior lecturer in mathematics Paul G. Bamberg ’63, who lists a non-Harvard email address as his primary correspondence.
Bamberg said that he is “surprised but not shocked” that the University would search the email accounts of faculty members, adding that he believes the administration has a right to look at Harvard email accounts.
Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53 went a step further, saying that as long as it was within the bounds of its own policy, the University made the right choice by searching the deans’ accounts to plug the leak of information.
“I think the administration was trying to protect the privacy of students and that got into the way of the privacy of deans,” Mansfield said. “I think in this case, it’s the student who should have their privacy protected.”
Either way, Schmid and others said that the faculty need to pressure administrators into greater transparency, although just what form such pressure might take is uncertain. The faculty was expected to discuss new academic integrity proposals, including one for a modified honor code, at its monthly meeting in April. Professors said that might be the venue to discuss administrators’ own integrity.
“It is conceivable that there will be some explanation that will make all of this look benign, but I’ll have to wait and see,” Schmid said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an attempt to improve the referenda process ahead of a planned spring ballot, Undergraduate Council representatives voted on Sunday night in favor of legislation that would raise the voting turnout needed to make a referendum binding.
The threshold for referenda results to be considered “binding”—a term for when a referendum becomes official UC policy—was set to at least a 50 percent turnout of the student body.
Previously, a referendum question only needed to be considered if the lower of two thresholds was exceeded: 25 percent of the student body, or the percentage of students who voted in the fall UC representative elections.
Adams representative Antone Martinho ’13, who introduced the amendment to the legislation to change the voter threshold, said the existing policy set the bar too low.
“I think that for passing referenda which are supposed to be binding on us, the representatives of the student body, 25 percent is ridiculous,” Martinho said.
Another amendment eliminated a clause from the initial legislation that would have changed the signature requirement for ballot consideration from 10 percent of the student body to 10 percent of those who voted in the last UC presidential election.
Some representatives expressed serious concern about the proposed change in the number of signatures required for consideration of a question, which would be almost halved as a result of the legislation.
Another change allows the UC to work with a neutral third-party—likely the IOP’s Harvard Public Opinion Project, according to UC Rules Committee Chair Christopher A. Smiles ’15—to ensure questions are not biased.
Additionally, statements and rebuttals to referendum questions will also be published on the UC website and on the ballot.
According to Smiles, these changes were incorporated from looking at other referendum models.
“We were pointed to the California referendum system by Drew Faust and some others,” Smiles said.
The Council meeting also featured two speakers, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris and Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano.
Harris listened to student feedback and answered questions on the recent proposal to change reading period.
Though some representatives expressed their support for the proposal, others were concerned about potential impacts to timely grade reporting and to workload immediately before and after reading period.
Catalano, who spoke on the topic of active shooter response at Harvard, explained HUPD’s procedures should a situation arise and said that HUPD has been working with the MIT, Cambridge, and Boston police departments to develop a common response system.

UPDATED: April 8, 2013, at 4:25 a.m.
Below is the text of an Aug. 16 email that was sent by Secretary of the Administrative Board John “Jay” L. Ellison to his colleagues, including the 16 resident deans. In the email, Ellison offered guidance on how to advise athletes and other students implicated in the Government 1310 cheating scandal. After obtaining the email on Aug. 30, The Crimson published parts of it on Sept. 1, and other media outlets later reported on the email as well, prompting Harvard administrators to secretly search the email accounts of the resident deans in an effort to trace the origin of the leak.
In the note, Ellison uses the acronyms “RWD,” indicating a requirement to withdraw, and “LOA,” meaning a leave of absence.
Ellison's contact information, which was printed in the footer of the letter, has been omitted. 
From: Administrative Board
Sent: Thursday, August 16, 2012 5:46 PM
Cc: Weissman, Ann
Subject: Case Process
Dear Colleagues:
We have had some feedback from students about confusing messages in reference to possible sanctions for the Gov 1310 case. We do not yet know which students might be RWD (see last message) or just placed on probation (or less) and we don’t want to act as if we have a predetermined outcome. I would anticipate that if the Board voted to RWD a student, he or she would be RWD immediately and would be eligible to return next fall. If a student were to take a leave now we would no doubt convert the leave to RWD if we voted that way. However, a student taking a leave now may, in fact, not get RWD and needs to understand that the leave may stand.
The only folks that may want to really consider an LOA are those students who know that they cheated. I think it is important for you to talk to them about being honest and forthcoming and remind them that only they know what happened but that we are working to understand it and except [sic] them to help us do just that.
Fall term athletes may also want to consider taking an LOA before their first game. The reason this matters for athletes is that once they compete one time their season counts and they would lose eligibility if they had to take a year off and return. That said, these students should be sent to Nathan Fry for advice on their options and eligibility—let’s not get into advising students on NCAA rules. Please let me know if you have any questions.
Jay

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 12, 2013, at 3:02 a.m.
For the first time since news broke on Saturday that Harvard administrators had secretly searched the emails of 16 resident deans, top University officials offered an explanation of how and why they accessed the deans’ accounts. The statement, co-signed by Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith and Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, left unanswered questions about whether the Harvard administration broke its own policy by accessing email accounts without notifying their owners.
After the statement’s release Monday morning, FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal declined to provide further comment on the statement. Neal would not address whether or not the email accounts of resident deans—who are not technically faculty but enjoy some faculty privileges—are subject to the privacy policy of faculty or that of staff.
Some have suggested that Harvard’s culpability in the incident hinges on this question. The FAS email policy protects professors from unannounced searches of their accounts. If faculty rules govern administrative access to resident deans’ email accounts, Harvard would have broken its policy by failing to notify the resident deans in advance of the search.
The staff policy, however, authorizes Harvard officials to access a staff member’s emails and other electronic files “at any time” and “for any business purpose” without asking the employee. If those rules apply for resident deans, Harvard would not have deviated from its policy.
History professor Maya R. Jasanoff ’96 said the statement also did not answer questions about what level of privacy faculty and others can expect from administrators.
“While the statement gave specific answers to specific questions, the fact that email accounts held by figures on the Harvard campus—who teach in the classroom and have close relationships with students—were secretly probed in this way, raises concerns for all of us about the limits around our privacy,” Jasanoff said.
Monday’s statement said that Smith and the University’s General Counsel approved the search last fall with the support of Hammonds in an attempt to track a leak of information regarding the Government 1310 cheating case.
Administrators became aware of the leak when a confidential email, originally sent to resident deans advising them on how to counsel students implicated in the cheating investigation, was obtained by The Crimson after the cheating scandal broke.
“The disclosure of a confidential board conversation led to concerns that other information—especially student information that we have a duty to protect as private—was at risk,” the statement said.
Smith and Hammonds wrote that they first attempted to identify the source of the leak in interviews and committee meetings before the email search occurred.
After a second piece of information—the details of a tiered punishment scheme allegedly devised by administrators for the cheating cases—was leaked to The Crimson and other media outlets a week later, administrators redoubled their efforts to trace the leak. After the continuing investigation proved unfruitful, they decided on “a very narrow, careful, and precise subject-line search” of the resident deans’ email accounts.
The search was conducted by Harvard University Information Technology and ultimately located the email with the subject line in question, identifying the resident dean who sent it. After speaking with that dean, administrators came to the conclusion that the leak was inadvertent and no action was taken, according to the statement. The other resident deans remained uninformed about the searches until late last week, when the Boston Globe approached the University in advance of an article published Saturday evening.
Administrators have come under fire from faculty members, many of whom believe the University overstepped its bounds in searching the deans’ accounts without prior notification—regardless of whether or not such action violated University policy. While professors said that Monday’s statement may have alleviated some concerns, they still feel that trust between the University and its faculty has been strained.
“I think the issue I’m concerned about is that people in a university should not be trolling emails,” said history professor Charles S. Maier ’60. “Even just the subject line—it’s considered a kind of searching procedure that we didn’t think we worried about at this university.”
Professors suggested that the email searches could be symptomatic of a larger shift in the balance of power away from faculty and toward the administration. Though they were careful not to tie the email searches too closely with that perceived shift, they said that a recent string of top-down decisions have left faculty uncertain about their role in the University hierarchy.
“The concern that I think many faculty members feel has to do with questions of trust,” Jasanoff said.
Government professor Theda R. Skocpol, former dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, put it more bluntly.
“Whoever designed this entire cheating scandal in all of its many investigative aspects fits better at the Hoover era FBI than at a modern university,” she wrote in an email.
In their statement on Monday, Smith and Hammonds justified Harvard’s actions by saying that administrators were “operating without any clear precedent for the conflicting privacy concerns,” and ultimately based the decision not to notify all the resident deans of the search to protect the privacy of a resident dean who had made an “inadvertent error.”
“We understand that others may see the situation differently, and we apologize if any Resident Deans feel our communication at the conclusion of the investigation was insufficient,” the statement said.
Faculty members interviewed for this story said they were uncertain how faculty might react to the incident, but that any formal discourse will likely come at April’s faculty meeting.
Though it is not on the agenda, Jasanoff and classics professor Richard F. Thomas said they expect the searches will be discussed in the biweekly Faculty Council meeting scheduled for Wednesday.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 12, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified the second piece of information that led administrators to decide to search the emails of resident deans. That second leak was a report of a tiered punishment scheme that administrators had allegedly devised for the cheating cases, not Government 1310 instructor Matthew B. Platt’s original May 14 complaint letter to the Administrative Board.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 11, 2013, at 9:43 p.m.
The Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers reached a tentative agreement on the details of a new contract with the University, ending the longest negotiations in the union’s history.
The tentative contract, which is pending ratification by HUCTW members, includes a first-year wage increase of 3.4 percent for a typical HUCTW member with at least one year of service at the University. It also calls for two more salary increases at the same rate in 2013 and 2014.
The rate of the salary increases was one of the most debated topics between the two sides in the negotiations. HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger said that he thought the wage increase, which is smaller than those during previous boom years with higher inflation but larger than those the union saw in the 2010 agreement right after the financial crisis, was very appropriate for this point in time.
“Our members, more than anything else, have cared about having some meaningful real wage growth, and that is in there for sure,” Jaeger said.
Leaders on both sides said they are satisfied with the result of the negotiations.
“We are very pleased to have reached an agreement that is fair for the University and the members of the HUCTW,” Harvard’s Vice President for Human Resources Marilyn Hausammann wrote in an email to The Crimson. “We value and recognize the important role that HUCTW members play every day at Harvard, and we look forward to moving ahead together with the work of the University.”
One issue that remains without a solution is healthcare benefits. The tentative agreement refers all unresolved health care issues to a newly created HUCTW-Harvard Health Care Negotiating Group, which will meet frequently in an attempt to find a mutually agreeable solution.
While Jaeger said he believes the negotiating group will be able to come to an agreement, he recognizes that health care is a difficult and long-term problem.
“I don’t think it’s going to be quick or easy...but at least we’ve got a new framework and a new way of thinking about it and maybe some hopeful and positive attitudes coming out of this agreement,” Jaeger said.
If ratified by HUCTW members in a vote on April 2, the new contract will go into effect retroactively for July 1, 2012, and will expire on September 30, 2015.
HUCTW is planning meetings with its members in the next few weeks to ensure that they understand the details of the new contract before their ratification vote on April 2. Jaeger said he is confident that the union's members will approve the contract.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend has seen Crimson athletes in action on the national scene. Junior Rebecca Nadler tried her hand at defending her title in skiing this week and three female athletes competed at the NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships in Arkansas, marking the first time since 2009 that Harvard has sent women to the championships. As these sportswomen return to campus, the Crimson looks ahead to other athletes seeking national success in the month of March.
Wrestling
The Harvard team has just finished competing at the 2013 EIWA Championships and on Mar. 21 several athletes will be travelling to Iowa to strive for national glory. Leading the pack will be All-American Steven Keith. The Senior’s 102 career wins currently rank him seventh in Harvard history and he will be looking to build off his eighth place finish in 2012.
 
Fencing
This Sunday Mar. 10 will see Harvard’s male and female fencers heading to St John’s University to compete at the NCAA Northeast regional. Success there will enable qualify individuals for the championships in San Antonio in two weeks time. As it did in 2012, the Crimson will be trying to send the maximum of twelve fencers to the championships. Given the national title is awarded as a coed team, every fencer will be needed to increase the chances of national team glory for Harvard.
 
Swimming
While the Crimson tries to end Princeton’s four year reign over the Ivy Championships this weekend, individuals will be looking to post NCAA ‘A’ qualifying times to guarantee them a spot at the NCAA Championships in Indianapolis at the end of the month. Sophomore Chuck Katis has already booked his ticket. The breaststroker is currently ranked in the top ten nationally over both 100 and 200 meters and will be seeking to prove himself on the national stage.
 
Women’s Hockey
Despite falling in the ECAC finals to Cornell, the Harvard squad will travel across town to Boston College on March 16th for the first round of the NCAA tournament. The game is their first appearance since the ‘09-10 season, when this year’s senior class fell to Cornell in the first round as freshmen. The winner of this match-up will travel to Minneapolis for the women’s Frozen Four.
 
Men’s Basketball
Yes, they’re going dancing again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Only a handful of seconds had passed since he had learned his team was returning to the NCAA tournament when Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker burst into the Lavietes Pavilion lounge.
Amaker hurried to senior Christian Webster and locked his captain in an embrace.
In their four seasons together, Amaker and Webster have accomplished more than any player-coach combo in Harvard history, namely three Ivy League championships and two NCAA tournament berths.
But while Amaker will presumably return to Cambridge for a shot at another Ivy League championship and another NCAA tournament berth, this is the end of the line for Webster.
The Crimson’s lone senior, Webster played his final two games at Lavietes Pavilion over the weekend.
“It hasn’t really hit me yet to be honest,” Webster said after the Crimson’s 65-56 victory over Cornell on Saturday night. “I couldn’t have drawn it up any better—leaving the gym right now knowing that we are going to the tournament, having won the championship outright. There’s no better way for me to leave this thing.”
Just a week ago, though, Webster and the Crimson’s chances of ending the season on top seemed bleak. Facing Penn last Saturday, Webster and his teammates walked off the court of the Palestra hanging their heads following a 75-72 loss that gave Princeton sole possession of first place in the league standings.
Entering the final stretch of Ivy League play, Harvard needed a pair of victories over the weekend coupled with a Princeton loss to extend its season.
The Crimson got more than that.
The Tigers fell in back-to-back road contests at Yale and Brown while Harvard took care of business.
After being honored at a pre-game ceremony on Friday, Webster scored two points in the Crimson’s 56-51 win over Columbia. On Saturday, he totaled seven points on five shots in a 65-56 win.
The wins gave Webster 89 on his career, more than any other player in Harvard history.
“Three Ivy titles in his four years and a captain and the winningest player in the history of Harvard basketball, you can’t say enough,” Amaker said. “He’s a guy that if you know him you are very happy and wishing good things for him.”
In his final season, Webster has averaged 8.4 points and 3.0 rebounds per game while shooting 36.7 percent from beyond the arc. He’s also come up in the clutch for the Crimson on a number of occasions, most notably against Dartmouth when he hit three three-pointers in the final 93 seconds to force overtime.
But perhaps more important to the Crimson’s success has been his role off the court. After Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry withdrew from the university in September, the Crimson was left with two vacancies at the captain positions
This left Webster to not only cope with the loss of some of his closest friends, but also to serve as the Crimson’s primary leader.
“For me personally, those were my best friends,” said Webster, who was named captain along with junior Laurent Rivard. “We had been captains at the high school level but not in college so it was unexpected and unchartered waters.”
While many expected the Crimson to struggle adjusting to their new roster and new leadership, Harvard exceeded expectations. Picked to finish second to Princeton in the Ivy League preseason poll, the Crimson topped the Tigers convincingly in Cambridge and will finish at least a game ahead of Princeton for its third straight title.
But Webster still has one more milestone to reach before it’s all said and done. The senior needs three more points to reach 1,000 on his career.
Thanks to the Crimson’s weekend wins, Webster will get a chance to pick up those last three—in the NCAA tournament.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a bus heading back to Harvard from NCAA Northeast Regionals in Queens, N.Y. on Sunday night, Crimson coach Peter Brand read the names of the 11 Harvard fencers who qualified for the NCAA Championships to be held later this month.
St. John’s University hosted the regional tournament, which featured fencers from 18 different schools. Three of the universities were Top 10 varsity programs, including Harvard, St. John’s, and Columbia.
The Crimson had five medalists at the end of the tournament, most notably sophomore foilist Brian Kaneshige, who snagged the gold medal in his weapon group.
“[Kaneshige] definitely deserved it,” sophomore Emma Vaggo said. “He’s a great fencer, and he’s been working really hard this year and doing really well traveling to world cups…. He did a great job and fenced really well.”
Kaneshige, heading into his final round with a tight score of 6-6 (+11), clinched the title after going 10-1 (+32). The sophomore edged out Eli Schenkel of St. John’s, who received the silver medal.
Freshman foilist Michael Woo medaled as well, registering a 19-4 (+48) finish to claim the bronze medal and join his teammate on the podium.
“It feels great,” Wood said. “I didn’t really have super-high expectations. I’m just there to fence and do my best.”
The freshman entered his final bouts 11-1, higher than that of Kaneshige when he headed into his closing bouts of the day.
“It’s always really fun and really positive looking forward,” Vaggo said. “We’ve got three freshmen who qualified for NCAAs, which is really strong of them. You’re always nervous during regionals because you’re not used to fencing all day, but they all fenced really well and were strong physically and mentally, and we’re all excited to have them on our team.”
Junior Lucas Lin also represented Harvard in the foil event, ranking 14th at the end of the day.
Women’s foil also claimed a medal, with junior Alexandra Kiefer receiving the bronze. The podium finish marked Kiefer’s second career medal in the NCAA Regional tournament. Senior foilist Katherine Chou finished 14th.
Men’s epée fencers failed to clinch a medal, but sophomore Peregrine Badger grabbed a spot in the top 10 and a nod to the NCAA Championships tournament.
Vaggo clinched the silver in the women’s epée event, her second career regional medal.
“It was such a long day,” Vaggo said. “To be honest, I think we are all just really happy to be done, but I pushed a little bit more to win the last bout to make sure I would end up going to NCAAs.”
Freshman Nina van Loon and senior Felicia Sun finished seventh and ninth, respectively.
“In my bouts, personally, I wasn’t that satisfied with how I fenced today, but I’m really excited to qualify,” van Loon said. “It was a really long day, and you get really mentally tired. Everyone who won their events today, I’m blown away by their performances. I have no idea how they managed to stay strong like that.”
Men’s sabre came up with a medal, while women’s sabre failed to do so. Sophomore Alexander Ryjik took to the medalists’ podium after securing the silver, while his teammate, junior Eric Arzoian, fell just shy of medaling after finishing in fourth place.
Although women’s sabre did not bring home a medal, sophomore Kara Lee and freshman Aliya Itzkowitz clinched top-10 finishes at fifth and sixth, respectively.
“I think one of our strengths is that we have a really organized schedule, and everyone really works hard and supports each other,” Woo said. “Everyone cares about the sport and really shows how much they care by working hard in practice….  I think we’re just going to keep at it like that. I think knowing that NCAAs are coming up, people are going to give a little extra effort.”
The 11 national qualifiers will travel to San Antonio, TX the weekend of Mar. 21-22.
“I think we’re all going to try to work really hard to fence a lot,” Vaggo said. “Looking forward, we are trying not to think too much about [NCAA Championships] but also work hard…maybe work on some things that we found this weekend that weren’t working for us. We’re staying positive, and we’re all really excited to go.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team has run out of second chances.
The Crimson’s turbulent season came to an abrupt close Sunday as three unanswered Dartmouth goals in the second period helped the Big Green past the Crimson, 6-3, in Hanover, N.H.. After conceding game one to Harvard (10-19-3, 6-14-2 ECAC) on Friday, Dartmouth (15-12-5, 9-9-4) took the final two contests of the first-round series to advance to the ECAC Tournament quarterfinals.
“It’s frustrating for us because I felt that our guys really battled right to the end,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We did a lot of good things…. We felt that the game was headed in our direction after the first period.”
Dartmouth will face Union in Schenectady, N.Y., for the next round of conference play on Friday. Meanwhile, Harvard will have to wait for next year. The Crimson, hampered by injuries and departures, struggled throughout the regular season and finished last in the ECAC for the first time in program history. But recent wins against Boston University and No. 1 Quinnipiac had signaled a possible late-season push.
“We were excited coming in,” Donato said after Sunday’s loss. “It’s no secret, a couple of the things we dealt with. I was proud of the way we finished the last three or four weeks of the season. But there’s no question that we didn’t end up where we would have liked to given where we thought we were headed at the beginning of the season.”
On Sunday, two goals less than a minute apart allowed the Big Green to jump out to a 3-1 lead early in the second frame.
Over six and a half minutes into the second period, Dartmouth freshman forward Tim O’Brien collected a deflected shot from teammate Mike Keenan and, uncontested, put the Big Green’s second goal past the right pad of a perplexed Raphael Girard, who was looking in the opposite direction in an attempt to locate the puck. Forty-nine seconds later, Eric Robinson batted a puck out of the air and between the pipes to give Dartmouth a 3-1 lead.
After the first period, the Crimson appeared to head into the locker room with game-changing momentum after a strike from senior forward Luke Greiner with less than 32 seconds left in the opening frame. But Dartmouth quickly caught fire in the second, drawing even 2:28 into the second period off a successful stuff attempt from freshman forward Brad Schierhorn.
The Big Green expanded on its lead early in the third as freshman forward Nick Bligh connected on a drop pass from classmate Connor Dempsey for a one-timer at the top of the right faceoff circle. Down 4-1, the Crimson pulled Girard in favor of freshman goaltender Peter Traber, who made his eighth career appearance in net.
“We lost sight of the puck there a couple of times early,” Donato said. “I think we made mistakes all the way up and down the ice. But at that point, I think we needed a change just as much for the rest of the team than really pointing the finger [at Girard].”
Harvard twice drew within two goals in the closing minutes as the Crimson outshot Dartmouth, 18-8, in the final frame. But each time, Dartmouth had an answer.
With less than 13 minutes left in regulation, senior forward Luke Greiner picked up a loose puck high in the Big Green slot to score his second goal of the game. Dartmouth senior forward Dustin Walsh responded seven minutes later, bouncing a puck off the back of Traber from behind the Harvard net to put the Big Green up, 5-2, with less than six minutes left in regulation.
In the closing minutes, freshman Crimson defenseman Desmond Bergin converted on a 6-on-4 opportunity after Harvard pulled Traber for an extra attacker on the power play. But with less than two minutes left, Schierhorn capped off a Dartmouth victory with an empty netter.
A 2-1 win on Friday put the Crimson on the brink of advancing to the ECAC Tournament quarterfinals for the fourth straight season. But for the second time in four years, the Crimson dropped the last two games of a series in Hanover to fall to a higher-ranked Dartmouth squad. Harvard lost game two and game three of the 2010 quarterfinals at Dartmouth.
Sunday was the final collegiate game for five Harvard seniors. Greiner finished the night with two goals and one assist while classmate and linemate Alex Fallstrom recorded his final NCAA point with an assist on Bergin’s goal. Captain Danny Biega, forward Marshall Everson, and defensemen Brendan Rempel also concluded their careers with the Crimson. Senior forward Connor Morrison was out of the lineup with an injury.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Co-captain Walter Peppelman took the mat Saturday to compete in the EIWA Championships final in the 157-pound weight class. After having early success in the tournament, Peppelman met his match in Joseph Napoli of Lehigh, who edged out the senior in a 5-0 decision to claim the title. The match was Peppelman’s second career final at the tournament.
Peppelman not only left the tournament with a second place finish, but the senior also got a nod for nationals later this month.
“I thought I had a pretty good weekend up until today, and then I didn’t perform as well as I would have liked to,” Peppelman said. “I ended up losing a tough one in the final, which stung a little bit, but I look forward to getting that win back in nationals.”
Although Harvard fell shy of its goal of being in the top five at the EIWA Championships this weekend in New Brunswick, N.J., the Crimson left the tournament with eight place-winners and a seventh place finish, its highest placing since 2007.
Harvard sent one other wrestler to the finals on Saturday—sophomore James Fox. At 197 lbs., Fox competed against Micah Burak, who has had four career EIWA finals appearances. The Crimson sophomore suffered two takedowns in the first and second periods and allowed Burak to rack up riding time in the final frame. Fox finished as the runner-up with Burak securing a 6-3 decision.
“I wrestled him before, a couple weeks ago, and lost to him,” Fox said. “I had a good idea of what he was going to do when I went into the match. My main goal was to stay out of tie-ups, keep moving my hands and feet…. Unfortunately I didn’t completely accomplish that, which is why I lost to him. I wrestled hard for all seven minutes, so I was proud of myself for that, and I had the game plan in my head, but the execution wasn’t fully there, so that was a little disappointing.”
Fox may have finished without a title, but the sophomore will be traveling to Des Moines, Iowa for the NCAA Championships along with Peppelman and co-captain Steven Keith.
“At the end of the day, I’m happy,” Fox said. “I qualified for nationals, and I was wrestling in the finals…. I look forward to wrestling at nationals, and if I see [Burak] again, hopefully it’ll be a different story.”
The next highest place-winner on the Harvard team was Keith, who secured a fourth-place finish at 141 and was the first Crimson qualifier for the national tournament.
Keith advanced to the semifinals after definitive decisions of 6-0 and 9-3 over wrestlers from Columbia and Lehigh, respectively. The senior was unable to secure a championship final appearance after losing a 6-3 decision to Penn’s CJ Cobb.
“At the end of the day, we have three national qualifiers,” Peppelman said. “Steven is qualifying for his fourth national tournament, which is something pretty rare in our history.”
The Crimson almost sent a fourth wrestler to the NCAA tournament in freshman Jeffrey Ott. At 125, Ott clinched fifth place, coming one win shy of qualifying for nationals. The freshman came out of the gates strong, forcing a technical fall in his opening match against Hunter Wood of Army, and earning an 18-3 decision.
Ott’s second match results did not swing in the freshman’s favor, when No. 4 David Terao of American pinned him for the win.
The freshman went on to secure two decisions in the consolation bracket, advancing him to the match for an appearance in the third place match and an automatic bid for the national tournament on Saturday. Ott lost a 4-3 decision, finishing the tournament in fifth-place after securing a 13-0 major decision over Wood.
“A lot of our guys placed,” Fox said. “I think we wrestled well as a team, especially at the beginning of the tournament, but we got to the second day, and I think we were worn out a little bit and not capitalizing on all the opportunities…. By the fourth or fifth match, you’re pretty banged up and sore, and it’s tough to perform at 100 percent.”
The other Harvard wrestlers who placed in the EIWA Championships include freshman Devon Gobbo, who placed seventh, and senior Shay Warren, junior Cameron Croy, and sophomore David Ng who all snagged eight place finishes.
“We’re just focusing on little things, small little tweaks,” Fox said. “Looking to attack the opposite side of the body that is not our strong side…little things like that will go a really long way. We have a week and a half to keep working hard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Going into the third event of the women’s pentathlon at this weekend’s NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships, freshman Martina Salander found herself sitting in 12th place in the 16-person competition.
The rookie needed to put together a stellar finish in the last three events to even be in contention for the national title in the event.
Then, with a single, personal-best heave of the shot put, Salander catapulted herself into third place.
On the first of her three attempts, Salander tossed the shot 14.23 meters, 1.68 meters further than her closest competitor would manage.
The mark earned her 809 points, while no other athlete netted greater than 700 in the event.
“[Last Monday in practice,] she had a series of eight or nine throws that were above her PR,” Harvard multi-events coach Kebba Tolbert said. “I couldn’t say that she was definitely going to throw 14.20…but I knew that she was going to PR and give herself a shot to score a lot of points in that event.”
The freshman went on to set a new Ivy League record in the pentathlon, tallying 4209 points in the event en route to a fifth place finish and recognition as a first-team All-American. Salander, whose previous best point total in the event was 4138 points, became the first multi-event All-American in Crimson history.
In addition to her impressive outing in the shot put, Salander jumped 5.85 meters in the long jump, which ties for the fifth best in school history. She went on to record a personal-best time in the 800 meter run, clocking in at 2:19.36.
“The best multi-event athletes have balanced performances,” Tolbert said. “If you have one really bad performance, it can really hurt you in the overall scores…so we were just trying to keep doing what we’d been doing all year.”
In total, three Crimson athletes—all from the Ivy-champion women’s squad—earned qualifying bids to nationals by placing in the top 16 in the nation in their respective events. Salander was joined by junior co-captain Adabelle Ekechukwu, who earned her bid by breaking the Ancient Eight record in the weight throw, and sophomore middle distance runner Erika Veidis, whose qualifying time of 2:05.70 is the second fastest mark in the 800-meter in school history.
Veidis punched her ticket to Fayetteville at last weekend’s Last Chance Meet, which was hosted by Columbia at the Armory Track and Field Center. The sophomore’s qualifying time was 15th out of the 16 competitors, which likely meant that she would have to set a new personal record if she hoped to be one of the eight women in the event finals.
“The goal was to basically recreate the race from last weekend, where I just sat on a pretty hot pace and then was able to close,” Veidis said. “But I guess that’s trickier when the whole field is trying to do the same thing.”
Assigned to the second heat of the preliminaries, Veidis toed the line against runners from perennial track and field powerhouses LSU and Oregon.
The sophomore finished in sixth place in her heat, crossing the finish line in 2:06.69, almost exactly a second slower than her personal-best time. When the results from both heats were compiled, Veidis’ time earned her 10th place, just 0.54 seconds short of a spot in the finals.
“It was a really aggressive race, which you would expect in the national championship 800,” Veidis said. “There was lots of elbowing and cutting off…. Usually I can run confidently and aggressively, but for some reason I just got jostled around and I wasn’t able to make it up after I got stuck in a bad position.”
Away from the track, Ekechuwku was the first Harvard competitor to face off against the nation’s best, as the women’s weight throw was the meet’s first field event. In one of her first three throws, the junior needed to be in the top nine to advance to the event finals.
Though Ekechukwu, who is also a Crimson arts and multimedia editor, opened up the competition with a solid 19.64-meter heave, she would not improve on the mark in either of her next two attempts and finished in 12th place. Her performance earned her second-team All-American status, making the co-captain the first thrower on the women’s team to garner the distinction.
“It’s a very, very high quality field and it’s a very intense competition,” Tolbert said. “To be able to come in and place higher than you were ranked coming in, that means you handled the pressure fairly well…. To get through to the national championship was a huge step for our program.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After opening the season 2-3, the Harvard softball team dropped three games this weekend, going 1-3 in its second tournament of the season, the Winthrop Adidas Invitational in Rock Hill, S.C.. Runs were at a premium during the weekend, and the Crimson (3-6) found itself playing catch-up for most of the competition.
“I think our offense needs to develop a sense of urgency,” sophomore infielder Katie Lantz said. “[We need to] work on scoring first, scoring more runs, and stringing together more hits.”
WINTHROP 5, HARVARD 4
The weekend finale pitted Harvard against Winthrop. In a back-and-forth game, with multiple lead changes, the Crimson ultimately fell in the bottom of the seventh on a walk-off home run, giving freshman Morgan Groom her second loss of the season.  With the loss, Harvard failed to at least split a day’s worth of games for the first time this season.
Harvard only had three extra base hits all weekend, two of which were home runs by junior infielder Kasey Lange.
That said, the 1-3 weekend easily could have been a 3-1 weekend in many of the player’s minds, with the difference coming down to a few plays.
“The pitchers had some great moments, definitely had some good games [and] the infield was a force for the team,” Lantz said. “I thought that we had some close games that we could have won.”
The Crimson have played just two weekends this season, so many of the players are still stiff from the cold Cambridge winters where they are forced to practice inside the bubble on the football field. Many teams, such as Winthrop, have played as many as 22 games already.
‘The more we play the better we do,” Olson said. “Just that confidence knowing that no matter what pitch the pitcher pitches we can succeed [will make the difference].”
WESTERN ILL. 9, HARVARD 1
Against Western Illinois, Harvard fell behind 2-0 in the top of the first inning on a two-out home run. After scoring one run in the first to cut the deficit in half, the Crimson failed to produce another hit, going down 9-1.
“There were definitely moments of greatness,” junior captain Shelbi Olson said. “We just need to bring it together.… We definitely weren’t happy with our performance overall.”
HARVARD 5, N.C. A&T 1
After barely falling to Delaware State, Harvard rebounded by topping North Carolina A&T. The Crimson sent Groom to the mound against the Bulldogs. After falling behind 1-0 by surrendering two doubles in the second inning, Groom settled down to complete the game and strike out eight in a 5-1 victory.
It was Groom’s first victory pitching for the team. Lange hit a three-run home run to give the Crimson the lead for good.
DELAWARE ST. 5, HARVARD 4
In its first game in the Winthrop Adidas Invitational, the Crimson fell behind, 4-1, to Delaware State during the first inning. Although it clawed back to tie the game in the top of the seventh, Harvard was foiled by a walk-off base hit in the bottom of the inning. Lange hit a solo home run for the Crimson in the loss.
Next weekend, in its final weekend tournament trip of the season, the Crimson will travel to California for the San Diego Classic II. Harvard will face some of the best competition it will see all season, including Long Beach State and San Jose St. Many of the players are from California, so there is definitely an excitement to play in front of a home-state crowd.
“California is great because the majority of our team is from out west, so we always have a lot of fans,” Lantz said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the third time in as many years, the No. 6/7 Harvard women’s hockey team came tantalizingly close to an ECAC championship, only to watch it slip away once again.
“That one stung,” co-captain Jillian Dempsey said. “But it is amazing to know that we have another chance to make a go at things.”
Despite falling to Cornell, 2-1, in the tournament final, the news was not all bad for the Crimson (24-3, 17-3-2 ECAC), who took home individual honors and an all-important NCAA tournament berth.
After getting to the ECAC final by beating Clarkson and Dartmouth, Harvard fell to the Big Red in a trying back-and-forth affair. The regular-season champions outshot the Crimson, 34-19, en route to their third ECAC title in four years.
Despite being on the losing end, freshman Emerance Maschmeyer took home some hardware. The goaltender was named the tournament’s Most Outstanding Player. Maschmeyer, who has seen the bulk of the playing time lately, allowed four goals in four tournament games while recording two shutouts.
“She’s been incredible for us all year,” Dempsey said.  “We set the bar really high and she has done more than we asked of her.”
Goaltending has been a Crimson strong suit all season. Co-captain Laura Bellamy and freshman Maschmeyer have combined to record a 1.14 goals against average. The combined mark is good for second in the country.
“They made the job easier on me,” Maschmeyer said of her teammates.
The freshman was beat with just minutes left in regulation. The go-ahead goal came off the stick of Jessica Campbell who was setup after the Harvard defense blocked a shot in close. Maschmeyer was out of position to make the stop after she came up to stop Campbell’s first attempt.
The opportunity came on the man-advantage after junior forward Kaitlin Spurling was called for interference.
Cornell capitalized against a Crimson penalty kill that had staved off five power plays and a five-on-three in the first two periods.
“Our penalty kill was great,” Dempsey said. “We always have a lot of confidence in it. Tonight, it was about discipline. It was about grinding it out.”
The nation’s best unit had experienced tremendous success, stopping its opponents on the 21 attempts prior to the broken play.
Harvard could manage just one shot to Cornell’s 10, but Maschmeyer handled each Cornell advance in a scoreless second period that featured multiple power-play opportunities.
“We played hard and put ourselves in a position where we still have a chance,” Dempsey said.
The Crimson regained its composure in the third period, edging its opponents 11-10 in shots on net. With the chance to take the lead, Harvard mounted several offensive opportunities in odd-man situations.
“It was competitive all the way to the very end,” Dempsey said. “In the end, it didn’t bounce our way,”
The lone Crimson point of the night came on a Samantha Reber find. The sophomore won the faceoff and tapped the puck along to sophomore forward Hillary Crowe, who wristed it toward Cornell’s Lauren Slebodnick. The equalizer bounced off the goaltender’s pads before arcing into the back of the net.
Before the goal, two third-period power plays presented opportunities for Harvard. The Crimson took four shots on net including one from freshman forward Mary Parker. Parker led the way with five shots on net.
“It’s of course frustrating but we should be proud of how we played,” Maschmeyer said. “And we have a lot to look forward to.”
The loss meant that Harvard had to wait it out to see whether it would make the NCAA tournament, which culminates in Minnesota.
Soon after the loss, it was revealed that Harvard’s resume was strong enough to nab one of the four at-large bids in the eight-team field.
The environment was raucous for a Crimson squad that made the trip up to Cornell’s Lynah Rink.
“It gave us a lot of momentum,” Maschmeyer said of the atmosphere. “Cornell tried to pack the house tonight.  It was just another reason to go out there and give it our all.”
Harvard will play No. 4 Boston College in next weekend’s quarterfinals.
“We just got to stick to what we know,” Maschmeyer said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s hockey team earned a spot in the ECAC championship game for the first time since 2008 on Saturday afternoon at Lynah Rink. The No. 6/7 Crimson (24-3, 17-3-2 ECAC) defeated No. 5 Clarkson (28-9, 18-4), 4-2, despite being outshot by the Golden Knights in the semifinals matchup.
Clarkson’s high-powered offense was responsible for two of Harvard’s six losses this season, beating the Crimson by a score of 3-1 in both games. But the third time was the charm on Saturday, as freshman goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer—who was named tournament MOP—made 26 saves to help the team secure its chance to battle for the league title.
“Everybody was ready, everybody played their role, and we had a lot of good energy,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “We played Harvard hockey.”
The Crimson tallied three goals before the Golden Knights could convert any of their 28 attempts on net. Freshman forward Mary Parker put the Crimson on the board just two minutes into the first period. Parker’s goal came after the puck was deflected off of a Clarkson defender’s helmet and into the net.
“Tonight we were just ready to go out there and play the way that we can play and take it to them,” co-captain Jillian Dempsey said. “We were fired up and didn’t let anything get in our way.”
Harvard was offensively dominant in the second period of play, outshooting the Golden Knights, 10-4. But it wasn’t until late in the second frame that Dempsey gave the Crimson its next goal off of a power play. Sophomore Sarah Edney sent the first shot, after a Clarkson hokoing penalty, rocketing towards the goal, giving Dempsey the chance to find the back of the net on a rebound.
“Our power play has been great the past two games, but in the beginning [of the season] we were struggling,” Dempsey said. “We really needed that [goal] at that point in the game.”
Harvard’s offensive momentum carried over to the beginning of the final period of play. Golden Knight goaltender Erica Howe, who was recently named ECAC goaltender of the year, continued to be showered with shots on net. Only three minutes into the frame, freshman forward Miye D’Oench, assisted by Parker, notched Harvard’s third unanswered goal of the game.
“We got to the net [and] took some tough shots for the goaltender to handle,” Stone said. “She was off balance and had to go side-to-side, so we made it tough on her.”
But Clarkson began to chip away at the Crimson lead with a goal from Jamie Lee Rattray. The Golden Knights then attempted to convert on a power play opportunity created by a Harvard hooking penalty. Clarkson went six-on-four, with Howe leaving the goal, trying to make up the two-point deficit.
The Crimson maintained its top-ranked penalty kill, stopping the Golden Knights from finding the back of the net on any of its five power-play attempts. Parker then stepped in, scoring again with a short-handed goal off an assist from Dempsey. It was Parker’s eleventh goal of the season.
“They’re stepping up, and they’re playing well,” Stone said of the team’s freshmen. “Their work ethic is what’s most important, and they’re doing a great job with that.”
Clarkson converted on one final attempt to close the scoring with a goal from Vanessa Gagnon in the final 30 seconds of play.
Maschmeyer, who was named Ivy League Rookie of the Year, moved to 3-0 in her playoff career with the win. The freshman’s shutout streak lasted for almost three entire games, but fell when the Golden Knights scored in the third frame.
No one on the Harvard squad has ever been to the ECAC championship game, having dropped last year’s semifinals contest to St. Lawrence.
“Every year [the semifinals] have been really close for us, and we come up short,” Dempsey said. “It’s been a real heartbreaker.”
The Crimson was able to break the cycle of remaining semifinalists with the win, and the impressive playoff performances helped secure an NCAA tournament bid.
“It’s amazing, since the beginning I’ve said that I have a tremendous amount of faith and confidence in this team and how hard we work and how hard we prepare,” Dempsey said. “It’s really great to see it payoff.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite a late-season injury that left coaches wondering if she’d be able to compete at all, Rebecca Nadler defied the odds as Harvard’s sole competitor at the NCAA Skiing Championships at the Middlebury Snowbowl.
“I’m extremely proud of the effort that she put forward,” Crimson coach Tim Mitchell said. “It would be very easy to sell yourself short and cash it in and not give it everything you have.”
The junior, who was last year’s champion in the giant slalom, turned in an 18th-place finish in the event on Wednesday and finished 23rd in the slalom on Friday.
“I was really glad that I was able to be there,” Nadler said. “I gave it my all.”
Nadler finished the giant slalom course with a total time of 2:08.86 over her two runs, just under five seconds slower than the overall winner, Kristine Haugen of Denver. Haugen, a freshman who has seen action on the international stage on the Norwegian national team, swept the women’s alpine events, also winning the slalom race
Nadler’s first run of 1:04.93 placed her in 17th. Her second run of 1:03.93 set her back on spot but was not enough to catch the field.
Changing, tough conditions played a role in shuffling the final places of the skiers.
“The snow honestly was a little unpredictable this weekend,” Mitchell said. “It would be a little choppy in places, but then it would be soft and then you’d hit a hard spot. People were getting bounced around a lot.”
Two days later, Nadler returned to the slopes to compete in the slalom. Again, despite improvement between the first and second run—from 51.45 to 50.34—Nadler was unable to move up and finished in 23rd place overall.
Nadler has been a key competitor for the Crimson all season, with several top ten and podium finishes this winter.
“The week leading up to it wasn’t exactly what I was hoping for,” Nadler said. “I was injured and didn’t feel as prepared as I could have been but I went and tried my best so I’m really happy with the effort I put into it. I know the results will come, hopefully a little better next year.”

While Flyby's annual house rankings settle the best in housing, d-halls, spirit, and overall quality, there's always one other unspoken category: the housing day video.
And here's what we've got so far:
Mather does its own version of the recent James Bond film in "Matherfall."
Kirkland House Master Tom Conley remakes Brad Pitt's too-deep Chanel Nº5 commercial.
Eliot repurposes Macklemore and Ryan Lewis' "Thrift Shop."
Awkwardly, Cabot does too... a week later.
Lowell remakes Lil' Jon's classic club hit in "Get Lowell." ("To the courtyard, to the bells!").
Pfoho does the Harlem Shake.
Winthrop spoofs the Game of Thrones teaser for their upcoming parody, "Game of Throp."
Quincy prepares their own "Epiq Meal Time."
Adams rides the "Les Miserables" bandwagon with "Do You Hear The Freshmen Sing?" and pulls a Kanye with "Gold Digger."
Dunster showcases its mascot the moose in a video based on the song "Sail" by AWOLNATION.
It looks like a lot of the standards—Thrift Shop, Harlem Shake—are being covered, but we at Flyby give props to Lowell and Adams for some killer throwbacks. We predict goats screaming like humans may be on the horizon for those houses that have yet to release videos. Let's just hope "Gangnam Style" is over.

Every day between now and Housing Day, Flyby will release two new House rankings. The top two Houses will be revealed on Wednesday, March 13. Check back daily for updates!
Built in 1914 as freshman dormitories, Standish and Gore Halls were later united to form Winthrop House. In the years since its inception, Winthrop has certainly accumulated its fair share of famous alums, from J. Robert Oppenheimer '26 to Barnett "Barney" Frank '61-'62, and plenty of Kennedys to boot. Situated less than five minutes from the Yard and directly facing the Charles River, Winthrop is one of the best-located Houses, and residents are pretty much guaranteed an incredible view from their bedrooms at least one year of their three-year stay. Though the rooms themselves may not be the best, Winthrop's architecture is, at the very least, nice to look at from the outside.
House Spirit: Winthrop's IM domination in recent years suggests a pretty tightly knit House community. The Lions have won the Straus Cup for the past five years running, and are going for their sixth. And they're not kidding around, as evidenced by the recent creation of a Winthrop IMs Twitter account to keep people up to date on upcoming competitions and past results. For the less athletically inclined, Winthrop's House spirit isn't the strongest on campus, but the HoCo always encourages residents to come along to their weekly meetings in the JCR. Winthrop's annual spring carnival, "Thropstock," brings Winthrop students together with blow-up rides, a picnic, and live music to enjoy.
Housing Quality: Winthrop has a notoriously bad reputation for its housing, which, for sophomore and even junior suites, is well deserved. Not only does Winthrop lack n+1 housing, the bedrooms in n suites tend to be on the smaller side, forcing many students to relive the dreaded bunk bed days of freshman year. Some residents also complain about thin walls, but hey, you'll definitely know your neighbors well by the end of the year… and maybe someone's boyfriend or girlfriend, too. Once you finally reach the hallowed days of the senior suite, Winthrop's housing really isn't so bad, and they have some pretty great rooms that boast balconies with river views.
Dining Hall: Though the words "dark and dungeon-like" have been thrown around to describe Winthrop's dining hall, we tend to think of the Slytherin-like dark walls and monochrome floors as part of the House's charm. Winthrop's dining hall is one of the quieter culinary locales on the river, which means you're more likely to bump into and be able to socialize with other Winthropians, and won't have to scream to have a conversation with your friends over dinner. While some complain that the servery is laid out counter-intuitively, everyone raves about Winthrop's friendly HUDS staff.
Facilities: Winthrop boasts a beautiful library that is home to some very valuable art. When residents want to take a break from studying to relax, the courtyards have a tire swing, a hammock, and outdoor seating that make spending sunny days at the House a pleasure. Though there aren't a ton of common spaces indoors for when the weather gets colder, students can take advantage of both the Junior Common Room and the Senior Common Room, both of which fit in with Winthrop's classically-Harvard vibe.
House Masters: House Masters Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. and Stephanie Robinson, though not quite as hands-on as other House's masters, are approachable and relate well to college students. Residents say they don't spend much time in the dining hall themselves, but their adorable sons Trey and Chase can often be seen running around during meal times. And Masters' Desserts, which were previously catered by now former-Masters' Aide and Cordon Bleu-trained chef, Paulo Cesar Guede, have a reputation for being delicious.
Extra: Winthrop boasts some pretty unique and exciting events, from an annual game of assassins to the brand new Perini-Woods Memorial Senior Common Room Series, which allows students to listen to talks from notable guests. (Last year's inaugural Perini-Woods address came from Joseph P. Kennedy III.) Residents who live in F-entryway get to spend Presidents' Day evening having a celebration in JFK's old suite, which for the rest of the year is lent to some of Harvard's most distinguished guests. Kennedys aside, Winthrop offers some great class-specific events, including Mini Golf in Gore Courtyard for juniors and wine tastings, a masquerade ball, and Casino Night for seniors.
Our rankings so far:
6. Winthrop
7. Lowell
8. Pforzheimer
9. Mather
10. Leverett
11. Dunster
12. Currier

This post has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 12, 2013
An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that Masters' Desserts in Winthrop are catered by Masters' Aide Paulo Cesar Guede. In fact, Guede no longer works in Winthrop.

Every day between now and Housing Day, Flyby will release two new House rankings. The top two Houses will be revealed on Wednesday, March 13. Check back daily for updates!
The phrase, "I can see the SOCH from my House!" is not generally considered a good thing among Harvard undergraduates.
 
Throughout the (distinguished) history of Flyby House Rankings, Cabot House has been nowhere near the top five. In fact, the House has typically ranked in the bottom two. So what's changed? Not much, as it turns out. After our careful research, it comes down to this—Cabot has simply been underrated. Yes, it's in the Quad. But Cabot's large singles, abundant facilities, beloved House Masters, and overall pleasant atmosphere make it one of the more appealing Houses on campus.
 
House Spirit: Everyone in Cabot loves Cabot. Described as "homey" and "community driven," life in Cabot is friendly and fun. Every Sunday, the House runs "Cabot Sharing" in the dining hall, where students and tutors alike can pick up the open microphone to share anything important to them—be it their research, an emotional story, or even a joke. On the weekends, one can always find a friend in the dining hall during the day and a raging party at night.
 
Housing Quality: Although (and probably because) it is far from the Yard and the Square, Cabot's rooms are spacious and comfortable. Most sophomores have singles, and large common rooms looking out over the Quad are the norm. Four of the six buildings are connected to each other and the dining hall by underground tunnels, meaning that most of Cabot residents don't have to step outside to get Sunday brunch. Being in the Quad has its perks as well—Cabot residents never have to worry about neighborhood noise (although noise can sometimes carry from room to room).
 
Dining Hall: Cabot dining hall is small but pleasant. Looking out over the Quad, it functions a central hub at all hours of the day and night. The dining hall is very modern—it lacks the "old Harvard" feel prevalent in the rest of the House—and sometimes overcrowded due to its size, but students love the friendly dining hall staff and the cozy atmosphere.
 
Facilities: Cabot seems to have everything. From the newly renovated gym to the theater to the abundance of pianos (the most, we think, of any House), it is easy to enjoy Cabot's benefits. Cabot is also home to Quad Bikes and Cabot Café, where students can get a snack until 1 a.m. on weeknights.
 
House Masters: Rakesh and Stephanie Khurana are the catalysts for Cabot's strong House life. They can be found eating in the dining hall regularly, and they frequently lend their support to student-driven projects such as the creation of the roughly 600-square-foot Cabot Art Space (due to open this spring). Students describe them as one of the best parts of Cabot House.
 
Extras: Cabot's mascot is a fish, and they made a t-shirt a few years ago that said, "The river is polluted—all the fish have moved out." The main drawback is distance, but you won’t hear complaints—people love it here.
Our rankings so far:
5. Cabot
6. Winthrop
7. Lowell
8. Pforzheimer
9. Mather
10. Leverett
11. Dunster
12. Currier
