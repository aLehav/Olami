After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Visualize indie rock for a moment. Whether your exposure to the genre consists of infrequently visiting Spotify’s Discover Weekly playlists or of obsessively refreshing Pitchfork and subsequently denying that you take stock in their reviews, you likely thought of a band composed of offbeat members whose haircuts and outfits would only be publicly flaunted by coffee shop aesthetes and angst-ridden teenagers. Amidst the band’s many idiosyncrasies lies one common trait: whiteness.
Mitski, a Japanese-American singer-songwriter from Brooklyn, defies indie rock’s long-standing tradition of whiteness. Her previous albums—“Lush,” “Retired from Sad, New Career in Business,” and especially “Bury Me At Makeout Creek”—received extensive praise from the indie blogosphere for their resonant first-person meditations on heartbreak and maturation in a society wounded by gender power imbalances. The lead single “Your Best American Girl” off of her forthcoming LP, “Puberty 2,” builds on the thematic arc of her discography by telling a highly specific narrative about the ambivalence of being in a relationship that entails renouncing her authenticity and her rootedness in Japanese culture. The result is glorious: “Your Best American Girl” is one of the most awe-inspiring, achingly sincere singles to come out this year.
The song begins with a pairing of dream-pop synths and acoustic guitar that echoes R&B artist Miguel’s sensual “Arch & Point”: However, the lyrics here suggest a longing for the natural, untroubled intimacy that Miguel sexualizes. Mitski sings with hushed vocals: “If I could, I’d be a little spoon / And kiss your fingers forever more / But big spoon, you have so much to do / And I have nothing ahead of me.” Mitski is aware of the disconnect between her and her partner, yet cannot help but yearn for an idealized all-American love. This is what makes “Your Best American Girl” so potent—rather than aggressively decrying an intransigent culture, it expresses a human vulnerability to its charm. The chorus, anchored by perhaps the most rousing use of guitar feedback since Courtney Barnett’s “Pedestrian at Best,” reflects Mitski’s own transition from cultural embarrassment to acceptance. The first time she sings the chorus she seems uncertain: “Your mother wouldn’t approve of how my mother raised me / But I do, I think I do.” The second time the chorus comes around, Mitski is decisive: “Your mother wouldn’t approve of how my mother raised me / But I do, I finally do.” “Your Best American Girl” emphatically rejects the idea that one must cede authenticity for love, and its widespread appeal as a racial narrative in a predominantly white genre marks Mitski as one of the most exciting storytellers in indie rock.
“Puberty 2” is out on June 17 via Dead Oceans.

After capturing the hearts of indie-pop enthusiasts back in 2013 with their eponymous debut album, The 1975 have released their highly anticipated follow-up. An initial glance at the album art alone in “I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware of It” hints at a slight stylistic shift in the band’s image. The white, clean, contemporary cover, in contrast to the black, vintage cover of their first album, suggests the 1975 are electing to maintain their signature minimalist visual aesthetic, but with an obvious attempt at some sort of artistic expansion. The change is intriguing and leads fans to think there might be a significant sonic twist to go along with it. However, though “I Like It When You Sleep…” features brief, exhilarating flashes of experimentation that showcase a new and interesting dimension of the band, the album lacks an overall sense of direction and ultimately suffers due to its underwhelming predictability.
Certain portions of the album show The 1975 at the best they’ve ever been: The same combination of groovy synth-pop and intrepid, intelligent lyrics that we saw in their debut album here evolves to become more sharp, lucid, and intense. “Love Me”—the album’s first and best track—is a blast of energy that finds The 1975 basking in creative euphoria, marrying sonic themes from the ’80s with a cheeky modern twist. The track is driven by arrestingly brilliant lyrics that are equal amounts playful and astute. Notably, lead vocalist Matty Healy at one point plays with elements of rhythm and consonance to deliver the line “caught up in fashion / Karcrashian panache / a bag of bash for passion,” marking a new level of inventiveness for the band. Moreover,  “Somebody Else,” a gem likely easily overlooked due to its soft, unassuming character, highlights the band’s budding versatility and acts as a break from cheerful pop to delve into something more muted and understated. Here we find frontman Healy in complete command, artfully subduing his voice to tap into a melt-worthy kind of tenderness, to encapsulate the heartbreak that comes with seeing a lover “intertwining [their] soul with somebody else.” But in the end, it’s frustrating and unfortunate that no matter how strong these individual tracks are or how indicative they are of musical flair and maturation, they ultimately disintegrate under the album’s lack of focus and cohesion.
Apart from a few exceptional songs, the rest of the album’s offerings are largely either boring or bewildering. Even disregarding its unusually extensive length of 17 tracks that span nearly 75 minutes, the album is often grueling to get through because of how uninspiring and unsuprising the rest of its content is. The majority of the album has the same musical style as tracks like “The Ballad of Me and My Brain” and “She’s American”—songs that aren’t necessarily unpleasant to listen to but lack conviction and sound too much like more lackluster versions of songs from the band’s previous album. Here, The 1975 does itself a disservice by resting on safety rather than engaging in more creative risk-taking; the result finds the band at a standstill, unwilling to take bigger steps forward despite already having demonstrated the creativity and artistic prowess to do so and succeed. Even their occasional stabs at creativity only serve to accentuate the distracting, disorderly nature of the album—an outstanding piece if only for its utter incongruity, “If I Believe You,” creates such a glaring disconnect that it’s hard to believe that the track is even part of the album at all. Though its lyrics are amply substantive, the track as a whole is essentially sluggish, strange, and soporific. Other tracks, such as “This Must Be My Dream” and “Paris,” are too reliant on elements from prior works to possess their own unique identities. An unfortunately significant portion of the album similarly finds The 1975 creatively flat and as a result, translates as wastefully mediocre.
The electrifying and poignant moments of “I Like It When You Sleep…” powerfully attest to The 1975’s capacity to reach new creative heights and to continue making stylish, dynamic art; still, an underlying inclination towards dependence on previous sound renders their sophomore album fundamentally flawed and expressive of shaky maturation at best. With the originality and talent the band has already proven to have, it’s painful to know they could have created something more compelling and exciting—but ultimately didn’t.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Friday, the committee tasked with considering the future of Harvard Law School’s seal, which some have criticized for its connection to the  slaveholding Royall family, recommended that the school change its emblem. While we disagree with the substance of this decision, we respect the process by which HLS reached it.
As the committee's report makes clear, this debate is far more nuanced than a simple case of right versus wrong or racial justice versus injustice. The committee explained that faculty, staff, students, and alumni of diverse races, genders, and ages fell on both sides of the issue. Indeed, one of America’s foremost scholars on slavery’s history dissented from the committee’s recommendations.
As we have previously opined, the Law School’s seal should have been used as an opportunity to reframe how we view Harvard’s historical associations with slavery, not as a means of erasing them. This would have served to remind the Harvard community about our collective responsibility to pursue racial justice each time we set eyes upon the controversial seal.
Such a rededication of the crest would build on the decades of progress that the seal has also come to represent. The committee report poignantly notes that many black HLS alumni see the seal as a marker of progress and a token to their efforts to help diversify the school. Indeed, because the connection between the crest and Isaac Royall was not publicly known until 2000, the seal stood for academic achievement and social progress for nearly 70 years. In this spirit, Law School Professor Annette Gordon-Reed suggested that the choice to change the seal is the “conservative” one.
However, in light of the difficulty of this debate, with emotional distress on one side and the potential erasure of history on the other, it is gratifying that the Law School has approached this conversation in a forthright way.
The careful process undertaken by the Law School is a stark contrast to the one through which House Masters became Faculty Deans last month. The College was opaque, closed, and incommunicative in its approach; HLS has been transparent, open, and deeply reflective.
College administrators sought few outside opinions, provided no clear timeline, and even appeared to contradict spokespeople about the progress of discussions. Across campus, HLS solicited the input of all faculty, staff, students, and alumni via a massive email blast that inspired 1,000 responses. They followed this with two open community meetings. Instead of a single Dean ultimately picking a new title, a 12-person committee chosen from the Law School community was assembled. In contrast to the College’s unclear and unsound 600-word email justifying its decision, the Law School's 11-page committee report detailed the history, meaning, and import of the shift recommended. The report laid out both sides of the issue, clearly and thoughtfully explaining the reasoning underlying its recommendations.
While the changing of a school’s emblem perhaps carries more weight than the renaming of a title, the sharp difference between the two processes illustrates how Harvard should deal with sensitive issues like these two going forward. Rarely are there clear cut solutions to such situations. But whatever we decide, we should endeavor to approach the challenges of our past with nuance and depth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In life, certain defining, almost metaphysical events divide history into before and after. When I was a high schooler, I had such a moment that came to define my life for two years: I realized I was unhappy and needed a change. I came to chafe at the sprawling and oppressive suburbia of Raleigh, North Carolina, and yearned to trade in the banal hallways of the public high school I attended for something much loftier; I decided I wanted to go to Harvard, and would dedicate the remainder of my high school career to reaching this goal.
This goal, however, required a considerable sacrifice and psychological burden on my behalf. I invested all my energy in maintaining a spotless academic record and preparing myself to score high on standardized tests; I needed to make myself as palatable as possible. The inexhaustible work ethic I developed also served as a double-pronged anesthesia:  I dedicated so much energy to my aspiration that I became numb to the world surrounding me, and, in turn, constantly reassured myself that the eventual letter I would receive from Harvard would atone for all that I was missing out on in high school.
It was this simple yet powerful logic that governed my life for two years. In my eyes, only admission and thereafter matriculation at Harvard could validate my purgatorial high school experience. The admission rate was miserably low, so the reward would be proportionately great, I reasoned to myself.  In the same vein, I had seen valedictorians in classes before mine apply to no avail, and yearned to be the one who seemingly violated the laws of statistics by receiving the golden ticket to Harvard.
On the surface, it may seem that it was merely petty megalomania that drove my efforts in high school. This interpretation, however, disregards the deeper psychological dynamics that underlay my determination. In the words of David Foster Wallace in his famous “This is Water” speech, “there is actually no such thing as atheism,” since “everybody worships.” This supposition is not about religion so much as the way in which we humans approach our lives; we have a constant tendency to cast our marbles with some sort of higher entity that will enable us to construct some meaning out of our mundane lives, a higher entity that serves as an existential lens whose diffraction dictates our perceptions and day to day experiences.
I chose, perhaps not even consciously, the desire to go to Harvard as my existential lens. This lens, however, served most of all as a shutter. It exempted me from having to make an effort to find friends or to show much regard for my parents, since I had convinced myself that in two years’ time I would be shipping up to Cambridge. It enabled me to spurn the world surrounding me for my hypothetical conception of myself as a Harvard undergraduate.
My far-off aspirations, however, were more than detrimental to my appreciation of the world that surrounded me; they were a delusion. Contrary to my expectations, the stardust in Harvard’s rarefied halls fades after a few months. I do not wake up each morning and pinch myself in order to make sure I am living a Harvard reality rather than a Harvard dream. Granted, I now have 20/20 hindsight, but it was only my admission to and matriculation at Harvard that removed my shutters and allowed me to see past the myopic notion that attending the right college could gratify me on a deep, existential level as nothing ever had before.
Despite the subjectivity of the narrative I present, I think that my story is not uncommon, especially in an age of unprecedented deflation in college admission rates and competition among high schoolers. These factors make it all too tempting for high schoolers to choose admission to an elite college as their existential lens, a choice that both deludes and numbs them.
All of this is not to deny Harvard’s many merits as an elite college. It is truly a place steeped in bright undergraduates and world-class scholars. The benefits of attending Harvard, however, do not go beyond that scope. It is a just school, admittedly a very good one. Nevertheless, it is not and never will be what I hoped it would be for two years: a true raison d’être.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like a floundering wedding toast, Donald Trump’s presidential candidacy was deeply funny before it became deeply troubling. Much effort has been expended of late in understanding Trumpism—both what it means and what it portends. Truth being much stranger and crueler than fiction, the politicos have less substance to offer nowadays than the comedians and the satirists. It’s a bit like being forced to live through a comedic sketch, like a Futurama gag that went on many months too long.
Thinking about Trump in dystopic terms, as I tend to do, leads me to seek sanctuary in literature. A little before Huey Long’s political ambitions were cut short by a bullet, Sinclair Lewis penned his great political satire “It Can’t Happen Here.” Of course, the impossible does happen—the authoritarian Buzz Windrip wins the presidential election and marches America steadily along the road to totalitarianism. Perhaps also instructive in the matter is Phillip Roth’s more recent “The Plot Against America,” in which the fascist Charles Lindbergh rides a wave of anti-Semitic, populist support to the White House.
Much like these fictional despots, Trump is said to be a populist, yet everyone—aside from his supporters—seems to hate that he leads the Republican primary field. The Republican Party is scrambling to avoid further embarrassment, while the depleted stock of candidates speaks conspiratorially of brokered conventions.
Sun Tzu argued that to defeat your enemies, you must first know them. And so we must. First, the man: equal parts brash, brogue, and braggart. Then, the platform, as inaccurate an appellation as that may be: It is vapidity incarnated, where vague appeals to the superlative (constructions like “greatest,” “best,” and “all time”) masquerade as policy substance. It is also, fundamentally, an expression of majoritarian victimhood, an elaborate whine made amidst all this talk of greatness, lost or reclaimed. Instead of political incorrectness, as his advocates prefer to christen it, Trump seeks to parcel the blame for white disaffectedness on any scapegoat in sight: Muslims, Mexicans, Chinese, and anyone else.
The man’s a chameleon, a charlatan, a vindictive vulgarian. He says nothing, is bound to nothing—he is the least factual, substantive, and civil candidate that I’ve seen. And yet he is the likely Republican nominee, and perhaps, with the timely implosion of Hillary Clinton’s campaign, the next president.
How, oh how, could this happen?
This blame game is widely played: Trump is, after all, the hair-do that launched a thousand think pieces. Maybe it was Mitt Romney’s fault for seeking Trump’s endorsement in the last election? Or perhaps “Obama-era trends in liberal politics?” Or is it the untapped reservoir of “authoritarian” Americans, a modish new theory put out by one political scientist? (I’m skeptical that the assessment of “authoritarianism”—based on questions about child-rearing strategies—used in these studies actually captures something meaningful about voters.) One thing is for sure though: He’s not just a summer fling, as some within the commentariat had claimed.
I have another theory, one that is radical only because it gets no mention among polite society.
It’s the Republicans, stupid.
I happen to be of the opinion that the horridness of a political party’s elected standard-bearer actually says something about that party—even if their elites are of a different mind. That something has stunk about the Republican Party has been no secret to anyone, even the party’s leaders. They even commissioned an autopsy that predicted much of these misfortunes not long after they so splendidly squandered their presidential chances in 2012.
In the past, whenever someone pointed to the xenophobes, barely concealed racists, and conspiracy theorists congealing at the base of the Republican Party, they were labeled impolite and disrespectful. Bipartisanship has long been lionized, but its core assumption is that both parties have reasonable ideas that emerge from respectful differences of opinion.
Without a dramatic reconstitution of the Republican Party, by which I mean the disavowal and expulsion of the crazies, that idea can no longer hold. I pity the reasonable Republicans—and they do exist—who must publicly show their faces amid this debacle. Let’s hope we can make them respectable again.

Graduates, ready the popcorn: renowned filmmaker Steven Spielberg will speak at Harvard’s 365th Commencement on May 26, the University announced Thursday.
Cameras will be rolling when Spielberg, a two-time Oscar winner for Best Director, addresses graduates and their families during the Afternoon Exercises of Commencement, which will take place in Harvard Yard’s Tercentenary Theatre. 

Spielberg’s name is synonymous with American cinema. He has worked on a host of award-winning and box office hits, including Jaws, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, and Saving Private Ryan. His latest film, a cold war spy drama called Bridge of Spies, came out in the fall and was nominated for several Oscars.
“Through his art, Mr. Spielberg has challenged us to dream and to see the world anew, and I am very much looking forward to welcoming him back to Harvard and to honoring him during our 365th Commencement exercises,” University President Drew G. Faust said in a press release Thursday.
Spielberg spoke at Harvard in 2014, when he discussed his sources of inspiration and the future of cinema with humanities professor Homi K. Bhabha; in 2013, he was awarded the W.E.B. Du Bois medal for his contributions to African and African American culture. Spielberg was named the Hasty Pudding Man of the Year in 1983, one accolade among a litany.
Spielberg’s career in film has spanned from the summer blockbuster to the serious period drama. Many of his early works, like E.T. the Extra-terrestrial and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, became ingrained in popular culture and achieved immense financial success. His later movies, including Schindler’s List and Lincoln, earned widespread critical acclaim and engaged with difficult historical moments.
“An extraordinary storyteller, he has given voice to the silenced and brought history to life,” Faust said.
Spielberg’s selection is a departure from a recent set of politically-inclined Harvard Commencement speakers. Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick spoke at the Afternoon Exercises in 2015, and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg addressed graduates in 2014.

During the transition to the revamped Gen Ed program, students will choose to fulfill requirements under either the new or the old system, according to Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Michael P. Burke.
“If you’re straddling the two Gen Eds, the Gen Ed program is going to try to provide you with enough flexibility to satisfy the spirit of the new one if possible,” Burke said. “The Registrar’s office and the Gen Ed program will have to know which program you’re pursuing—the existing one or the one that has not been launched.”
The new program, approved last Tuesday by an FAS vote and slated for a possible 2018 launch, will feature four new Gen Ed categories, down from the current eight, along with three broad distribution requirements and a quantitative course.
Up until their senior years, students experiencing the transition can fulfill their requirements using either the old or the new categories, similar to how students could opt in or out of Gen Ed’s first iteration when it replaced the Core, Burke said.
The switch to the new system brings a host of administrative and technical difficulties that must be addressed before the revamped Gen Ed can launch, Burke added. In order for the system to count courses toward the new Gen Ed requirements, Burke and others will have to re-tag courses in the Student Information System to reflect the new categories.
“When we create a course in the Student Information System, that course has certain attributes attached to it. One of those attributes is that it meets General Education requirements,” Burke said. “If the categories are changing, we have to change the courses that are attributed for that requirement.”
Before that can happen, the Gen Ed program will have to determine what courses fall under each of the four new categories, and which courses can count toward the divisional distribution requirements. On Wednesday, chair of the Gen Ed standing committee Edward J. Hall said that current and future Gen Ed courses will have to undergo a “careful re-assessment process” before they can join the new program.
Once Gen Ed administrators have determined what courses will count toward each new requirement, SIS staff must input that data into the system, a process that could take several weeks, Burke said.
“There’s some time and effort required, but it’s not a very complex process,” Burke said, noting that groups of courses could be tagged en masse.
More time-consuming will be testing the new configuration to ensure that it works for real students, Burke said.
“Most of the time will be spent on testing and data validation,” Burke said. “To make sure it’s right, it could be up to six months.”
Burke said that despite the hard work ahead, those involved with the rollout of the new program are excited about its prospects.
“It’s going to be exciting to work through this to help create a new era of this program,” Burke said.

As undergraduates prepare to enjoy spring break with abandon, Harvard is cautioning traveling students in the wake of a mumps outbreak.
The total number of confirmed mumps cases has risen from six to nine within the past week, and mumps patients now live quarantined in “the Houses and Harvard-owned properties,” according to College Spokesperson Rachael Dane. Henry M. N. Brooks ’19, who has mumps, said he was quarantined for the past few days in the Harvard Inn, and that meals were brought to him while he was in isolation.
Now, with students set to depart for spring break this weekend, Harvard University Health Services Director Paul J. Barreira urged caution in order to minimize others’ exposure to mumps.
“With spring recess only a few days away, I know many of you will be leaving the Cambridge area, and I write to remind you that it is even more important to be vigilant in taking precautions to prevent the spread of mumps if you are planning to travel,” Barreira wrote in an email to undergraduates Wednesday evening. “Doing this is crucial to minimizing the exposure of others to the virus.”
On March 1, Barreira announced an official University-wide mumps outbreak. One day later, he said six students had confirmed cases of the mumps. In an email similar to two previous he sent previously, Barreira wrote Wednesday morning that the nine mumps patients are living in isolation, and that those showing symptoms should refrain from traveling and “public activities.”
He also provided a bulleted list of precautionary measures to prevent the disease’s spread, such as refraining from sharing objects like lipstick, water bottles, and cigarettes.
Voicing similar sentiments, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana sent a College-wide email Thursday afternoon reminding students to consider physical health as the break soon approaches.
In the meantime, HUHS has said it is working with the Cambridge Public Health Department and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to determine the scope of the exposure.

As colorful banners emblazoned with House shields and upperclassmen dressed in themed attire occupied the Yard on Housing Day, there was a palpable tension inside freshmen dorms. Quickly enough, though, shrieks of happiness—and some audible sighs—shattered the tension as freshmen began to learn their new housing assignments.
In recent decades, Housing Day has grown into a holiday for students at the College. Students don housing gear, sing House-related chats, and host a number of events intended to welcome freshmen to their new homes.
For many, the feeling of merriment continued to dominate Housing Day this year.
“We were just talking about how we wish Harvard was like this every day,” Alana J. Davitt ’19 said. “There’s music, people are happy, the weather is nice, and it’s the pinnacle of school spirit and pride.”
When considering House options, freshmen said they hoped to have single bedrooms.
“I’m pretty stoked about it, I’ll be living the single life for the next three years,” said Grace M. Chao ’19, who received a housing assignment in Mather. “I’m also an athlete so Mather is convenient at least for the field,” she added.
Others praised the Quad Houses for their expansive green spaces and amenities, in addition to the ready availability of singles.
“I didn’t have a particular House I wanted, but I’m excited to get Cabot and I know the Quad has really nice housing, yard space, and large singles, so I’m excited,” Abigail N. Burke ’19 said.
Future Lowell House residents, such as Salvatore R. DeFrancesco ’19, expressed concern with Lowell’s upcoming renovations, which will last two years, but were nonetheless excited to join the House.
Freshmen said they were also appreciative of the upperclassmen who helped organize House-related events and dormstorm freshmen rooms, a practice in which upperclassmen “storm,” en masse, freshmen dorm rooms to deliver housing assignment letters.
“You feel really welcomed by your Houses storming to your room and throughout all the other events during the day,” Meredith A. Jones ’19 said. “You can tell they’re really making an effort to reach out to freshmen and make them feel welcome to the community.”
Mather House Committee co-chair Trevor A. Mullin '17 said House staff aim to “give rising sophomores a crash-course on the supporting and exciting social life” at Mather.
Still, Housing Day was not as exhilarating and positive for some students. At least one blocking group waited in their rooms and did not receive a Housing assignment letter.
“Like all the other blocking groups at Harvard, we waited in our designated room at 8:30, eagerly anticipating the knock on the door,” Jacob N. Russell ’19, one of the members of the blocking group, wrote in an emailed statement. “Somehow our group was either forgotten, or the letter was lost.  We are just very disappointed that we did not get to truly experience housing day.”
After visiting administrators in University Hall, the group received their eventual housing assignment: Pforzheimer House.

In the summer of 2014, when Harvard announced a new set of Title IX policies and procedures, it took a now-familiar step: centralizing resources and making standards uniform across the University’s 12 schools.
The new Title IX framework included an overhauled definition of sexual harassment governing each Harvard school and created a single investigative office to handle complaints from across the University. Mia Karvonides, the first University-wide Title IX Officer, began to oversee and enforce the new policy. The Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response hired a new counselor to focus on students at Harvard’s graduate and professional schools. 
A task force dedicated to studying sexual assault prevention at Harvard took a similar tack, calling for the creation of a new position focusing on sexual assault prevention in the Provost’s office. Administrators, professors, and students from across Harvard worked on the task force for almost two years to formulate the final report, drawing on a University-wide sexual misconduct survey administered last year.
“It is hard to imagine how such a long-term focus can occur without having a dedicated person responsible for ensuring that the University remains focused on the inevitably evolving requirements of an effective prevention program at a complex institution,” the task force wrote in a final report released Tuesday.
As Harvard grapples with the pernicious issue of sexual assault on campus, its efforts have echoed a greater institutional shift in recent decades. Instead of the so-called “Every Tub on Its Own Bottom” model, where every individual school operates mostly autonomously, Harvard has increasingly embraced a “One University” structure, locating resources in and crafting policies from its central administration.
With the creation of the new position in the Provost’s office, Harvard plans to institutionalize the task force’s University-wide work. The new administrator will orchestrate the work of the Title IX coordinators, the Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, and other offices; measure the effectiveness of prevention programs; and develop new educational materials for students and faculty. Individual schools will implement many of the task force’s recommendations. 
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said his office had accepted the recommendation and is defining the precise duties of the new administrator.
“We will also determine the qualifications candidates will need to be successful in the new role,” Garber wrote in an email. “Because this is a completely new position, it will be important to work out these details before we actually start the hiring process.”
Peter F. Lake ’81, a higher education expert at Stetson University College of Law, said he supports the new position, arguing that it will help Harvard better implement sexual assault prevention programs.
“A lot of times these people do work hand in hand with the Title IX Coordinator,” Lake said. “But there's just so much work to do and detail to follow through that you almost need a planner or executing individual that can help to manage the flow of all the work.”
But Harvey A. Silverglate ’67, a local attorney who advises students during Harvard’s disciplinary processes, contended that the new position represents another example of needless growth within Harvard’s administration. He said that continually creating administrative positions hurts Harvard more than it helps.
“It’s a voracious beast,” Silvergate said of Harvard’s administration. “It’s a dragon that continually needs to feed itself to breathe fire.”
The  centralization of Harvard’s sexual harassment policy has also met resistance within the University, most notably from the Law School. After Harvard’s Title IX office instituted its University-wide standards, professors at the Law School lambasted the policy in the press and ultimately opted out of the system altogether, developing an independent set of investigation procedures for its students.
Beyond creating the new administrative position, the task force’s report also called for every Harvard student to receive annual sexual assault prevention training and asked the College to develop “a plan to address the problems presented by Final Clubs.” Faust, a proponent of a collaborative “One Harvard” model, said in a statement Tuesday she would accept the task force’s recommendations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The City of Boston announced four goals to guide the metropolis’ growth over the next few decades as part of Imagine Boston 2030—the first citywide plan in half a century—in a report published online last Thursday.
City officials determined the four goals—improving quality of life in Boston neighborhoods, fostering “inclusive” economic growth, adapting to challenges posed by climate change, and investing in new infrastructure—with feedback from Boston residents. Bostonians had previously participated in a citywide survey, launched last October and concluded this winter, asking how their lives should improve by 2030.
"This input is an important first step in the planning process because it shapes the conversation about how Boston can leverage its unprecedented growth to create an even better city," Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh said in a press release. "Our overarching goal is to make sure everyone who lives, works and plays in Boston benefits from this growth, while setting the course for future generations to grow inclusively and have access to opportunity."
Boston’s last attempt at a citywide plan came in 1965 when government officials outlined a 10-year blueprint intended to create the “New Boston,” a city transformed by parks, various urban renewal projects, and expressways. Though some of the 1965 plan’s proposals came to fruition, many did not—a recent Boston Globe article termed the plan “both prophetic and dead wrong.”
Now, Walsh said he hopes to institute a more successful citywide plan. Imagine Boston 2030, a two-year initiative slated for official release in the spring of 2017, aims to tackle issues—like heavy urban density, Bostonians’ unequal access to public transit and education, and a lack of affordable housing—raised by Boston’s recent, unprecedented population growth.
“Boston is a very successful, very dynamic metropolitan area [that] can also be quite fun... consequently, over the past 15 years there’s been a robust increase in demand for the city of Boston,” Economics professor Edward L. Glaeser said of the city’s recent population increase. Between 2011 and 2014 alone, Boston’s population grew by six percent, twice the national rate, according to data published online by the City of Boston.
Though lacking in specifics, last Thursday’s report included a brief discussion of potential next steps. Broadly, the City plans to construct new housing, establish various programs to increase employment, protect existing infrastructure from future damage due to environmental change, upgrade Boston’s transportation systems, and build new parks.
Glaeser expressed enthusiasm for the first of these plans, citing concerns over the affordability of Boston-area homes. According to Glaeser, the recent increase in demand for Boston housing has not been matched by a commensurate rise in supply, leading to a jump in prices.
“The only way to make sure that Boston doesn’t become a town affordable only for the wealthy is to make sure that Boston builds more,” Glaeser said. “What we really need is enough new housing so that anybody can come to Boston and rent an affordable apartment.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of Divest Harvard have shown support and offered protest models for Fossil Free MIT, a student activist group that recently completed a 116-day sit-in to urge the MIT administration to end its investment in the fossil fuel industry.
Over the course of the past few months, members of Fossil Free MIT staged an ongoing sit-in in the hallway outside MIT President L. Rafael Reif’s Office. On March 1, the organization came to an agreement with the MIT administration on climate action moving forward, bringing the sit-in to an end, according to a press release from Fossil Free MIT.
In their efforts to adopt a more assertive approach, the student activists at MIT looked to Divest Harvard on how to frame their most recent demonstration, Fossil Free treasurer Benjamin Scandella said.
“We were inspired by the work that’s been done at Harvard. At the same time we wanted to make sure that we didn’t get completely shut out by administration at MIT,” he said. “We wanted to be careful about stepping into more direct activism in a way that would allow us to keep talking with them.”
Last year, students in Divest Harvard staged a week long blockade of Massachusetts Hall, which houses University President Drew G. Faust's office, in order to urge the University to take out its investments in fossil fuels. They have also previously occupied Mass. Hall.
According to Divest Harvard board member Benjamin Franta, Divest visited the sit-in a few times to offer support, even though MIT administrators did not allow non-MIT students to participate in the demonstration. While Fossil Free and Divest have never officially collaborated, both groups often coordinate with each other and show up to each other’s events in solidarity, Franta said.
Fanta said the tactics of each group normally differ because he believes that MIT’s administration, up until recently, has been more open to working with students than Harvard's.
Faust herself has expressed commitment to climate change research and offers funding for faculty engaging in such research. However, she has repeatedly argued against divestment, saying such a move would politicize Harvard's endowment. Last spring, she offered to meet with members of Divest Harvard on the condition they end their blockade, but the group refused.
Scandella said while the MIT student activists are proud of the progress they made at the school, they are still not completely satisfied with the agreement reached, in part because it  did not stipulate that the university would remove its investments in fossil fuels.
Applied physics professor David Keith, who supports Divest Harvard, said that universities like Harvard and MIT could use their shareholding and connections with fossil fuel companies to push much harder than they currently are to stop lobbying against climate change legislation.
“The power of institutions like MIT and Harvard to set the public discourse is important,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Psychology professor Daniel Gilbert and University professor Gary King criticized a 2015 study claiming that more than half of all psychology studies cannot be replicated, finding that the study itself contains replication flaws.
More than 250 authors contributed to the original “Science” magazine study, which was named by the magazine as one of the top 10 most important scientific breakthroughs of 2015 and garnered significant media attention, King said.
“I do think the original article had such incredibly far reach, having been published in the world’s premier scientific journal, and having leveled a charge against the entire field that really shook everyone up, so I think it really did quite a lot of damage to the reputation of psychology,” Gilbert said.
Gilbert said that the original article had three overarching problems. The authors failed to draw a random sample of psychology studies, they replicated the experiments in the studies that they chose under different conditions than the original experiments, and the data contained statistical errors.
“The most important mistake the authors of the original paper made was that they viewed their work as separate from, and above, the rules of science,” King wrote in an email.
Stephen Pettigrew, a graduate student in the Government Department, was brought into the project by King to work with the data from the original authors. All of this data was available online. Pettigrew, Gilbert, and King were also in communication with the lead author of the article.
“It was a really interesting case of collaboration,” Pettigrew said. “It was the scientific process at work for sure, where everybody’s trying to work toward the truth.”
Since publication, the team has received many responses to their critique, some positive and some negative. According to Pettigrew, the lead author of the original article, Brian A. Nosek, has been retweeting comments on both sides of the debate.
“My general response is that I am delighted that they took the time to explore the data and generate a comment,” Nosek wrote in an email. “The purpose of doing the project openly - sharing the process, materials and data - was so that many people would do exactly this.”
Gilbert said he hopes people will consider both sides of the argument.
“I’m only concerned with people who really carefully read all the material and drew their own conclusions,” Gilbert said.
He said he is confident that any scientist who does indeed read carefully will formulate his same conclusion.
Gilbert emphasized that the critique was not an attack against the original article, but rather part of the process of science.
“The beauty of science is that we keep correcting each other and that helps us move forward.” Gilbert said. “So we’re glad that they published the article, and we’re glad that we were able to publish the critique and engage in a productive conversation with our critics.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 11, 2016, at 1:08 p.m.
Finish reading. Attend lecture. Answer student emails. Coordinate  film screenings. Study Ukrainian. Research for dissertation.
“A little bit of all of that thrown together” is how Ph.D. student Erin M. Hutchinson describes her day-to-day life as a third year doctoral candidate in the History department, and as a teaching fellow in the College.
About three miles away, Ph.D. student Avery A. Davis works as a research assistant in a lab at Harvard Medical School. She is a fourth year in Biological and Biomedical Sciences and she studies copy number variation, a form of variation in the genome.
Though their studies are quite distinct, Hutchinson and Davis are both active members of the Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers, a unionization effort that recently announced it had garnered a majority support among graduates that Harvard employs. The effort, made public last spring, aims to bring Harvard and graduate students employed by the University—including teaching fellows and research assistants—into a collective bargaining arrangement so that graduate students can negotiate on benefits and working conditions.
Harvard administrators have repeatedly warned against the prospect of graduate student unionization, arguing such a move would shift the focus of the University’s relationship with its graduate students from academics to labor. Earlier this month, Harvard jointly submitted an amicus brief to the National Labor Relations Board, calling for the body to continue to define the relationship between private universities and graduate students as strictly academic.
But graduate students from across the University  maintain they should be classified as workers and gain the right to negotiate with Harvard. These students come from a variety of diverse academic backgrounds, but even students from schools as different as the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the Medical School share many of the same concerns, ranging from health benefits and financial stability to teaching position availability.
UNITING ISSUES
Many students have said that the union movement, HGSU-UAW, has brought together graduate students from across Harvard and allowed them to understand the issues impacting students in departments other than their own.
For example, among many graduate students, health insurance is often a major sticking point. Tuition can often cover GSAS students’ health insurance, but some say they would like to see more benefits.
“A lot of our issues like health benefits and dental unite all of us,” Hutchinson said. “If someone in the sciences has a kid, if someone in the humanities has a kid, we both need time off, we both care about issues like that.”
GSAS students do not need to pay a copay for visits within University Health Services, but there is a $35 copay for outside visits. And no Harvard graduate school includes full dental coverage in their health benefits package, a fact that remains concerning to some people.
“I’ve got tons of cavities now. My teeth are in the worst condition they’ve been in for my whole life,” union supporter Byron M. Davies, a Ph.D. student in the Philosophy Department, said. “I imagine a lot of it has to do with the fact that I have to pay so much out of pocket for dental care.”
GSAS administrators have begun talking about the possibility of offering a dental plan, although fully covered dental insurance is not common at many graduate schools, according to GSAS Dean for Student Affairs Garth O. McCavana.
“That’s something we’re taking a hard look at,” GSAS Dean for Administration and Finance Allen Aloise said. “We’re exploring the option, we’re pricing out, collecting data on what sort of options are out there and what the prices would be.”
HGSU-UAW hopes to call for more subsidized housing to graduate students across Harvard, especially given student concern about the rising cost of living in and around Cambridge.
Union supporter Leigh G. Senderowicz, a doctoral candidate at the School of Public Health, had to move to Jamaica Plain, a distant location, and says she still feels financially strained.
“I live at the very last stop of the orange line. It’s not like I’m trying to live somewhere super downtown,” Senderowicz said. “I’m living as far away as I could possibly live and still be connected via the T.”
SCRAMBLING TO TEACH
Many graduate students also face difficulty trying to fulfill paid teaching positions. For graduate students in the social sciences and humanities entering their third year, during which students are typically guaranteed to teach, the semester often starts with a scramble for such positions.
Hutchinson was first assigned to teach a sophomore History tutorial, but later learned the professor would not return to campus.Ultimately, she was assigned to a course that normally would not have had a teaching fellow.
Because of Harvard’s unique course registration process, teaching fellows often do not find out what course they will teach until a few weeks into the semester, because enrollment numbers for classes are not determined until after study card submission.
“The thing that’s a little frustrating is that I didn’t really know until really after study card day if I was officially assigned to that class, or if I was going to have to scramble and find another teaching position,” Hutchinson said.
Union supporter Ronni G. Sadovsky, a J.D. and Ph.D. student studying in the Philosophy department, said that teaching positions for third and fourth year students do not always pan out. As a third year  several years ago, Sadovsky said she was told there were not enough teaching assignments to satisfy demand.
“I sent out CVs all over the place. I interviewed for this Jewish literature course even though I haven’t taken a literature course since I was in high school. I tried to teach modern Hebrew just because I speak it,” Sadovsky said.
Harvard’s shopping period does not only lead to delayed assignment for teaching fellows; it also creates problems with payroll. Aloise said the issue often occurs both because of the chaos of shopping week and also graduate students transitioning into their teaching years and switching between two different University payroll systems.
“The way Harvard manages its preregistration, or lack thereof, is one of the complicating factors around this,” Aloise said. “There is not a defined number of sections associated with every course being offered, therefore it is not possible to assign the correct number of graduate students to sections and laboratories well in advance.”
Each department is responsible for staffing itself and handles teaching appointments internally. With more than 50 departments and divisions using imperfect information, Aloise said, “There are too many points of failure.”
Aloise said he is currently working with the College’s Office of Undergraduate Education to develop a program, which will hopefully be in place by next fall, in which students can invoke their teaching guarantee and be placed on the payroll automatically.
“The act putting them on the payroll won’t have to be married to a specific course,” Aloise said. “That can happen in the background with all the shopping period drama, and then their pay will issue on time and in whole.”
To supplement their teaching positions, some students must obtain jobs outside of the University to pay their bills. Senderowicz often works at external consultancies because of  financial instability.
“If I had the choice I would absolutely not be doing those consultancies. It is a huge time suck. It is completely distracting,” she said.
Last spring, Senderowicz was both a teaching assistant and a full-time student, and also worked a consultancy job.
“It’s really antithetical to the learning process when I’m not focused at all on my main reason for being here, which is to learn how to be an independent researcher and produce my own knowledge, because I’m just constantly having to think about where my next paycheck is coming from and where my next job is going to come from,” Senderowicz said.
Union supporter Kau’i Baumhofer, a student at the School of Public Health, is a teaching assistant for two different graduate school classes.
“My spring break will be grading 50 or 51 final papers,” she said with a laugh. But she was clear in her reasoning for taking on a double position. “It was to pay bills.”
PARITY ACROSS SCHOOLS?
The HGSU-UAW union effort considers all teaching fellows and research assistants to be graduate “workers.” Some of these student "workers" aren't under GSAS, so they  are denied benefits that GSAS students have accrued.
Beginning next fall, the School of Public Health’s five doctor of science  programs will be replaced by the Ph.D. in Population Health Sciences. As such, a new group of students will be brought under the GSAS umbrella.
Doctor of science students currently do not receive some benefits students in the GSAS enjoy, including a newly implemented MBTA discount and increased stipend and leave time for expectant parents.
“It makes you feel bad about yourself,” Senderowicz, the School of Public Health student, said. “It colors your whole experience when you see everyone around you doing the same thing as you’re doing, and getting so much more.”
However, Senderowicz said she believes GSAS students deserve all of the benefits they receive and more, but that she and her fellow School of Public Health peers should also receive similar benefits.
“My ire is not aimed horizontally at other students who have things that I don’t have, but at the university who is ok with that inequity and then still deprives people of the conditions that they need to live dignified lives,” she said.
The presence of the unionization effort has opened some students’ eyes to perceived disparities in benefits across graduate student education.
“If it weren’t for some involvement in the union, I would not have known about certain respects in which graduate students in other departments have things even tougher than we have in our department,” Davies said.
Over on the Longwood campus, Davis said she actually joined the unionization effort because she is aware of this disparity, despite her personal benefits and experience being fairly good.
“I feel like it’s a real responsibility if people have it very good to speak up for people who don’t,” Davis said.
Other students echoed her sentiments. Baumhofer and Davies are graduating soon, so they understand they will not reap the rewards they believe a union would bring.
“That doesn’t matter to me. I’m not involved and I’m not supporting this effort because I’m going to get something out of it,” Baumhofer said.
Davies echoed Baumhofer. “I want to leave making sure Harvard graduate students are in a better, more secure position than when I entered,” Davies said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What a difference a goal makes.
A year ago, Jimmy Vesey lifted a deflected puck over the right pad of Yale goaltender Alex Lyon in New Haven. The double-overtime strike clinched the ECAC quarterfinal series for the Harvard men’s hockey team and set up the Crimson’s conference title in Lake Placid the very next week.
In a Players’ Tribune article last week, Vesey identified the quarterfinal victory as the tipping point in his decision to forgo a pro deal with the Nashville Predators and return to Cambridge for his senior season. The column, an emotional ode to Harvard and college hockey, conveniently coincided with the NHL trade deadline, in which Nashville General Manager David Poile avoided any major acquisitions to preserve an open roster spot for his team’s prized draft pick.
Vesey’s admission might have prompted some particularly passionate (or neurotic) Predators fans to ponder an alternate reality—one in which Vesey never scored that goal. One in which Vesey signed with Nashville last March, slid into the Predators’ top-six forward rotation in April, bridged the difference in those overtime losses to Chicago, and boosted Nashville to a Stanley Cup championship in June.
While the Music City can only dream, the goal’s impact on Vesey’s present team is clear. As Harvard prepares to host Rensselaer in Game 1 of the 2016 edition of the ECAC Hockey quarterfinals later today, Vesey and company are no longer frustrated underachievers. They’re defending champions.
The role change comes with new expectations and opportunities. A series win this weekend would all but assure Harvard a spot in the NCAA regionals, earning the program its first tournament berths in consecutive years since 2006. Meanwhile, a sweep of the next two weekends would place this Crimson squad among Harvard’s best. In the 53-year history of the ECAC tournament, Harvard has yet to win back-to-back postseason titles.
For Vesey in particular, the next two weekends offer an opportunity to cement a special legacy.
Last year, the Charlestown native scored an ECAC tournament-record nine goals over seven games in perhaps the most dominant individual performance of the entire NCAA postseason. This year, Vesey again finds himself in the national player of the year conversation after a consistent regular season punctuated by flashes of brilliance, but the co-captain has yet to string together a stretch of play that quite matches his effort from last March.
Harvard men’s hockey has churned out a long line of all-time great alumni. If I had to rank them, I’d place the national players of the year and Olympic gold medalists—Lane MacDonald ’89, the Fusco Brothers and the Cleary Brothers—firmly in a top tier of greatness. Joe Cavanagh ’71, C.J. Young ’90, Dominic Moore ’03, and Alex Killorn ’12 are among other stars of yesteryear who could factor into a first- or second-tier conversation.
Vesey already ranks among the greats. He currently sits tied for fifth with Dan DeMichele ’71 on the Crimson’s all-time goal list at 77 scores, seven behind Young and 34 behind MacDonald. It’s just a question of what tier. Another title would go a long way, but that will require besting a deep ECAC headed by the nation’s No. 1 team.
The final measure of Harvard’s season—and Vesey’s collegiate career—will be taken sometime over the next four weekends. A single goal might make all the difference.
Let’s take a look at this weekend’s quarterfinal match-ups:
CORNELL AT QUINNIPIAC
In a clash between old-hockey snobs and new-hockey snobs, Cornell will need to double Quinnipiac’s season loss total to get out of Hamden alive. Meanwhile the nation’s top-ranked Bobcats are still in search of their first ECAC postseason win after collecting their third regular season title in four years.
Last year, Quinnipiac sniper Sam Anas missed the conference final four after a lower-body injury in the previous round. Harvard took advantage in Lake Placid, opening up an early three-goal lead and not letting go despite a Bobcat surge in the second period.
Expect Anas to have better luck this time. The Bobcats arguably wound up with the toughest draw this weekend, but their speed and finesse should be too much for the hard-hitting Big Red.
Pick: Quinnipiac in two.
DARTMOUTH AT YALE
Remember when Harvard beat Dartmouth 7-0 in Hanover on Halloween? You probably don’t because you were out doing the Monster Mash in your “sexy Donald Trump” costume.
Since then, the inconceivable has become conceivable. Trump is on track to clinch the nomination, and Dartmouth has a shot at the NCAA tournament.
But just as Trump can’t risk a brokered convention, Dartmouth can’t count on an at-large bid. This Big Green team has shown resilience, but its season ends in New Haven.
Pick: Yale in three.
CLARKSON AT ST. LAWRENCE
The Clarskon Golden Knights will bus 10 miles down U.S. route 11 today to write another chapter in the greatest hockey rivalry that 300 people care about.
In all seriousness, this series is going to be a big deal in North Country, but consider this: if every resident of Canton and Potsdam, N.Y. showed up for a game at TD Garden, there would still be about 1,000 empty seats left.
Instead, the Saints and Golden Knights will meet today at St. Lawrence’s Appleton Arena, the greatest fire hazard in the ECAC. According to Clarkson’s Office of Student Life, Clarkson-SLU games usually follow university-organized “Spirit Days,” which often involve large bonfires. Thankfully, the university feeds the flames miles away from the wood-paneled, 65-year-old home of its cross-highway rival.
While all four of the weekend’s series could go either way, this one’s the most unpredictable. Clarkson needed three overtime periods over two games to dispatch of last-place Princeton last weekend, but the wins speak to the Golden Knights’ grit. Clarkson does not have one star who can take over a game like St. Lawrence has with sophomore goaltender Kyle Hayton, but the Pride of Potsdam enter this weekend with the momentum on its side.
Pick: Clarkson in three.
RENSSELAER AT HARVARD
Over his last two contests against the Crimson, RPI goaltender Jason Kasdorf has stopped 92 of 93 shots, handing Harvard a 0-0 tie and 2-1 loss in the process. In the latter game, the hosting Crimson outshot the Engineers, 50-22, forcing Kasdorf to make a career-high 49 saves. Harvard’s sole win against RPI this season, a 4-0 victory in the final of the Shillelagh Tournament in South Bend, came with Engineer freshman Cam Hackett in net.
While it might be easy to anoint Kasdorf as the Crimson Killer heading into this weekend, there’s something that feels fluky about these teams’ last two meetings. The scoreless tie came just a week after the Shillelagh. Meanwhile, the shot chart from Harvard’s losing effort suggests that game was less about Kasdorf’s brilliance than it was about a sputtering Crimson offense’s struggle to get grade-A opportunities in the slot.
In that respect, I have to give RPI’s defensive unit some credit for forcing Harvard to the outside, but as I’m sure Coach Donato would, I expect the hosts to find an extra “compete-level” around the net this weekend. The postseason always comes with an extra side-order of scrappiness. With that, the Engineers’ demonstrated puck-possession problems should come back to bite them.
Pick: Harvard in two.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a 29-game regular season in the books, the stage is now set. Playoff hockey has returned to Cambridge.
After finishing third in the ECAC, the No. 12/12 Harvard men’s hockey team will host a tournament quarterfinal series this weekend for the first time since 2012—the season before this year’s senior class, which includes co-captains Jimmy Vesey and Kyle Criscuolo, arrived on campus.
Besides coach Ted Donato ’91, the only link between the 2012 and 2016 editions of the Crimson is fifth-year senior Colin Blackwell, whose empty-netter in the final minute of last year’s ECAC championship game locked up the Whitelaw Cup—a cup that Harvard was hardly expected to hoist.
The ensuing banner-raising may have been unexpected, just not for a lack of talent. After all, this was a team that reached No. 1 in the PairWise rankings midway through the 2014-2015 season.
But a second-half slide, one that featured nine losses in 13 games, more than tempered postseason expectations, as Harvard slipped all the way to sixth in the conference.
In the process, the Crimson’s hopes for an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament all but dissolved. To have any shot of reaching the Big Dance, Harvard at the very least needed to reach a specific checkpoint: the conference semifinals in Lake Placid, N.Y.
“Last year when we were heading into the playoffs, we knew our backs were against the wall,” Criscuolo said. “We had to win games, and that helped us. That was a winning recipe for us. That’s sort of the way we’re looking at it [now]. We feel like... this is it, and we need to win this weekend to advance.”
Currently ranked 11th in the PairWise, the Crimson (16-9-4, 12-6-4 ECAC) would reach the 16-team NCAA tournament without a problem if the season ended today. However, since leagues award automatic bids to their tournament champions—teams that might not be ranked among the top 16—Harvard has little margin for error. A series loss this weekend would immediately place the Crimson’s season on life support.
Hoping to punch a ticket of its own, Rensselaer (18-13-7, 8-7-7) would like nothing more than to place Harvard on the ropes. Currently on the outside of the tournament picture looking in, the Engineers could jump into contention for an at-large bid with a win over the hosts, whom RPI has already beaten in Cambridge this year.
The two sides have met three times this season, including once in the championship game of the Shillelagh Tournament, which the Crimson won convincingly, 4-0. In the final two matchups, however, Harvard scored just one goal in two games—a 2-1 Engineer win at the Bright and a scoreless draw in Troy, N.Y.
Nonetheless, the Crimson’s recent lack of scoring against RPI cannot be attributed to a lack of offensive production. In fact, Harvard’s three highest shot outputs (50, 45, and 43) this year have all come against the Engineers. But after missing the two teams’ first meeting, RPI senior goaltender Jason Kasdorf played lights out in the final two, conceding a single score and keeping the Crimson out of the win column each time.
“Kasdorf is definitely a top-end goalie in college hockey, so we need to make the game hard for him and get traffic in front of the net,” sophomore forward Seb Lloyd said. “Then I think the series will definitely go our way.”
Criscuolo was also quick to praise the Engineer netminder.
“We don’t expect to get many second-chance opportunities,” the co-captain said. “But we’re going to do our best to [get] in the goalie’s eyes and be in front of the net.”
Coming off consecutive 33-save outings in a two-game sweep of Brown last weekend, Kasdorf is locked in a tie for fourth nationwide in save percentage. However, he did concede five goals to the Bears, including three in the first period of Game 2.
Nonetheless, RPI—a team known more for its defense than its offense—found a way to bail out its goaltender. The Engineers struck four times in a row on Saturday, and Kasdorf held his own over the final two periods, propelling the team into the quarterfinals against Harvard.
“They’re a hard working team,” Lloyd said. “They play well both ways. We’re going to have to be smart with the puck, but also we have to play with a lot of confidence out there and make plays.”
With two weeks of rest under the Crimson’s belt, there is little reason to believe that this matchup will be anything different from the ones before it. Once again you can expect Harvard to fire an inordinate number of shots at Kasdorf.
Across the ice, it will be up to sophomore netminder Merrick Madsen—playing in his first career playoff series—to prove himself as a worthy adversary.
So far against RPI, Madsen has done that. In three games against the Engineers, the sophomore has logged a .974 save percentage and two shutouts. Madsen was even named the Shillelagh Tournament’s Most Valuable Player following a 31-save clean sheet against RPI in the tournament finale.
However, it remains to be seen which Madsen will take the crease this weekend. Will it be the Madsen who has tamed the Engineers all year? The same Madsen who looked outstanding making a career-high 38 saves in the Crimson’s regular season finale against St. Lawrence? Or will it be the Madsen who has struggled with rebound control, particularly on a Clarkson game-winning goal just one night prior?
“He’s been really good for us,” Lloyd said. “I know that he’ll have a team in front of him playing really hard. The season’s on the line, and I think Merrick will definitely step up.”
Regardless of the result, this weekend will mark the final time Harvard’s seniors take the ice at the Bright-Landry Center. With students flocking out of the city for spring break, it remains to be seen what type of environment will await the two sides. But just ask Lloyd—the postseason is still the postseason.
“It may not be the best crowd we’ve had this year, but it’s playoff hockey,” Lloyd said. “There’s going to be no shortage of energy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After decades of independence, the Ivy League announced Thursday morning that it will be using men’s and women’s basketball tournaments to select its conference champions starting in the 2016-2017 season. Before establishing the four-team tournaments, which are slated to be held at The Palestra, the conference was the only one in the nation that used regular-season record, and not the outcome of a postseason tournament, to select a league champion.
In the absence of a tournament, the league’s regular-season champion had earned its automatic NCAA Tournament bid. Twice in the last five years, ties in the regular season standings on the men’s side had led to one-game playoffs for the title—with Harvard defeating Yale, 53-51, a year ago and losing to Princeton, 63-62, in 2011.
Harvard coach Tommy Amaker wrote in a statement that the conference tournament provides an opportunity to showcase the league during college basketball’s most intense time of the year.
“We are excited that the Ivy League will host an inaugural conference basketball tournament next season,” Amaker wrote. “This is a terrific opportunity to showcase the depth of our league—and to provide our student-athletes with the always meaningful experience of playing in the post-season.”
Proponents of the regular season model contended that it made every single game meaningful. Around the Ivy League, players and coaches refer to the grind—with back-to-back games on six consecutive early-semester weekends—as “The 14-Game Tournament,” something that has historically distinguished the league around the country.
However, both Ivy League Executive Director Robin Harris and Princeton men’s basketball head coach Mitch Henderson noted that the tournament, which will exclude half the league’s teams, does not destroy the importance of the regular season and will help the league build a better national brand.
"This is a great opportunity to showcase our talented student-athletes when all eyes are on college basketball,” Henderson said. “These tournaments enhance the importance of every single game of our conference schedule as our teams compete for the opportunity to be a part of a championship experience."
Under the new format, Harvard—which finished fourth in the league—would play Yale, the league champion, in the first men’s basketball semifinal. Princeton and Columbia, the league’s second- and third-place teams, would play in the other. On the women’s side, third-place Harvard would take on second-place Princeton for the right to play the winner of Penn and Dartmouth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard coach Tommy Amaker has consistently preached that the identity of his team is in the defense they play. Wednesday, the league’s coaches recognized senior Agunwa Okolie for his contributions on that end, naming him the Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year. It was the second straight year that a Harvard player has won the award, with former co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi ’15 taking the award a year ago.
Okolie routinely guarded the best perimeter player for the Crimson all season. When junior Zena Edosomwan—who was named to the All-Ivy League second team—was out, Okolie would guard forwards and centers at times. Among his assignments this year were National Player of the Year candidates Buddy Hield and Kris Dunn, BYU forward Kyle Collingsworth, Kansas wing Wayne Selden, and Yale point guard Makai Mason.
Known primarily as a defensive specialist as a starter last year, Okolie—an All-Ivy League honorable mention—took on a significantly bigger offensive role throughout the season for Harvard. He opened league play with a career-high 29 points in a home win against Dartmouth and averaged 13.2 points and 7.9 rebounds for the season, reaching double digits in 11 of 14 conference games.
Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, who called Okolie “the best player on the floor” after the Crimson’s Feb. 13 win over Brown, consistently singled out the senior for his play and effort throughout a disappointing conference season. After a game against Columbia in which Okolie sunk eight of 12 shots, notching 20 points, five rebounds, and five assists, Amaker noted the importance Okolie carried for the team.
“It’s obvious that he is our most important player,” Amaker said. “We’ve had to move him all around the floor; not only does he have to guard guys like that but we need him to score for us. He’s as productive and as efficient as anyone on the offensive end for us. There’s nothing more that we can ask him to accomplish for our team.”
