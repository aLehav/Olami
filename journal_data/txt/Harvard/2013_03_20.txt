After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Below is the text of a March 14 letter that was sent by 32 members of the History Department to Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith. The letter, which was authored by history professor Lisa M. McGirr, calls on Harvard to “repair the breach of trust in our community” caused by administrators' secret search of the email accounts of 16 resident deans last September. The names of the 32 cosigners—who include Walter Johnson, Daniel L. Smail, Charles S. Maier '60, Maya R. Jasanoff '96, Andrew D. Gordon, Alison Frank Johnson, and Sven Beckert—have been omitted from the signature of the letter.
 
 
March 14, 2013
Dean Michael Smith
Faculty of Arts and Sciences
University Hall
Cambridge, MA 02138
Dear Dean Smith,
We, the undersigned members of the Department of History, as scholars, teachers, and citizens of the university, are deeply concerned by the secret monitoring of the email of sixteen Resident Deans undertaken to uncover the source of a media leak. While we have read the recent response outlining the reasoning behind the searches, we believe that such surveillance, even within the narrow scope of this particular investigation, threatens the freedom of expression and the community of trust that are at the core of our great university. Surveillance of communications by members of our teaching community strikes us as a radical step and a departure from past policy. To engage in such practices leads down a slippery and dangerous slope and we wish to register our strong opposition.
The decision of the administration of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to monitor email communications raises concerns over the protection of privacy, speech, and dissent. Such actions are incompatible with the climate of trust among students, faculty, staff and the administration upon which the university has been built and upon which its international reputation rests. It points to a gap between faculty and administration understandings of our rights and responsibilities in an institution dedicated to fostering teaching, learning and the open exchange of ideas. In order to repair the breach of trust in our community, we must be certain that such a violation of restraints will not occur again and that email privacy will be protected. We call upon the university administration to provide such reassurance and to make every effort to restore a culture of trust and transparency in our collective academic mission.
Yours sincerely,
[32 members of the History Department]

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thirty-two members of the History Department sent a letter to Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith last Thursday, lodging “strong opposition” to Harvard’s decision to secretly search the email accounts of its 16 resident deans and imploring the administration to address what they characterized as a growing gap of trust within the University.
Authored by history professor Lisa M. McGirr and signed by a number of senior faculty in the History Department, including Walter Johnson, Daniel L. Smail, Charles S. Maier '60, Maya R. Jasanoff '96, and Andrew D. Gordon, the letter warned that covertly searching communications “leads down a slippery and dangerous slope.” It suggested that unless administrators take steps to mend the “breach of trust” caused by the secret email search, the free exchange of ideas so paramount to the Harvard community could be hampered.
“While we have read the recent response outlining the reasoning behind the searches, we believe that such surveillance, even within the narrow scope of this particular investigation, threatens the freedom of expression and the community of trust that are at the core of our great university,” the two-paragraph letter reads.
The letter, which was cosigned by more than half of the History Department, is the first known group effort by faculty to question administrators since news broke on March 9 that Smith and the University General Counsel had authorized the covert search last September as they scrambled to plug a leak of confidential information related to the Government 1310 cheating case.
“Such actions are incompatible with the climate of trust among students, faculty, staff and the administration upon which the university has been built and upon which its international reputation rests,” the letter reads. “It points to a gap between faculty and administration understandings of our rights and responsibilities in an institution dedicated to fostering teaching, learning and the open exchange of ideas.”
Using strong language, the letter concludes by calling on administrators to guarantee “that such a violation of restraints will not occur again and that email privacy will be protected.”
The letter raises the possibility that faculty could form something of a unified front in challenging administrators on their handling of the search. Since the search first became public, many faculty have said they expect the searches to be the subject of much discussion at April’s faculty meeting and potentially even a faculty investigation. But the details of how that might happen are uncertain. So too is the degree to which faculty might push back, following what some have described as a shift in the balance of power away from professors and towards the administration in recent years.
History professors had received no response to the letter from Smith as of late Friday, according to McGirr. And with the University on spring break until next Monday, faculty members said they do not expect any major developments in the case this week.
In separate interviews last week, individual members of the History Department who signed the letter said that the searches have already had a chilling effect on communication among their ranks and the community as a whole. Even if their accounts were not monitored, every segment of the community is implicitly affected by the searches as the free exchange of ideas is strained, McGirr said.
History professor Alison Frank Johnson, who signed the letter, added that without reassurance from administrators that email searches of this kind have been handled differently in the past, confidence among faculty that their correspondence is unthreatened will not be restored.
“What I need to hear from the administration is that either this hasn’t ever happened—that this is the first time they’ve done something like this—or that it has, but they have informed everyone that was involved,” Johnson said.
History professor Sven Beckert, another of the letter’s signers, echoed Johnson, writing in an email that the primary concern raised by the searches is one of trust. There is a difference, he said, between the privacy practices of a corporation and those of a university, even if both are legally permissible.
“It raises the issue of university governance—do we want a university that is based on mutual trust and respect, or do we want a university that is run like any other large American corporation,” Beckert wrote.
Johnson said that professors enter academia expecting to enjoy a greater deal of freedom and privacy than might be afforded in the corporate world. Threats to that freedom of expression and privacy undermine the very idea of a university, she said.
“If you're working for a place and you imagine that this is the professional community that defines your identity, your livelihood, your life, for the rest of your life as long as you are working, then the nature of that community is very important. And I don't want to work for a corporation that worries about its brand,” Johnson said. “I want to work for a university that worries about learning and knowledge.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kicking off a week-long trip to Asia, University President Drew G. Faust met with 30 alumni and business leaders in Hong Kong Monday to discuss the opportunities and challenges presented by edX’s rapid growth.
EdX, the virtual learning initiative launched by Harvard and MIT last May, has since expanded to include 12 institutions of higher education on three continents. Harvard faculty offer courses through HarvardX, Harvard’s branch of the online platform.
“The hunger for knowledge is so strong around the world,” Faust said, according to the Harvard Gazette. “I feel [HarvardX] is a magnificent opportunity, but it is also a big responsibility for us to set a standard for online learning that upholds the most important aspects of higher education and its values, and allows Harvard to play a leadership role in shaping how education changes in the years to come.”
In remarks at the meeting, HarvardX faculty director Robert A. Lue said that 102 Harvard faculty members have voiced interest in becoming a part of HarvardX. Lue, who is also a professor of the practice of molecular and cellular biology, discussed the prospect of EdX programming that would reach beyond its online platform, which could allow for increased collaboration and more audience-specific teaching.
To this end, Lue cited discussions among Harvard public health professors about the possibility of modifying an edX course to target families in Boston. Such an adaptation, which might focus in on an issue like childhood obesity, is “an example of the content bringing people together rather than keeping them apart,” he said.
In Hong Kong on Monday, Faust also visited Harvard Business School’s Asia-Pacific Research Center, met with representatives from universities in the area, and spoke to over 400 people at an event for Harvard alumni.
Later this week, Faust will travel to Seoul, where she will speak and receive an award from Ewha Womans University—a prominent women’s university—for her work towards “the improvement of women’s social status as the first female [president of Harvard] and renowned historian,” according to an Ewha official quoted by South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency.
Faust’s trip to Asia this week is not the first of her presidency. In January 2012, she visited India, where she also sought to strengthen Harvard’s ties with Asia and spoke of the ways that technology is changing education around the world. Faust also spent time in Japan and China in March 2010.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s basketball team learned late on Monday night that it will face the Hawks of the University of Hartford in the first round of the WNIT tournament on Thursday night in West Hartford, Conn.
The Crimson earned its spot in the WNIT by securing second place in the Ivy League with a resounding 71-26 win against Columbia.
The Hawks (21-11, 10-6 America East) have been a consistently high-caliber team, traveling to the postseason in each of the last nine seasons, and winning their previous meeting with the Crimson, 72-61, last year. They are led by senior forward Nikkia Smith in both points and rebounds per game, with 10.6 and 5.3, respectively.
“Hartford is a perennially strong team,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “[Hartford coach] Jen Rizzotti is a great coach…but I think we match up well, and I’m looking forward to it.”
“[Smith] is a very talented player,” the coach added. “We played them last year, and they have all the same players back from last year’s game. We played them close, [but] they won. We are a pretty different team now, [while] they are a very veteran team. They have a bunch of seniors and are probably disappointed that they did not make the NCAA’s.”
Hartford lost in the finals of the America East Championship to Albany, who will fill the AEC’s spot at the NCAA tournament while the Hawks go to the WNIT.
Harvard (20-8, 11-3 Ivy) is coming off an impressive seven-game winning streak to end the season, consisting of wins against Yale, Penn, and Ivy League champion Princeton. The Crimson will look to ride that momentum into West Hartford.
“We need to keep doing what we’ve been doing,” said junior guard Christine Clark, who is Harvard’s leading scorer. “We need to play great defense, contain them on rebounding, and offensively keep having the great chemistry that we’ve had recently.”
This is Harvard’s fourth time in the WNIT out of the last five years. Last year, Harvard became the first member of the Ivy League to win a game in the WNIT with a 73-71 victory over Hofstra.
“I hope [winning a tournament game] helps, because we have enough returning players that that matters,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think it matters a lot that they were in that environment and they know what it is going to be like. I think it will help us.”
In addition to Clark, the Crimson is led by senior guard Victoria Lippert and sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle. The three of them average 15.7, 13.5, and 12.3 points per game, respectively, each individually more than Hartford’s leader in Smith. Fagbenle leads the team in rebounding as well with 7.8 per game, also more than the Hartford-leading Smith.
“They are going to have to find a way to stop our inside game,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think Temi [Fagbenle] should be a force.”
This game features two teams with very contrasting styles and tempos. Harvard scores 68 points per game and allows 62, whereas Hartford scores 58 and allows 54.
“They are a very strong defensive team,” Delaney Smith said. “They create a lot of turnovers, they create a lot of steals…. I think we need to take care of the ball. They are very physical and they are very active in the passing lanes.”
This is not the first time that Harvard has played a strong defensive team. Delaney-Smith emphasized that the Crimson has encountered this type of team in Yale and Columbia during the regular season, and came out on top in both series.
“We feel that we are ready for that kind of a defensive team,” Delaney-Smith said. “[We are] more ready than we were last year.”
This season, Harvard is 11-0 at home but has struggled on the road. All six of the team’s losses were away. Additionally, against the seven teams that the Crimson played in each team’s arena, Harvard averaged a point differential 14 points higher at Lavietes Pavillion than on the opponent’s court.
“We’ve won enough road games that being on the road doesn’t make me nervous,” Delaney-Smith said. “They have an advantage, but we’ll step up for that.”
The winner of the Harvard-Hartford game will challenge the winner of a Drexel-Iona matchup that is also occurring on Thursday night. The second-round game will take place at some point this coming weekend.
“I think that it is a great matchup for us,” Clark said, “We have a great opportunity to win and move on further in the tournament.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From 2011-12 to 2012-13, few college basketball players in the country improved their production more than Harvard sophomore Wesley Saunders.
The wing has gone from a benchwarmer who averaged just 3.3 points in 13.9 minutes per game a year ago to a star who led the Ivy League with 16.5 points in 37.3 minutes per contest, the 11th-most in the country.
The strange thing is, that quantum leap did not really surprise anyone at all.
The Los Angeles native arrived in Cambridge in the fall of 2011 having crossed the country to attend college. Rated the 88th-best prospect in the nation by Rivals after leading Windward High to a state championship, he turned down offers from Colorado, USC, San Diego State, and Penn to play for Tommy Amaker.
Last season, on the deepest team in program history, even the highly-touted rookie struggled to find playing time. But over the summer, the talented wing set out to earn a larger place in his squad’s rotation during his second season.
“He didn’t play a lot [last year], and I think that was very motivating for him,” Amaker says. “He really did a terrific job this past summer of how hard he worked to get better.”
One of the things Saunders improved was his jumper, and the results have been evident. After not even attempting a three last season, the sophomore shot 52.6 percent from long distance during the regular season.
“I worked on my shooting and ball handling a lot [over the summer],” Saunders says. “A lot of it [was] getting mentally prepared for the whole season.”
Those preparations began during the team’s four-game tour of Italy in August, when the wing’s improvements were on immediate display.
Despite the presence of the team’s top three returning scorers—former co-captains Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry and junior forward Laurent Rivard—it was Saunders who shined, leading the team to a 4-0 record. During that trip, he paced the squad with 16.5 points per game, highlighted by a 21-point, six-rebound, four-assist performance against Paffoni Omegna.
“Italy was great,” Saunders says. “It showed the improvements that I made during the [offseason], and I [that] could carry [them] over to the regular season.”
Amaker too came away thinking that the sophomore was someone who would play a major role on his 2012-13 team.
“Wesley was by far our best player [in Italy], and he knew that,” Amaker says. “We told him that we were very impressed and pleased, and I think that really propelled him into this year from a confidence standpoint that he saw how well he played.”
Shortly after the team returned to the United States, Saunders learned he would be asked to play an even larger role, as news broke that Casey and Curry would be leaving the team due to their alleged involvement in the Gov 1310 scandal.
Saunders was now the team’s fourth-leading returning scorer, and his ability to get to the basket meant he was expected to rank much higher on that list in 2012-13.
In the preseason, it appeared that the sophomore would be up to the task.
“Before you can become a good player, you have to become a good practice player,” Amaker says. “[Saunders] really worked on becoming more of a consistently good practice player, and I thought that gave him confidence and his teammates were confident in him.”
The improvements in practice translated into games. The wing’s production was remarkably steady, as he scored in double figures every game while shooting 53.6 percent from the floor.
“I can’t say enough about how he has performed for us throughout the season,” Amaker says. “He’s been incredibly consistent this year. I think that was the thing that I’ve been pleased with more than anything.”
A unanimous First Team All-Ivy selection, Saunders maintained his strong performance through conference play, when he averaged 17 points per contest, including a career-high 27 against Columbia on Feb. 10.
But it is not just at the offensive end where Saunders has made a major contribution.
The team’s best perimeter defender—he led the conference with 1.9 steals per game—Saunders was often tasked with guarding the opponent’s premier player, whether that was a point guard such as Columbia’s Brian Barbour or a power forward such as Princeton’s Ian Hummer.
“That [was] just a challenge that coach had for me coming into the season,” Saunders says. “He told me he’d have me covering the best player and he wanted me to lead us on offense.”
On Thursday, that weight will likely fall on the sophomore’s shoulders one more time, as a big two-way game from Saunders will be necessary if Harvard is going to earn its first-ever NCAA tournament win.
“We want to go out and compete and do our best and do the things that we have been doing,” Saunders says. “If we play the way that we are supposed to play, then good things will happen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Harvard’s tournament fate decided—the Crimson will head to Salt Lake City to take on the University of New Mexico Lobos (Thursday, 9:50 ET)—David Freed profiles the matchup from every angle. 
 
According to most common metrics, Harvard may be one of the unluckiest teams in the country. With all due respect to the Libertys and Florida Gulf Coasts of the world, looking around the draw, it would be easy for the Crimson to hang its heads. New Mexico is ranked second in the RPI, indicative of a dramatic underseeding. The Lobos won both the regular season and conference tournament of the Mountain West, a tough conference arguably better than the Big 12 and Pac 12 that sent five teams to the tournament. Fellow three seed Marquette won neither its conference’s regular season title outright nor its conference tournament and, according to Ken Pomeroy, is ranked about three or four seeds to high. But a number of silver linings exist for the Crimson. Digging deeper into the matchup, the numbers show that New Mexico is, in fact, a fairly decent draw for Harvard.
Common Opponents:
The Crimson and the Lobos played only one common opponent on the year: The University of Connecticut. Banned from postseason play this year, the Huskies are a formidable opponent who knocked off Syracuse and Michigan State during the year. The UConn starting backcourt of Shabazz Napier and Ryan Boatwright has an NBA future. The Huskies defeated the Crimson, 57-49, at Gampel Pavilion in mid-November but lost to the Lobos, 60-66, a pair of weeks earlier at a neutral location. 
What can we infer from this? Well, the margins of victory show both games to be close, but New Mexico has the clear advantage. With inside post play from Alex Kirk (11.9 ppg, 7.9 rpg, 1.8 bpg), the Lobos have a stronger deterrent inside to prevent opposing guards from crashing the lane. Until the late-season emergence of Kenyatta Smith, the Crimson lacked such an enforcer. Both teams outrebounded the Huskies, but the Crimson gave up 31 points to the UConn front line, including 23 to forward DeAndre Daniels. By contrast, the Lobos gave up only 9 points to Daniels and 15 total to the front line. The Crimson also allowed the Huskies to shoot 52 percent from the field, while the Lobos held the Huskies to 43 percent shooting. But this is likely a function of the Lobos’ strong interior defense, as the UConn backcourt shot only 9-of-24 (37.5 percent) against the Crimson.
Strength of Schedule/Notable Wins:
This category clearly tilts in favor of the Lobos, whose conference is one of the best in America and features tournament teams Boise State, UNLV,  Colorado State, and San Diego State. While the Crimson’s toughest conference opponent—Princeton—ranks just 116 overall according to the BPI (a metric adjusting a team’s winning percentage based on the teams it plays and its winning percentages as well as margins of victory), the Mountain West features five teams ranked in the BPI’s top 45.
Outside of conference, the Crimson played quite a few teams but came away with few notable wins. Although the team defeated the California Golden Bears, a 12 seed in the tournament, 67-62, it could not close down the stretch against St. Mary’s (11 seed, 70-69) and Memphis (six seed, 60-50). New Mexico similarly has few marquee wins outside of conference, taking down UConn and Cincinnati (ranked eighth in the county at the time, the Bearcats are now a 10 seed in the tournament). Notably, the Lobos lost to Saint Louis (4 seed, 60-46) and South Dakota State (13 seed, 70-65) in a three-game stretch after winning its first twelve games.
Advanced Metrics:
Although the RPI loves the Lobos, placing it second in the country, the BPI has it slightly lower at ninth. It ranks its strength of schedule eighth in the country, ahead of notable teams like Duke, Indiana, and Louisville. Ken Pomeroy is even less of a fan of the Lobos, ranking them just 17th in his rankings, right behind Creighton and St. Louis. Pomeroy ranks the Lobos’ defensive efficiency as 11th in the country, while their offense checks in as just the 45th best.
But the Lobos outrank Harvard in every category. The Crimson rank just 83rd and 147th in offense and defense, respectively. While the Lobos have 10 wins against the BPI top 50, the Crimson is 0-3 and just 3-7 against the top 150 (the Lobos are 24-5 by comparison).
Also of note is that the Lobos get 25 percent of their points off of free throws, a good sign for the Crimson. Officials tend to call the NCAA tournament looser than most games, which bodes well for Harvard. Similarly, Harvard’s worst weakness—rebounding—will be mitigated some by the New Mexico lineup. The Crimson gives up nearly ten offensive rebounds a game and is 334th in the country in rebounding. The Lobos are only 142nd overall in rebounding—good but not great.
But the team starts three players listed as 6'7" or taller, including the seven-footer, Kirk. Another stat that bodes well for the Crimson is that the Lobos are 240th in the nation in three-point percentage defense, while Harvard is seventh nationally in shooting from long distance. But New Mexico is 14th in the nation in two-point defense, so the Crimson will have to win this game behind the arc.
The Crimson does not match up well with the Lobos, but as a 14 seed Harvard is not in a place to complain about its matchup. The three-point defense and free-throw tendencies of New Mexico stand out as areas in which the Crimson will have to take advantage to win. Harvard will struggle against the large New Mexico front line and it will require an uncharacteristic performance from the steady and fundamentally sound Lobos to win. The odds are not tilted in Harvard’s favor, but—as always—three-point shooting may prove to be the Crimson’s saving grace.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Harvard’s tournament fate decided—the Crimson will head to Salt Lake City to take on the University of New Mexico Lobos (Thursday, 9:50 ET)—David Freed profiles the matchup from every angle. 
 
Harvard’s matchup with New Mexico doesn’t look good on paper and is worse the more you dig through the matchups. Although the Crimson caught a couple of breaks—namely with the suspension of the Lobos’ best bench player, Demetrius Walker—the size of New Mexico up front will be a big challenge for Harvard. By looking at each matchup, one can see the Crimson will need its backcourt to outplay the Lobos’ to have a shot at pulling the upset.
 
Point Guard: Siyani Chambers vs. Hugh Greenwood
For the Crimson to shock the world, Chambers needs to dominate this matchup. Greenwood is a big guard and at six-three he has the length to close off the freshman’s angles and cut off driving lanes. The onus will be on Chambers to find ways to the hoop and to contain Greenwood, who shoots 36 percent from deep and averages seven points a game. With Greenwood expected to play more minutes than usual (see below), Chambers may have a chance late in the game to exploit his opponent’s fatigue.
Shooting Guard: Wesley Saunders vs. Kendall Williams
Easily the most important matchup on the floor, Harvard needs Saunders to contain Williams in order to have a chance at a victory. Saunders is Harvard’s best player and perimeter defender and boasts outstanding range (52.6 percent from beyond the arc) and hands (1.9 steals per game). Williams is famous for his 46-point game against Colorado State in late February, and he can fill it up from anywhere on the floor. Saunders is bigger than Williams (6'6" to 6'4") and will attempt to use his length to force Williams into errant shots. On offense, Saunders’ ability to drive and finish in traffic will be invaluable for a Crimson offense that struggles when it cannot produce open three-point looks.
Small Forward: Laurent Rivard vs. Tony Snell
Snell is the second best player on the Lobos’ roster and their best shooter. It is appropriate, then, that he is matched up with Rivard. Rivard and Snell both shoot about 40 percent from deep, and have nearly identical free throw conversion rates (84.3 percent for Snell, 84.4 percent for Rivard). Snell has two inches on Rivard and can back down the smaller guard. At times this season, Crimson opponents have isolated Rivard on defense and the Canadian will have to hold his own against the athletic Snell.
Power Forward: Steve Moundou-Missi vs. Cameron Bairstow
Although usually Christian Webster’s spot, the Crimson may be forced to go big early against the large front line of the Lobos. Bairstow, the six-nine Australian, averages nearly 10 points and six rebounds a game and would overpower the smaller Webster. Moundou-Missi does not provide the floor spacing of the senior, but his versatility and quickness allows him to get out in the open court and let the Crimson play its preferred fast pace. If Webster plays, look for him to front the taller Bairstow and try to deny entry passes on defense and force the Australian to guard him on the perimeter on defense, where Bairstow has to respect Webster’s 37 percent stroke from behind the arc.
Center: Kenyatta Smith vs. Alex Kirk
Going up against a seven-footer, it is hugely important that Harvard’s sophomore forward not draw fouls. Smith is the only true insider defensive presence on the Crimson roster and when he leaves the floor, Moundou-Missi and Jonah Travis cannot fill the same void. Smith’s long wingspan makes him a tremendous shot blocker, but he will be going up against a much larger opponent on Kirk, who averages nearly a double-double. On the offensive side on the floor, look for Harvard coach Tommy Amaker to go to Smith early to force the Lobos off the Crimson shooters.
Bench:
The Lobos play only about eight rotation players, one more than the Crimson. But with junior Demetrius Walker being suspended, the Lobos lose a backup for point guard Hugh Greenwood—who usually plays only about 28 minutes a game—and a valuable 40 percent shooter from behind the arc. This cuts New Mexico to a seven-man rotation, much like the Crimson, who bring only sophomore forward Moundou-Missi and Travis off the bench. With Greenwood having no true backup, combined with Amaker’s tendency to ride Chambers, expect Chambers to play the entire game against the Lobos. Likewise, Saunders will be counted on to defend Williams for every minute the junior Lobo forward is on the floor. Also expect a larger role from Moundou-Missi and Travis against the larger New Mexico front line.
The matchup between Harvard and New Mexico is a clash of styles. The smaller Crimson likes to spread the floor with shooters and use Smith as a way of opening up shots. The Lobos’ feature a star guard in Williams and a strong supporting player in Snell, but its main strength is its large front line. Kirk and company will keep Harvard focused on denying the ball inside, daring the Lobos to beat them from the outside. At almost every position, Harvard will be outsized. While the Crimson are used to this—both Penn and Princeton’s big men dwarf Harvard’s inside presence—it will need to overcome these barriers once again to move to the round of 32.

Harvard football may not compete at the highest level collegiately, but every year, players from Crimson coach Tim Murphy’s program garner interest from the highest level professionally, the National Football League. This year, senior tight end Kyle Juszczyk has been receiving a lot of pro attention and could become the first Harvard football player to be selected by a team in the NFL draft since quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05.
According to NFL.com’s Gil Brandt, Juszczyk projects as a late-fifth or sixth round pick. Fitzpatrick was selected by the Rams in the fifth round of the 2005 draft.
Juszczyk, who was a two-time FCS All-American at tight end, has decided to make the transition to fullback, where his toughness and blocking ability will be more suited to the pro game. ESPN Insider and draft guru Mel Kiper Jr. considers Juszczyk to be the No. 1 fullback in this year’s draft class.
During his career, Juszczyk was named to three All-Ivy teams and was a member of the 2011 Ivy League-champion Crimson. He leaves Harvard in the top-ten all-time in career receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns.
Juszczyk demonstrated his strength and speed at Harvard’s Mar. 14 Pro Day, where Juszczyk, Ivy League MVP quarterback Colton Chapple, All-Ivy running back Treavor Scales, All-Ivy guard John Collins, All-Ivy defensive end John Lyon, and All-Ivy punter Jacob Dombrowski, as well as nine other non-Harvard players, worked out for 15 NFL teams.
The 6’1”, 248-pound fullback/tight end tallied 24 reps of 225 pounds on the bench press and clocked a 4.77 40-yard dash. Scales ran the fastest 40 in 4.45 seconds and had the highest vertical of the day at 41 inches.
None of the other Crimson prospects project as draft picks, but in the recent past, a number of Harvard graduates have been given a chance in the NFL as undrafted free agents. Defensive lineman Desmond Bryant ’09 signed as an undrafted free agent with the Oakland Raiders and recently signed with the Cleveland Browns for $34 million. Offensive lineman Kevin Murphy ’12 signed with the San Francisco 49ers. Ivy League defensive player of the year Josue Ortiz ’11 received attention from a number of NFL teams before ultimately not finding a place in the league. Similarly, former captain Collin Zych ’11 attended the Dallas Cowboys’ training camp before being cut in 2011.
The NFL Draft begins on April 25 and concludes April 27.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SALT LAKE CITY, Utah—In the midst of Open Practice Day at EnergySolutions Arena, brackets are everywhere. From the posters on the wall in the media room to the hundreds of printable brackets floating around, every writer has an opinion to share about tomorrow’s West Region games.
Finally out of their Cambridge bubble, the Harvard basketball beat writers take a look at what the national media is saying about the Crimson’s matchup with the No. 3 Lobos.
Vegas Line:
New Mexico minus-11
ESPN’s Dave Tuley:
"The Tony Snell and Kendall Williams combination will be too much for Harvard, which lacks the playing experience necessary to compete with New Mexico coming from the Ivy League and not having gone through a post-season conference tournament."
ESPN’s Jay Bilas:
"The Lobos’ clean defense and ability to get to the line will overcome Harvard’s 40 percent three-point shooting."
Fox News:
"The top scoring combination of Siyani Chambers and Wes Saunders will be hard pressed to hold off a more complete New Mexico team that relies on Williams to dish the ball to Snell and Alex Kirk."
NESN:
"Harvard is at a disadvantage without a conference tournament because it hasn’t played since closing out its season against Cornell two weeks ago. New Mexico has the number two RPI in the country and is riding high on its success in the Mountain West tournament."
The Quad (New York Times):
"New Mexico lives and dies by its defense. The low scoring and relatively inefficient offensive Lobos’ greatest weakness would be against a strong three-point shooting team."
SB Nation Mid-Major Madness:
"Chambers and Laurent Rivard contribute to an efficient offense for the Crimson. New Mexico has suffered some startling road losses, but are generally more athletic and deeper than the Crimson."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SALT LAKE CITY—The Harvard men’s basketball team took the court at EnergySolutions arena for the first time during Wednesday evening’s open practice.
With just over 24 hours to go until its second round NCAA Tournament matchup with No. 3 New Mexico, the No. 14 Crimson joined seven other West Region teams in an afternoon of press conferences and preparation.
During the student-athlete portion of the conference, Harvard was represented by co-captains Laurent Rivard and Christian Webster, as well as sophomore wing and leading scorer Wesley Saunders.
The trio addressed the adversity that the Crimson has faced after being forced to adjust to the loss of co-captains Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry, who took a leave of absence before the start of the season. They credited Harvard coach Tommy Amaker and the coaching staff for helping them adjust to a young starting lineup that relies primarily on Saunders on freshman point guard Siyani Chambers to put points on the board.
“Coach Amaker has done probably his best coaching job ever with us, and it’s been an amazing year because of...getting through that adversity,” said Webster, the Crimson's only remaining senior. “I think it’s a testament to the coaching staff and how they kept us believing.”
Belief was a common theme for the evening as Amaker took the stage and credited his players with bringing Harvard back to the Big Dance.
When asked how reaching the tournament the second time around was special, Amaker stated that overcoming expectations made this season different.
“I give all the credit to our players,” Amaker said. “I thought they were magnificent this year with the belief and trust and all the things that are necessary to put yourself in this position when you know you have to overcome some pretty big hurdles to get to this point.”
In discussing the matchup between the Crimson and the Lobos, the major focus was the difference in size between the two squads. New Mexico’s starting lineup includes seven-foot sophomore center Alex Kirk and 6’9” junior forward Cameron Bairstow, two major scoring threats in the paint. Harvard has employed a four-guard lineup throughout the majority of the season, using its three sophomore bigs in rotation. Of the trio, Kenyatta Smith stands the tallest at 6’8”.
The Crimson players stated that they had not yet watched game tape of the Lobos but that they would draw from their experience against other tall lineups during the non-conference season.
Against Cal, Harvard managed to pull out the win, largely thanks to the defensive effort of Saunders, who has often been tasked with playing tight defense on the opponent's leading scoring threat. Webster also discussed the matchups with Connecticut and Memphis—both losses—during which the Crimson played stretches of competitive basketball.
Discussing the Lobos’ size, Amaker emphasized the need to stay out of foul trouble—an issue for Smith, Jonah Travis, and Steve Moundou-Missi this season—and said that he would draw from Harvard’s strength on the perimeter to match up with New Mexico’s tight defense.
“We haven’t been very deep, as you know, and we have a point of emphasis on not making silly fouls,” Amaker said. “We have played other teams that have had good size. We have tried to spread the floor and use our quickness. Being smaller, there are advantages that we have.... We have to shoot the ball well, box them out, and keep them off the backboard—something that we haven’t done very well this season.”
Amaker outlined Harvard’s plan going forward in preparation for tomorrow night’s tip off at 9:50 EST. In addition to the open practice that immediately followed the media sessions, the team will spend the evening looking at the scouting report and film with the coaching staff.
Amaker highlighted the need to stay healthy—stating that the Crimson may forgo a shootaround tomorrow—and use the practice time as a way to get acclimatized to the altitude and court at EnergySolutions.
Webster, Rivard, and Saunders agreed that being at the tournament for the second time made the adjustment easier. Among Harvard’s lineup, Chambers is the only player without tournament experience.
“One thing that caught us off guard [last year] was that walk out onto the floor the first time, seeing the blue NCAA logo on the floor,” Rivard said. “We had dreamed all of our lives to get there. But now this year is the second time around, and hopefully we will be calmer and have more poise. We aren’t going play a perfect game…but hopefully it will help us control our emotions and be more relaxed on the floor.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SALT LAKE CITY—The Harvard men’s basketball team felt the absence of point guard Corbin Miller when it travelled to Miller’s hometown for the second round of the NCAA tournament.
Miller—a native of Salt Lake City suburb Sandy—took a two-year leave after his freshman season to go on a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
Junior co-captain Laurent Rivard, sophomore forward Wesley Saunders, and Crimson coach Tommy Amaker discussed their ongoing relationship with Miller in their press conferences on Wednesday evening.
“He’s on his mission, so he can’t talk much,” Rivard said. “But he sent us a couple of emails that coach posted in the locker room. It’s always good to have news from him.”
The 6’2” point guard averaged 3.8 points in 11.6 minutes per game. Miller was the Crimson’s most efficient free throw and three-point shooter, sinking 80 percent of his shots from the stripe and 45.6 percent from the arc.
“We miss him, and there’s no question about it,” Amaker said. “Every time I have a chance to communicate and email with him, believe me, I say that to him. He was an outstanding shooter and scorer for us last year as a freshman, and I think he’s going to continue to do really, really neat things for Harvard.”
Though Miller’s playing time was limited behind Harvard’s starting backcourt of Oliver McNally ’12 and Brandyn Curry, the freshman came up big in a number of games. Miller scored in double digits four times during the season and saw playing time in all but three games, which he sat out due to injury.
Miller’s moment in the sun came at Penn, when the Crimson pulled out a 56-50 win at the Palestra last February. The freshman posted a career-high 17 points—including nine from three—on 50 percent shooting from the field, and he added three free throws in the final 33 seconds that kept Harvard’s perfect conference record intact.
Miller will return for the 2014-2015 season and will have three more years of eligibility.
“I hope he’s doing well and doing everything he needs to do on his mission, and we can’t wait to get him back because he’s definitely a great addition to our team and a great shooter,” Saunders said. “Whenever he gets back we’re going to accept him back with open arms.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SALT LAKE CITY—The University of New Mexico Lobos are back in the NCAA tournament for the second straight season, but this year seems to be different.
Sure, the Lobos are once again coming off a sweep of the Mountain West regular season and tournament championships. But—unlike in previous years—New Mexico seems to be getting recognition for its success.
According to head coach Steve Alford, that hasn’t always been the case.
“When you look at it three, four years ago when we were in the NCAA tournament, I don’t think anybody even knew about us, and we were [29-4] that year,” said Alford on Wednesday, a day before his team’s matchup with the Harvard men’s basketball team in the second round of the tournament.
With each victory this season, the Lobos seemed to inch further into the spotlight. New Mexico earned non-conference wins over Connecticut, USC, and Cincinnati and closed the season on a 9-1 run.
After opening the season outside the Top 25, the Lobos head into the postseason ranked No. 10 in the nation.
“Now there is more attention, and there is more momentum there,” said Alford, whose team was awarded a No. 3 seed, giving them the highest seed of any team from outside a Power Six conference aside from No. 1 Gonzaga. “That’s good for us nationally, something that we have been thriving and striving to do in the last six years, and we’re seeing headway now.”
The Lobos still have more work to do as they enter the NCAA tournament for the third time in the past four seasons.
Despite playing in the tournament 13 times, New Mexico has yet to string together two consecutive wins. In 2010, the third-seeded Lobos topped Montana in their opener but fell in the next round to No. 11 Washington. Last season, New Mexico received a No. 5 seed and bested Long Beach State, but was stopped by Louisville in the following contest.
“We’re pleased with what we have done, but we have pretty much been playing the whole year for this tournament,” said New Mexico guard Kendall Williams, who was named the Mountain West Player of the Year. “It’s nice to kind of accomplish those championships along the way. But we feel like we’re just getting started.”
This year, the Lobos appear poised to break through to the Sweet 16, with some pundits labeling New Mexico a dark horse to reach the Final Four.
Even with such high expectations, New Mexico claims to be focused on its opener with the underdog Crimson.
“We’re going to take it game by game, starting with Harvard, and try to take a run just like everybody else is,” Williams said.
Harvard coach Tommy Amaker and the rest of the Crimson certainly aren’t overlooking Thursday’s opponent.
“They can score inside. They have great size. They have athleticism. They shoot the ball from the perimeter,” said Amaker, who matched up against Alford both as a player at Duke and as a coach at Michigan. “They can score with the best of teams.”
The Lobos boast three double-figure scorers and had all five starters named to all-conference teams. The group is led by Williams, who averages 13.5 points per game and was named to the Mountain West First Team, Alex Kirk (11.9 points, 7.9 rebounds) and Cameron Bairstow (9.6 points, 5.9 rebounds) anchor the team down low, while 6’7” guard Tony Snell provides 12.6 points per game.
“I think [Alford’s] one of those guys, too, that I’m not sure he’s gotten enough credit for the job that he’s done in every place that he’s been as a coach,” Amaker said. “But we recognize how good this team is.”
Amaker recognizes it. The Crimson recognizes it. The Mountain West Conference recognizes it. And, in a few weeks, the rest of the country might finally recognize it too.
