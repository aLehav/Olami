After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 2009 Faculty Development and Diversity Annual Report reveals that Harvard has made substantial progress over the past several years in finding more ladder faculty who are women or minorities.
Minorities currently make up 17 percent of the faculty, an increase of 23 percent since 2003, while women hold 26 percent of professor, associate professor, and assistant professor positions, representing a 16 - percent increase over the past six years.
It is heartening to see the diversity of an institution still associated with old, white males increase, and the trend will likely continue as more well qualified minority and female professors are hired. However, it is notable that women and persons of color still hold disproportionately few of Harvard’s prestigious tenure-track appointments.
The gender imbalance will likely continue to fade away as the faculty ages, as women are more prevalent at the assistant professor and associate professor levels than as full professors, reflecting changing hiring practices over time and the healthy crop of new female Ph.Ds emerging from graduate departments.
However, the low minority representation is more problematic. Judith D. Singer, senior vice provost for Faculty Development and Diversity, who oversaw the faculty diversity report, explained “We’re trying to get more minority faculty into every level of the University in all fields…The numbers of minority Ph.Ds who want to go into academia are simply too low, especially when it comes to blacks, Latinos, and Native American faculty.” This dearth of eligible minority candidates impedes Harvard’s efforts to diversify its faculty while still recruiting the nation’s brightest minds.
Harvard should continue to bring the most distinguished scholars possible to Cambridge, and not compromise this practice in order to find more minority faculty. Instead, the University should continue to encourage minority students to pursue careers as academics in order to help ensure diversity in the future.
Harvard has already made some progress on this front. The Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship, for example,  attempts “To counter the serious shortage of faculty of color in higher education” by allowing minority students to work closely with a faculty member on their research while receiving financial support from the program. Through initiatives like this, more minority scholars will emerge in the next few years, enhancing Harvard’s ability to hire top-quality faculty from a variety of backgrounds.
In the mean time, the University should continue to make small steps on the path toward becoming an institution whose faculty reflects the diversity of its student body.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It has been almost three months since General McChrystal reported to Obama that U.S. efforts in Afghanistan would fail if 40,000 additional troops were not deployed there. McChrystal’s experience as the commander of the military’s clandestine service has given him expert insight into how insurgencies operate—this background adds additional legitimacy to his request, which the President must take very seriously.
President Obama is reported to be near a decision on troop reinforcements. Yet reports indicate that the plan could be considered “McChrystal light,” wordplay on the popular drink, because the amount of troops that may ultimately reach Afghanistan will most likely fall short of the general’s request. Troops will most likely begin arriving in Afghanistan in January, leaving the troops on the ground with several months of unassisted operations. Any operation will result in failure if not provided with adequate manpower, and nowhere is this more apparent than in military operations.
Prior to the troops arriving, significant clandestine operations should be launched in an effort to locate and target key areas in which the Taliban have footholds. Additional outposts can be made in the contested regions to solidify the rule of law within the country.
Specifically, a significant amount of troop reinforcements must be sent to the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. The Northern Pakistan region has become a safe haven for insurgents, allowing for a crisscrossing of men and supplies. The porous border exacerbates the problems caused by insurgents in Afghanistan and adds to the peacekeeping woes of nearby Pakistan.
Many of the outposts along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border have few troops. In an October attack on one outpost defended by 48 Americans and half as many Afghan soldiers, insurgent forces outnumbered those troops three to one. The American and Afghan forces were only able to defend themselves thanks to the technological superiority of their weaponry and support, as air strikes and helicopters were rushed to defend the outpost. The attack highlighted the strategic issue of spreading forces dangerously thin. The incoming troops Obama must make available should give more priority to these border outposts, ensuring that such skin-of-the-teeth defenses can be avoided.
A recent victory by Afghanistan and international troops in northern Afghanistan provides further reason to take heart. A large force of Afghan troops and 50 international soldiers engaged Taliban forces in Chahar Dara district of Kunduz province and killed over 100 Taliban fighters, including eight commanders. With Afghanistan forces making progress in successfully confronting insurgents, the addition of American troops will help train and support other Afghan-led operations. With the combination of more Afghan and American troops, the ability for troops to secure vital areas will increase. In addition, the Afghan troop progress in engaging insurgents is heartening for the long term security of Afghanistan.
The American people may worry that more American troops will slow the ability of Afghan troops to take up their own national security. However, with the recent engagement between insurgents and Afghan troops, it is clear that those native forces are increasingly effective. American forces will help coordinate those efforts, not limit them.
Those opposing the troop increase often cite the recent questionable election in Afghanistan as a reason why more troops should not be sent. They feel that the additional troops will alienate the Afghan people when Afghans are concerned by possible fraud in the election. The success of democracy in Afghanistan is without a doubt part of the American mission in the country; however, the goal of isolating and destroying insurgents should be separated from election objectives. It is logical to send in troops to fight insurgents even as the Afghan people resolve their election crisis.
Both American missions in Afghanistan—aiding it in becoming a flourishing democracy while isolating and destroying insurgents—are achievable. The troop reinforcements will aid both aims by helping to provide security for the Afghan people and taking the fight to the insurgents. The American people can rest assured that the additional troops Obama must send in will undoubtedly be beneficial to U.S. missions in Afghanistan. The war in Afghanistan is one that can and will be won, if the Obama administration makes the right call on troop levels.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: Andrea Bocelli, Anish Kapoor, and the Pope walk into the Sistine Chapel...
But this is no joke. On Saturday, the Vatican invited 250 of the art world’s Very Important People to its digs in the Holy See for a little face-time with Benedict XVI. The aforementioned Bocelli and Kapoor, as well as Ennio Morricone, Arvo Pärt, and other literary and artistic luminaries, put in appearances. The general mood in the artist camp was one of awed reverence; the general dress code, black. Nobody wants to clash with the supreme leader of the Catholic church.
Were they right to feel so flattered? In theory, the Vatican’s decision to extend the olive branch to the arts apparatchik couldn’t have been more admirable. Interactions between those who peg themselves as God’s messengers, and those more inclined to say with Diego Rivera that “I’ve never believed in God, but I believe in Picasso,” have historically been not-quite-ideal—to put it mildly. (Remember the Inquisition?) Benedict himself picked up on this, drawing on the language of motivational management literature to emphasize the need for “re-establishing a dialogue,” and inviting artists to inject their work with a renewed dose of spirituality.
It became clear relatively quickly, however, that the presumable motive for the meeting—a discussion of how best to “communicate beauty”—masked an exercise in negative aesthetics. No tourist will ever mistake the Vatican for the MoMA; the church’s vision for a new art seems mostly to be an art that won’t offend said church.
Benedict certainly didn’t self-censor as he condemned contemporary artistic representations of beauty as “illusory and deceitful.” He went on to argue that such art “imprisons man within himself and further enslaves him, depriving him of hope and joy.” (Tough words for those of us who didn’t know we were enslaved in the first place: could the papal library stock Weber and Nietzsche?) The spleen was perhaps only to be expected from a bishop who, prior to donning the mitre, frequently provoked the press barb “God’s Rottweiler.”
The precise victim of his vitriol, though, remained exasperatingly ambiguous. The Vatican has engaged in fairly frequent shake-ups with thriller writer Dan Brown, including last year’s totally straight-faced denunciation of “The Da Vinci Code” as an “offense against God.” (The spats tend to come off as amusing largely because the church takes him far more seriously than the rest of the world does.) Yet it’s hard to imagine Brown—or previous bête noire J.K. Rowling—creating a work of such potency as to produce the existential symptoms the Pope fears.
The question of whether such a work exists at all is a valid one. If it does, the church has remained mum. As insistent as it is on passing judgment, the Vatican remains troublingly resistant to singling out any genuinely serious modern art or literature to criticize. Hand-waving vaguely at “contemporary representations of beauty,” or straw-manning Ron and Harry, is far easier than starting a real debate about what role religion can play in the arts. So far, the church’s reaction to complex—if provocative—creative products like Martin Scorsese’s “The Last Temptation of Christ” has generally been one of recoil; works of art that don’t aim to provoke have elicited no comment at all.
Even if it had taken aim at any truly idea-rich art, the church would do well to be wary. Nearly every time the clergy has tried to peg something as “illusory and deceitful” in the past, it’s been forced to engage in copious backtracking—picking out “good art” is always something of a dice toss. For proof, the Pope would simply have had to look up. Michelangelo’s altar fresco “The Last Judgment,” a fundamental background work in any study of western art history, loomed over Saturday’s proceedings as the literal backdrop for Benedict’s welcoming speech. Yet during the heady days of mid-17th century Italy, around the same time that Galileo had his feet held to the fire for his dangerously newfangled Copernican views, Michelangelo was accused of creating work more fit for a public bath than a place of worship. One artist was even hired to paint a loincloth over the offending genitalia.
Perhaps that’s what’s worth keeping in mind: that the distance from olive branch to fig leaf is only yea big. Aiming deliberately for spirituality or beauty may be missing the point. Often, it’s actually the most “sacrilegious,” boundary-testing works that most stretch thinking—and ultimately strengthen belief. In some sense, Benedict’s get-together did acknowledge this; if art can “enslave” us, it can also save us. (The Pope even floated the idea of a booth at the Venice Biennale next year: one can only wonder the contents of the goody bags he’d pass out.) But it takes a startling lack of faith to argue that contemporary creative acts are isolating and worthless simply because they don’t contain the overt moral messages that scan with the church’s higher-ups.
At any rate, given a raucous three-hour bus ride to New Haven, sleepless night of party-hopping, and booze-fueled all-day tailgate at The Game, it’s safe to say that piety wasn’t at the forefront of the typical Harvard student’s mind this Saturday. Thousands of miles away in Vatican City, the Pope’s gesture may have superficially seemed like a gesture of aisle-crossing good will—but, in its own way, it was just as profane.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week’s close Undergraduate Council election ended with a bang: The Election Commission voted to decertify the results, prompting half of the EC to resign in protest, and the UC President’s email account sent a message accusing Vice Presidential candidate Eric Hysen of fraud—signed by Vice President Kia McLeod—but no one admits to drafting it.
The debate centers on the computer system that tallied the votes, and whether anyone tampered with election results. Electronic voting systems have their advantages in cost, accessibility, and, precision. But last week’s events illustrate that machines are more likely to sink an election than to save it, in part because electronic voting often generates the perception of unfairness, even if everything is played by the book.
Before computers, voters simply had to accept imprecision. In ancient Athens, votes were decided by a show of hands, counted informally. For the framers of the United States Constitution, the Electoral College meant that your vote didn’t really matter that much anyway. In theory, electronic voting systems are a huge improvement because they can count with far greater precision than humans. An computerized system should be able to verify the voter’s identity, count the votes in real time, and yet still leave no record that would allow a person to sell his or her vote.
But even the most sophisticated voting machine can only making voting more precise, not more just. They can’t force certain demographics to turn out to vote in higher numbers or undo the name-recognition advantage incumbents enjoy. Nothing can stop a candidate from changing his last name to “Aardvark” so that he’ll be listed higher on a crowded primary ballot. While there may be no technological solution to combat many of these concerns, sophisticated statistical methods could resolve some of these issues. For instance, computers could randomize the order of the candidates’ names to get around the precedence advantage.
Yet modern voting systems don’t rely on statistics to smooth out voting irregularities, in large part because statistics make people uncomfortable. Statistical methodology throws into doubt the “one man, one vote” assumption and leaves the door wide open to allegations of fraud. For example, statistical sampling was almost banned in the 2000 census, and in debates over the 2010 census this summer, Republicans were vocal in their critique of statistical methods. In the words of Rep. Paul Broun, there is a real fear that “every voter will not be counted and maybe some voters might be counted more often than others.” One could only imagine the outcry if these techniques were applied to a national election.
Often, changes that make an election technically fairer paradoxically give it the appearance of somehow being rigged. Mathematical wizardry can look like real wizardry to the uninitiated. Therefore, scientific assessment of fairness matters much less than the public’s perception of it.
One reason why the UC election proved so contentious was because the vote-counting system itself altered perceptions of the race. The UC election uses the Hare-Clark single transferable vote system, which means votes for losing candidates get redistributed to the top tickets. The system is more sophisticated (and ultimately fairer) than the simple plurality vote we use for the American presidency. But it also means that the vote counting takes place in multiple rounds where tallies rise and fall and early advantages often disappear. The Hayward campaign was winning until the third-place votes were redistributed, and this may have contributed to a sense that victory was taken away from them.
Election officials were also confused about how the software worked, and the email bearing the VP’s signature implied that Hysen’s ability to access the database meant he could also change the results unnoticed. Although there appears to be no evidence of tampering, the suspicion will be tough to dispel.
Yet, just because no fraud seemed to occurr doesn’t make it impossible. No networked system can be fully secure, and modern computers are running so much code written by so many people that a backdoor could exist at any level. Even without malicious attacks, tabulation systems that employ sophisticated verification mechanisms can behave in mysterious ways, which compounds the general problem in computing that no one can fully trust code they did not author.
The failings of electronic voting in the U.S. are well documented: lost absentee ballots, servers freezing in Ohio, and deleted votes in the 2008 election. The scariest part is that with no permanent record of voting input due to secret balloting, we may never know if an election has been compromised.
If electronic voting not only generates undue suspicion, as in the UC case, but is actually more susceptible to fraud as well, then there is ample reason to remove the machines where the election really matters. It may be more expensive and more difficult, but, to paraphrase the Long-Johnson campaign, at least we can get behind it.

Five Harvard undergraduates have been chosen for the Rhodes scholarship this year, compared to only two students the last two years.
The five Harvard College Scholars are Darryl W. Finkton Jr. ’10 from Indiana, Eva Z. Lam ’10 from Wisconsin, Roxanne E. Bras ’09 from Florida, Jean A. Junior ’09 from Michigan, and  Grace Tiao ’08 from Georgia.
The Rhodes scholarship rewards 32 students in the United States with an all-expenses paid academic experience at the University of Oxford in England. Each student is able to study for two to three years in a postgraduate program of his or her choice.
According to the Rhodes Trust Web site, the criteria used for selecting Scholars are “literary and scholastic attainments, energy to use one’s talents to the full, truth, courage, devotion to duty, sympathy for and protection of the weak, kindliness, unselfishness and fellowship, moral force of character and instincts to lead, and to take an interest in one’s fellow beings.”
Each of the five Scholars suggested that the high number of Harvard students that were selected was the result of the support he or she received from the University.
“Our fellowship advisor is absolutely incredible and knows everything about everything,” said Lam. “She gave us an incredible mock interview that was excruciating but helpful. I have never had access to that level of advising before in my life.”
“I figured it wasn’t very realistic that I would win,” Finkton said. “But I talked about it with my advisor and decided to apply.”
The students selected have a variety of interests and plans of study. Finkton, a neurobiology concentrator in Quincy House, plans to use the scholarship to receive a Masters in Global Health and an MBA from the business school, spending part of his time doing development work in Africa.
“After that, the plan is to go to medical school and focus on international medicine and community development,” Finkton said.
Bras, who was an economics concentrator in Pforzheimer house last year and currently works as an active duty lieutenant, plans to earn an M.Phil. in international relations before returning to the army in the United States.
Lam of Leverett House said she will earn two masters degrees during her time at Oxford, one in comparative and international education and the other in comparative social policy. A social studies concentrator, Lam plans to return to the United States and teach for some time.
After graduating with a degree in English and history of science, Tiao has worked as an environmental scientist, leading a biodiversity expedition to Antarctica in 2008-2009. At Oxford, she plans to get a B.A. in mathematics and statistics.
A sociology concentrator and pre-med who graduated from Lowell House, Junior intends to study comparative social policy before returning to the United States for medical school.
“I want to use the degree to address not just patient’s clinical problems but also their socioeconomic needs. And I want to do that through policy change and delivery services,” said Junior. “I want to work in whatever organization I feel I will have the most impact in.”
CORRECTION
An earlier version of the Nov. 23 news article "Rhodes Recipients Named" incorrectly stated that Jean A. Junior ’09 graduated from Leverett House. In fact, Junior lived in Lowell House.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Greta M. Solinap ’13 was applying to Harvard last fall, she asked her classmate’s older sister, Diana C. Robles ’10, for advice. They had overlapped for a year at Nogales High School in Nogales, Ariz. and had kept in touch sporadically since then, but Solinap did not know Robles was the Mexican-American coordinator for Harvard’s Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program.
Solinap says Robles helped her decide on a topic for her personal statement and gave her general application advice.
Though this time she was helping a friend, it was also all in a day’s work for Robles.
“I gave her advice that I would give anyone who would call the UMRP,” says Robles, who is also a senior coordinator for the program.
GETTING THE WORD OUT
The UMRP, a program associated with the Admissions Office, serves as a resource to minority prospective students. With two student coordinators in each of five categories—African American, Asian American, Latino/Latina, Mexican American, and Native American—the UMRP answers questions about Harvard, the application process, and financial aid.
UMRP also sends students to do recruiting in their local high schools and middle schools. Robles says she used her freshman year trip to visit schools that had not been contacted before. She spent her spring break driving across Arizona to visit fifteen high schools, six more than the average number of stops.
The UMRP usually sends students for winter break and spring break, but the calendar change means there won’t be winter break trips this year.
UMRP Director Roger Banks says the program usually plans hometown recruiting trips between Thanksgiving and Christmas. But Banks says they did not want to plan the trips during final exams period this year. He adds that the UMRP will reconsider bringing back the winter break trips in the future.
Though budget cuts have affected the ten coordinators’ term-time wages, Banks says the program will continue to pay for students’ transportation home for the spring break recruiting.
During the school year, the ten coordinators log six hours a week answering e-mails and phone calls, giving tours and information sessions, and finding hosts for visiting prospective students.
Since Ronnye C. Rutledge ’12 started working as an African American Coordinator this year, she has shared her experience at Harvard and dispelled misconceptions about Harvard life, students’ socioeconomic status, and elitism on campus.
“I’m able to say from my own experience coming from modest means I have felt in no way hindered by my racial identity or economic status,” she says.
Similarly, Co-Coordinator for the Latino Division Lucerito L. Ortiz ’10 says that many of the calls she deals with are from prospective students wondering what it is like to be a minority at Harvard and if there is a sense of community.
FIELDING QUESTIONS
Ortiz, who is also one of two senior coordinators, says many students also ask what their chances are of getting in. “We just speak about our personal experience and tell them we’re not admissions officers, that we can’t gauge, but we always encourage them to apply,” she says.
One of the most difficult parts of the job for Karen S. Johnson ’11, the other African American coordinator, is speaking with students who weren’t admitted and want to know why.
“It’s just hard because it’s a process and I don’t know what the deciding factor was,” she says.“You have to make them aware that [...] it’s not that they weren’t a good candidate but they weren’t chosen.”
Though the majority of the queries the UMRP receives are admissions questions from prospective students and their parents, they also get their share of surprising calls. These range from parents wanting to know how to get their 7-year-old admitted to people in their seventies who dream of getting a degree from Harvard.
NOT JUST WORD OF MOUTH
The UMRP was founded in 1972 when the college was interested in increasing the number of minority students. According to Banks, 40 years ago the recruitment process was based on word of mouth, which accounted for the homogeneous student body.
“It was very informal, either through a coach, teacher, family member, or someone who was already part of Harvard,” he says. “There was not a lot of outreach.”He adds, “Colleges of this kind took a long glance in the mirror and figured this is really not representative of what the country could be.”
To change this, the College decided to involve its students in getting the word out about Harvard’s accessibility. The message resonated with Solinap.
“I always had a dream of applying to Harvard, but seeing someone from my own high school and my hometown do it motivated me to think I could do it too,” she says.
Inspired by her friend’s help, Solinap now acts as a resource to others through the UMRP. She works as Co-Coordinator for the Mexican American division alongside Robles.

With a roasted pig’s head from the Porcellian Club tailgate facing her, Alyssa N. Hill ’11, with a plateful of that same swine’s meat in-hand, said, “I’m not really that interested in going to the game.”
Indeed, for many Harvard and Yale students, Saturday’s football game was just an excuse for tailgating.
Yale’s less restrictive rules allowed for kegs at the tailgates, which were not required to shut down until the third quarter.
Last year, the Boston Police began enforcing stricter alcohol policies at the Harvard-hosted Game, irking many students and dampening festivities. Tailgates were required to end by kickoff, and kegs were prohibited.
“I love Harvard to death but Yale’s tailgate rules are amazing. This is the way a tailgate should be,” Sam W.K. Bonsey ’10 said. “It’s the greatest experience of my life.”
Each of Harvard’s 12 houses was allotted a space just 100 yards from some of the Yale tailgates, and many houses used this as an opportunity to display their creativity.
While Pforzheimer wooed students with buckets of steaming chili and cowbells, Mather House stole the show by sporting a 25-foot fabric Mather tower look-alike, which was held up by three helium balloons.
On the ground, students ate burgers in front of the Mather table, waiting for “Crunk Time.” Every fifteen minutes, students drank to the sounds of whistles and screams as the minute hand of the “Crunk Clock” reached Crunk Time. Although Crunk Time only occurred in fifteen minute intervals, students kept drinking throughout the morning.
“We push the hands forward,” said Julia E. Cain ’11, who helped organize the Mather tailgate.
Students freely walked through the parking lot holding bottles of André, handles of tequila, and cans of beer.
“I have never seen this many people this drunk, this early in the morning,” Steven W. Talbot ’13 said.
The bells and whistles of Mather house may have attracted quite a crowd but other houses sought to impress their clientele through more traditional means.
“We don’t have a giant cloth tower, but we wouldn’t want that kind of scar on Winthrop,” said Frank A. Myslicki ’12, a member of Winthrop HoCo, which served burgers and beer.At Eliot’s tailgate, things were slightly more formal.
“We have champagne. We do mimosas. We like to keep it classy,” said Eliot HoCo member Brett M. Giblin ’11. “It’s a reflection of our houses and our lives.”
About 100 yards from the sea of Crimson, members of Yale’s 12 colleges and various clubs had their own tailgate, incidentally located near the only source of music, a large set of speakers blasting everything from Miley Cyrus’ “Party in the USA” to Lil Jon’s “Shots.”
Not surprisingly, some Elis thought that their side of the tailgate was superior to Harvard’s.
“Practice makes perfect,” said Yale student Andrew A. Eberle, clearly jabbing at Harvard’s perceived lack of school spirt and game attendance. “We’re out here for every home game. It makes everything go a lot smoother.”
The Yale heavyweight crew team received a large round of applause from the crowd as its members returned to the Yale side of the parking lot with an inflatable palm tree it stole from the Mather tailgate.
“I just grabbed it and ran,” freshman Tom Lynam said. “Nobody said anything.”
As the clock neared game time, the enthusiasm was tangible. By the time the game reached the end of the first half, however, the kegs began to go dry, the ground became littered with discarded solo cups, and students started to make their way across the street to the Yale Bowl.
Though messy, the event never truly got out of hand.
“It’s pretty tame,” said Sergeant Jay Jones from the Yale University Police Department, adding, “It’s Ivy League.”

CORRECTION APPENDED
After a two and a half hour Undergraduate Council Executive Board meeting yesterday, there is still no UC president-elect. But a vote that could make John F. Bowman ’11 the next Council president is set to take place at today’s UC General meeting.
During yesterday’s meeting, Council members worked to put an end to the confusion and to understand why the seven person Election Commission—just minutes away from announcing the next Council president—voted to decertify election results Thursday night out of fear of voting irregularities.
Four EC members, as well as one of the three EC members who resigned last Thursday, attended last night’s public meeting and fielded pointed questions about the decision.
EC member Phillip J. Morris ’12 clarified the majority’s decision, explaining that after speaking with Brad A. Seiler ’10, the EC chair who resigned early Friday morning in protest of the decertification vote, Morris said he thought it was possible that election results had been tampered with.
“I remember asking the question ‘Can we certify 100 percent that no one has tampered with the election,’” said EC member Dennis M. Mwaura ’12. “And Brad said ‘No, we can never be 100 percent sure.’”
The three EC members who were present agreed they did not have any reason to believe votes had been changed but thought that since only Seiler had been able to monitor voting at the time and that no records existed that would allow EC members to review the process, there was no way of knowing if the results were tampered with.
“I’m from Kenya, I know what forged elections mean,” said Mwaura.
Besides Seiler, a Computer Science concentrator who has worked at Google, none of the remaining UC members considered themselves particularly knowledgeable about electronic vote tampering.
FAS IT may be able to provide more definitive information about whether anyone accessed the voting software inappropriately soon, according to Assistant Dean of Harvard College for Student Life Susan Marine, who attended yesterday’s Executive Board meeting and said that Jay Carter, FAS IT’s director of information security, would search for signs of improper access today.
At the end of yesterday’s Executive Board meeting, members unanimously agreed to put forward legislation during today’s UC General meeting that would allow the UC to certify the election—a power previously reserved for the Executive Board, which consists of the President, Vice President, UC committee chairs, and other Council officers.
Besides the fact-finding portion of the meeting, the Executive Board also discussed their reactions to Thursday night’s controversial e-mail, which was signed by UC Vice President Kia J. McLeod ’10 and implied that Vice Presidential Candidate Eric N. Hysen ’11 could have been involved in voting fraud.
Hysen categorically denied the accusations and supporters of both major UC tickets came to his defense.
McLeod, who was present for the first portion of the meeting and is a member of the Executive Board, left the meeting minutes before her e-mail was discussed—much to the consternation of many present.
Daniel V. Kroop ’10, who worked on the campaign to elect the current President Andrea R. Flores ’10 and McLeod, called it “incredibly disappointing” that she left the meeting.
McLeod’s running mate had similarly harsh words.
“What Kia did does not represent the vision of leadership for the Council,” Flores said of the e-mail.
McLeod denied writing the controversial message in an interview with The Crimson early Friday morning.
But according to former Student Affairs Committee Chair Tamar Holoshitz ’10, who said she contributed to the e-mail, McLeod approved its contents and sent it from the official UC presidential e-mail account.
Legislation will be presented at today’s UC General meeting calling for McLeod’s impeachment on charges related to improper use of the UC president’s official e-mail account.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week Harvard Medical School Dean Jeffrey S. Flier gave the debate over health care reform a “failing grade.” In a Wall Street Journal editorial, Flier criticized the nature of the debate, the economic logic of the spending plan, the efficacy of proposed legislation, and the plan’s transparency.
“I wanted to express my personal opinions to stimulate a more vigorous discussion of the issues,” Flier wrote in an e-mailed statement.
“Informed debate should characterize a community such as [Harvard], where we have leaders in the field of health policy at many schools where innumerable individuals are contributing scholarship and opinions on every aspect of this discussion,” Flier wrote.
Flier, an endocrinologist and researcher, began his article by criticizing the nature of Congressional healthcare debates.
“Those of us for whom the central issue is health—not politics—have been left in the lurch,” he wrote.
For Flier, the proposed legislation does not do enough to solve the underlying issues of the healthcare system and focuses too much on reducing the number of uninsured.
Flier’s editorial was published on Nov. 17, the day before Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev) introduced his version of the overhauling healthcare legislation, a plan with an $848 billion price tag.
The need for innovation and research in healthcare reform has been echoed by prominent economists, according to Alan M. Garber ’77, director of Stanford’s Center for Health Policy.
Garber co-wrote a letter to President Barack Obama about controlling cost in healthcare. The letter was signed by 20 economists, including two Nobel Laureates, Kenneth J. Arrow and Daniel L. McFadden. A third Nobel Laureate, William F. Sharpe, asked for his name to be added to the list of signers.
“There is a growing consensus that such research should study better ways to deliver health care and to design health insurance,” Garber wrote in an e-mailed statement. “There is a controversy about whether the legislative proposals go far enough to control costs or to promote innovation.”
Garber did not take as harsh a view as Flier did on the state of the national healthcare debate.
“I’d give [the health reform effort] an incomplete [grade],” Garber said. “Whether it is fiscally responsible must be judged in the context of other federal activity, such as other legislation directed at Medicare revenues and payments.”
“So that incomplete grade may remain for a very long time,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Tuesday, the Massachusetts State Senate held a hearing on a proposed bill which would permit local municipalities to set aside preferred parking spaces for eco-friendly vehicles. Under the bill, local cities and towns would have the option of creating spots specifically for low-to-zero emissions vehicles like hybrids.
The bill, which has been considered in committee on several occasions prior to Tuesday’s hearing, would amend the current law on emissions standards set up by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection by adding a new paragraph stipulating that “any city or town...may further regulate the parking of vehicles by restricting certain areas...for the parking of any vehicle bearing a distinctive plate identifying such vehicle as a low emissions vehicle.”
The bill, petitioned by Senators John A. Hart, Jr. and Sonia Chang-Diaz, also specified that the penalty for violating preferred parking spaces would be a fine between $15 and $50.
The office of Chang-Diaz said that this bill would not lead to a state-wide mandate for preferred parking spaces. Rather, it would provide city and town municipalities the option of creating preferred parking spaces if they see the need. Costs for implementing the program would fall to the municipality setting them up.
“It would all depend on the way the local town would adopt this legislation,” said Nathan T. Pham, policy director for the office of Senator Hart. “If no city and town adopts the legislation, then it won’t have any impact.”
Metropolitan cities like Boston may potentially not feel the impact at all if the bill were passed, he said.
“That’s not something we foresee happening here in Boston,” said Pham, referring to whether the city of Boston would ever consider setting aside these preferred parking spots.
According to Susan E. Clippinger, director of traffic, parking and transportation for the city of Cambridge, the bill would have minimal to no impact on parking and transportation in the city.
“We’re trying to get people not to drive, at all, any vehicle,” said Clippinger. “I’m not sure this would encourage people to buy different vehicles. It certainly isn’t something that would encourage people to drive less.”
Clippinger said that the city of Cambridge has been taking measures to increase the number of commuters using bicycles and public transportation.
“In the last six years, we’ve seen a one-hundred percent increase in the number of people bicycling,” said Clippinger. “We’re seeing increased MBTA ridership at T-stations that serve Cambridge.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CORRECTION APPENDED
At 10 p.m. last Thursday evening, the Undergraduate Council Election Commission convened in the dark at the steps of Widener library to engage in the annual rite of marching to the headquarters of the winning ticket and announcing the results.
For appearance’s sake, all was as it usually was. Voting had closed at noon that day, and the results had been certified by an oral vote of five of the seven-member Commission—which oversees the elections each year—six hours later. But after a few minutes of squabbling, Commission Chair Brad A. Seiler ’10 relocated the gathering to the Science Center for an impromptu meeting.
By midnight, Seiler and two other Commission members had abruptly resigned their posts, an e-mail to the Undergraduate Council open list (UC General) signed by the UC Vice President questioned the validity of the voting results and suggested possible vote tampering, and the presidential ticket of John F. Bowman ‘11 and Eric N. Hysen ’11, celebrating in its Pforzheimer belltower headquarters after the Crimson Web site erroneously announced their victory, had to be told that things were far from decided.
Three days after the ending of the closest Undergraduate Council presidential election in recent history, while the student body’s chief governing organization finalizes plans to pass judgment on vote tallies that remain decertified today, a series of interviews by The Crimson shed some light on the events that led to Friday’s confused outcome and the questions that may define the discourse on what remains to be done.
The picture that emerges is of a battle for the soul of an election that extends well beyond the candidates themselves, encompassing several former Council members—one of them now graduated—the current leadership, and the Commission itself.
On Tuesday, Nov. 10, former Student Affairs Committee Chair Tamar Holoshitz ’10 had an Internet chat with former UC Vice President Randall S. Sarafa ’09, in which he told Holoshitz that VP candidate Hysen, the technical director for the UC, had the passwords to access the voting software.
Holoshitz wrote to Seiler on Nov. 15, a day before voting opened, inquiring about the EC’s efforts to ensure that the software was monitored by others besides himself.
Seiler responded that he would bring the issue to the EC to decide.
On the same Sunday, Seiler wrote to both Hysen and current UC President Andrea R. Flores ’10 informing them that their access to the ucvote.web service had been revoked.
In later e-mails on Nov. 16, Seiler informed Holoshitz that it had been decided at an EC meeting earlier that day that all Commissioners would receive access to the voting software, and that he was at the time the only one who could access the voting software. But commissioners did not receive access to the software until Thursday after the election.
Holoshitz forwarded her e-mail, and Seiler’s subsequent responses, to both current UC Vice President Kia J. McLeod ’10 and former UC presidential candidate Benjamin P. Schwartz ’10, who lost in a bitter race against Flores last year. In these e-mails, she discussed with Schwartz the possibility of feeding a story about the voting software to a Crimson reporter.
Voting opened to the student body at noon on Nov. 16.
According to EC member Phillip Morris ’12, Seiler brought up at the EC meeting the following day—Monday—the possibility of a technological loophole that could allow outside parties to access the voting software.
There are two ways that a user could theoretically access the voting results, Seiler said in an interview with The Crimson last week. One requires the user to go through the administrative interface on the UC Web site, an access method that Seiler claimed remained only to him after Hysen and Flores’ access were removed on Nov. 15.
The second is through direct access to the MySQL database that holds raw voter data. Seiler said that it would be possible to modify the votes in this way, explaining that as far as he knew, only he and Hysen had access to the database.
On Tuesday, Nov. 17—after approximately 2,200 votes had been cast, according to Morris—Seiler, a computer science concentrator who worked at Google last summer, wrote a logging program from his own personal FAS account to address the database “vulnerability,” which Seiler said had existed since the system was first designed. The program he wrote would notify him anytime anyone accessed the MySQL database on which the votes were stored, he said.
Around 10 a.m. on Thursday, Flores tried to log into ucpres@gmail.com, an account for which only she, Vice President McLeod, and Student Relations Committee Chair Daniel V. Kroop ’10 knew the password. The account sends e-mails on the behalf of the Council president with the listed address of ucpres@fas.harvard.edu, Flores said.
Both McLeod and Kroop denied knowing anything about the password change, Flores said, though The Crimson obtained an e-mail yesterday forwarded by McLeod to several parties, including Schwartz, Holoshitz and presidential candidate George J. J.  Hayward ’11 early Thursday afternoon in which Flores asked for the password.
“[H]a jokes! HAHAHA...should I change it back?” reads McLeod’s comment on the e-mail.
At noon on Thursday, online voting for the presidential elections closed.
At 5:30 Thursday afternoon, 5 members of the Election Commission—Seiler, Dennis  M. Mwaura ’12, Emily E. Osborne ’12, Daniel P. Robinson ’10, and Sanyee Yuan ’12—met to certify the results.
Seiler showed the four other members the voting results, which indicated a Bowman-Hysen victory, as tallied by the voting software.
Seiler then took an oral vote to certify the results. According to Osborne, one of the EC members who later resigned, there were no voices of dissent at the time, resulting in a successful certification.
But a few hours later, Yuan learned about the technological loophole that Seiler addressed Monday—a  meeting that she did not attend—and became concerned about whether the election had been “free and fair.”
According to Yuan, her requests to Seiler to reconsider the certification of the results were originally rebuffed.
At 8:15 p.m. that evening, Morris met Yuan in Quincy House after the conclusion of the UC Student Initiatives Committee meeting, chaired by Mallika Khandelwal ’11. After discussing their concerns about the voting process and Seiler’s leadership, the two commissioners approached Khandelwal, a known supporter of the presidential campaign of Hayward and Felix M. Zhang ’11, with their worries.
Morris said that Khandelwal encouraged the two to talk to other commissioners, and then informed McLeod of the situation.
10 p.m. found the EC discussing Morris and Yuan’s concerns on the steps of Widener Library, when Seiler called the emergency meeting in the Science Center.
At approximately 10:45 p.m., Seiler, Osborne, and Robinson returned to Widener. Seiler notified The Crimson that they had voted to decertify the election results.
The small crowd that had been awaiting their return—which included Khandelwal, UC representatives Daniel P. Bicknell ’13 and David Gonzalez ’11, and for short periods of time McLeod, Holoshitz, and Schwartz—dispersed shortly afterwards.
Around 11 p.m., Student Initiatives Committee Chair Khandelwal and Bicknell went to the Quincy House dining hall to do homework, according to Bicknell.
He said that he accompanied Khandelwal to the Spindell private dining room at the back of Quincy dining hall, where he saw Holoshitz, McLeod, and Schwartz writing on a laptop. Schwartz had encouraged a Crimson reporter an hour earlier to come to Quincy House, texting first “Just come” and then “Scandal.”
Both Holoshitz and Schwartz are registered members of the Hayward-Zhang campaign staff, the primary ticket opposing Bowman-Hysen. McLeod sent e-mails and texts in support of the ticket last week.
According to Bicknell, Schwartz requested that he leave the room, at which point he returned to the main dining hall, though Khandelwal remained in the room.
Bicknell said Holoshitz came out of the room shortly afterwards to tell him and Gonzalez, who had just arrived, not to tell anyone that she, McLeod, and Schwartz were in the Spindell room.
Around 11:30, Bicknell said Khandelwal came out of the room, saying that Holoshitz, McLeod, and Schwartz were drafting an e-mail which she had told McLeod not to send.
At 11:36 p.m., an e-mail sent from ucpres@fas.harvard.edu with the subject line “A Message on the Election from UC Vice-President Kia McLeod” was sent over the UC-general e-mail list. The message implied that, among other charges, vice presidential candidate Hysen may have had access to—and even tampered with—students’ votes in the election.
According to Bicknell, Khandelwal, followed by Kroop, re-entered the room after the first e-mail and encouraged McLeod to send out a retraction.
Khandelwal could not be reached for comment last night. Schwartz, when asked to comment on his involvement last night, responded only via text, writing that the claims were “sheer political maneuvering to distract from the improprieties of the election.”
At 12:27 a.m., an e-mail from McLeod’s personal FAS account was sent with the subject line “PLEASE READ: Retraction of UC-Presidential Email.”
“I would like it to be known that I did not draft [the previous e-mail],” she wrote in the retraction.
McLeod told The Crimson in an interview soon after that she did not send the e-mail, and had no comment on who was responsible.
“It was an inappropriate use of Eric Hysen’s and my name, and it should be completely disregarded,” she said.
At around 3:30 in the morning on Friday, after McLeod’s retraction e-mail, Flores received an e-mail from McLeod with the new log-in information to the UC president e-mail account.
Upon re-entering the account, Flores found multiple drafts of the original message with McLeod’s signature.
CORRECTION
The original headline of the Nov. 23 news article "Fallout of UC Election Colored By Allegations of Misconduct, Internal Dissension, and Incriminating E-mails" incorrectly referred to e-mails sent alleging fraud in the UC election as "libelous." In fact, because libel is a legal standard that requires there to be a provably false statement of fact, the e-mails could not be deemed libelous.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW HAVEN, Conn.—There had been a few flashes of hope, but for the majority of the game, Harvard had been unable to finish. In one play, all of that changed.
On fourth and four midway through the fourth quarter, the Crimson, down 10-0 and back at its own 30, decided to go for it. After wasting its first two downs on incomplete passes and with the third good for only six yards, Harvard turned to junior tailback Gino Gordon—the team’s leading rusher for the past two seasons.
As he ran into a sea of Bulldogs, the Crimson’s hopes for a comeback seemed to be over.
But Gordon had other ideas, running to the left side of the field and using a spin move to break a tackle.
Suddenly the field was wide open, and Gordon kept running up the left sideline, making it to Harvard’s 49 before Geoff Dunham tripped him out of bounds.
“All of a sudden, we had new life,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said.
Two plays later, senior Matt Luft was in the endzone to make the score 10-7.
From then on, the Crimson had its way offensively with the Bulldogs, looking again like the Ivy power it has been for the last three seasons.
“[Gordon’s run] was a turning point in the game,” Yale coach Tom Williams said. “If we make that play, we feel like we could win the football game.”
GAMBLE GOES AWRY
At the end of the fourth quarter, Harvard’s defense had finally figured out Yale sophomore tailback Alex Thomas, as sophomore Sumner Webster and senior Ryan Barnes had thwarted his past two attempts. Yale was stuck at fourth and 22 on its own 25-yard line.
But waiting in the wings was Bulldog punter Tom Mante, the league’s leader who had averaged 51.3 yards per punt that day. With a long boot off Mante’s foot, Yale could push the Crimson far enough back that, with 2:25 left in the game, it would be difficult to make a winning drive.
Instead, the ball went to Bulldog safety John Powers.
“We thought that if we had executed that play and got the necessary yardage, the game was over,” Williams said.
The freshman found a pocket of space on the left side of the field, where he attacked the unsuspecting Crimson behind a wall of Bulldog blockers.
“You’re a genius if that play goes,” Murphy said.
But the distance was too long for the freshman, and Harvard junior defensive back Anthony Spadafino caught on, tackling Powers seven yards shy of the first down.
“If [the play did] not [work], [we thought] that we’d be able to run the clock out,” Williams said.
But shortly after taking over at Yale’s 40, junior quarterback Collier Winters found classmate Chris Lorditch for the winning touchdown.
“We were playing to win the football game,” Williams said. “We had set that play up all year, and we thought it was worth the 22 yards.”
RUSH WEEK
The Bulldogs entered Saturday’s matchup with the worst rushing offense in the league, averaging just 93.8 yards per game. But Harvard simply had no answer for Yale’s run game in the first three quarters.
“We knew we could run the ball on their defense,” said sophomore Alex Thomas, who had 124 yards. “We just gashed them.”
Thomas’ yardage marked the first time a Bulldog rushed for more than 100 yards since Mike McLeod ’09 ran for 138 last year against Princeton. Harvard, whose opponents averaged 82.7 rushing yards per game, seemed an unlikely victim of a breakout, but the sophomore fed off a strong performance by his offensive line.
“My job was easy: just follow their blocks,” Thomas said.
Given that Yale had amassed only 112 rushing yards against Princeton, it was understandably surprising when Thomas ran for 35 yards on Yale’s opening possession to set up a 26-yard field goal by junior Alex Barnes.
“They came out tough, and they had us on our heels for a long time,” Crimson captain Carl Ehrlich said. “We were just a little shocked.”
Also surprising was Rodney Reynolds’ three-yard touchdown run with 4:43 left in the first quarter. The senior tailback’s touchdown was the first of his career and Yale’s only one on Saturday. Reynolds’ previous action against Harvard had all come in JV games.
“He’s been through a lot of adversity in his career here at Yale,” Thomas said. “He’s never really had a real opportunity, and he’s really stepped it up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW HAVEN, Conn.—As you cross the state line from Massachusetts to Connecticut, a small sign reads, “Connecticut: We’re full of suprises.” Saturday, Harvard football brought more surprises to the Nutmeg State by pulling out 14 points against Yale in the last seven minutes of The Game.
The end result served as an apt analogy to a season in which the Crimson looked to new names to win games.
A distinctly different cast of characters from last year’s crew, Harvard finished with the same Ancient Eight win-loss record that it experienced last season—though Penn’s undefeated 2009 run in league play kept the Crimson from winning another Ivy title.
Throughout the season, there had been talk about Harvard being far from a perfect team, and most of that came from Crimson coach Tim Murphy himself.
“I’m still looking for that game where I come into this media conference and say, ‘We really played a perfect game,’” Murphy had said after the Columbia game two weeks ago. “We did what we had to do...the number one thing we do best is we play extremely hard.”
More than any other contest during the 2009 campaign, Saturday’s game against the Bulldogs was the epitome of that final statement.
Though the team played far from perfect, in the end, Harvard pulled out the win thanks to heroics from unlikely places.
For starters, senior Jon Takamura anchored the Crimson defense, which faltered early but played the stalwart card late in the game when it needed it most. He led the team in tackles with nine, and his interception with under a minute left in the game silenced a Yale comeback attempt.
Also bolstering the Harvard D was junior Josue Ortiz, who had to endure the game announced by the staidum PA as “joh-soo”—not “ho-sway,” as the Spanish pronunciation would dictate.
Ortiz, who has played in all 10 games this season despite being a starter in none of them, contributed seven tackles—sharing the lead with five solo tackles.
His big hit on Yale back Rodney Reynolds set the Bulldogs back two yards on a drive that culminated with a missed field goal attempt by Alex Barnes.
“We’re proud of the guys, especially our defensive line, stepping up in the fourth quarter,” Takamura said. “Just stopping the run and being physical, it’s what the coaches teach us. We didn’t execute well the first half, but definitely guys [stepped] up, and we were able to pull out the win.”
On the offensive side, the Crimson’s top wide receiver, senior Matt Luft, finally broke out of his season-long silent spell to corral a crucial 41-yard touchdown reception, moving the momentum safely into Harvard’s grasp.
“I’ve been saying all season, even though Matt hasn’t been [as] statistically great as he has been, that he was going to come up big for us, and he did today,” Winters said.
For a team that has consistently relied on answers from unlikely places, The Game was the fitting conclusion.
“[I’m] just very very proud of our kids and the resilience they showed,” Murphy said. “They think I’m a little bit corny at times, I even get that from my own children at home, but in the end it’s all about never give up...and that’s what happened out there today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Perseverance may have helped Harvard men’s soccer take the lead against the Monmouth Hawks, but the Crimson’s talent killed them off.
One scrappy goal—and two well-executed ones—handed 10th-seeded Harvard a 3-0 win over Monmouth (18-2-2) yesterday on Ohiri Field, moving the Crimson into next Sunday’s third round of the NCAA Tournament.
Despite the lopsided scoreline, the victory did not come easily.
“For the most part it was a 1-0 game, and a few moments of brilliance separated the game,” Harvard coach Jamie Clark said. “I thought that was the only difference between the two teams.”
The two vital plays came in the game’s final minutes.
With the Crimson (14-3-1) up 1-0 with 14 minutes left to play, sophomore Tim Linden won back possession on the left side of midfield. Linden played the ball up to the feet of co-captain Andre Akpan—recently named the Ivy League Player of the Year—who one-touched it back to freshman Scott Prozeller. The rookie then sent the ball through to freshman Brian Rogers, who was streaking down the left sideline. Rogers was brought down, but the ball fell into Akpan’s path, leading the referee to allow the advantage. Akpan ran at the Hawks defense before firing the ball into the back of the net with his left foot to double Harvard’s lead. The beautiful team goal was Akpan’s 47th of his career, moving him into first place on the Crimson’s all-time list, alongside Chris Ohiri ’64.
Eight minutes later, sophomore Jamie Rees was fouled a few yards outside the box. Senior Adam Rousmaniere curled the free kick around the wall and into the bottom right corner of the net to assure Harvard of a spot in the Tournament’s Sweet 16.
“[Rousmaniere] said ‘leave it, let me put it in,’” Akpan said. “And he did—he hit it perfectly right into the corner.”
The match was billed as a showdown between two of the nation’s best defenses, but in its final two tallies, the Crimson displayed its ability to create goals as well. Harvard’s potent attack will need to be on its game next week when the Crimson faces Maryland—the defending national champion—on Sunday.
With that game scheduled over Thanksgiving break, Harvard may have a tough time matching the 1,312 fans that were in attendance for the win over Monmouth. The Hawks brought a large contingent of their own to Cambridge, and the opposing sets of fans were going at each other for much of the game.
And the same could be said of the players on the field.
The early minutes of the game were absent of any significant scoring opportunities, but they did display a biting ferocity from both teams.
“It was two teams butting heads from the beginning,” Akpan said. “I’m pretty confident in the physicality of our team, and it showed today.”
Harvard may have been handed a better seed in the tournament, but Monmouth was ranked higher in the NSCAA/adidas National Rankings. The Hawks finished the season at No. 5, while the Crimson was No. 9.
And if results against common opponents were any indication of what was to come, Monmouth had to feel pretty good about its chances. The Hawks came into the game fresh off its first-round, penalty-shootout win over a UConn team that had crushed Harvard, 4-0, earlier in the year.
Monmouth also gained nonconference victories over Princeton and Cornell, whereas the Crimson fared much worse against those Ivy League rivals, losing and tying, respectively.
The physical nature of the match seemed to dictate play early, with neither team able to create chances.
“I actually thought Monmouth was a little bit sharper—maybe because they played the first game and had [any nervousness] out of their system,” Clark said. “But we settled after 15 minutes, and I think we started looking really good.”
Harvard started to take control as the half wore down, and in the 30th minute, it took the lead.
Rousmaniere took a Crimson corner on the left side, sending the ball into senior Kwaku Nyamekye at the far post. The All-Ivy First Team defender then headed back across goal to freshman Richard Smith, whose shot hit the crossbar. Junior midfielder Alex Chi—who was given an All-Ivy honorable mention this week—got in on the action, and his attempt looked to take a deflection before hitting the crossbar as well.
But Harvard was not to be denied in the goal-mouth scramble, as Smith popped up once again for his second goal of the season. The big defender is making a habit of scoring key goals for his team. The first tally of his career came last week in a 1-0 win against Penn and gave the Crimson the Ivy League title and a first-round bye in the Tournament.
“We do work a lot at set pieces, and I try to contribute as much as possible to the team,” Smith said.
“[Akpan and Smith] will win their share of stuff in the air, and then you add [Nyamekye] in there, and there aren’t many teams that can match it,” Clark said. “And then there’s a little bit of desire to pick up second balls and finish them.”
With its season on the line, the Hawks pushed hard for an equalizer in the second half. In the 67th minute, Monmouth stringed together a few good passes, but Anthony Vasquez’s back-post header cannoned off the crossbar.
In the 75th minute, Nyamekye came inches away from scoring off a header from a Harvard corner. But Hawks’ keeper Bryan Meredith pulled off a great save to keep Monmouth in the contest.
Unfortunately for the Hawks, a minute later, the Crimson put together the best move of the match to go up 2-0.
Rousmaniere’s free-kick goal in the 85th minute was the icing on the cake for Harvard, which will now have to turn its attention to Maryland.
In Sunday’s game against the Terrapins, Akpan will look to set the goalscoring record in what will likely be his final game on Ohiri Field. But his goal yesterday helped the Crimson reach the third round—something that Akpan had failed to do in his first three years at school—and the striker is focused solely on prolonging his collegiate career.
“Hopefully I can continue to score goals in my life, but this is my last chance to make it far in the Tournament, so that’s what I‘m looking for,” Akpan said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a tough, physical, and often violent night for the Harvard men’s hockey team (1-4-1, 1-4-1 ECAC) in its Friday home opener against St. Lawrence (7-4-1, 3-2-0 ECAC), one in which the Crimson came up short, falling 3-2 to the Saints.
In a game that saw a total of 14 penalties—including a 10-minute misconduct charge on St. Lawrence’s Mike McKenzie in the third period for instigating a fight that ended up with freshman forward Louis LeBlanc losing both his helmet and his footing—Harvard had plenty of man-advantage opportunities.
But the Crimson was only able to convert two of its six powerplay attempts and ultimately failed to establish a dynamic forecheck, settling instead for shooting from just beyond the blue line.
“We were able to generate some shots, but we need to be able to contribute on the power play and be able to win the special teams game,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We got two tonight, but we still don’t win the special teams game, and that ultimately could be the difference in the game.”
Harvard also gave up a number of penalties of its own.  In the first frame alone, the Crimson suffered four unanswered penalties and played two men down for almost a full minute.
Though Harvard survived the Saints’  five-on-three advantage, it couldn’t outlast St. Lawrence’s next powerplay opportunity.  About halfway into the frame, wide-open Saints freshman George Hughes scored his first collegiate goal with a powerful slapshot from the blue line.
“We gave them life out of the gate,”  Donato said.  “We left a window open for them to climb through by taking those penalties in the first period and not really controlling the play as much as we could have if we had remained five-on-five.”
But the tide changed in favor of the Crimson in the following frame, as St. Lawrence committed three consecutive errors of its own.
After a relatively even first period, Harvard went on the offensive during the final two frames, outshooting the Saints by 14, largely as a result of a flurry of St. Lawrence penalties.
Junior forward Michael Biega capitalized on one at 8:33 into the second, when he received the puck from junior forward Chris Huxley near the right point. Biega waited to skate through a narrow opening in the Saints defense and scored from close range.
“I think in the first powerplay goal, Michael Biega showed good patience,” Donato said.
But it wasn’t long before St. Lawrence regained the lead, scoring from point-blank range less than four minutes later on yet another powerplay goal. The Saints tallied the eventual game-winner at the start of the third for the night’s only even-strength goal, when Peter Child found the back of the net immediately off a faceoff on the left point, lifting the puck up and over junior goaltender Kyle Richter’s left shoulder to make it 3-1.
The Crimson fought back throughout the third, holding a 14-11 advantage in shots.
Just three minutes after Child’s tally and with 12:51 left on the clock, Saints netminder Alex Petizian twice came up big, as he first blocked Huxley’s one-timer at goal and again stopped the rebound from LeBlanc as the rookie came crashing through. The ensuing celebration from St. Lawrence—at the expense of LeBlanc—devolved into four-man pile-up and a total of four penalties were handed out as a result.
Sophomore forward Alex Killorn managed to pull one back for the Crimson with about 12 minutes left to play in the final frame, when he scored from a difficult angle on the right, wristing the puck across the face of goal and into the left side of the net.
Despite Harvard’s offensive intensity during the third, the Crimson was unable to put another past Petizian as the Saints’ defense blocked shot after shot.
“We just have to tighten up, and we have to be better, be more consistent throughout the game both offensively and defensively,” captain Alex Biega said. “Their goalie played well, but we have to really find that confidence and just get more shots on net and play a Harvard style of hockey.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team is off to its best start since 2005 after it improved to 3-0 with a victory over Bryant, 77-51, at Lavietes Pavilion Friday night.
Co-captain guard Jeremy Lin and freshman guard Christian Webster each had 12 points to lead a well-balanced attack by the Crimson, which started the game slowly but found a rhythm in the second half and never looked back. The Bulldogs fell to 0-4 with the loss.
“We were certainly pleased with the second half,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought it was a team effort by our group, and I thought we were able to wear them down.”
The first twenty minutes were a different story, as neither team was able to pull ahead in the frame. Sloppiness—including missed lay-ups, botched rebounds, and miscommunication on defense—marred the play of both sides.
Lin energized the crowd when he drove down the right baseline and dunked to make it 4-2 in favor of the Crimson, and Harvard later went on a seven-point run to take a 17-10 lead—capped by a Webster three with 12:46 to go. But the Bulldogs wouldn’t go away without a fight, cutting the deficit to 17-16 two minutes later.
“We let them stay in the game, gave them some confidence,” senior forward Pat Magnarelli said.
Harvard went up by four with 3:53 remaining after a great pass from Lin to a cutting Magnarelli, who threw down a two-handed dunk.
A minute and a half later, the Crimson opened an eight-point lead on a Lin three, but Bryant came back with a three of its own to cut the lead to five.
Lin responded with another three-pointer as time expired in the half, putting the Crimson up eight going into the break, and the team never looked back.
Starting the second half on a 18-5 run, Harvard opened up a 21-point lead with 11:49 to go, capped by a short jumper from freshman Brandyn Curry.
With his team sporting a healthy lead at the top of the half, Lin was taken out of the game, and Webster and Magnarelli picked up the scoring load.
“Within the first four minutes, we pushed the lead up to about fifteen, and from there it was just maintaining the lead, playing hard on defense, hitting our shots,” said Magnarelli, who scored six points in a four-minute span early in the second half to help Harvard build its lead.
Magnarelli finished with 11 points in 17 minutes, the second-consecutive productive game from the forward who missed his entire junior season with a knee injury.
Connecting on five of seven field goals, Webster was also effective in the 20 minutes he made it on the court.
Harvard was still up by 20 with under eight minutes to go in the contest, when Lin made a huge block and followed it with a nice pass to sophomore guard Max Kenyi, who cut down the baseline and hit a layup to finish the fast break. Harvard scored 16 points in transition, compared to just two for Bryant.
After a Bryant three, starting guard sophomore Oliver McNally converted on a three-point play with 6:49 remaining, and the lead got as large as 26 on a three by freshman Dee Giger with 1:58 to go.
Fellow highly-touted freshman Kyle Casey also posted formidable stats. The forward showed instances of dominance in the paint, calling for the ball often and finishing with seven points and seven rebounds in 18 minutes. Curry added six points, four rebounds, and three assists in the same amount of time.
Bryant, meanwhile, continued to have enormous troubles shooting the ball. The Bulldogs shot just 28.6 percent in the second half and started just 1-for-14 from the three-point line.
The Crimson led in nearly every statistical category. Perhaps most impressive was its points in the paint, where it dominated Bryant 40-16. Though he had trouble finishing, sophomore Keith Wright ended up with nine points.
The entire Harvard roster saw minutes in the blowout victory. Freshmen Jeff Georgatos, Spencer de Mars, and Peter Edelson all logged their first minutes, and Georgatos collected two points and a rebound.
Amaker continued to use the extended rotation to keep his players fresh. Ten different players saw 14 minutes or more of playing time for the Crimson, whose bench outscored the Bulldogs’, 43-20.
The even distribution of minutes, as well as the extended second-half lead, resulted in more rest for Lin, who—after scoring a combined 43 points in his first two games—played a season-low 27 minutes and attempted only seven shots. Instead, he tried to open things up for his teammates, finishing with six assists.
“I thought [Jeremy] was very efficient,” Amaker said. “He’s responsible for so many more points than he ever scores for our team, and there are times when he scores a lot.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a season in which the traditional power structure of the ECAC has been upended and upstart programs have challenged the dominance of perennial powerhouses, the Harvard women’s hockey team reminded its followers of the good old days this weekend.
The Crimson (5-3-1, 5-3-0 ECAC) hit the road and plowed through conference bottom-feeders Yale and Brown in convincing fashion, shutting out the Bulldogs (1-7-1, 1-7-0), 5-0, and trouncing the Bears (1-6-3, 0-5-3), 5-1.
Freshman Jillian Dempsey and junior Kate Buesser each scored three points against Yale, while senior goaltender Christina Kessler made 21 saves to notch the clean sheet on Friday in New Haven, Conn.
On Saturday, Harvard continued its offensive tear against Brown in Providence, R.I., with both veterans and rookies making solid contributions in an easy victory.
The two wins were a refreshing change of course for the Crimson, which came into the weekend feeling short-changed after a 1-1 tie with No. 4 New Hampshire on Wednesday. Harvard was the underdog in that contest, but felt it outplayed the Wildcats and was less than satisfied with the draw.
“People not on the team, like fans that would come to the game, they were saying, ‘That’s great you tied the No. 4 team.’” Dempsey said. “Obviously the tie is okay, but it was a little bit disappointing just because we realized that we could have won that game, and we should have—that we were the better team.”
There were no such mixed feelings after this weekend, one that harkened back to the days when the Crimson could count on easy wins against certain opponents.
“It’s great to win both games in a weekend,” Kessler said. “We’re pretty happy with the way we played.”
HARVARD 5, BROWN 1
After Yale failed to muster any sort of serious challenge against the Crimson on Friday, Harvard appeared to be in for more of an even battle on Saturday against Brown.
The Crimson got on the board first when freshman Kaitlin Spurling lit the lamp 3:37 into the first period off assists from linemates junior Ashley Wheeler and senior Randi Griffin.
But the Bears held Harvard scoreless for the rest of the first frame and struck back 6:43 into the second with Alena Polenska’s goal.
That would be the last that the Crimson would hear from the Brown offense. Harvard reclaimed the lead less than four minutes later on the power play, when co-captain and defenseman Cori Bassett took a pass from junior Leanna Coskren and blasted a shot into the Bears net to give her team a 2-1 lead.
From then on, it was all Harvard. The Crimson poured in three consecutive goals, including two more with the man advantage. Harvard went 3-for-7 on the power play, a marked improvement in an area in which the squad had been struggling.
“I think that really set the tone for the rest of the game,” Kessler said. “We were successful on our power play. That’s something we haven’t been able to do much this season.”
On the defensive side, the Crimson continued its strong play, with Kessler making 26 saves to build on what has been a very solid season for the senior netminder.
“Kessler, she’s unbelievable in net,” Dempsey said. “We rely on her a lot. She comes up with some amazing saves.”
HARVARD 5, YALE 0
The Bulldogs had no answer for the Crimson offense on Friday, as Harvard struck early and often in a contest that was over shortly after it began.
The rookie-veteran duo of Dempsey and Buesser led the way for the Crimson, collaborating on three of Harvard’s goals and combining for six points in the game.
“[Dempsey’s] a great player,” Buesser said. “She’s just a great hard worker. That’s all you could ask for in a linemate. She’s just easy to work with.”
Dempsey echoed Buesser’s sentiments.
“I love working with Buesser,” Dempsey said. “We kind of have, I wouldn’t say the same style of play, but we complement each other really well. I always know that she’s going to go out there as hard as she can and be in the right spots at the right time”
Dempsey was just one of several freshmen to contribute to the Harvard scoring effort this weekend. The short-staffed Crimson has been forced to rely on its rookies this season, and the young skaters have responded to the challenge.
“We’ve had to have them grow up really quickly,” Buesser said. “We say they’re not freshmen anymore because we can’t afford it. They’ve done a great job of transitioning [to the college game].”
Harvard’s weekend sweep provides it with momentum as it looks to climb up the ECAC standings, but with an unprecedented level of parity in the conference, the Crimson knows that future wins won’t come as easily.
“I think the fact that no team has gone undefeated [in ECAC play] so far this season really proves that the league is getting a lot more competitive,” Kessler said. “There’s going to be a battle to be the top spot.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the Harvard men’s basketball team’s 77-51 victory over Bryant on Friday, the 26-point margin of victory masked the Crimson’s lackluster first-half performance. With less than four minutes to go before intermission, Harvard held just a 26-24 lead over its winless opponent.
“We anticipated that they would give us a battle,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “We knew that they had played some tough competition...and they were better than the 0-3 record.”
The most obvious problem was Harvard’s repeated difficulty in completing scoring opportunities.
“We didn’t finish as well as we wanted to in the first half,” Amaker said. “We left a number of buckets where we just didn’t finish.”
Short shots by big man Keith Wright and co-captain guard Jeremy Lin rattled around the rim but simply refused to drop. Fellow post presences—freshman Kyle Casey and co-captain Doug Miller—also struggled down low, combining for only two points in the first half.
Standing at an imposing 6’9, Bryant sophomore center Papa Lo undoubtedly altered some shot attempts, and the Bulldogs’ overall physical style of play helped them stay in the contest.
“I thought their kids were out-scrapping us a little bit for loose balls,” Amaker said.
The Crimson would quickly turn things around. Following a late first-half timeout, Harvard closed out the frame strongly, going on a 9-3 run.
The momentum carried over into the game’s final 20 minutes, when the Crimson finally found its edge, shooting a stellar 53 percent from the field.
POWER IN THE PAINT
The number of the night was 40—as in the number of points Harvard collected in the paint. The Crimson only scored 30 interior points in last week’s home opener against William & Mary, despite having three extra overtime periods of play.
“I thought in the second half, we attacked the rim better,” Amaker said. “It makes a big difference when we get chances to finish with layups or dunks.”
Much of the increased production has been a direct result of the play of senior Pat Magnarelli. Since his return from a knee injury that cost him his last two seasons, the forward has been an interior anchor for Harvard.
“It drives you crazy because you see what we’ve missed for two years,” Amaker said. “He’s such a steady, calming force out there on the floor for our team.”
Magnarelli collected 11 points—including a thunderous two-handed dunk over a Bulldog defender—and four rebounds in only 17 minutes off the bench, but he was just one component of a concerted team effort to go inside.
Wright led his squad in shot attempts with 10, scoring nine points, and Miller and Casey had a number of contested layups find the bottom of the net.
“We always want to go inside and work from the inside out,” Magnarelli said. “We knew they were a little undersized, so we definitely wanted to pound it down low.”
BREAKIN’ OUT
Amaker’s commitment to using his deep bench is clear, as he has consistently relied on an 11-man rotation throughout the team’s first three games.
His substitution strategy has made it a question of when—not if—a freshman will step up and have a breakout performance.
It was Dee Giger’s turn to shine against Holy Cross one week ago. The newcomer had 13 points on four-of-six shooting from behind the arc, including a couple of crucial three-pointers in the second half, earning him Ivy League Rookie of the Week.
Although Giger’s stroke has since cooled off a bit, classmate Christian Webster stole the spotlight Friday night. The rookie guard tied Lin with a game-high 12 points, making five of the seven field goals he attempted.
“I thought this was one of Webster’s better games,” Amaker said. “He can certainly shoot the ball.”
His trio of three-pointers came in the first half, providing Harvard’s only long-distance success until Lin hit a trey with four seconds left before intermission.
The Washington, D.C. native displayed his versatility, racking up all three of his assists in the second half, nabbing a couple of offensive rebounds and a block for good measure.
“Right now it’s about getting the freshmen comfortable,” Lin said. “Once everyone’s comfortable, we’re hoping we can run away with everything in terms of offense.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Princeton football coach Roger Hughes has been relieved of his duties, the university announced yesterday.
Hughes, who has been with the Tigers for the last 10 seasons, was 47-52 in his career at Princeton. The highlight of his tenure came in 2006, when his Tigers went 9-1 to claim the Ivy title.
Princeton struggled this season, reeling from the loss of leaders on both sides of the ball.
Co-captain Jordan Culbreath, the league’s top returning tailback, went down in Week 2 when a sprained ankle led to a diagnosis of aplastic anemia, and co-captain linebacker Scott Britton was felled in Week 5 by a season-ending knee injury.
The Tigers rallied to a 3-4 Ivy record, good for fourth place in the conference, with wins over Yale and Dartmouth to end the season.
But the 2009 campaign was marked by inconsistency for Princeton. The Tigers took Colgate, a top team in the Patriot League, to double overtime, but they were embarrassed by Columbia (38-0), Harvard (37-3), and Penn (42-7).
When Princeton visited Harvard Stadium last month, the Crimson held the squad to just 157 offensive yards.
Hughes was the offensive coordinator at Dartmouth before joining the Tigers in 2000.
A national search has been initiated to find his successor, and the fate of the rest of the coaching staff remains unclear.
Later this week, Princeton officials say they will work out how Hughes will serve out the remainder of his contract.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s and women’s fencing teams started their season off on the right foot this weekend at the Garret Penn St. Open. In a tournament designed to shake off the offseason cobwebs, three Crimson fencers medaled in the tournament.
“I think we were all a little bit rusty,” co-captain epeé Karl Harmenberg said. “But overall I think it felt good. Next week we’ll hopefully be a little bit sharper.”
“This weekend was just preparation for next weekend,” co-captain epeé Noam Mills added. “We saw some weaknesses that we are going to be working on so next weekend we can perform well.”
Sophomore co-captains Mills and Caroline Vloka began their seasons similarly to the end of their freshmen years to lead the women’s team in the tournament. Vloka—who won the tournament last year in the sabre—finished second to Notre Dame’s Sarah Burrmann, securing a silver medal in the event. Mills notched the bronze medal after a close bout with national champion epeé fencer—and fellow Israeli national teammate—Anastasia Ferdman, 15-14.
“We were on the same junior-national team,” Mills said of Anastasia Ferdman. “We do have a history, and we know each other...but overall it doesn’t matter who I am fencing.”
The women welcome five new fencers to the team this year, boasting one of Harvard’s youngest squads ever. But it seems like the freshmen fit right in, bringing talent and a breath of fresh air to the reigning Ivy League champions.
“We have the opportunity to really set a high-intensity spirit on the team,” Harmenberg said. “The freshmen come with a lot of excitement. We can build on that and get the older people more excited.”
The Crimson was able to place nine of its fencers on the day, all of whom were freshmen and sophomores. In addition to Vloka’s performance, Harvard placed two other sabre fencers, including freshman Elena Helgiu in 16th and sophomore Hayley Levitt in 28th.
Helgiu may be the answer to the Crimson’s sabre woes of the past, as she surprised many in her first collegiate tournament.
“She faced a lot of the stronger fencers in the country,” Mills said. “It was a really good start for her for the season.”
Epeé looked to be the Crimson’s strongest weapon on the day, placing four individuals, including Mills. Freshmen Nadia Eldeib, Felicia Sun, and Alexa Fishman each finished 18th, 19th, and 44th respectively in the tournament.
Leading the women’s foil for the Crimson was sophomore Shelby MacLeod, who notched a 13th-place finish. Joining her on the rankings was freshman Katherine Chou, who came in 30th.
Sophomore sabre Valentin Staller led the way for the men, finishing second overal to earn a silver medal. Staller defeated Daniel Bak from Penn State, 15-11.
Harmenberg acknowledges the feats of the sophomores on the team, noting that while Staller and sophomore James Hawrot both had decent rookie years, they really began to come into their own during their first weekend out this season. The men will look to the two fencers to lead the team in its success throughout the year.
Following suit in the sabre and epeé were freshmen Thomas Kolasa and Hawrot, who each notched fifth place for their respective weapons.
Harmenberg finished 18th on the day in epeé, while fellow co-captain Long Ouyang tallied a 26th-place ranking in the foil.
The Crimson will look to continue their season next Sunday at the Harvard Invitational.

After an impressive 2-0 start to the season, the Harvard women’s basketball team (2-1) suffered its first loss, 92-77, at the hands of Sacred Heart (1-2) on Saturday in Fairfield, Conn.  Sophomore Brogan Berry led the Crimson with a team- and season-high 20 points, but the Pioneers’ dominant three-point shooting and rebounding were too much to overcome.
“We went into the game thinking we could win it,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said, “so we’re a little disappointed that we didn’t.”
The Crimson began with a 5-0 run and extended its lead to double digits four minutes into the game. But Harvard’s defense—a weak spot throughout the game—was unable to hold off Sacred Heart’s offensive onslaught. Following a timeout, the Pioneers pulled back within one of the Crimson off of three-straight three-point shots in just over a minute.
“Obviously it was a tough loss,” Berry said. “I think we just had a mental lapse on defense, but I also think we learned a lot from the game.”
Harvard’s struggles are rooted in a continued search for a definitive style of play, a crucial step for the young squad.
“With a young team, we’re still struggling with our identity,” Delaney-Smith said. “We want defense and rebounding to be our identity, and we fell short on that during the game.”
“We still need to improve on communication and making game adjustments,” Berry added. “We do have a lot of young players, and we’re still learning about one another, as well as the offense and the system of college basketball.”
In the last two games, it seemed as if Harvard had been playing together for years, as the team toppled Boston College and Maine.  But against Sacred Heart, which had opened its season 0-2, the Crimson’s inexperience finally came to light.
“Sacred Heart played one heck of a game,” Delaney-Smith said. “They shot the lights out and played really hard. We went against a team that was red hot, and we just didn’t put our best game on the floor.”
The statistic that best defined Sacred Heart’s torrid offensive output was its three-point shooting percentage—an astounding 62.5 percent.
On top of the Pioneers’ deft touch from beyond the arc, Sacred Heart’s aggressive rebounders also plagued Harvard. Although the Crimson dominated the boards in the first half, grabbing 21 rebounds in comparison to its opponents’ 11, Sacred Heart reversed the roles in the second half, pulling down 25 off the glass, compared to the Crimson’s 14. Overall, the Pioneers held an edge in rebounds, 36-35, at the end of regulation.
Behind Berry, the Crimson relied on junior co-captain Christine Matera, who recorded a season-high 12 points, junior Emma Markley, who contributed 10 points, and sophomore Caitlin Rowland, who added a career-high 11.
Despite the loss, Harvard is still optimistic about its remaining schedule.
“We’re lucky the game came early in the season,” Delaney-Smith said. “It was a good wake-up call and reminded us of what we need to work on once we get in to conference play.”
“We’re going to take one game at a time,” Berry added. “We have a tough non-conference and conference schedule, so we’re going to have to work on our weaknesses in each game we play.”
Next up for Harvard is a road game against New Hampshire on Nov. 24. The Wildcats are 2-2 on the season and will likely give the Crimson a good opportunity to both develop its identity as a team and improve on its early-season weaknesses.
“Every game, every practice is a learning experience,” Berry said. “It’s our chance to make ourselves and our teammates better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If the fall season is meant for practice, Harvard is getting plenty of it, going toe-to-toe with some of the nation’s best teams. Unfortunately for Crimson wrestling, it knows that top-tier competition comes with a price.
Harvard (1-2) returned to Binghamton, N.Y. and took down Sacred Heart, but fell in lopsided contests to No. 17 Penn State and Northern Iowa in the Journeyman/Brute Northeast duals yesterday. Although, the Crimson took its lumps in both defeats, Harvard coach Jay Weiss highlighted the learning aspect of challenging dual matches.
“Going up against guys like Penn State and Northern Iowa is good for us,” Weiss said. “There are things we need to work on, some glaring problems that we need to fix as a team, but we got better today, and we just need to keep plugging.”
In addition to welcoming tough bouts, Crimson grapplers also expressed excitement for the team’s potential in the dual season.
“I would say [dual format] is a strength [for us],” sophomore Walter Peppelman said. “Anytime the team comes together, working towards a common goal, how could it not be a strength?”
HARVARD 27, SACRED HEART 14
The Crimson earned its first win of the season in the squad’s final match of the day. After both teams had battled through two earlier contests, it appeared that Harvard had a bit more left in the tank to come away with a team victory. The Crimson overcame the Pioneers despite missing a number of wrestlers due to injury or ineligibility.
A failed skin test, torn knee ligament, and semester off from school sidelined three grapplers, but a frustrated Weiss also hailed the setbacks as an opportunity to give the squad’s young grapplers a look.
“Our dual team will look completely different next semester,” Weiss said, “but on the other side, we’ve got four or five freshmen in the lineup, which is great.”
Rookies Tony Buxton (141) and Steven Keith (125) were the only newcomers to come up with wins against the Pioneers, but Keith’s win by forfeit and Buxton and Peppelman’s back-to-back falls gave the Crimson a crucial 18-point boost. Peppelman (149) needed only six seconds to topple his opponent.
Along with strong performances from the squad’s youth, co-captain J.P. O’Connor (157) remained a stalwart for Harvard, extending his undefeated season with his third decision of the day. O’Connor just squeaked by the Pioneers’ Anthony Priore 6-5 but moved into fourth place all-time on the Crimson wins list after an 8-0 start to the year.
Sophomores Bryan Panzano (174) and Spencer DeSena (285) also notched wins in the contest.
NORTHERN IOWA 26, HARVARD 10
The Crimson led through five bouts but couldn’t come up with a win in the higher weights, as Harvard fell to the Panthers for its second loss of the day.
Despite big wins from Keith and O’Connor, as well as a major decision from Peppelman, Harvard dropped the 165 through heavyweight match-ups to turn a 10-9 edge into a lopsided loss.
After a disappointing end to the match, Weiss noted that the team would benefit from a bit of rest.
“We’re at the tail end of a big push [in training],” Weiss said. “[This week] we’ll take a little break…do a lot more film study, and come back fresh from it.”
NO. 17 PENN STATE 36, HARVARD 6
The Crimson found itself overwhelmed in its first match of the day, but No. 3 O’Connor boasted the most noteworthy bout. The Harvard co-captain produced a rare bright spot in the Crimson’s morning session, dominating what was billed as a close match-up between top-10 grapplers. Taking on No. 4 Cyler Sanderson, O’Connor cruised to an 8-2 decision.
“We were looking forward to that match…and it wasn’t even a close match,” Weiss said. “That [win] was huge. It just shows that J.P. is wrestling at the top of his game.”
Panzano also posted a strong effort—topping Michael Lorenzo in a tight 1-0 contest—but the rest of Harvard’s grapplers came up short against the Nittany Lions. Penn State earned three falls, one technical fall, and a major decision to put the match out of reach.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s heavyweight and lightweight crews wrapped up the fall season on Saturday in the Foot of the Charles Regatta.
The varsity squads for both the lights and the heavies split up into fours and raced against one another, while freshmen eights from both crews  took the water.
The Crimson’s heavyweight A four had the best finish among the team’s boats, crossing the line in  13:18.7—just under nine seconds behind first-place Brown.
Harvard’s heavyweight B and D boats also posted strong results, coming in fifth and seventh place, respectively.
The B four finished in  13:29.1, while the C squad came in at 13:38.5.
“We had some pretty strong races,” said senior C boat rower Duncan Gilchrist. “We obviously didn’t meet our hopes or our goals...[but it’s] something to build off into the winter training.”
The Harvard heavyweight freshman eight capped off its fall season in style, winning the rookie race in 12:19.5.
“It’s a very strong class,” Gilchrist said. “It’s an indication of a good work ethic.”
Several Crimson lightweight boats also took to the water, taking the opportunity to measure its progress this fall while facing off against tough heavyweight competition.
The lights’ A four impressed with an eighth-place finish, crossing the line in 13:38.5.
“We thought we had a really good race,” said lightweight senior coxswain Dexter Louie. “The weather was a litte bit windy, which tends to favor heavyweights. But the guys and I feel like we had a pretty good rhythm.”
The lightweight freshmen also performed well in their eights race,  finishing their stellar first season with a 12:58.8 time, good enough for fourth place in the race.
“They’re a group of guys who have a lot of talent and have a lot of speed,” Louie said. “Hopefully it’s a sign of good things to come.”
Both Crimson crews now head into the winter set to train for the spring sprints season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
No top runners? No problem for the Crimson women. But the men’s squad may have some ground to make up.
With three Harvard cross-country runners preparing for NCAA Nationals today, the rest of the team returned to Van Cortlandt Park, N.Y. on Saturday to compete in the ECAC and IC4A championships.
The women finished ninth in ECAC competition, placing three runners in the top 50, while the men came in 13th among IC4A teams.
“It was a rough day for our team,” junior Ryan Neely said. “We’ve had a rash of illnesses and injuries…[and] we were feeling it. Everyone did what they could.”
Crimson coach Jason Saretsky took a bit more of an optimistic approach to the team’s effort, noting that a bout of H1N1 flu had limited the roster.
“I’m proud of the kids for getting back out there and getting after it,” Saretksy said. “We’ve had a rough go with illness—it’s a tough time of year—but I’m proud of the kids that were able to compete.”
On top of various personnel setbacks, both squads arrived to find yet another surprise at the course in a season filled with strange circumstances. Just two weeks after NCAA Regionals at Franklin Park were reduced to a mudbath, Harvard found the New York terrain to be unrecognizable due to construction. The signature set of hills that make Van Cortlandt Park so challenging was roped off.
“[The race] was really weird because the course was so different,” junior captain Jamie Olson said. “We just did three loops that were pretty flat…it felt like a very long track.”
Still, as the Crimson women have often done this season, the team took the difficulties in stride, with freshman Sammy Silva and Olson leading the way.
Silva—who was named to the U.S. Track and Field/Cross Country Coaches Association All-Region team for the Northeast after placing 11th at NCAA Regionals—crossed the line first for Harvard on Saturday, taking 20th overall in 17:58.5. Olson finished right behind her teammate, posting a 17:59.03 on the 5k course—another good showing in a race that could have been a letdown.
“There weren’t a lot of stakes riding on ECAC’s,” Olson said. “It was really just a race to get out there…enjoy racing, and finish strong.”
The rest of the Crimson continued the season trend of quality effort from young runners, with sophomore Jeanne Mack, and freshmen Stephanie Barnett and Kirsten Jorgensen rounding out the scoring. With so many underclassmen stepping up this fall, Olson voiced encouragement regarding the team’s future.
“Hopefully we’ll be even stronger [next year],” Olson said of a squad that will return all of its scorers in 2010. “We have some more maturity—the sophomores [will have] another year under their belts, and the freshmen will have a little bit more of an edge.”
The men hope to enjoy a similar resurgence, as Harvard will return its top five on this side as well. Neely crossed the line first for the Crimson on Saturday, finishing in 26:32.0 for 48th. Sophomores Ben Entowitz and Michael Hoffman followed in 53rd and 62nd, respectively, while rookies Jakob Lindaas and Sean Poherence completed the effort on the 8k course.
Although Neely was displeased with his personal performance—citing a better showing at Heptagonals on Oct. 30—the junior echoed Olson’s sentiments that the squad would come back strong next fall.
“We’re looking really promising for next year,” Neely said. “Especially after getting the kinks out for the younger guys, who are definitely going to be a huge help to us next year, we’re in a strong place to build off of. We’ve taken big steps towards performing better in the Ivy League and in bigger races.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Clarkson men’s hockey team struck gold Saturday night, mustering two goals late in the third period to come away with a 2-2 tie against Harvard at Bright Hockey Center.
The Crimson (1-4-2, 1-4-2 ECAC) outshot the Golden Knights (4-8-1, 1-4-1), 43-20 and had a stranglehold on the tempo of the game for the first two periods. In the third period, Harvard remained in control, but a defensive letdown with four minutes to go allowed Clarkson to score twice in 50 seconds.
“We didn’t beat ourselves, but we tied ourselves to a certain extent,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We got to learn how to play smart in the third period but maintain our aggressiveness and our pressure on them...the concern is we got to play a complete hockey game.”
Harvard came out quickly in the first period, and six minutes into the contest, freshman Louis Leblanc scored the first goal of the game at even strength.  The goal-scoring play began when Clarkson goaltender Paul Karpowich and a Golden Knight defender tried to corral a loose puck in the crease. During the clearance attempt, Leblanc stole the puck, swiftly wrapped around the net, and tucked it in the left corner of the goal. The score was Leblanc’s third of the year, tying him with sophomore Alex Killorn and junior Michael Biega for the team lead in points. The three forwards play on the same line together and have been the major source of Harvard’s offensive output this season.
With Killorn, Michael Biega, and Leblanc leading the way, the Crimson pestered the Clarkson defense for the majority of the game.
“We just kept it simple,” captain Alex Biega said. “We established a forecheck, we played in their zone, we got pucks on the net.”
Karpowich stopped a number of menacing Harvard chances in the first period to keep Clarkson within striking distance. He finished the contest with 41 saves.
Four minutes into the second frame, Nick Pokulok was whistled for hitting from behind. The Crimson capitalized on the ensuing power play. Off a pass from Michael Biega, freshman Alex Fallstrom rifled a one timer on net. Karpowich made a pad save, but the rebound fell right to freshman Marshall Everson. Everson slammed the puck home, putting Harvard up 2-0. By the end of the second period, Harvard had built a 29-7 advantage in shots.
“I think we did a lot of good things,” Donato said. “We were very much in control of the game for the first 57 minutes or so.”
Not much changed at the beginning of the third period, but things took a drastic turn with five minutes remaining in the game. Having yet to generate any real opportunities on net, the Clarkson attack started to threaten the Crimson goaltender, junior Ryan Carroll. Sixteen minutes into the period, Golden Knight Bryan Rufenach blasted a shot at Carroll, who deflected it with his right pad. Rufenach quickly raced through the Harvard defense to the loose puck and finished the rebound.
Thirty seconds later, Clarkson earned a faceoff in its offensive zone. The puck was knocked toward the Crimson goal, causing a commotion in front of Carroll. In the pile-up, the Golden Knights’ Matt Beca got his stick on the puck and forced it into the net.
Neither team could register the game-winner in regulation or in overtime, and the final score stayed 2-2.
“Obviously it’s a frustrating, frustrating game,” Donato said. “At times when the heat gets turned up, we’re actually trying to do too much, and we’re accomplishing less.”
With the draw, Harvard’s winless streak extends to six games. Three of those games—Colgate, Cornell, and Clarkson—featured both a Crimson lead and then a major Harvard defensive collapse in the third period.
“To put it in [its] simplest form, we need to be better,” Alex Biega said. “There’s not one individual on our team who can really look back on the past seven games and have said that they’ve played to their full capability.”
Against Clarkson, the Crimson found some hope in its special teams. Despite coming up short with a man advantage in overtime, Harvard went one for four on the power play and seven for seven on the penalty kill.
Carroll started the game between the pipes for the Crimson, replacing junior Kyle Richter, who has started five of six games this season.
“I’m going to try to play the best guys every night to give us a chance to win that night,” Donato said.
Looking to emerge from the ECAC basement, Harvard finishes the semester with four home games.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The second-ranked Harvard women’s squash team (2-0, 1-0 Ivy) hardly seemed to break a sweat this weekend in tallying their first two victories of the season. The national powerhouse Crimson crushed Ivy League foe No. 10 Brown (0-1, 0-1 Ivy) on Friday before breezing past out-of-conference opponent No. 8 Williams (0-2) on Sunday. The weekend’s victories boosted Harvard to a 2-0 record, a start that surprises none given the team’s stacked lineup and a national championship appearance last year.
Harvard coach Satinder Bajwa cited “depth and well-being”—both physically and mentally—as the two essential qualities for the team to have success this upcoming season.
The Crimson will need to be at its prime in both areas to challenge the team that deprived them of a collegiate championship last year, the Princeton Tigers, when they come to Cambridge on February 7. But according to Bajwa, the Tigers—who lost to Stanford yesterday—might not be at the level they played last year.
“Other than Trinity, I think we’re on the right track to be among the favorites to do very well this year” Bajwa said. “This is the deepest team I have coached in my eleven years at Harvard.”
Stirring words from a coach who boasts an 81-28 record, 33 All-Americans, a national championship appearance in 2008-2009, and a national championship victory in 2001 in his 10 years of coaching Harvard.
HARVARD 9, WILLIAMS 0
The Crimson continued their dominant streak in a 9-0 blanking of No. 8 Williams on Sunday. Freshman Laura Gemmell, after not playing against Brown, returned to her No. 1 spot, where she challenged Ephs’ senior Toby Eyre. Eyre was ranked third in the nation in the individual preseason polls entering this match, but Gemmell took no heed of her opponent’s qualifications, downing Eyre in three straight games 11-6, 11-7, and 11-8.
Although she considered Sunday’s match “to be a tougher match than Friday’s” against Brown, sophomore phenom Nirasha Guruge was in fine form as well, handling Jennifer Coxe in three straight games. Junior June Tiong, who played No. 1 for Harvard last season, dominated her set against Williams’ Courtney Bogle 11-3, 11-3, 11-4.
In spite of the excellent play at the top of the ladder, Bajwa said he was most impressed by the performance of sophomore Emily Park at the 9 spot. Park, who played No. 3 last year as a freshman, battled injury throughout the preseason. Not only did she play a full set today, but she also tallied another win for Harvard in a triumphant fashion—11-4, 11-1, 11-1.
“Emily surprised me in a good way in that she’s almost totally recovered,” Bajwa said.
HARVARD 9, BROWN 0
The Crimson spoiled Brown’s Friday by capturing 27 of 28 games in a resounding victory over their Ivy League opponent.
Harvard wasted no time in asserting their dominance, jumping out to a 3-0 start as junior Alisha Mashruwala won three straight 11-5 contests against Sarah Crosky at the No. 2 spot. Co-Captain Katherine O’Donnell, playing at the No. 4 position, seized a commanding win over the Bears’ Kali Schellenberg, 11-5, 11-3, 11-5.
Playing at the top spot of the roster, Guruge tallied relatively close wins of 11-6 and 11-5, before gaining momentum to down Brown’s Laura Pynes 11-0 in the third game. When asked if this weekend’s play was indicative of Harvard’s prospects for this season, Guruge seemed confident yet wary.
“Brown and Williams weren’t that hard, but there will be more pressure against stronger opponents” Guruge said. “Now that we have such a good player at No. 1, the top of the ladder should be very solid.”
Even in the absence of Gemmell, the freshmen worked magic in their first intercollegiate performances.
Freshman Natasha Kingshott conquered the Bears’ Sophie Scherl in straight games. Fellow freshman Sarah Mumanachit recorded the one loss of the entire weekend in her first game against Lydia Smith, 9-11, but took the next three games, 11-7, 11-5 and 11-5 to win the set.
“I’m very happy with the five freshmen who have joined our team,” Bajwa said. “They have made our team much stronger.”
Co-Captain Johanna Snyder won her three games easily, while senior Sandra Mumanachit won at the No. 9 spot by defeating Leila Driansky, 11-3, 11-6 and 11-5.
The Crimson hope to keep their winning streak alive when they travel to Hanover, NH on Dec. 2 to take on 1-0 Dartmouth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two matches and two dominating victories—for Harvard men’s squash, the season got off on the right foot.
The No. 5 Crimson traveled to Providence, R.I. on Friday to take on No. 13 Brown. Harvard swept the Bears, 9-0, dropping just two games on the day.
Saturday’s match sent the Crimson to Williamstown, Mass., where No. 10 Williams provided a bit more of a challenge, but Harvard still came away with the 6-3 win.
The Crimson’s top six players went undefeated on the weekend, and the top four on the ladder swept their respective matches.
“These two matches are the two easiest ones on our schedule,” co-captain Colin West said. “It’s important to get off to a good start against opponents we’re supposed to beat.”
HARVARD 6, WILLIAMS 3
In Saturday’s matchup, talent won out over depth, as Harvard earned victories at the top six spots to take a 6-3 decision.
“The Williams match was more encouraging,” co-captain Frank Cohen said. “We had two five-gamers that we were able to win, which speaks to how much we’ve trained.”
West, playing in the top spot and currently ranked second in the nation, easily dispatched the Eph No. 1 William Morris, 11-8, 11-3, 11-2.
Junior Richard Hill, freshman Zeke Scherl, and junior Reed Endresen rolled to wins at the second, third and fourth spots, respectively.
Cohen won, 3-2, at No. 6, while Williams claimed victory at Nos. 7, 8 and 9.
But it was the fifth spot that boasted the day’s most engaging matchup.
Rookie Jason Michas took Eph Bernard Yaros to five games, dropping the first game before rallying to win the second and third.
Yaros took the fourth, and the two battled to a 10-10 tie in the fifth game before Michas took the last two points to win the match, 3-2.
“His match could have been the crucial one,” West said. “He came back and had a mentally very good win. When you’re playing away, to come through despite that as a freshman is really important.”
HARVARD 9, BROWN 0
The Crimson cruised to a win in its season opener, dismantling the overmatched Bears on the road.
Hill set the tone for the weekend with his 3-0 dismissal of Brown’s Brad Thompsen at No. 2 on Friday, winning 11-4, 11-5, 11-5.
“Richard played pretty well,” Michas said. “He struggled against the Brown kid the last time we played Brown, and he took him down pretty easily this time.”
The Bears’ Adrian Leanza gave West a scare in the competitors’ third game. After West took the first two games by identical scores of 11-4, the senior needed extra time to dispose of his opponent, taking the final game, 12-10.
“The guys kind of rely on me and almost assume I’m going to win these matches,” West said. “I don’t want to let them down.”
Scherle, Michas and rookie Alexander Ma all earned their first career victories on Friday. Scherle and Michas rolled to 3-0 sweeps, while Ma rallied after dropping a close first game to Brown’s Alex Heitzmann, taking the match, 9-11, 11-5, 11-8, 11-5.
“We have a lot of freshmen, but they managed to play pretty mentally tough,” West said.
Endresen, Cohen and No. 9 sophomore William Ahmed took their matches in easy 3-0 wins, while senior Alex Lavoie needed an extra game, but prevailed, 3-1, at No. 7.
As the team looks ahead to the meat of its schedule, the opening weekend has set the tone for success.
“I think that our scrimmages were up and down, and this weekend put us on the right track,” Cohen said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks into its season, the Harvard women’s swimming and diving teams are still undefeated and are now one step closer to a repeat title at the Ivy League Championships in February.
This past weekend, the Crimson hosted its home opener and final meet of the calendar year at Blodgett Pool with the Harvard Invitational, dominating the field in a first-place finish.
With the change in Harvard’s academic calendar, the Crimson’s coaches decided to host a meet a few weeks earlier than normal to give the athletes—particularly the freshmen—the opportunity to experience what it will be like in February when the Ivy Championships are held at Blodgett.
Harvard faced strong competition at the Invitational against Big East opponent Rutgers and Ivy League rival Columbia, as well as Sacred Heart and Wagner.
The invitational also replaced the Crimson’s dual matchup with the Lions, and Harvard handled them easily, amassing 1224 points to third-place Columbia’s 698.
The Crimson took advantage of facing such a strong adversary in Rutgers, who was second with 863 points. Harvard typically has not had the opportunity to compete against a Big East team, especially at this point in the season.
“Our team was ready for this meet,” Harvard coach Stephanie Morawski said. “We definitely knew what we wanted to do and what we wanted to accomplish. Sometimes a home meet is fantastic, and sometimes it is distracting. [The team] swam with a lot of heart and they swam smart.”
Junior Katy Hinkle started off the Crimson’s dominant weekend, contributing to Harvard’s sweep of Friday’s events. Hinkle won the 50-yard freestyle with a time of 23.65, and also pitched in to help the 200-yard freestyle and 400-yard medley relay squads win their respective races. Junior Katherine Pickard joined Hinkle in the 400-yard medley relay and also won the 200-yard individual medley.
“[Our team] started [the weekend off by] swimming fast,” Pickard said, “and it got the ball rolling for us.”
As the competition went on, it was clear that Harvard was not relying on one or two swimmers, but that a number of its swimmers could handle the events. In the 50-yard freestyle that Hinkle won, the top five spots were all filled by members of the Crimson.
“We have a very deep team,” junior Christine Kaufmann said. “That’s been one of our strengths for a while. At this meet, we also showed that we have a lot of speed as well.”
Co-captain Alexandra Clarke earned her first victory of the season in the 500-yard freestyle with a time of 4:49.10. According to Morawski, Clarke—a three-time qualifier for the NCAA championships—is faster at this point in the season than she has ever been in her four years on the team.
“Ali is a wonderful swimmer,” Kaufmann said. “She is able to lead us both in and out of the pool, [and] she always finds a way to get her hand on the wall.”
Clarke finished the 500 freestyle a quarter of a second ahead of sophomore Catherine Zagroba, and once again, Harvard swimmers were the top five finishers in the event.
The Crimson continued its commanding performance throughout the weekend. Hinkle, freshman Mackenzie Luick, freshman Kelly Robinson, and junior Ali Slack won the 200-yard medley relay with a time of 1:43.69, only 0.61 seconds ahead of Rutgers’ entry.
The two freshmen later contributed individual wins to the Crimson’s effort as well, as Robinson won the 100-yard butterfly, touching the wall in 55.11 seconds—Harvard swimmers again controlled the race, taking the top four spots for the event—and Luick took the 100-yard breaststroke with a time of 1:03.88.
The Crimson continued its dominance in the 200-yard freestyle, as junior Kate Mills took the event with a time of 1:50.51, leading another Harvard top-five sweep.
“This meet gave our team a lot of confidence,” Kaufmann said. “It produced some pretty great results. We [can now] look at each of our races and find things that need to focus on to get better.”
Sunday brought more domination from the Crimson, which continued to rack up wins through the meet’s final event, the 400-yard freestyle relay.
With its next meet coming in January, Harvard prepares to train and get ready for the stretch of meets before the championship.
“The end of the season is about your depth,” Morawski said. “That’s what won the Ivy title for us last year, and that’s what is going to help us as we go after it again. [We aren’t] just a bunch of athletes who want to win. It’s the belief in one another that has made [us] really strong as a team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson struggled early to get momentum but persevered, and in the end, coach Tim Murphy’s team came home with the win.
Like its football counterparts in New Haven, the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team needed a rally to get the victory, as the Crimson defeated Columbia, 167-133, in New York.
“Columbia was right there with us,” freshman Owen Wurzbacher said. “We really had to step up, and we did.”
Freshman Michael Stanton won the three-meter dive to give Harvard a victory in the first event, but the Lions seemed to be in control of the meet early on, gaining the lead after taking three of the top four spots in the 1000-yard freestyle—canceling out co-captain Alex Meyer’s individual victory.
“We were pretty tired coming into the meet,” senior Mason Brunnick said. “The first half was pretty rough.”
A bright spot was freshman Greg Roop’s individual victory in 200-yard freestyle. On the scoreboard, the performance was just one small win in the midst of back-and forth-battling between the Crimson and the Lions. But his efforts provided a spark for the swimmers after him, particularly because he beat his previous in-season best by two and a half seconds.
“We have better times at the end of the season when we shave and we taper,” Wurzbacher explained. “He was pretty excited. We were all excited.”
“It’s not like we rested,” he added. “For him to step up and go after it like that really set the tone.”
But the momentum didn’t shift until sophomore Rob Newell and Wurzbacher gave the team back-to-back individual victories in the 200-yard backstroke and 200-yard breaststroke. Newell out-touched Columbia’s Darren Pagan by two hundredths of a second, clocking in at 1:53.44.
“[The margin of victory] is basically nothing,” Brunnick said.
An event later, Wurzbacher pulled out a close victory of his own. The rookie passed Columbia’s Ross Ramone in the last 50 yards to take the race. His time of 2:08.17 gave him a half-second margin over Ramone.
“I did what the team needed me to do,” Wurzbacher said. “It definitely wasn’t anything special.”
It was enough, however, to turn the tide for the Crimson.
“Those races…really got our energy going,” Brunnick said.
Brunnick capitalized on the surging momentum with a victory of his own in the next event, the 500-yard freestyle. The senior had been unsatisfied with his performance in the 1,000-yard race, but he made up for it in his second event of the day.
“[My 1000 free] was a good example of how in the first half, we didn’t swim as well as we should have,” he said. “In the second half, a lot of guys stepped up.”
Less than a second after Brunnick redeemed himself, teammate Meyer touched the wall to take second in the race.
“[Meyer] swims with a lot of poise,” Wurzbacher said. “He knows what to do, when to pace himself, when to go. It’s fun to watch him perform.”
Following Brunnick and Meyer’s one-two finish, the Crimson took three of the top four spots in the 100-yard butterfly. Sophomore Nicholas Tan led the way, out-touching Esquen Bruno by one hundredth of a second. From then on, Harvard never looked back, taking four of the five top spots in the 200-yard individual medley, led by sophomore Niall Janney’s first-place finish. Columbia won the final event, the 400-yard freestyle relay, but it was not enough to take the meet from the Crimson.
“It [was] a test to see how tough we are at this point in the season,” Brunnick said. “When we’re tired [we were] still able to swim pretty good times.”

The latest UC election snafu inspired revolutionaries in the class of 2013 to take up the cause against the UC and call for a government “free from corruption” run purely by freshman students.
 
In response to last week’s disputed election results, 2013-ers Jeanine Sinanan-Singh, Izzy Link-Levy, Felix de Rosen, Richard Huang, Billy Gorman, and Benjamin Cohen issued a statement establishing the Weld Thirty-Four (WTF) Republic and encouraging “all to throw off the chains of oppression and join us in our crusade for justice.” This call to arms comes with a new agenda and a new vision for all of Harvard University. 
 
Viva la revolution....after the jump.

 
“Dear Harvard Community,” they wrote in an email. “When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them with the Undergraduate Council, common sense requires them to declare  the causes which impel them to the separation: Considering the recent complications in regard to the UC elections, we, Weld Thirty-Four (hereinafter WTF) and associates, declare null and void the authority of the UC.”
 
In an interview with FlyBy, “Benevolent Leader” Jeanine Sinanan-Singh said, “I think our call to action represents the general Harvard community attitude that the UC is unimportant and the latest election issues really confirms our problems with them.” 
 
The latest press release issued by the WTF Republic lists grievances against the UC, objectives for the new government, and a war agenda that includes colonizing Yale, forcing the UPenn Quakers into war, and holding Emma Watson hostage after invading Brown University.
 
And what do loyal Harvard subjects have to look forward to after the 2013 takeover? The WTF Republic aims to charge Asian tourists per picture (to restore depleted endowments), create a student center, restore hot breakfast, replace Quad shuttles with Teleportation devices, and institute jesters and fast-food restaurants of choice in upperclassman Houses. 
 
FlyBy says watch out: that hot breakfast campaign promise is always a crowd-pleaser.

UC members should expect a whole lot more than they bargained for this evening during their meeting in Sever 113.
FlyBy has gotten wind of the latest undertaking of The WTF Republic, the band of self-described revolutionaries (class of 2013) who released an email and statement calling for all Harvard students to organize under them as an alternative to the UC. Tonight, the WTF Republic will storm Sever and "make it known that we will not sit idly by while a disorganized, meaningless organization mucks up campus politics."
Hear about the latest call to arms after the jump.
"At 7:35 PM, the UC is holding a meeting," the group wrote in the description for the event on Facebook. "At this meeting, they will attempt to certify their presidential election, but we all know that it will most likely result in more of the verbal diarrhea we've witnessed over the past week."
There is great mystery surrounding the madness that might occur this evening, but there is a rallying cry for all Harvard students to attend wearing black as a symbol of solidarity.
Check out the madness, and follow Flyby's liveblog of the event tonight!

And so the bizarre, tortuous saga of the UC Election continues.
As The Crimson reported today, the results of the election will remain uncertified until today's general meeting, during which the entire UC—and not just the executive board—will decide whether to approve John F. Bowman '11 and Eric N. Hysen '11 as next year's president and vice president.
The meeting will take place at Sever 113 at 7:30 p.m.  If you won't be able to attend, keep an eye on FlyBy—we'll be live-blogging as the drama unfolds.  We'll be back in a little over an hour.
In the meantime, brush up on what's happened so far by checking out The Crimson's full coverage of the election.

It's the moment of truth we've all been waiting for.  At tonight's UC general meeting, the results of last week's highly controversial election will finally be settled. Keep watching us for live updates.
9:44 p.m.
It seems as if the UC fiasco has finally been resolved. Most of the UC seems happy and/or relieved. 
So are we.
9:19 p.m.
UC and audience members are presented with a "UC Declaration of Faith in Eric Hysen," prepared by five members of the UC in order to "affirm Hysen's integrity and to thank him for the work he's already contributed to the UC." Aww, how cute.
McLeod declares that she and Flores also want to add their names to the declaration as an amendment. The motion is passed. Hysen's good name is restored. Or so they hope.
9:14 p.m.
Hayward gives a rather bittersweet congratulations to Bowman and Hysen. Zhang claims that he and Hayward only wanted to "leave Harvard better than when we started." Both hope that the issues raised by their campaign would be addressed. 
9:11 p.m.
 We get a three-minute break. And then we'll hear from Hayward and Zhang? They look kind of pissed.

9:09 p.m.
AND THE CERTIFICATION PASSES! BOWMAN-HYSEN ARE ANNOUNCED THE NEW UC PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT! The UC gives them a standing ovation.
9:06 p.m.
It's time for the roll call vote. Thirty-three vote in favor of certification. Four abstain. Two vote to disenfranchise. Guess who? (Hint #1: they ran against Bowman-Hysen. Hint #2: it's not Long-Johnson.)
9:05 p.m.
Another speaker in favor of certifying the results. Hysen's ex-prefrosh. It is "beyond a reasonable doubt" that the results have not been tampered with.
9:04 p.m.
Another speaker against certifying the results. It's the Justice girl. No idea what she said. Had Phil Morris on the phone. UC declares this out of order.
9:02 p.m.
Flores speaks out in favor of certifying the results. "There is no evidence of foul play," she says. "The council I know would never throw away over 2,000 votes."
9:01 p.m.
Hayward speaks out against the results. Surprised? We're not.
"This is nothing personal, but we just have many unanswered questions" he starts off. 
Need we go on?
8:53 p.m.
One concerned student claims that "as a voter, I would feel deeply disenfranchised by a revote."
8:51 p.m. 
A member of the audience makes a valid point: "You can't really alter an election after the fact. You can't undo this," she says. "All you can do is look back on what went wrong and move forward and reform." 
She adds, "As a voter, I would feel deeply disenfranchised by a revote."
8:49 p.m.
A UC member (who had Hysen as a host when he was a prefrosh) stands up to defend Hysen's teddy-bear qualities: "LOOK HIM IN THE EYE AND TELL HIM HE RIGGED THE ELECTION." Because a teddy bear can't rig election, silly.
8:45 p.m.
The floor is still open to UC and audience members to voice questions and comments. People are getting fired up. Some think tampering is incredibly unlikely, while others  still want "justice to be served." We think most of us just want this to get resolved.
8:42 p.m.
Hayward says he did not know that McLeod had locked Flores out of her ucpres@gmail account.
8:35 p.m.
Is this speech really still happening? Flores is telling the girl to stop. She speeds up. More incoherence. Help! We think her point is to tell the UC not to certify the election.
8:26 p.m.
Now a member of the Election Commission makes a statement. The girl starts by presenting a Justice book. She's asking for backup from Kant and Aristotle? We don't really know what's she's talking about. She seems to be saying something about justice in the student election process.
8:24 p.m.
A student asks Hysen straight up if he had the passwords. Ballsy. 
Hysen explains (with surprising clarity) what happened on his end. After former UC Technical Director  Randall S. Sarafa '09 graduated, Hysen was asked by Flores to take his place. Hysen's duties included overssing the basic upkeep of the UC website and other technology-related tasks. As part of this position, Hysen acquired the voting software information and all associated passwords.
But on Sunday, Nov. 15, he and Flores (who also had this information) were told by former chair of the Election Commission Brad A. Seiler '10 that their access to the software had been removed. 
And this is where things get a little complicated. 
Apparently, there are two parts to the election software. The front end deals with the voting itself, the tabulation of results, the addition of candidates, and so on. The back end contains the Audit Log that had been assessed by the FAS IT. Hysen says he assumed that he had been removed from both ends, but it turns out that Seiler had not removed him from the back end. But Hysen swears that he didn't log in to the program and that he was too busy campaigning to have time to do so.
8:22 p.m.
Flores confirms that The E-mail was written by two Hayward-Zhang campaign staffers and one supporter. Interesting.
8:19 p.m.
Hayward stands up for an announcement. "We have to separate that e-mail from what we're talking about right now," he says. "We're not accusing anyone of anything." (He's referring to the e-mail that accused Hysen of tampering with the voting results.  For simplicity's sake, we're just going to call it The E-Mail from now on.) 
Really, now? Hayward claims that he only wants to find out one thing: "Did anyone have access to the software?" Apparently, FAS IT results aren't enough.
8:16 p.m. 
One student (and former member of the Election Commission!) seems to be upset because he thought he was attending this meeting for deliberations. He complains that apparently everyone here has already "unanimously decided" to certify the election.
8:13 p.m.
A freshman UC rep decides he wants to tell a story about how he used to be a hypochondriac who always went to UHS, thinking he was sick even when he had no symptoms. The point of this revelation? We're all being metaphoric hypochondriacs about this UC stuff and should just chill out.
8:12 p.m.
Vice-presidential candidate Eric N. Hysen '11 says that FAS IT is able to identify who logs into the system, and from where.  But they did not find any such evidence.  Hmm...so what else is new?
8:11 p.m.
The same student is still asking the same questions. Is there a point to this? FAS IT found no evidence of hacking. We get it. Admirably, Dean Marine and Flores are keeping their cool.
8:01 p.m.
Assistant Dean of Harvard College for Student Life Susan Marine explains how the UC voting system works. She reads a long list of FAS IT reports, which concludes that the security scans and vulnerability assessment scans "found no significant issues" or "evidence of suspicious activity." Basically, information security was unable to conclude that the Audit Log had been modified in any way. 
After several probing questions from one concerned member of the student audience, Dean Marine acknowledges that there is "no way to guarantee that no one could have possibly manipulated the system," but that there is still no concrete evidence of hacking.
8:00 p.m.
 George J.J. Hayward ’11, a presidential candidate who ran against the Bowman-Hysen ticket, gets up to say that he just wants to get to the bottom of some questions and wants to keep the game from getting "too political." 
We'll see about that.
7:49 p.m.
Current UC Vice President Kia J. McLeod '10 gives an impassioned, well-crafted speech, first apologizing for last Thursday's miscommunications, then pointing out that this debacle has finally shed light on some of the UC's problems. 
She maintains, however, her innocence in the controversy over the e-mail that accused vice-presidential candidate Eric N. Hysen '11 of voting fraud.  "I do not deny my honest words that I did not draft that first e-mail," McLeod says. She states that although the tone of that fateful message was inappropriate, "the spirit in which that e-mail was sent was was to draw attention to the [flawed] election system." 
Translation: she didn't write the e-mail, but she sent it.  So yes, she approved of its contents.
But she seems sincere in her apologies, emphasizing that her intentions were good. "I know I sounded an alarm, but it was not done out of malice," she says. 
McLeod also implores UC members to take this as an opportunity to fix the Council's flawed system, especially taking advantage of the fact that all eyes are on the UC now. "My glowing successes are my only stakes in this game," she announced. 
We're not sure what that last line means, but can we just point out that maybe the fact that this e-mail could be sent also demonstrates one of the UC's "flaws"? 
7:40 p.m.
Current UC President Andrea R. Flores '10 announces that these days have been "incredibly difficult times for the UC," and that their "image is at stake." Beseeching the UC to "move forward" and certify the election, Flores said her recent investigation, conducted with Assistant Dean of Harvard College for Student Life Susan Marine and FAS IT specialists, has revealed that "there is no questionable behavior [in] the UC's voting system" and that this election was "fairly won." 
She also takes a minute to remind the UC to remember that "we are a council, we are students who live and work in the same place," and that "at the end of the day, we are just members of student government, and student government should never be the subject of harsh personal attacks."
 
7:30 p.m. 
UC reps and eager, answer-seeking students are still filing in. Everyone is all smiles, despite the obvious tension in the room.  Guess we're starting on Harvard time?
