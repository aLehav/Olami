After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PARIS, France—When I mention “Paris” and “Tower” to any American, their first response will be the Eiffel Tower. They might reflect back on their own visits to Paris, remembering their walks with their partners along the Seine River or their afternoon picnics by the Eiffel Tower. These dreams rarely include the Montparnasse Tower.
While most of Paris looks like the work of artisans, the Montparnasse Tower looks as if a toddler stuck his brown Lego in the center of the historic city. The 59-story building, built in the 1970s, caused such a huge outcry that two years after its construction, buildings over seven stories were banned from the city. It is that ugly.
The Montparnasse Tower is also where the majority of my summer school program takes place. Our classes, movie nights, and team work sessions all happen on the twentieth and twenty-first floors of the Tower. The third day of the program, our opening ceremony took place in a classroom on the twenty-first floor. The two glass walls opened our room to the rest of the Paris, the view only interrupted by a line of iPhones shooting timelapse videos. The Eiffel Tower juts out before the horizon line. I looked out the window with a glass of champagne in one hand and a macaron in the other, wondering if I would ever get a better view in my life.
It might seem like the only redeeming quality of the Montparnasse Tower is its view of the rest of Paris. Some argue that the best part about this view is that you can’t see the Montparnasse Tower itself when you are inside.
But there is more to this ugly brown brick. About five weeks into the program, we were back in the room where our opening ceremony took place. All of us lay down on oversized bean bags, eating Domino’s pizza as we watched Black Mirror episodes on the projection screen.
A couple hours later, someone shouts and motions us towards the windows. The Eiffel is glittering—it twinkles for the first five minutes of every hour after sundown. As the hour goes by, the sky settles into darkness, and people start to leave. I decide to stay back with ten or so students and a couple members of the teaching staff.
The second time the Eiffel twinkles that night, most of us are no longer lined up by the windows. Most of us are not even in the room. We are in a windowless hallway, rolling around the twenty-first floor in plastic wheeled desks, racing to see who can finish a lap the fastest. Our two teaching staff join, and we all laugh as they sprint and tumble over each other down the hall. At this point, the Eiffel is a familiar view. Seeing my teaching staff speed around in a desk race is not. The view from the Montparnasse Tower is great, but the view inside is sometimes even better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The big news last week was the announcement that a faculty committee issued a report recommending that the College outright ban students from joining “fraternities, sororities and similar organizations—including co-ed groups.” (Set aside for now the fact that it is more difficult to keep track of these faculty committees than of the antipopes during the Western Schism.)  This escalation of the existing sanctions, which merely bar members of these organizations from certain scholarships and leadership roles in recognized student groups, is disturbing but unsurprising. One wonders why it took so long to arrive at the most obvious policy for extirpating the clubs, which have caused tooth-gnashing and garment-rending at the College for several years now.
The committee’s report is notable in several aspects, the first being its jettison of anti-discrimination as the College’s objective in dealing with the final clubs. This means that in less than four months, the College has pivoted from both of its professed goals: First, the combatting of sexual assault, and now the uprooting of sex-based discrimination.
One gets the feeling of having been the victim of an enormous ruse. The committee now thinks that the opposition to sex-based discrimination “is likely to remain inadequate to address the complexities of the socially distorting and pernicious effects of the clubs that exclude while also dominating the social scene.”
This newly found—or perhaps merely newly expressed—belief explains the committee’s absurd practice of using the term “USGSO,” i.e., Unrecognized Single-Gender Social Organization, to refer to clubs that have dropped sex-based admission policies (perhaps now they are UDGSOs?). That these sex-neutral clubs are included in the recommendations makes clear that the committee’s indignation is directed at some other characteristic—perhaps their being “organized” by people other than the committee members, who are wont to moonlight as inept social engineers.
Reading on, we learn that the College’s grievance is actually that whatever benefit accrues to final club members “comes at the expense of the exclusion of the vast majority of Harvard undergraduates.” In Appendix 3 of the report, the committee adduces an anonymous letter from a student testifying that “rejection from final clubs is constant. It occurs each time someone walks down Mt. Auburn Street on a Friday night or overhears dining hall gossip about black tie dinners in secret spaces.”
There we have it: The College is solely focused on assuaging the feelings of the guy who was picked last for the dodgeball game at recess. This squeamishness regarding exclusion is even evinced by the committee’s use of “exclude” as an intransitive verb; it gives no consideration as to who is excluded or for what reason.
There are many clubs at Harvard who accept a very small number of postulants. The Crimson Key Society is notoriously exclusive. As a tour-giving group, it tends to reject people who are shy, dour, or bad at remembering long catalogs of historical information. These rejects then have to deal with the accepted students, who have the effrontery to give tours in public every day of the week. Rejection is always a disappointment, but to be an adult is to know how to move on.
Furthermore, while the letter  dismisses the charge that Harvard College is more selective than any final club, this fact obstinately remains. The anonymous student writes, “The benefits of selective admissions arguably outweigh the costs. If Harvard succeeds in its mission…society benefits.” This is quite true, but there are still around 38,000 people who are not admitted, not all of whom can go instead to “Princeton or Yale,” as he remarks in the style of Marie Antoinette.
Why should he be the one chosen to be trained as a “citizen leader to build companies, lead governments, treat patients and teach students,” while the next fellow is sent off to trade school on the basis of a few measly SAT questions? The final clubs, fraternities, and sororities, when properly used, can produce refined and noble men and women ready for leadership in the world.
Now, I say “when properly used” because, as I have written before, male final club members frequently behave in ways for which they should be censured severely. But the concept of a final club need not be discredited by the poor execution of its members. The College’s goal should be to teach students to enjoy themselves in a controlled, respectful, sophisticated manner, which will not occur if it consigns them to playing bingo in Annenberg on Saturday nights.
There are other interesting tidbits in the report, notably a ridiculous footnote calling our attention to the resignation of Deval L. Patrick ’78 from the Fly Club when he wanted to run for office, as if we needed reminding that politicians are often disingenuous grandstanders. It’s quite amazing that his qualms emerged only after graduation.
I finally know why the Ringling Bros. Circus closed in May: It was getting too much competition from Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In January, when Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced the creation of a faculty committee that could revise or replace penalties on members of single-gender groups, many Faculty members could breathe a sigh of relief: their concerns, it seemed, had been heard.
For months, at meetings of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, in op-eds in The Crimson, and on at least one personal blog, professors had criticized the policy and the way it was crafted. Administrators, they charged, had failed to consult the Faculty on a major University decision that some called discriminatory, and a motion that sought to nullify the policy nearly came to a vote at several Faculty meetings.
But now that that faculty committee has recommended that Harvard bar student membership in all social groups, some professors are back where they started nearly a year ago: unsatisfied with the policy-making process and concerned that administrators are encroaching on Faculty authority in their efforts to upend undergraduate social life at Harvard.
In particular, professors say they are troubled that University President Drew G. Faust, and not the Faculty, is slated to have the final say over the social group recommendations.
In its 22-page report, the faculty committee recommended updating the Harvard College Handbook for Students to include the proposed new social group ban. The committee plans to present its suggestions first to Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith and then to Faust in mid-fall 2017.
“The President will make the final decision,” the report reads.
Multiple faculty members charge that this path to approval goes against precedent—and, some say, against a University statute which delegates “immediate charge” of the College to FAS. Traditionally, the full Faculty has approved changes to the student handbook each year.
“I’ve been on the Faculty and going to Faculty meetings since 1974, and I can’t remember another time when the President has announced a rule that you have to put in the Handbook,” said Harry R. Lewis ’68, a computer science professor and former Dean of the College who is one the social policy’s most vocal opponents. “Those things always go before the Faculty.”
In their email sent to faculty announcing the recommendations, faculty committee co-chairs Suzannah Clark, a music professor, and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana promised to hold “open faculty discussions” in early fall 2017, and to take “faculty consultation… into account” when presenting the committee’s recommendations to Smith and Faust. But the committee has not said it will allow a Faculty vote on the policy.
Clark did not respond to repeated requests for comment. History professor Alison Frank Johnson, a member of the committee, wrote in an emailed statement that she personally hopes the faculty will eventually vote on the recommendations.
“Although I cannot speak for other members of the committee, my own belief during all our committee discussions was that our full report would be presented to the Faculty Council and, if it gained their approval, subsequently to the full FAS Faculty at a Faculty Meeting,” Johnson wrote.
Five professors contacted by The Crimson said they were disturbed by the idea that the recommendations might not come before a full faculty vote. Classics professor Richard F. Thomas said he thought the committee’s plan to approve its recommendations posed “some pretty serious issues... procedurally.”
“This is not an authority that should be given to the President,” Mathematics professor Wilfried Schmid agreed. “The Faculty is a continuing body. The President is temporary.”
Other professors voiced their disapproval in posts on Twitter and on the official faculty feedback website Harvard established in wake of the report’s release. Lewis penned two scorching posts on his personal blog, writing that the ban smacks of “authoritarianism” and that the proposed approval mechanism “makes no sense.”
Lewis has been perhaps the most outspoken faculty detractor of the College’s attempts to regulate student participation in final clubs and Greek organizations. In May 2016, the same month Faust debuted the College’s social group sanctions, Lewis filed a Faculty motion designed to kill the proposed penalties.
Lewis withdrew his motion after the formation of the faculty committee. At the time, he wrote a letter to Faust and Khurana praising the new committee—but promised he would reintroduce his motion should the policy be “reaffirmed without adequate revision.”
Now, Lewis may follow through on his threat.
“I and a number of other faculty are discussing that motion and reintroducing it,” he said.

Dear Harvard students,
I don’t know if you’ve heard, but I got a B on my most recent EPA report card. I know it might be hard for a group of overachievers such as yourselves to understand getting anything below an A++, but please—just let me explain.
Consider my improvement over the years
The first grade the Environmental Protection Agency gave me in 1995 was a D, so I’m proud of how far I’ve come. I got my first B—meaning I “met standards for almost all boating and some swimming—in 2000, and in 2013 I even got an A-. For the past three years, I’ve gotten a B+.
So this year I lost my edge a little bit, I’ll admit, but is it really about any one year alone? If you employ a more holistic review process, you’ll see that I’ve made big strides. It’s about the journey, not the destination.
Compare me to other rivers in my class
The Potomac got a B- on its latest report card, so I think it’s important to remember that I’m not the only one struggling to get my grades up. Besides, hasn’t my filth always been just a little bit endearing? When you come across a river of questionable cleanliness in another city, you might just turn up your nose, but my “Dirty Water” is emblematic of the grit that makes Boston great.
Look beyond my report card
What does this grade even mean, really? OK, so I met the state’s bacterial water quality standards about 86% of the time for boating, and 55% of the time for swimming. Why should I let that define me? At the end of the day, I’m sure plenty of you are going to go for a dip off the Weeks Bridge or rent a kayak on the river this summer regardless.
Now that you know all these things, I hope you won’t be too dismissive of me for letting my score slip a little this year. Everyone’s grades take a hit at some point—the important thing is to just keep swimming.
Sincerely,
The Charles River
