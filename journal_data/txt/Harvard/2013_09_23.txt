After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What do "Dead Poets Society," "Die Hard," and "Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit" all have in common? Answer: you can hear Beethoven’s "Ode to Joy" in all of them. Directors have been relying on classical music since the invention of the silver screen. Even during classical's present decline in popularity, you'll rarely make it through a modern movie without hearing something Thomas Jefferson would've considered an oldie. Of course, with thousands of directors mining the classical archives for score material, some pieces are bound to pop up more than occasionally. Watch out for five of the most overused classical pieces in film:
“Ride of the Valkyries” by Richard Wagner
You can blame Francis Ford Coppola for this one. Ever since Colonel Kilgore blasted it during a napalm raid in “Apocalypse Now,” directors have been using this intro to Act III of Wagner’s “Die Valküre” whenever they want to say “Hey, what you’re about to see is violent, but it’s also kinda goofy if you think about it!” As a side note, Coppola wasn’t the first to use “Ride of the Valkyries”—D.W. Griffith used it in the climactic scene of his strongly pro-KKK 1915 film “Birth of a Nation.”
“String Quintet in E, Op. 11 No. 5 – Minuet” by Luigi Boccherini
Poor Boccherini. When he wrote “The Celebrated Minuet” back in 1771, how could he have known that it would turn in to the go-to piece for directors looking to make fun of classical music? You can hear the Minuet all over the place—as Ferris Bueller walks into a snooty Chicago restaurant, in “Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls,” and in both adaptations of “The Ladykillers.” It’s even in “D3: The Mighty Ducks,” for God’s sake. However, the song is brilliantly utilized in the form of a Nigel Tufnel guitar solo at the end of “Heavy Duty” in “This Is Spinal Tap,” the first (and last) time Boccherini gets turned up to 11.
“Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2” by Franz Liszt
Cartoon lovers just can’t get a break from the Hungarian virtuoso’s best-known work. Whether played by Bugs Bunny in “Rhapsody Rabbit” or Tom and Jerry in “The Cat Concerto,” this bouncy piano piece has accompanied more animated acts of violence than any other. It was also used by the Marx Brothers in their films and Robert Zemeckis in his classic “Who Framed Roger Rabbit.”
“Adagio in G Minor” by Tomaso Albinoni/Remo Giozatto:
If you haven’t heard of this piece, think of it as the Gov 1310 final take-home exam of classical music. The 20th century musicologist Remo Giozatto claimed to have transcribed the “Adagio” from a manuscript of the Baroque composer Tomaso Albinoni, but as it turns out, Giozatto wrote it all along. Scandalous, right? Either way, you’ve probably heard this piece at the movies more than you think: it’s been used to provide a dark setting for moody works such as “Rollerball” and “Welcome to Sarajevo.” Strangely enough, it also appeared in “Flashdance.”
“Orchestral Suite No. 3 (‘Air on the G String’)” by J.S. Bach
Sam Seaborn from “The West Wing” may have liked this piece just because of its title, but most directors like to use this serene work in movies that are far from peaceful, including “Collateral,” “Battle Royale,” and “Seven.” A secretary even gets fed to a shark with this Bach classic playing in the background in the James Bond flick “The Spy Who Loved Me.” Hey guys—we’ve all seen “A Clockwork Orange,” too. We get it.

 Had I read “Necessary Errors” a few months ago, I doubt I would have enjoyed it. The first novel by Caleb Crain ’89 joins the ever-populated genre of “young American traveling to a strange foreign country to have his first international experience.” In this case, said young American is Jacob—a gay aspiring writer—and the country in question a Czechoslovakia newly rid of communism. He is excited to witness the aftermath of a revolution, hoping even to find a gay revolution in its wake; instead, he suffers estrangement and disillusionment, as a perpetual outsider in both his nationality and sexual orientation.
 It is in this respect that one can most appreciate Crain’s novel. Unlike most other writers would do, he does not glorify Prague—indeed, it is easy to forget during the course of the novel that the city is, in reality, stunningly beautiful. He focuses instead on the queer loneliness of being away from home and at a linguistic and cultural disadvantage, and on the bizarre sensation of living through a long-term detour. Having just spent two months in Paris, I found Crain’s portrayal far more realistic than that of any other such novel—I recognized its accuracy in a way I could not have without having experienced it myself. In this regard alone, it is worthy of merit: it precisely and movingly hits on truth.
 Simultaneously, its structure is profoundly flawed, especially lacking in an effective dramatic arc. It was at times difficult to read through empty conversation after empty conversation without the satisfaction of plot or character progression. Most distinctly, Crain’s pacing is so disorganized it seems almost unplanned. The first third of the novel focuses largely on Jacob’s romance with Luboš, a Czech man he meets at the city’s lone gay bar not described as “rough” in his travel guide. Jacob ultimately learns that many of the gay men in Prague have turned to prostitution, his lover among them. The relationship ends, and the novel loses all the momentum it had gained: it essentially starts anew. The following section of the book is written artfully and elegantly as Jacob contemplates returning home and examines his American coins, “admir[ing] the burnt sienna patina of one of the pennies, which in the candlelight was iridescent with violet and green where people’s touch had salted it.” But now, bereft of any forward motion, the story cannot be sustained by such description and falls into unnecessary platitude. “It was easy to stay abroad,” Crain writes. “Jacob’s workload as a teacher was light, and in the hangover-Communist economy, it was no hardship to live on the salary.” The reader already knows this information, and Jacob’s long-winded, systematic thinking through his situation comes across as juvenile. As the victim of his pacing, Crain seems not to have a choice: such vapid lines are the sole way to keep his novel moving when he has obliterated its tension 150 pages in.
 The novel’s problematic rhythm manifests itself, too, on a more microscopic level: it exists as chunks of pure dialogue followed by chunks of pure introspection and description (much of it as banal as Jacob’s economic contemplations) that give one whiplash when they transition from one focus to the other. The components of these hairpin turns are not always bad, however, as Crain is quite a skilled writer of dialogue. What his characters say often feels slightly unrealistic, but amusingly. The character Melinda, a friend of Jacob, is particularly prone to this: she tells Jacob, “’You handle your liquor so well…you have the makings of a great alcoholic.” Crain has also mastered juggling bilingual dialogue. He sets off English with normal quotation marks, and Czech with dashes, as one would do in various European languages. This is remarkably successful: it renders the transition between languages legible and clear, and it allows the reader to easily follow Jacob’s increased fluency in Czech. Crain also lends the novel flavor by reflecting the patterns of Czech speech in its English representation—for example, he utilizes the word “thus” frequently to reflect the semantics of Czech. Linguistic difference is a powerful tool for expression in Crain’s hands, as when Jacob observes that “in Czech, missing had to be said in the third-person singular, like raining, and so Luboš didn’t seem to reveal as much by the confession as he would have in English.”
  It is in these regards, those of linguistic and cultural difference, of the sensation of being an expatriate and an other, that Crain is able to craft a novel that, ultimately, does rise above its multifarious problems. The immaturity of Crain’s structure does not fatally compromise the powerful and atypical depiction of Jacob’s situation. He shows Jacob to be sometimes awkward and alone, even among friends. “He had only himself for company,” Crain writes. “Sometimes he had the feeling, which one may have if one lives alone, that time had paused for him, though perhaps in this apartment only, as if, canoeing along Time, he had turned into a still inlet.”
  And so perhaps “Necessary Errors” is not the novel most would want to read. Its unrepentant defeat of the romanticism of the European adventure is at times brutal. But, as someone who has just recently experienced the perplexing loneliness and estrangement Crain depicts, I felt almost vindicated by the novel’s adherence to honest portrayal. Without such consistent realism, Crain could not have ended his novel as he did, with Jacob realizing, unexpectedly, the ties he has formed to Czechoslovakia. As he sits on the bus from Prague, overwrought with emotion, he thinks: “Now, […] now, now I know what it feels like to go into exile.”

Remember mixtapes? Crimson Arts does. Welcome to our new biweekly feature, where we create mixtapes for every emotion and every season—for breakups, breakdowns, and breakdancing. This week is our first ever Mixtape, inspired by the changing season and dedicated to staring out of windows and walking slowly down leafy streets.
 
“Oceans” by Coasts
As a Southern Californian venturing to the East for the first time, “Oceans” reminds me of all the warm beach days, late-night bonfires, sandy feet, and clear skies I left behind. As I wrap myself up in four layers each night (even though it’s only late September), Coasts’ single immediately takes me back to the blissful days of summer.

 
“I Already Forgot Everything You Said” by The Dig
The Dig’s relaxed, melodious song brings you back to the awkward summer flings to the best friends you left behind. Sometimes it’s necessary to just lay on your uncomfortable futon and stare at the ceiling, ear-buds in with sad music blasting—and this song allows you to do just that.

 
“Mushaboom” by Feist
"Mushaboom" opens with lilting tones over a spare guitar as Feist sings about being stuck between where you are and you want to be. As a sparking tambourine and whimsical handclaps join in, the song becomes a charming anthem for days when nothing feels quite as good as it should.
 
“Pompeii” by Bastille
The British band’s song may have taken over every radio station in the past few months, but justifiably so: “Pompeii” is absolutely fantastic, with upbeat chants throughout and cheerful lyrics about being optimistic in the moments when it seems hardest. If you ever feel sad or out-of-place in this changing season, the song will definitely lift your spirits up.

 
“Always Like This” by The Bombay Bicycle Club
The perfect summer song, with just the right amount of nostalgic punches thrown in between the random urges to dance, “Always Like This” never fails to make me happy, despite the cold despair I know I am about to feel (being a Californian and all).
 
"Alive” by Empire Of The Sun
Alive? Sure, but more like overdosed on coffee, problem sets, and homesickness. But when the heaps of illegible multivariable notes and Gov 20 readings on your nightstand get to be far too much, Empire of the Sun’s energetic and upbeat song will surely make you just a bit happier.
 
“Don’t Panic” by Coldplay
“Don’t Panic” allows me—at least for a good three minutes—to sit back and think about all that is going right when everything seems to go amiss. I’ll be honest: all I’ve done since my first day here is panic. From choosing the right classes to ignoring readings until the last minute, I’ve panicked about just about everything possible. Yet, amid my momentary existential crises, Coldplay’s bittersweet song gets me hopeful about all that I have to look forward to. 
 
 
“Summertime Sadness (Cedric Gervais remix)” by Lana Del Rey
Lana Del Rey’s single might have annoyed you on the radio during every single car ride this summer, but the upbeat and energetic Cedric Gervais remix will not fail to make you ironically happy as you think back to your own summertime sadness. The electronic feel of the remix, perfectly in unison with the song’s rhythm, will surely make you move in your seat.

 
“Featherstone” by The Paper Kites
“Featherstone” really sets the mood for the laid-back nights at Lamont, people-watching and avoiding the problem set that’s due in 4 hours. The song starts off with a relaxed guitar solo and eventually moves into backup vocals that echo the main ones, creating a lonely feeling. As a slow melody of drums joins in, it becomes jam-packed with nostalgia and transports you back to the simpler days of summer, when an all-nighter meant catching up with friends for hours.

 
“Love Like a Sunset Pt I and Pt II” by Phoenix
With seven minutes of instrumentals and nearly no audible lyrics, Phoenix really have a perfect song here: it allows you to simultaneously feel all emotions in the span of a few minutes, from hope to sadness to pure bliss.
 
“Venice” by The Lighthouse and the Whaler
The Lighthouse and the Whaler’s single, with its light, icy tones and airy vocals, gets me excited for the chilly days ahead. The beautiful melody and the upbeat vibe make me nostalgic of home, but also eager for the beautiful New England autumn ahead.

“Populaire,” a French import directed by Régis Roinsard, opens on a shot of a Triumph brand typewriter. It’s a prophetic visual: triumph is what’s in store for the film’s protagonist, and this typewriter is how she will get there. Set in 1958, this romantic comedy charts the transformation of Rose Pamphyle from naïve secretary to speed-typist extraordinaire, as well as her relationship with her boss and coach, Louis Échard. But there is more going on here than the relatively straightforward plot might suggest. Roinsard laces “Populaire” with serious themes that enable it to transcend its frothy exterior and makes it the rare film capable of leaving one both giggly and pensive.
 
The success of “Populaire” as a romantic comedy pivots, predictably, on the performances of its leads. Romain Duris and Déborah François are excellent as Échard and Pamphyle. Duris endows Louis with a quietly insecure, finicky physicality that prevents the character being steamrollered by the knight in shining armor archetype. François succeeds in her role by emphasizing Pamphyle’s flaws. She gives the impression that her character’s typing ability is more a fluke than a talent while emphasizing the character’s ignorance and ineptitude. Duris and François also excel as a pair. The chemistry between Échard and his protégé is redolent of “Pygmalion,” but not tritely so—imagine Henry and Eliza, with half the propriety and twice the innuendo.
 
Currents of obsoleteness and ephemerality run through “Populaire” like strips of gray hair in an otherwise blonde and perfectly coiffed bouffant. The film bristles with staples of the mid-20th-century: big-skirted dresses, snappy suits, idyllic two-child families, rooms filled with female job applicants who dream of marrying the man who hires them. But while Roinsard romanticizes these mores, he never lets his audience forget the quaint world it is ogling comes with an expiration date. When Pamphyle asks Échard to stop smoking at work, he retorts, “Only a law could stop me, pumpkin.” Further, the elements of the zeitgeist plumbed most thoroughly (the secretary as a figure of glamor, the sort of workplace romance that gets modern-day businessmen fired) are artfully overdone, such that their biggest impression is their impossibility today. 
 
The impermanence of the culture on display in “Populaire” is underscored by that of Pamphyle’s success. In a post-penmanship world, typing has lost its novelty. The audience doesn’t witness Rose’s descent, but can hardly fail to realize what the future has in store for her. The presumably brief tenure of Pamphyle’s celebrity is alluded to in a well-edited sequence in which a magician makes an actual rose (already fleeting) vanish into thin air.
 
Roinsard also explores the idea of the typewriter as an outlet and gateway to independence for mid-century women. Prior to the start of each speed-typing competition, an umpire-equivalent directs the typists to position their hands above “les claviers.” The word in this context refers to their typewriters, but can also mean piano. The double entendre is appropriate: her typewriter is the instrument through which timid, klutzy Pamphyle expresses herself. And the ability to type is what has enabled all of the women competing to support themselves, sans un homme. 
 
Rom-com underpinnings might have bogged down “Populaire,” but the film does a good job of not taking itself too seriously. Roinsard doesn’t expect the viewer to accept the gravitas “Populaire” heaps on speed-typing. He pokes fun at the less than earth-shattering nature of Rose’s ascent in a montage sequence, where she is seen running, Rocky style, through the pastoral rues of Lisieux, France. The comedic analogy continues when Rose enters the ring, competing in speed-typing competitions that grow progressively more prestigious. Roinsard presents these contests with as much pomp and circumstance as NBC does the Olympics. At the regional contest in Normandy, one eager participant affixes her machine to the table by means of a metal apparatus with adjustable screws. 
 
“Populaire” is not perfect. Roinsard seamlessly marries light comedy with thoughtful motifs, but stumbles when he tries to bring heated romance to the party. The two-minute scene that earns “Populaire” its R rating is not poorly executed, but comes absurdly out of nowhere. Bookended by successions of solid G-rated content, it is too much of an outlier to come across as anything but awkward. Roinsard also seems to lose control of his film in its final act. With 20 minutes to spare, the rom-com takes over, a coup that culminates in the insufferable one-liner “America for business, France for love.”
 
A groaner of this magnitude is bound to leave audiences with a bad taste in their mouths. But on the whole, corn does not epitomize “Populaire.” A more fitting alimentary analog is superior cotton candy: fluffy and saccharine, yet substantial enough to stick to your ribs. Bien fait, Monsieur Roinsard!

Since one of the most highly publicized mass school shooting, 14 years ago, at Colorado’s Columbine High School, Americans have been reminded time and again—most recently last week at Navy Yard—of the shift towards high casualty counts in American murders. The playbill of the American Theater Company’s performance of “columbinus”—a show exploring the mass shooting that took place in the Colorado high school in 1999—included a map of all school shootings in the U.S. since Columbine, the shockingly numerous dots like bullet holes through the country. Despite sometimes jarring stylistic shifts, “columbinus,” playing at the Emerson/Paramount Black Box theater until Saturday,  presents an emotionally honest and consistently engaging response to a tragic event, thanks to an often-brilliant conceptual script and emotional, generous performances by the two leads.
Writers P.J. Paparelli, who also directed the production, and Stephen Karam gave each act startlingly different stylistic ground, each beautiful and unique. The scenes moved from one to the next fluidly, and with the exception of the haphazard final act, were all deliberate and artistically pleasing. The first act was an examination of bullying and social pressures in high school largely devoid of gun violence in which actors play high-school archetypes. Strikingly distant late-1990s fashion, music, and slang pervade each vignette. Many moments, including a gorgeous scene in which actors pick totems representative of their respective stereotypes from suspended, backlit slabs to Gary Jules’s version of “Mad World,” are breathtaking. Other scenes, especially a prolonged interpolation of the “Romeo and Juliet” balcony scene between the “Freak” and the “Druggie,” seem more like slightly classier, R-rated versions of Degrassi.
Despite the sometimes cliché content, the first act never drags, as a result of the fascinating performances by Freak (Matthew Bausone) and Loner (Eric Folks). Initially sympathetic, Freak, whose laconic cadence and pent-up artistic passion evoke a young Jeff Bridges, and Loner, a frenetic hot temper, fall ever further into thoughts of revenge against their popular tormentors. By the middle of the act, it becomes apparent that, in contrast to the intentionally two-note performances of their archetypal cohorts, Bausone and Folks are embracing deep subtlety in their characters. Especially compelling is Loner’s attempt to ask the Christian girl, Faith (Leah Raidt), to prom. Alternately charming and brutal in his flirtation, Folks perfectly captures the swings of his character’s anti-social personality. After the eventual rejection by Faith, Loner unleashes a sexually violent tirade full of shockingly kinetic rage.
Paparelli and Karam elegantly write the anonymous characters to take on identities by the end of the act. Loner and Freak start making pipe bombs, communicating angrily over IM, and openly discussing killing their bullies and others at the school. Despite the namelessness of the characters, it becomes increasingly apparent that they the two aren’t just Loner and Freak, but rather Columbine shooters Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris. Such a device works brilliantly at stopping initial prejudice against the duo. For much of the act, their grievances and anger seem overblown, but by no means psychotic, and their moments of discourse and friendship are enough to make them somewhat endearing. Thus, it is horrifying when they embrace truly homicidal mentalities in a series of highly surrealist scenes including an “Anarchist Cookbook” bomb-making show.
Surrealism and superfluity vanish at the outset of act two. A largely verbatim documentation of the few nights preceding the killing and the massacre itself, the act uses 911 records and home videos by the killers to construct a realistic retelling. Avoiding the sensationalism that they slip into at points in the first half, Paparelli and Karam stage the shooting tastefully. Klebold and Harris tote their weapons and stalk the library, but instead of actually shooting, they indicate murders by slapping the blackboard at the back of the room. The victims and hostages describe their actions in the past tense while sitting on chairs and lying under tables in the library where the killers carried out much of their carnage. The authenticity and leanness of the act maximize emotional impact. After Klebold and Harris shoot themselves in the head and the lights come up, the entire theater is silent for several minutes.
The last act is disappointing compared with the rest of the show. Each actor, excepting the shooters, plays several roles, and besides an astonishing cross-dressing portrayal of a victim’s aunt by standout first-act Jock (Jerry MacKinnon), there is too much character saturation. Despite the failure of the act, the overall punch of the play remains, with the names and faces of the victims projected onto the back wall of the stage at the show’s conclusion.
Given the sensitive nature of the material, it is particularly bold for a theater production to attempt to show Columbine’s violent scenes, but because of tasteful decisions on the part of the playwrights and the unavoidable confrontation with evil that “columbinus” affords, the production certainly qualifies as a riveting night.

The Middle East is hardly a model of stability. Civil wars, bloody suppressions, and international conflicts seem par for the course. However, the past few years have seen an increase in violent struggles in the region. And these recent upheavals are harbingers of future Mideast chaos, caused in part by the decreasing global importance of oil. An isolationist shift in American foreign policy, excepting only Israel, will exacerbate this trend toward regional destabilization.
The most lasting change may be the global shift of nonrenewable resources. Saudi Arabia is no longer the world’s largest producer of oil—Russia has surpassed it, and the US is a close third, expected to exceed even Russia’s production by the end of the decade. And this does not take into account the increasing role of natural gas, which is disproportionately produced by Russia and the United States. Iran, the world’s third-largest supplier of natural gas, produces less than a quarter of US output. With the gradual transition to alternative energy sources and the increased use of natural gas, oil revenue will not flow into the Middle East like it used to. Dictators from Saudi Arabia to Iran to Qatar will find themselves without the guaranteed flow of wealth that has for decades propped up their regimes.
Add the diminished role of the U.S. to dwindling oil revenues and mix thoroughly with the globalizing forces of this century, specifically the Internet and telecommunications. Now sprinkle the mixture on one of the most historically combustible regions of the globe, replete with autocracy, theocracy, and centuries-old religious feuds. Add yeast, let sit for a decade.
What we are likely to get is, put simply, chaos.
Chaos in the Middle East is hardly a novel thought. But it is almost certain to get worse over the coming decades, in an ongoing process that may have begun with the so-called Arab Spring. We saw demonstrations, protest suppressions, civil wars, and regime changes. As the dictators who cling to power lose their source of funding, the process will only accelerate. If American isolationism deepens, our pseudo-involvement in the Syrian conflict may be the swan song of an era defined by international concern regarding Middle Eastern geopolitics. Someday, perhaps someday soon, the West might simply not care about the Middle East. Protecting the Persian Gulf may not be in our strategic interests, propping up the Saud regime not our agenda.
Such a world hardly seems far off in a day and age when most of the West simply ignores the overt use of chemical weapons by a dictator against his own people. Yes, the situation is complicated. Yes, there is a civil war. But no nation seems to care to enforce international norms regarding warfare or morality. Obama drew a red line, and now declines to enforce it, instead hitching his presidency on the prayer that Vladimir Putin delivers on his plans and collects all of Syria’s chemical weapons, despite reports that the chemical arsenal is already scattered across the country.
Some insist that the diminished influence of foreign factors will allow residents of the Middle East to develop their own systems of government and finally promote peace in the region. They are wrong. True, America has not always been a stabilizing force. But Iraq and Iran needed no foreign instigation to go to war in the 1980s; Syria wasn’t exactly a halcyon nation before Putin and Obama began meddling in the conflict. Without the U.S. propping up Mubarak, Egypt would likely have fallen into civil war decades ago. The same goes for Saudi Arabia, where the Saud regime would be long out of power without petrodollars.
The more optimistic among us hope that the very factors which are destabilizing the region can ultimately foster democracy. After all, without American intervention and Western demand for foreign oil, perhaps grassroots movements will take advantage of interconnectivity and social media to foster a civil society. Egypt was an ideal test case for this optimistic spirit: A dictator was overthrown and elections were held. What ensued, though, was a blossoming theocracy nipped in the bud by a bloody military coup. And even Libya is rife with militias wreaking havoc. So sure, maybe democracy will follow the absence of foreign influences. But I certainly wouldn’t hold my breath.
How the region will look in 50 years is anyone’s guess. Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, a former Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates, reportedly had his own timeline: “My grandfather rode a camel, my father rode a camel, I drive a Mercedes, my son drives a Land Rover, his son will drive a Land Rover, but his son will ride a camel.” And once the US can fuel its own fleet of Mercedes and Land Rovers, we will have no interest in camels. Like it or not, chaos will fill the power void.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Early this year, Nate Silver wore a halo. Having called 50 of 50 states correctly in November’s election, Silver was declared the true winner of the presidential race and even the staunchest of realists were starting to suspect there might be some supernatural forces on his side. His 1.000 batting average helped maintain his book’s best-seller status, drove unprecedented traffic to the New York Times website’s politics section, and won him the uncontested title of America’s favorite statistician.
So why did he leave for ESPN?
The unexpected move was retroactively attributed to a number of potential causes. Maybe his dry, statistical, Billy Beane approach to politics didn’t mesh with the Times’s journalistic standards. Maybe he wanted the Grantland-esque freedom to realize his own creative vision. Or maybe he really just wanted to reconnect with his first love, sports.
While any of these reasons may be valid, I suspect there’s another reason Silver ditched his established spot in the limelight. And I suspect there’s only one publication that covered the move to ESPN from the right angle.
That publication is The Onion.
The article was titled “Nate Silver Warns Against Overestimating His Value To ESPN” and, as is standard for The Onion, its content can be entirely inferred from the headline. Though the authors had satirical intentions, they hit the nail on the head: Realizing he couldn’t replicate his 2012 feat, Silver quit the world of punditry while he was ahead.
Yes, Silver will continue to be a better predictor than a TV pundit. Are you surprised? Statistics will consistently score higher than gut feelings. But it’s not magic.
There are two reasons Silver can’t throw a perfect game again in 2016. The first is regression to the mean: Whenever someone does very well in any context, part of his success is due to luck and he probably won’t do as well next time. Regression to the mean is the reason the Colts are favored to win 8.5 games this season after their 11-5 record last year. It’s the reason an artist with a fantastic debut album never meets expectations with her second release. It’s the reason educators often believe the proverbial carrot is less effective than the proverbial stick, since students do worse after doing well (whether or not they were lauded) and do better after doing poorly (whether or not they were punished). Regression to the mean is the reason for the sophomore slump, the Sports Illustrated cover jinx, the Madden curse—all names given to imaginary causal explanations for a counterintuitive universal truth. And it’s one reason Silver won’t predict all 50 states next time.
The second reason is that his model secretly isn’t that great. It’s miles above anything out of a pundit’s mouth, but as far as statistical models go it’s needlessly complex. This allows him to overfit to past results and dilute the actually important variables.
Silver has a history of developing exceedingly complicated statistical models: He first became famous for the baseball prediction model PECOTA, described by its inheritors as “large, complex, and full of creaky interactions and pinch points.” While it’s still considered state-of-the-art, it only performs marginally better than Marcel, a “Monkey Forecasting System” you can carry out with pen and paper, designed to represent an absolute baseline level of competence.
So how does Silver’s FiveThirtyEight model compare to the simple models of the presidential forecasting world? Not favorably. Political scientist Drew Linzer built a statistical model based only on approval rating adjusted by state polls, and it blew Silver out of the water. While Silver’s November 6 forecast showed a 70 percent chance of Obama victory and an expected electoral vote count of 313, Linzer predicted Obama’s win with 99 percent certainty and correctly called the 332-206 result—wait for it—in June!
But Silver is far smarter than I’ve given him credit for. He knows what regression to the mean is, and he has acknowledged that his model is center-skewed compared to other statisticians’. And that’s why he’s off to ESPN.
He did what no other poll-watcher could do: He made statistics cool. He explained himself. He made nice charts and compelling visuals. He was hailed as a nerd demigod and a rock star. His legacy is not an impressive election prediction. His legacy is a new wave of election-followers dedicated to realism over sensationalism, and he doesn’t want to tarnish it by showing them the other end of the bell curve.
Nate Silver knows that 2016 can only hurt his pristine reputation. That’s why he’s done the mainstream media one last favor, by leaving it behind.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A week ago, I strolled into the Cabot House servery, surveyed my culinary options, and loaded my tray with the kind of scrumptious feast only HUDS can provide: bulgar wheat pilaf, whole wheat spaghetti drenched in creamy parmesan pesto, roasted summer squash, and a small piece of chicken française.
One of these things is not like the others. In fact, for over two years before that fateful day, one of these things never would have found its way onto my plate at all.
That’s because, on December 31, 2010, I resolved to fight against my carnivorous nature and become a vegetarian. It struck many of my friends—and all of my family—as odd that I, an avid eater, a girl who lives from meal to meal, had given up the most delicious and nutritious food known to man. Perhaps that was what inspired everyone with whom I shared the news to ask some variation of a short but not so simple question: “Why?”
Why, indeed? Of course, I felt compelled to provide a clever, or at least thoughtful, answer. I needed the world to understand that my motivation for swearing off steak stemmed from something profound.
So I settled on an explanation: An everyday action like ordering a grilled portabella sandwich over a tender veal cutlet, I said, acted as a wake-up call. It reminded me that I am constantly required to choose between my own desires and some greater cause—that I’m capable of making ethical decisions and should always be on the lookout to do what’s right.
I listened to myself wax eloquent about my herbivorous habits and watched my acquaintances nod in sage approval. Molly Roberts, paragon of meatless morality. Wasn’t it pretty to think so? But the truth—well, the truth was harder to stomach than poorly prepared tempeh.
Though it pains me to admit it, I went vegetarian for one reason and one reason alone: Unrequited love. I will not waste time or space regaling readers with tales of my high school romances (or lack thereof). I forswore meat to charm my crush, who had made the transition months before. Suffice it to say, I did not succeed in winning his heart.
Now that I’ve completed the 360-degree trajectory to vegetarianism and back again, I once more face the dreaded, “Why?” And once more, I struggle to reply. First, symmetry: A boy turned me vegetarian, and a pact—whose details I will not disclose—with another spurred me to head back to what I used to call the dark side. But this young man did not dictate my decision; he only inspired me to consider the soundness of my logic. It turned out that logic wasn’t very sound at all.
What was keeping me a vegetarian? A deep-seated conviction that killing animals violated some abstract code of decency? Not really. A belief that I could single-handedly save the environment by boycotting industrial agriculture? If only it were so. A hope that cutting fatty foods from my diet would improve my health? Possible, but I tend to carbo-load even more with other options off the table. The single thing keeping me a vegetarian, I realized, was nothing more than habit: Munching on tofu had become as reliable a part of my daily routine as showering and brushing my teeth.
Am I worse person now for having thrown vegetarianism to the wayside? I’d like to think that, in the end, it matters less what I do or do not eat and more that I understand why I do or do not eat it. College, many claim, offers an opportunity for personal transformation. We leave our old lives behind and, as we prepare for new ones, we change. It seems there’s no better time, then, to reevaluate our choices. Some may still fit neatly into our lives. But others may have fallen out of sync with who we are today.
Or maybe I’m just rationalizing. Maybe this time is no different than the last. Maybe I just really like a guy who likes a good burger.

John Harvard would be surprised that nearly four centuries after his generous gift, Harvard University has 21,000 students across 12 schools. He would be shocked at the $30.7 billion endowment. He would not be able to grasp the cutting-edge research, innovation, and learning happening both in Cambridge and across the river. He could not have known then what Harvard is now, much as we do not know now what Harvard will be in another 400 years.
The launch of the public phase of the capital campaign is an opportunity to reflect on the big questions that face Harvard. What should residential education look like as online education becomes more popular? How do we renew our Houses, both physically and culturally? How do we make a Harvard education available to every student who has earned admission? These questions and many others will drive our institution for the foreseeable future. Harvard needs our support, and it needs it now. The Harvard Campaign is an ambitious undertaking that is both urgent and inspiring.
The Harvard Campaign is urgent because the higher education landscape is shifting faster than ever. Nearly all of our peer schools have completed or announced a capital campaign since our last effort ended in 1999. This campaign was delayed by the financial crisis in 2008, and it is now overdue. The delay had ramifications: Today, the Houses are in desperate need of renewal and Harvard's vision for Allston has been on pause for too long. At the same time, federal budget pressures are eating away at the 16 percent of our operating budget that comes from federal research money. Harvard cannot merely maintain the status quo. The best students and teachers in the world are here, but our competition would pull them away given the chance. Harvard has to keep moving forward to stay ahead.
But this campaign is also about new initiatives and a vision for One Harvard. The campaign will support each of Harvard’s schools, but it will also bring Harvard together. Whether it is through common spaces like the recently announced campus center or through new support for interdisciplinary, collaborative work, the capital campaign will support a more united Harvard. The goals for the campaign are big ideas: “advancing the power of integrated knowledge,” “advancing innovation and hands-on discovery,” and “advancing new approaches to learning and teaching,” just to name a few. The campaign’s aspirations challenge Harvard to evolve into a university prepared to thrive in a changing world.
It is up to all of us—students, faculty, staff, and alumni—to support Harvard. Those who can should give and give generously. Those of us who are students should give, even if the donation is small. Giving to Harvard means that a donation today will still be making a meaningful change in someone’s life in 100 years. It is an investment in transforming talented students into extraordinary people.
The goal of the capital campaign is to raise $6.5 billion. We hope that by the end of the campaign, Harvard will have not only exceeded its goals but also will have developed as an institution. We hope that we will be further along in answering the big questions about the future of education and the role of a place like Harvard in a digital and interconnected world. This campaign is as much about institutional introspection as fundraising success.
University President Drew G. Faust said it best:
“May Harvard be as wise as it is smart,
as restless as it is proud,
as bold as it is thoughtful,
as new as it is old,
as good as it is great.”

Midway through the 30th annual Allston Village Street Fair on Sunday, runners from across the city participating in the Brian J. Honan 5k race sprinted along the outskirts of the festival in an unusual twist for the yearly event.
The multicultural fair brought together not only the city’s running enthusiasts, but also residents from Allston-Brighton, Cambridge, Boston, and Brookline, filling the streets between Brighton Avenue and Cambridge Street with a variety of culinary, shopping, and entertainment booths.
Runners who finished the race took the opportunity to enjoy the festivities going on in the area, which included street performers, moon castles, and face painting for children.
For University accountant Robert Breslin, this meant that he could go to the two events on the same day, having attended both in the past.
While the race usually does not coincide with the Allston festival, their connection this year was not limited to their location. The run was sponsored by Harvard Public Affairs and Communications and Harvard Business School, and a total of 569 runners from the Harvard community registered to participate.
The Harvard University Band also marched during a mid-festival parade.
Though the morning began with light rain, the weather gave in to sunnier skies and warmer temperatures, making the fair a more pleasant experience for some attendees.
“It was relaxing and fun to walk around and see all the different vendors,” Melanie M. Slone ’17 said. “If it had been any colder or raining, I’m sure the turnout would not have been as large.”
In addition to hosting a variety of street performers, some of which can regularly be seen in the Square, the fair also featured music performances by local rappers and bands. Those looking for a bite to eat could stop by the international food market or one of the many booths selling food from around the world—from barbecue to Chinese to Indian.
Paul Cantillon, a marketing manager for the beverage company Izze, said the event’s large crowds create a great opportunity for vendors.
“You have time for good consumer interactions, and really connect with the people attending,” Cantillon said.

The restaurant and concert venue Beat Hôtel is now open at 13 Brattle St., bringing live music, colorful décor, and a taste of “la vie bohème” to Harvard Square.
Led by the same team that operates The Beehive in Boston’s South End, the Beat Hôtel draws inspiration from a rundown hotel in Paris that housed numerous writers and artists of the so-called Beat Generation during the 1950s and ’60s, according to Jack Bardy, Beat Hôtel’s operating partner.
“The idea behind it is something that’s fitting for Cambridge, Harvard Square, and the community,” said Bardy, adding that the venue’s “hippy-bohemian” ambiance compliments the Square’s tone.
The 360-capacity restaurant, which replaced The Tannery’s underground location, held a soft opening on Sept. 12, as Bardy said he did not want to open with a lot of fanfare.
“We’re planning on being there a very long time, so we’re taking a strong, methodical approach to opening,” Bardy said.
According to Bardy, the American brasserie serves “wholesome, approachable food,” whether it is a snack at one of the two bars or a full meal in the dining room or private dining space. The menu includes vegan options.
Beat Hôtel joins the musical ranks of the long-standing Club Passim and fellow newcomer The Sinclair in Harvard Square.
With a September lineup including Benny Benson and Zap, Oscar Stagnaro Latin Band, Sarah Brindell, and a Coltrane tribute, Bardy said that the uniqueness of Beat Hôtel stems from its integration of music into the restaurant’s atmosphere.
“Our main focus is to have the most innovative, cutting-edge, serious musicians in most any genre,” he said. While the venue primarily seeks to bring in jazz and blues artists, Bardy added that if the music is not too overwhelming and “if it’s fitting for our atmosphere, we’ll do it.”
Launching the Beat Hôtel fulfills a longtime dream of Bardy’s to open a place in Harvard Square that would appeal to its diverse crowd.
Beat Hôtel is currently open daily at 5 p.m.,with music starting around 8 p.m., and serves only dinner and drinks. But, Bardy noted that the venue might eventually be open for breakfast and lunch as well.
Bruce Ferrara, music director of The Beehive and of the new Harvard Square location, told The Crimson last October that he believed Harvard Square’s vibrancy has declined over the recent decades, and that he hoped the new venue will help support the return of a thriving music culture.

Students, faculty, and members of the Cambridge community filled the Carpenter Center auditorium on Friday evening for a screening of Alfred Hitchcock’s “Strangers on a Train,” part of a three-month series at the Harvard Film Archive entitled “The Complete Alfred Hitchcock.”
The retrospective, which includes new restorations of Hitchcock’s first nine silent films as well as better-known classics such as “Psycho” and “Birds,” has attracted film enthusiasts from across the Boston area, including high schoolers and students from neighboring universities.
Joshua L. H. Weiner, a senior at Tufts, attended the screening to complement a class he is currently taking on Hitchcock’s films.
“This is my favorite of the Hitchcock films I’ve seen,” Weiner said.
As fewer theaters now feature classic films, audience members on Friday seized the opportunity to view Hitchcock’s work on the big screen.
“Any time I get to see [Hitchcock] in a theater, I have to take advantage of it,” said Katrina Jazeyeri, a Somerville resident.
“A lot of these films haven’t been shown in Boston or Cambridge in a few years,” said David W. Pendleton, the programmer at the Harvard Film Archive who arranged the screenings.
“I love Hitchcock, so when I heard this was going on, I thought I would definitely come,”  Rachel A. Orol ’15 said. A first-time visitor to the archives, Orol remarked that it was “an ideal way to spend an evening.”
Pendleton said that he enjoyed passing on to the next generation “the idea of what it’s like to watch a film on 35 millimeter on the big screen.”
The program was motivated by the British Film Institute’s restoration of some of Hitchcock’s earliest works, which has drawn renewed excitement around Hitchcock’s films. Although the director’s nine silent films are less well known, they represent some of the greatest achievements in early British cinema.
Pendleton said that “The Complete Alfred Hitchcock” plays into the mission of the Harvard Film Archive to “encourage people to take film seriously…as works of art.” In the past few years, the Archive has featured programs that highlighted other directors and plans to continue to do so.
This series comes to an end next weekend, with the showings of “Suspicion” and “Shadow of a Doubt” on Friday and Saturday, respectively.
The Harvard Film Archive is also currently showing a series entitled “Nuove Visioni: Italian Cinema Now” that will continue through the end of September.
The archive plans to switch gears in October, when it will feature several documentaries, including a few non-fiction films by director Chris Marker.

University administrators officially approved the creation of a centralized Student Information System, which will allow students from across 12 Harvard schools to complete tasks ranging from submitting study cards to handling billing payments, all on one online platform.
According to Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Michael P. Burke, the project was presented before University leadership last May, at which point administrators officially green-lighted the development of the new platform.
Burke predicted the potential for visible progress on the system by the end of the fall semester, but said that the process would take years to complete due to the complexity of the system.
“You’re not just creating a mobile app with one or two functions; you’re creating a sophisticated system that does hundreds of functions and abides by federal regulations while meeting the needs of all the schools,” Burke said.
Besides study cards and billing, students will also be able to access their advising portal on the system, while professors will be able to submit grades. Several other functionalities meeting the individual needs of each school will also be added.
“The system will have a customized user experience for students,” Burke said.
The project was first proposed by the FAS Registrar’s office in 2011, and official approval for the creation of this system followed the year-long work of a steering committee, which presented the final proposal to administrators this past April. The committee was comprised of deans and faculty, and was co-chaired by Burke and Anne H. Margulies, University Chief Information Officer.
Burke said that members of the steering committee attended several meetings with administrators from the participating Harvard schools to ensure the adaptability and efficacy of the platform. From this point forward, software engineer company Oracle will oversee system creation, while a University-wide working group composed partly of HUIT staff will be created to support the platform.
The creation of the SIS is one among several University-led measures working towards “One Harvard,” a theme which has been central to University President Drew G. Faust’s administrative goals.
“There are two main reasons for this system,” Burke said. “First, we’re at the point where our current Student Information System is out-of-date and we have to replace it. Second, the University values that we don’t have to do this separately. It feeds into the idea of ‘One Harvard.’”

William Cooper ’94, who served as a freshman resident dean for seven years, has joined the Office of Student Life, where he will work with other administrators on Harvard’s more than $1 billion House renewal project.
Cooper fills the role of associate dean of student life, which was left vacant when Kimberly A. Pacelli departed for Bowdoin College over the summer. According to Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde, between 100 and 200 applicants sought the position.
In his new role, Cooper said he will assist Lassonde in supporting the Houses, which includes working with the Office of Physical Resources on House renewal plans. He called the project one of his top priorities. 
Cooper will also facilitate the Harvard College Safety Committee. 
Cooper began working at the OSL last month on freshman move-in day, which he called his “own move-in day.” 
“Over the last four weeks...I’ve had a lot to learn, even though I know Harvard well from other contexts,” Cooper said during an interview in his office on Friday. 
“In a sense, my move-in day—freshman move-in day—has been almost...a period of discovery for me in the same way that a new student to Harvard would have that period of time, in a sense.”
Lassonde, who joined the OSL in March, praised Cooper for his knowledge of Harvard and the relationships he already has built at the College and University from his previous work. 
“[The relationships he has are] really helpful to me, because I’m still new,” said Lassonde, who previously worked at Brown.
Cooper highlighted his past experience at the College serving as a freshman proctor and resident dean. Throughout his time at Harvard, Cooper said he has lived in Thayer, Holworthy, Pennypacker, Wigglesworth, and Apley Court freshman dorms. He also lived, as an undergraduate, in Kirkland House, where current Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister was House master. 
“I have experience in the Yard and the Houses as in real life,” Cooper said. “That is to say not just [as] floor plans or spreadsheets or numbers, but as a place where I’ve lived.” 
Reflecting on his move from the FDO to University Hall, Cooper said he will assume more administrative responsibilities, in addition to other changes. 
“It’s nice to have new challenges,” Cooper said. “It’s one of the things I like about my new role...that there are things I don’t know very well, and that I have to learn about.”

Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith met with Undergraduate Council representatives for an hour-long meeting Sunday morning, seeking out UC feedback as he leads the search for a permanent Dean of the College.
According to UC Vice President Jen Q. Zhu ’14, Smith started the meeting with a brief introduction before soliciting suggestions from UC representatives about qualities they would like to see in the new Dean of the College.
“They wanted an approachable, trustworthy, proactive Dean of the College,” Zhu said, broadly summarizing various recommendations UC representatives offered.
Smith was joined by professors David I. Laibson ’88, Elena M. Kramer, and N. Gregory Mankiw, members of the newly created search committee advising Smith in the search, and by FAS Dean for Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser.
Many representatives said they wanted to ensure that the next Dean of the College would take student initiatives and ideas seriously.
“We want someone who would respect our ideas and not try to wait it out, you know, just because we’re here for four years and administrators are here for longer,” said Kirkland representative and UC Secretary Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16.
According to Quincy representative Brett M. Biebelberg ’16, Smith made “very clear” that there is no timeline for the search and, although the committee is looking for a dean that “understands Harvard,” they are not limiting their search to senior faculty.
Emphasizing their willingness to consider a wide variety of individuals for the position, Smith and the committee members asked representatives to suggest anyone who they would like to see in the position. Lowell co-House master Diana L. Eck, who is also a professor of comparative religion and Indian studies; government professor Steven R. Levitsky; and Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 were among the faculty members and administrators that representatives suggested as good candidates, according to a UC member who asked to be unnamed to avoid the appearance of endorsing a candidate.
Council representatives said they appreciated Smith and other faculty members reaching out to the UC for feedback.
“I was pleasantly surprised by how genuinely interested those five people were,” Biebelberg said. “They demonstrated, above and beyond, their genuine interest and concern in finding a dean who would meet the characteristics that students were looking for.”
The search for a new Dean of the College was set into motion after Smith announced in May that Evelynn M. Hammonds would step down over the summer after five years as dean. Hammonds’s resignation followed revelations that administrators had conducted secret searches of the email accounts of resident deans in connection with the Government 1310 cheating scandal. Botany professor Donald H. Pfister was appointed as interim Dean of the College in July.

As Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, the Harvard-affiliated teaching hospital, gains support for its proposed acquisition of Jordan Hospital in Plymouth, officials from both hospitals are addressing concerns about potential layoffs.
Some employees at the 155-bed Jordan Hospital have voiced concerns about possible layoffs as a result of the merger and asked for unambiguous guarantees by BIDMC that all necessary services currently in place would stay in place, according to a report in WickedLocal.
Representatives from both BIDMC and Jordan Hospital told The Crimson that their hospitals are working to allay those concerns.
“We are ready to have a public hearing at the Public Health Council and address any issues that may arise. Our decisions will be made according to what the regulatory authority deems appropriate,” said BIDMC spokesperson Jerry Berger.
Jordan Hospital spokesperson Christopher Smalley provided a stronger response.
“The alliance with BIDMC will not cause any change in our staffing patterns,” said Smalley. “The purpose of the alliance is to enhance and expand the services that we have and hopefully introduce more services. Additional services mean more patients, and more patients also mean more opportunities for employment.”
Earlier this month, the state Health Policy Commission deemed the acquisition unlikely to drive up medical costs in Plymouth and Barnstable counties, a key step in the regulatory process required before the deal can be closed, according to the Boston Globe.
Jordan Hospital initially sought a merger due to challenges that emerged as a result of recent health reforms.
“We recognized that in order to compete with peers and provide better care for the community, we had to align with a very strong medical center,” Smalley said.
Jordan Hospital settled on BIDMC after receiving a number of bids, Smalley said. He cited BIDMC’s resources and connection to Harvard Medical School as reasons to merge with the hospital.
“After a nine-month due diligence process, we decided that a merger with BIDMC will not only benefit our hospital but our community,” he said. Due to confidentiality agreements, Smalley would not share the names of the unsuccessful bidders.
For BIDMC, the merger presented an opportunity to partner with a quality hospital in a nearby community.
The Harvard-affiliated teaching hospital already operates community hospitals in Milton and Needham. Berger said he believes that the merger will improve care at Jordan without affecting operations at BIDMC “in any great measure.”
The final decision on the merger will be made at the Public Health Council in October, but Smalley said he is optimistic that it will happen.
“We look forward to being part of the BIDMC. We think Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center is a great organization which will provide great opportunities for our patients,” he said.

Boston Police Commissioner Edward F. Davis is expected to announce his resignation Monday, the Boston Globe reported Sunday evening. Davis will assume a fellowship with Harvard’s Institute of Politics, according to the Globe.
Sources close told the Globe that Davis will teach and take classes from his position at Harvard as he considers other career options.
According to the Boston Police Department website Davis will hold a press conference at the Boston police headquarters at 10 a.m. Monday to “discuss [his] future plans.”
Mayor Thomas M. Menino appointed Davis as police commissioner in October 2006. Before that, Davis had served for 12 years as the superintendent of police in Lowell, Mass.
Davis has been praised for his handling the Boston Marathon bombings in April 2013, an event which came at the tail-end of his seven-year tenure.
During the April 19 manhunt for Cambridge residents Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, Davis, together with Menino and Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78, announced a city-wide lockdown. Davis was praised by figures like former Harvard professor and current Senator Elizabeth Warren for his confident leadership during the crisis.
But Davis’s tenure has not been free of controversy. The Massachusetts Association of Minority Law Enforcement Officers has criticized his time as commissioner as marked by a failure to promote qualified minority officers and lacking a strong commitment to diversity. The group asked for Davis to resign through a vote of no-confidence in early August.
Davis’s resignation comes six months after Menino’s announcement that he will not seek sixth term in office. Davis worked closely with the mayor throughout his time as commissioner.
“He views himself as a team with the mayor,” a source told the Globe. “In the past couple of weeks he just felt like it was time.”

UPDATED: Sept. 24, 2013, at 3:37 a.m.
In this year’s Undergraduate Council general election, it would have taken a total of just three votes to be elected as an Eliot House representative, and only four to earn a seat in Cabot House. But with an unprecedented tie in the UC’s voting history, four candidates who fell short of these thresholds remain in electoral limbo.
The general election results, announced Sunday, left 44 of 46 seats filled, according to Sahil A. Khatod ’14, head of the UC Election Commission.
Tyler R. Kugler ’15 and Ved V. Topkar ’16 of Eliot House tied with two votes each, while Connor B. Hinebaugh ’15 and Serguei Balanovich ’16 of Cabot House each received three votes, according to Kirkland representative and UC Secretary Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16. All four were write-in candidates.
According to Kanuparthy, neither the body’s constitution nor its bylaws nor the 2013 election rules released by the Commission state a procedure for what should be done in the case of a tie, leaving the UC and the Election Commission without any procedural guidance.
On Monday, the UC sent an email to the student body saying that the ties would be resolved via a runoff vote during Sunday’s UC general meeting.
The 2013 general election also marked a high for gender parity on the Council—an issue that the historically male body has worked to address in recent years.
Forty-six percent of newly elected representatives are female, a modest increase from the 42 percent of those elected in last year’s general election and the 33 percent of those elected two years ago.
In total following the election, women now hold 24 of 51, or roughly 47 percent, of seats on the UC, including the positions of President and Vice President.
In total, 86 students declared their candidacy last week for the 46 spots open on the Council this year. While most races were relatively uncontested, freshmen made up more than half of this year’s candidates.
Juan P. Castano ’17, who ran against 13 other freshmen to win one of three representative spots for Elm Yard, described the competitive nature of his election as “daunting.”
“I guess it just motivated me more to try to work harder in terms of my campaign and it pushed me to go door to door,” Castano said.
UC Vice President Jennifer Q. Zhu ’14 said that while it takes time for any new Council to “get used to the way Harvard works as an institution,” she expects big things from the coming year.
“Tara and I are just ready to push for important conversations from last semester, we’ve set some of our priorities and we’re ready to make progress,” Zhu said. “We’re excited by all the new blood and also by all the UC reps who’ve returned.”
The full election results are as follows:

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Elif Yavuz, a 2013 graduate of Harvard School of Public Health, was among dozens killed in a terrorist attack that began Saturday in Nairobi, Kenya, according to a statement by HSPH Dean Julio Frenk on the school’s website.
Yavuz, 33, and her partner were two of the victims who were killed when masked gunmen attacked civilians at the upscale Westgate shopping mall. The militant Somali group al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the violence.
Yavuz, a Netherlands native who graduated from HSPH’s Department of Global Health and Population, had been working as a senior vaccines researcher for the Clinton Health Access Initiative. She was pregnant and expecting her first child in early October.
Harvard community members remembered the victims of the attack at a Monday evening vigil in front of Memorial Church.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s tennis team continued its strong fall season this weekend at the Ivy Plus Invitational in New Haven, where the Crimson had multiple players win their respective singles and doubles flights.
The team, which will aim for its third-straight Ivy League crown in the spring, commenced its fall season last weekend with an impressive showing against top-ranked teams at the Harvard Chowder Fest.
“Everyone is really happy with the weekend,” junior Alex Steinroeder said. “The guys were a little tired from last weekend, but we came back and I thought that everyone was really impressive; especially the freshmen.”
At this weekend’s tournament, Harvard got its first look at its Ancient Eight competition this year, with the exception of Princeton, which finished tied for second in the conference last season.
“It was good to get to see the other Ivy League teams this early in the year,” junior Shaun Chaudhuri said. “It’s fun to see how they look, and to see their new faces.”
In addition to the Ivy teams, the tournament also featured Old Dominion, Army, Binghampton, Marist, St. Johns, and UNC-Wilmington.
The tournament was conducted in a format different from the more team-oriented regular-season matches. The Ivy Plus Invitational was set up in a traditional individual tournament draw, divided up into six different flights.
The Crimson managed to post a successful showing in doubles, despite trying out several new duos as it works its new freshmen into the lineup and attempts to match its doubles prowess from last season, when it took the doubles point in 19 of 25 matches.
Harvard’s top duo of co-captain Casey MacMaster and junior Denis Nguyen, who are ranked No. 20 in the country, continued their run of dominance from last season, scoring a dramatic 8-7 (9-7) win in the Draw A final over the Red Storm’s Erick Reyes and RJ Del Nunzio.
Steinroeder and freshman Brian Yeung had less success in Draw A, falling 8-7 in the first round. In Draw B, sophomores Nick Mahlangu and Kelvin Lam scored two 8-6 victories, but lost in the semifinals, 8-4.
Freshman Sebastian Beltrame and sophomore Nicky Hu lost in the first round, 8-3, but made it to the semifinals of the consolation bracket.
In singles, Nguyen, who plays at first singles for the Crimson, took an easy first-round victory and beat Penn’s Nikola Kocovic 6-4, 4-6, 6-2, in the quarterfinals of Draw A, but fell to Columbia’s Winston Lin, who is ranked No. 54 nationally, 6-5, 6-3. Chaudhuri beat Binghampton’s Robin Lesage, 5-6, 6-1, 6-0, in the first round, and followed that up with a 6-5, 6-2 win over the Monarchs’ Carlos Lopez Villa. Chaudhuri advanced to the final after his semifinal opponent, the Lions’ Dragos Ignat, retired. The Lion’s Lin won the Draw A singles event in three sets, 6-1, 4-6, 6-1.   
In Draw B, Steinroeder won his first two matches, but fell to the Bulldogs’ Tyler Lu, 6-2, 6-1, in the semifinals. But the freshman Yeung, playing in his second tournament, reached the final, beating Old Dominion’s Jonas Kuwert, the Bearcats’ Thomas Caputo, and Columbia’s Ashok Narayana on the way. Yeung lost 6-5, 6-3, in the finals to Lu.
Freshman Andrew Ball fell 6-5, 6-3 in his first-round match, but his classmate Beltrame emerged on top of Draw C, earning four straight-set victories, including a 6-3, 6-2 win in the finals over Cornell’s Colin Sinclair.  
“We have such a strong freshman class, and they’re improving every weekend,” Chaudhuri said. “They’re really competing hard, and it’s encouraging to see them do so well so early. Sebastian played amazing this weekend.”
In Draw D, Harvard had yet another player win his flight. This time, it was sophomore Kelvin Lam, who took three straight-set victories to make it to the final, where he defeated the Lions’ Max Schnur, 4-6, 6-5, 6-4.
Despite the encouraging play this weekend against Ancient Eight rivals, the Crimson is not reading too much into its performance.
“We have a lot of work to do if we want to win the league come spring time,” Steinroeder said. “It’s good to measure yourself against the Ivy teams, but not to look too much into the results because it’s hard to tell where they’re at right now.”
After two straight tournaments, Harvard will take two weekends off before heading down to the important Aggie Fall Tournament in College Station, Texas, which is one of the biggest tournaments of the fall season.
“This weekend was a great stepping stone for us,” Chaudhuri said. “Getting the first taste of what the Ivy season will be like gives us a destination and goal in mind. We saw the teams compete, and now it’s time to go back to the drawing board.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With fifteen minutes to go and the Harvard men’s soccer team (1-4-1) tied 1-1 with UMass (0-7-1), seniors Ross Friedman and Kevin Harrington took the game into their own hands. Friedman’s cross in the 76th minute found junior Hiroki Kobayashi in front of the goal, but a slow roller that made it past the goalkeeper was punched out by a UMass defender inches from the goal line.
The composed pair of seniors, whose inside-out dynamic allowed the Crimson to dominate the middle third of the field, quickly struck again. After an errant header by a Minuteman defender went out of bounds four minutes later, a Friedman cross found Harrington’s head on the far post; the ensuing header found the net. The deciding goal gave Harvard its first win of the year, 2-1, under new coach Pieter Lehrer.
“[Ross and Kevin] have been huge for us,” Lehrer said. “We play them in the middle of the field and out wide and they have been effective for us each game. Both of them are leaders for us on the field and off the field and in the locker room.”
Early on, the game closely mimicked Harvard’s 2-1 loss to Davidson, two weeks ago to the day. A 48th minute goal by junior forward Phillip Fleischman put the Crimson into the lead for the first time since the Davidson game, where an early goal by freshman Ashi Geberkidane was followed by two quick Wildcat goals that provided the deciding margin.
But empowered with a 1-0 lead, the Crimson pushed ahead early in the second half to try and put UMass away. Two minutes after his header found the back of the net, Fleischman was found again by Friedman on the right side but his header fell wide of the post. Ten minutes later, Harrington’s cross hit the junior forward in front of net but a diving UMass goalie knocked the ball away before Fleischman could get a second touch.
Three minutes later, however, the Crimson’s attacking mentality quickly backfired. After an errant touch in front of the net leaked out to a UMass defender, the Minutemen had numbers pushing the ball up the field and quickly capitalized. A deft series of passes left Josh Schwartz alone in front of the goal, where he beat sophomore goalkeeper Evan Mendez to tie the game up at one.
Overall, Harvard had the advantage over the Minutemen in every offensive statistic. In addition to the lead in both shots, 13-8, and shots on goal, 7-3, the Crimson took nine more corner kicks than its opponents.
On the heels of another two-goal performance Friday, Harrington said that the team has been more and more successful as it has pushed forward in the field.
“We have been able to do more work with the ball and get it into the offensive third more often,” Harrington said. “When we do that, we look to get the ball into dangerous areas in the box and play it out wide. The biggest thing was that guys were willing to put it all forward and once they got into the box, were willing to get their heads on the ball and that ended up with two goals [today].”
Friedman, with three assists over the weekend, was a central component of the Harvard attack. Harrington said that the senior midfielder’s ability to dominate play from the center of the field has been key in the development of the team’s offense.
“Ross is the best foot on the team,” Harrington said. “We have to get it to his foot when we can and give it to him in space and let him get it to us in the middle, where it is easy for us to get the ball. He is a phenomenal guy on the wing to be putting balls in and we try to find him every time we can and that ends up with some goals for us.”
Fleischman added that the team has focused on progressing each day and practice and that meticulous focus has shown itself in the team’s improved offensive play.
“We have a plan from the midfielder to the forward positions that is coming together right now and you can see the results,” Fleischman said. “[We are focused] on the straightforward process of trying to get better each day … focusing on little things and improving on those and then getting to the next little thing after that.”

The College’s new interim dean is now two for two in sending emails from accounts in his very own name.
Last semester, undergraduates received several emails signed by then-Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds that were sent, for some reason, from Ad Board Secretary John “Jay” L. Ellison’s account.
 
But on Monday, College students found in their inboxes a note signed and delivered by Dean Donald H. Pfister with some information on the new administrator’s office hours and reading habits.
 
In the email, Pfister highlighted his outdoor interview with Fifteen Minutes magazine, welcomed Harvard’s newest varsity sport (women’s rugby), and—Flyby’s personal favorite—gave us an update on what he’s been reading for fun. Apparently, pleasure reading for a systematic botanist is “The Flower of Empire: An Amazonian Water Lily, the Quest to Make it Bloom, and the World it Created" by Tatiana Holway.
 
“Yes, it is plant biology but it is also interesting reading for those thinking about global exploration and social history,” Pfister wrote, adorably. “Next up perhaps a good mystery.”
 We will be eagerly awaiting any future book recommendations.

Having been here for almost a month now, the novelty of getting to eat hamburgers and spaghetti all the time has officially faded. Even ice cream just isn’t so special anymore. (Disclaimer: It’s probably due to the fact that I’ve had ice cream basically every day here; freshman fifteen here I come!)
Drawing inspiration from BuzzFeed, I decided to whip up my very own food mashup. Here are some tips to keep in mind as you make your own weird concoction: make some effort to figure out what foods wouldn’t taste terrible together (kind of like when you’re deciding what flavors to pick for a Vermonster at Ben & Jerry's) and gather the courage to weather weird looks from fellow diners.
The day I went to Annenberg looking for inspiration, the dining staff had beaten me to the punch: one of the main platters was breaded chicken breast stuffed with a broccoli mix. This made my food mashup for the day pretty simple. I took some bread, spread mayonnaise on it, and stuffed the chicken inside—voilà, strange mashup sandwich!
Looking to match the creativity of the HUDS staff, I focused on making a dessert. After some initial missteps (I combined Fruit Loops and strawberry jam in a bowl because I saw some potential there. Shockingly enough, it wasn’t a good idea) I decided on a fusion of two of my favorite snacks: peanut butter and apple slices and plain vanilla ice cream. Here’s how to do it:
Waltz over to the bread toppings bar and slather peanut butter into the bottom portion of a cone.
Grab an apple and cut it into slices horizontally, using a knife to hollow out one of the ends. Scoop the vanilla in between the hollow apple slice and a flat one—you end up with a kind of apple ice cream sandwich! Put this on the cone.
Cover it all with sprinkles for extra style points (if you have chocolate syrup around, might as well throw that on too).
The concoction was pretty strange looking but tasted delightful. The thick peanut butter was pretty hard to get through, but the loud crunch of the apple combined with the melting ice cream made for an unforgettable experience.
There are thousands of schools to choose from, and while you are trying to figure out where you want to spend the next part of your life it can be hard to distinguish what makes each school different. While each institution has unique features that make it amazing, here are questions you can ask in an interview, tour, or info session that can help you figure out what a school is like. Some of these questions are geared more towards admissions officers, and others toward students, so make sure to ask appropriately!
Admissions and Financial Aid
- Is there any advantage to applying early action and/or decision?
- How do you compare students whose transcripts and GPAs are on different scales?
- Do you consider if a student needs financial aid when making admissions decisions?
- What is the financial aid process like? Is aid more loan-based or grant-based?
- Does the college anticipate a rise in tuition in the next few years and if so, by how much?
- What kinds of work study jobs are available on campus, and are there enough to meet the demands of students who need to do work study?
Academics
- Do any majors or concentrations at the school have a quota?
- How does class registration work? Are many courses lotteried?
- What is the average number of students per class?
- Are there any mandatory courses for freshman? Are there any other requisite courses or requirements for students to graduate?
- Are most classes taught by professors or by graduate students?
- How accessible are professors? Do they hold office hours for students?
- Are there tutoring and extra help resources available on campus? How accessible are they?
- Do many students study abroad? How easy is it to get study abroad opportunities and when do most students go abroad?
Student Life
- Would you say the school is more collaborative or competitive? Do students often work on projects and homework together?
- How diverse is the campus?
- Do students exhibit school pride by attending sports and school-sponsored events?
- Is greek life an important part of social life on campus? If not, what are other avenues for social life?
- How often do students visit home? Are people on campus during the weekends?
- What kind of student organizations are present on campus? Are extracurricular activities a significant part of student life?
- What is the availability of mental health services on campus? Are there services on campus that students can utilize if they need to talk to someone or seek treatment?
- Do most people live on campus? Is housing guaranteed for all four years?
- How does the school deal with overcrowding when more students matriculate than expected? Is there overflow housing available? Is housing still guaranteed?
Careers and Advising
- How hard is it to find research opportunities? Are there research opportunities for biology majors? Social studies majors?
- How does advising work on campus? What is the average number of students each adviser has?
- Does the school provide career services to help students gain employment after graduation? What percentage of students get hired after graduation?
- How successful are applicants in getting into law school? Medical school? Business School? Graduate programs?
This list can't fully recreate what going to a particular school is like, but having these questions in mind while applying will bring you one step closer to finding the perfect fit.
