After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There were tears in the eyes of many audience members by the end of the screening of “Fred Ho’s Last Year” at this year’s Boston Asian American Film Festival. Many of the people watching had known Fred Ho ’79 or had their lives touched by him in some way. He was a jazz musician (though he thought that the term “jazz” degraded the genre) who played baritone saxophone, an author, a clothing designer, and a major face in Asian American radical activism. Through all these avenues, he was a leader and mentor who left many mourning when he died of the colorectal cancer that he had been fighting for years.
The film’s director, Steven De Castro, who is a lawyer by day, was one of the many people that Ho had met and brought opportunities to. They first met in 1990 at a New York City rally against the Gulf War. Ho helped De Castro publish a chapter in an anthology of essays about the Asian American experience that is still taught in classes today. Their paths did not collide again until 2012, when De Castro saw Ho’s book “Diary of a Radical Cancer Warrior.” De Castro thought Ho had already passed away given the severity of the illness described in the book, but after doing some research online, De Castro was sitting in Ho’s apartment weeks later recording the first interview.
This is De Castro’s first movie. He was never formally taught filmmaking, but he sees writing, being a lawyer, and making movies as different ways to tell a story. For a first try by someone with no education in the subject, “Fred Ho’s Last Year” was well-received by audience members. “I’m a great editor,” De Castro told the audience bluntly. However, for many of the film’s technical aspects, he hired experienced professionals. The result is a cinematographically beautiful movie.
Fred Ho, a Harvard alumnus, was one of the most eccentric and interesting people in the jazz world, and “Fred Ho’s Last Year” showcased this. “He’s the kind of person [who], when you meet him, you think, ‘I really haven’t met anyone like him before,’” De Castro said. Though the film was centered around his illness, explaining all the surgeries, treatments, and diet changes he tried, it also examined all the other parts of his life. Ho was a Marxist as well a racial activist supporting Asian-African alliance, and he chose to view his disease as connected to his work in activism. “Cancer is a manifestation of capitalism in the individual,” he said. Though Ho’s cancer gave him lung problems, he continued to play his saxophone as long as he could. De Castro included long segments of many of Ho’s last performances, in which he demonstrated his characteristic blend of Chinese opera and traditional African American music. “I wanted to let the music speak for itself,” De Castro explained. Many of the young musicians Ho had worked with were very inspired by his work. “He teaches me how to just do something, like not even thinking about it,” explained a vocalist who sang in a piece Ho conducted.
Many of the people in the audience were people with whom Ho had worked, whether in music or in activism. “Fred had a way of keeping a catalog in his head of all the activists,” De Castro said. The screening felt almost like a commemoration service for Ho. After the movie, Royal Hartigan, a drummer who knew Ho from the age of 15 and continued to collaborate with him throughout their lives, performed a mourning ritual from the Asante people of Ghana. He played the drums and chanted words of remembrance in a moving tribute. In the question-and-answer section afterwards, one audience member with a tearful voice told De Castro, “I want to commend you for making this film…. It’s a beautiful tribute.” She explained that she hadn’t known Ho well but was part of an organization, the Asian American Resource Center, that he had helped found. Many others shared this sentiment and expressed that Fred Ho had touched their lives.
Ho survived to see the completion of the film, which he apparently liked quite a lot. “He gave me the best compliment I ever saw him give anyone: he didn’t say anything,” De Castro said. Given Ho’s tendency to critique, De Castro took this as high praise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Good war movies are hard to come by these days. So many films have already explored fascinating plots and themes within the genre, not leaving much room for originality and flare. So what’s left for the genre today? In “Fury,” David Ayer has clearly contemplated this dilemma, finding the perfect individual ingredients for success. Brad Pitt returns in a similar role to his Nazi-slaying badass from “Inglorious Basterds” to lead a tank full of more names we know and love, including Jon Bernthal from “The Walking Dead,” Logan Lerman, and Shia LaBeouf. And yet, the mixture leaves a bad taste in one’s mouth.
So why did this happen? For one, “Fury” tackles complex themes without the script to effectively analyze them. From what we can pick up from the scattered and forced moments of meaning, Ayer seems to observe the questionable justifications for losing one’s humanity in war. Ultimately, he concludes that comrades accept their violent roles because they all bear the same moral burden of war and can only survive by relying and trusting each other. It’s a good point and a fascinating topic. But in this day and age, now that original war plots and twists have arguably dried up, movies have to have a developed script to back those ideas up and to be able to say unoriginal things in a fresh, new way. “Fury” does not have that. Instead, it relies on scattered, trailer-friendly one-liners that lack any development but draw in the crowds. Of course, hearing Pitt declare, “Ideals are peaceful. History is violent,” hits a sweet spot, but it can’t support the movie all on its own.
With such an all-star cast, these isolated quotes disrespect the dramatic potential that the movie could have possessed had the actors had the opportunity to work with a better script. Especially for Logan Lerman, who showed so much promise in “The Perks of Being a Wallflower,” this looked to be a big step in his career; it was, but in the wrong direction. His character, Norman, starts off an innocent, clumsy youngster terrified of his new responsibilities as a soldier. However, after a series of tragedies, Norman suddenly transforms into an always angry, always angsty teen—perhaps a forced manifestation of “fury.” Now that he’s earned their respect simply by killing a Nazi or two, the tank appropriately nicknames him “The Machine,” and from then on, that’s essentially all Norman is: a human jukebox that’s stuck on the classic broken record of “FUCK YOU” with the bonus track, “UGH.” And just like that, what could have been promising, scripted character development melted into the two-step trajectory of sad Norman to angry Norman.
Ayer’s inattentive direction and script come at their highest cost in his ambitious portrayal of the American relationship with German natives. After a successful battle, Norman and Wardaddy (Pitt) bust through the door of two German women’s home. Instead of shooting them, Pitt comforts them in perfect German and offers them eggs as a gift. Norman quickly bonds with one of the women over music, prompting Pitt to tell him, “If you don’t take her to the bedroom, I will.” So, after a short, obvious scene of the two connecting over the similarities in their palms, they do their business and come back out to a traditional Sunday morning breakfast table, with Pitt reading the paper with coffee while the other woman cooks up some eggs. Ayer eventually juxtaposes their supposed respect for these women with the barbaric disrespect that Bernthal’s character shows them (which, just like the eggs on the table, is overdone), but the scene still paints these women in two shades: their nationality and their gender. The only thing that gives Norman’s companion any individuality is that Ayer is kind enough to at least give her a name, Emma. Thanks to the underdevelopment of the script, the scene that clearly was supposed to capture the conflict of humanity in wartime instead created a remarkably misogynistic, objectifying tone for the movie.
A few aspects of “Fury” do work out. With the exception of the last, drawn out fight scene, the battle cinematography is refreshing and creative through its short, unpredictable shots. The plot itself has a clear trajectory and captures the necessity for comrades to trust each other and work together, especially when confronted with the unclear morality of war. But Ayer’s stunted script jeopardizes the success of so many other factors, including the numerous opportunities for character development and the possibility for a new interpretation of old themes. As far as profit goes, the one-liners and cast might draw in viewers, but Logan Lerman’s screaming isn’t enough to hold the viewer’s attention, let alone create an original product.

Cue kissing in the rain. Cue a misunderstood boy with a troubled past. Cue star-crossed lovers. Cue rekindling long-lost love. And cue just about any other cliché that you have seen in every other formulaic Nicholas Sparks book-turned-film.
"The Best of Me" is the latest adaptation of a Sparks book, following eight predecessors. "The Best of Me" centers on Dawson Cole (James Marsden) and Amanda Collier (Michelle Monaghan), who are high school sweethearts brought back together after 20 years. Dawson works on oil rigs while Amanda is a stay-at-home mom with an alcoholic husband. Their paths cross once again when they are both summoned to the will-reading of a man named Tuck (Gerald McRaney), who raised Dawson after he ran away from his abusive father (Sean Bridgers). Through Tuck's last effort to reunite these two long-lost lovers, the two are instructed to spread Tuck's ashes over his backwater estate in Vandemere, Louisiana.
In a series of flashbacks, the film shows the two titular characters in high school where they fall in love, with Dawson played by Luke Bracey and Amanda played by Liana Liberato. In fact, both of the younger leads are terribly miscast, with neither looking very much like their older counterparts. In particular, it is downright distracting how little Bracey resembles Marsden. Even more so, Bracey would struggle to pass for 21, let alone 18.
Their forbidden love burns strong despite the fact that they are worlds apart. Spunky Amanda is planning on going to Tulane and comes from a wealthy southern family. Dawson's drug-peddling and abusive father makes college an impossible dream for him. However, their love blossoms, and quintessentially involves a scene of the two kissing in the rain that seemingly every Nicholas Sparks tearjerker requires. The two look to be destined for each other despite a litany of ridiculous tragedies. In the end, a devastating accident tears the two apart until fate reunites them 20 years later to bid farewell to Tuck. The sparks of desire and love still burn strong between these two, and they face the question of whether they can move on from their past scars.
Directed by Michael Hoffman ("One Fine Day"), "The Best of Me" is exactly what you would expect. It is the kind of movie where the hunky hero bares his soul and pledges his undying love and the beautiful damsel responds with a tear in her eye: "You want me to fall back in love with you? How can I do that if I never stopped?" It is this, no more, no less. Unsurprisingly, Tuck's estate has a garden which allows for plenty of opportunities for the predominantly female audience to see the chiseled abs of Marsden and Bracey.
The blatantly formulaic third act borders on being comical with how terribly predictable it is at every turn. Whether it be terminal illness, imprisonment, murder, playful swimming in the bayou, or spontaneous slow dancing, "The Best of Me" provides nearly everything the weepy romantic genre offers that Nicholas Sparks has become so very well known for.
With a predominantly '90s soundtrack that attempts to be nostalgic but instead settles for forgettable, nothing feels original about this film, which includes the script by Will Fetters and J. Mills Goodloe. The screenwriters allow themselves to fall prey to the source material of Nicholas Sparks, adding nothing more. They simply spew out the dialogue from the book without taking any risks or liberties. Similarly, while the four main actors do attempt to bring forth earnest performances for the couple of Dawson and Amanda, they are not enough to save the movie from the source material that they have to work with.
With an ending that could be seen coming from a mile away, the movie feels like episodes of "Grey's Anatomy," "CSI," and "The Secret Life of the American Teenager" packed into one melodramatic movie that falls terribly short. The film adds nothing to the romantic genre, while simply being a part of the catalogue of melodramatic and emotionally manipulative movies that are far too common nowadays.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
People call Michael Cuesta’s film “Kill the Messenger” a political thriller, with some justification. It has its fair share of brassy thriller-type scenes: arrests, intrigue, threats, chases, and untimely revelations. In its truer moments, though, it’s a work about slowing down. The movie tells the true story of how American journalist Gary Webb (Jeremy Renner) wrote an article in the 1990s exposing corruption in the US government, tasted fame, then paid for it. In ancient times, messengers bearing bad news could be slain on the spot, but Cuesta’s film reminds us that we are in the modern age. Webb slowly died a living death. It appears that the movie’s real ambition is to show the pain of this human erosion—and it might have succeeded in this goal had the focus remained on this one worthy approach. But the film, like its protagonist, ventures too far out.
There is no doubt that this work tries to say a lot. The beginning shots rapidly alternate between news headlines, documentary footage from speeches by ’80s presidents on the drug wars, and footage of the Nicaragua Contra fighters on the ground; meanwhile, suspenseful music pounds, and headings are, fittingly, “typed” out on the screen. Look at me, these boisterous images seem to holler: I am going to tell you all these very important and scary things! About American history! About journalism! About the CIA! Part of the movie is an exposé of the US government and its collusion, via the CIA in the Reagan years, with drug dealers and the human-rights-violating Contra fighters. These details were adapted from the book] “Dark Alliance,” which Webb eventually wrote to defend his article after it came under attack.
These supposedly more thrilling aspects of the story in fact do not command one’s attention very well. The film certainly isn’t great as a thriller, and that’s partly because the structure sprawls. Its documentary-history-type threads are more disorienting than helpful. Their new developments flash into the movie so fast that it is hard to keep up, and they make it more difficult to take in the other, very differently toned biopic side of the movie.
At the intersection of those tangled strings lies more interesting matter: Webb’s declining life, brilliantly acted out by Renner. The film shows how Webb roasted as a lamb on the altar of the media and CIA, the victim of smear campaigns to discredit his work and his person; he lost his family, job, and mental health. To that end, Renner’s Webb sports a pair of aviator sunglasses at the start of the film but wears them less and less as time passes. At some point he cannot protect himself from scrutiny anymore. His exposed eyes, like himself no longer hiding behind the screen of small newspaper journalism, grow haggard as he takes his invisible beating. But they seem to gather strength too. It becomes less easy to avoid their stare and its quiet accusation.
Renner, whose eyes are passionate but almost boyish, is visibly not the person of the real Gary Webb—as an actor he is more likeable, more the energetic modern type. His version of Webb’s against-the-establishment affect therefore feels a touch exaggerated. On the other hand, it works well with the idea of the movie, which is, basically, to convey a sense of Webb’s increasing agitation and desire to thrash around even while he is increasingly paralyzed. Notes after the movie’s end state that Gary Webb died in 2004, apparently from suicide.
The film’s central image anticipates its tragedy: at a holiday dinner in Webb’s home, the camera pans up the long meal table towards its head. Its speed is ominously slow. Webb’s family looks arranged like that happy domestic tableau in Norman Rockwell’s “Freedom from Want,” but in dark lighting. Precisely the lagging quality of this moment is what makes the viewer shudder, bracing for the inevitable bursting open of this heavy cloud.
The movie feels incomplete at the end. Renner’s figure of Webb walks away from his family up a slowly ascending escalator, a vision in a hazy cloud of romance and tragedy, suggesting Christian imagery of the resurrection. Alongside its namesake book by Nick Schou, this film is in a way Webb’s resurrection. The doomed messenger of ages past, a generic figure caught in the political machine, becomes Cuesta and Renner’s glorious Gary Webb: individual, great man, a sort of American Prometheus posthumously unbound. The question is whether to approve of Cuesta’s hagiographic treatment. Probably not in this secular age.
Still, the film’s brave passion is admirable, as is its intent—if it isn’t formally as unassailable as it could have been. It does seem to stare its own viewers in the eye, though, and boldly dare us to not dismiss it so easily. Like the real Webb himself, who shows up in a haunting image playing with his three kids at the end and whose presence seems unspokenly to inhabit the film everywhere with Renner’s Webb. We must not kill the messenger, after all. Nor the medium.

Of all the bizarre music choices in Jorge Gutierrez’s animated Day of the Dead-themed feature “The Book of Life,” Radiohead’s “Creep” was probably the most surprising. Our hero, Manolo Sanchez (Diego Luna), faces a tough dilemma. Manolo wants to be a musician, but he comes from a long line of bullfighters, and naturally he’s expected to carry on the family tradition. To further complicate things, Manolo has fallen for the beautiful Maria (Zoe Saldana), who disapproves of killing bulls. In the ring, when Manolo looks into the bull’s eyes and at the sword in his hand, he decides to disregard his father’s wishes and spare its life. Immediately Manolo becomes an outcast from not only his family but the entire town. So naturally, musician that he is, Manolo lets out his feelings in the only way he knows—he goes to the bullfighting arena and plays a heartfelt Spanish guitar rendition of a British alternative rock band’s debut hit from the 1990s.
“The Book of Life” bravely attempts to blend Mexican folk culture with pop culture references that American audiences will recognize, but instead of striking harmony, the juxtaposition often feels awkward. In addition to Radiohead, the film features throwback tracks from Rod Stewart, Biz Markie, and the King himself, Elvis Presley. The unlikely musical interludes often provide a laugh but ultimately distract from the mood of the film and the story being told.
The story is conveyed from the angle of a white museum curator telling a tale to three white school children. Periodically throughout the film, the curator and children are revisited for helpful, occasionally somewhat offensive commentary such as, “What’s with Mexicans and the dead?” At the end of the film, when the dust has settled and the lesson has been learned, the museum curator reiterates the moral to the children and sends them off to their suburban homes. It seems very clear that the intended audience of this film is white suburban children and their white suburban parents.
There are moments in the film when Gutierrez does find his stride with the subject matter, and the result is beautiful. In a series of scenes where the protagonist travels to the Land of the Remembered, we get a beautiful portrait of the folk Mexican view of the afterlife. These scenes also show off Gutierrez’s talent as an animator and director, and fully harness the power of 3D technology. Here, the spirit of the Day of the Dead is captured—vibrant colors dance across the screen, and themes of family, community, and tradition predominate.
The characters in the film are also multi-dimensional. Piggybacking off the trend made popular by Disney films “Brave” and “Frozen,” the film’s leading female is an empowered young woman. The daughter of a decorated general, Maria was educated abroad in literature, the arts, fencing, and kung fu. While the male characters often get into silly quarrels, Maria stands back and acts with both poise and reason.
Manolo, too, provides a good role model for children. Despite being raised in a culture where the violent sport of bullfighting is all that matters, Manolo wishes to play the guitar and make music. While he initially obeys his father’s wishes, Manolo eventually does find himself. He often makes mistakes, but he learns from his mistakes and keeps working toward his goals.
Nonetheless, “The Book of Life” also has flaws. Certain stylistic choices by the filmmakers often detract from the story and leave the viewer confused, and the story itself can be simplistic and reductive. But the film is also very entertaining. Its jokes are funny and the animation is top notch. And ultimately, the film leaves young viewers with a message that never goes out of style: just be yourself.

On October 15, 28 of our former Harvard Law School professors penned an open letter in the Boston Globe detailing their concerns about the University’s interim sexual harassment policy. As alumnae of the Law School, we are disheartened by their public dismissal of the University’s long-overdue attempt to address sexual violence at Harvard. Our professors claim that the policy inappropriately expands forbidden conduct, tramples on the rights of the accused, and did not rely on sufficient input from faculty. We applaud The Crimson’s recent editorial rebutting these claims, and write to offer a few of our thoughts as former law students.
While criticizing the policy as a product of deference to “the demands of certain federal administrative officials rather than [to] independent judgment,” the professors simultaneously state that the University “inappropriately” adopted “a definition of sexual harassment that goes significantly beyond Title IX and Title VII law." In fact, read on its face, the policy reflects an internal determination that the minimum, federally mandated requirements are not sufficient to create the environment that fosters full intellectual engagement and exploration for all members of the Harvard community. Compliance with Title IX should be a floor, not a ceiling. A university like Harvard, which prides itself on educating tomorrow’s leaders, should be at the forefront of the national response to sexual assault. Rape is the most common violent crime on American college campuses.
Without a strong anti-violence policy, student-survivors are forced to attend courses, eat their meals, and even sleep in the same spaces as their assailants. Faced with such a prospect, far too many survivors suffer serious declines in their mental, physical, and educational health. Despite the fact that this nightmarish predicament describes the lived realities of somewhere between 19 and 25 percent of female students and the 10 percent of campus rape survivors who are men, the authors of last week’s op-ed examine Harvard’s policy in an academic light, without any connection to the realities of sexual assault on campus. Professors often do not live on campus, but nearly all undergraduate (and some graduate) students do.
The letter’s concern for the rights of accused students does not land on deaf ears. The policy is imperfect, and we share a belief that disciplinary procedures require a truly neutral adjudicating body. However, we are baffled by our professors’ one-dimensional focus on the rights of an individual accused of violating the policy and their willingness to abandon the project of developing a more equitable, trauma-informed disciplinary procedure in the name of due process.
In choosing to express their objections in the Boston Globe and signing the letter as members of the Harvard Law School faculty, the professors positioned themselves as the esteemed legal experts they are, speaking to a lay audience. We are disheartened at the way the professors blurred the line between constitutionally protected due process rights critical to criminal prosecution by the state and the right to consistent and fair processes enjoyed in disciplinary proceedings by private educational institutions. Unlike geographic communities in which we are subject to criminal laws, educational communities are communities by choice. As such, we take on positive obligations to fellow community members when we join them.
Moreover, the professors’ focus on additional protections of potential perpetrators overlooks Massachusetts law: according to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in Schaer v. Brandeis University, accused students are not constitutionally entitled to due process in campus adjudication procedures. Harvard has made the decision to put the right to live in the absence of constant threats of sexual violence and objectification above the right to have sexual encounters without affirmative consent. Our professors’ refusal to consider or acknowledge the possibility of a different approach to keeping students safe is particularly disheartening, given that many of them have taught us to question the status quo.
The authors of last week’s letter fall prey to the trap that first-year law students encounter repeatedly in criminal law: the tendency to treat sexual assault differently than any other crime. Their concern for the futures of expelled perpetrators makes little sense given the lack of such concern in any other disciplinary context: What happens to the student accused of cheating on a test, stealing a laptop, or plagiarizing a paper? Similarly, their concern that alcohol increases the complexity of a sexual assault is particularly baffling coming from legal scholars. Massachusetts courts have repeatedly held that “diminished capacity resulting from the voluntary use of intoxicating liquor is not a defense to rape.”
We cannot speak to the needs of the current student body at Harvard Law School, and we do not want to. But we ask that Law School professors and administrators look directly to the current students for more information about what they need and what their concerns are. We write as alumnae who have witnessed the law school’s failure to serve survivors, and who believe that our professors’ willingness to outrightly reject an improved-but-imperfect policy perpetuates that unacceptable legacy.
Stephanie E. Davidson HLS ’13, Kristi L. Jobson ’06, HLS ’12, and Katherine L. Kraschel HLS ’12 are alumnae of Harvard Law School.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this week, University officials announced tentative plans for the creation of a new concentration, titled “Theater, Dance, and Media,” to be offered to undergraduates. Although the concentration must still be approved by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the current plan is to begin offering the concentration’s courses next fall; undergraduates would then be allowed to declare “Theater, Dance, and Media” in December of 2015.
The creation of the new concentration is a positive move, and one that bodes well for the future: The fact that the faculty is creating a new concentration to respond to demand shows an admirable openness to the intellectual desires of students. This announcement also suggests the possibility that there will be more new concentrations in the future that may serve other interests in an even broader, more diverse spectrum of academic fields.
In the recent past, there have been certain issues—such as increased funding for the UC—where the University has refused to budge despite pressure from students. However, the proposed creation of this new concentration represents the exact opposite end of the spectrum; according to President Faust, the creation of the proposed concentration is motivated primarily by student demand. It is an encouraging sign of the University’s willingness to expand its academic offerings into new areas of exploration for the sake of its students’ academic interests.
But this does not mean that every aspect of the proposal is perfect. While the need and desire for an area of study focused on the arts has been clearly demonstrated, it is less evident that “Theater, Dance, and Media” must constitute its own concentration and not a subfield of English, or perhaps some intersection of English and VES. There are a number of existing concentrations that contain distinct subfields; for example, a Classics concentrator can choose to study Classical Languages and Literatures or Classical Civilizations. Moreover, there is already common ground between the English Department and the proposed new concentration: The formal proposal itself was put forth by Martin Puchner, an English professor, and the proposed classes for the concentration will be taught by faculty drawn from current departments.
Despite these questions, the principle behind the proposed creation of the “Theater, Dance, and Media” concentration is a good one. Hopefully, making the field a distinct concentration will aid its growth and help generate interest as well as resources. Even if the exact details of the concentration are unclear, it is nevertheless encouraging to see the faculty not simply encourage students’ varied scholarly pursuits, but also actively facilitate a broadening of the University’s academic options.

UPDATED: October 23, 2014, at 11:31 p.m.
Goddamnit did I want everything: brown leather heels and quotes from “Ulysses,” endless red lipstick, and sex. Sex especially. At eighteen, I thought the feminist revolution had happened. You ever had a morning when you can’t even enter Annenberg without tripping over like three people whose genitals you’ve interacted with? That was my freshman year. But there was always something funny about those breakfast run-ins: Very few of them involved eye contact.
Not everyone has sex, not everyone wants sex, and not everyone is involved in hookup culture—that nebulous set of norms surrounding unmarried eroticism. Hookups are defined in a lot of ways, but to my Expert Lady Panel, “hookup culture” is a terrain of sexual activity characterized by sex outside of a nominally formal romantic relationship. It’s also characterized by a lot of boring think pieces: Hookup culture is bad for women because oxytocin. Hookup culture is good for women because empowerment. Woman is not a stable subject because poststructuralism.
I’m interested in hookup culture as a site of sexual politics, as a space where a lot about gender and power gets hashed out. And I’m interested in hookup culture as a grounds for constructing a different kind of sexuality: A sexuality with compassion for vulnerability. A sexuality that aims for justice. I want my sex hot, and I want it kind.
Cut back to freshman year. Crossing paths with last night’s hookup in the servery, I can see him looking at everything but my face. At the seasonal gourd display. At the breakfast pizza. Ten hours ago, I was blowing him. Now, he doesn’t know my name. What’s up with that?
First, awkwardness. We’re trained to associate sex with “awkward,” a social performance that comes from being taught that the erotic is the weirdest and most important process of identity formation there is (it isn’t). But there’s something else going on here, and it has to do with feelings. Hookup culture is often a competition to see who can feel less. Because feelings are scary, but most of all, because we’re taught that feelings necessitate other things—exclusivity, commitment, major renovations to our Gcals. Either, the cultural script goes, your partner is a walking sex toy, or you want forever/marriage/babies. We’re freaked out by the stuff in between. With that kind of binary system, there’s no space for kindness. And this falls along gendered lines: If women have feelings we’re needy; if we don’t, we’re sluts. If men have feelings they’re weak; if they don’t, they’re players. Gay men are supposed to want to fuck without commitment, and lesbians to bed down. We all know the stereotypes and we’re all so boxed in by them that it can be next to impossible to know—much less communicate—what we want.
Freshman year, I hadn’t gotten the memo about feelings. I envisioned a Third Wave utopia of friendship and coital intrigue, where I would be no one’s girlfriend, and everyone’s lover, and we’d all watch “The L Word” together and drink. Instead, I was less human than the breakfast pizza. “Haven’t you heard?” I wanted to scream. “We have had a feminist revolution!”
But apparently, we hadn’t. In sexual as in economic capitalism, the free market is rigged. And I don’t mean this in a biologically deterministic or moralistic sense, but in a social one. We’re all surrounded and formed by ideological and material systems—gender, race, class, street cred. If we’re of color, if we’re women, if we’re low-income, if we’re queer or trans or gender non-binary, a lot of times, like a weird sexist version of that Shakira song, underneath our clothes is an endless, socially-dictated story: Slut. Prude. Jezebel. Needy. Whore. Queer. Sex is already vulnerable, because it is already embedded in social systems that say that some people are less human than others. In the game of who-can-feel-less, marginalized people get hurt.
I’m not saying we have to be friends with everyone we sleep with. We don’t have to want to date them. We don’t even have to introduce them to our relatives at parties. (“Look, Grandma, who I met at the Owl!") We do, however, have to acknowledge that our sexual partners are individuals with subjectivities, and insecurities, and vulnerabilities, and feelings that need to be taken seriously, and legitimate fucking needs. Nobody is just a means to an orgasm.
Vulnerability is inherent to all social interactions. It challenges us to think ethically about the ways we engage with other human beings. I think that’s powerful. I think that critical sexual ethics can help us create kinder communities for everybody, not just those who engage in a hookup scene. Eyes bright, faces messy, rising musky from the bed: Isn’t this strange interlude of clumsy pleasure, of wanting bodies, just one more terrain of collaboration, just one of the many luminous, silly workshops in which we make a better world?

This week I am so many emotions that a book about a lost bunny rabbit I read while babysitting made me cry. In order to drink and forget midterm season/impending autumn and its attendant anxieties—Is it now too cold to go braless? Does my neck look weird in this? Do you want to snuggle with me tonight?—I and my posse are off again to Cambridge Wine and Spirits for more jugs of cheap, industrial-sized wine. May this harvest season bring you autumnal Sam Adams dioramas and rivers clogged with rowers, and may all your commodity fetishes be pumpkin spice.  
Carlo Rossi Chianti$6.99/1.5 liters; that’s $3.50 a bottle! Cambridge Wine and Spirits.
Cambridge Wine and Spirits Guy is a lovely soul, and I twitch my eyelashes at him frenetically because I have been socialized to think that suggesting sexual interest will get me access to shit: free drinks, victim blaming, extra milkshakes at B. Good. Today I am feeling like a fly piece of Cantabrigian femininity; on the way here drivers in the Square kept craning their heads to look at me being alluringly eco-friendly on my bicycle, such that I was somewhat worried they would crash their trucks. Cambridge Wine and Spirits Guy suggests Carlo Rossi—a name shared by both the preferred wine brand and childhood bestie of my grandfather—and I can only imagine my grandmother’s fear at what I have become. The wine itself, I discover later, has notes of artificial maple syrup, with brief wisps of pomegranate. It tastes like good balsamic vinegar, or rather, like good balsamic vinegar’s freshman year sexual performance: still an awkward mouthfeel, but with promising hints of what aging might bring.
Liberty Creek White Zinfandel$7.99/1.5 liters; that’s $4 a bottle! Cambridge Wine and Spirits.In lieu of a review of Liberty Creek—a wine that is as delicious as it is a tool of American hegemony—I’ve made some improvements (they're bold) to the initial label.
At Liberty Creek we craft our wines upholding the ideals of a bygone time. A time when traditions were esteemed and principles were hard-won and women and people of color couldn’t vote, and homosexuals were tried in secret courts and kicked out of Harvard.
Our long tradition of winemaking is rooted in the rich soils of California, which were taken from Mexico in 1848, because our nation is an imperialist power and Manifest Destiny a white supremacist myth. And every bottle of Liberty Creek rings faithful to the principle we hold true—that quality wines should be accessible to all former Reagan voters. Our White Zinfandel is refreshingly sweet with cranberry and watermelon fruit gushers flavors and lively notes of the flavor formerly known as fresh strawberry and cherry. Enjoy chilled. Pairs perfectly with all types of foods from the crisp salads that make women smile to spicy Asian or Latin cuisine—so ethnic!
Livingston Chablis Blanc$6.99/1.5 liters; that’s $3.50 a bottle!Cambridge Wine and Spirits.
This is delicious. It is juicy and pleasant and tastes like crisp green grapes sprinkled with sparkly pink sugar, and is almost yummy enough to make up for the fact that I haven’t gotten laid in a month. Almost. Do I TMI? Very well then, I TMI. (I am large, I contain multitudes; this is sometimes socially stigmatized.) Livingston Chablis Blanc is mild and luscious and lovely, almost as lovely as biking back with my roommate from Cambridge Wine and Spirits. We crackled over the newly fallen leaves raising moss-scent, notes of dark chocolate, hints of imminent rot. And I was thinking it’s now, it’s here, it’s this moment, and isn’t that unendurably sweet. Like low-end white wine. The kind of night that feels like butter, melts down gut-hot into your heart or your soul or your stomach and makes you deeper, rich. We cycled through the muffled-velvet streets of Cambridge, her in front and me following after, and I was guided by her blown-back hair. And I loved her so much I could hardly look at her, in that way that hurts a little, in that way that you love your friends.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Boston man reportedly assaulted a Harvard University Police Department officer last Saturday along Massachusetts Ave. and attempted to flee the scene, before ultimately being arrested by Cambridge Police, accoring to a police report.
Peter Harris, 47, was arrested on Oct. 18 for assault and battery on a police officer and disorderly conduct after he allegedly hit a HUPD officer outside Zinnia Jewelry at 1300 Mass. Ave. The suspect reportedly attempted to flee the Square in a cab.
According to the police report, Harris punched the hood of a HUPD cruiser, in which a patrolling officer was sitting. The officer then got out of the vehicle to speak to Harris, who responded “very aggressively,” according to the report. Harris allegedly refused to cooperate with the officer after being asked to sit down and show identification. Harris then reportedly swung and hit the officer on his right shoulder.
The HUPD officer attempted to place Harris under arrest, but Harris resisted and tried to flee the area by getting in a cab. The cab driver then stepped out of the car, leaving Harris in the back seat, Cambridge Police spokesperson Jeremy Warnick said.
Soon after, Cambridge Police officer Doyell Joseph arrived at the scene and helped pull Harris out of the cab. The officers then placed him under arrest and booked him at the Cambridge Police Department.
“Like we do with Harvard and with MIT and with state police, if there’s a situation in which they require or request support, [CPD] will assist right away,” Warnick said.
Harris was arraigned on Monday in Cambridge District Court. He is being held without bail and will appear before the court on Dec. 2. Warnick added that Harris will likely face a more severe sentence for assaulting an officer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twenty-five years after the former Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko visited Harvard amidst protests, eight-time NBA all-star and philanthropist Dikembe Mutombo spoke about development  projects in his native Democratic Republic of the Congo—formerly known as Zaire—on Thursday at the Law School.
Towering over the podium, the seven-foot two-inch 18-year NBA veteran discussed the hospital he founded in the DRC’s capital Kinshasa, as well as efforts to improve education and prevent Congolese brain drain.
“The world is becoming one place,” Mutombo said, calling shortcomings in education and healthcare in West Africa the “responsibility of every human being living on this planet.”
Near the end of his basketball career, Mutombo launched a foundation in his name and opened a hospital in 2007. Today, the hospital has served over 120,000 people, according to the foundation, and offers many of its services for free or reduced costs.
Mutombo discussed the rapid outflow of doctors, who leave for higher wages in South Africa, Europe, and the U.S. To combat brain drain, Mutombo has funded training for over 400 doctors and nurses at his hospital, who have gone on to pursue careers in the DRC.
The outbreak of Ebola demonstrates the need for better healthcare in West Africa, Mutombo said, citing the lack of doctors and medical facilities in the countries most affected.
Today, Mutombo said he has set his sights on building a school on the outskirts of Kinshasa as well as a “welcome house” next to the hospital to accommodate volunteers and doctors.
“My motivation has always been to improve the wellbeing of the people of Africa,” said Mutombo, who currently serves as the NBA’s global ambassador. “I believe the Africa of my ancestors will be not be the Africa of my descendents.”
Mutombo grew up in then-Zaire, before matriculating to Georgetown University with the help of a USAID scholarship, and walked on to the basketball team in his sophomore year. After graduating with a degree in linguistics and diplomacy, Mutombo was drafted fourth overall in the NBA draft and quickly earned a reputation for his defensive skills.
Law School professor William P. Alford, who serves on the board of Special Olympics International with Mutombo, invited the former NBA player to campus and moderated a question and answer session. Following his address, Motumbo stopped by the Harvard men’s basketball team’s practice.
After Mutombo finished answering questions, a swarm of students surrounded the prolific shot blocker turned philanthropist.
"It was great to see a different perspective of him—we all know him as a basketball player,” said Law School student Daniel J. Binette. “He was really inspiring...[in] giving us a charge to make a difference in the world.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lamont and Cabot libraries, two of the busiest libraries on campus, introduced on Monday self-checkout machines as an alternative to manual checkout by library staff, aimed at increasing accessibility and enhancing the experience of library users.
The two machines—one at each location—stand near the circulation desks at both libraries. While students will be able to check out most materials at the machines, they will still have to refer to the circulation and reserves desk to take out items on reserve and equipment. They will also still need to check their bags with a Securitas guard before exiting the library.
The addition of the two machines is the latest development in a broader effort that aims to streamline a student’s experience of entering and exiting the library.
Joshua Parker, head of access services for the humanities and social sciences, said that the installment of the machines serves to address student feedback about their experiences at the library. He added that discussions about using the machines began over a year ago.
“I see the self-check devices as being part of a broader cluster of efforts at the library to respond to that user feedback, and to try to think creatively about how we can address some of those issues,” he said.
Other recent changes at the Harvard library system include the implementation of the “Secure Exit” system, which allows Securitas guards at the library door to scan student books rather than manually checking to see if they belong to the library. In addition, the opening of the west entrance to Lamont Library from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. offers another avenue for students to exit and enter the library.
Parker said that the machines not only increase student convenience but also benefit the library staff, giving them more time to assist visitors at the library.
“It allows library staff to concentrate their energies on things that have more of an impact on the patron,” he said.
These machines are not new on campus, as both the Wolbach Library and Physics Research Library—two smaller, specialized research libraries—currently have machines as well.
Some students said they believed that the machines could be useful assets at the libraries.
“I think I’ll use the machine in the future, especially if there’s a long line at the regular checkout desk,” said Michael L. He ’18.
“I literally can’t see how they wouldn’t be useful. If they make it easier for students to use the school’s resources, then they are only a positive,” said Dylan M. Clark ’18.

This is the first in a series of roundup articles leading up to Election Day.
With Election Day just ten days away, polls show Republican Charles D. Baker ’79 with a narrow lead over the veteran Massachusetts Democrat and Attorney General Martha M. Coakley in a heated race for governor.
An average compiled by the political aggregator RealClearPolitics shows Baker with a lead of about 4.5 points. One poll shows the race tied, while others show Baker with leads of 4 and 6 points, respectively. Another poll released Thursday night by The Boston Globe shows Baker with a 9-point advantage.
Baker, the consensus Republican nominee since long before he won his party’s primary in September, has made a steady march up in the polls; ten months ago, he was 11 points behind Coakley, who is perhaps best known for her frustrating 2010 special election loss to Scott Brown in a U.S. Senate race that generated millions of dollars in out-of-state spending and outsized national media attention.
The Brown loss has followed Coakley, who is once again attracting attention as a weak campaigner. In Massachusetts, Democrats enjoy a significant advantage in registered voters and, almost as critically, in electoral and get-out-the-vote infrastructure.
Coakley is a longtime public servant. Before her current post as attorney general, she was the district attorney for Middlesex County for eight years.
Baker has also served in government at the cabinet level for two Republican governors in the 1990s. In the private sector he has worked as the CEO of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care.
In another close race, Seth W. Moulton ’01, a graduate of the Kennedy School, is locked in a tight race with Republican hopeful Richard R. Tisei to represent the 9th Congressional District, including Boston’s north suburbs. Moulton scored a huge win in September when he knocked out longtime Rep. John Tierney in what was widely considered a late-round upset.
In the attorney general race, Maura T. Healey ’92 also looks strong. Healey, who played basketball for the Crimson as an undergraduate, received the endorsement of the Boston Globe earlier this week and would be the first openly gay attorney general.
Harvard affiliates are in action elsewhere across the region, as well. In Rhode Island, polls show Gina M. Raimondo ’93, the state’s treasurer, with a 6-point lead over her Republican challenger.
In Connecticut, Thomas C. Foley ’75 is making his second bid for governor. Foley lost four years ago to Democrat Dannel P. Malloy, whom he is now challenging again. The race has grown increasingly hostile in recent weeks. A Quinnipiac University poll out earlier this week shows it neck and neck.
In Upstate New York, GOP first-timer Elise M. Stefanik ’06 has a safe lead over Democrat Aaron Woolf.

Seniors interested in a career in public service will now be able to meet potential employers in a structured on-campus recruiting process—similar to that used by elite private companies—at Harvard’s first Public Service Recruiting Day on Nov. 14.
The event, announced by several career advising offices on Tuesday, will offer leading public service employers the chance to come to campus and meet one-on-one with seniors who are passionate about the field.
The new initiative is the result of a collaboration between the Center for Public Interest Careers, the Institute of Politics, and the Office of Career Services. The 20 participating employers include Green Corps, Immigrant Justice Corps, and Points of Light, among others.
Gene A. Corbin, the assistant dean of student life for public service who coordinated the planning of the initiative, called it “a bold experiment.” According to Corbin, the public sector lacks resources for recruiting as compared to the private sector, and organizations in the field usually recruit at a time when seniors have already made other postgraduate plans.
“This is an innovative effort to make it possible for some leading public service organizations to come to campus in a structured and early way,” Corbin said. “We are not aware of other campuses that have a similar effort.”
Seniors interested in the program will submit an application before the event, and successful applicants will be matched with participating employers. On the recruiting day, each employer will have the chance to interview six students, as well as receive a collection of the resumés of all applicants. The day will close with a reception where students can connect with public service recruiters in an informal setting.
According to Travis A. Lovett, director of the CPIC, the nonprofit sector has traditionally struggled to attract very strong candidates from Harvard. Although over 50 percent of students on campus indicate that they are actively engaged in volunteering or public service work, only about 20 percent choose to work in fields related to public service after graduation, according to data collected by the Office of Career Services.
“Hopefully this will encourage other leading institutions to follow our lead,” Lovett said. “This is something that we are really excited to take a lead on.”
Amy A. Howell, director of the Office of Career and Internship Services at the IOP, said that although students’ interest in the public sector has been rising recently, employment opportunities in the field can be much more “daunting” to navigate than those in the private sector.
“There are folks who end up falling into finance and consulting tracks because the process isn’t clear for the public sector,” she said. “It’s our hope that [on the recruiting day], relationships will be formed, and organizations will walk away with some really strong seniors so that when they are ready, come April or May, to make an offer, that will be the first place that they look.”
The initiative is the fruit of a planning process that spanned over a year, during which staff members studied recruitment models of prominent private companies and incorporated their best practices into the design of the program, Lovett said.
Eva A. Guidarini ’15, student president of the IOP, said that she thinks the program is “incredibly significant,” and that many students have expressed excitement about the program.
“I think this is the game-changer,” she said.
The application to the program is currently open, and will close on Sunday.

Earlier this month, Dumbarton Oaks, a Harvard-owned satellite library and research institution located in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C., celebrated the opening of its new fellows’ housing building, which will serve as the home of more than 20 junior and senior fellows and their families.
The opening of the fellowship house comes after 18 months of construction and more than three years of planning.
Previously, fellows were housed about a half-mile away from the main research center of Dumbarton Oaks, which attracts scholars from across the globe through fellowship programs on Pre-Columbian arts, Byzantine studies, and garden and landscape architecture. Known for its expansive gardens and also as the proverbial birthplace of the United Nations, Dumbarton Oaks was bequeathed to the trustees of Harvard by the Bliss couple in 1940.
Dumbarton Oaks Director Jan M. Ziolkowski said that the previous housing was not only far from the central campus but also substandard, earning a far lower score on building assessments than any of the other buildings on campus.
“Our Achilles heel was the fellows’ housing,” Ziolkowski said.
The new fellowship house features gardens of its own as well as a music practice room, a basement lounge, a presentation space, and a gym. The building will also qualify for gold certification under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design program, due in part to the use of geothermal heating and recycled and environmentally friendly building materials.
Many of the center’s campus buildings, including its museums and libraries, were upgraded in 2008. When an apartment building went up for sale in 2011 half a block from the institution’s main campus, the administration saw an opportunity to address shortcomings in fellows’ housing, Ziolkowski said. The building was purchased, stripped down, redesigned, and completely remodelled.
“Here we had the chance to take a building, to go into it, to tear it to pieces, and to rebuild it to be housing that will last for decades if not centuries, that will serve our programmatic needs,” Ziolkowski said.
Ziolkowski said that he hopes that the proximity of the fellowship house to the rest of the campus will foster “fortuitous encounters” between fellows, senior fellows, short-term scholars, and other visitors.
The future of the old fellows’ building is uncertain. Fellows will not officially move into the new fellowship house for two weeks, and their former residence will “most likely” host visiting classes, interns, and graduate fellows, Ziolkowski said.
The old residence may also be used to house students who enroll in the Wintersession course about art, philanthropy, and diplomacy offered by Dumbarton Oaks, added Yota Batsaki, executive director at Dumbarton Oaks.

Students, faculty, and guests gathered at the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts for the opening of artist Simon Fujiwara’s exhibit, "Three Easy Pieces," on Thursday. The display is Fujiwara’s first solo exhibition at an arts institution in the United States.
The exhibit consisted of sculptures of smashed mugs, video clips of dialogue between a subject and an interrogator, typed letters attached to books, and photographs. Fujiwara’s work is meant to challenge its viewers to think beyond the artistic medium and engage with the “larger social implications,” said James Voorhies, director of the Carpenter Center and organizer of the exhibit.
Fujiwara’s work, featured in museums around the world, weaves his personal experiences into broader historical, social, and political issues through mediums such as sculpture and video, Voorhies added.
“Simon’s work is a departure from his biography, growing up with a British mother and a Japanese father and being gay, in that they speak to larger issues such as gender, sexuality, and racism,” he said “That is one way these works connect the arts to our understanding of the world.”
The exhibition of Fujiwara’s work is part of a larger goal by the Carpenter Center to bring together people from different scholarly backgrounds and to encourage discussion across the disciplines, according to Voorhies.
Attendees said the the Carpenter Center, designed by Le Corbusier and completed in 1963, facilitated the exchange of ideas that Fujiwara’s exhibit inspires.
“I am a big fan of the building...this building is unlike any other building on campus,” said Ian T. Hassett ’15, a VES concentrator. “Things like this exhibit draw people in here that would not otherwise be here. Bringing people into this space, being in it, being influenced by it, even subconsciously because they are ostensibly here for the art, is an important way for people to form connections with this place.”

Despite a near 60 percent increase in the number of club sports that applied for Undergraduate Council funding this semester, the Council is expected to, on average, fund organizations at higher rates than last year.
The increase comes at the same time, however, that the Athletics Department appears to have reduced the maximum amount it allocates to club sports teams from $500 or more to $460, according to UC Finance Committee Chair Leah C. Singer '16 who oversees the majority of the Council’s allocations.
Most club sports teams rely on both the UC and the Athletics Department for funding each year.
Last year, UC leaders said that, because of budget constraints, they were only able to allocate about $32,000 in total to club sports for the fall semester. This year, though, the Council has been able to increase allocations by over 50 percent to about $50,000.
The increase is due in part to lower demand among other student groups applying for general funds and to changes in the finance committee's policies that have given club sports greater priority, according to Singer.
Although the allocations will not be officially finalized until the entire UC votes on them Sunday, the current numbers will very likely be approved, according to Singer.
The highest any club sport received from the Council this semester is $1,400, up from $1,275 last year, but notably lower than the $2,000 figure many groups received the previous year. Singer still praised the increase this year, saying she is “extremely proud” that the UC was able to increase funding while the number of sports applying ballooned.
At the same time, Singer, along with club sports leaders, allege that the Athletics Department has reduced the maximum amount of funding allotable for groups.
Casey E. Blodget, the recreational programs and club sports coordinator for the Athletics Department, declined to comment on whether any such cuts, in fact, have occurred. Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich was not able to be reached for comment.
The Athletics Department’s club sports handbook indicates an increase of three club sports teams this year compared to last.
Tyler T. Jankauskas ’16, the treasurer of Shotokan karate, said in an interview Thursday that his group’s funding from the Athletics Department was cut drastically from about $1,400 last fall to $460 this semester, despite having reportedly applied for $3,000. Harvard men’s swimming received about $500 last fall from the Athletics Department, but only $200 this semester, according to Singer, who referenced their application to the UC.
Singer said that, to her knowledge, no club sport received more than $460 this semester from the Athletics Department. In the past, the groups have received about $500 or more, Singer added.
“It’s just very bizarre. It almost feels like a backdoor way to give more of the responsibility to the UC to fund what [the College] should be funding,” she added.
Jankauskas, for his part, said he was “very surprised” when he saw the large cut in funding. He added that the cuts will “limit” the group’s operations, including its ability to purchase equipment and hire instructors.
“We just have a bunch of things we’d like to do, but we don’t have any funding to do it,” he said, adding that the group was “absolutely nowhere near” the amount of funding it ideally wished for.
Crystal K. Stowell ’15, president of club speedskating, said that her club, too, saw a cut of about $40 in Athletics Department funds.
Stowell said she wasn’t expecting the cut, but that the $40 cut alone will have “minimal effect” on the group.
Matt R. Jacobson ’17, treasurer of club men’s hockey, said that his group received $60 more from the Athletics Department this year, but that the total amount received was about $460, the alleged maximum.
UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos '15 said that he is “grateful” the University does fund club sports in part, but that groups will “suffer” from the cuts.
Singer noted what she saw as an apparent contradiction the University’s focus on student travel group funding and the cuts to club sports.
“It seems contradictory to emphasize travel safety in a working group, but then cut club sports in funding. We all know they travel for tournaments. It doesnt take much to put that together,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust, fresh off an international trip to Mexico, will stop in Dallas on Friday for an alumni event and to give a speech on the importance of college at a local magnet school.
The speech is scheduled for 9:00 a.m. Friday morning at Dallas’s Booker T. Washington High School for the Visual Arts.
The speech is not focused on attracting students to Harvard but rather has a broader goal, Faust said last week.
“It’s much broader than Harvard,” she said. “It begins with ‘is [college] worth it?’ in the most narrowly construed way which is, ‘How about the dollars?’ What do you invest?’ and so I have a lot of statistics that I’m sure you’ve seen in many settings about how much better in life college graduates do financially and also in terms of employment vs unemployment, and then some other measures which can be expressed in metric terms, like health outcomes, civic participation, all those things.”
Faust added that she plans to emphasize the importance of college beyond simple dollars and cents.
“Then I move to a more abstract consideration of what the impact of college is,” she said. “Creating habits of mind that enable you to adapt in situations well beyond what you may have trained for in a particular job.”
Faust’s Dallas speech marks the conclusion of a major international trip that saw her spend most of this week in Mexico. There, she met with Harvard affiliates and alumni and hosted a major alumni reception in Mexico City. More than 500 attended the reception.
At the event Faust—who rarely takes major abroad trips more than once a year—highlighted Harvard’s global vision.
“The University’s increasingly global reach is exemplified by the students and faculty we now attract, and by expanding research and course offerings across the University,” Faust said, according to the Harvard Gazette. “The research interests that spark connections between Harvard and Mexico are extraordinarily varied—from archaeology to the arts, from education to public health, to economics, politics, [and] public policy.”
The event also featured a panel of Harvard officials, including Vice Provost for International Affairs Jorge I. Dominguez, Dean of the School of Public Health Julio Frenk, and others. Before assuming his deanship, Frenk was the Mexican health minister.
Faust, who spent Thursday in Dallas with no major public events, will finish her trip with a major alumni event Friday night that is expected to draw participants from across the state. The event marks the 100-year anniversary of the founding of the Harvard Club of Dallas.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Melissa Harris-Perry, host of the eponymous weekend MSNBC news show and a political science professor at Wake Forest University, discussed disenfranchised American voters, the role of minority groups in a democracy, and her life as a public intellectual Thursday.
Nearly 400 attendees crowded into the Radcliffe Institute’s Knafel Center to hear Harris-Perry’s talk, given as this year’s Maurine and Robert Rothschild Lecture.
At the event, Harris-Perry emphasized the importance of protecting the political interests of women and racial minorities.
“To live in a democracy is to have the right to govern, not to simply be governed…to lose without fearing that winners take all,” she said in her opening remarks.
Harris-Perry spoke of recent breakthroughs by women and African Americans in politics. She cited not only President Obama’s 2008 election as the first black president, but also advances of women like Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, and Nancy Pelosi to unprecedented positions of political visibility.
Despite this progress, Harris-Perry said, difficulties remain. She particularly discussed the ongoing debate over abortion, and “felon disenfranchisement”—the exclusion of otherwise eligible voters due to conviction of a felony—as barring many black men from influencing election outcomes.
“We make progress in fits and starts, and we go back,” she said.
Answering questions from audience members after her address, Harris-Perry discussed balancing life in the media and academia as a black woman and feminist.
“I share a socially-constructed identity with many people who are marginalized, but I’m no longer a marginalized voice,” she said. “One of the things that has been powerful and frankly difficult [for me] to navigate is a shifting sense of identity.”
She recounted an incident when she wore a pair of tampon-shaped cotton earrings during her TV show to bring attention to the abortion restrictions passed in Texas, inciting outrage among viewers.
“For me, that reaction is all about the disgust about women’s bodies, ” she said. “Tampons are ‘disgusting’ because they might go inside a woman’s vagina,” she said.
Audience members said they were impressed by Harris-Perry’s forceful personality.
“[She’s] definitely the kind of professor that we would want here at Harvard in a seminar setting,” said Yusuph O. Mkangara ’17. “I enjoyed her candid comments.”
Jamarcus Purley, a researcher at the Harvard Family Research Project, said he was pleased to find variety in the composition of audience members.
“When you talk about race and gender, you tend to see a small society participate, due to a lack of identification with the conversation,” he said.
Purley also said he appreciated Harris-Perry’s honesty in discussing difficult topics and advocating for political inclusivity.
“I thought her candidness, when she spoke about marginalized communities, shed a great deal of light on [subjects] that you typically don’t hear about in communities of privilege,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You know that inevitable scene in House where all the young doctors think their patient has Lupus? Or maybe you’d relate better with CSI, and that moment you know is coming 30 minutes in when they bring in a suspect. It’s never Lupus, and that first guy never did it.
That scene always seems so scripted, right? So fake. But it’s not. It’s probably the most realistic scene in the series. That scene is all around us, playing out every day.
Don’t believe me? Just look at where we are five games into the Ivy League season (you were wondering when we’d actually get to the football, weren’t you?).
If we were doctors, here is the evidence we’d have to make a diagnosis.
The League appears to have separated into two tiers. In the bottom half, Penn, Brown, Cornell and Columbia are a combined 3-17, with the only Ivy win among the group coming when Penn (1-4, 1-1 Ivy) beat Columbia (0-5, 0-2 Ivy). The Bears (2-3, 0-2 Ivy) will likely rise to the top of that bunch, with their two losses coming to Harvard by eight points and Princeton by 11. But the rest? Forget them.
The other four teams have presented piles of contradictory evidence that we as crime investigators would have to sort through to identify the best team. Here is each’s resume:
Yale (4-1, 1-1 Ivy) beat FBS-level Army, has scored 30 points in every game with the best rushing offense and passing offense in the game, and has an offensive line that has given up only five sacks.
As impressive as the Bulldogs have been, Dartmouth (4-1, 2-0) beat them in New Haven, 38-31, on Oct. 11 after beating Princeton at the end of last season. The Big Green also boast some of the league’s most dynamic individual players, with conference-leading returner Ryan McManus, everywhere-linebacker Will McNamara and electric quarterback Dalyn Williams.
Princeton (3-2, 2-0) has two losses, but both were on the road and out of conference. The Tigers are the only team with a top-three scoring offense and scoring defense thus far, and Harvard coach Tim Murphy said that’s for real. While Princeton has needed to rack up points  to win in years past, the Tigers are a balanced team with talent everywhere now. They’ve given up just 1.7 yards per rushing attempt.
Harvard’s (5-0, 2-0) defense has been flat-out dominant, giving up just over 10 points per game. But the Crimson has yet to play a team that currently has a winning record, so how much do we really know?
With so much conflicting evidence and so much missing evidence, we fall back on what we know, just like the doctors diagnosing lupus or the cops going after the guy who already has a rap sheet.
Harvard and Princeton shared the Ivy title last year, which was the biggest reason they were “1a” and “1b” in the preseason media poll. Five games in, there is no compelling reason to change that.
But as Dr. House knows, the easy, established answer is rarely the right one. That’s why we love sports, too. It starts out looking the same each year, but as we run more tests and gather more evidence, something unique emerges.
The truth will come out over the next five weeks, starting Saturday when Harvard travels to Princeton. But the full diagnosis might not be clear until the final week of the year. With Yale coming to Cambridge and Dartmouth playing the Tigers, the schedule sets up for as much drama as any primetime show on FOX.
Here are my predictions for the first full week of Ivy play.
CORNELL AT BROWN
Expect the Big Red’s charity tour to continue this week in Providence. And nobody needs it more than Brown. Just when it seemed like things could not get worse after losses to Harvard and Princeton, a squirrel caused a city blackout earlier this week. If the scoreboard was affected, we might not find out during this game between bottom-three offenses. Maybe the squirrel saw this matchup on the schedule and decided electrocution was a more exciting alternative.
Prediction: Brown 22, Cornell 9
HARVARD AT PRINCETON
After two dramatic wins by the Tigers, we’ll find out what type of trilogy this is on Saturday. Will we see the Return of the Jedi, with senior quarterback Conner Hempel returning from injury to seek revenge for the comeback win Princeton pulled off the last time these teams played in New Jersey? Or are the Crimson in for Alien 3, a bad couple hours during which the monsters win? Harvard’s lackluster offense over the last couple weeks does not inspire confidence, nor does the team’s lack of big game experience thus far, but I see the Crimson finding a way to finally top the Tigers.
Prediction: Harvard 38, Princeton 37
DARTMOUTH AT COLUMBIA
If anyone is capable of a hangover loss after winning at least four of its first five games for the first time since I was four years-old, it’s Darty. But against the Lions, I don’t see it happening. The Big Green will roll, and the unfortunate Daily Spectator writers will be sent back to the thesaurus for another synonym for inept. How about execrable? Oh, you used that in 2011?
Prediction: Dartmouth 35, Columbia 6
PENNSYLVANIA AT YALE
The Quakers’ eight-game losing streak was over after they topped Columbia last week. But another one is about to start. It’s too bad Penn fell apart before I could get an elaborate Pennthouse pun into Around the Ivies. Maybe I’ll have a good one revolving around Pennance by the time the Bulldogs score their 40th point Saturday. Maybe not.
Prediction: Yale 51, Penn 17

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Heading into the second half of the season, the Harvard football team finds itself in a familiar position. For the third-straight year, the Crimson (5-0, 2-0 Ivy) is undefeated leading up to the Princeton matchup.
But if history repeats itself, the Tigers (3-2, 2-0 Ivy) won’t let Harvard leave Princeton Stadium with its perfect record intact when the two teams face off on Saturday.
In 2012, the Crimson held a 24-point lead early in the fourth quarter. 13 minutes and four Tigers scores later—the last of which was a 36-yard Hail Mary pass from quarterback Quinn Epperly to wideout Roman Wilson—Harvard had its first loss of the season.
Fast forward a year, and the Crimson found itself entrenched in a triple-overtime battle with Princeton, this time at Harvard Stadium. Playing at home didn’t bring any luck to the Crimson, however. Harvard coach Tim Murphy experienced the painful version of deja vu when Epperly and Wilson connected in the third extra period to score and hand Harvard its only loss of 2013.
The good news for the Crimson is that Wilson is no longer around. The bad news? Both Epperly as well as Princeton’s other signal-caller, Connor Michelsen—who threw for three touchdowns in the fourth quarter in 2012—are still handling play-calling duties for the Tigers.
“[Michelsen and Epperly] both know the offense inside and out,” Murphy said. “They’re both athletic, improvisation guys, so you take away the jersey numbers and it’s the same stuff. [They are] two really outstanding quarterbacks, and they may have two of the best four quarterbacks in the league on the same team.”
Both quarterbacks—now seniors—have received significant playing time since their sophomore years, when Princeton took advantage of Harvard’s fourth-quarter meltdown. Their added experience since then serves only to make each more dangerous, according to Murphy.
Epperly sat out last week’s contest against Brown due to injury, but without Epperly’s status for Saturday, the Harvard defense has been preparing for both field generals, especially given the multi-quarterback schemes that Princeton likes to run.
“They throw out a lot of crazy formations that you don’t typically see in a football offense, but we’re ready for them,” junior linebacker Scott Peters said.
Despite returning most of its starters, Harvard’s offense has been plagued by injury and at times looked nothing like the scoring machine that put up an average of 37.1 points per game last year. The offensive unit that takes the field at Princeton Stadium should resemble the predicted preseason squad, however, with the return of senior quarterback Conner Hempel and a full backfield.
In the first offensive possession of the season, Hempel had to leave the game with a back injury after being hit hard on a scramble. Hempel finally returned to a full week of practice this past week and is expected to start Saturday.
“It was very tough,” Hempel said. “Senior year, [there are] lots of expectations for yourself, for the team, and then fourth play of the year, you go out with a back injury…. I’m just fortunate to have the opportunity to come back in and finish the season.”
Junior running back Paul Stanton returned to full playing time last week against Lafayette after missing much of the first half of the season from a preseason ankle injury. His return fleshed out a backfield that contained senior fullback Andrew Casten and freshman Semar Smith.
Stanton and company may have a tough time at Princeton, though, against the third-ranked rushing defense in the country. The Tigers lead the Ancient Eight, allowing just 61 rushing yards per game.
With past heartbreaking losses to Princeton in mind, the visitors might find it difficult to treat Saturday’s game as just another league contest, but Peters feels that the importance of the matchup in the grand scheme of the championship race outweighs any thought of the past.
“You have to treat every one of these games like an Ivy League Championship game, like our own version of the Super Bowl,” Peters said. “There’s definitely an element of revenge, but we don’t want that to be our mindset. We just want to be psyched up.”

Want to impress your peers in the d-hall but don’t actually have time to read the news? Midterms got you feeling like you live under a rock? Are you actually living under a rock? There are more noble reasons than these to read the news, of course, but no matter what, Flyby has you covered, with some of important world news going around the web this week:
New Ebola Reportings: Nine people in Connecticut, including three Yale students, are under quarantine after it became apparent that they might have been exposed to the Ebola virus. They are not sick, but are under watch after Governor Dannel P. Malloy declared a public health emergency in the state. There are confirmed imported cases of Ebola in Nigeria, Senegal, and the US. In September, a man travelling from Liberia to Texas became infected with the virus, as did the two health workers who tended to him, and there are other suspected imported cases in France, Italy, Mali, Spain, Sweden, Uganda, and the United Arab Emirates. Full 24 hour coverage of the epidemic can be found here.
Shootings in Canada: On Wednesday, a gunman shot and killed a young soldier guarding the National War Memorial in Ottawa, Canada, before entering the Parliament building and firing multiple times. He was shot and killed by law enforcement. This is the second deadly attack on a uniformed member of Canada’s armed forces in three days.
Meeting of the European Union: EU leaders met  in Brussels yesterday and today to discuss climate change and the Ebola epidemic. The main focus of the meeting is a “package of climate change targets for 2030,” but the Union has also already pledged the equivalent of nearly $750 million to handle the Ebola epidemic worldwide. British Prime Minister David Cameron plans to call on EU leaders to boost that number to 1 billion euros.
Blackwater Guards Found Guilty: On Wednesday, four former security guards for the private military contractor Blackwater were convicted for the 2007 shootings of over thirty Iraqis in Baghdad. As Fox News reports, “A federal jury found Nicholas Slatten guilty of first-degree murder, the most serious charge in a multi-count indictment. The three other guards -- Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard -- were found guilty of multiple counts of voluntary manslaughter, attempted manslaughter and gun violations.”
Campaigning in the US: It’s now two weeks before the midterm congressional elections that will decided whether or not the Senate will switch from a Democratic to Republican majority. Right now it’s looking good for Republicans, who need to pick up six seats to tip the balance. Full coverage of election season can be found here.
Democracy Protests in Hong Kong: Protesters from various trade unions, women’s groups, and left-leaning political parties have continued their marches, most recently after Hong Kong’s Chief Executive C.Y. Leung told media outlets that free elections would give poor people too much power. In recent weeks, demonstrators have paralyzed portions of Hong Kong with road blockades and massive rallies after restrictions were imposed on the 2017 elections for Chief Executive, the highest public office in the city.
Around Harvard: Cabot Library will begin renovations, likely in fall 2015. The Harvard campus has made preparations for potential Ebola cases, although the risk is currently estimated to be low. The University is also likely to accommodate students from affected countries over the winter. Two-thirds of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences faculty are slated to move to Allston in 2019, and Harvard is likely to offer a concentration in Theater, Dance, and Media for undergraduates beginning in 2015. Oh, and this senior needs help finding a title for his Social Studies thesis.
