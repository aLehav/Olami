After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
Renovations on the cupola of Cabot House’s Briggs Hall have prompted the creation of a time capsule, which current students will fill with reflections on their college experiences and letters to future generations of Cabot residents.
The opportunity to place the capsule inside the cupola came when renovations to the House, which include the restoration of the cupola in accordance with the Cambridge Historical Society’s standards, began. The cupola currently sits on the lawn in the Radcliffe Quadrangle as repairs take place.
The capsule will be opened in 2036, Harvard’s 400th anniversary, according to Cabot Co-House Master Stephanie Khurana.
Khurana said the idea for the time capsule stemmed from time spent reflecting on the history of Cabot and Radcliffe College.
“We thought it might be a good opportunity to actually share how things are in the present day for those in the future.” she said. “Because we’ve really been able to learn so much from looking back at our history and really being inspired by the values of Radcliffe around inclusivity and respect and around caring for one another—really getting back to our motto of ‘Semper Cor’ which means ‘Always Heart.’”
Khurana said she believes the time capsule has become a popular topic of conversation around the House, and she hopes current students will take advantage of the chance to share something meaningful about their lives—wishes for the future, the challenges they face, or anecdotes about the Cabot community.
She said that she feels student submissions will also provide an opportunity for alumni visiting Cabot in 2036 to reflect on their experiences as undergraduates.
House Administrator Amanda Pepper sent an email to the Cabot community last week informing students of the opportunity to craft notes to include in the capsule. Students have until May 15 to submit items.
Khurana added that the time capsule, which will include photographs in addition to student notes, was scheduled to be installed in advance of Commencement to give current Cabot seniors the opportunity to participate.
According to an email sent over the Cabot House list on Thursday, the cupola will be placed back on top of Briggs Hall once the final exam period ends.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
UPDATED: May 9, 2014, at 6:00 a.m.
University President Drew G. Faust said Wednesday that she will work with faculty members to arrange for a “thoughtful exchange” on climate change next fall but that she does not plan to hold the open meeting with the Corporation and members of the activist group Divest Harvard, for which members of the latter group have publicly agitated in recent weeks.
Faust said in a sit-down interview Wednesday that she plans to engage faculty members to determine “ways in which we can have really substantive, thoughtful exchange on these issues next year.”
 In demanding an open meeting, she said, Divest Harvard is capitalizing on “a chance to draw attention to itself rather than a discourse and an interchange on substantive issues.”
Faust’s assertion came even as roughly 120 faculty members in support of the movement issued a letter on Monday calling for an “open forum in which members of the Corporation, students, faculty, and alumni speak” about divestment.
The timing of the faculty letter was pegged to the arrest of Divest Harvard member Brett A. Roche ’15, who was one of several of the group’s members blockading entrances to Mass. Hall last Wednesday and Thursday as part of an effort to secure an open meeting with the Corporation.
“An open forum should be held, not because students demand it at a demonstration...but because an open forum should have been held long prior to any demonstration,” the faculty members wrote.
They also wrote that Roche’s arrest “echoed the arrest of students protesting civil rights violations in the 1960s, of Henry David Thoreau protesting the Mexican War and slavery.”
Harvard did not press charges against Roche.
On Tuesday, a day after receiving the second letter from faculty members, Faust expressed disagreement. She told members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at their monthly meeting that while the University is committed to the principle of free speech, Roche’s actions did not qualify as “civil discourse.”
The arrest and community reaction to it are just the latest point of tension in an ongoing back and forth regarding fossil fuel divestment.
Harvard Faculty for Divestment, as the group of faculty members calls itself, issued its first open letter in late April, urging Faust and the Corporation to divest as soon as possible, despite Faust’s previous statements that the University would not do so.
Faust responded to that letter the same day, saying that she respected the perspectives of Harvard’s faculty members, but that the University would not divest and that it should, instead, focus on how its “programs of research and education can best contribute to accelerating the transition to renewable sources of energy.”
On Tuesday, Faust told Faculty members that she is “more than willing to hear the views of everyone in our community about how Harvard can most effectively contribute to a sustainable future.” She noted that she has previously met with divestment proponents on at least seven occasions.
In their Monday letter, however, faculty members wrote that the Harvard Corporation—of which Faust is ex officio chair—has “to date stood behind closed doors and issued statements, often in a dismissive tone” with regard to divestment.
Harvard’s debate over divestment has attracted increased attention this week in the wake of Stanford University’s announcement that it will divest from coal companies.

CORRECTION: May 9, 2014
An earlier version of this article and its headline incorrectly stated the subject of the conversation with faculty proposed by University President Drew G. Faust. In fact, Faust said she will work with Faculty members to develop a "thoughtful exchange" on climate change, not divestment, next fall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Seventy-one Harvard undergraduates were awarded the Hoopes Prize for outstanding scholarly work or research, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences announced Thursday.
The prize, which is funded by the estate of Thomas T. Hoopes ’19, is typically awarded to seniors for excellent theses. The award includes $4000 for the student and $1000 for the faculty member who nominated them. Faculty committees select the winners from the pool of nominees every spring.
Georgia H. A. Shelton ’14, who won a Hoopes prize for her thesis entitled “The Biodiversity of the Bees at the Arnold Arboretum," said the prize was the culmination of several years she spent researching and working at Harvard’s Arnold Arboretum.
“It was really amazing to know that I could spend three years working on a project like this and have a product I could be proud of,” Shelton said. “I certainly never expected to get it.”
Many other seniors echoed that sentiment.
“Academically [writing a thesis] is like you’re taking a whole extra course load...at the end of the day it’s totally worth it,” said Krishnan S. Ramanujan ’14, who was honored for his work on his thesis, which was entitled “A MyoD-Regulated Long Non-Coding RNA Regulates Skeletal Muscle Differentiation.”
Beatrice A. Walton ’14 won a Hoopes for her thesis entitled "Strategizing Justice: NGOs in Russia and the Cases Against Russia Before the European Court of Human Rights, 1998 - 2010.” She said the project was also the result of years of preparation—from taking Russian during freshman year to spending the past summer doing research in Russia and France.
However, Walton said she sees her Hoopes prize as a beginning rather than an end to her research.
“It’s sort of a relief. It makes you proud to know other people found your work interesting and important in some way,” Walton said. “It’s nice to have accomplished a first project but hopefully there’ll be more projects in the future.”
Walton hopes to continue her studies in the United Kingdom this summer and plans on using her prize money to travel throughout Europe and Morocco.
Rachel A. Gladstone ’14 was in the immigration office of Logan Airport when a friend called to tell her she had a won a prize for her thesis on cardiac regeneration.
After spending 20 to 30 hours per week researching in the lab, Gladstone said she appreciated being recognized, but credited her advisors’ support as well.
“[I] had phenomenal advisors,” Gladstone said. “More than half of the award is because of their help and contributions.”
Gladstone plans on continuing to do cardiology research next year in a clinical setting, but she first plans to spend her prize money on a cross-country road trip this summer.
Daniel J. Frim ’14 won his second Hoopes prize for a thesis on folklore and mythology in Jewish text. Frim also received the coveted honor last year for his research on a “Mythological Motif in the Jewish Babylonian Aramaic Incantation Bowls.”
“It came as a surprise both times,” Frim said. “I was very pleased and honored both times.”
According to Secretary of the Faculty Susan L. Lively, the only junior to win a Hoopes this year was Alexander G. Krolewski ’15, for his submitted essay on luminosity and black hole mass.
A full list of winners is below:
Amsale Alemu '14, Levent H. A. Alpöge '14, Victoria A. Baena '14, Sascha Bercovitch '14, Madeleine F. Bersin '14, Ian C. Boothby '14, Haley Bowen '14, Amy W. Bridge '14, Elizabeth H.
