After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I came home from work one day in July to some alarming news: A gunman had opened fire and killed three people at Ateneo de Manila University, my parents’ alma mater and one of the most prestigious institutions of higher learning in the Philippines.
According to police, the suspect had a long-running feud with one of his victims, an Ateneo parent and the former mayor of Lamitan, the suspect’s town. The dispute began in 2019, when the suspect’s unlicensed medical practice was shut down by the regional government. He blamed the mayor, publicly accusing her of corruption and drug trafficking — grave and highly political charges in the Philippines, where thousands of extrajudicial killings have taken place in recent years as part of former President Rodrigo Duterte’s blood-soaked war on drugs.
In short order, my thoughts drifted from my parents’ college to my own future alma mater. Like at Ateneo, many spaces on Harvard’s campus can be accessed by unauthorized persons with relative ease. Just last semester, a team of YouTubers snuck into at least two large lecture halls and would likely have gone unnoticed if not for the disruptive prank video they were filming. Surely, actors with less benign intentions could do worse.
But this op-ed is not about the security of Harvard’s campus. It is about how, at a university separated by thousands of miles but just a generation’s difference from where my parents studied, I am spared from encountering similar extrajudicial killings while pursuing my education — it is about, in other words, the privilege of security that comes with living in America.
Admittedly, American cities don’t exactly scream “security,” especially not at night, and especially not at night for women, and especially not at night for women who live in states where abortion has been banned or will be banned imminently. And neither does the southern border, where migrants sometimes die of heat exhaustion in sweltering tractor-trailers because of a legal migration system so dysfunctional that smuggling humans is, in some sense, the safest option.
What I mean to say is: Yes, there may be millions of Americans who have to live every day knowing that their lives could be taken away by a guy with a gun, for no reason other than the place they grew up, the color of their skin, or the clothes they wear, for no reason other than being at the wrong place at the wrong time, for absolutely no reason at all — but at least if I die in America, it won’t be because my neighbor thought I was on drugs and shot me dead because the president told him to.
Gratitude is a tricky concept to navigate. There are times when I look around at what’s going on in this country — the Supreme Court poised to strike down affirmative action, hundreds of elected Republican officials refusing to accept electoral defeat, state governors shipping immigrants around with no prior arrangements for housing or jobs — and decide I want no part of it.
It is also during these times that I am most acutely aware of the privilege this nation has given me. Because I was born in America, I have the luxury to choose whether I stay or leave. And, regardless of my choice, I have the luxury of living in a safe place. I have these privileges only because my parents made sacrifices to raise me in the kind of city that allows one to end up at Harvard. So I don’t know if I can look around at what’s going on in this country and still say that I like it here, but I also don’t know if I can look my parents in the eye and tell them that I don’t.
Like my own feelings, America’s politics of gratitude is deeply confused: about what gratitude actually looks like, what we should be grateful for, and to whom our gratitude is owed. Today, one is marked ungrateful (read: “anti-American”) for pointing out the ills of America’s institutions or holding opinions that diverge from red-white-and-blue tradition. But to defend tradition for tradition’s sake because of some unexamined belief in America’s greatness is empty gratitude. We cannot claim to be grateful for the genuine achievements of this country while censuring those who seek no more than to hold America to its highest ideals. True gratitude requires honesty, a willingness to confront the moments when America, though good, has failed to be great.
As a first-generation immigrant, I think the only tenable stance I can take is one of heavy, intense, and crushing gratitude. I find myself pinned under the weight of words like “If you don’t like it here, then leave,” pinned under the weight of dead bodies in the Philippines, pinned under the weight of the sacrifices my parents made so that our family could live here, pinned under the weight of the fact that this is all I have ever known. Don’t think for a second that my yearning for change comes from a place of ingratitude. As confusing and painful as it can be to think about sometimes, I am grateful to be an American. That gratitude — firmly rooted in the hope that this country can be great — is why we should all want America to become better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I still remember my first meal in Annenberg — one that came years before I got my Harvard acceptance. I sat in awe, looking at the boundless ceilings and stately busks of what would eventually become my first-year dining hall. This was in eighth grade, on a field trip meant to get our class excited about high school and the journey to college.
Growing up and attending public school in Cambridge was a luxury. Just last year, my old high school, Cambridge Rindge & Latin, spent an average of nearly $19,000 on every student, far above the national average. My history teacher senior year attended Harvard and was a Rhodes Scholar; graduating seniors moved on to Ivies and other prestigious universities across the country. The feeder-school system worked seamlessly for many students.
Beneath all of these amazing opportunities, however, lay striking inequality. Cambridge Rindge & Latin is constituted by an odd mix of both the uber-wealthy and the extremely disadvantaged. Many students are the children of the elite, and of prestigious Harvard and MIT academics — yet 43 percent of the school is low-income, with most of these students living in affordable housing units across the city. In a certain light, this is a remarkable accomplishment: Cambridge has the highest rent in the state, yet has managed to achieve meaningful socioeconomic diversity in its public school system.
However, this acute economic stratification, as well-intentioned and against-the-grain as it may have been, resulted in social stratification. As with many places — including Harvard — Cambridge Rindge & Latin was socially segmented along the lines of class and race.
As for your narrator: I occupied an odd place within this complex social matrix. I grew up in public housing and didn’t have the same advantages as many of my peers. Yet, my central friend group was fairly wealthy and from highly-educated families. We initially connected over interests such as playing pick-up basketball, chatting over games of Fortnite, and biking to school each morning. The socioeconomic discrepancies had no bearing on our relationships and never emerged in conversation. However, in a paradigmatic example of high school anxiety, it was something I secretly worried about. I didn’t start inviting people over to my house regularly until senior year — I was concerned that I didn’t have enough space or a nice enough layout to host large groups, that my house lacked the sophistication which was present in the homes of other peers. Some of my high school friends have, to this day, only visited my house once or twice.
Transitioning to Harvard felt like a fresh start, even though it was only two blocks away from Cambridge Rindge & Latin. College is an equalizer of sorts — we’re all given the same dorms, the same minimal guidance, and our newly distant childhood can finally be reflected upon with some perspective. Further, and perhaps shockingly, the culture at Harvard is highly conducive to exploring the impact of socioeconomic background. Just last week, I attended an Eliot House FGLI mixer where I talked to resident tutors and peers about their low-income and first-gen backgrounds. Being in this environment for over a year has made it quite easy to talk and even write openly about my fiscal situation — a welcome change since high school.
Despite this improvement, college has created new and more subtle social barriers, all of which are predicated on wealth. Friendships are formed in a new, more particular, manner. People no longer bond over pick-up basketball and biking to classes. Instead, we choose friends by using subtle cues about background, political affiliation, and socioeconomic status, curating social groups that reflect our carefully selected priorities. Discussions about wealth are more normalized in college, yet socioeconomic status seems to matter more. It feels natural to choose friends based on which authors they have read and whose philosophies they endorse. Wealth, however, is behind the curtain of all of these markers.
In an odd, almost perverse sense, I miss my worries from high school. Yes, I was consistently concerned about discussing my socioeconomic situation with friends; however, had I gotten over this personal stigma, the problem would have vanished. My friends likely would not have cared about my house, or my unique socioeconomic status in the friend group. If anything, our relationships would have deepened.
Our tendency to sort our peers based on wealth in college is an entirely different problem than social stigma. It’s both blameless and pernicious. It’s a great thing that we have matured, and can select friends with similar preferences and tastes. Yet, there was something beautiful about friendships being formed in such an innocuous setting, before any of our self-defining sensibilities even had the chance to develop.
Beyond recognition, there is not much of a solution to our sorting mechanisms for relationships in college. Conversations necessarily revolve around shared interests, which are grounded in wealth and childhood exposure. At the very least, we can be more conscious about how we select friends, and try to look past some of the first markers we choose when creating relationships.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a Tuesday meeting, the Cambridge City Council resolved to ban the licensing of limited-services pregnancy centers — establishments that can resemble abortion centers but often counsel against abortion services — though legal and constitutional questions remain.
During the Ordinance Committee's meeting, councilors discussed a proposed amendment to municipal law that would prohibit the city from licensing establishments that “present themselves as providing pregnancy related services but instead seek to persuade people against having an abortion,” according to the amendment’s text.
The amendment also seeks to prevent any limited-services pregnancy center — commonly known as crisis pregnancy centers — from publishing information in print or online that it “knows or reasonably should know” to be “deceptive, whether by statement or omission.”
But an opinion delivered by Cambridge’s City Solicitor Nancy E. Glowa raised doubts about the legality of the amendment. She argued that the restrictions on publishing information could violate the 1st Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and the 16th Amendment of the Massachusetts Constitution.
“Our opinion is that this could be an unconstitutional regulation of free speech,” Glowa said in the meeting.
She said the amendment as written may not pass a “strict scrutiny” test if reviewed by a court. The strict scrutiny standard would require the city to demonstrate that the amendment “furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.”
Councilor Patricia “Patty” M. Nolan ’80, a co-sponsor of the amendment, said the Council will “take into account” the legal questions and try to pass a version of the amendment that is “narrowly enough construed” to pass constitutional muster.
“The goal, I think, of the Council is to do all we can to ensure that there’s not deceptive information being promulgated in the city,” Nolan said in an interview after the meeting.
Limited-services pregnancy centers have come under heightened scrutiny following the Supreme Court’s decision over the summer to overturn Roe v. Wade. Critics allege the centers target pregnant women and give the misleading impression that they are medical facilities or provide abortions.
“These fake clinics claim to be providing just information and support for all options when in fact they do not,” Nolan said. “They provide wrong information about the options, and they provide a lot of pressure to choose only two of three options: either adoption, or carrying the pregnancy to term.”
During the public comment portion of the meeting, ten speakers — including the executive director of a Boston-based limited-services pregnancy center — spoke against the proposal. None spoke in favor.
The proposal follows the example of Somerville, whose city council banned limited-services pregnancy centers in March. In July, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura T. Healy ’92 also issued a consumer advisory warning of the “limited and potentially misleading nature” of the centers, according to a press release.
In Cambridge, as in Somerville, the ban would be preemptive; currently, no limited services pregnancy centers operate in either city, though some exist throughout the Boston area.
The Council voted to hold a second Ordinance Committee meeting at a later date to further discuss the amendment. It also directed the city solicitor to consult with Somerville’s law department on the legal justification behind its ban.

Harvard professor and astrophysicist Abraham “Avi” Loeb is preparing to search the Pacific Ocean floor for fragments of an interstellar meteor and potential alien technology.
Loeb hopes to recover pieces of CNEOS 2014-01-08, a meteor of an estimated 500 kilograms originally observed off the coast of Papua New Guinea in 2014. He has received full funding — $1.5 million — to finance the expedition through contributions from wealthy donors, he wrote in an email.
Loeb said in an interview that his team will be searching one centimeter into the ocean floor for small fragments of the meteor.
“This meteor actually disintegrated presumably into small fragments, so we are not looking for one big chunk,” he said. “We just need a few grams of material — that’s all, a few grams — to be able to tell the composition.”
“We are trying to localize the impact site — localizing as much as possible,” he added.
Loeb acknowledged that the fragments could have moved over the course of the eight years since the meteor’s discovery.
“We have a map of the ocean floor in that region and we also know the currents that existed back in 2014,” he said. “So we know whether it’s moving away from the site.”
CNEOS-2014-01-08 is of particular interest to Loeb because he believes the object could be artificial in origin or hold equipment from alien civilizations.
“People say ‘Oh, it’s just a space rock. We saw so many space rocks in the past. What’s new about it?’” he said. “It’s the first one that came from outside the solar system and, second, it’s tougher than 99.7 percent of everything we have seen.”
“We should be able to tell what its origin is — whether it’s an artificial alloy, for example, if it were a spacecraft of another technological civilization,” Loeb added.
Loeb’s plan has gotten attention from his peers. In an email, Martin Elvis, senior astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics, pointed out potential challenges that Loeb’s project could face.
“Pinning down the impact site to some reasonable area has to be the big challenge. Forty square miles is daunting. CNEOS 2014-01-08 was small to begin with (about 2 feet across),” Elvis wrote in an email. “It had to lose a lot of mass coming through the atmosphere, so even if it stayed intact it is a small target.”
Still, Elvis discussed the high potential upside of the project.
“I thought it was a good example of ‘high risk/high payoff’ science. Everyone professes to like such research, but they rarely do it in practice. Sure, they could well fail, but if they succeed then they will have found our first macroscopic sample of material from beyond our Solar System,” he wrote. “That’s the sort of mission NASA would spend a billion dollars on. So I was happy that they were taking the plunge.”
Loeb addressed some of his peers who doubt his work.
“Experts want to say that everything we see in the sky can be explained by their past knowledge, but if we see something new, it cannot be explained by their past knowledge,” Loeb said. “So they have a problem with that because it challenges their expertise.”
“Because this story got publicity, then people want to step on any flower that rises above the grass level,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A month after Rodrigo Ventocilla Ventosilla, a transgender Harvard Kennedy School student from Peru, died in police custody in Indonesia, Harvard’s Institute of Politics hosted a forum Tuesday on the cultural and political backlash to the global transgender rights movement.
Kennedy School professor Erica Chenoweth moderated a panel discussion between Alexander L. Chen, founding director of the LGBTQ+ Advocacy Clinic at Harvard Law School; Jen Manion, an Amherst College professor of history, sexuality, and women’s and gender studies; and Nicholas Opiyo, a fellow at the Kennedy School’s Carr Center for Human Rights Policy.
The event began with a moment of silence in honor of Ventocilla, who died five days after he was detained by police in Bali while traveling on a honeymoon with his spouse, Sebastián Marallano.
“His family has called for an investigation into the circumstances of his death, a demand that HKS Dean Doug Elmendorf has reiterated,” Chenoweth said.
“Rodrigo was a tireless advocate of trans rights in Peru and while he was here at HKS,” Chenoweth added. “That his life was cut short is truly devastating.”
Chen, who is gay and transgender, said Ventocilla’s arrest and death in Indonesia “hit home for me personally in a particularly eerie way,” explaining that he was in Bali with his partner to celebrate their domestic partnership one week prior to Ventocilla’s death.
“For Rodrigo and Sebastian to have been there for their honeymoon — which was supposed to be an opportunity for them to celebrate their love, to sort of embark upon a relationship and a life together — and for it to end in this incredibly tragic and horrible way, is really just my worst fear,” Chen said.
Chen said while transgender people are now “more visible” and the trans rights movement is “more powerful” than it has ever been before, much work remains to be done.
“[That’s] an incredibly contingent and small amount of progress compared to the lived reality of the lives of millions of people around the world,” he said. “Most people live in secrecy. Most people live in shame, and in rejection, and being discriminated against and suffering from human rights abuses.”
“It’s depressing,” Chen added.
Opiyo, a Ugandan human rights lawyer, said he was more optimistic about the ongoing progress around the world to support trans rights.
“I see progress, I see resilience, I see inspiration,” Opiyo said. “We are coming from a point of denial to a point of engaging with the issue.”
Two decades ago, “nobody would even admit” in Uganda that transgender people existed in society, according to Opiyo.
“But 20 years on, that sort of belief is fading away,” Opiyo said. “People are confronting with the idea that — whether you like it or you don’t — there are trans people in our society, at all levels of society.”
Manion said that despite the violence and backlash transgender people continue to face, they are also optimistic about the future of the trans rights movement.
“We have already changed the world,” Manion said. “There’s no amount of hatred and bigotry that’s gonna undo all that we’ve done for the last 20 years.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
College students will weigh in on a number of questions put forth by the Harvard Undergraduate Association this week — ranging from the expansion of hot breakfast options to a College-wide holiday for Election Day.
The HUA solicited student input on seven questions in an email Tuesday morning. Three of the seven questions deal with changes to the newly formed Association’s bylaws and constitution.
The proposed changes include a clause that would allow the Association’s executive board to update the list of Harvard offices with which each officer’s team works — a power it currently lacks. Another change would see the Association’s governing documents updated to reflect their current financial guidelines.
In an optional question, the Association also solicited student feedback on changes it has already made to its governing documents in order to comply with the school’s Title IX regulations.
According to the Association’s current constitution, constitutional changes can only be ratified via a two-thirds majority vote in a school-wide referendum. Bylaw changes only require a simple majority.
The referendum also asks students whether they would support the expansion of hot breakfast options to each of Harvard’s upperclassman housing neighborhoods. Currently, hot breakfast is only served in Annenberg Hall and Quincy House.
The ballot also gauges student support for a College-recognized “Democracy Day” to be held on the federal Election Day.
The HUA’s predecessor, the Undergraduate Council, was set to release a similar referendum question last semester, but the initiative was removed in the eleventh hour after a lengthy debate between representatives from the UC and the Harvard Votes Challenge. Some HVC leaders argued that the results of the vote would be influenced by a controversial question appearing alongside it — whether to dissolve the UC entirely.
Though the HUA referendum question does not explicitly include the word “holiday,” HUA Co-President LyLena D. Estabine ’24 wrote in a message to The Crimson that the HUA is working with the Harvard Votes Challenge to advocate for a suspension of classes on Election Day.
Voting will close Wednesday evening at 9 p.m.
