After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every day, I wake up to the same tree peeking at me through my windows. As if on cue, each morning it comes to life with a burst of wind and greets me with a cheerful wave of its branches like it’s welcoming me into the excitement of a new day. As the leaves began to glow orange in the spirit of the season over the past few weeks, the tree reminded me of the philosophical quality that falling leaves seem to have.
Fall is, without a doubt, one of my favorite times of year (though I can imagine that to pick a favorite season would be like choosing a favorite child). Having grown up in South Florida, I was a virgin to foliage until moving to Cambridge, unaware of how the psychedelic explosion of colors and romance of falling leaves could have the capacity to stir previously unearthed emotions and creativity. If you’ve ever been lucky enough to be caught in a whirlwind of spinning leaves you can perhaps understand what I mean; among that tornado of dancing embers, it feels only natural to want to spin, too. It’s the only time of year you can waltz with Mother Nature in this way.
For me, it’s during these months that I’m the most reflective. As the leaves detach themselves from their mother trunks and toddle relaxedly through the air, my thoughts too wander far from their home base. I see the falling debris swept up with gusts of wind, left to tenderly drift through the air, and I can’t help but think each of the trees is performing an encore to end what has been a fabulous show. With winter in sight, they execute one final song to embrace us in an all-encompassing symphony of blazing colors, whispering branches, and descending leaves.
Most excitedly, they include us in this show. What is fall without the sound of leaves crunching beneath our boots? I always feel like those crunches are invitations to dance; the trees asking us to be their partners as they swirl and twist with the breeze.
These few weeks of autumn are a time of transition. Right now, all around us, life is turning to death and I’m always caught off guard to realize how gorgeous this natural transformation is meant to be.
We’re always told to fear the aging process, to enjoy our youth before the senility of old age creeps upon us. Aging is grossly and wrongly associated with slowness. As if to slow down would be so unbearable, anyway. In a society that falsely measures the worth of its individuals in terms of use, those past a certain age are robbed of their humanhood.
What could be the most celebratory, intimate, and reflective phase of life has turned into something so many people fear and try to suppress. Menageries of marketing campaigns promote anti-aging beauty products promising to replace aging skin with the false glow of youth. I see it as a shame to cover the marks left on a body; we’re told to cover the art a well-lived life has left on our skin, to be ashamed of the lines left by a lifetime of laughing and crying.
Contrasting our collective fear of death is the calmness with which the trees I see around me now have in entering their final stage of life. Fall is sure of its place; quiet in its actions and reflective of self. While playing in the park during this time of year, young children juxtapose themselves among the fallen leaves. Life mixes with death, fertility plays in the surprising warmth of decomposition.
I wish there was a way to collectively reframe what it means to grow old. It’s a sublime phase of life deserving of pleasure, philosophical thought, and connection. It represents the coming back home of a person to themselves; a time to look back on a life lived and understand what it all has meant and what it can continue to mean from this point forward. It can be the pinnacle of existence; in the same way that the leaves around us are peaking in color, those entering the Winter of life are more often than not peaking in their own love, creativity, and vitality as well.
Aging of the body does not connote aging of the spirit. With the decline of the earthly vices and the responsibilities that often accompany those younger years, the spirit is finally given room to expand. Without the constriction imposed by the duties inherent to being young, a person can do away with the world’s judgment of them and, more importantly, expectation for them. Freedom during aging comes in having the wisdom to give more worth to the increased spiritual strength than to the decreased physical ability that accompanies those years.
So as I watch the friendly tree outside of my dorm room shed its leaves, I liken it to a composer instructing an orchestra through a bittersweet decrescendo. It dances and sings, contagious with its own love of life. The scars on its trunk mark places where branches used to be and offer a shallow glimpse into its lifetime of experiences.
It makes me hope that when it comes time to shed my own leaves and enter Winter, I do so with the grace of trees I see around me now. I dream my final song is as all-consuming as the symphony of Fall, and if it's just a mere echo, I’ll be proud even of that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I first got to college in the fall of 2020, I, like most of my classmates, had a few concerns about how the year would unfold in the middle of a pandemic. Would we ever receive hot food? Would I ever learn the heights of my professors? Would I ever see the inside of one of Harvard’s many libraries? In addition to these universal questions, I was also worried about health: How would I exercise in quarantine? Would mental health services be readily available for students should they need them?
Worrying about staying in shape, mentally and physically, made me think about the body positivity movement. The more I worried, however, the more I started scrutinizing the movement. Feeling confident and comfortable is a struggle for many people of all ages, shapes, and sizes. As a college student, I’ve heard many stories about the so-called “Freshman Fifteen,” and arriving on campus for the first time only exacerbated my concerns.
The body positivity movement may seem a relatively recent social phenomenon, but its roots extend further back than some think: In 1969, a man named Bill Farbey grew angry over the way strangers treated his overweight wife. Farbey would go on to create the National Association to Aid Fat Americans — which, now the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance, is the oldest fat-rights organization.
Over the past few years, however, the body positivity movement has gained tremendous momentum — in a sense, the movement has been reborn. With plus-sized models and people of every shape and size being celebrated on magazine covers and across many media platforms, it seems we have made some progress in promoting body positivity.
It is refreshing and encouraging to see mental and emotional health so openly discussed. But the body positivity movement is lacking in one critical respect: physical health.
For many, body positivity may elicit a strong response. What do you think of when you hear the words “body positivity?” The movement is a critical, necessary means to ensure every person feels comfortable and confident in their skin. No one deserves to be shamed, excluded, or discriminated against for their size. But, for many people, the movement elicits strong negative reactions due to its failure to also encourage physical health. In doing so, it fails to highlight the tragic and preventable physiological effects of obesity.
These strong views, however, are not necessarily in conflict with one another. I believe it is incredibly important to love and be kind to oneself. I also believe that body positivity is an action. Managing stress and anxiety, getting enough sleep, exercising, and eating a healthy diet are all part of body positivity that require active participation. Physical and mental health should not be seen as mutually exclusive. Mental and physical health, together, should be considered the fundamental pillars of body positivity-oriented action.
With the direction of Americans’ diets and health, in particular, we must capitalize on a heightened focus on body positivity that encourages healthy living. Between 2017 and 2018 in the United States alone, the adult obesity prevalence was 42.4 percent in adults. In 2008, the estimated annual medical cost of obesity in the United States was $147 billion, and it has only continued to rise. Diseases caused by obesity, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers, are among the leading causes of preventable and premature deaths in the United States.
An estimated 2.8 million adults die each year from preventable, obesity-caused illnesses. Ultimately, it is important to bear in mind that obesity is a comorbidity for a long list of chronic, degenerative illnesses. Understanding the consequences of our physical care is not fatphobia; it is the necessary recognition of a health crisis that will only worsen if we dismiss promotions of healthy habits immediately as fatphobia.
On the whole, we have failed to consider body positivity as both a mental and physical action-related mindset. The media has long promoted bodies that are too thin, and as we reshape our own attitude toward our own health, we must consider all angles and components of a movement that first began as a husband’s mission to help his wife.
We still have a long way to go in Bill Farbey’s mission. While the movement has been critical to dispelling the toxic culture that has promoted eating disorders, body dysmorphia, and unhealthy mental habits, according to Deloitte’s report on the social and economic cost of eating disorders, approximately 21 million Americans between 2018 and 2019 had eating disorders at some point in their lifetimes.
The body positivity movement has done important work encouraging mental health and self-love and that must continue — but it is utterly failing to remind us that physical health, too, is just as important. As we reconsider the body positivity movement, we must work to promote healthy lifestyles.

Harvard is throwing money at its faculty diversity problem — and it might just help. Earlier this month in its annual report, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences defied the University’s projections for a budget deficit and ended the 2021 fiscal year with a $51 million surplus; within days, FAS Dean Claudine Gay outlined a plan to direct some of these unexpected funds towards diversifying FAS’s faculty. The proposed initiative would invest heavily in procuring a robust, representative pool of applicants through “high quality,” “labor intensive” searches, aiming to identify and recruit rising scholars from a variety of backgrounds.
Dean Gay’s proposal embodies a laudable sentiment, one that Harvard — at FAS and beyond — hasn’t always lived up to. Increasing minority representation among faculty is vital. As of 2021, only 8 percent of all tenured FAS faculty are Latinx, Black, or Native American. Only a quarter of those individuals, 14 professors, identified as women, a number dwarfed by the 325 tenured white, male professors. We have expressed our regret at how academics of color, from Cornel R. West ’74 to Lorgia García Peña, have been disregarded by our institution. Indeed, our faculty might not need diversity efforts quite so direly if we didn’t keep losing talented minds by denying them tenure.
From a student perspective alone, it is worth pondering the emotional and psychological impact of rarely seeing scholars of your background reflected at the highest academic level. Not that our faculty’s demographic make-up is solely a symbolic matter: Faculty homogeneity inevitably reduces the perspectives included in academic pursuits, rendering us vulnerable to significant blind spots. The breadth, depth, and quality of our scholarly work are negatively affected, limiting students’ ability to study topics or even entire fields that cannot be found in our departments.
Examples of these detrimental effects abound. Computer scientists have been coding algorithms and advancing artificial intelligence for decades. But without researchers like MIT’s Joy Buolamwini, a Black woman and founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, how long might it have taken her field and the Big Tech companies it supports to notice the biases present in facial recognition software? On our own stretch of the Charles, Professor Roland G. Fryer Jr.’s departure (and prompt return) after allegations of sexual misconduct illustrate the extent to which relying on too few faculty members of color to bring representation and academic insight to a field is entirely unsustainable.
Of course, identifying a worthwhile goal doesn’t mean fulfilling it. While we find Dean Gay’s proposal encouraging, we are skeptical that it fully adresses our current paradigm. Her focus is sharply on the earliest stage of acquiring and retaining diverse faculty; Harvard’s recent track record suggests the issue might lie at least partially in their final stages of granting tenure. As both West and Garcia prove — and as our board has opined before — the current tenure system is less than perfect. The rosy results of Harvard’s tenure process review aside (which did not investigate the potential impact of race on tenure decisions), the existing system is opaque and inspires little confidence. It also relies heavily on inherently subjective peer recommendations that can benefit those from backgrounds better represented and entrenched in academia. While the inclusion of more diverse candidates at the onset of the hiring process is sure to be helpful, it can’t blind us to the fact that even ideal inputs cannot fix a broken system.
Our diversity efforts must therefore be continuous in character, rather than focused exclusively on initial recruitment. They should also aim to address specific diversity gaps across certain departments, fields, and interests. The sciences, for example, report even worse diversity metrics than the FAS as a whole. The entire tenured engineering faculty includes exactly zero female professors from underrepresented minority backgrounds.
Further, we yet again lend our support to student calls for an ethnic studies program. Earlier this semester, alumni donated $45 million for an Asian American studies program, lauding Dean Gay’s “vision to advance racial justice by attracting exceptional faculty.” On the tails of this windfall, cited monetary concerns for stalling ethnic studies should no longer apply; when the administration makes justifications based on financial constraints, these decisions need to be re-justified when fortunes change, as they have here. With our current budget surplus and new donations, we strongly encourage the administration to genuinely commit to building an ethnic studies department, with its broad, intellectually and demographically diversifying potential.
When it comes to diversity, and in the spirit of algorithmic fairness, the administration cannot stop at getting better inputs. It needs to fix the rest of the process, too — tenure allotment, ethnic studies, and discipline-specific gaps alike.

Dharma, Harvard’s Hindu students’ association, hosted a prayer service and home-cooked dinner on Saturday evening in celebration of Diwali, the five-day festival of lights celebrated throughout South Asia.
Though Diwali began on Nov. 4 this year, Dharma typically hosts an annual celebration and dinner the weekend after, inviting students from across the College to enjoy food cooked by seniors in Dharma, share stories, and partake in puja, a devotional prayer service.
This year’s event, which attracted around 150 attendees, was organized by Dharma seniors Nikita Jindal ’22 and Palak V. Shah ’22.
Jindal said one of her favorite parts of Dharma’s Diwali event is that it brings together South Asian students across Harvard, even those who are not typically as involved with Dharma or who celebrate the holiday in different ways at home.
“Oftentimes at this part of the year, people are really, really missing home. And I think this is just a really warm and welcoming space for people to just come together and celebrate something that they all have in common,” Jindal said.
This year’s festivities were particularly meaningful following over a year of online Dharma celebrations, the organizers said.
“One of the moments that just really struck me about how wonderful it was to be back in a space together was when every person in the living room was chanting the puja together,” Shah said. “It just felt so collective and so beautiful. And that’s something that you can never really replicate on Zoom or online.”
Dharma hosted the event at the Mather House Faculty Dean residence. Mather Faculty Dean L. “Maha” Mahadevan said he enjoyed seeing students from all different backgrounds come together for the festival.
“It’s just wonderful that our students have this way of celebrating what is important to them,” Mahadevan said. “It’s wonderful that they also get people from all over South Asia, but not only South Asia.”
Tara V. Nadella ’24 said one of her favorite parts of the celebration was the presence of “welcoming” faculty like Mahadevan, in addition to the students.
“They’re so warm and they’re just the kindest people,” Nadella said of the faculty attendees. “It’s special to also have the faculty be a part of it.”
Some Dharma seniors began preparing the home-cooked food for the event the night before. Shah said preparing dinner was one of the most fun parts of this year’s Dharma celebration.
“It was so much fun, we were playing music, taste testing each other’s dishes, FaceTiming our moms,” Shah said. “It was nice to just work together and get this done.”
Anushka S. Jetly ’24 said she is grateful for the work that Dharma organizers put into the event.
“At home, we never did a whole lot, but it’s nice here to see there’s such a community that’s getting so involved,” Jetly said.

The Harvard-Allston task force penned a letter Wednesday to University President Lawrence S. Bacow calling for greater “accountability” and outreach around Harvard’s Enterprise Research Campus development, two weeks after submitting a comment letter to Boston City Hall raising concerns about the project.
The Nov. 10 letter, which was signed by 13 of the task force’s 15 members, praised the University’s long history of leadership but wrote the task force is “deeply disappointed” by an alleged lack of collaboration between Harvard and Allston residents.
In the letter, the signatories asked to meet with Harvard planners and administrators — including newly-appointed University Planning and Design director Purnima Kapur — to learn from their “extensive experience” and convey to them residents’ concerns.
Task force members also called on Harvard to “take the lead” in combating climate change’s impact on the Allston-Brighton neighborhood by instituting a “greenspace planning initiative” reflective of Harvard’s previous work in climate change, public health, and equity.
“We join the Boston Parks and Recreation Commission in calling on Harvard to plan greenspace first, so that development weaves around a green resilient network, rather than buildings coming first, forcing greenspace to go into ‘pocket parks’ and ‘sidewalk rooms’ as the current framework plan suggests,” the letter reads.
More housing is needed, per the letter, but task force members wrote they have seen “no proposals” that meet the neighborhood’s needs.
“The current process in Allston of ground leasing parcels one by one to private developers leaves no room for such innovations as community land trusts, cooperative housing, and other approaches to social housing,” the signatories added.
Task force members wrote they desire more comprehensive “workforce development” and training initiatives in Allston, spearheaded by Harvard, instead of by individual developers. Harvard development, according to the signatories, will create a need for jobs, including jobs in land development, building management, and retail.
The members also wrote that they were concerned with what they view as a piecemeal transit plan by Harvard and its associated developers.
“Harvard’s partners have offered vague and unenforceable suggestions for adding to public transit service or reducing vehicular share, but in the absence of a holistic analysis of regional traffic volumes and patterns, the essential issue of transportation cannot be properly addressed,” they wrote.
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement that the University and local residents share similar goals in Allston development.
“President Bacow and Harvard appreciate the thorough feedback from members of the Harvard Allston Task Force, and look forward to the continued collaboration as we work to advance our shared goals of creating a vibrant, equitable and welcoming district that compliments and enriches the existing Allston-Brighton neighborhood,” she wrote.

Legal and bioethics experts convened to discuss the prevalence of health misinformation in the Covid era and how to combat it at a virtual panel hosted by the Harvard Medical School Center for Bioethics on Friday.
The event, called “Watching This Talk Will Save Your Life: Dealing with Health Misinformation in the COVID Era,” was moderated by Michael S. Sinha, a researcher at the Harvard-MIT Center for Regulatory Science at Harvard Medical School.
The panelists included University of Pennsylvania communications professor Joseph N. Cappella and Northeastern University law and public policy professor Wendy E. Parmet.
Capella first began by discussing how health misinformation and disinformation are effective tools to sow distrust of authoritative health information. He cited an example of New York City’s Polish population being targeted by outside political agitators who claimed that mRNA vaccines were crafted to decimate Christianity and the Polish nation.
Additionally, he highlighted an October 2020 study conducted in the U.S. and the U.K. that found that participants were less likely to get vaccinated after exposure to just a few pieces of misinformation.
Parmet discussed the legal debates over health misinformation, saying that conservatives on the Supreme Court have begun shifting toward a stricter examination of regulations on speech, potentially allowing health misinformation to propagate even further.
“Traditionally, public health has always been a compelling state interest,” Parmet said. “I will say that last month, kind of shocking to me, three justices on the Supreme Court, in a decision refusing to take a vaccine case, suggested that it wasn’t clear that stopping the pandemic or protecting people from Covid-19 would remain a compelling state interest.”
“It’s hard to know: if that’s not a compelling state interest, what is a compelling state interest?” he added.
In an interview after the event, Parmet discussed the larger trend of the Supreme Court striking down policies meant to stop the spread of Covid-19, such as lockdowns and eviction moratoriums.
“The Court has been very hostile to Covid mitigation regulations,” Parmet said. “But it has also been exceptionally, pre-Covid, hostile to speech restrictions.”
In assigning responsibility to the widespread presence of misinformation, Capella blamed both legacy media outlets and social media.
“Groups like Fox News, have a bias that's political. And so they’re covering the misinformation because they have a political agenda in mind and they’re trying to pursue that political agenda,” Capella said.
He added in an interview following the event that some well-intentioned journalists also help spread misinformation by giving it a platform.
“Try not to repeat misinformation if you can avoid it,” Capella said. “And don’t pick up every tidbit of this information that’s out there and give it a place in the journalistic enterprise.”
In terms of the role of social media in the dissemination of misinformation, Capella pointed to a landmark MIT study from 2017, which found that falsehoods spread “farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly” on social media than true information.
In suggesting solutions to impeding the spread of misinformation, Sinha highlighted the importance of spending time listening.
“I would say we need to spend more time with those who see us as trusted resources. It’s a matter of having a conversation that allows individuals to be seen and heard,” Sinha said in an interview after the event.
Capella emphasized being empathetic when discussing misinformation in a post-panel interview.
“I do think that there is no easy way of bridging some of these fundamental divides, which are really not so much about information, as they are often about identity, and they are often about values that are behind the information,” Capella said.
“I think the best that one can do is to try to be empathic — try to keep the lines of communication open, provide information to the other person, and allow them the freedom to make up their own minds, but provide them with additional information to help them move from where they are,” he added.

After a contentious Undergraduate Council presidential election, Michael Y. Cheng ’22 and Emmett E. de Kanter ’24, who pledged to “Defund the UC” and rewrite the UC constitution, were elected president and vice president Saturday, the UC’s Election Commission announced in an email.
The UC presidential election used ranked-choice voting, which allowed voters to rank as many of the six campaigns in any order of their preference. Cheng won 708 first-place votes, the most of any of the candidates. The ticket of Esther J. Xiang ’23 came in second with 623 first-place votes.
The UC election also asked students two referenda questions. When asked if the University should eliminate the use of legacy preferences in undergraduate admission, 59.56 percent were in favor and 40.43 percent were opposed.
The second referendum question asked whether the College should restore shopping week — the traditional period at the start of the semester when students can browse classes before finalizing their schedules — which students overwhelmingly supported, with 94.76 percent voting yes.
This year’s election saw 33.5 percent voter turnout, an increase from 28.2 percent the previous year.
In an interview Sunday, Cheng and de Kanter said they were shocked by their victory.
“I was so surprised, but really excited to actually do this because we had a plan and we’re actually going to do what we say,” Cheng said.
“I was also pretty flabbergasted,” de Kanter added. “The most common refrain in Mike’s room that night was ‘no way.’”
During a closed-door session of Sunday’s UC meeting, Council members discussed a recent internal poll that found the UC has a 22 percent student approval rating, according to Cheng, who was present at the meeting as a current UC representative for Quincy House.
“With the 60 percent of votes that went to explicitly anti-UC tickets as well as the UC’s internal poll showing the UC having an 22 percent approval rating, I do think we have a mandate from the student body to try to build a student government that is more effective,” Cheng said.
Jaron M. Zhou ’22, Cheng and de Kanter’s campaign manager, said their platform resonated with students who are disillusioned with the UC.
“We really spoke to the concerns of students,” he said. “They didn’t want small reforms. They didn’t want the same old campaign promises and nothing getting done. They wanted a complete reimagining of what the UC could be, and I think that’s what Michael and Emmett really campaigned on.”
Cheng and de Kanter claimed their “Defund the UC” campaign will provide student groups with more funding.
“One of the most fundamental misconceptions about the ‘Defund the UC’ platform is that the goal of these reforms is not to reduce funding for student organizations or student activities, but actually increase it by reducing inefficiencies within the student governmental processes,” de Kanter said.
Noah A. Harris ‘22 and Jenny Y. Gan ‘22, the current president and vice-president of the UC, expressed confidence in Cheng’s ability to lead in an interview Sunday.
“We both have known Michael for a really long time and are excited to get to know Emmett,” Gan said. “Michael, as a three-and-a-half year member of the Council, is really, really committed to the work that the UC does.”
Cheng said he is ready to get to work.
“First, we’re going to pass a specific timeline for a constitutional convention leading up to a referendum to replace the UC constitution with a constitution that the convention comes up with,” he said. “There’s a lot of really great ideas that we think we are going to try to get, and we’re starting even before we're inaugurated.”

Experts in immunology, epidemiology, and infectious diseases discussed the current state of the Covid-19 pandemic in a forum jointly presented by the Harvard School of Public Health and National Public Radio on Friday afternoon.
The event, entitled “Pandemic Update: Vaccines, Children, Equity, and More,” was moderated by Scott Hensley, senior health editor on NPR’s Science Desk. The panel featured HSPH professors Kizzmekia S. Corbett and William “Bill” P. Hanage, Massachusetts General Hospital infectious disease specialist Amir M. Mohareb, and Boston Childrens’ Hospital senior pediatrician Richard “Rick” Malley.
The forum began with a discussion surrounding the recent approval and rollout of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine to younger children.
Corbett kickstarted the conversation by emphasizing the safety of the vaccine.
“I think that parents, grandparents, and anyone else who is a guardian of a child need to understand that getting vaccines authorized and approved for any age group, whether it be adults, elderly people, and then, now, children, comes with a process that is highly vetted by the regulators at the Food and Drug Administration, and comes with a lot of data,” Corbett said.
Malley and Hanage then pointed out the value of administering Covid-19 vaccines to younger children, such as feelings of relief and comfort from knowing their child is protected from severe illness caused by Covid-19. Hanage said, however, that “the real headline impacts of the pandemic depend on the proportion of older people who have been vaccinated.”
The conversation then transitioned to vaccine inequities across the globe.
Mohareb said he believed the U.S. and other rich nations should donate their excess vaccines and supplies to countries with limited vaccination accessibility, but explained how money dictates how vaccinations are distributed.
“We do not distribute essential medicines and essential supplies based on human dignity or need. We distribute it based on money,” he said.
The panelists also discussed vaccine hesitancy and efforts to counter it, with a focus on listening to those with remaining questions rather than judging them.
“One of the ways in which we lose the [vaccine] debate is when we start being disrespectful of the fact that some people have genuine concerns, whether they are founded in science or in gut feeling or in misinformation from different websites,” Malley said.
Finally, the panelists shifted to the future of Covid-19, discussing new potential treatments and variants along with the need to keep preventative measures in place.
Hanage discussed these points from an epidemiologist’s perspective, explaining that “we cannot be sure” of Covid-19’s future, which will depend on levels of transmission and infection.
“If those [levels] remain relatively mild, then we might see, probably, seasonal peaks of disease, like the other coronaviruses,” Hanage said.
“There will continue to be people getting sick, and there will continue to be some people dying, and they will predominantly be older, but they will be far smaller in terms of numbers,” he added.
In order to reach this state and combat variants of Covid-19, Hange urges people to get vaccinated.
“We’re not out of the woods yet, even if we’re in a less woody part of the woods,” he said.

Sex health educator and writer Martha Kempner brought attention to how politicians spread misinformation on sexual health to further political agendas at an event Friday during the College’s annual Sex Week.
Students filed into an Emerson lecture hall Friday for the event, entitled “That’s Not How It F*cking Works: Debunking Sex-Related Myths & Legislation.”
Kempner started off her lecture — which addressed topics including rape, birth control, abortion, and sexually transmitted diseases — with a caution that she does not use trigger warnings for her discussion of sensitive subjects.
“I don’t give trigger warnings because I think my topic is like a giant trigger,” she said. “My general strategy is to be blunt.”
For example, when asked by a member of the audience for advice on how to talk about safe sex with their three younger brothers, Kempner encouraged them to be direct.
“Honestly, I would buy them some condoms,” she said, encouraging the audience member to inform their siblings that the two most important parts of safe sex are “condoms and consent.”
In contrast to Kempner’s progressive philosophy on sex education, she said some politicians spread misinformation to limit women’s control over their bodies.
Kempner blamed certain conservative political leaders for spreading misconceptions about sexual health, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), deceased talk radio host Rush Limbaugh, and former United States president George W. Bush.
She cited a controversy in 2012 when former U.S. Rep. Todd Akin (R-Mo.) claimed that restrictive abortion laws do not need exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest.
“If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down,” Akin falsely said in 2012, though he later stated that he “misspoke.”
Kempner argued that restrictive policies surrounding sex are designed to control female bodies. She cited arguments against forms of birth control that claim access leads to an increase in women having sex.
Those arguments say that “if we make this extra method of preganacy avoidance available, women will have too much sex,” Kempner said.
After the event, Kempner said the spread of misinformation on sex and pregnancy has a direct effect on women’s bodies. She urged audience members to consider politicians’ stances on sexual health when voting.
“I want to get people riled up and a little mad, and really motivated to vote,” she said. “I think that sometimes we don’t realize how much of an impact politicians have on our bodies, on our lives.”
Kempner also applauded Harvard’s Sex Week for creating a space to promote open conversations and dispel common misunderstandings about sex.
“I think colleges are way better at it than high school,” she said in terms of the overall quality of sex eduation.
“I think [college] is one of the first times that we all get to really openly talk about sex,” she added. “It’s fun to come to college and be honest about it for the first time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One year after Srikant M. Datar was named as Harvard Business School’s 11th dean, Harvard Business School students praised his efforts towards diversity and inclusion, but said they were disappointed with his engagement with second-year students and student organizations.
Datar took office Jan. 1, following former dean Nitin Nohria’s 10-year tenure. In a March 2021 interview with The Harbus, a news publication run by HBS students, Datar outlined three goals he wanted to work toward in his tenure — racial equity, diversity, and inclusion; technology and digital transformation; and partnerships with other Harvard schools.
Datar’s racial equity, diversity, and inclusion efforts come in the wake of the Business School’s Action Plan for Racial Equity, established by Nohria’s administration in September 2020. The initiative pledged to establish a diversity and inclusion office with a chief officer, recruit Black students and faculty, and develop a more racially representative curriculum.
Terrill L. Drake, whom Datar named Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer in September of this year, said the School has taken steps towards “laying the groundwork for culture change.”
“I think what is really important is setting forth an infrastructure that is really going to set the school up for years and years of success, and being able to progress and move forward,” Drake said.
In the past year, the School has established a diversity and inclusion office, recruited more diverse faculty — out of 13 individuals who accepted offers, eight were women and seven identified as people of color — and offered new courses around race and identity, per Drake.
Second-year MBA student Layeeka M. Ismail, who serves as co-president of HBS’s Islamic Society, said that she appreciated having Drake as a “figurehead.”
“He’s been very easy to get a hold of,” Ismail said. “We’ve had to reach out to him for some discussions on behalf of the Islamic Society, and he’s just been very receptive and open to meeting the students and hearing our feedback.”
Ismail said that since Datar’s tenure, she’s seen more diverse faculty who are conscious of efforts to increase diversity. She said one of her classes, taught by a newly-recruited faculty member, has featured “incredibly diverse” case protagonists this year.
Felicia Hanitio, a second-year MBA student and co-president of HBS’s Southeast Asia Club, said that though she believes diverse case protagonists have been better integrated into the curriculum this year, most of her professors are still white males.
“I know it takes time,” Hanitio said. “I would love to continue seeing progress in representation of faculty, too.”
On Datar’s second goal of digital transformation, Hanitio said the translation of digital skills into the curriculum has felt “piecemeal and “forced.” She said she hopes the school will continue to take student feedback into account and recruit the right faculty for the transformation.
HBS spokesperson Brian C. Kenny wrote in an emailed statement that efforts to bring data science into the curriculum are “still nascent” and Datar is working to accelerate them.
Keven D. Wang, a second-year MBA student and co-president of HBS’s Asian American Business Association, added that Datar’s third goal to partner with more schools is “important,” noting the potential of complementary co-founders, particularly engineers, in the “entrepreneurship realm.” Wang said this is currently challenging.
“Right now, we just don’t have enough resources to help us reach out to these schools to find these co-founders,” Wang said.
Additionally, several second-year HBS students said that they haven’t yet had the opportunity to meet the new dean.
Wang said he senses a broad sentiment of “disappointment” in Datar among his class, noting that Datar seems “a little bit reclusive” in engaging with the Class of 2022.
Wang explained that Datar gave a welcome speech to the incoming class of first-year students, but second-years did not receive the same engagement upon their return to campus a week later.
“So, in a sense, we were really never formally introduced to Dean Datar in an in-person setting, ever,” Wang said.
Wang added that the Class of 2022 attended the school in its hybrid model knowing that the experience would be “imperfect” and a somewhat “diminished HBS experience.”
“It’ll be a nice gesture if we got visibility from the dean from time to time,” Wang added.
Kenny wrote that though Datar did not speak at the second-year welcoming ceremony, he did remain after the event to greet and chat with students, and he is hosting weekly breakfast meetings with students.
“As much as he enjoys and prioritizes spending time with MBA students, as the Dean of HBS (and not just the MBA Program), Srikant must also accommodate the demands for his time from faculty, staff, University leadership, alumni, and others,” Kenny wrote.
Second-year MBA student Eduardo Ortiz Gross, who is co-president of HBS’s LatAm Club, said he wants to understand Datar’s formal communication strategy with students and club officials.
“I was kind of shocked that we [the LatAm Club] haven’t had any personal communication with him,” Gross said. “I remember seeing Dean Nohria at at least, maybe two or three Zoom calls with all of the students, or at webinars for all of the students. And that has not happened with Dean Datar.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Unreal.”
That is how field hockey head coach Tjerk van Herwaarden described how he was feeling after No. 12 Harvard beat No. 2 Michigan on its own turf to clinch a seat among the final four in NCAA Division I.
“Just to go into a weekend with [Louisville] and then having Michigan as the number two team in the country, you know you’re climbing up a steep hill,” van Herwaarden reflected.
“We’re very proud, and excited, but it still hasn’t sunk in at this moment.”
FRIDAY, NOV. 12: No. 12 HARVARD 1, No. 6 LOUISVILLE 0
Before the Crimson took down the Wolverines on Sunday, the team played a tight match against No. 6 University of Louisville on Phyllis Ocker Field in Ann Arbor, Mich. The win on Friday matched the team’s best NCAA tournament run since 2018, reaching the quarterfinal round for the second time in school history.
“Louisville is one of the best defensive teams in this country, which was also displayed in the game,” van Herwaarden remarked. “We are the best or the second-best defensive team in this country, so I knew it was going to be a defensive battle.”
“This weekend the defense has stepped up to a whole different level.”
Louisville, who appeared in the 2020 semifinals, fell to Harvard 1-0 in overtime. This marks only the second time the Cardinals have been shutout this season.
In the first quarter, neither team managed to have scoring opportunities. The second quarter remained tense as Harvard held two penalty corners, with senior and Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year Hannah Pearce just missing the net.
By the end of the first half, the score remained 0-0. Harvard held a 10-7 advantage in shots and a 6-4 lead in penalty corners.
The second half of the game provided more scoring chances for both the Cardinals and the Crimson with Louisville holding a 3-2 edge in shots. Junior Olivia Hoover made a shot just wide of the net. Harvard junior goalkeeper Ellie Shahbo, who holds the No. 1 save percentage (0.878) and No. 1 goals-against average (0.35) for all Division I goalkeepers in the country, made great saves against two penalty corners from Louisville.
At the end of the four quarters, the game remained scoreless, sending the game into overtime.
In the sixth minute of overtime, sophomore Avery Donahue broke the 0-0 score with a one-touch goal into the back of the net after receiving a feed from senior captain Mimi Tarrant, sending the Crimson to the quarterfinal round for the second time in program history.
SUNDAY, NOV. 14: No. 12 HARVARD 1, No. 2 MICHIGAN 0
After a three-hour game delay and snowfall, the Crimson took to Michigan’s own Ocker Field for an intense quarterfinal battle with the hosts for a spot among the final four.
In the third-ever meeting between the two teams, Michigan stood as one of the top offensive teams in the country with an average of 3.26 goals per game. However, that average did not hold for the matchup against defensive powerhouse Harvard, as the game remained scoreless for all four quarters.
In a quick first half, similar to the Louisville game on Friday, neither team was able to tally a shot. That was until the Wolverines pressured the Crimson with a penalty shot in the last minute before the half, though the shot went wide.
A penalty stroke, the most severe penalty in field hockey, was given to Harvard in the third quarter of the game, though it was overturned and kept the Wolverines from tallying a shot on the board. Near the end of the period, the Crimson managed a shot on Michigan goalkeeper Anna Spieker, though she pushed the shot away, marking her first save of the game. By the end of the third, Harvard held a 4-0 edge in shots.
In the fourth quarter, Michigan increased the pressure, holding a 6-0 edge in shots over the Crimson. Harvard was given a yellow card for an illegal substitution, granting Michigan a player advantage for the first five minutes of the first overtime period. The Wolverines scored off a penalty shot, but upon further review, the Michigan goal was overturned, and the score remained 0-0. The Crimson defense remained resilient, sending the game into a second overtime period.
One minute into the second overtime period, Michigan was handed two yellow cards, forcing the Wolverines into a tough six-on-four Crimson advantage. Despite being up two players, Harvard could not find the back of the net in the second overtime. Both teams survived corners, sending the game into a shootout.
“We knew it was going to be very limited moments that we would have anything going to the goal, so that it ended up going into overtime didn’t at all surprise me to that extent, and eventually taking it all the way to the shootout where we then dominated,” head coach van Herwaarden commented.
Harvard scored in its first three shootout attempts, with shots coming from senior midfielder/forward Rachel Greenwood and Tarrant, and the game-winning shot from sophomore midfielder/defender Isa Gooijer.
After saving the first two shots, standout Shahbo made a decisive save against Michigan’s Halle O’Neill to win the game, marking the Crimson’s highest-ranked opponent that it has defeated in school history.
NEXT UP: No. 7 NORTHWESTERN
On Friday afternoon, Harvard will return to Ocker Field to take on No. 7 Northwestern University in the Crimson’s first appearance in a Final Four game.
Northwestern beat 2020 NCAA championship title-holder North Carolina in the first round of the tournament last Friday and upset Iowa with a last-minute goal to send the Wildcats to the Final Four.
Whatever the outcome of Friday’s game may be, this NCAA Tournament run has made for a historic season in Harvard field hockey history. Holding the number one goals-against average (0.390), save percentage (0.860), and winning percentage (0.941) in the NCAA, Harvard has earned its spot among the final four.

19. “I hope you go to The Coop to buy some merch and you try to use a coupon or your student discount but the cashier doesn’t hear you properly and you pay full price.”
20. “I hope you get an email from the Harvard University Undergraduate Honor Council and you get really nervous because you think you accidentally plagiarized and you’re going to be expelled but it’s actually just a reminder not to cheat.”
