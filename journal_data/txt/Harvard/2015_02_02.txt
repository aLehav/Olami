After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By the time you finish reading this sentence, you could be halfway through a Vine.
Maybe you prefer the written word. If so, you’ve just passed the length of a full tweet.
Don’t get too comfortable with brevity: this column, which aims to fill up as much of your time as roughly 30 tweets, is about the danger of short attention spans, particularly on the Internet. For that reason, I need to make a self-conscious appeal before mounting my sermonizing pulpit.
To the reader: please commit either to reading—really reading—the entirety of this article or else to ducking out now, no hard feelings. Right hand or left hand: there is no middle option.
I’ll wait until the shuffling subsides.
Now back to business. As the examples of Vine and Twitter illustrate, the Internet has shrunk the attention span of the modern world. From numbered lists to short videos, we rely on bite-sized content. We are a generation of skimmers, and this is a problem.
There’s no reason to pick on Vine and Twitter exclusively. Very few mass websites require users to focus on one piece of content for more than a few glances. If you spend an hour pouring over a BuzzFeed list, then you are wasting your close-reading talents on the wrong piece. Likewise, scrolling through Facebook allows you to read through dozens of statuses in a matter of moments.
On the Internet, time is measured in seconds, and if you don’t believe me, experiment by watching a long YouTube ad when you have the option of skipping. Unless you are particularly interested in T-Mobile’s family plan, I predict a physically painful experience.
Science substantiates this observation of impatience. In 2006, Nielson Norman Group discovered that humans read articles online very differently than how they read them in physical form. Rather than going line by line, web users consume in an F-shaped pattern: read over the first line, scan over the next several, and pick up again when they find a key buzzword. If we don’t catch what we want at a glance, we close the tab and turn our attention elsewhere.
One explanation for this habit could be structural. With tricky devices such as recommended articles on BuzzFeed and external links on Twitter, the Internet never lets us focus on one page for too long. We’re like three-year-olds in Toys “R” Us, eyes darting around because we’re overwhelmed by the number of toys.
The other half of the explanation for short attention spans could be internal—the monster is inside us. We cave into repetitive clicking because we are unwilling to pay conscious attention to whatever is on the screen in front of us.
Skimming is mindless, which is why traveling through the rabbit hole of recommended videos on YouTube feels so draining, especially in the moment when you close out the browser. Theoretically, exposure to so many different images and sounds should swell my brain. Instead, skimming from 1:34 to 2:41, and from video to video, leaves me with a feeling of hollowness, like I haven’t learned anything at all.
Some might support the skimming lifestyle because of the perceived efficiency of the information that you’re receiving. As the theory goes, if a tweet can give you a news update in a few seconds, then why spend an extra minute reading an article on CNN that has the same information, just in a more grammatically palatable form?
This counter-argument misses the distinction between broad knowledge and deep knowledge. Breadth means watching two hours of Vine; depth means immersing yourself in a new movie.
By skewing towards breadth, the Internet accustoms us to getting what we want within seconds, and I worry that this shriveled attention span affects real-life relationships. If we discard an online article after a few glances, why not discard a new person after a brief conversation?
Now I’m no doctor—which are words you should always fear—but some prescriptions for the skimming condition seem pretty clear. Most generally, try an attitude shift. Before opening a link, consider whether you are willing to commit the amount of time necessary to truly engage with that content. Stop F-shaped reading.
For the video lover: Never, under any circumstances, skip ahead on the red bar. Pick a video that you’ll watch from start to finish, or don’t pick a video at all.
For the article lover: Read every word of every article that you pull up. If you open up 31 tabs, you better find a comfortable place to spend a few hours.
The Internet has infinite interesting material to offer, but unless you approach websites with mindful resolve, you’ll risk skimming through important information and, potentially, skimming through your life.
Don’t do it for the Vine; do it for yourself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On January 3, Boko Haram militants in north-eastern Nigeria killed thousands of civilians in the village of Baga. Yet the Western media paid scant attention to the massacre, focusing on a different terror crisis unfolding in Paris. Starting on Wednesday, January 7 at the offices of satire magazine Charlie Hebdo, France experienced three days of violent terrorist attacks. The bloodshed in Paris captured much of the world's attention, with 1.6 million people, including more than 40 world leaders, attending marches. While this attention was merited, the comparative lack of attention given the attacks in Nigeria is deplorable.
In and of itself, the world's response to the Charlie Hebdo attacks is laudable. As an attack on a symbol of the freedom of press, the terror attacks in Paris deserved such attention, and the global outpouring of solidarity with the people of Paris was nothing short of historic. We all should stand firm in the value that newspapers and ordinary citizens should be able to publish their thoughts without fear of violent retribution.
But even as nations as disparate as Israel, Palestine, and Mali came together in solidarity against terrorism in Paris, terrorism in Nigeria went largely ignored. The attacks in Nigeria amounted to several days of unremittant terror in several communties. In the town of Baga alone, Boko Haram killed an estimated 2,000 civilians,  with that number calculated after defense groups had given up counting the bodies. Amnesty International identified this attack as Boko Haram’s deadliest massacre.
In the immediate aftermath of  the Charlie Hebdo killings, the media paid little attention to the historically horrific events in Nigeria. Even the Nigerian media largely ignored the massacre in Baga. As media analyst Ethan Zuckerman pointed out, this apathy extended to the country’s political leaders: Nigerian President Goodluck E. A. Jonathan expressed sympathies to the French, but for many days remained silent on the events in Baga.
This discrepancy in attention should disturb us not only because of the human suffering largely gone unnoticed, but also because of the ideology behind Boko Haram's terror. At the root of the organization’s beliefs is the nefarious idea that Islam forbids practices deemed by them to be Western, including voting, fashion, and secular education. In truth, these values are neither opposed to Islam, nor exclusively Western. Yet Boko Haram attempts to distort Islam to harm Nigerian people and institutions, showing no compunction in atacking impoverished communities and schools.
Boko Haram’s attacks cut against many of the values we should most esteem: education, freedom, social opportunity, and political engagement. Whether kidnapping schoolgirls or slaughtering entire villages, Boko Haram is irredeemably opposed to the idea that communities can better themselves through education and economic progress.  They also stand as a grave obstacle to Nigeria’s upcoming elections. Dr. J. Peter Pham, director at the Atlantic Council’s Africa Center, points out the violence in Nigeria’s northeast will deter “at least 1.5 million people” from voting.
In light of the severity of both it ideology and its actions, Boko Haram warrants much greater attention, both here at Harvard and around the world. In Nigeria, communities are standing against this terrorist group in an effort to preserve the ideals that we are fortunate enough to live everyday. They deserve our support no less than the people of Paris, and we must ensure that they have it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Usually it’s safe to assume that a director who finds his comedy in erotic asphyxiation hasn’t set out to uphold those traits most noble in the human race. Perhaps that’s why Bobcat Goldthwait surprised me with a moment of soft, glimmering truth I found in his 2009 film, “World’s Greatest Dad."
Right at the end, sitting on the couch, Robin Williams’ character watches a Zombie movie marathon with the only friends he has left after forging his dead kid’s diary. These faithful allies are a hoarder neighbor in her late sixties and the soft-spoken, vegetarian teen friend of the dead son.
As the merry bunch settles in to view the lethargic undead pick at their cerebral victuals, I can’t help but smile. “They got it.”
For the first time in a long time I was seeing an unlikely band of misfits similar to the ones my own unconventional childhood had offered.
Among my nearest and dearest are a former monk who gave me his old paintbrushes when I said I liked my art class, a handyman who gifted me my wristwatch on our first meeting, and an elderly Croatian woman with homespun advice on how to keep a husband (lots of perfume; never let him see you sweat; fake your orgasm when necessary).
They are all single, all a bit morose, and all willing to take a teenie-bopper seriously when she offers her opinions on death, film, and happiness.
The downcast, the marginalized, the financially struggling, the old souls with checkered pasts. They are wonderful, these people the world doesn’t seem to regard. This article is the first in a bi-monthly column on how to love these beautiful yet undervalued members of society well. Let’s start with a few points on why you should strive to form close relationships with the marginalized people you meet:
“You will learn more from people who are not like you.”
At a school filled to the brim with self-motivated young people on the cusp of changing the world, it can—for some—be as easy as pie to make good friends. When faced with the opportunity to find besties whose lives run in parallel to yours, it can be difficult to justify reaching out to that kid hunched over his book in the dhall or to the musician on the first floor marching to the beat of his own drum. If the fit isn’t natural, why bother looking for friends outside your comfort zone?
I think it’s very dangerous to make your soirées no more than gatherings of like-minded individuals. When we surround ourselves with people who think like us, look like us, read the same books, toy with the same career paths, we lose sight of the variety this world has to offer.
As a result, our beliefs become falsely cemented simply because we have forgotten that there are reasonable people out there who disagree.
Moreover, particularly for Harvard students, our picture of the future becomes a Stepford series of landmarks (job, spouse, house, kids, boat) that I doubt anyone really finds satisfying. In the name of understanding the world around you better, strive to befriend those who live radically different lives from your own.
“People with fewer friends are more likely to be good friends.”
Those who don’t seem like totally covetous best friend material at first typically end up having the time and emotional energy to invest in being a friend, precisely because they aren’t being bombarded with invitations.
I sincerely believe that the marginalized can make for better friends than the well-adjusted in-crowd. When you don’t know how long it will be before another human really wants to enter your life, the urgency of planning that weekly meal forges a steadfast bond. Don’t be surprised if you spend several consecutive nights in your new friend’s room, drinking in the pleasure of each other’s company. This kind of friendship far surpasses the social garnishing we engage in once we feel “all set” in the friend department.
“You will make yourself aware of the fragility of your own privilege.”
Have you ever not had your life totally figured out? Did you take a semester off school, get an unexpected injury? Then you know how quickly this world is willing to boot you out.
If you haven’t had that experience yet, just wait: it will come. I don’t wish any evil upon you. But some well-educated, practical, financially stable person gets thrown one of life’s curve balls every day.
Holding fast to loved ones in their not-so-lucky chapters (or not-so-lucky lives) provides an invaluable perspective on what is constant in this world and what is not.
I’d love to go farther and say that the people you love when their chips are down are more likely to return the favor. I’m not sure if that’s true. Either way, good people is good people.
Knowing what you can rely on in this world teaches you how to build a life that won’t crumble away with life’s misfortunes, and that, in itself, is a grand security. Let’s take friendship seriously, throw ourselves unabashedly into the lives of those who need us most, and see what good it does.

Harvard will remain open Monday, when a winter storm may cover Boston with as much as a foot of snow, but administrators plan to monitor weather reports overnight in anticipation.
According to emails sent Sunday to Faculty of Arts and Sciences affiliates by Dean for Administration and Finance Leslie A. Kirwan ’79, FAS will hold classes on Monday and communicate any updates or alerts by 6:15 a.m. that morning.
A winter storm warning for Massachusetts went into effect on Sunday at 9 p.m. and will last until 1 a.m. Tuesday. Boston Public Schools will close Monday because of the weather, according to a statement from Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh, who declared a snow emergency for the city to go in effect Monday; cars parked on major Boston roads after 8 a.m. will be towed. A parking ban for Cambridge will go into effect at 5 a.m. Monday.
The University suspended operations less than a week ago for a blizzard—nicknamed "Juno"—that dumped about two feet of snow on campus. The storm, which prompted Massachusetts Governor Charles D. Baker ’79 to declare a state of emergency, interrupted undergraduate course shopping week.
Historically, Harvard has closed for just a few major weather events, including the blizzard of 1978, 2012’s Hurricane Sandy, and 2013’s winter storm “Nemo.” In 1977, former Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III joked that, “Harvard University will close only for an act of God, such as the end of the world.”

Rent prices of nearly 3,000 University-owned apartments will increase 2 percent on average in 2015-2016, according to a press release, marking a lower percent increase than in recent years, but still continuing a decades-long trend of increasing housing prices in Boston and Cambridge.
Harvard University Housing updates its prices every year based on an analysis of property listings around the Boston and Cambridge area to offer prices comparable to off-campus housing options. Graduate students and other Harvard affiliates occupy University Housing apartments.
The rent for University Housing listings, which includes utilities for most apartments, on average increased 5 percent, 6 percent, 5.5 percent, and 1 percent in 2014-2015, 2013-2014, 2012-2013, and 2011-2012, respectively.

Political theorist Danielle S. Allen has been appointed the next director of Harvard’s Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics beginning in July, succeeding Lawrence Lessig.
According to its website, the Edmond J. Safra Center “seeks to advance teaching and research on ethical issues in public life.” Allen will also become a professor in the Government department when she comes to Harvard.
Allen, who currently serves as the UPS Foundation Professor in the School of Social Science at the Institute for Advanced Study, has published on democratic theory, political sociology, and the history of political thought. Lessig will remain a professor at Harvard Law School.
Allen, who said she looks forward to joining the center, said she plans to focus on the themes of diversity, justice, and democracy during her first year there. She said she expects faculty to propose other themes as the center moves forward after her first year.
“The faculty, affiliates, and associates are fantastic. That’s one of the true attractions of the center,” she said.
Already, Allen has started to shape the center’s direction. She played a role in designing next year’s fellowship program at the center, which she said received more than 200 applications by the deadline last Friday.
Although Allen said it was too early to know which courses she will teach in the Government department, she said it will be a mix of undergraduate and graduate courses. She also said she may teach a lighter course load during her first year working as the center’s director.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 3, 2015, at 5:55 a.m.
Entrepreneurs, political scientists, lawyers, and students from Harvard and around the United States came together this weekend for the Kennedy School of Government’s #Hack4Congress, a “not-just-for-technologists” event that aimed to brainstorm solutions to what an organizer called congressional "dysfunction."
The hackathon, which drew about 145 attendees, was organized by the Kennedy School’s Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation in collaboration with the OpenGov Foundation.
“[We] put together this hackathon based on the realization that a lot of the innovation and technology organizations today are...looking for ways to replace, [not improve], government,” said Maggie L. McKinley, one of the event’s organizers and a lecturer at the Law School. “We were hopeful that this event could remedy...not only the dysfunction in Congress but also the absence of innovative solutions.”
At a kick-off panel on Friday afternoon, faculty and former public officials highlighted potential issues for attendees to explore, such as redistricting, lack of primary voter turnout, and the decrease in the number of candidates running for public office.
On Saturday, attendees were then divided into 13 teams that tackled topics raised during the introductory panel, as well as problems submitted beforehand by members of Congress and staffers.
The solutions brainstormed and presented over the weekend drew largely from data science and the political experience of attendees.
Tufts undergraduate Alice R. Lee said that her team looked at how to filter and analyze the massive quantity of emails received by congressional offices, a problem her teammates had encountered on Capitol Hill. Her team manually tagged some of the 250,000 emails released by Jeb Bush earlier this year from his time as governor of Florida and fed them to a prototype machine learning and language processing algorithm that they demoed at the event.
A team that included three Kennedy School students was ultimately judged the overall winner of the hackathon for their demo of a platform that would allow constituents to directly request meetings with congressional representatives, as well as view educational videos to prepare for those meetings. They will present their idea to a currently undetermined group of members of Congress and will be joined by the winners of the second #Hack4Congress event in D.C. this spring, also organized by the OpenGov Foundation.
Seamus B. Kraft, executive director and co-founder of the OpenGov Foundation and a former Congressional staffer, said that although he did not necessarily expect “silver-bullet solutions” from this event or the ones to follow, these hackathons would start the process needed to publicize and ultimately solve Congress’s problems.
“You surface problems to communities who can solve them, who have no idea that these problems exist in the first place, but who are mad as heck with Congress and their government and don’t want to take it anymore,” he said. “We can take that energy and channel it into building a better government, line by line, code by code, zero by one.”

Following an interruption of course shopping by a blizzard last week, about 80 percent of undergraduates turned in their course study cards by Friday’s deadline, according to Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Michael P. Burke.
Although administrators did not extend the study card deadline after the University closed for blizzard “Juno” last Tuesday, they said students, if necessary, could submit their registration materials until this coming Wednesday evening without a late fee.
Based on preliminary course enrollment data compiled from those study cards and published on the Registrar’s website, Harvard’s flagship introductory economics course has enrolled the largest number of undergraduates this semester.
As of Sunday, 535 students—531 of whom are undergraduates—were enrolled in the class, Economics 10b: “Principles of Economics,” taught by professor N. Gregory Mankiw. Last spring, the course ultimately enrolled 658 students.
Burke said the data is subject to change as the remaining 20 percent of students continue to submit their study cards. As students change their course schedules before the end of add/drop period, the Registrar’s Office will update the course enrollment statistics to reflect the movement.
From the preliminary data, Life Sciences 1b: “An Integrated Introduction to the Life Sciences” is the second-largest FAS course this semester, with 426 students enrolled as of Sunday, followed by Statistics 104: “Introduction to Quantitative Methods for Economics” with 320 students.
Computer Science 51: “Introduction to Computer Science II” is fourth-largest, with 305 students enrolled so far, compared to 259 students who took the course last spring.
“I’m excited that so many students are interested in the course,” said Computer Science professor Greg Morrisett, who teaches CS51 in Science Center C. “The hardest thing is finding a lecture hall… I wish we could have a bigger lecture hall and not drive people away during shopping week, just because there’s no seat for them.”
Morrisett attributes the course’s growth to the popularity of Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I.”
“A lot of students had a good time [in CS50] and want to continue on doing CS,” Morrisett said. “I think that’s the primary reason [for the large enrollment numbers].”
Until the final course enrollment numbers are logged, classroom arrangements may fluctuate, according to Burke, who said administrators were “concerned that we wouldn’t get enough [study cards] to proceed with things like classroom assignments.” He called the number of students who submitted their cards on time “pretty decent.”
Teaching fellows also depend on final study card tallies to finalize their plans for each semester, according to graduate student Cristina V. Groeger ’08, a member of the Harvard Teaching Campaign who has served as a History department teaching fellow.
“Nothing’s really set until study card day, and typically when study cards are finally submitted you know how many [students will be in a course],” she said, adding in a follow up email that she expected that the delay in some students submitting their cards would “introduce more uncertainty.”
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris could not be reached for comment.

At the first Undergraduate Council meeting of the year on Sunday, representatives discussed creating a comprehensive timeline for a gender solidarity campaign at Harvard and methods for populating a proposed events calendar website and smartphone application.
Council members are currently undergoing a series of steps to reach out to student organizations and administrators and launch the campaign to the general student body. The campaign, called Harvard HeForShe, will be an extension of an United Nations gender equality movement that began last September.
Specifically, the Council is seeking to consolidate efforts of gender groups and organizations by asking for specific campus commitments from those organizations that could be promoted by the campaign.
“By the end of February, we hope to have a more specific campus commitment plan and consolidate all the input from other organizations,” said Michelle S. Lee ’16, a Mather House representative and project manager of the Harvard HeForShe campaign. “[We also] want to include those people who usually wouldn’t be involved in the conversation. This includes males and other underrepresented groups.”
Lee is an inactive Crimson news editor.
In the week following, the UC plans to gather input from administrators during meetings with Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and University President Drew G. Faust, preparing to launch the campaign during Women’s Week in early March via a forum at the Institute of Politics.
“This could be one of the most defining things the UC has ever done,” UC Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 said at Sunday’s meeting. He and new UC President Ava Nasrollazadeh ’16 said in an interview Wednesday that this campaign was one of two main priorities for the duo this semester.
The Council also discussed the details of implementing a new Harvard calendar website and smartphone application, the other priority of the new UC leadership. UC Finance Committee Chair Leah C. Singer ’16 said her committee will require events funded by UC grant money to post their events to the newly proposed calendar. Representatives expressed hope that this requirement would help populate the calendar.
“It’s actually an accountability structure as well as an outreach technique,” Singer said. Currently, student groups that receive UC grant money for an event must make that event open to the public.
However, the UC’s most immediate efforts are concentrated toward midterm elections. Representatives urged one another to encourage women, students of color, and LGBTQ students to run in the elections.
“We want to make the Council much more representative of Harvard’s diverse student body,” UC Treasurer Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16 said.
Elections will open on Feb. 10 and close on Feb. 13, with open seats in Adams, Dunster, Leverett, Lowell, Kirkland, and Pforzheimer Houses.

Upcoming renovations to the Smith Campus Center include a redesigned and glass-paneled exterior, a rooftop terrace, and more entertainment venues, including a bar for Harvard affiliates on the building's 10th floor.
New details on the planned construction of the campus center, which is set to be completed in 2018, emerged last Friday as University planners hosted the first widespread unveiling of the building’s floor plans and initial artistic renderings. For the most part, the exhibition confirmed preliminary designs for the campus center’s first, second, and 10th floors that The Crimson first detailed last month.
Tanya Iatridis, the senior director of University planning who oversees the campus center project, reiterated the central focus areas of the Smith Center in a tour of the designs, deconstructing the plans into six areas: the welcome area, common and meeting spaces, food retail, and arts and wellness venues.
Iatridis said the building’s front facade, where the Au Bon Pain restaurant currently resides, will undergo a significant transformation.
“We are pretty much demolishing all the interior walls and…we’re moving the building outwards,” Iatridis said. The end product, depicted in artistic renderings, will feature an expanded front area with large, two-storied glass panels. The space that currently houses Clover Food Lab on Holyoke Street is also part of the to-be redesigned exterior.
Brigid O'Rourke, a Harvard spokesperson, said the fate of restaurants in the campus center has yet to be decided.
Landscapers will bring seasonal greenery into a variety of spaces across the building’s floors and walls, Iatridis said. Architects intend to transform the rooftop, which currently houses machinery, into a terrace, according to Iatridis. Elsewhere, a vitrine will encase trees in glass, and green walls will showcase various seasonal plants.
“Light and landscape have been the two big things,” Iatridis said of the renovations.
The exhibition also provided more detail on the intended uses for the space. The 10th floor will be accessible only to University affiliates and feature a bar, kitchen, pool and ping pong tables, and smaller seminar rooms, she added.
Lockers on the second floor, meanwhile, will be introduced for undergraduate and graduate students to temporarily store their belongings. That area, like other portions of the second floor, will be restricted from public access, Iatridis said.
A second, smaller set of cosmetic renovations to the entire building is also underway, as planners are identifying portions of the outer concrete that will be cleaned and windows that will need repair, according to the campus center exhibition.
The Cambridge Historical Commission and Cambridge Board of Zoning Appeal, as well as the Harvard Square Advisory Committee, will have to approve the renovation designs, meaning that they are subject to change.

Students huddled around TVs and projectors across campus Sunday night to snack on free wings and watch the New England Patriots beat the Seattle Seahawks 28-24 in the nail-biting Super Bowl XLIX, after enjoying a special Super Bowl-themed dinner menu in the dining halls.
Many House Committees threw viewing parties for students in their respective dining halls and common rooms, complete with food, kegs for those over 21, and festive decorations.
In the Winthrop House Junior Common Room, HoCo members had spread tablecloths and released balloons—in both Patriots’ blue and Seahawks’ lime-green. Around 30 students came to watch the game.
According to Matthew T. Disorbo ’17, Winthrop HoCo social chair, HoCo had consciously made an effort not to support a team, even ordering a “team-neutral cake.” Disorbo said the cake was accidentally made with “Go Pats” written on it, and HoCo had to fix it by icing it out.
In addition to the House parties, several other organizations on campus hosted their own viewing parties. The Freshman Dean’s Office and the Undergraduate Council again partnered to host a viewing party at the Queen’s Head Pub for freshmen.
The Humanist Hub at Harvard hosted a dual Super Bowl and anti-Super Bowl party open to students and Cambridge residents.
According to Vanessa M. Zoltan, assistant humanist chaplain at Harvard and a proctor in Thayer Hall, the party came about because of disagreement about the value of football among the members of the Hub.
“We wanted to throw a party where the dialogue and debate about whether football is a good thing was at the center,” Zoltan said. At one point in the party, one TV at the Hub showed the Super Bowl while another showed “Puppy Bowl,” a show on Animal Planet.
Even Harvard University Dining Services got into the celebratory spirit of the game, preparing popular finger and pub foods like potato skins and buffalo wings. According to HUDS worker Betty Johnson, the dining halls have had a special Super Bowl Sunday dinner menu for all of the 13 years she has worked at HUDS.
On Sunday, students and Harvard staff could be seen donning the jerseys of their favored teams.
Disorbo said he thought viewing parties were overall a great opportunity to get to know other students.
“It’s really cool,” said Disorbo, himself wearing a Patriots jersey. “People come out of the woodwork that you didn’t know are fans. It’s kind of a cool way to bond over something that you normally wouldn’t get to.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Personal, meet, school, Ivy League—it doesn’t matter what type of record it is.
The Harvard men’s and women’s track and field teams have not been able to stop setting them this year, and that script was no different at the Terrier Invitational at Boston University this weekend. The teams have built upon each week with one record-breaking performance after another.
“One person performing really well in one event can spur another person to exceed their personal best in a completely different event,” captain Erika Veidis said. “I think that all the records falling creates this momentum for the team to keep on performing at a high level.”
Jade Miller’s school record performance in the 500-meter race highlighted the meet, as the sophomore clocked in at 1:12.71 to break her own record en route to a second place, and top collegiate, finish.
In addition to Miller’s feat, the women set various personal records. Danielle Barbian improved in the 200 meters, as the senior set a personal time of 24.38, placing her third in Harvard history and 10th in the Ancient Eight.
Barbian was joined by classmate Ashley Collinsworth and junior Christi Scott, as their 24.50 and 24.70 marks, respectively, were good for fourth and fifth all time in Crimson history.
In the 60-meter dash, Collinsworth came away victorious with a 7.61 finish, while sophomore Jackie Modesett took home second place in the 60 meter hurdles with an 8.74 second race. Modesett was the top collegiate finisher.
The male sprinters performed solidly as well, as freshman Malcolm Johnson continued his fruitful rookie campaign with a 21.62 finish, good for second place in Harvard history. Classmates Matthew Hurst and Andrew Moore broke into the record books as well, with times of 21.74 and 22.11, for fourth and 10th on the all-time list.
Billy Looney would notch a career best 1:05.83 in the 500-meter race and would lead the way in the 800 with a 1:52.64 finish. Thomas Negron and Daniel Alpert joined Looney in the 800 with personal records of 1:55.15 and 1:55.47, respectively.
Crimson coach Jason Saretsky considers the number of records this season a testament to the strength of the program.
“Harvard has an incredibly rich tradition of success in track and field,” Saretsky said. “We’re literally re-writing the record books, and this meet was very much more of the same.”
The distance runners ended up having a particularly successful meet, as personal records fell across the board.
On the women’s side, senior Whitney Thornburg achieved a personal best in the 5,000-meter race with a time of 16:37.73 and fifth-place finish in the school record books. She would be joined by freshman Courtney Smith, whose 16:51.49 performance placed her ninth all-time.
Thomas Purnell paced the men with the Crimson’s fourth-best all-time finish in the mile as the junior clocked in at 4:02.75. He was joined by teammates Connor Reck and Jonas Aranda, who set personal bests with times of 4:05.60 and 4:06.86, good for ninth and 10th in the record books.
In the longest events of the days, Dan Milechman finished the 3,000-meter race with a time of 8:10.88, more than seven seconds faster than his previous record. Senior Will Geiken finished the 5,000-meter race with a personal best 14:16.99.
Geiken’s time was well earned, as the senior lost his shoe in the race but continued to push to finish in seventh place.
In the 800, senior Gabrielle Scott and Kieran Gallagher set personal bests with 2:11.02 and 2:11.28 finishes respectively. The story of the event, however, was Veidis.
The captain won the race with a 2:05.80 finish, just .04 seconds faster than her competitors. The performance, on the second team All-American’s first outing, was the nation’s second-best time so far this year.
While other college runners will have plenty of opportunities to crack Veidis’s mark, the Sparta, N.J., native believes there is still plenty of room for improvement.
“I’m so much stronger than I was last year,” Veidis said. “I’m pretty excited about the meets ahead, and I hope to drop the time significantly and perform better at Nationals, when I hopefully qualify.”
While the team has re-written the record books so far this year, Saretsky believes that the squad will have to continue to work in order to be successful against conference rivals.
“The team looks good, but so does the whole league,” Saretsky said. “The Ivy League track and field is really at an all-time high level…. It’s mind blowing just how competitive the league is. We’ve got our work cut out from us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a pivotal weekend for the ECAC standings, the No. 4/4 Harvard women’s ice hockey team (15-4-2, 12-2-1 ECAC) split its decisions against No. 5/5 Quinnipiac (20-4-3, 11-2-2) and Princeton (11-10-2, 9-6-1), keeping the team second in the conference with six regular season games left on the schedule.
PRINCETON 1, HARVARD 0
Despite a third period rally from the Crimson, a first period goal by the Tigers was all Princeton’s offense would need to seal the deal against a stingy Harvard defense.
The only tally of the afternoon came off the stick of Tiger forward Molly Contini at the 8:20 mark of the opening period. Taking advantage of a steal by Princeton sophomore Hilary Lloyd, the Tigers shoveled the puck to sophomore defenseman Kelsey Koelzer and eventually on to Contini, who lifted the puck past Crimson goaltender Brianna Laing for her 14th goal of the season.
“Every game in this conference matters, and it was definitely a disappointing loss for us, but it just goes to prove that anyone can beat anyone in this league,” freshman forward Dani Krzyszczyk said.“We all know what we are capable of which makes the loss a little more disappointing.”
For the rest of the night, the rink was silent on both ends. Over the first two periods, Harvard tallied just  15 shots on the Princeton goal, with sophomore forward Sydney Daniels and senior defenseman Josephine Pucci leading the Crimson with three apiece.
But in the third period, Harvard made its last push to tie the game, recording 17 shots in the final 20 minutes, compared to Princeton’s five. Tiger goaltender Kimberly Newell snuffed the Crimson’s last effort at salvaging the game, blocking senior forward Kalley Armstrong’s shot with seconds left in the contest.
With the loss, the Crimson fell back into second place in the ECAC, a point behind Quinnipiac in the conference standings.
“Being at the top of the standings means that every team we play is going to give us their best,” senior forward Lyndsey Fry said. “We just need to continue to give them our best. But we had our opportunities tonight. We just need to put them away.”
HARVARD 2, QUINNIPIAC 1
In a matchup between the top two teams in the ECAC, the regularly scheduled 60 minutes of play were not enough to determine the superiority of either the Crimson or the Bobcats. That question was not answered until 3:26 into the overtime period.
The winning goal for Harvard came off the stick of Daniels following a pass series by Fry and classmate Sarah Edney as they worked their way up the ice. Handling the puck in Quinnipiac territory, Edney fired a pass to Daniels, who redirected the puck into the back of the net, past Bobcat goaltender Chelsea Laden. The goal was Daniels’ 12th of the season.
“It was an amazing feeling when the puck went in,” Krzyszczyk said. “Our entire team was so excited, we jumped off the bench and came into the dressing room screaming. It was definitely a huge game, and we knew what was on the line, so it was great to see us come back and get the win.”
For the first 60 minutes of play, the two teams were neck and neck. The first tally of the contest did not come until 2:36 into the second period, as Bobcat forward Nicole Kosta put a backhanded shot beyond the reach of Crimson goalie Emerance Maschmeyer.  Harvard answered later in the period with a goal coming from the stick of Armstrong after Daniels fed a pass to the senior deep in Quinnipiac territory.
The Bobcats outshot the Crimson in each of the three regulation periods, logging a total of 27 attempts, compared to Harvard’s 18. It was not until the overtime period that the Crimson gained an edge in shots, recording three against Quinnipiac’s lone attempt.
In goal for the Crimson, Maschmeyer continued her winning ways, improving her record to 8-3-2 with a overall save percentage of .929. The junior finished the contest with 26 saves.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though the Harvard women’s basketball team may have been on the losing end of a back and forth contest against Penn (11-6, 2-1 Ivy) Saturday evening at Lavietes Pavilion, the game was one for the record books.
As the first half came to a close, senior forward Temi Fagbenle sunk a free throw to become the 19th player in Crimson history to score 1,000 points. Fagbenle was Harvard’s leading scorer in the game, earning 19 points to bring her career total to 1,010.
“We actually had no idea that she was going for her 1,000th point,” junior forward AnnMarie Healy said. “It wasn’t until halftime that [one of] our assistants let us know that she had scored her 1,000th point. It was just sad we couldn’t get the win for her.”
Along with earning her 1,000th point, Fagbenle also earned her eighth double-double of the season, leading the team with 11 rebounds. Through 18 games, Fagbenle is averaging a double-double for the year with 14.5 points and 10.4 boards per game.
But it wasn’t enough for the Crimson (8-10, 1-3), who fell to the Quakers by a score of 74-69. Despite several major runs by Penn, the Crimson consistently battled back, creating nine lead changes over the course of the game.
With one minute left on the clock, Harvard trailed by a score of 65-54, but the Crimson kept fighting. Harvard scored 15 points in the final 42 seconds of play, getting as close as within four points. But the Crimson could not produce a 10th lead change, as the Quakers scored eight points in the same period of time to hang onto their lead as the clock wound to zero.
“We are definitely a team that doesn’t go away,” Healy said. “With three minutes left down 10 points, a lot of teams will just give up, but we’re a team that doesn’t go away, doesn’t give up. That’s one of the reasons I’m so glad to be on this team.”
Coming off a difficult loss to No. 19/21 Princeton, Harvard got off to a strong start by scoring the first seven points of the game. The Crimson kept Penn from scoring for over three minutes, until senior forward Kara Bonenberger sunk a layup to get the Quakers on the board.
Despite Harvard's early lead, two quick threes followed to bring the Quakers within one. The Crimson would end the half with a slim lead, heading into the break holding a 33-30 edge.
At the start of the second half, it took nearly four minutes for either team to put the ball in the net, but once they broke the ice, the two teams went shot for shot.
But once the clock wound down to 8:50 left in the second half, Penn began to break away, starting with a layup by freshman forward Michelle Nwokedi. A trio of three-pointers would stretch the lead to 10, though it would eventually grow as big as 14 with less than two minutes remaining.
Three pointers played a major role for both teams throughout the game. Each side recorded 27 points from beyond the arc, with Harvard making 9-of-15 treys and the Quakers sinking 9-of-20. Co-captain Erin McDonnell and senior guard Ali Curtis each hit three, while junior guard Shilpa Tummala added another two from deep.
The Crimson faces its next Ancient Eight opponents this upcoming weekend when the team plays Brown and Yale at home. These will be the last two home games before Harvard heads on the road for four consecutive Ivy League contests.
“There’s still a whole lot of games to go, so we still have to keep trucking, stay strong, and you know, [not] waver from our goals as a team,” Fagbenle said. “We can’t let these losses get us down.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, it took the Harvard men’s volleyball team only two hours and six sets to dispatch Emmanuel and Alderson Broaddus in nonconference action at the Malkin Athletic Center.
In both matches, the No. 15 Crimson (3-3) posted high kill percentages en route to straight-set victories.
“We did the little things pretty well,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “This weekend, we defended well…and we’re making good decisions on offense. We’re not making a lot of unforced errors.”
HARVARD 3, ALDERSON BROADDUS 0
With Harvard holding a 24-21 lead in the second set, the visiting Battlers (2-1) were doing something they had done frequently over the last 40 minutes: scrambling.
A mishandled pass sent blue-and-yellow players racing off the court, but hustling proved futile, as a desperation punch collided with the rafters and ended the set.
On a day of desperate sprinting, the Battlers could not outrun defeat, falling 3-0 to the Crimson in just over an hour.
Offensive efficiency propelled Harvard to victory, with the hosts recording a .383 hitting percentage. Alderson Broaddus finished with a .023 mark.
“It starts with our passing,” co-captain Caleb Zimmick said. “Both setters are working really well…[but] our serving can probably be a little bit better and tougher.”
Strong attacking was on display in the first frame, when the Crimson opened play on a 20-7 tear that included two 5-0 runs. The hosts racked up 13 first-set kills and just one error en route to a 25-13 win.
The Battlers showed signs of life in the third set, playing Harvard to a 6-6 deadlock. However, over the next seven points, Alderson Broaddus committed six attack errors and ultimately handed the set to the Crimson, 25-17.
Sophomore outside hitter Casey White and Zimmick led Harvard in kills with nine and eight, respectively. From the setter position, sophomore Nick Bendell managed the attack and collected 28 assists.
“Coach really emphasized treating ever match like it’s [No. 1] Loyola,” White said. “We’re trying to keep that intensity throughout everything.”
HARVARD 3, EMMANUEL 0
On Friday night, the Crimson used a pair of late-set runs to transform a couple of close games against the Saints into a blowout performance. Helped by critical errors by Emmanuel (0-1), Harvard earned a 3-0 victory at the Malkin Athletic Center.
Junior outside hitter Branden Clemens topped the Crimson with nine kills, and White was right behind with eight. However, the defense may have been the most productive form of offense, as the squad won 11 points with blocks.
“We’ve been working really hard in practice on our blocks,” White said. “Last year, we were not that great blocking-wise…so this year, we came in wanting to block better.”
Despite winning the first seven points of the third set, Harvard watched the Saints claw back to 14-13. However, the Crimson responded with its strongest stretch of the day, an 11-1 streak that culminated in three consecutive errors by Emmanuel.
The same narrative concluded Harvard’s second set. After reaching a 19-19 tie, the Crimson closed out the game with a 6-2 run that included four attacking errors by the Saints and two kills by Clemens.
Throughout the match, Harvard’s greatest foe was itself—or, more specifically, its own serving difficulties. Against Emmanuel, the team averaged nearly five service errors per set.
“Part of that is we’re really trying to be more aggressive,” Baise said. “With that comes some errors…. Part of it is confidence, just getting into a groove.”
But as soon as a rally began, the Crimson attack was hard to stop, as evidenced by .342 kill percentage. In the first set, which Harvard took, 25-16, the hosts played the last 20 points without an error.
By contrast, the Saints finished the game with a negative hitting efficiency.
“We’re hoping to compete at the top,” Zimmick said. “We’ve had some good wins, and I’m really excited with where we’re at and where we can go.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the weekend Blodgett Pool was transformed into the hub of Ivy League rivalry, as the top three swim programs in the Ancient Eight met to settle the argument of which team reigns supreme.
The Harvard women’s swimming and diving team (7-1-1, 6-0-1 Ivy) faced off against Princeton (6-2-1, 5-0-1) and Yale (6-2, 4-2), as the Crimson looked to continue its four-year streak of sweeping the meet. The results were mixed, as the team came out on Saturday with a 184-116 win against Yale and a 150-150 tie with Princeton.
“It was incredibly excited going into this meet. I love HYP - you can rarely get the energy and the level of competition at any other meet,” senior diver Schuyler Moore said. “There is always pressure to win this meet, but at the end of the day we have a bigger goal. We want to be Ivy League champions, and this meet is just another practice round for that goal.”
On Friday, Harvard dominated the first few events, starting with the 200 medley relay. Junior Danielle Lee, senior Stephanie Ferrell, and sophomores Daniela Johnson and Victoria Chan had a combined time of 1:42.38 to win the event for the Crimson by more than a body length ahead of their nearest competitors. Tigers Shirley Wang, Olivia Chan, Elsa Welshofer, and Maddy Veith, came in two seconds later. Yale’s team and Harvard’s B team came in fractions of a second after Princeton.
The Crimson continued to show its dominance in events three, four, and five. Junior Margaret Ramsey won the 200 free with a time of 1:49.56. Lee and freshman Kristina Li nabbed the top two spots in the 100 back, and Ferrell outpaced Yale’s Paulina Kaminski and Princeton’s Chan in the 100 breast.
At that point, the Crimson was up by over 20 points against both the Tigers and the Bulldogs.
From there, the momentum shifted in Princeton’s favor, with the Tigers taking four of the top five spots in the 50 free.
In diving, freshmen Jing Jeung and Hannah Allchurch came in 2nd and 3rd place in the 3-meter dive with scores of 314.40 and 305.85, respectively. Both finished behind Princeton’s Caitlin Chambers, who scored a 330 in the event.
On Saturday, Princeton’s momentum continued with a win in the 100 free, but Harvard quickly came back in the next event, the 200 backstroke. Lee, Li and sophomore Marissa Cominelli helped shorten the Tigers’ lead by sweeping the event.
Freshman Katie Evans won the 200 breaststroke event and Ferrell took third, putting Harvard in the lead, 13 points in front of Princeton. Junior Sherry Liu and Ramsey finished 1-2 in the 500 free.
“The energy from hearing teammates and fans cheering is absolutely contagious,” junior Shori Hijikata said. “There's nothing quite like swimming the last 50 of a 200 butterfly and seeing a crowd of faces cheering for you on the last turn; it makes you forget about how much your body is hurting and reminds you that you're racing for the team.”
Yale and Princeton came back, shutting out Harvard in the 100 fly and taking top spots in the 1-meter dive. Freshman Geordie Enoch put Harvard back into action with a win in the 200 IM, but the fate of the meet came down to the last event—the 400 free relay.
“The swimmers were giving 110% in every race, and I'm incredibly impressed with how hard everyone fought on both days,” Moore said. “On the diving side, we all had some fantastic dives and we all had areas where we can improve.”
Lee, Johnson, freshman Gabby Sims and junior Kendall Crawford touched the wall just .21 seconds behind Princeton. Taking second place in the event gave Harvard the tie against Princeton.
Harvard also recognized its six seniors—Ferrell, Moore, Cassie Corneau, Kelsey Hojan-Clark, Faith Martin, and Sarah Sumner—for their contributions to the team in the Senior Day ceremony that was held before the meet on Saturday.
“As a team, I think today was the epitome of coming together and fighting under pressure,” Hijikata said.

The Harvard skiing team continues to turn in solid performances, as the team notched yet another top-10 performance at the St. Michael’s carnival in Huntington, Vermont. The team finished with 272 points, just nine points behind the hosts.
The team was led by senior Akeo Mailfeld-Carucci, who finished in ninth place in the 10k classic race with a time of 32:27.8. It marked the third time in three race in which the Bozeman, MT native has finished inside the top 10.
Rookie Connor Green finished the 10k race in 42nd with a time of 34:42.0 as the freshman obtained 12 points for the squad.
The Nordic team continued its success, as sophomore Rachel Hampton finished the 5k race with a time of 18:25.0, good for 13th place overall and the third straight top-20 finish for the sophomore.
Hampton was joined by classmate Maile Sapp who placed 32nd with a time of 19:13.9. Juniors Hanna Barnes and Annie Harvieux came close behind the sophomore duo, finishing in 35th and 36th.
In the team events, Sapp, Maifeld- Carruci, Hampton and sophomore Devlin Shea teamed up to take 13th place overall in the 4x3 freestlye relay, finishing with a time of 40:18.2. The squad was closely followed by the team of Green, Barnes, Harvieux and sophomore Ian Meyer, who turned in a 19th place, 41:12.6 finish.
The Nordic squad would ultimately finish with 180 of the team’s 272 points, finishing no lower than ninth place in the individual events.
While they contributed the majority of the points, the Noridc team wouldn’t be the only ones who would prove to be successful, as the alpine team helped contribute with solid performances of their own.
Freshman Kelly Steeves would lead the team with 25th and 31st place finishes in the giant slalom and slalom, respectively. It was the second straight weekend that the rookie finished first for the Crimson in both events. Junior Samantha Udolf joined Steeves in the slalom with a 34th place, 2:01.15 finish
On the men’s side, junior Simon Merryweather would finish 30th in the slalom with a  1:53.66 mark and was followed closely by teammates Dan Rittenhouse and James Stevenson, as the junior and sophomore finished in 36th and 37th respectively.
The skiing team continues its season next weekend as the team travels to Hanover, NH to compete at the Dartmouth Carnival hosted by perennial national powerhouse Darmouth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hockey East officials announced on Sunday that the first round games of the 63rd Annual Beanpot will be played on Tuesday due to the winter storm forecasted for the Boston area Sunday night into Monday.
The No. 4/4 Harvard men’s hockey team will open the tournament at 5 p.m. at TD Garden against No. 2/2 Boston University. Northeastern and No. 14/15 Boston College will play at 8 p.m. The games were originally scheduled for the same times on Monday.
The postponement could help Harvard, which is trying to get key players back from injury. In addition to star defenseman Patrick McNally, who is out for the rest of the regular season, Harvard was without the services of sophomore forwards Alex Kerfoot, Sean Malone, and Luke Esposito and other key players during Friday’s home game against Union.
Kerfoot and Malone are back on the ice but skating non-contact, according to Assistant Director of Athletics Communications Brock Malone on Sunday. Kerfoot has been out since Nov. 29, while Malone has not played since Dec. 30. The two NHL draft picks have yet to play together in a game this season.

The 49th Super Bowl is about ready to kick off. Maybe you’re too busy studying for next month’s midterm or trying to figure out your schedule for next year (if so, take a step back). Otherwise, odds are you at least got invited to a study break watch party, or are amped to see if this year’s commercials can top this fantastic list, or maybe you’re psyched to see Frozen’s Princess Elsa sing the National Anthem, hoping that John Travolta will be announcing her name. Regardless of why you’re watching the game, there’s always a chance your crush will be there watching with you, in which case you want to know your ish. So, step by step, inch by inch, read this post to learn a little something about football and what teams are actually playing.
THE BASICS
1. What is football?
It’s not soccer, so enough jokes from all you Brits, because the term “soccer” originated in England. In fact, the term “soccer” preceded the singular word “football” by about 18 years in describing the world’s most beloved game. So, jokes on you. Football is the game with a Hey Arnold head-shaped ball. There are touchdowns, field goals, and hot quarterbacks.
2. What is a “Super Bowl”
Super Bowl Sunday, for lack of a better definition, is the best day of the year. You wake up smiling, eat some chicken wings, watch some football, see who wins the ring, and hopefully smile some more, unless you’re a Pats fan circa 2007, when we went 16-0, got a little cocky, made a remix to Flo Rida’s “Low”, then lost to the Giants in the Super Bowl.
3. Who is playing?
Figured this would be a nice transition, since, once again, the New England Patriots are in the Super Bowl. They currently have three rings, but there's always room for a few more. The Pats will be playing the Seattle Seahawks, who got their first ring last year.
THE IMPORTANT STUFF
1. Tom Brady.
G.O.A.T. QB for the Pats. Married to Gisele Bundchen. Uggs Model. Objectively very sexy. Arguably one of the greatest quarterbacks ever. Call me biased (sorry, I’m from Boston), but let’s talk statistics. Today, he will be the second player in NFL history to appear in six Super Bowls. He holds the record for most playoff wins by a quarterback with 20. He holds the record for most playoff games started. He broke Joe Montana’s record for most postseason touchdown passes. What’s most impressive though? He’s one of the best football players out there, yet Gisele makes three times as much money as he does.
2. Russell Wilson
Before I get too biased, there is no way I can avoid the talent that Wilson holds as QB for the Seahawks. Not only can he throw touchdowns, but he isn’t afraid to get hit. Unlike Brady, who’s known to slide on the turf before he would ever take a chance at running, Wilson swept QB records in 2014 with 849 yards paced.
3. The Halftime Show
Get ready for some Fireworks, California Gurls, and maybe even a Roar. Katy Perry will rep the halftime show this year.
4. Who should I root for?
If you’re from Boston, New England, or go to school in Cambridge, it might get a little awkward, but who’s to judge? Basically, if you know nothing about football, go with the team with most attractive players (read: Rob Gronkowski). Or pick the best uniform. Or whoever’s winning. But, let’s be real, the winning team hosts a parade. TL;DR: If the Patriots win tonight, there will be a parade in Boston. Tom Brady will be there and so will I. It will be rowdy.

There’s no shortage of winter activities (or snow) in New England. If you’re not up for leaving the Cambridge area for skiing or snowboarding but still want to have some frosty fun, you’re in luck. Harvard Skate is back for another season, and manager Harrison Choate ’17, an inactive Blog editor, promises that this will be the biggest year yet.
“I didn’t know about Harvard Skate before coming to Harvard,” Choate told the Crimson. “It adds a lot of life to campus during the winter, especially since the activity in the Science Center Plaza tends to die down after the fall. It’s a big draw for students.”
Harvard Skate was founded in 2012 as part of the Harvard Common Spaces Initiative and is currently staffed through Harvard Student Agencies. Last year, Harvard Skate received a new rink, but this year has seen some great improvements to the space. Two wooden decks, fire pits, and curling lanes with synthetic ice are now available as part of the Harvard Skate experience.
Harvard Skate is open from 12 to 9 p.m. everyday, and lessons are offered Friday afternoons, first come first served, at 3:30 p.m. Hot chocolate and s’mores kits are available for purchase for a warm winter treat. And on Wednesday, February 4th at 12 p.m., there will be a special event featuring figure skater Christina Gao ’17. Though the snow will be here until April, don’t wait to stop by Harvard Skate!

Happy day-after-Super-Bowl-Sunday day! Hopefully your inside-out pajamas and ice flushed down the toilet convinced your professors to cancel class. Otherwise, best of luck to all the hungover Pats fans drinking to our accomplishments, and the brutal Butler-intercepted-when-we-had-two-minutes-and-were-yards-away-from-winning PTSD to all you Seahawks fans. Regardless of your allegiance, today is the best day ever because even if you are trudging through the snow to get to Math 21000, you will finally find out when the Patriots parade will be.
IN THE ATMOSPHERE
Today we’re looking at a high of 34 degrees and a low of 4 degrees, not to mention a 100% chance of snow, with 8-12 inches of snow and ice accumulating. Snowmobiles or skis are highly suggested.

On February 1, the New England Patriots defeated the Seattle Seahawks 28-24 in Super Bowl XLIX. That’s the boring version of things. Try this: THE PATS WON, CUE THE DUCKBOATS. TB12 IS THE MOST HANDSOME MAN TO EVER WALK THE EARTH. Yes, this Recap is being written by an admittedly biased Pats fan, but your team didn’t just win the Super Bowl so deal with it. Here are a few things to note:
