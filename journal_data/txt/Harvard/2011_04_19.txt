After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A young Palestinian boy in a theater with whitewashed walls pivots to the audience, barely containing a delighted grin. “If the princess brings the sun into the palace, she will be queen. So, if I bring the sun into the palace … why, then, I shall be king!” He breaks into his best-rehearsed evil laughter, a “mwa-ha-ha-ha” that leaves his eyes sparkling above his nefariously wriggling fingers. As the boy, Yousef Swetti, exits the stage, a voiceover matter-of-factly announces that he will die ten years later as a suicide bomber in Hadera. The film cuts to a clip of the video he made with his friend Nidal as the two—dressed in camouflage with the picture of a dead Palestinian girl behind them—prepare to carry out their attack.
“Arna’s Children”—shown in Sever last Monday as a memorial to its maker, Juliano Mer-Khamis, who was shot by Palestinian militants on April 4 in Jenin—is a documentary with few adornments. Though it depicts a brutal situation, it is not graphic—at least, not excessively so. The film’s power comes instead from it being relentlessly true. It spares neither the promising lives of the young children it depicts, nor their untimely, often harrowing deaths. Though the story it portrays—one of children whose lives are marked by violence and end in violence—is one ripe for philosophizing or making political points, Mer-Khamis overtly does neither. His focus is instead on the humans in the situation—his mother Arna, still picketing the Israeli occupation troops after being diagnosed with terminal cancer; the children roughhousing in the theater and art school she set up in a refugee camp in Jenin; and those children when they’ve grown up, as they plan to put a landmine at the entrance to their camp.
Juliano Mer-Khamis, an actor and filmmaker, continued his mother’s theater for Palestinian children in Jenin after her death, renaming it the Freedom Theater. Though Mer-Khamis was himself half-Israeli and half-Palestinian, he preferred to describe himself differently, saying “it’s not half-half. It’s one hundred percent-one hundred percent.” He worked on many vaunted Israeli film projects with some of the country’s best directors, even as he always returned home to his theater in the West Bank.
Allie Chen ’10, who helped organize the memorial screening, said that this openness and humanity was a perspective that informed Mer-Khamis’s art and the way in which he treated his subjects. Chen, who worked as a dance choreographer in the Freedom Theater for the better part of two summers and knew Mer-Khamis and his family personally, recounted how “his pedagogy was not to lecture or pontificate or to say what is right or wretched … he was a human being first and foremost. What matters is freedom and laughter.”
Thus, while “Arna’s Children” documents children sitting next to the ruins of their houses and the young laughter of men who grow to become suicide bombers, its intent is not so much to make a point about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as it is to cherish and celebrate the humanity of its subjects. We see, through the course of the film, countless shots of the plays that the children carefully rehearsed, and, later on, how they light up when reflecting on their acting experiences. Though the children’s deaths are a part of the documentary, they do not overwhelm it. Rather, by stating the fact of their deaths early on, Mer-Khamis manages to move beyond their violent ends, making their lives more important. He draws his audiences into the families of the children, into their houses and their vivid lives. Mer-Khamis’s art is his capacity to frame so many charged situations without becoming polemical or nihilistic, capturing reality in all its complexity.
Complexity was a word often applied to Mer-Khamis himself at the memorial. One speaker recalled how the filmmaker once comforted his daughter in Haifa over the phone after a terrorist rocket had struck nearby—while at the same time ferrying two Palestinian militants hidden in the back of his car into the West Bank.
In the wake of Mer-Khamis’s death, the work of the Freedom Theater will continue, and envelopes for donations were passed out at the memorial screening. Chen characterizes its work as “the very humble … mission … to say that ‘we cannot speak for what you go through. All we know is that you have suffered deep emotional trauma, and you may often be beset with the burden of feeling that you don’t have anything to live for.’” Encapsulating this message in film, “Arna’s Children” proves a fitting memorial to its creator and his life’s work.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A young girl is raised in the wilderness by her widowed father—with no more than an encyclopedia, a book of fairy tales, and a history of CIA training—and becomes the ideal assassin. That girl is Hanna, played by Oscar-nominated actor Saoirse Ronan in Joe Wright’s newest feature. Over the phone, with her cheerful tone and soft Irish accent, Saoirse—which means ‘freedom’ in Irish and is pronounced ‘Sear-shuh’—is anything but intimidating. With a maturity beyond her 16 years, she expresses an acute artistic sensibility and an impressively professional demeanor.
Ronan has eight years of experience under her belt, and she already has a clear sense of what she prefers for her career. “I like things that are weird,” she says. “I like strange stories, and dreamlike stories too”—an unsurprising sentiment coming from the actor who played the lead role in Peter Jackson’s ethereal adaptation of Alice Sebold’s novel “The Lovely Bones.” “I always find that if I read a script and I’m still thinking about it hours and hours later, and I start acting out the scenes—in my head, and in real life—then it’s something that I’m interested in,” she says.
For “Hanna,” part of the appeal was the stunts. “I always like to do something different,” Ronan says. “The fact that I get to do an awful lot of physical activity—I had never really done anything like that before in a movie. I’ve always been quite an athletic person, so I thought it would be fun, and it would be tough work but really good preparation, to train and learn fight choreography and things like that.”
Ronan’s working relationship with Joe Wright—who directed her Oscar-nominated performance in “Atonement”—wasn’t a factor in choosing the project, because Ronan was brought onto the film before Wright was. In fact, she suggested him to the studio. “I became involved before Joe was,” she recounts. “Focus [Features] had sent me the script, and I really liked it so I talked to John Lyons about it. They said that they didn’t have a director attached, and the first person who popped into my head was Joe, so I suggested him.”
“We have this ongoing joke now that I am getting Mr. Wright his work, and no one else will hire him,” she laughs.
The suggestion of a familiar director paid off. “Joe never really treated me like a kid even when I was 12-years-old, and he certainly didn’t when we did ‘Hanna’ together,” Ronan says. “I had definitely grown as an actor [between “Atonement” and “Hanna”], and I think he could see that. It left us with more creative freedom … We were able to try different things … He knows me, professionally, very very well, so he was like a puppeteer—he knew what strings to pull.”
“I think he’s even gotten a bit braver as a director, which is nice to say,” she continues. “We’ve both kind of grown up a bit, really, so it was nice to work with him again.”
This sense of familiarity with her crew is something that Ronan values. “I actually like the idea of working with the same people over and over again. Especially when you’re taking a risk. I’d never done an action film before, and neither had [Wright], so to go in that new direction together was great.”
But it wasn’t just the action that was a challenge for Ronan. Her character is forced to confront a number of revelations about her existence and unexpected questions about her own humanity; for this more emotional side of the role, Ronan found her own ways to prepare.
“It was quite important to basically wipe my own personal memory of anything that I’d really experienced, especially over the past few years, because Hanna never went through those things, and has never really lived a life,” she explains. “I found that really helpful to portray the innocence and the naïveté of her.”
In portraying Hanna, Ronan does not see herself as having made a permanent switch from drama to action. “I don’t really think of Hanna as an action character,” she says. “To a certain extent I do, but she’s a lot more than that.”
So what’s next for this budding star? “I’d like to go to college in a few years from now, hopefully. I’m still working, so I’d quite like to make an Irish film in Ireland—because I’ve never actually done that before—and play an Irish character. Hopefully that’ll happen soon.”
It sounds like the rising starlet is up for pretty much anything. “I don’t really have a preference,” she said. “I’d love to do a musical, I like to do action, I like doing drama, I want to do comedy—it’s all fun, and it’s all film.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A radical group with grievances against the government carries out a multifaceted attack on numerous targets, devastating the nation and bringing the United States to its knees. Sounds familiar, right? But contrary to what one would assume from that description, these events take place in 1865 and comprise the opening sequence of Robert Redford’s “The Conspirator,” a well-acted period drama that also serves as a potent contemporary allegory.
The film opens on the night of Abraham Lincoln’s assassination, an event which is intercut with simultaneous attempts on the lives of Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William Seward. Soon afterwards, the conspirators are hunted down and either captured or killed. Included in this roundup is Mary Surratt (Robin Wright), the owner of the boarding house where John Wilkes Booth and his cronies hatched their plot. Appointed to represent Surratt is Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy), a Union veteran under the tutelage of Senator Reverdy Johnson (Tom Wilkinson). Defending Surratt is not easy, however, as Secretary of War Edwin Stanton (Kevin Kline) has assembled a kangaroo court whose verdict has essentially been decided even before the first witness is sworn in.
In form, the film is consistent with most courtroom dramas, centered upon gripping testimony and interrogation, though Redford occasionally provides “Rashomon”-style flashbacks to liven up the pacing. Particularly compelling in these scenes are performances by Stephen Root as a witness for the prosecution and Colm Meaney as the leader of the military commission appointed to try Surratt.
As for the lead characters, defender McAvoy and defendant Penn both play off each other well and are believable in their roles, though Penn’s Surratt is emotionally static and seems to be the same person at the end of the film as she is at the start. The perennially underrated Wilkinson holds his own as Senator Johnson, a bastion of constitutional rights, though it is Kevin Kline who delivers the most electrifying, scenery-chewing performance as Edwin Stanton—a man with understandable motivations coupled with a deplorable method of realizing them.
The film’s central analogy to post-9/11 America is obvious. “Someone must be held accountable,” Kline’s Stanton tells McAvoy’s Aiken, “The people want that.” The debate over whether or not that national catharsis should come at the cost of abandoning the Constitution is crucial to James Solomon’s script. “It’s not justice you’re after; it’s revenge,” Aiken responds. Drawing its post-9/11 parallels still further, the film even includes a few shots of souvenir vendors clustered outside Surratt’s prison, hoping to profit off Lincoln’s death, much in the same way souvenir vendors now sell shoddy “Never Forget” t-shirts.
While the primary action of the film is its taut courtroom drama, the story is unfortunately weighed down by an unnecessary, melodramatic, and unresolved romantic subplot between Aiken and his wife Sarah (Alexis Bledel), who just simply cannot bear her husband becoming a social pariah, almost as much as we cannot bear her performance. Similarly superfluous is Justin Long’s appearance as a friend of Aiken’s, whose laughably out-of-place acting makes it seems as though Long took a wrong turn on the way to a Civil War reenactment.
Aside from these brief missteps, though, the film drips with historical authenticity; its shots are washed out just enough to look like old photographs, and details in costuming, dialogue, and props all help sell the realism of the work—that and the facial hair. And man, is there a lot of it. Fans of mile-long mutton chops and bushy neckbeards will definitely not be disappointed by this film. Indeed, if there were an Oscar for Best Facial Hair, “The Conspirator” would win hands down.
But the film has more going for it than just sideburns. Driven by strong performances, apt historical details, and weighty contemporary relevance, “The Conspirator” might not be a film that will be remembered by the year’s end, but in the lull between the cinematic graveyard of January and the summer movie season, it’s a definite standout.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The name “Brattle Street Chamber Players” is not usually brought up in conversation about Harvard’s performing arts scene. And that’s just the way the musicians like it. “[It] gives us leeway to do whatever we feel like doing,” said Lenora C. Murphy ’12, and then added with a smile, “it feels like you’re one of the cool kids.” Her colleague Jeremy Ying ’13 agrees. “It feels elite,” he said jokily, “like, haven’t you heard of Brattle?” The group’s underground feel gives their concerts a special excitement and charge, and their audiences pride themselves on discovering this rare gem. However, given the caliber of their performance, the Players may find it hard to keep their project a secret for much longer.
Last Saturday in Paine Hall, the Players presented a joint concert with their sister chamber orchestra from Columbia University, “fourbythree.” The evening’s repertoire embodied the spirit of the group—that is, an electrifying mixture of zaniness, bombast, and the finest individual musicianship that Harvard has to offer. Nowhere was this better demonstrated than the Players’ rendition of Johann Sebastian Bach’s “The Art of Fugue, BMW 1080.”
Arranged for the group by Lucien D. Werner ’13, the fugue epitomizes the Brattle Street aesthetic. According to Bobby S. Chen ’14, the arrangement was, harmonically, a real challenge—a musical progression of increasing complexity made all the more difficult by the fact that the Players are unconducted. However, listening to the musicians confront the piece, as risky as it was, was part of the fun.  The acute attention of each of the performers—and the cohesive performance that resulted—was reminiscent of a high-wire act: if any of the musicians erred, the entire ensemble would be thrown off. Though not necessarily a technically perfect performance, the Players’ performance of Bach was wholly characteristic: full of excitement and ambition.
The highlight of the evening, however, was the “Allegretto from String Quintet in C Major, D. 956” by Franz Schubert. It is a nakedly showy piece, as even the Players admitted themselves—Chen likened the piece, which the musicians played with  gusto, to the soundtrack of “Pirates of the Caribbean.” The playing was simply infectious, especially in the berserk, frantic violin sections at the piece’s beginning and end. The performance received a veritable roar of approval from the audience, and one could not help but feel the sense of intimacy Murphy described between the group extend to their small body of fans.
Also worth mentioning were the Players’ thrilling performance of “La Follia Variations for String Orchestra” by Francesco Geminiani and arranged by Michi Wiancko—complete with woodblock, tambourine, and synchronized foot-stamping—as well as the World Premiere of a student-written composition, “Then the Silence Increased,” by Zachary T. Sheets ’13. Sheets’ piece stood up surprisingly well in the masterful selection of works—perhaps because, as Murphy explained, it was written specifically for the Players and thus tailored to the musicians’ individual talents. This commissioning of original work has become an important part of the group’s remit.
At the risk of sounding pro-Harvard jingoistic, I believe Brattle’s unabashed passion and bombast may have made for a more lovable performance. However, the musicians of “fourbythree,” many who are students of the Columbia-Julliard Exchange, gave an impressively professional performance; Arnold Schoenberg’s “Transfigured Night, Op. 4” was a testament to the group’s more technically demanding musical selections. Their performance of “The Unanswered Question” by Charles Ives was powerful, combining a swirling ambient wash from a small orchestra hidden behind the stage curtain of Paine Hall with incongruous slivers of fragmented brass and woodwind. Though “fourbythree” did not exude the same sense of riotous pleasure as the Players, their musicianship is undeniable. Perhaps a performance in their home concert hall may have brought out a similar quality.
Indeed, this riotous pleasure seems to sum up the Players’ entire ethos—that music should be fun. This approach, as much as their technicality and artistry, is the source of their compelling performance. As Murphy said, “we do this because we love it.”

It is not often that one can experience an art museum during the walk to Lamont Library or biology lab. However, this spring, the Harvard Graduate School of Design (GSD) and the Harvard Art Museums have joined in a collaborative effort to produce “a project in art and the public domain” entitled “The Divine Comedy.” A trio of innovative installations, “The Divine Comedy” is not placed inside Harvard’s traditional gallery spaces, but are—for the most part—outside and highly visible. Attracting the eyes of passersby, a looming inflatable form rises above the walkway of the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts and enormous cubes of gray-tiled backpacks linger near the entrance of Northwest Labs.
And visibility is the goal. “The point [of “The Divine Comedy”] is to change how people conceive of the yard, to transform people’s conceptions of art,” said Dan F. Borelli, Director of Exhibitions at the GSD. He emphasizes the openness of the installations, which are located in the GSD’s Gund Hall, on the terrace of the Carpenter Center, and outside of Northwest Labs. “The project is about art in the public domain. Each of the three sites is publicly accessible. There’s no admission. There’s an open-door policy,” Borelli said.
This artistic “open-door policy” is uncommon for the Harvard Art Museums. “Compared to [Massachusetts Institute of Technology], Harvard has a little bit of a void when it comes to public art ... there isn’t a public art curator,” said Suelin Chen, Director of the Laboratory at Harvard, “so it’s really great for Harvard to have these types of projects happen.”
The installation placed on the terrace of the Carpenter Center is Tomás Saraceno’s “Cloud City,” which explores our relationship to the cosmos. The installation, as curator Sanford Kwinter wrote on “The Divine Comedy” website, is an “air-filled, seven-meter-tall, 14-sided, irregular, transparent structure loaded with solar cells, sensors, recorders, and transmitters intended not only to record the environment but to incorporate and be integrated into it as well.” Olafur Eliasson’s “Three to Now,” located in Gund Hall, looks inward and deals with differences in individual perception. As Kwinter describes, “Perceiver and perceived are indissociable—to alter one, without exception, is to alter the other.” However, perhaps the most visible work of them all is that of Chinese activist and artist Ai Weiwei, whose installation “Untitled” is placed on the lawn in front of Northwest Labs.
The story of Weiwei’s  “Untitled” is still in progress. Famed as the artistic consultant for design of the “Bird’s Nest,” the Beijing National Stadium for the 2008 Summer Olympics—and renowned later for his combative stance towards the oppressive Chinese government during the games—Weiwei was captured and placed under arrest on April 3. His release, like the fates of his family and collaboraters, remains uncertain.
“Untitled,” is concerned with yet another facet of Weiwei’s political activism. The installation, Kwinter wrote, makes public the findings of a year-long “‘Citizens’ Investigation’ of the May 2008 Sichuan Province earthquake ... on behalf of the thousands of student victims of the disaster.” Thousands of schoolchildren, many whose names are still unknown, were killed in the disaster. “After the earthquake, the government didn’t release the names of the victims, so [Ai Weiwei] used the Internet to gather those names,” Chen said.
In the “Citizen’s Investigation,” Ai Weiwei initiated a survey of 150 schools in 74 towns to recover the names, birth dates, and the names of the schools of the children who were killed. The project was not looked kindly upon by the national government. “The investigation uncovered the subsequently widely reported fact that the defective ‘tofu construction’ of school buildings played a principal role in the disproportionately high mortality rate of schoolchildren, a fact that was strenuously covered up by government authorities,” Kwinter wrote.
Each child recorded by Weiwei’s investigation is commemorated by one of the 5,335 backpacks on display in “Untitled.” “It makes a huge aesthetic impact as you walk up to the building ... you can walk through it, around it, and just the scale of it ... it’s monumental,” Chen said.
Beyond just the aesthetic impact, though, this is a piece of art imbued explicitly with a sense of activism. “From what I’ve read of Ai Weiwei, he felt a responsibility to talk about [what the government covered up] in a vacuum where some people felt that they couldn’t. It’s being a responsible citizen,” Borelli said.
While Ai Weiwei remains hidden away in prison, his art—and the work of his contemporaries in “The Divine Comedy”—is in plain view, presented for all to see and to remember.

In the cutthroat worlds of our professional lives, how does the relationship between fact and fabrication evolve, and how far will we go to get ahead? Tracy Scott Wilson’s “The Story” seeks to examine this interplay of fact and fiction in the competitive world of journalism. The central question of the play’s plot, according to director Benny Sato Ambush, is “What is the truth and where is the truth?”
“The Story” is a whodunit tale that revolves around young journalist Yvonne, who gets caught up in a murder story and attempts to get to the bottom of the mystery. Dealing with themes of journalistic integrity, sensationalism, and race and class relations, its narrative draws its essence from Wilson’s two main inspirations: the famous account of Janet Leslie Cooke’s scandal of journalistic fabrication and the racially charged story of the Charles Stuart murder.
This production will be the first in three years that features a guest professional director at the New College Theatre. Director of Memorial Hall/Lowell Hall Complex Eric C. Engel says, “One of the things I am particularly excited about for this production is the mix of student designers and professional designers.” Working on set of “The Story” will be a professional director, costume designer, and sound designer.
Following the 2 p.m. show on April 30, there will also be a panel discussion with members of the Nieman Foundation of Journalism at Harvard University to discuss elements of the play.
According to Staff Producer Dana Knox, “[“The Story”] is a brisk play, 75 minutes without intermission … It’s an energized, heart-racing run for all these journalists to break the story first. How are they going to break it? How are they going to spin it?”
Ambush added that “The Story” is a play that should resonate with many audiences and “that drive in career ambition is something I think all young people can relate to in making their mark in their desired profession.”­

Loeb Experimental Theater
Directed by Tyler G. Hall ’11
Produced by Matthew J. DaSilva ’12
A good comedy writer never laughs at his own jokes. “Is [the script] still funny to you?” “Sphinx: A Sketch Show” staff writer David A. Brescia asks director Tyler G. Hall ’11. To which Hall responds, “It’s not funny at all!”
“Sphinx” is a student-written and produced show with contributions from members of On Harvard Time, the Lampoon—a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine—Hasty Pudding Theatricals, and various improvisational comedy groups on campus. “We’ve assembled a Harvard Comedy All-Star team, with minimal steroid use,” staff writer and cast member Molly O. Fitzpatrick ’11, also a Crimson arts editor, writes in an email. In truly collaborative style, many different people were responsible for coming up with ideas for sketches. Writers would “throw around ideas until someone [said] something funny,” Brescia says.
“Sphinx” was born out of the desire to create a sketch show with a continuous theme. In the end, they decided to make a sketch show about life itself. “[‘Sphinx’] started out amorphous, but towards the end we became a lot more driven,” says Hall.
The inspiration for the show comes from the Sphinx’s Riddle: What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon, and three legs at night? The answer, of course, is man. In accordance with the riddle, the show consists of sketches about all walks of life, ranging from weddings to funerals, from classrooms to family homes. In one sketch, an elementary school child presents a book report on an erotic novel. In another, a man is confronted by his daughter’s stuffed animals about his alcohol problems and pathetic life. Hall promises surprisingly intricate sets and props for such short scenes.
Despite its basis in mythology, Hall says, “It’s not as highbrow as we make it sound.”  According to Hall, “shows should just be about jokes and no pretension.” In order to avoid confusion, he adds, “we’re advertising all these Egyptian sphinxes, but the show has nothing to do with Egyptian sphinxes.” He continues, “We’re flying on the seat of our pants over here.”

After almost two hours of irreverent jokes, meandering plotlines, and tiptoeing around the issues that it seeks to confront, “Sons of the Prophet” reaches its climax at a school board meeting. Star football player Vin (Jonathan Louis Dent), whose prank resulted in the death of the protagonist’s father, trots on stage to deliver an apology. But three-quarters of his mumbled plea consists of a quote from The Doors. “We just wanted to hear your own words!” complains one onlooker. This evasion unfortunately characterizes Stephen Karam’s new play in its entirety: while the laughs come just as thick as they did in his debut, “Speech & Debate,” “Sons of the Prophet” fails to engage fully with both its nascent plot and its underlying themes. The Huntington Theatre’s production, which runs until May 1 at the Boston Center for the Arts, cannot overcome the deficiencies of Karam’s source material despite technical excellence and a pair of standout performances.
“Sons of the Prophet” follows two brothers, second-generation Lebanese immigrants to rural Nazareth, Pa., as they cope with the death of their father in a prank-induced car crash. The older Joseph (Kelsey Kurz), who suffers from a mysterious dilapidating illness, and the younger, Converse-sporting Charles (Dan McCabe) are both gay, and as the story progresses it tangentially confronts questions of sexuality and religion, immigration and racism, and football obsession in rural America. The play’s essential flaw is that it doesn’t treat these issues thoroughly enough. Faced with an embarrassment of thematic riches, Karam squeezes a few laughs out of his chosen issues but little else. “You should feel lucky you have a central nervous system for your body to attack,” jokes Joseph in imitation of his father, but until the totally unprecedented explosion at the school board meeting, the play doesn’t dig much deeper.
One consequence of this superficiality is a lack of development in the characters—a problem that may partially explain several rather flat performances. In potentially emotionally loaded roles, Kurz and McCabe deliver their jokes with panache but struggle with more dramatic aspects. With the exception of one or two shouting matches and a final scene in which Joseph quietly breaks down in physical therapy, neither displays much feeling at all, though whether this is due more to the actors themselves or to Karam’s refusal to flesh out his characters is unclear. In contrast, the older members of the cast turn in scene-stealing performances. Best of all is Joanna Gleason as Gloria, Joseph’s lonely, clueless boss. Whether confusing Hamas and Hezbollah or telling her son, “I don’t want to scare you but I’m afraid I might do something awful,” she adeptly conveys a woman on the edge of a nervous breakdown. Yusef Bulos as the brothers’ uncle Bill also impresses with a combination of borderline racism and righteous anger about his brother’s untimely death. His direct, deeply un-PC proclamations keep the play from drifting too far from its dramatic center.
The Huntington’s production benefits from strong technical elements. From a jolting opening sequence simulating the car crash to the penultimate school board meeting scene—which transforms the entire theater into a school auditorium and has various characters emerge from the front row to take the stage—innovative staging keeps the audience engaged when the directionless plot cannot. Subtle but effective lighting also helps keep order when the stage fragments into multiple simultaneous interactions. Expressive piano riffs somewhat cursorily fill the gaps between the scenes, but with that single exception the production staff do as much as possible to marshal the scattershot “Sons of the Prophet.”
They can’t do it alone. The cast too makes a valiant effort, but ultimately all are hamstrung by ponderous plot development, jokes that—uncharacteristically for Karam—skirt the issues at hand, and ultimately a lack of dramatic courage. The play itself, not the production, is an exercise in unfulfilled potential.

For Harvard theater, the wait is finally over. Godot, or at least “Waiting for Godot” has finally made its first appearance in a Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club production: its signature absurdism was showcased in four performances in the Loeb Drama Center’s Experimental Theater from April 14 to 16. The show, directed by Jan Luksic ’11, arrived with its familiar characters, set, and overall interpretation. Still, the wait felt far from stagnant. The play’s five-person cast brilliantly charged their characters with the heightened joy, anxiety, and pain that come from human interaction in a space that felt as confining as the characters’ own circumstances.
Samuel Beckett’s story—or lack thereof—centers around a perpetually delayed meeting between the titular character and two aimlessly wandering comrades, Didi (Christopher J. Carothers ’11) and Gogo (Peter K. Bestoso ’14). During their two days spent by a lonely tree in an unspecified region, Didi and Gogo discuss and sometimes argue the many perplexing elements of their lives and present situation. Each day they encounter the eccentric Pozzo (Ilker Oztop) and his psychologically damaged slave Lucky (Tony J. Sterle ’11). Collectively, they analyze their seemingly meaningless existence as well as their unbreakable ties to Godot and to each other.
Carothers and Bestoso mastered the roles of the goofy, bickering pals with constant awareness of one another. As the dependent, child-like half of the pair, Bestoso relied equally on body language and voice to express the frustration of feeling helplessly trapped in one’s own directionless life. Bestoso made simple movements, such as removing his shoes, hyperactive without feeling over the top, and voiced his complaints—“Why won’t you help me?” and “Someone gave me a kick!” in a strangely poignant whine.
Carothers, animated in his character’s anxiety, energized the occasionally lifeless classic with his rapid but articulate delivery. At times, however, Carothers’ exuberance got the better of his character, giving a sustained comic tone to lines that deserved more subtle treatment. But Carothers’ improvisational energy served him well; he gave a lengthy stare to a late audience member who walked blatantly into his line of sight and cracked a smile at Oztop’s awkward, desperate handstand.
Neither Carothers nor Bestoso, however, was truly able to connect with his character on stage until the second act, before which they took the backseat to Oztop’s entertaining but outrageous stage presence. In probably the most memorable performance in the show, Oztop dominated much of the first act with stomping motions, violent outbursts, and maniacal stares. But Oztop also demonstrated his versatility as an actor by quickly subduing hysteria and adding some physical comedy. When Oztop returned in the second act to play the now-blind Pozzo, he spent most of his time collapsed on the stage, performing protracted somersaults in his attempts to stand or crying for “pi-tee!” with perfect comic timing.
Fortunately, the second act belonged mostly to Bestoso and Carothers, so the leading actors could finally expand beyond the first act’s witty and fast-paced dialogue. Together they expressed the play’s poignant thoughts on friendship, life, and the isolation found in both. Carothers’ most emotionally powerful moment on stage may have been a scene in front of the lonely tree in which he asked, “Tomorrow when I wake, or think I do, what will I think of today?”
For all of the cast’s success on stage, most viewers familiar with Beckett probably recognized the story and its bewildering antics almost instantly. The most noticeable changes from a standard “Godot” production were probably the costumes of the characters, each a single color or shade, as well as the prominent placement of the iconic tree. Instead of standing upright on stage, the tree hung from the overhead rafters, creating a physical barrier for the actors with its large protruding branches. The tree, along with the audience sitting on either side of the stage and the large mirrors hanging at both ends, complemented the characters’ feelings of entrapment.
The placement of the stage, tree, and audience also worked well to involve the viewer in the story’s multiple plot and character loops. Whenever an actor exited the stage on one side he was sure to enter at the opposite end; actors circled the audience and distorted the normal rules of space and time. For all these innovations in staging, this “Godot” did not feel especially groundbreaking. Nonetheless, it was an effective—however conservative—rendition of a classic.

The South: drawling pleasantries, belles in white flowing dresses, magnolia trees ruffled by a balmy breeze. Alternatively: damning profanity, bigots in white flowing robes, and lynched bodies hanging from blood-stained trees. Director Joshua R. McTaggart ’13, also a Crimson arts comper, melded these polarized facets of the South into a pageant of dancing, singing, condemnation, and retribution in “Parade,” which ran in the New College Theatre from April 14 to 17. The actors created a compelling narrative kindled by smooth directing and standout vocal performances, driving the musical’s ruthless critique of the concept of justice.
“Parade,” written by Alfred Uhry and Jason Robert Brown, is based on the true story of Leo Frank (Elliott J. Rosenbaum ’12), a Jewish factory owner in Georgia accused of the murder of his 13-year-old employee Mary Phagan (MaryGabrielle Prezioso ’13). During a sensationalized trial, Frank is found guilty and sentenced to death. Thanks to the help of his wife, Lucille Frank (Amelia H. Ross ’14), Frank’s sentence is commuted by the Governor (Christian Ronald ’13) to life in prison. The Governor’s decision prompts an outburst of racist extremism, throwing the divisions of early 20th century Southern society into sharp relief.
Leo’s and Lucille’s relationship, which could easily have been forgotten in favor of the more flashy and seductive musical numbers, centered the whole production. While the story begins with Lucille worried about Leo’s coldness, the evolution of their love over the course of the trial felt genuine and effortless. Ross’s rich resonant tones in “What Am I Waiting For?” evoked a sharp contrast to the angry high vibratos of the witch-hunting townsfolk, and Rosenbaum’s neurotic portrayal of Leo was perfectly understated.
The other main actors slipped into their archetypal roles with grace. Anise Molina ’14 as Frankie Epps, Mary’s vengeful admirer, sung and moved with the strength of ruddy-faced youth and complemented Prezioso’s airy ankle-fidgeting innocence perfectly. Meanwhile, Phil M. Gillen ’13 as Frank’s prosecutor adopted an evil Billy Flynn-like persona that clearly cast him as the leader of the mob. While Molina stood out as one of the strongest voices, sometimes overpowering the rest of the chorus, all of the actors sung with passion and emotion.
The supporting cast, aided by jagged yet eerily flowing choreography, powered through the flashier numbers. “Real Big News” showed a darker side of human nature as the whole cast partook in a demonic war dance condemning Leo Frank. Britt Craig (Adam J. Conner ‘14), the journalist who covers the trial, energetically led the way in one of the show’s most sensational numbers. In contrast, the haunting “Come Up into My Office,” in which three girls testify that Leo propositioned them, showed Rosenbaum’s diversity as he easily assumed the Humbert Humbert role complete with his aghast ladies and gentlemen of the jury. The three girls circling him as he turned away from the audience created a tangible example of how the imaginations of the townsfolk could scapegoat an innocent individual.
However, the main triumph of “Parade” was the cohesiveness of all the different storylines, created by a two-storied set design. The movement of characters up and down each staircase, through the back onto the main stage, and the lowering of Mary Phagan’s coffin into a trapdoor all suggested a fluidity of people sinking and rising into their pasts and futures. Leo, who begins the musical working away in his tower, transitions to the lower level in prison only to end the musical on the second story once again with Mary as she takes his hand to form a partnership in martyrdom.
Sound was one of the production’s few flaws. Several times the orchestra overpowered the singing and the microphones simply did not work. While the cast tried their best to overcome these setbacks, the acoustics of the New College Theatre worked against them. Despite these technical errors, the musical direction of Sam R. Schoenberg ’13 matched well with the cast, and the orchestra deftly handled the variation of music from anthem to reel to dance to ballad.
The uniform quality of the vocal talent, piercing acting, and flowing movement and blocking made “Parade” a success, creating an unusually strong harmony between the trappings of musical theater and the thematic issues the piece so wrenchingly confronts. The direction of the play let the story of an innocent man condemned by bigotry take center stage instead of wallowing in superficial distractions.

Leah Reis-Dennis ’13 is a history and literature concentrator living in Eliot House. A member of the Harvard Opportunes and a soul group called The Nostalgics, she will give her first solo performance of jazz, soul, and R&B standards at the Holyoke Center on April 29.
 
The Harvard Crimson: When did you first start singing?
Leah Reis-Dennis: I’ve always sung. When I was very little, I used to stand in front of the refrigerator and just make songs out of the words on the different magnets. I was in my first musical when I was 11, and then after that I just fell in love with performing and singing. I started taking lessons when I got to high school, and then everything blew up from there.
 
THC: Harvard has so many different a cappella groups. What influenced you to choose the Opportunes?
LRD: The Opportunes really struck me at first as a group with really strong female soloists, and [it] was really exciting for me to see those girls get up there and just belt it out. Once I started getting to know the group, the social dynamic and the kind of family that the group fostered was really appealing to me, in addition to the repertoire. I sang a lot of jazz in high school, and as a performer and soloist, I tend to sing a lot of jazz and soul. So I like that the Opportunes gave me a chance to do that, but also gave me a chance to branch out in singing country or more contemporary pop.
 
THC: What was your favorite piece that you performed with the Opportunes?
LRD: I really loved singing “Wonderful” by Annie Lennox. I’ve worked on that for a while and performed it at the [semifinals of the] International Championship of Collegiate A Capella. ... But on a regular basis my favorite song that we do is “Midnight Train to Georgia” because I just love that song.
 
THC: Do you plan on continuing your singing after graduation?
LRD: I do, which is a recent decision. I always thought that singing was just a hobby and that I’d probably get a ‘real’ job, which is still a possibility, but more and more I’m realizing that I really love to sing and perform. I feel like I have what it takes to make it, and I’ll regret it if I don’t try. That’s currently my plan after graduation: I’ll go to New York and see what happens. 
 
THC: What kind of singing do you hope to pursue?
LRD: Probably whatever I can get, because in the music industry, everyone’s a beggar, and beggars can’t be choosers. I would prefer to do something like Adele or Amy Winehouse because they are my prototypes—but of course without the Amy Winehouse crazy drug issues. The Broadway musical scene is really changing because it used to be dominated by jazz-hand types of musicals, but now [that there are] all these new modern rock musicals like “American Idiot” and “Spring Awakening,” I think there is a greater opportunity to be cast as someone who doesn’t fit the ‘Broadway baby’ profile, someone with a more rock or soul kind of voice. I’m hopeful that that could pan out.
 
THC: Tell me about your upcoming performance during Arts First.
LRD: It will be my first time striking out on my own in the soul genre. I’ll be singing covers: some Adele, “Killing Me Softly” by Lauryn Hill [and featuring the Fujees], and others from the modern soul rock genre. I think my voice naturally tends towards jazz; I grew up listening to jazz, so whatever I do is infused with that. It will be really interesting since I’m so used to singing jazz with groups. I don’t know what the reception will be like as a soloist. Most of my experience singing as a soloist has been in high school musical theater or with jazz combos, but I’m really excited and hope people enjoy it.
 
THC: You lead Harvard Students for Choice. How do you balance your political activism with singing?
LRD: Everyone here at Harvard is busy and so I find that there’s time for both. I don’t know if these are two things that I’ll eventually be able to fuse, but in the ultimate fantasy world, if I were to become a famous singer, I would definitely continue to be an advocate for reproductive justice. It’s never something that I could abandon because I think that women’s rights and women’s health are so crucial, and I will continue to stand up for that, whether it’s writing blogs or going to protests, no matter where I end up.

‘Classical music’ conjures images of grand orchestras and animated conductors paying heed to the western canon. While all of these were present in “Chinese Symphonic Masterpiece II: A Journey to the West,” music director and conductor Hanjay Wang ’11 made a complete departure from a typical classical music concert by juxtaposing a popular Western piece with lesser-known Eastern-inspired works. By providing a fresh interpretation of an age-old tradition, Wang inspired a dialogue to address the plethora of approaches to music.
“A Journey to the West” took place April 15 in Paine Hall as a sequel performance to “Chinese Symphonic Masterpieces.” The concert began with Taiwanese folk-inspired “Plum Blossom Country” by Masaaki Hayakawa and ended with “Allegro from Piano Concerto No. 5 in E-flat major, Op. 73 ‘Emperor’” by German composer Ludwig van Beethoven. In this movement from east to west, the newly composed piece “Journey to the West” served as both a transition and the focal point.
Award-winning American composer and Program Assistant at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Science Oliver L Caplan composed the concert’s namesake. Inspired by renowned novel “Journey to the West” by Wu Cheng’en, the composition was a musical representation of the protagonist’s pilgrimage to India as atonement for past sins. The protagonist, monkey Sun Wu Kong, is a bold and mischievous king with extraordinary magical talent. The composition follows his journey of personal growth from a playful, puckish monkey to reflective, mature hero over the course of four movements. 
Caplan took ample time to conceptualize the intellectual framework for the piece before he made any of the movements. Latching onto the theme of personal growth in the novel, Caplan sought to take one melody and represent it in four contrasting ways in the four movements. Soloists Kevin Leu ’11 on the flute and Charles Vanijcharoenkarn ’11 on the erhu were cast as the yin and yang of the monkey’s character, Caplan said. Leu embodied the yang as the fiery and mischievous side in the first movement, “Monkey’s Mischief,” while Vanijcharoenkarn represented the more soulful and softer part of the monkey’s personality in the second movement, “Mountain of the Five Elements.”  The third movement showcased the orchestra as a whole as the monkey makes his journey to India to retrieve Buddhist scriptures and bring them to China.  In the final movement, “Illumination,” the flute and erhu soloists played in duet to symbolize that the yin and yang of the monkey’s character were finally achieving balance.
After meeting Caplan through a professor in the OEB department, Wang enthusiastically asked him to compose a piece based on “Journey to the West.”  Both found the experience extremely meaningful. “Working with Oliver is something really special because we are getting the chance to work with an up and coming composer.  He brings a lot of excitement to the event,” Wang said.
Other highlights of the evening’s performance included piano soloist and associate of the Music Department at Harvard University Seda Röder, as well as live electronics by Edgar Barroso, a PhD candidate in Music Composition at Harvard. Both were featured in the culminating piano concerto. Several alumni and staff members were also highlighted as guest musicians in the orchestra. “We really get a sense of the holistic community at Harvard with this performance. The student and staff collaboration is very close in this production,” Caplan said. 
Encouraged by positive feedback from audience members and featured orchestra musicians after last year’s “Chinese Symphonic Masterpieces,” Wang decided to do a second concert this year.  He said that the process of following such a successful concert was very challenging.  After playing two of the most famous works of Chinese symphonic music last year, Wang came up with the concept of having an eastern and western fusion concert for this year’s performance. 
Days before the event, Caplan described how anxiously he waited to hear the whole program contiguously.  Planning the concert as a journey from east to west was a novel concept. “Hanjay is an extremely gifted conductor. I’ve been very impressed seeing him work in rehearsal,” Caplan said. “He has a very natural musicality, and his student peers respond very well to him.  He has such a natural sense of the score.”
Chinese Symphonic Masterpieces I and II have ignited excitement amongst both students and faculty members at Harvard. Wang’s cross-cultural innovation represents a greater movement towards cohesion across cultural divides.

“If home is where the heart is begging, then my home is inside you,” sings tUnE-yArDs’ Merrill Garbus on the track “You Yes You” from the new album “WHOKILL.” This line, though ostensibly innocuous, functions as a perfect demonstration of how this album develops its unsettling power. A clever variation on an idiom, the phrase slips into the ears lightly and harmlessly. But as its echo dies away, dark undertones emerge, revealing a desperate, lascivious, almost murderous sentiment that lasts long after the saccharine voice that sings it.
“WHOKILL” works within the paradigm of strict and recognizable pop forms, complete with verses, choruses, driving beats, and incessantly repeating motifs. Garbus and her crew reveal the hidden potential of these hackneyed forms by injecting them with a pungent dose of dissonant, noisy, and violent elements. What results is a quirky and unpredictable album that sounds clean and expertly crafted as it plumbs the shadows of its unsettling world.
A heavy, ringing tom beat complemented by unbalanced, harmonizing bird calls inaugurates the album on the track “My Country,” a wild and jarringly frenetic tune that equates American inequality with romantic rejection. Despite a repetitive form, new nuances and timbres arise with every turn, like the lush synths that explode half-way through or the unsynchronized saxophones that add confusion and discomfort to the dissolving outro. Even with such unremitting unpredictability, Garbus’ vocals take front and center as one of the most riotous and impressive elements in the mix. Within one song, she leaps, she screams, she coos, she whispers, she serenades, she harmonizes with herself, and she crams a tremendous number of syllables into her rapid-fire lines. “My Country” represents zeal taken several steps too far, and this serves as a perfect setting for an ironic portrayal of U.S. opportunism.
Lyrical irony abounds as the album cartwheels from subject to subject. The bouncy “Es-So” sets a simultaneously infectious and eerie groove while featuring a repeated voiceover of Garbus muttering, “I gotta do right if my body’s tight, right?” in her best Valley Girl impression. The creeping dissonance and nihilistic synths that brood within the cracks of this tune’s tonality suggest the emptiness and evil behind this character’s bougie façade, a sentiment further reflected in the lyrics: “Sometimes I’ve got the jungle under my skin / Draw back the ribbon, stick a fucking fork in / Bathe it all in a wave of disgust / I can’t believe I ate the whole thing.” Such irony becomes heavy-handed on tracks like “Gangsta” and, later, “Killa.” “Gangsta” delivers the violent boasts of a suburban warlord, complete with ambulance sounds and the cringe-worthy refrain, “Never move to my hood / ’Cause danger is crawling out the wood,” while “Killa” features a hackneyed attempt at all-too-easy yuppie criticism.
Despite these more inane elements, the music maintains its madcap curiosity throughout a multiplicity of different moods and tempos, like the ominous tip-toe of “Riotriot,” the 50s bubblegum bounce of “Doorstep,” and the Portishead-like lullaby of “Wolly Wolly Gong.” “Powa” is a distinct highlight, a moderate and spare pop ballad that finds Garbus at her most soulful. Consisting of nothing but bass, drums, guitar, and some very light electronic nuances, this song is a brief respite from the violent world surrounding it. Periodic chasms of reverb suggest some lurking nihilism, but Garbus repeatedly fends it off with a warm melodic sensibility.
“Bizness,” the sole single from “WHOKILL,” is an indie pop gem, based on a colorful vocal sample that spreads across its 4.5 minutes like a shimmering rainbow. The moderate, drumstick-click drive that guides the tune along its standard verse-chorus structure gradually snowballs with new voices, until a veritable symphony of percussion, bass, guitars, and horns accompanies Garbus’ wild vocals. She sounds unhinged, delivering screeches and growls through cut-up samples and odd electronic filters, and hurriedly pleading, “Don’t take my life away / Don’t take my life away.” “Bizness” is a perfect demonstration of what tUnE-yArDs executes so well. Garbus’ ability to incorporate messy and unexpected features into traditional pop structures allows her to create music that transcends the lo-fi and the hi-fi by mashing the best of both.
Garbus’ universe is one of lurking monsters, battleground neighborhoods, weight-conscious 20-somethings, and a ubiquitous sense of approaching madness. “For your sleep is guard against the cold and hard / A soft shroud of safety in a world gone wrong,” she sings. “WHOKILL” can be an unsettling, unpleasant, and quite frightening experience. However, the music is so consistently inventive and engaging that it invites countless repeat listens. Unease has rarely sounded this good.

“Young liars, thank you for taking my hand,” TV on the Radio frontman Tunde Adebimpe hypnotically sang, extending his hands to his audience. On April 16 the five-man Brooklyn band captivated the audience in the House of Blues with their unique blend of rock in a show that deftly combined nearly equal amounts from each of their four critically-acclaimed records.
TV on the Radio did not draw heavily from their latest release “Nine Types of Light” and thereby represented the unbelievable depth and diversity of their stylistic range. Following the opening “Young Liars,” a rhythmic, repetitive song that pulled the audience into the concert’s mesmeric atmosphere, the band segued into an unrelentingly raucous rendition of “Halfway Home,” a song from their previous record “Dear Science.” The enthusiasm of the band was electric—from shout-outs to Boston to Adebimpe’s frenzied jumping, “Halfway Home” set an upbeat, forceful tone that the group sustained for the rest of the concert.
TV on the Radio has always been concerned with overall presentation and performance over specific song craft—their latest album was released with an hour long film. The visual aspect of their sound was represented not only by their energy but also by the fantastic light show. In addition to stage lights, individual beams of light shot out from the stage, silhouetting the band above the audience. Their lighting perfectly reflected the mood, lyrics, and groove of each song. Nowhere was this more apparent than in “Blues from Down Here,” a throwback to their 2006 album “Return to Cookie Mountain,” where the band’s assault of rhythmic sound during the line “pull the pin, drop it in, let it wash away your” was mirrored with flashing, ecstatic lights.
Despite the general aura of frenetic excitement, not every song was loud and upbeat, and it was in the more contemplative songs that TV on the Radio’s intricate and careful staging best complemented the music. In “Will Do,” the love-lorn first single off “Nine Types of Light,” the band seemed to seduce the audience; singing “Your love makes a fool of you / You can’t seem to understand” as the blue-swathed staged took on an otherworldly glow with the addition of small pink lights. Adebimpe garnered much attention for his acting in “Rachel Getting Married,” and he brings his expressive nature to his live shows as well. Set against a fog-filled stage, Adebimpe looked lost in the haze as he soulfully sang “You don’t want to waste your life in the middle of a lovesick lullaby.”
TV on the Radio’s incorporation of looping and, more recently, trombone is a unique highlight of their records, and these elements translate well to a live setting. It’s hard to imagine “Crying” and “Red Dress”—both tracks from “Dear Science”—without their signature trombone parts. On the end of “Province,” the song quiets to an eerie loop that sustains and then fades. With the addition of looping, trombone and a strange, tambourine-esque percussive instrument, TV on the Radio was truly able to capture the spirit of their albums in the venue. As they stripped off their albums’ layers of production, they revealed an equally compelling unpolished sound.
In perhaps the band’s most famous—and the concert’s loudest—song, “Wolf Like Me,” TV on the Radio unleashed a furious blast of percussion as Adebimpe sang “Open my hand and let it bleed onto yours,” again extending his hands to the audience, climbing onto a pedestal and pantomimed some of the song’s most salient images for the enthusiastic crowd.
Their final song “Satellite,” which like their opening number “Young Liars” came from their EP, encapsulated the upbeat, groove-based mood of the entire concert. In a song that, recorded, is relatively quiet, Adebimpe’s repetitive “I’m waiting for a signal or a sound, where can you be found now? Where can you be found now, my love, where can you be, waiting for a signal or a sound?” became an explosive finale. “I am the undertow,” he sang, tellingly immersing the audience once more in TV on the Radio’s hypnotic world.

Strange as it is to name a rock band after a body part, the origins of the name “Elbow” seem oddly appropriate to this band. The name is based on the idea that ‘elbow’ is the most sensual English word—not for its meaning, but purely for the way it feels to say it. Similarly, even if the lyrics on “Build a Rocket Boys!” seem incomprehensible, they are undeniably haunting and evocative because of their sound and complementary musical backing.
British alt-rock band Elbow have been critics’ darlings for years, but have rarely achieved commercial success. But “Build a Rocket Boys!” follows their fourth album “The Seldom Seen Kid,” which went double platinum. This success is unprecedented for a band that prizes intellectualism so highly, but the group’s signature strategy of combining poetically oblique lyrics with tastefully restrained instrumentals merits the attention they’ve recently garnered.
Lead singer Gus Garvey engages most frequently with emotional themes that could easily seem hackneyed. The true appeal of his lyrics is his ability to conjure powerful emotional responses through strange images and an intimately personal tone. On “With Love,” the band sounds happy and youthfully exuberant. Yet they do not express it through any of the obvious clichés, instead presenting the carefully crafted, “Best intentions bring joyless droughts / Pack your hacksaw, come push me out / When your dentures prevent your smile / These adventures will fill your eyes.”
The album is not confined to themes of love, and “With Love” is followed just a few songs later by the dolorous “The River.” The song derives its power from restraint, managing to stretch just eight lines of lyrics over three minutes of music. Garvey does so with confident rests between each line that are somehow more engaging than booming melodies or catchy beats ever would be. He seems unhurried as he delivers his choice few lines, frequently holding his pauses so long that the music completely fades to comfortable silence. The lyrical theme of regret—“I told him my sorrows and broken-down dreams / Confessed every lie, replayed every scene”—is supported by the spare and halting piano and guitar melodies.
Though the music is meant mainly to support the lyrics, the instrumentals resist stagnation through carefully controlled dynamic shifts. The eight-minute  album opener, “The Birds,” is subdued for the first half, the percussion slow and unchanging, the words floating over it. About halfway through, however, the song adopts a sense of urgency, building tension through a balance of new instrumental layers. As the music shifts, the same lyrics that Garvey has been singing the whole time seem completely different: “Looking back is for the birds,” Garvey sings at the end. Though the meaning is vague, the weight of the music lends it significance.
Though the music frequently supports the lyrics, it sometimes serves as an intriguing counterpoint—“The Night Will Always Win,” one of the stranger tracks on the album, succeeds due to this tension. Throughout the song, Garvey sings in slow, longing verses, but the actual words he is singing seem to be ripped off of an emo, Dashboard Confessional-type album: “I miss your stupid face / I miss your bad advice.” While such lyrics are typically backed by thrashing guitars, when backed merely by a soft piano, they are oddly jarring and engaging. Instead of simply letting the song mellow with the piano, Garvey creates a noticeable tension between his lyrics and the music that keeps the song fresh.
“Build a Rocket Boys!” is a deeply evocative album, and it works off the concept that the power of lyrics lies not in their meaning but in their relationship with backing music and the vague images and emotions they conjure. This is haunting music that, while indirect in meaning, is potent in effect.

Though celebrated for years in the indie hip-hop realm, Del the Funky Homosapien remains relatively unknown outside of his collaborations with Gorillaz and the fact that he’s Ice Cube’s cousin. “Golden Era” suggests contentment with his level of fame, and the album makes no effort to change his critically-acclaimed style of blending quirky, precise lyrics with relaxed funk beats. Part of a 3-disk set including older digital-only released albums “Automatik Statik” and “Funk Man,” “Golden Era” comes right out of Oakland packed with ten more tracks of brilliant lyricism. While some tracks suffer from thoughtless instrumentals, the album succeeds by underscoring his poetic prowess as an indie-rap star.
Del escalated into fame with a style distinct from the more grim California gangsta rap like that of his cousin Ice Cube; his was a funk-inspired, versatile, and innovative brand with a classic ’90s rap flavor. Best known perhaps for his appearance on Gorillaz’s singles “Clint Eastwood” and “Rock the House,” Del helped Gorillaz achieve their astounding chart success. “The Golden Era” comes after his latest, album “It Ain’t Illegal Yet,” which was available on the internet at an unfixed rate.
The memorable track “Makes No Sense” directly addresses Del’s obstinate refusal to forsake his idiosyncratic style in favor of mainstream rap. He attacks belligerent ‘haters’ that “launch personal attacks” and calls for some humbling and self-analysis. In his hook, he raps “Everything you try to say really don’t make no sense to me / The way that you act and misbehave really don’t make no sense to me.” Much of the album’s lyrics are outwardly directed towards dismissive, mainstream listeners: “My vision will play out as intended /  I don’t care who the fuck is offended.” Indeed, Del’s refusal to give up his own sound leads him to define himself against others in the mainstream. While this lyrical theme could be limiting, Del’s humorous and swift wordplay keep his raps from becoming dull.
“One Out of a Million” also embodies Del’s traditional sound. As he makes the case for himself as a uniquely talented rapper, he makes yet another assault on unappreciative listeners: “My secret vow is to beat the style into the hard heads who aren’t impressed.  / Who you know who come as hard as this?” he asks, before launching into one of his strange lines:  “Put pressure on ‘em just like a zit.” Where his rap posturing might seem typical, his bizarre zit simile suggests a lightheartedness not typically found in similarly self-aggrandizing raps. Not only does he show his adept rhythmic talent through his effortlessly rapid flow, but he fearlessly flaunts his playful sense of humor.
While his lyrical talent keeps his similar themes from running together across tracks, he does not succeed in distinguishing his instrumentals. Many songs fall into the same mid-tempo funk grooves, and often the unimpressive instrumentals change little between tracks. Quality rhymes get lost in certain tracks like “Pearly Gates” where the percussion is overpowering and distracting. The funk-inspired instrumentals serve as a signifier of his rejection of mainstream club rap, but do little to actually support his lyrics.
As he frequently points out, Del’s music might be an acquired taste. Despite the potential inaccessibility of his sound, Del yet again refuses to sacrifice originality to be part of mainstream ringtone rap. He remains consistent and continues to showcase what he does best—delivering powerful, raw lyrics while simultaneously not taking himself too seriously. Though he could benefit from experimenting with more diverse instrumentals, Del defends his idiosyncrasies well on “Golden Era.” Extremely underrated, Del recalls pre-gangster rap hip-hop’s best quality—carefree unconventionality.

“No, we are not beyond beauty,” the poet Carl Phillips ’81 once said in an interview. “I was out working in the garden yesterday, when the cathedral bells started ringing—it seemed to me a beautiful moment.” This statement might capture the essence of Phillips’ 11th book of poetry, “Double Shadow.” In the collection, his prayer-like poems create a magical, paganistic landscape that seems to offer visual sublimation for spiritual struggle, neither defying nor accepting skepticism. It is as if one were to re-learn through Phillips’ mystical imagery how to pray—a new kind of prayer inspired by faith, disbelief, or even the inability to choose between the two. Through his mystical imagery, Phillips reveals the beauty of what he calls “the willingness to abandon oneself to what can’t be proven to exist.”
That Phillips’ poems resemble prayers extends beyond a simple metaphor or an analogy, to the extent that they may actually be prayers. “Double Shadow” abounds with religious allusions. The poem “Ransom,” for instance, begins with a voice chanting: “How he was carried in a ramshackle cart alongside the sea. / How he lay on his side, on a bed of straw.” The “bed of straw” seems to allude to the Nativity of Jesus, a possibility further reinforced by other direct references to Jesus in the book. Phillips frequently uses anaphora—as here shown by the repetition of “how”—which is a formal feature of many biblical prayers. Moreover, Christian symbols and concepts, such as doves, forgiveness, and gratitude, regularly appear throughout the collection.
Phillips’ imagery, however, is not exclusively Christian; in fact, it is remarkable for its mélange of Christian and pagan concepts. Though there are no direct mentions of classical mythologies, the influence of Phillips’ classicist formation—he holds an A.B. in Greek and Latin from Harvard and taught Latin for eight years after graduation—is manifest as a source of inspiration. The poem “Through an Opening,” for example, explores the interior of the head of a wind god, where a golden steeple appears amid strange, primitive images, such as a “chicken hawk,” “first stars,” and “a field on fire.” What seems to be a scene of pagan ritual, both foreign and ancient to the current Western imagination, is brought together with Christianity. Such a mixture of historical idioms removes many metrics for space and time, rendering “Double Shadow” almost a pure spiritual abstraction.
Despite the strong spiritual undercurrent present in all his poems, Phillips’ religious conviction is never firm, but always wavering. In “The Shore,” for example, Phillips paradoxically questions the nature of prayers from within the poem. He writes, “in prayer (but / to what, or whom?)” The poem is neither wholly skeptical nor trying to overcome all doubts; rather, a dreamlike uncertainty constitutes the essence of “The Shore.” An italicized whisper, which could be an auditory embodiment of hesitance, opens the poem. “Don’t be afraid—Don’t go—Passenger me back to / a land called neither Honeycomb nor Danger,” Phillips writes. It never becomes clear what could have been so fearful or what “Honeycomb” and “Danger” might suggest.
In fact, there is never an answer to anything in “Double Shadow,” especially for spiritual questionings. “Prayer … to what, or whom?” One never finds out. In place of answers, Phillips creates a panorama of visual impressions. “The Shore” closes with an image of bodies “lifting, falling, sexual, like hammers, like / a hammer thrown up into and across where sky / had begun—slowly, then more slowly—to seem / too wrecked enough already to sustain more damage.” What this intertwinement of bodies and hammers might signify, again, one is never quite sure. But such striking images, which replace both faith and disbelief within the prayer-poems, accumulate one by one to create a distinct spiritual idiom that unites the entire collection.
This spiritual vocabulary might be Phillips’ proposal for a new kind of prayer, in face of what seems to be an impasse of belief for the poet and probably for many others. Perhaps no serious reader of literature could take faith for granted nowadays, especially after the atheistic utterances of monumental thinkers like Communist father Karl Marx and philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Hence he constantly expresses a nostalgic longing for the capacity to believe more readily. “Tonight—in the foundering night … where what I don’t in fact / believe anymore,” he begins in “Clear, Cloudless.” Yet his inability to believe is always countered by his inability to disbelieve, as if faith were a spiritual imperative. Phillips immediately contradicts himself in “Clear, Cloudless” by adding that what he does not believe anymore, “all the same, is true.” This conflicting spiritual state is sublimated through his mystical imagery, creating a new, multifaceted way to pray.
But all in all, if “Double Shadow” has a spiritual message, it is a hopeful one. Phillips’ visual poetry redirects the unresolved spirituality toward beauty and art, as in the moment when the cathedral bells rang across his garden, where resolution was beside the point. In the poem “Sky Coming Forward,” he asks, “What if, between this one and the one / we hoped for, there’s a third life, taking its own / slow, dreamlike hold, even now—blooming, in spite of us?” If the two preexisting lives are those of disbelief and faith, a third kind of spirituality burgeons in “Double Shadow”––a landscape through which Phillips’ stunning mastery of verse and imagery emanates.

In his 1999 poem “The Instruments,” Australian poet Les Murray wrote, “Poetry is read by lovers of poetry / and heard by some more they coax to the café / or the district library for a bifocal reading. / Lovers of poetry may total a million people / on the whole planet. Fewer than the players of skat.” Despite his somewhat negative outlook on the demand for poetry in the world, however, Murray has continued to be an impressively prolific poet. “Taller When Prone” is his twelfth collection of poetry. Written in simple, accessible verse, this latest collection showcases the poet’s penchant for wordplay, his sense of humor, and most importantly, his deep connection with the landscape and language of Australia.
Murray is, after all, at his best when he confronts the natural landscape, particularly that of his native country. The Australia that appears in his poems is a rough, rural place, full of unexpected moments of beauty. In “Southern Hemisphere Gardens,” one of the most evocative poems in the collection, Murray describes the land as an autumnal garden, lovely even its bareness: “This autumn grove, in the half world / that has no fall season, shows a mauve / haze all through its twig-sheaves / and over a rich spangled round / of Persian leaves.” The construction “twig-sheaves” is typical of Murray’s language, which is full of inventive wordplay.
As he renders the landscape of the Australian countryside, Murray demonstrates an impressive knowledge of the flora found there. In “The Cowladder Stanzas,” his speaker describes a certain flower found on the rural farms:  “Kniphofia flowers / overlapping many scarlet jubes / form rockets on a stick. / Ignition’s mimed by yellow petticoats.” In moments such as this one, Murray shows a naturalist’s understanding of the environment accompanied by a consistent ability to find fresh ways of expressing his observations.
In addition to his detailed portrayal of Australia’s landscape, Murray is also fastidious in his representation of the linguistic particularities of his country. In a note to Bluelookout Mountain, he writes, “the spelling Bluelookout as one word with the accent on the first syllable reflects local pronunciation.” As Murray’s speaker in “The Cowladder Stanzas” considers a series of names for his farm, he evokes both the linguistic and physical landscape of the countryside: “High Wallet, / Cow Terraces, Fogsheep, / Rainside, Helmet Brush, / Tipcamber, Dingo Leap.” At least for an American readership, there is little else more suggestive of Australia than the mention of a “Dingo.”
The variation of the English language is itself often the subject of Murray’s poems. In “The Drizzle of Chef’s Knives,” he describes the development of Australian English: “All of English was once forest / but it sailed to the lagoons. / Now our southern bush needs pipeline / to drink from the monsoons.” Throughout poems such as “The Drizzle of Chef’s Knives,” “A Frequent Flyer Proposes a Name,” and “Infinite Anthology,” Murray shows a complex understanding of the subtleties of language development, particularly with regards to the Australian vernacular.
In “Infinite Anthology,” Murray catalogs expressions with the care of a linguist, but he does not hide his own particular brand of humor. Examples from his catalogue include “bunny boiler – one who kills her offspring” and “shart – a non-dry fart.” Alongside these light-hearted entries, however, are his own enthusiastic pronouncements on the splendor of linguistic evolution: “Individual words, with their trains of definition loosening around them, allow us to visit the oracular and sense its renewing dance.”
Murray’s fascination with language mingles well with his interest in landscape. In his poem “The Farm Terraces,” Murray remarks on the similarities between the cultivation of land and the creation of poetry; he describes the terraces in the farmland as “Levels eyed up to rhyme / copied from grazing animals / round the steeps of the earth, / balconies filtering water / down stage to stage of drop.”
Even in the poems that do not expressly discuss the flexibility and wonder of language, the careful consideration that Murray pays to wording often leads to surprising, creative use of form and rhyme. In “The Death of Isaac Nathan, 1864,” for example, Murray manages to rhyme a phrase in Hebrew, “Melech ha-olam” with “Miss Havisham,” the name of a famed Dickens character.
Murray’s attention to form is evident especially in the short, almost haiku-like poems that appear sporadically throughout the collection.  Four lines at most, these brief, evocative poems exemplify Murray’s propensity for spare, expressive language. In Croc, he likens a police car to a crocodile, “a long-jawed / flat dog beside the traffic stream”; “Cattle-Hoof Hardpan” he compares “Trees from modern times” unfavorably with “the old China pear / still standing in the soil.”
When Murray turns away from his focus on the landscape and language of Australia, his poetry does not always reach the same level of inventiveness and charm. Murray’s verses are filled with color, but while his characterizations of the colors of the Australian landscapes are quite striking—the smoke from burning grass is a “web across the sun / and it ignites cut-glass rosé / goblets and pitchers”—his descriptions of, for example, the Italian landscape are less original. Poems such as “Midi,” which dwells on the lavender color of the Italian sky, and “Visiting Geneva” do not ring quite as true as those that focus on his native country.
There is, however, much to be admired in Murray’s latest collection, which cunningly captures the Australian tongue and terrain. Although in “The Instruments” Murray remarks on the rarity of poetry lovers, this collection is one of those that might even manage to coax the uninitiated into listening to the poet’s accessible voice and buoyant verse.

Some poets perform an act of creation that supersedes the poem as a mere vessel for thought or emotion. Instead, their writing generates a unique world that we may inhabit, coherent in its logic and distinct in the images that populate it. By spending time with a body of work, we become familiar with a poet, feel a fondness for his methods and metaphysics. Berryman’s Dream Songs or Keats’ Odes spring to mind immediately. In these cases, we find a poet’s landscape so convincing that we are able to lay our mind’s resistance to rest. Our newfound familiarity with the rules, like a secret language, is the source of our pleasure.
Yusef Komunyakaa’s “The Chameleon Couch” is another volume from an author whose creations could not be mistaken for the work of anyone else. Komunyakaa’s poems feel as if they have no ancestors, so busy are they in creating a mélange of jazz rhythms and poetic modernism, dark spirituality and personal confession. However, if we may say that Komunyakaa creates a unique world, Komunyakaa’s images are not wholly responsible for its singularity, arresting as they may be. Komunyakaa instead creates a world of suggestion and enigma, where what is withheld from the reader is just as important as what is revealed. In “The Cage, The Head,” Komunyakaa expands on the tense dynamic between poet and reader: “You sit inside a halved atlas. / Something for us to stare at / as you define us / by how long you hold a gaze.” Though Komunyakaa uses the second person to describe the strange talismanic figure, it remains unclear who is really in control. In “The Chameleon Couch,” it may be truer that the world entered into is more dependent on the power exercised on the reader by the author than any startling image.
The first and most observable achievement of Komunyakaa’s work is its effortless synthesis of images drawn from a diverse group of sources. The poet’s range of influences is remarkable: obscure religious rituals, jazz, Polish landscapes, the history of slavery, confidence men, Dante—the list goes on. An image is suggested and takes flight, only to reappear a few poems later in a new form. Often, Komunyakaa uses the idea of the ode as his jumping-off point, not necessarily apostrophizing the object but using it as a concrete subject around which his strands of imagery can swarm and refract. The subjects vary from the eponymous chameleon, the shakuhachi (a Japanese flute), Ravel’s Piano Concerto for the Left Hand, and figs.
Komunyakaa is a poet who, when naming names, is just as likely to invoke Thelonious Monk as he is Robert Lowell (though both are mentioned), and there’s a certain truth to the idea that his poems have an improvisatory quality to them. It is perhaps best to be skeptical about the connections between the formal aspects of jazz and of literature. Yet, Komunyakaa’s method of cycling through images teases out a link between jazz composition and the fluctuations of a surrealistic unconscious: returning to motifs with intriguing variations. For instance, in “The Hedonist,” Komunyakaa begins with a fantastical narrative, writing, “I pull on my crow mask. / Butterflies & insects rise / in the ether of remembrance” and later modulates to a related but different image: “After eating quail eggs & fish tongues, / I don a snarling dog mask / & pursue a would-be lover / into the hanging garden … & the I enter the labyrinth.” The task is no longer so much to explicate the change of masks to reveal the underlying ‘content,’ but to experience these images as characteristic of the fascinating and alien world Komunyakaa has constructed. His continued attraction to improvisation has a corresponding impulse that seeks more than beautiful and visceral images.
At times, Komunyakaa’s relationship with his African American heritage bubbles up to the surface, often in the middle of poems that seemed to begin with distinctly different subject matter. These comparisons question the political dimensions of poems that often threaten to remain ultimately apolitical, sensual and immersive as they may be. These interrogations, working in the context of the history of slavery and the civil rights movement, radiate deep pain and an effort to speak honestly. These conflicts are perhaps the largest stage for Komunyakaa’s visceral style: the dense images come first, and then Komunyakaa feels his way toward the source of his emotion.
Only occasionally does the author’s threading of registers falter, usually when Komunyakaa attempts to inject the sheen of the brand-new, as when he refers to “your damn blogosphere” in “Dangerousness.” The work is already so complex and multivalent that the appeal to contemporary relevancy seems forced from time to time, as does the occasional insistence on strong markers of the vernacular, like the “You know” and “Yes, that’s right” that pepper a section of “Ten or Eleven Disguises.” However, for the most part it is a testament to Komunyakaa’s skill that everything is sutured together with so few stitches showing.
This stitching together, referred to as a poem’s “tone” or “voice,” is one of the most commonly used—and least defined—terms in poetry. Still, these terms are indispensable here. Komunyakaa’s poetry speaks with authority (or at the very least with a broad assurance of his place). This voice, nearly oracular in its ability to conjure exquisite figures onto the blank page, gains power through its very spontaneity. In “When Eyes Are On Me,” Komunyakaa begins with the assertion of identity, writing, “I am a scrappy old lion … I walk big shouldered, my head raised / proudly. I smell the blood of a king. / The citizens can see only a minotaur in a maze. / I know more than a lion should know.” The poet’s position of privileged knowledge is brazenly stated, making it clear (but enticing) that the reader is at the mercy of the poet’s mutable visions. Anything can be conjured and anything can be withheld, and there is a perverse pleasure in following the dance of Komunyakaa’s material.
There is no question that Komunyakaa’s poetry produces powerful, unpredictable images, but occasionally, one gets the twinge of a feeling that the pieces don’t quite add up. This is the drawback of operating by insinuation: as much as the reader enjoys being teased, he hopes for to be rewarded after his effort. If the answer is always to be withheld, then how high can the stakes really be? The world created is unforgettable, but not totally satisfying. Komunyakaa’s entertaining, enigmatic poems remain unfulfilled in their reading, always leaving something extra on the other side.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Damage is the natural condition of American culture and society in the fiction of David Foster Wallace. This damage takes manifold and pervasive forms, running the gamut between that of the purely physical, in violence and deformity, to that of the purely mental, in trauma and insanity. The most memorable of Wallace’s characters—that is to say, the most human—are often afflicted with more than their share of one or the other, and at least a little of both.
Such is the lot of protagonists and bit players alike in “The Pale King,” the manuscript assembled from drafts of Wallace’s last major effort before his suicide in September 2008. Among his admirers, there is an impulse—difficult to resist—to conflate the personal tragedy of Wallace’s death with the tragedies of the profoundly damaged people who inhabit his fiction, and more generally with the failure to fulfill the tremendous ambitions of what would have been his third novel had he lived to complete it. It’s unfortunate that many of the manuscript’s earliest reviewers were unable to stifle this jerk of the critical knee—which Wallace himself would doubtless have dismissed—leaving much of the quality of “The Pale King” unexamined. It’s a matter of fact that Wallace’s life and his relationship to the writing process informed his work. But rehashing this fact pays mere lip service to what makes the manuscript a unique and formidable artistic achievement in its own right, and to what made Wallace himself the voice the loss from which American literature has still not recovered.
15 years after the release of his sprawling masterpiece “Infinite Jest,” Wallace’s aesthetic—a metaphysical hunger sheathed in self-referential flourishes of both high- and low-brows varieties—has influenced a generation of writers who themselves now dominate the cultural moment in English-language prose, dubbed ‘hysterical realists’ by pejorative and endearing turns each. Perhaps it’s a queasiness with this shift from revolution to establishment, a chafing at the constraints of the style with which he had become synonymous that prompts some of his most striking substantive and stylistic gambits in “The Pale King.”
Much of the 500-page-plus bulk of the manuscript deals with the intake of several rote returns examiners at the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) Regional Examination Center (REC) in Peoria, Ill. in and around 1985. Each of these new examiners, or ‘wigglers’—Wallace’s fictional shorthand for the myriad terminology and protocol of IRS bureaucracy testifies to the intensity of his research and helps these references pass humorously and smoothly on the page—demonstrates an iteration of the kind of damage that saturates Wallace’s America, scars whose circumstances are as banal as they are harrowing. Recounting a story from wiggler Toni Ware’s youth too horrifying and bizarre to repeat here, a coworker reflects, “So do not mess with this girl; this girl is damaged goods.” But this last phrase is applicable to most everyone who passes beneath the absurdly-decorated façade of the Peoria REC: David Cusk is afflicted with a pathological sweating disorder, the knowledge and heightened awareness of which only makes these attacks more frequent and severe; Meredith Rand is a recovering cutter; David Wallace—more on this later—is stricken with disfiguring facial acne. Beyond supplying a source of comic or tragic tension, the damage that permeates and even cripples these individuals has the effect of a general humbling or making low: it democratizes. Poised as they are between grotesquerie and personhood, the characters of “The Pale King” are therefore open to the possibility of redemption. “We are all of us brothers,” the narrator announces on the first page, without a soul in sight, and it has the air of benediction in that moment. But what’s left of the novel to come finds these souls, seemingly condemned to a waking life of Sisyphean drudgery, wrestling with these words and what it means for all of us if they’re true.
From what we have of “The Pale King,” it eems Wallace intended the novel to provide a model for this redemption in and of itself. Much of the manuscript reads as a response to the existential negativity of “Infinite Jest,” whose dystopian vision of America as caught in a narco-consumerist mise en abyme stands in stark contrast to the book’s moments of affirmation. Inside a darkened elevator, a group of Service administrators engage in a sort of philosophical dialogue, heady with the history of government and ethics in America, and a narrative of the lapse of moral society. If this lapse is where we find ourselves now, “The Pale King” would call us to make accounts—both to take responsibility for our lives, and to make manifest from its chaos some kind of meaningful order. Such is the epiphany in ‘Irrelevant’ Chris Vogle’s 100-page monologue, whose story of how he found the service has all the trappings of a religious conversion. The prism of irony that shapes its telling notwithstanding, the voice of Vogle’s evangelist hits with strange conviction: “You have wondered, perhaps, why all real accountants wear hats? The are today’s cowboys. As will you be. Riding the American range. Riding herd on the unending torrents of financial data... You deal in facts, gentlemen, for which there has been a market since man first crept from the primeval slurry. It is you—tell them what. Who ride, man the walls, define the pie, serve.” The model here, of a frontier of meaning mapped across a landscape of static chatter, evokes Heidegger’s existentialism both more openly and more uprightly than that of Alcoholics Anonymous in “Infinite Jest.” That model’s fulcrum is the ability to choose one’s patterns of attention—an ability that certain sections actively undermine even as they might lecture on the matter. Vogle’s call to the Service prevails over a life up to that point of what he calls nihilism. In “The Pale King,” it isn’t simply the drunks and the junkies that must aspire to a living grace: it’s the whole brotherhood of humanity.
As if the religious overtones weren’t strong enough—Vogle’s orator, he says, is a Jesuit accounting professor—the finest moment in all of “The Pale King” takes the form of modern Christian tribulation. We find Lane Dean Jr., a future wiggler and devout Roman Catholic, sitting in a park meditating on the kind of dilemma for which literature was made: deciding the future of an unborn child. What’s so remarkable about this section in the manuscript, and in his corpus generally, is the sincerity and the sympathy with which Wallace—a secular writer if there ever was one—illuminates this crisis. “What would even Jesus do? For it was just now he felt her two small strong soft hands on his, to turn him. What if he is just afraid, if the truth is no more than this, and if what to pray for is not even love but simple courage, to meet both her eyes as she says it and trust his heart?” Sections like these—of which there are only a handful—veritably shake with the clarity and sheer, uncomplicated joy of the represented truth. Lane Dean, like Don Gately before him, is the anti-neutoric; the hero upon whose shoulders the most unspeakable burdens will not falter because his is the fortitude, not of the mind, but of the spirit. It’s easy to see, in Dean, Wallace feeling through the same radical choice that Leo Tolstoy posits through Levin in the coda of “Anna Karenina”—a way outside the self-defeating logic of the existential circuit, towards something whole and permanent and perfect. It’s in the values that contemporary secularism and moral pluralism eschew—where, for once, there is a right decision and a wrong one—that Wallace seems, if only for an instant amidst the vast noise of the novel, to place his store. Later, in at his desk in Exams, as the unwavering monotony washes over him like waves upon the peaceful beach he cannot quite visualize, the image of his infant son is the one to which he clings for meaning and for sanity. How much of this positivity would have remained unchecked, how much of this exposition would have remained unqualified, had Wallace lived to see the novel through, however, is an unanswerable question.
The novel’s ostensive plot—most of which never materialized—would seem to take a direct interest in these moral stakes. Framed as a nonfiction memoir by a fictionalized David Wallace, the narrator breaks in not infrequently—in a patently Nabokovian device executed with sickening faithfulness, as if to cast a pall across that genre which his writing once invigorated—to explain the Service policy paradigm-shift known as the ‘Spackman Initiative’ which took place during his brief employ at the Peoria REC. Simply put, the Initiative marks the turn from the model of the IRS as simply a tax-collecting service to one of a for-profit corporation; from assuring general compliance to pursuing only the most profitable audits. What Wallace casts as a sort of recession from the Service’s civic responsibility into a state of moral ambivalence would be, in a completed version of “The Pale King,” the novel’s eminent crisis. The Initiative’s coincidence with the Reagan Era and the earliest nascence of the Information Age is, as it were, no coincidence. If “Infinite Jest” is the future of the inhabitants of “The Pale King,” then by now the damage has gone unchecked by too many for too long. From where we sit, the heroic accountant is already extinct.
That, in spite of its circumstances, “The Pale King” accomplishes all this, speaks volumes not only to its authors unsurpassed talent and to his obsessive perfectionism. A great novel, by any measure, is here stillborn in the manuscript. Whether that manuscript represents the aesthetic metamorphosis for which Wallace searched so relentlessly is another matter. The “Notes and Asides” section included by Wallace’s editor, Michael Pietsch (who also writes the foreward) contains broad sketches for the novel’s machinations that, in its present form, “The Pale King” never produces. As a fundamentally separate critical case from that of a complete novel, the manuscript is a fascinating artifact in its own right. The book presents a rare opportunity to peer inside the mechanisms of unique and brilliant literary mind. An artist who put honesty before any pretension, Wallace nevertheless admitted publicly to agonizing over the preparation of his writing. The circumspection and transparency with which Pietsch, along with Wallace’s widow Karen Green and his agent Bonnie Nadell, has patched together a coherent book should serve as a model for the treatment of posthumous works generally: one that respects the dignity of the deceased as well as the right of the reader to their work. Their efforts—heroism of a different form altogether—have born precious if bitter fruit: how many wonderful books like this one would we trade to get back what we’ve lost.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“It was the looks on my blockmates’ faces as they saw me, because they did not know,” says Catherine D. Cook ’12. “I hadn’t told them. They walked up to me and just burst out laughing because I had a bandana on my head, face paint on, [and was] making balloons.” Cook, who ends every statement with a laugh, was no closet clown; she simply had never mentioned her pastime to friends.
Fortunately for Cook, her friends’ laughter was borne out of affection. “I think you just don’t expect your roommate [to sculpt with] balloons … They all grabbed each other and were like, ‘Come look! You have to see this!’”
Embarrassment or no, clowns cannot help but spread happiness. On campus, members of the Class Clowns like Cook twist balloon animals and paint faces for charity. Though professional clowns around Boston work for pay, the philosophical justification for their clowning is equally the delight it may bring about in a viewer. This commitment to entertainment is also a burden, however, as it governs the logistical and business interactions that make up much of a clown’s job. Regardless of the different forms clowning takes, its goal remains constant—to produce a smile.
BALLOON ECOLOGY
For Julie M. Zauzmer ’13, a Crimson news writer and blog exec, the process of clowning is joyful in its means and ends. She is the founder and head of Class Clowns, which practices clowning as a charitable service. Zauzmer says the she started making balloon animals when she was eight years old. “I can definitely remember the first time I got a balloon animal,” Zauzmer says, “coming home and taking it apart, and trying and trying to put it back together again until it popped.”
“I’ve always loved balloons. I think on a very tactile, little-kid level, I’ve never got past it,” she says. “Every single time I make the balloon, even if I’ve made the same animal hundreds and hundreds of times before, I’ll still be sort of, ‘how’d it turn into that?’” For Zauzmer, whose clown moniker is Zippy, clowning is an end in itself. Her production of balloon animals conjures in her the very feelings of wonderment she seeks to produce in others. Zauzmer remembers standing in line at carnivals—twice the age of everyone else—still fascinated by how clowns would produce their squeaky creations.
Balloon animals are a large part of Class Clowns’ output and the majority of their expenses. The array of configurations that Class Clown members can construct is massive—teddy bears, bicycles, and functioning dresses comprised of 50 different balloons. “I really like making the ladybugs because you can wear them as bracelets,” says Cook. Penguins, on the other hand, can be frustrating. “There are three balloons involved, and so when one pops you have to start all over again.”
However, the Class Clowns see their appreciation for balloons as fundamentally connected to a sentimental basis. This past Valentine’s Day, they received requests for 170 balloongrams—personally delivered balloon animals—the profits of which they used to buy more supplies. “It’s not an ordinary Valentine’s Day gift, but it’s something that says that someone put a lot of thought into you as a person, and they knew that you would like something quirky like a balloon,” Cook says. The very peculiarity of clowning products, then, is itself a tool in its appeal, as the unexpected nature of a balloon animal gift contributes to its charm.
As such, Zauzmer and Cook see clowning as an interactive practice. “You can’t clown in a room on your own,” Zauzmer says. Instead, the point is the effect clowning produces on others. “The entire purpose is to make people happy,” offers Zauzmer. In visiting children with behavioral issues or special needs, Class Clowns intends to bring this happiness to the people who need it most. “When you know what you’re doing is sort of making people smile you sort of think ‘okay, who needs smiles?’ and it’s obvious that there are a bunch of groups out there that you can go to,” Zauzmer says. “And it’s not just little kids, elderly people really love clowning too.”
In their charitable conception of clowning, Class Clowns believes that it is not a niche form but a practice that offers the opportunity to cheer the world. Most surprising about this notion is the idea that clowning does not present any restrictions on age. “The people in the middle crowd [of age] think they’re too cool for balloons, and they’re not. And it’s the best feeling when you get them to recognize that they’re not,” Zauzmer says. This recognition confirms for Class Clowns the universal appeal of clowning, which represents the form’s highest level of potential.
Fittingly, Cook talks about the positive effect of clowning in universal terms: “I have never seen someone’s face light up like when you ask them if they want a balloon hat.”
CLOWNING “THE HARD WAY”
For many professional clowns, the wide appeal of clowning and the happiness it brings are also fundamental to their appreciation of their work. However, professional clowning presents financial and organizational challenges that the Class Clowns does not have to confront. For Jack Lepiarz, a traveling performer during his childhood and a former student at Emerson College, the idea that clowning can break down barriers comes from family tradition. “I think part of that is originally what made my father want to be a clown,” Lepiarz recalls. “He said he wanted to be able to entertain anyone. He wanted to be able to entertain a peasant in Colombia or, you know, the New York elite. He wanted to have a show that was translatable, that could entertain anyone.”
Though professional clown David Holzman, who has been in the game for nearly 20 years under the title Davey the Clown, says that “99% of my work is for children,” he also has worked at a handful of completely unexpected events—including a bachelor party. “I specifically told the guy what I did, and that I thought it might not be to interesting for some people at the bachelor party, but he said his brother … didn’t want adult entertainment … It actually worked out really well. They were all doctors, mostly working at [Massachusetts General Hospital] and some from out of town, but they were all, you know, very wholesome people.”
While these cross-cutting cleavages appear intrinsic to all forms of clowning, professional clowns confront business roadblocks unknown to charity organizations. “I think maybe a lot of people think that I do this on the side,” Holzman says. “That maybe I have another job and I just fill in a little bit on weekends by doing this. I practice every day, about one skill or another, four hours. And I wouldn’t have this kind of time if I had another job.” Clowning for Holzman is not the hobby it is for Zauzmer but rather a serious and consuming enterprise.
Professional juggler Jennifer Thompson Oberhauser finds the endless logistical requirements of clowning exhausting. “I would love the privilege of working in the marketing and promo department of my company ... I would love the privilege of being the talent and the performing artist for my company,” Thompson Oberhauser says. “But I don’t have any of those privileges—I get to do them all. The challenge is to make that not overwhelming and to balance that with my personal life.” As with many clowns, Thompson Oberhauser does not have substantial career support from a large institution and must make her reputation and find clients on her own.
Holzman embraces these professional difficulties. “One of things I like about clowning is that I like to take the path less taken,” he says. “I like to do things the hard way, you could say. It’s a constant challenge to make a living this way.”
SMILING THROUGH
Maybe the chief challenge of clowning is the necessity to stay constantly in character. “You have to both be entertaining and businesslike at the same time, and it’s a difficult balancing act,” Holzman says. “You can’t play the fool and be a fool … I have to think of an entertaining way to say, ‘no, I can’t be there two days,’ or else I’m not funny!” When having to balance humor and business, Holzman opines, “It’s a little ironic and a little frustrating at times.” The lines between performance, real-life personality, and livelihood are blurred such that Holzman is regularly tasked with trying to find humor in everyday decisions, including the uncomfortable ones that occur outside of clowning itself.
It may be the lack of professional imperative that allows Zauzmer to see these challenges as wholly rewarding. “There’s always irritating things that happen that you have to deal with as if it’s funny, as if it’s no big deal, and then it’s funny,” Zauzmer says. “That’s your job: to make it become funny. All those little irritating things, you have to smile through them. Honestly it makes it more fun for you, because after a while you forget you’re faking it.” It is as if smiling through issues is another part of Zauzmer’s clowning act, as she makes the irritating aspects of the job another moment of performance.
Like Zauzmer, Lepiarz enjoys the process of acting in character even when his internal state may diverge from it completely. “I’ve always found it easier to go into performing if I am in a bad mood,” Lepiarz says. “When you’re performing you’re becoming such a different character. The way I’ve always looked at it is that it’s something I use as an anchor, [channeling] that energy into a more goofy or wacky character.”
SYMBIOTIC STUNTS
Ultimately, clowns see this act of performance as the motivating factor behind their work. “The performing itself is the privilege and the chaos,” Thompson Oberhauser says. “By doing it professionally, you have the opportunity to really develop your craft and build your life around being able to deliver the performances.”
Max A. Binder ’09, who grew up performing in the circus with his parents and who could be seen walking on stilts for Adams House during Housing Day, sees moments of crowd interaction as themselves determining the type and enjoyment of performance. “There’s nothing really like feeding off a crowd’s energy and what they like and don’t like. You milk that for all it’s worth.” Clowning, therefore, is dynamic by nature, as every performance will differ due to its audience’s reactions.
“I have a set script that I stick to, but every show is different because audiences are different,” Lepiarz says. “The audience is the best part of the show because the audience is what keeps the show fresh for me so I’m not just an automaton doing the same thing over and over again.”
What may make clowning unique is its reliance on an audience. If spectators are not enjoying themselves, then neither can the performer. The relationship between clown and viewer, then, is symbiotic, and clowning is the product of this collaboration.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a college that prides itself on admitting the best and brightest, the presence of athletes with academic records that are below the College average is frequently a point of contention. Some see it as unfair that the College chooses to admit students who are talented runners, rowers, or hockey players but who have weaker academic records than many rejected applicants.
But though Harvard will always be first and foremost an academic institution, it also prides itself on giving its undergraduates more than just access to excellent professors and engaging classes. Having a thriving athletic program is an important part of the undergraduate experience, both for the athletes and for those who support them.
Harvard’s athletic department has made an effort to both field competitive teams and to create a large and supportive fan base. The University’s efforts have paid off in demonstrating Harvard’s widespread athletic excellence—in the last four years, Harvard has won one national team championship, four individual national titles, and 19 Ivy titles across 15 different sports.
More importantly, on a campus that is increasingly socially fragmented, sports are the one thing that brings us all together. The stadium staff doesn’t care if you made it through the punch process or if you’ve spent every Saturday night studying—sports games are one of the few social events where a Harvard ID is really all you need to belong.
In the last four years, night games have become an important part of the social calendar. Football’s annual game under the lights, along with marquee matchups with nationally-ranked opponents in men’s soccer and lacrosse, bring thousands of students across the river in support of their peers. These games have been just as beneficial for the teams playing in them as for the students who watch them—Harvard squads are 5-1 in such contests across football, men’s soccer, and men’s lacrosse. A habit of athletic excellence creates a positive feedback loop, causing even more fans to support Harvard’s teams and further adding to the feeling of solidarity that athletics events create.
Remarkably, the Department of Athletics has been yielding such success with a budget that ranked seventh out of the eight Ivy League schools in size last academic year. Harvard fields more varsity teams than any school in the country, and last year it managed to support them all with a budget of $18 million—just half of what Yale spent over the same time frame. Even with this limited budget, Harvard has still managed to hire and retain high-caliber coaches such as Tommy Amaker, who took just four years to turn a perennially struggling men’s basketball program into a first-time Ivy League championship team. For Amaker and similarly high-caliber coaches like football’s Tim Murphy and women’s hockey’s Katey Stone, both of whom have more than 15 years of service at Harvard, there is something special about finding athletic success at a school that is so academically driven.
Their selling point is that at Harvard, you can get pretty close to having it all. An athlete here gets the chance to learn both from challenging academic classes and from the rigors of Division I athletics. It takes a special prospective student to recognize this—and to possibly forego a full scholarship at another school to come and play a sport at a school that will always ask him or her to be a student first.
We all came to Harvard with different talents, but once we get here, we’re held to the exact same standards. Whether you’re an athlete, a superfan, or have never made it across the river, your college experience has been impacted in one way or another by students who may never have thought that Harvard was a possibility without the recruitment and support of the athletic department. Academics may always come first at a university like this, but we ought to appreciate the unique contributions that athletes make to the Harvard community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I graduated from Harvard, it never occurred to me that eight years (and one Masters degree from Yale) later, I’d be desperately trying—throat tightening, palms sweating, will to live shrinking—to solve a tough question on the SAT. Even worse, I was expected to know the answer; I was the SAT tutor, after all. My student, whose parents were paying two hundred and fifty dollars an hour for my services, stared at me expectantly. There was only one thing to do: Smile mysteriously, assign the problem as “extra credit homework,” go home, and check the back of the book.
The deeper question that was gnawed at me was both simpler and more intractable: What in the world was I doing? I had degrees from Harvard and Yale (okay, they were in English and Acting, but still) and here I was supplementing my totally rational plan to become a massive star of stage and screen by working for an elite New York tutoring company, employed by wealthy parents, hoping to give their child an edge. (As a friend said, “They’re rich and desperate. Make the most of it!”)
After I raised my students’ SAT scores, I was expected to help with their college applications, coaching them on topics for personal statements (Golf? My cat? The color green?) and then meticulously editing their essays into something presentable. When I told a worried parent that I would be happy to provide young Johnny with essay “suggestions,” she looked at me, brows knit: “Honestly, I think Johnny needs more than just suggestions. He needs someone to sit there with him and get the words out. Not write it for him, of course.” Oh no, of course not.
I felt torn. On the one hand, after you’ve spent four hours with a recalcitrant high school senior, quizzing him in the hope of finding something—anything—that you can use as the basis for his personal statement, you pretty much hate him. On the other, I felt great sympathy for my students. I’m sure a handful of next year’s Harvard freshman class split the atom in pre-kindergarten, but for most of us, the prospect of summing up who we are with one brilliantly crafted piece of prose is daunting, to say the least.
I myself shuddered at the thought. But then again, I was living in my parents’ basement and stealing their food and toilet paper. So I began to care obsessively about my students’ applications, staying up late proofreading attempts to perfectly describe “When I lived in Brazil,” or “The Museum Trip That Changed My Life.” Before long I found myself switching out vocabulary words to make the prose more impressive, cleaning up a paragraph, suggesting a new ending, or even restructuring the entire essay.
Admissions committees are—or should be—well aware of the leg up that rich kids have in the application process. But the more I coached and tutored, the more I wondered whether the so-called advantages I was providing might actually be hurting more than helping. Was it really an advantage to spend Saturdays drilling test taking strategies that (unless you become an SAT tutor) have pretty much zero relevance to your future life? And what would it feel like to be admitted to the college of your dreams on the basis of an application that had been managed, tweaked and supervised by somebody else?
Perhaps no amount of tutoring can make up for the feeling of not having truly earned one’s admission. “Gaming the system” sounds a lot like a euphemism for cheating, and too much coddling and coaching may do irrevocable damage to a young person’s budding sense of integrity. Now I see that the most valuable gift I could have given my students would have been to let them succeed or fail on their own terms, maybe even learning that what seems like failure can be success in disguise.
As I wrestled with my own feelings of failure—Harvard grad turned mediocre tutor and night-time toilet paper bandit—I began, slowly, to write about it. “Johnny’s” mom’s words, along with those of other parents and students, slowly worked their way into scenes, and ultimately became my first full-length play, IN, which tells the story of a high school senior and his mother, who is desperate that he get into Harvard.
They hire a tutor, Sara, a slightly lost and miserable Harvard grad (where did I get that idea?), who learns over the course of the play to mistrust simplistic visions of success and failure, ultimately finding the strength to stand up for what’s true. Writing that play led to my first playwriting agent, and then more plays, screenplays and television work—and suddenly I had a career as a writer. I am proud to report that it’s been a very long time since I stole a roll of toilet paper and, while I still am stumped by problems all the time, none of them are from the SAT.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is one of the enduring oddities of American politics that one of the two major parties has committed itself to a policy agenda that helps a vanishingly small portion of the population at the expense of the rest. How could the majority party in the House propose a budget ending Medicare—one of the most popular and effective programs in American history? How could they force a budget compromise that includes significant cuts to education and health spending for the middle class?
Part of the problem, as Nobel laureate economist Joseph E. Stiglitz points out in a new Vanity Fair piece, is demographic. If policymakers support policies that help the top one percent of earners at the expense of the rest of the country, couldn’t part of the reason be that those policymakers themselves are part of the same elite they’re helping? More or less every member of Congress is a top earner upon election, funds his or her campaign with the donations of top earners, and takes a high-salary gig at a lobbying firm or elsewhere upon retirement. Same goes for policy aides in Congress and the White House.
The traditional way to combat this problem is through campaign finance reform. However, the past forty years of reform attempts at a federal level haven’t shown much improvement. There is some evidence to suggest that public funding for elections can reduce the time candidates spend interacting with wealthy donors and increase the time they spend with voters. That said, the programs that work use a “matching funds” approach that the Supreme Court looks set to rule unconstitutional.
This isn’t to say that there couldn’t exist some other possible system that would reduce candidate dependence on donors and withstand judicial scrutiny. But it does suggest that another approach to tackling the problem may be worth pursuing as well. Let me suggest an unorthodox approach: Make voting mandatory.
One reason why higher economic classes’ interests are so overrepresented in government is that rich people vote at disproportionately high rates, and poor people vote at disproportionately low rates. For example, in 2008, people making over $100,000 a year represented 20.5 percent of the population, but 26 percent of the voting population. By contrast, people making under $30,000 a year made up 30.2 percent of the population but a mere 18 percent of voters.
Some might think any increased influence on the part of the rich due to higher voting rates is justified. It was the poor’s choice not to vote, the argument would go, so why shouldn’t they live with the consequences? Putting aside the questionable morality of allowing such significant harm to befall someone due to a single choice, lower voting rates among the poor aren’t just a result of choice.
Voting is expensive. It involves taking time off work, which, if one’s employer isn’t flexible enough to allow paid voting breaks, lower-income people may not be able to afford missing. Voting also involves transportation costs, which, while trivial for wealthier individuals, impose a real cost for others. There are steps the government could take to make it less costly, such as scheduling election days on weekends, setting them as national holidays for which employers must give the day off, or making public transit free during voting hours. But we could also raise the cost of not voting, most effectively by banning it.
We wouldn’t be the first developed democracy to adopt compulsory voting. Belgium and, most notably, Australia both have enforced criminal penalties for not voting. Their systems work fairly well and Australia’s has succeeded in increasing lower and working class participation in politics. Most political scientists believe that compulsory voting adds a few percentage points of support to left-leaning parties, with one study finding it reduced support for conservative parties by 5 percent in the 1996 Australian federal election. Similarly, some back-of-the-envelope math suggests that if all income groups voted in proportion to their percentage of the population in the 2008 presidential election, Barack Obama would have beaten John McCain by an even wider margin.
Conservatives could, thus, dismiss compulsory voting as a liberal power grab. But if it’s a power grab, it’s a power grab on behalf of people currently underrepresented in our politics, with the goal of giving all Americans an equal say. Traditionally, we call that kind of system “democracy”, and most people are rather fond of it.
Compulsory voting won’t do enough to combat high earners’ overrepresentation in our politics. Wealthy individuals will still make up most of our elected and appointed government officials, and their campaign dollars will still increase their influence in legislative debates. Mandatory voting is only a small step toward a fairer politics, but it’s a step nonetheless.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On January 18, sociologists Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa released a book entitled Academically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses which essentially accuses the current American collegiate environment of not nurturing the same level of reasoning skills in its students as it once did. These two sociologists conclude that more than a third of American college seniors are no better at crucial types of writing and reasoning tasks than they were in their first semester of college. Already, the book has elicited a great deal of discussion in academic circles, being the subject of a column by Bob Herbert in The New York Times two weeks ago. Even though we as Harvard students cannot claim to represent a typical American collegiate experience, we still believe that the study appears to sensationalize what is by now a common complaint—that “kids these days” don’t know anything and don’t care about learning. What the book does not emphasize is that students are still learning, even if they do not classify the time they spend learning strictly as “studying.” The book’s methodology does not encompass the ways in which the information age has changed how new generations of students think, communicate, and interact.
First and foremost, on a methodological level, we believe that the conclusions drawn from the book cannot be applied as widely or definitively as its authors intend. Although the strict definition of learning utilized in it is fair, its reliance on the Collegiate Learning Assessment, a standardized test administered to incoming freshmen and graduating seniors, as an indicator for academic development in college is undue and problematic. As an exam, the CLA has two components: Performance Tasks and Analytic Writing Tasks. Performance Tasks “ask students to engage in a ‘real-life’ activity (such as preparing a memo or policy recommendation), that requires reviewing or evaluating several documents.” Analytic Writing Tasks are composed of sections that ask students to “Make-an-Argument” and “Critique-an-Argument.” A comparison of these components between freshman year and senior year is meant to provide a definitive assessment of how much a student has learned during his or her four years in college.
We question the ability of such an exam to accurately represent the intellectual gains that students make during college, especially given that the administrators of the exam admit that “The CLA does not control for self-reported student effort.” Admittedly, they do use students’ previous SAT/ACT scores as a control, but when it comes to evaluating colleges, the CLA administrators shift blame onto the institutions whose students they survey: “In addition, higher education institutions do and should instill in their students the habit of devoting due effort to any task that they agree to undertake, whether that be taking a course, engaging in volunteer work, or participating in an assessment because their college asked them to do so… In that sense, student willingness to perform well on the CLA is one indicator of institutional impact.”  While such normative ideas can be charming, realistically speaking, one cannot expect even the most motivated and benevolent college senior to necessarily strive to represent him or herself, let alone the alma mater, accurately on a test that has relatively little clout on a public scale.
Departing from a technical critique, however, we believe that the greatest problem of the book lies in its insufficiency in accounting for students’ different learning style in the 21st century. The book is guilty of more than generalization when it comes to learning, which is a highly individualized and unique process. What this book does not reflect is that in the information age, students are responsible for much more information than previous generations have been. While we recognize that these sociologists consider growth in “critical thinking, complex reasoning, and writing skills over time,” the fact remains that the CLA does not measure how much tangible knowledge students have acquired over their time in college. Even if the CLA accurately reflected the degree to which students acquire measurable liberal arts skills, it does not account for the intellectual growth students gain from reading news articles, debating with peers, holding jobs, or any number of activities in which students engage informally.
To be sure, we understand that these sociologists have caught onto a trend of “getting by” that is all too frequent on college campuses. However, their study comes across as nothing short of damning of a social and academic environment that is undeniably formative for every single college student in one way or another. College is a diverse environment full of a dazzling spectrum of people and opportunities that expand the horizons of its students in ways they could have only imagined at home. We believe it superfluous, therefore, to question the motives to send high school graduates to college, for different generations learn in different ways. There is much intellectual growth that happens on campus that cannot be measured, a tantalizing datum that sociologists would do well to accept might be unreachable.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Faculty panels during Visitas, Harvard’s program for prospective freshmen that ended yesterday, have been retooled to resemble “Harvard Thinks Big,” which the director of Visitas hopes has made them “more dynamic and less dry.”
The panels, which formerly consisted of faculty members discussing their fields more broadly and commenting on their students’ academic experiences, instead took a format akin to the forum in which invited Harvard faculty discuss a particular issue or idea.
Faculty members at the arts and humanities panel were invited to answer the question “If you could require every person to study one piece of work, what would it be and why?”
At the sciences panel, faculty members explored the significance of stem cell research; and professors in the social sciences discussed how we can avoid another financial crisis.
At these panels, faculty members, rather than discussing the merits of their fields as in years past, instead offered specific ideas and arguments.
For example, Economics Associate Professor Efraim Benmelech suggested at the social sciences panel that rather than attempting altogether to evade financial crises—which he said were oftentimes inevitable corollaries to financial innovation—prevention should take into consideration the costs of regulation.
The change to a Harvard Thinks Big-style format was meant to make the panels more entertaining to visiting students, according to Visitas organizers.
“They will be more dynamic and less dry than they have been in the past,” said Visiting Program Director Valerie A. Beilenson ’07.
Many prefrosh praised the new style.
Jacqueline Lin, a prospective student, said that the panels allow prefrosh to “get a taste for what courses will be like and what will be taught.” She said she found that listening to professors engage intellectually is “more helpful” than informational panels that provide broad descriptions of academic disciplines or concentration requirements.
But other students found the questions tackled by professors at the faculty panels too specific and not necessarily relevant to the purpose of a college visiting weekend.
Prefrosh Ewan Foster said that the organizers of Visitas should “go back to the old way” because prospective freshman “have not begun to study” the questions tackled by professors at the panels.
But prefrosh Jonathan A. Taratuta said that the faculty panels’ new format allows students to better understand “what a discipline itself is like and the kind of intellectual environment that Harvard offers.”
The panels “parallel discussions I would have if I come to Harvard,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If done correctly, porn need not be degrading to women but can be an educational experience that allows individuals to interact with their sexuality in a productive way, sexologist Carol Queen said yesterday.
Queen—the owner of Boston sex shop, Good Vibrations—hosted a discussion yesterday at the Law School on the issue of creating positive porn and respecting LGBTQ and women’s rights in the porn industry.
Queen defined positive porn as “giving people an alternative way to think about eroticism”—that is, showing realistic people having realistic sex as opposed to the stylized people and scenarios characteristic of mainstream porn. The inclusion of a diversity of body types; realistic, educational sex scenes; and the respect for the rights of the actors are all crucial aspects of positive porn, Queen said.
By contrast, the typical lead in the porn industry, Queen suggested, is the blonde, skinny actress with large breasts, which gives the impression that these are the only people worthy of sexual encounters.
“If everyone had the opportunity to see themselves as erotic, then that would be a very amazing thing,” Queen said.
She also noted the role porn has played in informing the public on sexual scenarios they cannot always act out.
“Yours is not the first generation to have turned to porn to get their questions answered,” Queen stated. If done correctly, to include facts and informational perspectives, as opposed to just entertainment and arousal, the porn industry can begin answering these questions, Queen said. Most porn films, Queen complained, are “not enhancing to anyone—the viewer, the people in it—and degrade their notion of sexuality”
“Porn is a very contested issue in feminism and law,” said Law School student and Harvard Law Students for Reproductive Justice (HLSRJ) member Evelyn M. Atkinson. “One major critique is that much of mainstream porn shows violence against or subordination of women. So our idea was to ask, is all porn oppressive this way?”
Queen, who hosted the popular female orgasm seminar last Friday, was brought to Harvard by HLSRJ and Lambda, Harvard Law School’s LGBTQ group. The event was part of HLSRJ’s Sex Week, which seeks to provide the campus with a week of open dialogue on fun and healthy sex.
“I think the event was unique and productive,” said first year Law School student and fellow HLSRJ member Kandis B. Wood. “I’m looking forward to continuing the discussion about positive porn and its correlated issues next year.”

Divya K. Narendra ’04, featured in “The Social Network” alongside the Winklevoss twins as they sued the founder of Facebook, emphasized the importance of perseverance at a conference at Harvard Medical School last Saturday.
Narendra, who created a site where investors can share financial recommendations, encouraged audience members to take risks even if they felt apprehensive about their relative inexperience.
“You don’t have a lot of experience, but you have big ideas. So convincing yourself it’s time to launch a business can be daunting,” he said. “But I think the end result is worth the risk.”
Still, when asked if he had any regrets from college, he had one to name: “I wish I was a programmer.”
The Negotiation and Leadership Conference, at which Narendra spoke, held by the Harvard Extension Service and Leadership Society, a group that made headlines for holding a conference earlier this month featuring speakers who had made alleged Islamophobic and homophobic remarks.
Saturday’s conference sought to discuss what—beyond book smarts—it takes to make a great leader.
“Academic intelligence offers little to no preparation for the vicissitudes of life,” said Nigel Clarke, a panelist at the conference and the CEO of Facey Commodity Company, a distribution company based in Jamaica.
Andre E. Bisasor, the chair of the conference, echoed Clarke’s remarks.
“In an academic environment, we tend to look at IQ as a primary way to predict success. So when you look at social and emotional intelligence, those are elements that very smart people are sometimes unable to grasp and be successful in leadership,” he said.
Attendees expressed satisfaction with the conference, which featured two panels focusing on spiritual, emotional, and social intelligence and one on young, emerging entrepreneurs.
“I’m actually working on some charity projects right now, where you need to be able to negotiate, to convince people that you are doing something worthwhile for the community,” said Gopi Manchineella, who attended the conference.
Harvard Extension Student Association President Philip Harding called the conference “fantastic.”
“The emerging leaders panel hits home to where I am right now,” he said.

Former Justice Minister of Lebanon Ibrahim Najjar said that the heavy influence of religious ideals in his country makes it difficult to craft secular laws that simultaneously satisfy both Muslims and Christians, in a lecture at Harvard Law School yesterday.
In his remarks, Najjar discussed the challenges and nuances of balancing Islamic Shariah law, Christian tenets, and civil law.
For example, Najjar cited his attempts to improve inheritance rights of illegitimate children during his time as justice minister.
Although he said he was eventually able to convince Islamic communities that the initiative was in the spirit of Shariah law, he continued to face opposition from Christian communities, which resulted in the failure of the legislation.
Throughout the lecture, Najjar alluded to Muslim society’s sometimes strict, sometimes flexible interpretation of Shariah law.
More than any other idea, however, Najjar stressed the necessity of cooperation and understanding between people of different religions.
“We have to find common ground not only in a very vague way of thinking, saying, or talking,” he said. “We have to find common ground in practice, in day-to-day life. And law is attuned to organize this ‘living together.’”
In an interview, Najjar said he would support a secular government in Lebanon.
“Religion is important, but citizenship—being Lebanese—is far more important,” he said.
Although Najjar’s lecture focused on the situation in Lebanon and other Middle Eastern countries, he maintained that this discussion is a universally relevant one.
“This lecture was not specifically on Lebanon,” Najjar said. “In fact, the problems I have raised exist all over the world, in the very conflicted world we have today.”
George J. Somi, a graduate student at Harvard’s Center for Middle Eastern Studies (CMES), said he felt Najjar’s efforts to foster a growing secular community are “innovative and encouraging ... for people who want to seek an alternative direction to expressing themselves and living the lives they want to live.”
CMES student Zil Yassine praised Najjar’s cooperative spirit.
“To have somebody who is willing to see beyond this confrontation is definitely something that is needed in the region,” he said.
Najjar’s lecture was the sixth in the  Abd al-Razzaq al-Sanhuri Lecture Series on Legal Interpretation in the Muslim World, hosted by the Law School’s Islamic Legal Studies Program.

Unite Here Local 26, the Boston-area hospitality union which represents Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services workers, has kick-started its contract negotiations with the University, launching the fight for what they deem “sustainable jobs” for dining staff.
The current contract between the workers and the University expires on June 19.
The University and union members have had two meetings to date, which Local 26 President Brian Lang said primarily consisted of each side setting out and explaining its proposals for the new contract.
Lang emphasized the connection between Harvard’s sustainable foods initiative and maintaining good jobs for workers, which he said includes reversing a recent decline in pay for HUHDS staff.
He said that improvements in the various jobs of the dining hall workers would go hand in hand with improvements in Harvard’s sustainable food program.
“In spite of the green agenda, there has been an increase in pre-packaged food,” he said. “That [sustainable] program only works if it is coupled with a program of sustainable jobs—jobs we can continue to raise our families on.”
William P. Whitham ’14, who is a member of the Student Labor Action Movement, said he agreed with Lang’s sentiment.
“In a lot of ways, over the past ten to fifteen years, the quality of the food has actually declined,” Whitham said.
Whitham pointed to a number of specific policies that he said would help Harvard to improve the treatment of its workers while addressing the quality of its dining hall meals. He called for greater job security as well as a living wage and better retirement options for HUHDS employees.
Lang also called on the University to increase the hours of dining hall workers.
“We have to have jobs with enough hours to feed our families,” Lang said.
Lang added that dining hall workers are also requesting a higher level of financial transparency from the University.
“As workers, we feel that [HUHDS] can only work if we have the same information as the administration,” Lang said.
University spokesperson Kevin Galvin wrote in an emailed statement that the administration hopes to work out a contract that is beneficial for all parties involved.
“We are hopeful that an open and constructive dialogue will lead to an agreement that benefits both the Dining Services staff and the rest of the Harvard community,” he wrote.

Led by several Harvard undergraduates, the March for Common Sense passed through Harvard Square yesterday, as part of a 13-mile route that retraced in reverse Paul Revere’s historic ride from Boston to Lexington.
Those participating in the march called for the readjustment of the tax bracket to close corporate loopholes and budget cuts that spare certain government programs.
“We really wanted to bring progressive voices together to essentially restore common sense in Washington,” said Simon M. Thompson ‘14, the logistics coordinator for the march.
Roughly 40 people walked the full distance of the march, dressed in tricorn hats, blowing on vuvuzelas, and chanting “Fight back.”
Coming from Garden Street, the crowd reached Cambridge Common around 1:30 p.m., stopping to hear several speakers give a few brief remarks.
“I’m so proud of all of you for marching these 13 miles and fighting for what’s right for America,” said Cambridge City Councillor Leland Cheung.
Samuel B. Novey ’11, a co-organizer of the event, spoke to an ideological divide between Democrats and Republicans and their respective views on how to approach trillions of dollars in federal budget deficits.
“We think that the top 10 percent have done very well and they’re not paying their share,” Novey said. “If you’re going to make cuts, don’t just make them on the backs of working-class Americans.”
After about 20 minutes, the march continued through Harvard Square and on to Boston.
The march culminated in a rally on the Paul Revere Mall and then proceeded on to Mass. Sen. John F. Kerry’s office.
The marchers asked Kerry to introduce the Fairness in Taxation Act, which would reduce the deficit by raising federal income tax rates on millionaires and billionaires, in the Senate.
Although Kerry’s staffers said that he would not introduce the bill, Novey concluded that the day’s efforts had still been successful.
“We showed our politicians that we’re not just going to accept talk anymore.” Novey said. “I think our message came across loud and clear.
Of the people passing through the park who had stopped to hear what the marchers had to say, several responded positively.
“They touched on a lot of things that I’m concerned about,” said David A. Whelan, a Cambridge resident and clinical instructor in psychology at Harvard Medical School. “I was glad that my two kids got to hear it.”

While Passover is not an official University holiday, Jewish students around campus celebrated the first night of the holy festival with their own seders yesterday.
With the help of Harvard Hillel and the Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services, students hosted 17 different seders—the ritual dinner occurring on the first and second nights of Passover—involving almost 300 undergraduates, according to Director of Student Activities at Hillel Gabriella Soble.
Passover, which started last night, is an eight-day festival commemorating the Exodus of Israelite slaves from ancient Egypt typically celebrated through a ritual meal.
Serving communities ranging from the Quad to the Harvard University Band, and attracting both Jews and non-Jews alike, the student-initiated seders gave undergraduates the chance to celebrate Passover in their own way.
Cabot House resident Seth A. Pearce ’12, who is hosting a seder for the second time in the Quad, said he prefers celebrating Passover with his friends and sharing his family’s traditions.
“It’s an beautiful, open, and inclusive event,” he said.
Aryeh Gold-Parker ’12 said he was excited to be hosting the annual seder for the Harvard University Band in the Lowell House bell tower this year.
“It’s a really fun tradition and it’s something that I would miss here if we didn’t have it,” Gold-Parker said. “I’m glad that even though I can’t be home with my family, I am able to celebrate it here with my close friends.”
Lillian R. Margolin ’11, another seder host, organized an interfaith dinner for her friends that included Jews, Christians, and Muslims on the guest list.
Students said the support of Hillel made organizing the events easier. Hillel offers students everything they need to host a seder—including food, grape juice and wine, a seder plate, and the Haggadot, the script that gives the order for the ritual to be read during the dinner—through a registration process.
“They even give you the actual plates, cups, utensils, and salt for the salt water,” said Pearce.
“Organizing is all you have to do ... Hillel provides the food and the prayer books,” said Gold-Parker.
Hillel will also be offering a wide array of programming for Passover this week, including their own first- and second-night seders, with both traditional and progressive options.
They will also host “Kosher for Passover” study breaks in Adams, Mather, and Thayer, a special “Freedom Shabbat” dinner on Friday presenting narratives of slavery, and a matzoh pizza social on Saturday night featuring a twist on traditional Passover food.

This past Friday, the cast of the 38th annual Harvard Business School Show—an original musical entitled “Somewhere Over the Footbridge”—parodied the life of Harvard MBA candidates in their final show after four days of performances.
A tradition since 1974, when business school student Joe Parrish first created a show comprised of skits mocking life at the Business School, the annual performance has evolved into a multi-act original musical, replete with dance sequences and parodies of contemporary pop songs.
The plot of this year’s show centered on four incoming students of the HBS Class of 2012 as they navigate their way through “Crimsonland” after one of the four poisons their Scorpion Bowl at the Hong Kong Restaurant.
As the show progresses, the audience learns that the mastermind behind the evil plot is Jeffrey Skilling, the HBS graduate and former president of Enron, who is attempting to discredit Dean Nitin Nohria and replace him.
Making their way along the “Crimson Brick Road,” the students, each paralleling one of the original characters from the Wizard of Oz, complete challenges to acquire the three attributes the Business School most values: intellect, courage, and heart.
Michael D. A. Son, the show’s director, said that the behind-the-scenes work, though time-consuming, was just as enjoyable as the show itself.
“It was a huge leadership and management challenge, but I enjoyed myself immensely,” he said. “We harnessed every possible faculty we could: great actors, great musicians, and great designers.”
During the length of the musical, the performers sang and danced to a number of contemporary songs whose lyrics were tweaked to include numerous self-deprecating jokes.
The Oz classic “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” was altered to include the lyrics “Somewhere over the footbridge/Way up high/There’s a land that I heard of/Home of the suit and tie.”
Smriti Mishra, a Business School student in attendance, said that she thought the show was “absolutely phenomenal,” and noted the professional quality of the student-run production.
“The acting, the dancing, the music, the set, the lighting—everything was just awesome. And the choice of songs to parody was perfect,” she said.
Although the theme for next year’s show has yet to be decided, Son said he hopes that it will come together as well as this year’s show.
“The show started as disparate sketches, and it slowly became a Broadway-style musical. Hopefully we can continue in that direction next year.”

“Kiss a crew boy” and “go streaking” were just a few of the goals expressed in chalk on a school-wide ‘bucket list,’ where students are encouraged to express the one thing they wish they could do before they graduate.
Hanging on Meyer Gate between the Science Center and Thayer Hall, the “Before I Graduate” list is a 23-foot-long chalkboard with the words “I want to,” followed by a blank space. Passers-by can use chalk hanging off the board to complete the sentence with whatever hopes and dreams they have for their futures.
The board is filled with heartfelt, fun, messages and playful goals. But more emotional messages—“make a difference” and “not feel ashamed to be myself”—have found a place on the chalkboard as well.
The idea for the project came from a similar sign hung in New Orleans, according to George Zisiadis ’11, who called the chalkboard “a fun, playful community bucket list.” He, Erika M. Lovin ’11, and members of the Senior Class Committee are leading the project.
By this point the stark black board is covered with wishes drawn graffiti-style in brightly colored chalk.  Lovin said she hopes the student body—and especially seniors—take the sign to heart.
“As something done by the Senior Class Committee, we wanted to get seniors to think about the things they wanted to do before they graduate,” Lovin said.
But organizers emphasized that, although the exercise is mostly targeted towards seniors, the chalkboard is meant for the entire Harvard community to enjoy.
“It is especially aimed toward seniors but it is something the entire campus can get involved in, whether they write their own things or they are just observing what other people write,” Zisiadis said.
“You don’t have to wait ’til senior year to think of all the things you want to do before you graduate.”
The sign has caught the attention of many underclassmen wandering in and out of the Yard.
“It’s a good idea to have a sense of what you want to accomplish before you leave” college, Christopher H. Cleveland ’14 said. “Especially early on, I think too many people go through college and then want to go back.”
Especially in light of the oft-expressed sentiment that the semesters have flown by—freshman concluding their time in Annenberg and juniors gearing up for intense work on senior theses the next year—Lovin said she thinks the sign can be just as meaningful to underclassmen as it is for seniors.
“Time at Harvard is really special and is definitely limited for everyone,” Lovin said. “So there are absolutely things the underclassmen can get out of it too—probably just as much if not more than the seniors, knowing they have more time to do the things on their bucket list.”
Zisiadis said he too wants the community to take advantage of the time they have left in college.
“People get into a rut, and we wanted to tell people to go have fun and don’t wait to do the things you want to do,” Zisiadis said.

Daniel J. Bennett ’85 and Gerard T. Leone ’85 were roommates in Kirkland House in 1983.
Twenty-eight years later, they are prosecutors in the high-profile murder case of a shooting that took place in the basement of that same House.
Jabrai Jordan Copney allegedly shot Justin Cosby—a Cambridge resident—on May 18, 2009, after a drug deal gone wrong in the basement of Kirkland’s J-entryway.
Bennett, now an assistant district attorney, is serving as the senior prosecutor in Copney’s trial and Leone is the current Middlesex District Attorney.
Assistant District Attorney David M. Solet, another prosecutor in the case, graduated from Harvard Law School in 2001.
Bennett and Leone’s relation to Harvard was brought to the forefront when defense attorney John A. Amabile questioned a former Harvard student involved in the case who took the stand as a witness for the prosecution.
On April 8, Amabile asked the student if, upon agreeing to cooperate, she knew of Bennett’s and Leone’s background and if she had expected that their ties could help her get her diploma when she signed the agreement.
The judge admitted Bennett’s and Leone’s ties to Harvard into evidence after the former student’s testimony, raising the question of whether the prosecution’s Harvard connections will have an impact on Copney’s trial.
"THESE HARVARD ALUMNI"
On June 5, 2009, Chanequa N. Campbell signed an agreement with the District Attorney’s office that allowed her to testify without having the evidence used against her.
Campbell, who was formerly part of the Class of 2009, was friends with Copney’s girlfriend, also a former Harvard student, at the time of the shooting.
In the wake of the incident, Campbell was denied a degree by the College due to her connection with the Kirkland shooting.
Amabile said that as a part of the agreement, signed by Bennett on behalf of Leone, the prosecution may have suggested that Campbell could still earn her degree if she cooperated in the case against Copney.
“She’s thinking that if she comes around, maybe these Harvard alumni will get her reinstated,” Amabile said during his opening statement.
When Amabile questioned Campbell during Copney’s trial, he asked her if she expected that the prosecution’s Harvard ties would help her receive her diploma.
Bennett objected to Amabile’s question and, during a side bar conference, the judge overruled the objection, admitting the two men’s ties to Harvard as evidence in the entire trial.
“Somebody might question whether it would have been appropriate for the district attorney to excuse himself from the case,” Amabile said in a later interview.
PERSONAL TIES
Prosecutors and defense attorneys independent from the case who were interviewed for this article said that the prosecutors’ Harvard connections could become an ethical issue in the trial if their ties to the school cause them to treat the trial differently.
But the lawyers interviewed said that the Harvard connections likely have minimally impacted the case.
“It doesn’t sound like there’s any sort of conflict of interest,” said William Barabino, a criminal defense attorney in Wakefield, Mass. “Because essentially the school is not the defendant.”
Scott D. Bradley, a criminal defense attorney in West Bridgewater, Mass., describes Leone as a person who prioritizes “rules of professional responsibility.”
“They’re all well versed in the law and in the rules of ethics,” Bradley said of prosecutors in the Middlesex Superior Court.
Barabino said that the Harvard ties are not unusual because Harvard graduates often remain in the area.
“It’s just a natural consequence. Someone has to prosecute the crime, and it just happens to be them,” Barabino said.
But lawyers said that the prosecution’s personal ties could affect their enthusiasm in prosecuting the case.
“You might be a little bit motived to just check things over a few extra times and try even harder than you’ve ever tried before because you have that extra motivation,” Bradley said.
“If anything it would be make me particularly zealous about the case,” said Michael K. Bachrach, a New York criminal defense attorney.
MEN OF HARVARD
During their time at Harvard, Bennett and Leone became close friends, according to Robert J. Mazzone ’85, who was roommates with Leone all four years at Harvard.
He said that the two students found a lot of their personal history in common.
Both Bennett and Leone, who played on the Harvard football team, had fathers that were high school football coaches.
When Bennett and Leone attended Harvard, the housing lottery was not randomized and students were allowed to list their preferred Houses.
At the time, Kirkland House was known as “the jock House,” according to Mazzone.
“[Kirkland] was a very fun, very casual place. [Bennett and Leone] loved it,” Mazzone said. “They were very loyal to Kirkland.”
During his four years, Leone juggled academics, football, and boxing while holding a job in order to help pay his tuition.
“Gerry was a kid who was excited to be at Harvard. He worked extremely hard and focused a lot more on schoolwork than most people,” Mazonne said. “He’s always going to give 100 percent.”
With the name of Bennett’s and Leone’s alma mater admitted into evidence, the jury will have the responsibility of interpreting the role of the Harvard connection in the trial.
Closing statements in Copney’s trial are scheduled to take place this week in Middlesex Superior Court.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four members of the Student Labor Action Movement attended Harvard President Drew G. Faust’s office hours yesterday in order to ask for more job protections for workers, greater transparency in the University’s spending, and divestment from HEI Hotels and Resorts—a corporation that some allege violates workers’ rights.
The four students—William F. Poff-Webster ’14, Sandra Y.L. Korn ’14, William P. Whitham ’14, and Anna J. Murphy ’12, each presented to the president for between 10 and 20 minutes yesterday on their respective subjects. Poff-Webster and Korn are both active Crimson editorial editors.
Whitham says that he urged Faust to fight for better benefits for dining hall workers, noting that these employees lack job security and have recently suffered a decline in compensation.
“There has been about a $900 decrease per worker in annual wage from 2009 to 2010,” he said. “That may not seem like a lot, but that is about two weeks on a dining hall worker’s salary.”
Whitham also provided Faust with a list of SLAM’s demands for the University, which include providing a living wage and benefits for dining hall staff and greater job security for workers, according to Whitham.
Korn, who discussed divestment from HEI with Faust, said that she was motivated to go to Faust because sending a report on the company, which has been accused of union busting and worker mistreatment, to Harvard’s Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility was unsuccessful.
Korn spoke to Faust about stories that had been told to her by HEI workers discussing their poor working conditions. She then summarized the findings of SLAM’s report on HEI and urged Faust to fight for divestment from the company.
In addition, Poff-Webster and Murphy asked Faust to support the Higher Education Right-to-Know Act, a bill introduced by two Massachusetts State Senators last January that would require universities with investments or property valued at more than $10 million to reveal details about their contracts with outside companies and about individual employees, such as faculty making over $250,000 per year.
The students said they had mixed views about their interactions with Faust.
“She said, basically, ‘Sorry, I can’t do anything,” Korn said.
But Korn said that Brown Unversity President Ruth J. Simmons played a key role in Brown’s decision not to reinvest in HEI.
“If the Brown president can do it, I assume the University structure is not that different at Harvard,” Korn said.
Poff-Webster said that he agreed with some of Faust’s points, such as the need for universities to have private investment in order to stay ahead of the market, but he said he felt the University needs to “moderate” profit with its ethical obligations.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: APRIL 19, 2011
The April 19 article "SLAM Members Meet with Faust" incorrectly stated that Brown University has decided to divest from HEI Hotels and Resorts. In fact, the university has chosen not to reinvest in the company.

In the grand scheme of things, Rhode Island and Connecticut aren’t that far away from the Charles River, but the big breezes of the open water seemed worlds away from the protected Charles to which Harvard’s sailors have grown accustomed.
But a change in the winds couldn’t slow down the Crimson coeds, who managed to qualify for the national semifinals in California. The coeds’ finish was the highlight of a weekend of strong performances by Harvard’s two sailing teams.
NEW ENGLAND COED DINGHY CHAMPIONSHIP
All the Crimson coeds had to do to qualify for the ICSA Eastern Dinghy Championship Semifinals at Long Beach, Calif. was place eighth. Instead, Harvard far exceeded its goal with a fourth-place finish in the Port Judith Refuge.
“Overall we’re very pleased,” senior Teddy Himler said. “We really showed a lot of heart, a lot of effort...Each member of the team put the team on their back.”
Senior John Stokes sailed in the first two B Division races, before Himler took over for the remaining nine. Sophomores Jason Michas and Alma Lafler and senior Meghan Wareham crewed in the division, with Lafler racing with Himler for the final seven races. The five sailors combined for a first-place finish, a second-place finish, four third-place finishes, and two fifth-place finishes.
“In those conditions when people are flipping, we were able to stay disciplined and make fewer mistakes,” Himler said.
Just as impressive was the performance of its A Division sailors: senior skipper Alan Palmer and sophomore crew Ryan Byrne.
Palmer and Byrne raced together for 11 of the 12 races. The Crimson placed fifth in the division after recording a first-place finish and three second-place finishes in the individual races.
“They worked really hard,” Himler said. “Alan was a total beast, trimming in the main, hiking. Ryan is a really strong guy, put all his muscle into it.”
“We had some really good finishes,” Palmer added. “We had a few other ones where we had some major screw-ups...In general, I think we were pretty fast, especially in big winds and big waves which we don’t practice in.”
While the Crimson still needs to finish in the top-eight in Long Beach in two weeks to earn the right to head to Portland, Ore., for the national championships, the results gave the coeds confidence in their chances to excel on the biggest stage.
“Should we do well in California, these conditions—big waves, big wind, cold water, should prepare us well for nationals,” Himler said.
WOMEN’S  EMILY WICK/SLOOP SHREW
While it did not obtain the same success as the coed team, the women’s sailors still managed to post several strong finishes en route to a 10th-place overall finish on the Thames at a regatta hosted by the Coast Guard Academy.
Junior Emily Lambert and freshman Caitlin Watson, who teamed up to take seventh in the A Division, were responsible for many of these top finishes. Lambert and Watson recorded three third-place finishes before winning the final race of the regatta.
“It was cool to see [Lambert] sail because she is very talented,” Watson said. “Emily was really consistent. We were able to keep the boat upright. She’s definitely experienced in wind, so that definitely helps.”
Meanwhile freshmen Morgan Russom and Isabel Ruane placed 14th in the B Division.
“I thought that we definitely improved as the races progressed,” Russom said. “I think we learned a lot at this weekend’s races.”
SAVIN HILL INVITATIONAL
The Crimson contingent that travelled to Dorchester Bay was a model of consistency. All of its sailors placed fourth in their respective divisions to give Harvard a fourth-place finish overall.
Sophomores Nick Waldo and Jinyan Zang gave the Crimson three top-five finishes in the A Division. The Crimson’s B Division sailors, freshmen Luke O’Connor, Diana Powell, and Sarah Pierson, didn’t post as high finishes as their A Division counterparts, but their consistency was enough to place Harvard above its more erratic opponents in the division.
OBERG TROPHY
A seventh-place finish in the A Division paced the Crimson to its 11th overall finish in the Charles River basin. Senior Colin Santangelo and junior William White, who is also a Crimson news editor, earned two top-five finishes and four sixth-place finishes in the effort. Freshmen Ben Lamont and Alice Kenney placed 12th in the B Division.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is joy in Mudville.
Unlike the Casey from Ernest Thayer’s famous poem “Casey at the Bat,” Harvard freshman Kasey Lange delivered clutch hits for the Crimson last week. In the Harvard softball team’s doubleheader against Holy Cross last Tuesday, Lange slammed three home runs over the fence and had a combined nine RBI.
Lange wasted no time in giving the Crusaders trouble. With two outs and two strikes in the bottom of the first inning, Lange boomed a homer to right field that gave the Crimson an early lead.
Her next two RBI came in the second and fourth innings.
Lange hit two singles that allowed her co-captain Ellen Macadam to score both times.
The first game of the doubleheader ended with Harvard on top, 8-1. In six innings, Lange managed to go 3-for-4 with a home run and three RBI, ultimately contributing to half of the Crimson’s runs.
But Game 1 was merely a teaser for Holy Cross, which was about to experience an even more deadly performance by Lange in the second game.
In her first at-bat, Lange popped out to the second baseman, but that was the last time she would allow the Crusaders to get the better of her.
Down 4-0 going into the bottom of the third inning, Harvard needed an offensive boost. After a double from junior Jane Alexander and a single to the shortstop by Macadam, Lange found herself at bat with her team losing, 4-1.
With the count at one ball and one strike, the rookie found the sweet spot of her bat again and sailed a ball over the left-field fence, sending her and Macadam around to home plate.
Still trailing by one run in the bottom of the fourth, the Crimson bats started to take action. During its rally, Harvard took over the lead, and Lange stepped up to the plate with her team up, 6-4, and two runners in scoring position. Lange then walloped a double to left field that caused both runners on base to score.
The double gave the Crimson even more confidence as it transitioned into the fifth inning. Even though Harvard had a comfortable cushion in the sixth inning, Lange did not slow down.
In her final at-bat of the day and with a runner on second, she slammed yet another home run to right-center field.
“I think [Lange’s] home runs are proof of how she goes up to each at-bat with a great mental attitude and great clarity and just attacks the ball,” junior teammate Whitney Shaw said.
Lange’s last home run helped catalyze yet another Crimson rally that put the nail in the coffin for Holy Cross, securing Harvard’s victory.
The game was called after six innings due to the mercy rule, but Lange still finished with three hits, two home runs, and six RBI.
Although Lange had an exceptionally stellar game on Tuesday, she regularly helps her team in tight situations. In fact, Lange drove in at least one run in each of the Crimson’s seven games last week, finishing with 18 RBI as Harvard went 6-1.
“She’s just a clutch hitter, and she comes up [in] big situations for us,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said. “She’s hitting No. 3 in the lineup, which is typically a strong RBI-producing hitter, which she has been. Whenever we’ve needed a big hit, she has been able to come through in the clutch.”
These clutch hits have translated into Lange’s stats. Among the softball players in the Ivy League who have played in at least 75% of their team’s games, Lange is ranked first in doubles (17), second in home runs (7) and slugging percentage (.746), and third in batting average (.407) behind teammate Macadam, who is hitting .420.
Lange also leads the league in RBI with 48, almost doubling the number of the runner-up.
But the stats and big plays Lange produces are not an individual effort.
“[Macadam] and [sophomore Stephanie Regan], who hit ahead of her, do a good job of getting on base in front of her and give [Lange] the opportunity to come up with a big hit to score them,” Allard said.
While Lange’s teammates help her get on the Ivy League leaderboards, she also returns the favor. Macadam stands first in the league in runs scored (37), aided by her own third-ranked number of hits (48) and fourth-ranked on-base percentage (.465).
Through individual and team efforts, Lange has proved herself as a big slugger for Harvard in her rookie season.
“She’s a really good hitter for us, and I think she’s made a tremendous impact her freshman year,” Allard said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Japanese and lacrosse usually don’t go hand-in-hand. But for men’s lacrosse sophomore goaltender Harry Krieger, the Asian language and culture bear many similarities to the sport that he has been playing since he was five years old.
“In Japanese, you have to be assertive and confident in what you are saying,” Krieger explains. “When you’re trying to tell your teammates what’s going on in front of you as a goalie, you also have to be very assertive or you will sound like you’re not in control.”
The Crimson’s goalkeeper is having a career season—he has started all 12 games and recorded a career-high 19 saves in a comeback win against No.14 UMass on March 29—all while renewing his interest in Japanese.
“I did it through high school and then I started it again this year,” Krieger says. “I’ve learned new things about the language and culture. The program moves very fast and I love it.”
Krieger’s mother, Kathie Krieger, attributes the goalie’s interest in Japanese to family experiences.
“His older brother took Japanese and spent two summers in Tokyo,” Kathie says. “We also hosted a Japanese exchange student for a year. So that’s how he got into it.”
In addition to being an academic interest, Japanese has also inspired Krieger’s attitude on the field.
“When you’re on the field, you’re not only representing yourself,” Krieger says. “You’re also representing your family, school, and teammates. So honor and respect must always be there, which is consistent with the Japanese culture...If you’re not doing your best, you’re disrespecting your family. And in lacrosse, your team is like your family.”
With that mentality, the netminder has developed into one of the leaders of the team, despite it being only his second year on the squad.
“As the goalkeeper, you’re the last line of defense,” says Crimson coach Chris Wojcik ’96. “So you’re expected to be a leader, and this year he has emerged as one of our defensive leaders. He’s a guy that our team really looks for direction and communication on defense.”
“He’s the leader of our defense,” sophomore midfielder Ryan Stevens echoes. “He directs pretty much everything that happens on the defense side of the field. He’s like the quarterback of our defense.”
Krieger’s quick rise to leadership is no surprise to his high school coach, Rick Brocato, who says that Krieger’s approach to academics and lacrosse made him well-respected by peers and elders alike.
“He understood the value of academics, leadership, and citizenship,” says the St. Paul’s men’s lacrosse head coach. “He didn’t demand the respect of everybody; he commanded it.”
During his high school years at St. Paul’s, Krieger broke his collarbone three times playing lacrosse. As remarkable as his recoveries are, how he handled the injuries at the moment is arguably even more impressive.
“It was like having an assistant coach,” Brocato recalls. “He would help the defense and the backup goalie in understanding our defensive strategies in practice and games. He also worked really hard to strengthen the shoulder so he could come back in his best shape.”
“When you’re in high school, you’re like ‘God, there goes my chances of playing in college,’” Kathie Krieger adds. “But that never crossed his mind. He was always focused on fixing it and getting better.”
The ability to quickly overcome adversities in his mind has helped Krieger both on and off the field.
“His optimistic outlook on life is really beneficial to the team and makes him a pleasure to be around off the field,” Stevens says. “He’s a great guy who’s always upbeat and takes everything with a grain of salt.”
Yet with all of Krieger’s abilities, those who know him say his most admirable trait is his unwavering focus in accomplishing what needs to be done.
“When he gets on the field, he’s extremely focused,” his mother says. “And that’s how he is in general. He’s very detail-oriented, and you can see that in his play.”
Krieger’s focus and attention to detail has helped him develop a keen sense for the game, which enables him to provide the team with timely support.
“Once we were down a lot against Calvert Hall,” Brocato says. “But Harry made an unbelievable, point-blank save and proceeded to run the length of the field to score on the other goalie. It was a real shot in the arm. We did eventually lose the game, but our team played with a renewed confidence after that.”
With such poise and talents, Krieger appears to have a bright future ahead of him.
“Every year he gets better and we can only wait to see what he can become.” Kathie says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like the Harvard school year, Ivy League sports are starting to wrap up. Baseball only has two weekends of league play left before playoffs begin, and both men’s and women’s golf conclude this weekend at the Ivy League Championships. In both sports, there’s been some recent turnover at the top. In baseball, Yale shocked Dartmouth this weekend to grab control of the Red Rolfe Division. But in men’s golf, the Bulldogs slipped, finishing third this weekend after dominating at their previous tournament. We’ll tell you just what you need to know in this week’s edition of Around the Water Cooler. 
Last weekend got off to an unexpected start in the world of Ivy League baseball. The Red Rolfe Division looks a lot different now than it did a few days ago. Coming into its four-game road trip against Yale, Dartmouth held a comfortable two-game lead in the division. The two-time defending champions of the Ivy League, the Big Green looked poised to win the Rolfe Division for the fourth consecutive year.
But now, Dartmouth is in an unfamiliar spot: second place.
Yale thrashed the Big Green, surprisingly winning all four games over the weekend by a combined score of 19-3. Dartmouth, which leads the Ancient Eight in almost every offensive category, couldn’t get anything going at New Haven, failing to score more than one run in a game. With the sweep, Yale now has a two-game lead on the rest of the division and a decent shot to win its first Ivy Championship since 1994.
Harvard also showed some life this weekend. After dropping its first two games at Brown, the Crimson broke out on Saturday, scoring an average of 9 runs a game to beat the Bears twice and remain relevant in the Ivy League championship discussion. But Harvard is still five back in the division and will need to do well this weekend at home against the Bulldogs or risk being mathematically out of contention. In fact, if Harvard doesn’t win three or more game against Yale, then the Crimson’s done.
While the Bulldogs had a big weekend in baseball, things didn’t go quite as well in men’s golf. After dominating Apr. 9-10, shooting a total of -4 to win the Princeton Invitational, the Bulldogs didn’t come close to matching that performance this past weekend at The Century Intercollegiate tournament. Thanks in large part to rough weather conditions, Yale shot +66, good enough for a third-place finish. Harvard rebounded from a rough Princeton Invitational to win its first tournament of the year. The Crimson will try to carry that momentum into the year’s final tournament: the Ivy League Championship.
The Harvard women’s golf team found itself in a similar position as its male counterpart. After failing to win a tournament all year, something clicked for the women in the Spring Brown Bear Invitational, their most recent competition. While the squad failed to win, Harvard had the low-score on the second day en route to a solid second-place finish. The Crimson also finishes its season this weekend at the Ivy League Championships, where it finished third last year.

Some surprising visitors have been causing quite a stir in Allston recently. According to local residents in an email forum, turkeys have been spotted making their way into backyards, circling barbecue grills, and wobbling alongside their human-counterparts on busy streets.
Resident Sarah H. Ayanian recently saw a wild turkey roaming around her garden in Lower Allston, and, in an email, poked fun at the irony of later finding the turkey standing within feet of her grill.
"This guy/gal even gives a new spin on the term 'grilling turkey!'" Ayanian wrote.
Resident Jim Creamer said that the birds paid his home a visit as well.
"Yes, turkeys have invaded North Allston too. We found one on our front porch on Aldie Street Friday morning, big as a, well, pretty damn big," Creamer wrote in an email.
One of the birds was even spotted in the Cambridge area, venturing as far as Canaday Hall, where it stooped on a windowsill and surprised freshmen residents looking out from their windows.

"Are we having fun yet?" The question was barely audible in the dark basement of Uno's on Thursday night, where students came out to support the Harvard Cancer Society in its date auction, Wanted. One of the event’s emcees, Christopher J. Guenard '12, enthusiastically responded, "It doesn't matter since we’re raising money for cancer research!"
Guenard's words succinctly summarized the night: ridiculous and often awkward, but certainly for a good cause. About a dozen students boldly donated themselves to the highest bidder—at least for the remainder of the night. Emcees introduced students with outlandish photos and corny pickup lines. All proceeds, including a percentage from the food and beverages bought went towards Harvard’s Relay for Life, the American Cancer Society 24-hour walk/run-a-thon.
"Last year we had a date auction and it brought in a lot of support for Relay for Life," said Lydia K. Chung '14, one of the event chairs of the Harvard Cancer Society. "Since formal season is coming up it would be a great opportunity for people to meet new people."
Although the date auction helped raise hundreds of dollars for a serious cause, the event could hardly be taken seriously. The first person to be auctioned off, Oliver R. McNally '12, incited a relatively intense bidding war—among his bros.
"It was fun. I had some of my friends bid [for me]." McNally said. "I had a good time and it was for a good cause." He was ultimately sold for a respectable $52, nobly sacrificing a few moments of awkwardness for cancer research.
Three Delta Gamma sisters opted to be auctioned off as a group package. Signa L. Mahung '14, Alyssa M. Blaize '12, and Monica C. Nesselbush '14 added some variety to the date auction. It may not have been the place to find your future soul mate, but it was certainly a charitable way to spend your Thursday night.

Nearly 27,000 participants and a half-million spectators attended the 115th Boston Marathon yesterday. Geoffrey Mutai of Kenya placed first in the men's division and set a new world's-best marathon time.
