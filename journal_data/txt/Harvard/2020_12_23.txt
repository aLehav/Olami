Basking in his personal success and the recent Lakers championship, Gibbs takes a victory lap with heavyweight assists from rapper Big Sean and producer Hit-Boy. “4 Thangs” is likely a reference to his last four albums, all of which were released to critical acclaim and are now considered classics. The track debuted with an NBA-themed music video that features Gibbs, Sean, and Hit-Boy in Lakers gear participating in post-championship celebrations.
All three members of the “4 Thangs” team are powerhouse artists with West Coast ties. Gibbs, originally from Gary, Indiana, has made Los Angeles his second home. He affirmed his allegiance to the West Coast on “Lakers,” the thirteenth track off his 2014 album “Piñata” which was produced by Madlib. Earlier this year, Gibbs released an album with legendary LA producer The Alchemist. Like Alchemist, Hit-Boy is one of the pre-eminent West Coast producers hailing from Fontana, California. He has production credits on some of the most significant rap albums of the last decade including the 2011 Jay-Z/Kanye West team-up “Watch the Throne” and Kendrick Lamar’s 2013 project “good kid, m.A.A.d city.” And Sean, who has regularly occupied the charts throughout his career, identifies his sound with Detroit, but was born in Santa Monica. On “4 Thangs,” the three artists constitute a West Coast power team.
The group’s collaboration is a kinetic celebration of rap dominance. Gibbs and Sean trade verses back and forth with dizzying speed and infectious confidence. With effortless delivery, Sean brags: “I give you the game, I don't play for the love of the game / I play for the rings.” Gibbs and Sean first appeared on the scene as part of the 2010 XXL Freshman Class, and and a decade later, the pair continue to be dominant forces in hip-hop and to bring out the very best in each other. Gibbs speaks on Sean’s success as one of the biggest rappers out of Detroit: “I fuck with Sean Don, he run the D like Barry Sanders.” In September, Sean’s latest album, “Detroit 2,” debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard album chart, ending Taylor Swift’s six-week run. For his work on Sean’s project and other collaborations, including an album with Griselda Records rapper Benny the Butcher, Hit-Boy won Producer of the Year at the 2020 BET Awards.
Hit-Boy’s hard-hitting, polished production is the perfect vehicle for the natural chemistry between Gibbs and Sean. Clocking in at just under two minutes, the track is more stripped down than Hit-Boy’s work on Sean’s album, but is still packed with swagger and flair. By placing an easy synth loop over the beat’s driving 808s, Hit-Boy creates the perfect vehicle for the pair’s braggadocious flow. A simpler beat allows the song to rise on the strength of Gibbs and Sean’s lyricism. The drums match up with the rappers’ energetic verses to throw an efficiently-packaged punch.
Marking the first collaboration between Hit-Boy and Gibbs, the track is a showcase of the latter’s stylistic diversity and an affirmation of his talent. Hit-Boy’s modern West Coast production is a departure from the ’90s era New York City beat-making on his two projects with Madlib and two albums with The Alchemist. Gibbs mainly exists within the throwback lane of hip-hop, frequently collaborating with the Buffalo-based label Griselda Records. In recent years, with Gibbs and Griselda as leaders, ’90s era rap has begun to reinfiltrate the mainstream. Yet, throughout his career, Gibbs has maintained a crossover appeal missing from his peers in the vintage underground. His 2018 album “Freddie” features production from current hip-hop go-to producer Kenny Beats, and a verse from incarcerated Watts rapper 03 Greedo. “4 Thangs” is a reminder of Gibbs’ capabilities as a five tool player. Showing off his ability to successfully run the gamut of rap subgenres, the single reminds listeners why Gibbs is one of the best in the game.

Taking its name from the lyrics of his pre-released track “as long as you care,” “Bright Lights, Red Eyes” is Ruel’s third EP, following in the wake of earlier well-known radio singles like “Dazed and Confused” and “Painkiller.” At the age of 18, his tone already holds an impressive maturity, perhaps best described as a cross between Troye Sivan’s enveloping ephemerality and Shawn Mendes’ raw directness. Combined with his classic, introspective charm, it’s easy to be a fan of the British-Australian singer — if he isn’t quite an established name in the industry yet, it doesn’t seem to be far off in his future.
Across all five songs in the EP, the openings are carefully and consistently crafted — intros composed of short, simple instrumentals allow Ruel’s voice to take on an honest, distinctive clarity, building a sense of sincerity through the melody before the beat kicks in. There are also significant improvements in his songwriting: From the vague “somethin’ bout you”s in his breakthrough “Dazed and Confused” to the intricate details of “wet paper on the doorstep, rainin’ all night” in the songs here, there is a much more atmospheric, storied quality to his current trajectory. In particular, the first few lines of “as long as you care” are unconventional, lyrical, and lovely: “I’m sundried, my lips are high on overdrive.” They set the tone for the EP — one of reflective solitude and tired resignation towards love, caught in the space between past memories and future promises.
The third song, “courage,” which Ruel pairs with a filtered, retro-hued visualizer, stands out as a gem in the middle of the EP. Underlaid with chords that recall “Painkiller” on his previous EP “Free Time,” the melody offers a balance between warm familiarity and refreshing authenticity. Its final repetition of “if I try again,” sung in an unexpected falsetto near the end, holds a raw immediacy, with echoes of a chorus and synth reverbs interspersed to create an immersive dimensionality throughout.
Credit is also owed to Ruel’s producer, M-Phazes, who lends to the project the experience that Ruel doesn’t have alone — resulting in mature, complex songs that set him apart from other up-and-coming young pop artists. Having worked with big industry names like Demi Lovato, Kehlani, and Eminem, there is a nuanced, layered richness to M-Phazes’ production: “Bright Lights” displays clear influences of genres like R&B and soul in the percussion style and perfectly executed runs of “say it over,” while “up to something” takes on a more EDM sound.
Yet even as consecutive listens to the EP as a whole bring out endearing nuances and quirks, the songs admittedly begin to blend into one another, and it’s unclear whether their order curates any distinctive narrative listeners can’t get from playing them on shuffle. Despite the warm, comforting familiarity of Ruel’s mellow synth tones, one begins to wish for a bit more edge. While avoiding the overly heavy, formulaic beats of his past singles, Ruel’s repeated portrayals of one-sided relationships begin to exhibit a frustrating passivity, without adding any new perspectives. Through adjectives like “bright” and “red,” the very title of the EP implies an intensity that doesn’t quite manifest, lost in the crooning softness.
As his lyrics yearn for a lover just out of physical or temporal reach, the listener can’t help but feel the same sense of expectancy, only to be left without closure once the refrain of “up to something” finally fades away. But of course, Ruel still has so much time to develop towards his potential as an artist. Having established a strong, original sound through all these EPs, it will be interesting to wait for the direction he takes in a full album — and in the meantime, he’ll keep us watching and listening to the bright lights.

“This song should not exist in 2020 America,” Bright Eyes frontman Conor Oberst wrote in the press release for the band's new single “Miracle of Life.” The song, which tells the story of a botched coathanger abortion, was released a little more than a week before the general election alongside Oberst’s entreaties for his listeners to vote. “Miracle of Life” is biting and tragic, successfully employing an ironic tone to highlight the horrors of backdoor abortions.
“Miracle of Life,” which Oberst describes in the press release as “a protest song, I guess,” manages to make a statement without falling into the classic pitfalls of songs with political agendas. Rather than preach or serve heavy-handed messages about urgency, “Miracle of Life'' approaches its subject matter with distance. Oberst exemplifies this attitude when he tells the story of a car breaking down as the song’s characters attempt to cross state-lines to access an abortion, exclaiming “what a drag.” This detached tone, in contrast to the pain and suffering of the song’s protagonist, is off-putting but clearly purposeful. Hearing botched abortions referred to casually serves as a frightening reminder of the widespread lack of access to safe reproductive health care. Furthermore, the coldness of Oberst’s attitude, combined with the personal nature of the story he’s telling, underline the horror of these unnecessary deaths in the face of a country that remains apathetic. Ending each chorus with  “Get cured with a coat hanger/ Girl you're in America now,” Oberst and Bridgers ensure it’s impossible to look away.
“Miracle of Life” also cleverly subverts the language of the right-wing. Even the title of the track, which is repeated throughout the choruses, jabs at the hypocrisy of valuing the lives of the unborn over those of the women who are forced into unsafe medical situations by lack of access to abortions. Additionally, with its country rock sound, the single engages with the aesthetic of the religious right before using that same language to criticize their politics. For example, about two-thirds through the track, (right before the main character passes away due to complications from her coathanger abortion) the more twangy country instrumental line distorts into what sounds almost like a siren, as though revealing a hidden darkness.
While “Miracle of Life” is both biting and harsh, the addition of featured indie darling Phoebe Bridgers brings depth and empathy to the song. Bridgers and Oberst are no stranger to collaboration, notably having released an album together last year called “Better Oblivion Community Center.” While in their previous work Bridgers and Oberst sing together with equal power and force, on “Miracle of Life” Bridgers appears distanced and removed. Her voice, which joins Obersts for each chorus, is clear, reserved, and almost wail-like in comparison to Oberst’s gruffer tone. In a song which follows the death and suffering of an unnamed woman, told primarily through the voice of a man, the effect of Bridgers’ distant lamentations is a powerful one, as she gives voice to the pain suffered by the song's anonymous main character.
As election season has mostly come to a close, “Miracle of Life” remains a haunting reminder of the grim reality that does exist and will likely continue to exist for many Americans, regardless of who occupies the White House. Bright Eyes’ new single may not present a manifesto or revolutionize the conversation about abortion, but its attempts to ground the discussion in the personal realities of reproductive rights are impactful and incredibly successful.

Avant-garde jazz pianist and composer Angelica Sanchez is no stranger to high-profile collaborations. Having previously worked with the likes of trumpeter Wadada Leo Smith and bassist Richard Davis, Sanchez teams up with fellow pianist and free jazz artist Marilyn Crispell on her latest album “How to Turn the Moon.” The Harvard Crimson sat down with Sanchez to talk about her artistic processes, neuroscience, and her latest recording.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you begin playing and composing jazz?
Angelica Sanchez: I was about 10 years old, and I decided that's what I wanted to do. We saw some local musicians, and ever since then, I started studying and playing jazz. As a small child, my father had a bunch of records that I wasn't interested in initially. Then when I realized what they were, I was like this is — this is what I want to do. Then in high school, I started composing. I was taking lessons at that time and part of our lessons was to compose. I was always interested in composing. So then that just grew and grew and grew. As I got older, I studied more and more. Those things sort of happen gradually.
THC: How did you and Marilyn Crispell start working together and how did you decide to work on “How to Turn the Moon”?
AS: I've been a big fan of Marylin's since probably my teenage years. We met some time ago, at a music camp run by Karl Berger. I was thrilled to meet her, and she knew who I was. She’s a very lovely and generous person. We just started creating a friendship and sharing our lives with each other. Out of that friendship, about a year later, I said, ‘How would you feel about recording some of my music?’ So I started sharing with her some of my ideas and what I wanted to do. She writes poetry and paints. It was a cross of all of these things coming together. So a year later we recorded it and that's how it came about. We have this beautiful friendship now because of it. We had a really nice friendship before, but it's really when we started making music with each other that it felt like home.
THC: How do you feel that a pre-established friendship or a relationship with someone impacts the quality of your work as musical collaborators, especially within the realm of improvisation?
AS: Well, to be an improviser, you have to be able to be vulnerable with somebody and still have intimacy in that relationship — on a deeper level than almost any other relationship. So a friendship helps. I can feel the love when I sit down and when we play together. It's all around us, and it gets on everything, which is a wonderful thing. Do I think it's necessary? I don't know. I hear stories of amazing recordings where people were at each other's throats. But I have a feeling that music sort of transcends all that, and when you're in the music, you forget about those things. But it's really lovely when you have deep friendships like that.
THC: How did you Crispell balance the pre-composed and the improvised elements of the record?
AS: Well, I purposely wrote shorter pieces because I wanted to give us the freedom to expand as we wanted to. Taking a small idea and turning it into something larger is something that Marylin's a master at. And I knew that, so I purposely wrote shorter pieces, so we had the freedom to expand something as we saw fit, to change the architecture of something, or even the form of something, if we wanted. The improvisation sort of became rather seamless with the composition at times, which is the effect I really was going for. So, I wrote expansive pieces that could definitely morph into something else, or evolve into something else, which is usually what happens anyway.
THC: Does your desire to collaborate with another artist come from your personal connection and friendship with them, or is it more their artistic style?
AS:  It's usually their art that I'm initially attracted to, if it resonates with me. And then, oftentimes you meet that person, you create a really lovely friendship. That adds even more depth to the music you might make. You don't always know if it's gonna be good or not. You just have an idea and you want to have it realized. I believe that if you're honest with yourself about what kind of artists you are — what kind of music you're going to make — that's all that matters in the end. I couldn't tell you if it was good or bad, but I can tell you that it's honest, and that our connection is a really meaningful, beautiful connection. So that's all I can hope for it when I make music with someone.
THC: You’ve talked a lot about your interest in neuroscience and biology. Could you talk a little bit about where these interests come from? And how do they influence your music?
AS: Well, it's sort of a bit corny to say that all things are connected, but they really are connected, and we're connected to, you know, asteroids out in space. We've always sort of been interested in how our bodies mimic things in nature over and over again. Childbirth mimics things in the ocean, and I've always been fascinated by that. Neuroscience has been something I'm interested in for a few reasons. I love that there are still neurotransmitters in our brain that we haven't discovered, much like how there's parts of the ocean we haven't discovered. So I love these sort of parallels that happen. Just that mystery that's involved is intriguing to me. Of course, there's books and books and books on neuroscience, and I was also very much attracted to the drawings of Santiago Ramon y Cajal. They call him the father of neuroscience and they're just gorgeous drawings. I guess his father wanted him to be a doctor, and he wanted to be an artist. I don't know if he realized that his pictures would be in museums, you know, so many years later. They had them at NYU. They brought them from Spain. So I got to see them live in-person. And you look at those drawings and they look like trees and things in nature. So, again that connection is fascinating to me.

Beabadoobee has been sitting on the sidelines of today’s indie music scene ever since she self-released her first song, “Coffee,” in 2017. Since then, the Filipino-born singer-songwriter has continued her sure ascent into indie canon — signing onto British indie label Dirty Hit Records, gracing the stage at major music festivals, and touring with a slew of indie artists, including label-mates The 1975 and Massachussett’s own bedroom pop icon, Clairo.
Her releases in the meantime — including 2018’s “Patched Up” and 2019’s “Space Cadet” — have largely been met with critical acclaim, airplay among certain indie-pop circles, and numerous predictions that she’ll be the next big indie breakout star. More recently, the same song that got Beabadoobee (also known as Bea Kristi) her first record deal, “Coffee,” has benefited from a widespread surge in popularity on TikTok and brought the name “Beabadoobee” to the millions of users who make up the app’s largely-Gen Z base. The song started out as a little-known YouTube video, but when it caught the attention of Dirty Hit, quickly racked up over 51 million listens on Spotify.
On her newest release and debut album, “Fake It Flowers,” Beabadoobee parts with that acoustic guitar and other conventions of bedroom pop to forge a powerful kaleidoscope of influences, drawing from 2000s pop rock, 90s alternative and her own past repertoire. With such contrast as the raging guitar solos in “Sorry” immediately preceding the glittering synthscapes in “Further Away,” Beabadoobee continues to prove herself as a dynamic and versatile artist capable of evoking angst just as easily as heartache.
Beabadoobee’s songwriting talent also does justice to each track on the album as the singer explores a wide range of critical themes.
On “Charlie Brown,” the loudest and most uninhibited song on the album, Beabadoobee opens up about her struggles with self-harm. “Back on old habits / That no one knows about / Too bad that Charlie Brown / Has inked you up to slow you down,” she sings about the significance of the Snoopy comic strip tattooed on her arm. By the end of the track, Beabadoobee’s usually pristine voice devolves into screaming as she competes with the chaos of smashing cymbals and thundering power chords.
Another track, “Dye It Red,” features Beabadoobee singing about the damage caused by abusive relationships. “A friend told me this story, about what was essentially an abusive relationship,” she said in an interview. “And it made me really angry, because this is just something that happens so often these days.” The song is slower and more intimate than “Charlie Brown,” but the weight of its subject matter hangs heavily in Beabadoobee’s soft vocals. Here, her ‘90s musical inspirations are clear: The song’s chorus sounds like a blend of Natalie Merchant and Avril Lavigne, the perfect angst-ridden backdrop for the song’s message.
Despite the weight of many of the album’s lyrics, or perhaps in pointed contrast to it, the album’s 90s-alt-inspired sound still invites dancing and late-night listening sessions surrounded by friends. Every track is glittering and vibrant in a pointedly nostalgic way, as though Beabadoobee’s breathing life into the work of her musical influences.
From the very beginning of the album, Beabadoobee transports listeners to a glittering and complex ‘90s-inspired soundscape that she maintains throughout. “This song has end-of-a-’90s movie vibes, like you’re driving down a highway,” Beabadoobee has said of the album’s opening track, “Care.” Indeed, the track, with its bright guitar riffs and punchy vocals, encapsulates exactly that. “Worth It,” too, pulls directly from ‘90s alternative and pop rock influences — a fact made clearer by the contrast between Beabadoobee’s light, airy voice and the clashing of electric guitars and drum hits in the background.
Beabadoobee also holds true to her lyrical roots in songs like “Back to Mars” and “Horen Sarrison.” Echoing the language of “Space Cadet,” She clings to the metaphor of outer space as an escape from the complexities of love (“Ask me again, are we friends or are we something more? / Doesn't it hurt to think about how we were just before?” in “Back to Mars”) and as the place where good things come from (“You are the song that I need for my mental state / You are the bus that stayed when I thought I was late / So I'm convinced you're from outer space” in “Horen Sarrison”).
At its core, “Fake It Flowers” represents a crucial crossroads in Beabadoobee’s career. Her range in both musicality and lyrics takes center stage, allowing Beabadoobee to take up the mantle of ‘90s pop rock icons while exploring the other musical qualities that make her music stand out. Honest, pointed lyrics and shimmering production make the album a must-listen.

Once again, Ariana Grande has shown she can turn any of her life stories — no matter how small or serious — into a captivating album. With “Positions,” Grande delivers an understated addition to her already-impressive discography. The album marks her third release in only two years, proving how deserving she is of her place at the top of the pop charts. “Positions,” released within a month of Grande’s tweet introducing and teasing the new album, follows the stylistic standards set by her previous two records. While remaining consistent at times, Grande allows the sound of this album to breathe, wandering further from stereotypical “pop” into more melody- driven and vocal- heavy multigenre explorations.
The album begins with an orchestral piece, titled “shut up,” which immediately sets the tone for Grande’s outlook on the tumultuous past two years. Grande says those challenges have led to growth, singing “don’t be sad for me” before asking that people stop focusing so heavily on her life. She’s doing well, and anyone who tries to meticulously scrutinize her and her circle needs to “shut up,” as she says.
The second song on the album, “34+35,” hangs onto the stringed accompaniment from the opener as Grande ventures into more intimate subjects. The first two songs have an innocent, even “Disney” sound, as Grande put it in an interview with Zach Sang. But the lyrics themselves are definitely more graphic and R-rated. In that same interview, Grande explains that she tried to write something that directly contradicted the PG Disney vibe. This song’s exploration of romance, intimacy, and sexuality carries on throughout the album.
Most tracks on “Positions” are consistently rhythmic and entrancing in a fashion similar to Grande’s other recent releases, though she balances these prominent rhythms with intricate and at times surprising melodic lines. For instance, the song “motive” featuring Doja Cat has a repetitive, memorable chorus with a driving beat. “off the table,” a slower song featuring The Weeknd, showcases Grande’s voice floating in an unconventional melodic arc.
“Positions” is consistent with the general model of modern pop, full of distinctive rhythms driven by 808s and a plethora of synthetic percussion. Grande doesn’t box herself in with this style; in fact, the standout “my hair” has definite jazz influences in the form of rhythmic distinctions, a wurlitzer-like keyboard, brass interludes, and even a touch of steel drums. Grande’s voice is one of the most versatile and impressive of modern artists, and although her recent music hasn’t best showcased her range, this album is a subtle reminder from Grande that she could make whatever kind of music she wants — and therefore that she is creating the music she wants to create. Grande’s vocal capabilities are highlighted throughout the album, but her talent is especially revealed by those unique whistle-tones she can produce.
The album concludes with a song of self-reflection titled “pov” (or point of view). Grande expresses that she wishes she could view herself the way her lover views her — seeing all the beauty that her partner sees. This song, along with the opener, are perfect bookends to the album; — they express two of the more important topics that Grande wants to explore. By combining the pop style that is apparent throughout the album with a more orchestral, symphonic accompaniment, she seems to announce the two songs’ importance. The songs’ placement at the start and end of a fun, free-form album further signal their significance.
Thematically, Grande has returned with another album of hope, comforting fans with an assurance that a challenging couple of years have truly helped her grow. In that vein, then, “Positions” is an exploration into healing and her anxiety about finding new love. Beyond the more serious notes of her betterment, the atmosphere of the album is playful, exciting, and, most importantly, entertaining. This album is consistent with the abundance of music that Grande has released throughout the last two years, but there is a shift in the construction of this album that resembles her earlier work. Much of her early work emphasized her vocals as well as her unique and diverse melodies, just as some of the songs on this album do.
Some of the songs in the middle of the album do sound similar to one another, which can lead to a listening experience akin to listening to one long song. That song, however, is a good one. Although it can feel like a run-on sentence at times, that run-on is delightfully crafted, engaging, and overall entertaining. Grande knows how to write an album that keeps audiences listening and that’s just what she’s done here. All in all, “Positions” is a slow-burner that begs for repeat listens — whether to discover the stories Grande is telling or simply to vibe with her myriad of diversified, captivating, and memorable melodies.

When the Kid LAROI released his debut mixtape in July 2020, it made a noticeable splash in the music world. In particular, Spotify took notice of the Sydney-raised artist and recruited him to the Spotify RADAR program for up and coming artists. With acknowledgement from such a pillar of 21st century streaming, there was no question that the Australian artist was making a name for himself. Now, with the deluxe release of his “F*CK LOVE (SAVAGE)” mixtape, the Kid has asserted his place in the music industry at the crossroads of hip hop, trap, and pop.
Charlton Kenneth Jeffrey Howard, or “the Kid,” as the 17-year-old’s fans call him, has managed to put an original spin on many of the sounds that you’d expect to find in a contemporary hip hop album. There are less hard rapping pieces with an aggressive beat; instead, the record is interspersed with an impressive, emotional lyricism that elevates him above many other younger artists.
With thematic nods to the late Juice WRLD, one of the Kid’s friends and supporters in the industry, LAROI makes his mark without discrediting his history. By acknowledging his influencers and still making something distinctly his own, LAROI collabed with an incredible array of artists on this album: YoungBoy Never Broke Again, Internet Mondey, Marshmello, Machine Gun Kelly, Lil Mosey, Corbin, and of course, Juice WRLD. Simultaneously taking advantage of the name recognition brought by these well-known artists, but also firmly using their distinct history and approach to bolster his growing style, the Kid shows that he has the wherewithal to collaborate with the greats in the industry.
As listeners dive deeper into the Kid’s unique sound throughout this album, there are the distinct traces of Juice, but plenty of his own voice, too. Given LAROI’s age, it would have been easy for the record to feel immature and unpolished, but even before his opportunities at Columbia Records, he managed to create a distinct and fully matured album. Using a well-curated combination of raw vocals, a smooth beat and a hard-hitting vocal track with varied instrumentals, he emphasizes the suite of emotions throughout, creating an end result that feels full-matured despite being his first mixtape. LAROI’S penchant for genre-hopping only adds to the record and keeps it both intriguing and easy to listen to.
Although common, the Kid’s take on teenage heartbreak in “F*CK LOVE (SAVAGE)” takes its own approach by highlighting LAROI’S flops and capitalizing on his experience. There’s no doubt that the material is more relevant than ever with an at-home, eager-to-listen teen audience, but the album as a whole paints a picture of heartbreak through the eyes of a Kid. Heartbreak and breakup albums aren’t unique in and of themselves. The Kid LAROI’s approach, however, is completely his own. Without much thought, some songs on the album could slide through a (COVID-compliant) party playlist. Songs like “WRONG (feat. Lil Mosey),” “ALWAYS DO,” or “GO (feat. Juice WRLD)” add lighter tones to the album, bringing in a positive beat and sound that mask its more emotional side. Things become somber with “TELL ME WHY” as LAROI attempts to ponder why his friend and mentor Juice WRLD had to die so young. Exploring the dangers of drug abuse rampant in a quarantined, depressed world, the song does a little more than just present raw emotion; it has a real message. All in all, the album presents itself mostly as a story of loss as a kid in his teens “f*cks” up a relationship and watches a girl he loved walk out the door.
As a whole, “F*CK LOVE” is an impressive achievement for a 17-year-old artist: both an astounding tribute to the late Juice WRLD and a clear testament to LAROI’s own musical finesse. Although lacking some of the deeper, more complex ideology of pinnacle rap and hip hop albums such as Kendrick Lamar’s “To Pimp a Butterfly,” the Kid’s first commercial mixtape has all the technical aspects — sound mixing, emotion, pace — of any great album. As his career continues, it will be incredible to watch the progress of an artist who dropped such a chart-topping, astounding first mixtape.

There is no doubt that Ty Dolla $ign is as talented as they come. No matter what hat he’s wearing — producer, vocalist, or collaborator — Ty’s artistic genius shines. In his album “Featuring Ty Dolla Sign,” he furthers that impressive range and calls attention to a slew of impressive collaborations, enhancing each track with signature vocal backings catered to its featured artist. Unfortunately, in the process of adapting to other artists’ energies, his own sound takes the backseat and his lyrical genius is given little space to shine.
It’s a shame, because the project as a whole is a clear attempt by Ty to take his sound to the next level and evolve beyond the same mainstream concepts. The busyness of the 25 tracks and the influence of various featured artists, however, overwhelm that agenda.
Perhaps counterintuitively, the album’s first two songs contain no features. “Intro” and “Status” take the leap into a more self-reflective vibe, introducing an essential theme of this album: “It's time to wake they ass up” to Ty. This sets up the angle that the music industry needs Ty, not the other way around. That motif carries over to solo tracks like “Return” and “serpentwithfeet Interlude,” which grapple with great expectations and preach a renewed sense of purpose, emphasized by the serenading spirituality of the vocals. Whether it’s due to Ty’s own aspirations or the words of Kanye West urging him “Dolla, you too good to put your voice on that generic shit,” the message remains clear — whether it’s a music project or a whole career, have the confidence to take things to the next level.
There are few tracks which reach that objective. R&B jams like “Lift Me Up,” “Your Turn,” and “By Yourself” are the rare examples on this record where Ty’s voice is center stage, and the artists around him create a balanced harmony that complements his sound: guitar riffs guided by gentle 808’s accompany the classic Ty flow brimming with runs, vocalizations, and harmonies. Serving to elevate his sound, these hidden gems are scattered few and far between.
This vibe comes into conflict with another common theme of the album: trying to appeal to many audiences.
Many different sounds and flows take the spotlight in the party bop side of this record. Hype beats and fast tempos dominate tracks like “Spicy,” where Ty accommodates the rock mellow vibes of Post Malone to recreate something reminiscent of their previous collaboration, “Psycho.” It comes as a shock to no one that “Track 6” and “Tyrone 2021” also went straight into the mainstream, since they are heavily swayed to the singular vibes of icons like Anderson .Paak and Big Sean. The club-type bangers “Ego Death” and “Expensive” quickly rose to fame as well, once again heavily influenced by the individualistic styles of artists like Kanye West and Nicki Minaj. Although it garners Ty some instant hits, these tracks create a push and pull in different directions, mixing various sounds past the point of no semblance of commonality.
The fast track to fame has another downside; it comes at the price of downplaying Ty’s sound, which makes these tracks incongruous with the apparent objective of this work.
Not only does the rapper’s voice get lost in the process of stretching himself too thin to appeal to different genres, but the busyness of the album stems from that problem as well. The soulfulness of “Temptations” clashes with the saccharine romanticism of “Universe” and has no connection to the striking social commentary in “Real Life.” Together, they have no connection to the album’s larger message. While it is impressive to see such a diversity of sound jammed into one record, it is not executed cohesively enough to be considered part of a larger thematic work.
While there is not a whole lot of time invested in establishing a correspondence throughout the album, it is far from being a failure. “Featuring Ty Dolla Sign” did not break away from the mainstream, but neither did it miss the mark. The transitions between tracks exemplify Ty’s top-tier production, and the household names help to propel it straight to chart-topping success. Regardless of its route to success, the lengthy album has a handful of songs worth revisiting: party-starters guaranteed to make it to every self-respecting DJ’s booth.

Since their last album and the beginning of quarantine, British girl group Little Mix has been busy. While “LM5” might not have been a smash success, “Sweet Melody” signals a return t0 form as the latest in a series of newly-mature hit singles.
Despite their departure from Syco Music, Little Mix have not faltered — winning another Brit Award for Best British Video with “Woman Like Me” feat. Nicki Minaj. Little Mix’s newer advance singles released in the run-up to their sixth studio album “Confetti” gave listeners a taste of their new sound to come. “Break Up Song” — which was promoted entirely online due to the pandemic — and “Holiday,” both released earlier this year, were upbeat and catchy, with effective and experimental production, even if some of their messages don’t mesh so well with a world in the midst of a pandemic.
Throughout October, “Mixers,” as Little Mix fans term themselves, were inundated with exciting new content. “Not a Pop Song,” released on Oct. 9, features an energetic strumming guitar and shouty chorus, surely crafted to be a crowd pleaser even without a crowd. In the same way, “Happiness,” released on Oct. 15 continues the trend of being upbeat with the beautiful harmonies Little Mix is known for.
Now, “Sweet Melody” deviates from the norm while cementing Little Mix’s sound. It’s got the feel-good dancing beat that embodies the quintessential pop Little Mix excels at. It’s maturer than some of their bigger hits like “Black Magic” and “Touch” without being as explicit as “Joan of Arc” or “Bounce Back.” It’s got the intensity of “Power” without trying so hard. And even among their latest singles, “Sweet Melody” is a blend of the best of their albums. It’s got the self-assurance “Salute” hoped for as they eased away from their X-Factor sound, the romantic authenticity of “Glory Days” when they found their stride, and the maturity of “LM5.”
“Sweet Melody” begins with Jesy crooning a pretty staccato refrain without lyrics — a sweet melody, if you will. The story is a typical one for Little Mix, featuring a relationship with a guy who they had strong feelings for, and then their reflections on their behaviour before the guy did them wrong. While the subject matter isn’t groundbreaking, the mesh of the best of all their preceding albums, lovely melodies (ha!) and creative production choices all form an evocative entry into the pop genre.
Sonic quirks also elevate “Sweet Melody.” When Leigh-Anne sings “But I stopped in my tracks” the backing track completely stops for a beat of silence. Moreover, they employ a play on words in the chorus: where Jesy, Perrie, Jade and Leigh-Anne sing about how “he used to sing me sweet melodies,” the “sing me” sounds more like “save me” which adds a nice subtext, as by singing about this bad boyfriend at all they betray a lingering nostalgia.
Little Mix always excel at both group harmonies and individual belts, and their newest track is no exception. Interestingly, in a break from tradition, instead of giving out a solo to one of the four group members in the final third, all four take turns providing the alternative melodies and “wow notes.” This elevates “Sweet Melody” beyond any of Little Mix’s more formulaic entries to the pop genre as they remind listeners why remaining a girl group even after nine years is a strength and a choice they’re happy with, not a pitstop on the way to lackluster solo careers. The advanced singles of Little Mix’s sixth album have shown a return to their romantic pop roots while showcasing more experimental production and feel-good cohesive melodies.

Even after 25 years, the Boston-based indie band, Dispatch, continues to break new ground with their music. “Phase 1,” their most recent release, is the first installment of five releases, which will make up Dispatch’s eighth studio album. The five phases of Dispatch’s new album are meant to follow the five stages of grief and transition — meaning that “Phase 1” is about denial and isolation. Dispatch identifies the problems facing current-day America, including racial justice, gender inequality, political discord, and the coronavirus pandemic, and tackles them head on. “Phase 1” pinpoints the overwhelming malaise many Americans are experiencing in these tumultuous times, hinting at a hopeful future.
While taking a political stand, Dispatch also manages to produce top-notch and original music. The brilliantly smithed lyrics roll off the tongue, without clotting the flow of energetic, feel-good rhythms and catchy choruses. The songs in “Phase 1” are consistent with Dispatch’s past work. Although each of the songs vary in tone, they all bear that trademark Dispatch sound — a blend of rock, folk, and reggae.
“May We All” is the first track on “Phase 1,” and it sets a strong tone for the album. The song is driven by a fast rock beat that is somehow also laid back, creating a sound that is reminiscent of their past songs, “Painted Yellow Lines” and “Letter to Lady J.” The lyrics of “May We All” similarly set a strong foundation for the message of “Phase 1.” Going into the chorus, Dispatch sings, “I stubbed my toe / And I wanted to blame the roots of the trees / For pushing up the concrete, but now I know / May we all be forsaken / Like the black man trying to breathe, or the woman that’s never believed / May we all be mistaken / About our current state, about our current of hate.” Here, the speaker begins with a tale of denial, blaming a tree for stubbing his toe. In the last two lines, he questions whether we’re all mistaken about our tense political climate. Placed side by side, these lyrics expose the fact that many Americans blame anything and everything for political turmoil — but rarely stop to look at themselves. Dispatch, then, asks the listener to do just that: to look introspectively and identify their own hate and denial. Like a stubbed toe, we must accept blame ourselves, and heal with time. The speaker also singles out a widespread feeling of isolation with the line, “may we all be forsaken,” and goes on to acknowledge the struggle of those affected by racial and gender inequality, — issues discussed in their previous album, “Location 13.” Full of meaning and groove, “May We All” is a near flawless start to Dispatch’s latest album.
The second song on “Phase 1,” titled “All This Time,” is a collaboration with singer/songwriter The White Buffalo. “All This Time” is slower and much more somber than “May We All,” bringing out the folk and blues side of Dispatch’s sound. “All This Time” bears a strong social message, hitting home with these concluding lines: “All this time we pledge allegiance to the tune of a thousand treasons / One nation under something, under water, under mass incarceration / In the age of feast and famine can we disrupt the social canon / Let our children lead, we all believe, let us see the forest for the trees.” The first line here calls out American hypocrisy — a kind of treason against our own core beliefs. America was built on the idea of freedom, and yet the speaker dubs it a nation “under mass incarceration.” The “age of feast and famine” that we are living in is clearly a moniker for the wealth gap. In the last line here, the speaker begs the listener to step out of his or her state of denial, to stop blindly pledging allegiance, and to “see the forest for the trees.” If the forest is America, each tree is an individual American. Dispatch pointedly asks their listeners to fight for each other’s individual freedom.
The final track on “Phase 1” is “One by One,” and it elevates the mood after “All This Time.” The song starts off with a moderate ska tempo and later settles into more laid-back summer reggae. “One by One” is a tribute to someone who meant a lot to the speaker, but is no longer in his life. With an uplifting sound and an uplifting message, “One by One” rounds out the heavier elements of “Phase 1.”
Once again, Dispatch has delivered razor-sharp lyrics and infectious tunes. “Phase 1” is a promising first installment for Dispatch’s newest album.

Three years, ten single releases, and two album delays later, English singer-songwriter Sam Smith finally released their long-awaited third studio album “Love Goes” on Oct. 30. Originally scheduled to be released on May 1 under the name “To Die For,” “Love Goes” is well-worth the added wait.
The album’s opener, “Young,” is a 2.5-minute a cappella track on which Smith sings completely alone — an unexpected, yet ultimately rewarding, choice by a singer who is primarily known for piano-heavy ballads and gospel-style backup vocals. Because “Young” is a change from Smith’s usual style and because Smith sings unaccompanied, the track captivates audiences and leaves them with no choice but to listen to every effortless and beautiful word. “Young” not only captures listeners’ attention, it leaves them ready for the rest of the album — excited for what’s to come.
In an interview with Apple Music about “Love Goes,” regarding “Young,” Smith said, “This isn't going to be an album of only uptempo pop. I’m still the person who was writing sad love songs.” And this is true. “Love Goes” has quite a few sad love songs — the types of ballads that fans of Smith’s earlier works have come to expect. Despite the exclamation that this album isn’t entirely uptempo pop, however, there is still a fair amount of the style featured on the album.
“Dance (‘Til You Love Someone Else)” exemplifies Smith’s successful integration of uptempo pop into their album. As the name suggests, “Dance (‘Til You Love Someone Else)” is a dance track. With its quick-building first verse, funky electronic beat, and repetitive chorus, this song is the perfect club anthem. Despite its departure from Smith’s usual style, this song, as well as the other uptempo pop tracks found later on the album like “How Do You Sleep” and “Promises (with Calvin Harris),” demonstrates Smith’s ability to create songs that aren’t sad ballads but still connect well with their audiences.
Smith’s growth as an artist and the worthwhile risks they chose to take on this album are best exemplified on the titular track, “Love Goes (feat. Labrinth).” The song starts off simply enough — after a minute-long soft piano melody, Labrinth sings the first verse and chorus in his soft, smooth, R&B-style voice. Smith then joins the song to sing the second verse and chorus, with subtle but tantalizing harmonies by Labrinth. The pair’s voices work effortlessly together as they sing the chorus’s simple yet weighty lyrics “‘Cause that’s how love goes / That’s how love goes (goes).” Everything changes when, about two-thirds of the way in, the song abruptly transitions from a sad ballad into horn-filled fanfare — another unexpected choice by Smith. Suddenly, the two singers are accompanied by horns, strings, and a hip-hop-esque beat as they sing, “That’s how love goes.” And as quickly as the theatrical instruments joined the second, they disappear, and a soothing string orchestra closes out the song. Much like the album, “Love Goes (feat. Labrinth)” takes listeners on a musical journey. The shifts in the song mirror the shifts in Smith’s musical style that are represented throughout the entire collection.
While there are no songs on “Love Goes” that fail to exemplify Smith’s incredible talent, the last six songs of the album  — all of which are bonus tracks — detract from the cohesive journey of the album rather than add to it. These tracks, much like with the album as a whole, are each different from the last and are undeniably good compositions. Each one was also a single released ahead of the album. This, however, is not the actual issue; singers release singles to build anticipation for their albums all the time. The problem is that each of these singles have been out for a long time. For example, “Dancing With A Stranger (with Normani)” was released on Jan. 11, 2019 and “To Die For,” one of the most recent singles, was released Feb. 14. Because big fans of Smith listened to these songs repeatedly as they waited for the release of the album, the last third of the album feels boring and unsurprising — very different feelings than the ones of surprise and excitement evoked by the first 11 tracks.
Despite the drawbacks of the bonus tracks (which are still great songs), “Love Goes” remains a remarkable album. The LP both represents a shift in Smith’s style as a musician and showcases what they are known for and do best. Smith shows off their newfound versatility as an artist previously only known for sad ballads by creating fun, upbeat, danceable tracks. Both seasoned fans of Smith who fell in love with their heart-wrenching love ballads and newer, casual listeners of the singer who enjoy their new, uptempo discopop tracks are bound to appreciate this album.

This past July, I frantically scrolled through AirBnb, scouring the website for apartments or houses. Though I’d considered Zillow, Apartments.com, or other sites that would offer a broader selection, the moment called for speed and convenience. Cambridge, Brighton, Allston — virtually every town in the greater Boston area graced my search bar. Finally, I landed upon an image of a towering, bright blue building glinting in the sunlight:
“The Penthouse Redline | 2BR 1 BA | Walk to the Redline for UMass and Mass General!”
My eyes darted to the rent; a gray, striked-out number gave way to a cheaper price. I skimmed the amenities list, breathing a sigh of relief at the washer and dryer. Scanning a slew of glowing reviews started to solidify my attachment toward the location. Finally, I glanced at the map at the bottom of the page, registering the parks, beach, and shopping areas nearby. I barely noticed “Dorchester,” written in faded text. I copied the page link into a message and hit send to my group chat, hoping that I’d found exactly what I was looking for.

Immediately after learning Harvard wouldn’t let upperclassmen back on campus for the fall, I, like many, began weighing my options. Do I continue with classes or do I take time off to preserve as many on-campus semesters as I can? A flurry of texts, frantic calls, and long talks with my parents soon revealed that a happy medium might be possible: living in Boston with friends while attending online classes.
It seemed ideal: I could alleviate the loneliness that hung in the silence I heard after logging off of every Zoom call. The overall cost of living would be less than paying for Harvard’s room and board. An added bonus were the “adulting” skills I might gain — the cooking, cleaning, budgeting, and organizing prowess that my mom always told me I lacked. And I would be living in Boston, where I could bridge the physical distance that separated me from my college friends and possibly create a partial substitute for the junior fall I desired.
After another week of urgent Zoom calls, we formed a group, nervously anticipating our first stint at adulthood. But the process proved more difficult than anticipated. Unexpectedly, we were seriously advised against the location, with family members warning us about Dorchester. They cited crime rates and personal anecdotes, the concerns alleviated only after one of our roommates — who went to high school within walking distance of the apartment — vouched for the area’s safety.
Still, even with our main concerns resolved, one of my friends was unconvinced. As we perused the area around the apartment on Google Maps, a few things caught his attention — a Gem Auto Parts and Mass Motor Services on the same road as our building, a car dealership down the street, and another auto repair shop less than half a mile away. He smirked and said, “You know what it means when there are a lot of car shops around?”
I looked up in confusion. “No, what are you talking about?”
“It means people want to leave.” He eventually decided to live at home.

My roommates and I hauled our belongings up three flights of stairs in early September. We set up our workspaces, established a cooking and cleaning schedule, and wholeheartedly embraced our new independence — we went on a group run, cooked together, and held weekly game nights. One Friday evening, we lugged a table and four chairs across our balcony and up the stairs to our roof. Together we ate a dinner lit only by a Nalgene water bottle placed on top of a smartphone flashlight and the twinkle of the Boston skyline beyond our railing.
We never found the time to reenact that meal over the months that followed. But that experience encompassed my hopes and expectations for the semester — the companionship, the self-sufficiency, the proximity to the city.
In September, my editor reached out to me about co-writing a cover story about the effect of Harvard students moving into homes in the greater Boston area for the fall, as many tried to maintain ties to campus after being denied entry — just as I did. I agreed, feeling that my personal insight might add more to the piece. But as our research and reporting continued, our angle shifted; there was new information to reconcile.
Landlords, we learned, were losing business. As the number of empty units in the city increased, they slashed rents and made leases easier to obtain. When Boston’s moratorium on evictions expired in October, thousands of families were at risk losing their homes. Housing advocates told us that without significant help, as many as 250,000 people could fall far enough behind on rent that they would be left homeless in the winter months, a situation only worsened by the pandemic.
The takeaway of our reporting was clear: As the housing market tanked, I had scored an apartment for cheap. And I remembered scrolling past pages of discounted Airbnb prices, pleasantly surprised at the lower numbers but never curious about their origin.
After writing that piece, I started to notice more. I noticed that the bustling plaza two streets away filled with restaurants and shops barely blocked a string of warehouses from view. The first time I drove by, I snickered at the fluorescent signs that boasted names like “Mutual Beef” and “Lord Jeff,” but later I started to wonder at the duality of my new neighborhood. And when we ordered food from a restaurant where the price of half the entrees soared past $20, I remembered driving by a sidewalk barely five minutes from our home filled with people leaning against their belongings or settling onto the ground for the night, their outlines silhouetted by the flashing blue lights of the police car behind them.
Just as our piece revealed that the “Harvard bubble” was more porous than we had thought, my own idyllic housing bubble popped. As much as I’d like to call myself innocent, I benefited from the phenomenon that has — and will — cause thousands of people grief. I thought back to my friend’s line and realized that I had tried so hard to see only the parts of the community that might make people stay — and ignored the ones that might push them out.
While writing that article, I interviewed Kiah D. Duggins, the president of the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau. When she spoke to me, she emphasized that Harvard students need to remain humble and take action to help the communities that surround them. I’m still wrestling with that question of action. I understand the need to remain conscious of our impact on the communities around campus — we don’t just arrive in September and leave in May without a trace. But despite my discomfort at benefiting from the consequences of a housing crisis, it’s hard to imagine what type of meaningful action I — or any student — could even take.
For now, maybe the best we can do is stay conscious, protecting ourselves from the danger of forgetting about the world outside the Yard and the Square.

College was over the minute my dad walked into my dorm in March. The room — by now restored to its original state — was too barren and impersonal to stir up any deep sorrow. My roommate had left a few days before, and I cried to see her go. My dad, the eternal optimist, in cargo shorts and a polo, greeted me with a hug. He surveyed warped floorboards, the furniture, the small bathroom, as empty as the day he moved me in. This is where my daughter has been, I imagined him thinking.
I was suddenly choked up. His presence felt like it was drawing back the curtain on some shadow world, as if I had been up to something nefarious. He looked at me with all the weight of paternal hope and expectation, and I geared up for the inevitable query: “So, how was it?”
We shuttled boxes to his car. Once my college experience was packed and secured to the roof with twine, I hopped in the car without hesitation. “Is there anyone you want to say goodbye to?” There wasn’t. Acquaintances, sure, but seeking them out for a tearful goodbye seemed about as genuine as promising to grab a meal sometime.
On the drive home, the few square miles where I’d spent the past six months of my life blurred by in just a few minutes. My dad put on a CD and handed me a packed lunch. As I ate, I scrolled through tearful farewell posts on Instagram with a straight face, finally able to admit my sadness was mostly vicarious and tempered with undeniable relief.

“Let’s grab a meal sometime.”
How many times did I hear this phrase last year? A benevolent proposition anywhere else, at Harvard, it’s become a nicety at best, and a symbol of everything wrong with social life on campus at worst.
Roey L. Leonardi ’23, a Crimson staff writer, readily admits she was a serial user of this phrase, or a variant of it, on campus. “Oh my gosh, we should get lunch,” she says in a high-pitched voice, mocking herself. She admits she rarely followed up on her invitations.
When I ask why, she admits to feeling “that those types of interactions were insincere,” and assuming “people aren’t really interested in my time, or me.” She adds a quick disclaimer: “Or maybe that’s a personal issue I have.”
Although we’re on The Crimson together, this Zoom interview is our first one-on-one conversation. It’s surprising to hear her doubt whether she’s worth anyone’s time. A well-dressed English concentrator, on campus she came across as witty and put-together — in my eyes, objectively interesting. I never guessed she felt insecure. Her words resonate with me, and I wonder: Why didn’t we grab a meal on campus?
Over the many months of quarantine, I sift through campus memories, trying to pinpoint what went wrong. Many of them center around Annenberg. When I first toured Harvard in high school, I was enthralled by Annenberg’s towering spire and stained glass windows, but even more so by what I imagined to be inside: brilliant students at Hogwarts-esque long tables, embroiled in intellectual conversations. The fact that the interior was off-limits to tours only heightened my romantic visions and fuelled my desire to get in.
My high school experience was an extended exercise in delayed gratification. The daily grind of classes and extracurriculars was made palatable only by the utopian vision of a better college experience — lifelong friends, world-class resources, learning for learning’s sake. Receiving my Harvard acceptance letter felt like an implicit agreement: I’d done the work to get in, and in exchange, I’d be guaranteed access to the “transformative power” of a Harvard education, as the College often advertises. But most enticing to me was the school’s promise that I’d belong. “Home at Harvard,” reads Harvard’s website.
PAFs and advisors all spoke glowingly of Annenberg: a place where you could sit down with strangers and, after a meal, have found a new friend. In those first weeks, I tried that strategy. And in retrospect, those conversations weren’t all bad. But they weren’t perfect either. Often the conversation would start with an exchange of information — hometown, concentration, extracurriculars — and then descend into a tense silence.
By Thanksgiving, this no longer seemed like an option. I’d go to Annenberg for lunch, step out of the servery with my plastic tray, and scan the rows of tables for a familiar face. Too afraid to sit with a stranger, I’d trudge to a table in the back and try to look busy, or dramatically gaze up at the stained glass windows and remind myself how lucky I was just to be there. Internally, I’d smile bitterly at how cliché it all was, how this was middle school shit. And I was convinced I was the only one.
My time on campus wasn’t bad, necessarily, but upon leaving, I felt dissatisfied — particularly socially. I had expected the admissions-brochure promise of lifelong friends and a community I knew I belonged in. Instead, finding friends felt like work. I made a few, but mostly made acquaintances I knew I wouldn’t keep in touch with after leaving campus. I spent a lot of time alone in my dorm, feeling like I was missing something, but not sure where to find it.
To be fair, coming in with such high expectations was a recipe for disappointment. I also had some bad luck: a missed pre-orientation deadline, a tricky rooming situation, and a truncated year due to the pandemic. But I can’t help but wonder if there’s something inherent to Harvard that makes connection so hard.

Noah D. Dasanaike ’22, a Crimson Editorial editor, is an advocate for unstructured time. When we meet on Zoom at 3 p.m., he’s just rolled out of bed — unclear whether from a nap or a full night’s rest. When Noah got to Harvard, he remembers being surprised by just how busy everyone was. “I never thought I would ever meet people who schedule their free time in the calendar,” he remarks, laughing. “That was just insane to me.”
It’s my first time meeting Noah, and he comes across as friendly and laid-back. During our entire half-hour conversation, a smile never leaves his face. I ask him what he’s most looking forward to upon returning to campus, and he talks animatedly about hanging out at El Jefe’s with friends.
But on campus, he struggled to find others who shared his easy-going demeanor. He had trouble finding friends who were willing to hang out and weren’t “afraid of having free time.” As he sums it up, “the vibe was off.”
I realize, somewhat sheepishly, that I’d internalized that fear of free time while I was on campus. Or, more accurately, that guilt. In high school, I pretty much never had free time. When I did in college, I felt like I wasn’t doing enough or was being left behind. That’s another reason I never actually grabbed a meal with someone — one of us was always too busy.
That Harvard students care about their grades is no surprise. But the College markets the romantic idea that most learning happens outside the classroom, during precisely the unstructured time Noah claims most students fear. It’s a Convocation trope to mention those conversations in Annenberg, or those late-night debates in a friend’s dorm, as the sites of true education. But during my free time on campus, I found that supposed spontaneity glaringly absent. Where was I to find these free-spirited people to converse or debate with?
Jessica F. Wu ’23, a friend of mine, remembers feeling “pressured” to join pre-professional organizations during her first year. Hoping to find community, she instead found more work and a unpleasantly competitive atmosphere. “There’s a sense of competitiveness, because now for the first time, you’re surrounded by people who have the same interest,” she says. “I think it’s hard to let those guards down.”
For my part, I had never heard of consulting groups before college. Although I didn’t actually join them, I still felt their power. During the past couple months, my inbox has been flooded with emails from LinkedIn, asking me to congratulate distant acquaintances on their new positions at various finance and consulting firms. Sometimes I can’t help but Google how much their positions pay and let the shock run over me before switching tabs back to my journalism internship applications.
But even for those in non-pre-professional organizations, finding community can still be a challenge. Roey, an aspiring writer, hoped to find her place in literary organizations on campus, but was unprepared for “how many hoops you have to jump through just to do something you care about.” These hoops are called “comps,” essentially a semester-long application process for acceptance into an organization. Although some are completion-based, many make cuts.
Socializing during these comp processes — “bullshitting for approval,” as Roey describes it — can often be too goal-oriented to allow for real connection, both with other compers and with upperclassmen. “It felt like I had to prove myself constantly, rather than being wanted or welcomed,” Roey remembers.
Noah credits this environment of competition to the people Harvard attracts. Extracurricular ambitions, he says, are an example of students “existing for the sake of what [they] think [they] could achieve in the future,” rather than prioritizing enjoyment in the present. He feels lucky to have found friends early on who value chilling at El Jefe’s as much as he does, but admits he’s struggled to make new friends who share those values. Harvard students, he says, “are very much accustomed to looking ahead.”
Noah’s words remind me of another Annenberg memory. On the rare occasion I did catch a meal with a friend, I found it hard to focus. Perhaps it was the background noise or the high ceilings, but for whatever reason, I struggled to maintain eye contact. My eyes would flick away, left, right, always scanning, always comparing. Who just walked in? What are they laughing about? What do people think of me right now? And not infrequently I’d catch my companion doing the same. We’d sit there, grateful not to be alone, but not really present, one eye perpetually fixed on some made-up horizon.

After family dinner, I curl up under the duvet I chose from IKEA in ninth grade, next to my stuffed animal. The suburban street is quiet outside my window. When I open Zoom, my friend has my undivided attention. It’s trendy to complain about Zoom — its lag time, its choppy audio, human beings reduced to 2-D rectangles. And sure, it’s imperfect, but for me, Zoom has enabled an intentionality I longed for on campus: We’ve carved out this time for each other.
I talk to my sources for this article over Zoom. I turn off self-view, make them full-screen, and don’t open any other tabs. Though some of them are acquaintances, this conversation is the realest we’ve had, on-campus or off. It’s only near the end of the conversation that Zoom starts to feel restrictive. In person, we might sit in the afterglow for a while, feeling the new closeness. But on Zoom, we sign off quickly. I want to give them all hugs.
If and when we return to campus, the physical structures of Harvard will still be in place. Annenberg, with its long tables and high ceilings. Extracurricular activities, with their long-established comp processes. And students, with their ambitions and dreams. But I’m hopeful that something will change. After a year of distance and computer screens, perhaps Harvard students will come to value time with others more highly. On their packed list of priorities, maybe genuine social interaction will move up a few spots.
When Jessica comes back to campus, she wants to start over. She intends to prioritize social events over pre-professional ones and even over studying. She proposes everyone “mutually agree that it’s fine to ask people to hang out.” Noah wants to finally get that El Jefe’s with his friends. Roey plans to actually “make good” on her lunch invitations.
I’ve begun imagining what that first conversation on campus will be like. Perhaps it’ll be with a trusted friend, and we’ll hug, a little rusty, a little giddy. Or perhaps it’ll be with a semi-stranger. There will be that moment of recognition, remembering the other exists, takes up space; we’ll laugh about it. But it’s in that next moment, those seconds that stretch the bounds of common courtesy, that we’ll discover if anything has changed. Maybe we’ll grab a meal, or maybe we’ll keep walking.

I waited four and a half hours at the DMV, and all I got was a plastic card. But that plastic card was all I needed, all I could ever want — it was my ticket out of the New Jersey suburbs, allowing me to reach my destinations by the fastest route possible.
I blended in easily on the road: Ever since I was little, I would shove down the rest of a takeout lunch or read the last few chapters of a book as my family carted me from city to city, rushing to finish our list of errands. Forty-five minutes on I-78 takes you to bustling New York City for a recital: check. Twenty minutes on I-287 brings you to a mall: check. Ten minutes on U.S. Highway 22 drops you at a Costco and the Asian supermarket: check. Time was always ticking, appointments were waiting, the distance was maddening. Piling into a car and lurching onward became the solution.
Life was reduced to a series of points, and I was eager to connect them in the fewest number of moves possible.
As I left New Jersey for college, I was more than ready to leave the wash of green trees and rolling hills behind for glittering Boston and buzzing Harvard Square. The city held an endless number of things to do, and the T pass was my new ticket to freedom, whizzing me from museums to restaurants and back to campus.
I took pride in my carefully color-coded Google Calendar, bursting at the seams with office hours, classes, and meetings. While scheduled appointments painted my calendar into the rainbow, the unscheduled white space reserved for meals and walking time threatened to tear the rainbow apart.
So I took no chances. Meals squeezed in as I swerved through Annenberg, more often than not running out with a bagged lunch. Lunch was a cold caprese wrapped in one hand as I scrolled through a textbook with another, the green pesto juice oozing into the clear plastic wrap. The Yard shrunk into the few paths of least resistance that I could cover in minutes with long strides, head down to skim an email and mind alert to race through a to-do list.
I felt alive. Classes and meetings and opportunities and success just couldn’t wait.
But in March, at the start of the pandemic, it all had to be put on hold. Back at home, I sat at my desk as the world grinded to a halt. The rainbow blocks of my Google Calendar peeled off to an empty white.
I wrestled with the distance, the time. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner as full sit-down meals with my family set my fingers drumming, eyes flickering, and feet tapping. But as much as I tried to fill the white space with to-dos, it lingered and left faded trails of the life that had been. Those blank slivers in my schedule once stood for M2 shuttle runs or brisk walks to CVS to run a few errands, but now they’d multiplied and expanded into hours of emptiness.
As days and nights passed, I shifted uneasily in my childhood bedroom seat. I had no more colors to splash on the blank canvas my calendar had become, and I realized I was fighting a battle I couldn’t win. Life could no longer run at breakneck speed with no destination in sight. The accelerator was hopelessly broken, and I felt unproductive and unsuccessful.
When my parents suggested we take daily walks together as a family early in the morning, I leapt at the opportunity — here was another chance to fill up my day. But as the walks swung unpredictably from 20 minutes to a full hour, as we wandered from one end of the neighborhood to the next, baking under the hot Jersey sun, the walks became more than just another invite in the Calendar.
Life was expanded to include the routes between.
White space on the Calendar transformed into deep breaths, long walks, and open conversations. Gold, bronze, and red leaves dancing in the wind and later settling in the grass; a shelf of wavy fungi encircling a tree right by the main road; a squirrel sitting back on its hind legs munching on an acorn — the smallest observations took time, but, scattered in every walk, they were beautiful to behold. All this had been invisible when driving from point A to B for most of my life, yet here they were, right under my nose and clearer than ever.
Mental space, too, shifted. Space originally allocated for simultaneously checking an email, walking straight ahead, and listening to music was cleared away for conversations about long-term dreams and aspirations, values, and goals.
I was taking in the world around me, finally slowing down to link snippets of thoughts together into coherent musings. These reflections influenced and better informed decisions like choosing classes and deciding how to spend my Saturday afternoons. The white space was formally empty, but never had it been so full of substance and time to process and recharge.
Time ticks on, the notification goes off, and we may fall back — and that’s okay.

This wasn’t how I expected to spend my 21st birthday. But it was October, and given the lockdowns, pickings for a venue were slim. I’ve never been good at making decisions, and I certainly wasn’t going to start now — so I searched “restaurants near me” on Google and chose the closest one.
My friends and I loaded into the car and drove off into the night. We got on I-195 and pulled up to our destination.
“I didn’t even know this place still existed,” I told my friends as we got out of the car. “All the ones near me have closed.”
“I wonder why,” one of my friends mumbled back, clearly annoyed by Google’s choice.
Masks covering our faces, we entered Applebee’s.

Growing up, I trained myself to expect things to be bad so that I’d never be disappointed. At worst, I told myself, I’d have a bad experience, and at best, I’d be pleasantly surprised. But I’d never risk feeling unfulfilled.
I’ve learned over the years that New Year’s Eve is never as fun as I’d like, for example. Rather than hope that I’ll suddenly feel the magic of the ball drop on my TV screen, I’ve come to accept that if I want to enjoy New Year’s, I need to set low expectations. If I end up having fun, then great — but if not, I can just remind myself that Dec. 31 is no different from any other day.
I’ve used this attitude for a lot of things.
But my friends and family would tell me that if I approached experiences with a bad attitude, of course I’d have a bad experience. Deep down, I must have wanted to believe that they were right — so I decided to take their advice in college: I promised myself that things could live up to my expectations if I went in positive. Throughout high school, I convinced myself that college would be the best four years of my life. I was going to be an engineer. I was going to join the band and know all my professors. I told myself that I would, that I should, be able to find friends like the ones I had at home,that being away from home wouldn’t be hard for me.
But by November of freshman fall, I had switched my major twice and stopped playing the saxophone. Not one professor knew my name. I was homesick.
***
The tables looked like they had been stolen from an abandoned Chili’s; if you dared rest your forearms on their dark surface, they stuck to your skin. The light fixture above my head flickered, adding to the restaurant’s Halloween-themed (I think?) decor. My chair was unsteady, and I rocked back and forth trying to flatten the fourth leg on the crusty checkered floor.
“What’s in the Vampire?” I asked the waitress as she stopped by for our drink orders.
“Vampire is bloody delicious with a mix of rum, strawberry, dragon fruit, passion fruit and a dash of pineapple,” she read to me from their $1 monthly specials drink menu. She quickly remembered to smile at the end.
“I’ll try that,” I told her as I proudly handed over my ID.
When she brought over the drink, the first thing I noticed were the plastic fangs floating at the top — they were impossible to miss. It was certainly unique.
I took out the cherry and took my first sip of the mystic purple mixture.
***
“I can’t believe I set myself up like this,” I whispered to my mom on the phone on a particularly rough November night. Despite her best attempt to cheer me up, I curled up in my miniature Wigglesworth room and went to sleep, vowing to keep my expectations low.
And I did just that.
On housing day, my blocking group got Leverett. “Yes! Not the Quad,” I shouted to my blocking group. Their blank faces showed their obviously mixed emotions; Leverett is consistently rated one of the most average houses. I was ecstatic, though — it could have been worse.
The summer after freshman year, I interned in San Francisco. Before going there, I looked up all the city’s faults: high cost of living, shit on the sidewalks, Cali bros. Despite all of the issues I had discovered preemptively, I loved my experience: the aesthetic, the young population, the craziness of downtown San Francisco, the great internship experience outweighed everything I’d worried about.
My sophomore fall, I scored Red Sox tickets for a really good price. Despite being a huge baseball fan, I still assumed something would go wrong: the seats would have an obstructed view, or my favorite player wouldn’t be in the lineup. When the game was postponed due to rain, I wasn’t surprised. My expectations were set low enough that I was fine with the outcome. I learned to be satisfied with mediocrity.
***
“You’ll always remember your 21st birthday,” my uncle used to joke. “Well, maybe not all of it.”
That’s probably why it’s hard to suppress your excitement for the biggest milestones. There’s more than just your own expectations; there’s external pressure associated with them, too.
I had anticipated my 21st birthday for a while, subconsciously telling myself that it had to be epic and unforgettable.
Yet there I was, sitting in a musky Applebee’s in the middle of a pandemic, feeling that this day, like many others in quarantine, would fade into the unconscious part of my brain, the part filled with faded memories, dullened emotions, and forgotten inside jokes.
In that moment, I began to reflect on my mindset toward expectations. I couldn’t shake the feeling that my attitude somehow impacted my experiences. On one hand, my low expectations offered a way out of ever feeling disappointed, but on the other hand, I stopped myself from feeling any preliminary excitement for anything — and that limit on anticipation seemed to somehow limit the experiences themselves.
Maybe it was all of the extra time I had to think in quarantine — or maybe it was that no matter how low my expectations were, the pandemic still found a way to let me down.
As the world adapts to a new normal, we’ve all had to adjust our expectations. For most, the experiences of the pandemic — virtual graduations, cancelled internships, stay-at-home Friday nights — have probably been a lesson in not expecting too much.
And yet I’ve found myself rethinking this mentality, the same one I had for years employed as a defense mechanism. I realized that expectations can be more than just high and low. They can be optimistic, pessimistic, and realistic. They can be definitive and suggestive. They can be open and they can be closed.
Expectations are a constantly changing measure of the future. Low expectations soften a blow, but they are also a form of resignation, restricting what I can feel not just before, but also during, an event.
By only setting high or low expectations, and then treating that measure of the future as definitive, I didn’t just limit disappointment — I limited the surprise and joy that arise when expectations are, well, wrong.
***
I’ll remember my 21st forever, I think.
Maybe it was something about the building, placed perfectly next to a Walgreens and Big Blue Car Wash, the second “p” in the neon Applebee’s sign flickering between bright and dim. Maybe it was the sticky tables, the flickering lights. Or perhaps it was the four of us wobbling our chairs and laughing our heads off as we played Charades on my phone and talked about how ironic it wais that Al Capone’s brother was a Federal Prohibition agent.
I slurped down the first Vampire pretty quickly. It tasted like you’d expect: a pinch of cheap alcohol with some artificial fruit flavors. It was more about the ambience of the $1 drink than the actual taste, anyway. My unattainable expectations for my 21st were fulfilled in a new, maybe even better way.
I started to think about my original advice. Before an event, there is anticipation; afterward, a memory. Anticipation shapes experience, and experience constitutes memory. What will I remember in ten years, and just as importantly, how will I remember it? Do I want to remember the good and the bad, and how will I distinguish them? How can I make peace when things go wrong without missing out on the excitement and hope when things go well?
“Scott, what’re you thinking about?” my friend Sarah asked, noticing my blank face and crooked stare.
“Nothing important,” I said, smiling. At that moment, the waitress came back and asked if we needed anything.
“I’ll have another Vampire, please,” I said. I put the fangs in and handed her my cup.

I was scrambling to complete homework when my phone began to buzz, facedown on the desk.
The night before, I’d stayed up late reporting a story and scrambling to finish my application for an editor position at The Crimson. I answered the phone with a curt hello, planning to ask if my mother could talk later — I was busy.
But the call didn’t go as expected. I am struggling to find the words to describe such an intimate moment. My family is intensely private: There’s a running joke that we won’t even tell our doctors the full truth. Describing how she sounded when she told me her father was passing away — that’s a line I won’t cross.
He was still alive. He would not be soon. There was not enough time. I would not be there.
I still tried. I started running, running so fast that I almost tripped down the street. I didn’t know where to go. I didn’t know how to react, my body betraying me as it was overwhelmed with fear and loss. Which way was the airport? Where do I go for this?
My feet landed me firmly in front of my dorm. I only registered snippets of what my mother had said, her voice thick with tears. There was a fall. No time to fly back, to fly home. Had to go to talk to the doctors. Did I have someone there to talk to? The line went dead shortly after that.
I texted my friends, but how do you convey something like this in a text? Something along the lines of: “Hey everyone — my grandpa is dying in a hospital room right now. I can’t be alone.”
Seconds or maybe minutes later, a friend showed up as I stood in the courtyard of my dorm, where I realized I had been pacing. I ran into him like a wall and finally broke down as he guided me up the steps and to my common room couch.
Slowly, my friends begin to trickle in. If you know anything about me, you know I don’t like silences. I began to talk quickly, filling the air with stories and recollections and sobs that tumbled out of my mouth.
My grandfather spoiled me. He let me lay on his fancy living room couches. I could spend hours watching TV in his room. After school, he and I would often go to McDonald’s. He ordered the same thing every time — McChicken and fries. It’s still my favorite order.
For the first half of my life, he was one of the few people who I would spend an inordinate amount of time with, even more so than my mom. He would faithfully pick me up almost every single day from school, drive me to his house, and keep a watchful eye over me as I did my homework or read. His watchfulness was one of his best qualities. He would sit quietly and make sure everyone was well-fed and rested. When I was sick, he wouldn’t leave my side until he was convinced I was okay. He would wait for me outside of summer tennis classes to ensure I was safe and felt comfortable. He was vigilant, with a huge heart.
My grandfather was also a man of extreme habit. His favorite drink, always, was Crown Royal and coke. Whenever my grandma took him to the grocery store, it was his job, always, to pick out the fruit. (This would take over 15 minutes because he would meticulously look at every peach or banana until he collected the best ones.) He liked doing things with his gnarled hands — a vestige from his years doing manual labor — and would always mow his yard and my mom’s. He made busyness a habit. My grandfather was a provider, a hard worker, and a care-giver. But he was also so, so full of life. His skin glowed in the sun, his eyes would twinkle like we shared an inside joke. His laugh wasn’t frequent, but when it did sneak out, it was clear and genuine. 
He was gone now. And I didn’t get to say goodbye. (I couldn’t say this part. Another line I wouldn’t cross.)
***
In my family, grief is communal. Our funerals are packed to the brim with relatives, friends, friends of friends, neighbors from my family’s small town in Mexico, the mailman who gets a Christmas card every year. Funeral processions line more than five blocks. Mournful crowds recite prayers.
It was strange to experience this grief thousands of miles away from my mother or my uncles or my grandmother. There were no cousins to hug, no uncles who stood outside my door to guard me, no mothers to wipe my tears, no aunts to crack a joke to cheer me up.
Truthfully, I didn’t really process much of that day. That’s another part of grief. Still, when I look back, I remember one thing clearly — my mother’s question to me before she hung up the phone. Did I have someone here? 
Prior to that day, I probably would have said no. I had always believed we each existed in our own worlds at Harvard. Of course we did things together: we went to parties, shared meals in the dining hall, and talked for hours in courtyards and on dorm room couches. But rejection, heartbreak, loneliness — these were things we dealt with alone. There were certain lines we, too, did not cross. I had friends — wonderful, brilliant, hilarious, sweet friends who I loved — but I never really considered them being “there,” a replacement for that uncle or aunt or cousin. I never needed to, until now. It was their arms I fell into that day.
These friends who became my family with one phone call were the ones who ensured I made it on a plane that week. They brought me my favorite snacks (Kraft Mac & Cheese, Cheetos, and Kit Kats — a disgusting paradise) and even assigned shifts to make sure I was never alone for those first 24 hours. They hugged me even if they hated hugging (a constant battle between us). They cared, deeply and unconditionally, and I took that love with me back home, ready to say goodbye.
***
Three days after my grandfather passed, I touched down in Chicago.
My grandfather’s funeral was the most painful experience of my life, topping all surgeries, bee stings, stubbed toes, and broken bones. It still hurts to think about it a year later, but I imagine one day, I will remember the abundance of flowers and the musical prayers. I’ll hear the singing and the beautiful speeches that brought us to tears. I’ll be able to feel the pain after it lessens, ever so slightly.
Before I flew back to school, I went into my grandfather’s closet. This is the one line I will cross with you. I still see his ties, so neatly pressed, and his shoes, so evenly stacked. I smile at my memory of his hats, his favorite beanie laying on the very top of the pile. I can smell his aftershave, its clean scent coating his clothes. I kept grabbing his ties, trying to grasp a few more moments with him. I haven’t been back to that room since.
I traveled back to Massachusetts the next day, still smelling his aftershave on the plane.
***
When I got back to Cambridge, I needed something very out of the ordinary for me — some peace and quiet. I just wanted to be alone, to catch my breath.
I walked to the empty Harvard Crimson building. Ordinarily, I spent every day in that windowless building writing and editing, but since my grandfather passed, I hadn’t stepped inside once. It buzzes with activity at night, filled with the people doing the things that make a paper come together: reporters conducting interviews, editors proofing stories, everyone snacking on whatever greasy food we pick to fuel us that night.
I caught it during the midday silence that typically envelops the newsroom while people attend their classes. As I sat on the leather couch in the news conference room, I remembered my first meeting in this room my freshman year. I hesitate here and decide against name-dropping a few of the editors’ names because to me, they are still pseudo-celebrities. I worked hard to gain their approval and the approval of the people who came after them. I gained my confidence in that room and found a place in those meetings, and finally, when I became an editor, I became well acquainted with misery (and passion and fulfillment and a lot of coffee) there too.
Alone, listening to the slight hum of the empty building, I found that bit of solace I needed, a wave of gratitude washing over me.
When my mother asked me “Did I have someone there?", it was in large part thanks to this building that I could eventually say yes. These people — frustrating, talented, and warm-hearted — wrapped me with the same love that I felt at home. In moments where it was so very painful to be away from my family, my friends reminded me that I had a family here, too. It looked different — forged through long nights, stake-outs, trips to Boston, deliveries from McDonald’s, cups of hard apple cider — but it was family, nonetheless.
Did I have someone here? Yeah, mom, I think I do.

A few weeks ago, as we scavenged through the fridge for a semblance of a meal, my roommate asked about my trip to Whole Foods. I paused, arm half-submerged in the cheese drawer. My first instinct was to tell her that I hadn’t been to Whole Foods in months, that I didn’t know what she was talking about, that I didn’t even know where the closest Whole Foods was. But just below the surface, I knew she was right.
“When did I go?”
“Right after you went to Spirit Halloween,” she said. I retraced my steps and followed the trail, snaking my way along my walk toward Fresh Pond, into Spirit Halloween, and stumbled eventually on the memory of entering Whole Foods.
That wasn’t the first time I’d been unable to recall a simple memory without external reminders. It started in fourth grade, and for a long time, I thought that foggy memories and gaps in time were normal for everyone.
In high school, I had a close friend who would come to my house nearly every day and stay for hours. I have no idea what we did with all that time — we probably tucked ourselves under blankets and watched shows, maybe tried to study. Sometimes, I’d start telling her a story and she’d cut me off and say “I know, I was there,” or “You already told me this.” The scariest moments were when she would reminisce about times we had spent together. When I told her I couldn’t remember, she’d open her Snapchat memories and pull up the event in question. I’d look at the glowing image of myself, terrified of the collection of pixels on the screen: a me who I couldn’t remember.
During AP Psychology, I finally learned words to describe what I was struggling with — repression and dissociation. Repression, the act of forcing memories from your conscious into your subconscious; dissociation, feeling disconnected from your thoughts, experiences, and actions. Sometimes when I’m in a dissociated state I feel like I’m floating; sometimes I feel like I’m controlling a video game character. Other times my arms get tingly, like they’re falling asleep, my eyes unfocus, and my brain feels like it’s wading through thick jelly. Most of the time it feels like I’m asleep, like each object around me is a simulation from my mind.
Repression doesn’t take away just the bad memories — it snatches the good from my grasp, too. I don’t remember first meeting my friends; I don’t remember how we got so close. I don’t even remember most of the time we have spent together. I’m left insecure and uncertain about the connections I have with people, or the lack thereof. Friends fade quickly from my list of priorities, simply because my own subconscious snubs my emotional connection to them.
I’ve begun to adjust my approach. I compensate for the absence of a memory with analysis, categorization, and interpretation. I can memorize a fact more easily than I can store a memory, so I’ve started identifying people by qualities rather than memories. Upon discovering each new mode of classification — the MBTI personality types, the enneagram, the Hogwarts Houses — I hound my friends and family for their results so I can understand them on a deeper level than I would otherwise.
My most recent discovery is the five love languages. With it at my disposal, I’ve taken my approach a step further, drawing on each individual’s love language to provide our relationship substance.
My mother’s love language is acts of service, which manifests most clearly in the food she cooks. She cuts fruit for us and arranges it on fancy little plates. She cooks dinner almost every night, with enough leftovers for lunch the next day. If you ask her to make you breakfast, or a snack, she will always say yes. For her, I learned to cook, gathering recipes from TikTok, Instagram, and Google. From YouTube, I learned how to make ramen and dumplings from scratch. I also had her teach me recipes she learned from her mother — Cuban pulled pork, arroz con pollo, black beans. I’ve carried them with me and made them for my friends.
My roommate’s love language is quality time. We have picnics next to the Charles, feasting on hauls of brie and bread from Trader Joe’s, strawberries, and macaroons. We wander our way up to Porter Square and stop in the record store to escape the weather. At night we sit side by side on the couch, scraping our bowls of ice cream clean. For her, I’ve learned how significant the simple act of going on a walk can be. And I’ve learned that silence is okay, that the nearness of someone you love can be enough.
My father’s love language is gift giving, but not in the typical store-bought manner. It usually manifests as a gift of experience — concerts, plays, family vacations. During winter break we go to a mountainous state in the west with snow and dry air and hot chocolate. At nighttime we scramble along the icy deck and dunk ourselves into the hot tub, and after a shower we rendezvous in the living room to play card games in our pajamas and make smores in the fireplace. We go to Michigan during the summer, and spend time among grass that is thin, long, and soft, rather than thick, stumpy, and coarse like in Florida. I’ve started writing him stories, pieces of my imagination he can keep with him. I wrap them up on special occasions, tucked into the gauze of an old shoe box.
My own love language must be words of affirmation, a reminder, when memories fail me, that someone cares. When I was little and sick, my feeble body heaving into a grocery bag, inhaling the plastic in deep lungfuls, my parents would hold a bucket to my lips and offer relief in the way of soothing words. After the times they’ve cut open my ears, or carved out my tonsils, or patched up my mouth, I would awake in a bleached room and my parents would whisper that they wished it was them instead, that they would take the burden from me if they could.
I’m obsessed with letters, beginning with birthday letters. I didn’t like most parts of birthday parties. After the main party events — the pool, swimsuits dripping onto cream tile, fingers worming through knobbly roots for discarded piñata candy — came the dreaded task of opening presents. I didn’t know how to act, unwrapping each gift in front of all those eyes. I delicately peeled the tape aside, to keep the paper intact, and forced out a smile and a laugh.
The letters made the awkwardness of it all worth it. After the party, I could never bring myself to throw them away, even the simplest store-bought cards. I would bring them in a stack to my room and reread them, sitting on my carpet. When I was finished, I would slip them into a ziplock bag and tuck them into my bookcase. Some of them I would tape up, onto my wall, and when I was feeling lonely or sad I would read them again.
***
When I was in middle school, we went to the United Kingdom. I can’t remember most of the trip, not enough to write a whole story about it, anyway. I can only remember fragments, which, when combined, make the trip look something like this:
We go for a walk on our first day in London when we’re fresh off the plane, jet lagged and unshowered. We drink tea in Wales on a cold, overcast day. I’m almost run over by a double decker bus in Edinburgh. My brother buys shortbread in a tourist shop. We hike a desolate hill in the Lake District, with cold cuts and crackers in our backpacks. When we reach the top, I try to wake up, to force myself to memorize the way the lake looks, sparkling far below us, with sailboats dotting the distant dock and a scattering of tiny islands in the center.
But I couldn’t snap out of the trance, not even for a place that vibrated in my head with its newness. I hope that one day I’ll wake up, that I’ll be able to relive the past like it’s a slide, continuous, slick, rather than a puzzle missing half its pieces. And maybe when I do, I’ll break my habit of substituting memories with words.

When my father and I drive across the South Carolina border, I nearly cry because the world is so green. I had almost forgotten how I love that color, the way it shimmers in the pollen-veiled air and in the kudzu-choked pine trees on either side of I-26.
Last March, when Harvard sent an email announcing that students would not return to campus after spring break, my father drove from Charleston to Cambridge to bring me home: a 30-hour round trip. On the drive back we saw many things: New York City in the night, impossibly small; the Washington monument like a needle piercing the sky; billboards advertising local injury lawyers, wholesale furniture stores, and good old Christian salvation.
But everything that came before paled in comparison to that shock of green, which stretched all the way from the upstate to the lowcountry. Living, once again, in my childhood home, I watched the color deepen with each passing month. In South Carolina, every summer day brings a thunderstorm. Some mornings I’d wake up just after the rain stopped, and the grass would be the color of emeralds, each leaf on the live oaks saturated, the marsh aglow.
A friend once told me green is God’s color. It was something her grandmother often said in a Southern accent roughened by years of dispensing wisdom. When I write about the South, I write in shades of green. I call the trees by name: magnolia, dogwood, crabapple. I write about it with reverence. Home is a holy thing.
Last spring, I took a poetry workshop at Harvard. On the first day, we went around the room introducing ourselves. When I said I was from South Carolina, my teacher asked where.
“Charleston,” I said.
“That’s a good place to be from if you’re going to be from South Carolina.”
I laughed. “It’s the only place to be from.”
His comment didn’t really bother me. There was truth in it. Much of my home state is rural, ultra-conservative, and poorly educated. What troubled me more was my response. I thought of my grandmother. She lives near the mountains, in a tiny milltown where Baptist churches outnumber grocery stores. It’s the only home she has ever known. I was ashamed to have spoken so callously of it, and of places like it.
In that workshop, and in other classes since, my professors and peers have often noted that my writing is very Southern. They’re right — the setting I reach for most is the landscape of my childhood, the one I know best. But this comment always makes me laugh a little. I went to an arts high school, where I took creative writing classes each year. There, the Southerness of my writing was rarely discussed.
My classmates recognized the world within my writing as their own. There wasn’t the same element of otherness that Harvard students perceive. But I also wonder if, since I moved away from the South, it has crept into my work more than before. To some extent, I take advantage of its quirks and its natural beauty now in order to create a fairy-tale version of the South for readers who don’t know it firsthand.
However, I rarely use my writing to discuss the social realities of this world. At Harvard, these realities are often the subjects of jokes and critiques; the South, they say, is full of bible-beating racists. I struggle to challenge these reductive comments while also acknowledging the ways in which they are true. I’m constantly aware that the South I see is filtered through eyes that are inherently privileged. I am white, middle class, and straight. As my poetry teacher pointed out, I am from a larger city. Schools there are better funded, and there are more opportunities for cultural enrichment.
It is a privilege to write about the South the way I do, as a mythical world of wise old ladies and muddy creeks and velvet-antlered deer. Yet I try to complicate this world: I write about struggling with spirituality amid devout Christians and growing up with three sisters in a society permeated by patriarchy. Still, there are topics I’m afraid to touch. I don’t feel I have the right to dissect race or class, or fear I will do so incorrectly. But these are social structures which define the South and in which I play a role, whether I want to or not. Without acknowledging them, the picture I paint of my home is incomplete.
Yet the same is true for the way many of my peers at Harvard see the South. It frustrates me when people speak about it as if it’s a backwards land that is somehow beyond help. It’s an erasure of the millions of people working within it to create change — an erasure of the millions of people who are moral and good and have worthy contributions to make to the world. It’s too easy to assume that the only narrative the South has to offer is one of shame.
I think of my grandmother in her tiny town. From the outside, her world seems impossibly small. But I have seen it from within, and you would not believe how much one place, one person, can contain.
My grandmother keeps a garden that often appears in my poems and essays. She adorns it with stepping stones and butterfly bushes and hummingbird feeders. She defends it from snakes with a hoe, and often she uses it to chop their heads clean off. It’s a gruesome but necessary task, and she faces it without fear. In that garden, she has shown me that beauty and ugliness walk hand in hand. You can’t turn a blind eye to one or the other. You have to learn to see both.

The drive to my grandmother’s house goes like this.
Touch down in Tel Aviv each December and feel the breezes like sighs. Pick up the luggage, hope there aren’t too many Birthright trips clogging the line. Argue with the rental car guy.
We want a Mazda 3, we say. So does everyone, he says. We know there are some left, we can see them in the parking lot, we say. He relents. We cheer.
Mazda 3 secured, tune the radio to Galgalatz. If it’s playing b.s. music, try a bunch of different stations until the sound of Arik Einstein or Naomi Shemer pipes in. Then watch the wheels of the car kick up the red soil, smell the lantanas by the side of the road (and when you get close, the acid smell of chicken shit). Finally, finally breathe.
I’ve made the trip from Ben Gurion Airport to my savta Avia’s house more times than I can reasonably count. We went twice a year beginning three weeks after I was born, plus bonus trips for weddings and the occasional holiday. But time didn’t erode the feeling of crossing into another dimension when I passed Sa’ad Junction; if anything, it only increased.
Besides the great weather, what I loved most about going home was that my grandma never grasped what my life in the U.S. was like. She didn’t care what classes I was taking; she had no context for the anxieties of applying to college or, for that matter, climbing the ranks of The Crimson.
Instead, she touched the parts of me that are entirely divorced from my ambition: my passionate shopping habits, my laziness, my somewhat insincere professions of love for the gloopy seeded cookies she made each Wednesday. For a long time she didn’t know I wanted to go to Harvard. She had a different kind of knowledge — the certainty that the first afternoon I spent at her house I’d lug out the hammock chair and swing around for hours on the porch.
I saw her last in January 2019, at my aunt’s. We hugged our goodbyes and promised to meet again in March, when I planned to return for spring break. That evening, we drove past Sa’ad, past the lantanas, past the red soil. We returned the rental car and shuffled onto the plane. We silently laughed at the Birthright girls talking about how they’d found love with whatever hot Israeli drifter accompanied their trip, their voices like squeaky toys.
Then a month later, my mom called me. Savta had died overnight — a freak medical accident during a routine surgery, the oxygen leaving her brain in the hallway of the ICU.
I remember standing on the corner of DeWolfe Street, dumbfounded. I didn’t know what to do with all my love for her, my expectations of the years we would have together, my hope for another drive back home. They held her funeral that week, the parts of my life she had never known keeping me from it.
Our trips to Israel since she died have been just fine. I still love the weather when it gets so hot your iPhone stops working if you leave it in the car. I love the lantanas, the bougainvillea, and the citrus trees, too. But I miss shedding my empty worries and becoming the version of myself she knew. I’ve now had to do the worst kind of math: subtract one person I love from the earth, subtract one person who loves me.
After she died I made a promise to myself to be better — to stir my awkwardness until it dissolves, to pour my feelings for her into my parents, my brother, my acquaintances.
When I’m in the car with my mom, I play her favorite songs — the ones about little houses with red roofs, the ones about lilacs in the spring, the ones with no words, just melodies. We sing along as we watch the Massachusetts coast speed by, imagining it’s the Mediterranean.
Sometimes, when I roll down the window to smell the ocean, I dream I’m on a different road, headed to see her again. I pretend she’s still alive.
And one day, I hope, someone will feel the way I felt as they’ll be driving home to me.

Rebecca “Becky” A. Cooper ’10 actually remembers her freshman convocation speaker. Her voice deepens and her vowels lengthen as she mimics the “very illustrious Harvard accent” of Jeremy R. Knowles, a former dean.
“Your job for the next four years is to learn how to sort out the rot,” she remembers Knowles telling her freshman class.
“Going through Harvard to be able to sort out the bullshit,” Cooper paraphrases, “not to just be charmed by everything, but instead to sort it all out — I couldn’t imagine a better guiding principle to what a Harvard education should be.”
Though she graduated 10 years ago, Cooper has spent the last three years on Harvard’s campus living as an Adams “House Elf” (a title that allowed her to bake cookies and interact with undergraduates in exchange for room and board). She wasn’t just baking cookies, though. She was also writing her new non-fiction book, “We Keep the Dead Close: A Murder at Harvard and Half a Century of Silence,” published on Nov. 10.
The book dives into a story Cooper stumbled upon as an undergrad, which started out as little more than a rumor. The whispers told of a young Anthropology graduate student named Jane Britton. According to Anthropology department lore, a professor with whom Jane was having an affair murdered her and left her body in the Harvard Peabody Museum, dusted with red ochre powder, and Harvard covered the whole thing up.
Since first hearing the tale offhandedly more than 10 years ago, Cooper has dug into what truth lies behind the story — attempting to trace rumors, uncover secrets, and hold institutions accountable. In essence, trying to “sort out the rot.”
As a Literature concentrator, Cooper read a lot of stories at college, but she didn’t come across the tale of Jane’s murder in a book — she first heard it at a picnic in JFK park.
It was the spring of 2009, and Cooper was excited to have lunch with a friend she hadn’t seen one-on-one in months because the friend was “in the frenzied stage of dating.” About 15 minutes into lunch, her friend’s boyfriend arrived unexpectedly. Irked, Cooper decided to at least get a good story out of him. “So I bait him with this kind of half-remembered ghost story about this fire truck in Harvard Yard,” she recalls. “And he says, ‘Well, if you want to hear a really crazy Harvard story…’” He began to narrate the Havard murder that would stick with her for the next 10 years.
For more than a year, Cooper didn’t pass the story on to anyone. She remembers, “I just kind of carr[ied] it inside me.” That is, until the summer of 2010, when she was invited to a meeting by her advisor, who was an archeologist. “They were talking about spies, and double identities, and archaeology,” Cooper recalls. So she piped up: “‘Well, you want to hear a really crazy Harvard story?’”
When she finished the story, her listeners said nothing, just stared. Eventually, her advisor responded, “You know, it wasn’t in the Peabody Museum like you said. It was in her apartment.” And another person in the meeting said, “and that Professor that you’re talking about, he’s still on faculty.”
That’s when things changed for Cooper. “The story switched from seeming like this ghost story, fable, into something that seemed like it needed sincere attention.” She spent hours researching the murder on Google that night, looking for “every newspaper article that exists.”
After Cooper graduated (off-cycle) in the winter of 2010, she embarked on a few jobs before digging further into Jane’s murder. She worked as a research assistant, got hired by a sock company to make a “sockumentary” about giving socks to youth experiencing homelessness, travelled to France to work as a paralegal, and published her first book, “Mapping Manhattan.”
“I had promised myself that after I got that first book of maps out in the world, that if Jane’s story was still something that felt essential to me, then I could really pursue it,” Cooper recalls. And pursue it she did. When she got back from France in 2012, she returned to Harvard to audit the class of Karl Lamberg-Karlovsky — the man who was rumored to have killed Jane Britton.
From there, Cooper carefully “tiptoed” into the mystery. At a virtual Harvard Bookstore talk she says, “I was very scared. I felt like I was living inside a giant spider web, and if I just tugged the wrong string too soon, I would warn the exact people that I didn’t yet want to know I was working on this story. It just felt very claustrophobic.”
After auditing Lamberg-Karlovsky’s class, Cooper did some heavy research into the primary clue that pinned him as the murderer — the red ochre sprinkled over Jane’s dead body. “Red ochre is associated with some of the oldest burials in human history,” Cooper explains. “It seems like knowledge that only an anthropologist, or specifically archaeologists, would have.” Although old newspaper articles about the murder claimed that red ochre was the “perfect Near Eastern burial ritual,” Cooper did not find it used in Iran — where Jane and Lamberg-Karlovsky had conducted an archeological dig the summer before her murder.
She says, “If that [red ochre] didn’t seem as obvious a link as it had been in the original rumor, then the next obvious place for the investigation to go was with Jane herself.”
Cooper plunged into a rabbit hole of friends, relatives, and public records. She found Jane’s best friend in an old Radcliffe yearbook, who introduced her to Jane’s brother. She recounts, “that kind of opened up this whole world for me.” Eventually, Cooper realized just how shrouded the story was, that it “requires a kind of investigative journalist.” So when she was offered an opportunity to work for the New Yorker in 2014, she took it. “I wasn’t sure if it was a cowardly move,” she says, “or whether it was the most productive form of procrastination.” While at the New Yorker, she researched the murder on mornings and weekends and observed other journalists to learn how they access public records.
In the spring of 2017, Cooper finally decided she’d done all she could during morning and weekend hours. She left the New Yorker and flew out to meet Jane’s closest friends and family on the West Coast. They helped her obtain documents and walked her through their memories of Jane’s apartment.
Cooper then continued digging — literally. She travelled to Bulgaria, embarking on a two-week archeological dig to experience more of Jane’s world for herself.
That fall, she began to put the book together. Cooper took up residence on Harvard’s campus, baking cookies for undergrads and writing her book. She was just finishing up her proposal a year later when she learned that Jane’s case had at last been solved. Though Cooper had been researching the murder for many years, it was only in 2018 that she found out for certain who killed Jane.
“I’m writing the story at the same time as the ending is shifting from under my feet,” she says. “And this is all happening at Harvard. And I’m not telling anyone. Only the Palfreys” — the Adams House faculty deans — “really know what I’m working on.”
Having the opportunity to write the book at Harvard turned out to be more valuable than Cooper expected. “To be able to physically slide within myself the Harvard Square from 2018, to the Harvard that I knew from 2010, to the Harvard that Jane was walking around in the ’60s — it was incredible to feel that kind of dislocation in time.”
The fact that the physical place where Cooper was writing her book had remained largely unchanged between those three periods of times — the student body filters in and out every four years, but the old brick buildings and long standing traditions do not — allowed Cooper to think critically about her own time at Harvard in the context of Jane’s murder.
“It became, for me, a kind of exploration of gender dynamics in academia, and I think so much of it I was blind to when I was there as an undergraduate. Partially because I was nurtured by the literature department, and partially just because Harvard’s a seductive place,” she says. “The chance to come back and re-see the structure of academia and really kind of look at it from more of a systems level was just extraordinary.”
Cooper’s ultimate wish for her book is that it will spur people to take a closer look at stories like Jane’s in order to think less about the individuals at fault, and more about the power structures – like Harvard — behind them.
“I’m really hoping that it’ll strike up a conversation about the need to not think about it just as a couple of bad professors, or a couple of problematic departments,” she says. “We really need to see this as a larger call to action for thinking of this as a systemic issue.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Newly elected members of the 117th Congress convened virtually earlier this month for a bipartisan orientation hosted by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics.
Held online for the first time in its 48 year history, the orientation, which took place this year from Dec. 7 to Dec. 15, strives to acquaint representatives-elect with their colleagues, spark discussions on various policy issues, and bridge the gap between politics and academics by introducing the perspectives of Harvard faculty.
Over the course of the program, Harvard affiliates — including Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf, Professor of the Practice of Public Leadership Wendy R. Sherman, and School of Public Health adjunct professor Ashish K. Jha — led a series of talks ranging from the United States’ role in the world to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and ensuing recession on vulnerable Americans.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow hosted a closing conversation. Other panelists included incoming White House Chief of Staff Ronald A. Klain and four current members of Congress: Daniel R. Crenshaw (R-Texas), Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.), Ayanna S. Pressley (D-Mass.), and Elise M. Stefanik ’06.
IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78 wrote in an emailed statement he was grateful the orientation was able to take place during the health crisis.
“Technology allowed members to join us virtually — from Hawaii to Utah to New Mexico to New York — and to continue the longstanding tradition of newly elected members building connections before they begin their service in Washington,” Gearan wrote. “Based on the individual sessions and feedback we have received, we were pleased that the program was able to meet the goals we set out for this convening.”
Gearan wrote that attendance over Zoom was comparable to in-person orientations in previous years, adding that equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans participated.
Kennedy School Professor of the Practice of Public Leadership Arthur C. Brooks said in an interview that he spoke to the new members about how to reduce polarization in American politics.
“The loudest, most hateful voices are the ones that are getting most of the attention,” Brooks said. “I don’t think that’s what Americans want. I think it’s bad for the country.”
Brooks said the newly elected representatives seemed receptive to his message.
“A lot of them were saying, ‘Yes, this is really why I got into Congress — I love my constituents, and I love my country, and I love even the people who disagree with me, and I want to show that,’ so I was really encouraged,” he said.
Among the invitees who did not attend the IOP’s program was Marjorie Taylor Greene, the incoming representative for Georgia’s 14th Congressional District and noted supporter of the conspiracy theory group QAnon, according to a spokesperson who declined to comment on why Greene declined her invitation.
High-profile incoming members of Congress have taken issue with aspects of the program in previous years.
In 2018, then-freshman Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) took to Twitter to criticize the orientation for featuring speeches by powerful corporate leaders while not giving a platform to labor activists.
Brooks said typical in-person engagement was difficult to replicate over Zoom. Still, he said he was happy the event proceeded and that he was able to participate in it.
“It was less interactive than it would be ordinarily because you just get more high quality human interaction where people are hanging out between the meetings,” Brooks said. “You prefer to be able to do it in person, but it’s worth doing even if you can’t.”
Gearan wrote that future members of Congress will benefit from a return to in-person orientations.
“Like students anxious to return to campus for in-person instruction, I suspect new members of the 118th Congress will look forward to coming to Cambridge in 2022,” he wrote.
The 117th Congress will convene in January 2021.
