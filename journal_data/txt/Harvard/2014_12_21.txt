After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The sheer passion in the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s red-hot production of “Seneca’s Medea,” translated by the Harvard Classics Club, could have set ablaze the ghostly waters of the Adams Pool Theater. Running from Nov. 20 to Nov. 23, perhaps the show’s only foible was that it did not provide ice-cold lemonade (or should I say ambrosia) along with the cast’s coruscating performance. The actors’ ability to convey the nuances of their characters’ emotions through their mastery of tone and gesture as well as and the production’s remarkable use of the theater’s vestigial pool features made for a dramatic spectacle.
The production, directed by Veronica S. Wickline ’16, is based on a play written by Roman dramatist Seneca and set ten years after Medea, a barbarian sorceress, helped Jason conquer the various adversaries that separated him from the coveted golden fleece. Despite their happy marriage and two sons, Jason’s need for political protection from Creon, the king of Corinth, pushes him to marry Creon’s daughter, Creusa. The play begins in medias res with Medea plotting her revenge: the murder of the bride and of the sons she had with Jason.
The show’s greatest treasure was Juliette Cremel ’17, who plays Medea. Cremel’s meticulously expressive movement and nuanced communication of her anger enabled her to dive into Medea’s skin from the second she made her first appearance. This feat is especially laudable since her first lines are a lengthy monologue filled with complex invocations of several deities. Her initial movements already invoked the dark ambience of the production: her walk to the spotlight was slow, and the way she dragged her feet embodied the weight of the anguish Medea carried. Once in the spotlight, she emitted a low moan, sinking down to her knees. By the time she began her opening soliloquy, her mere presence on the stage had already communicated the pathos of the play. Cremel conveyed her despair in the moments between her lines. For instance, after her rapturous invocation, “ye goddesses who avenge crime…with your bloody hands, be present now,” she paused with a fierce gaze.  Often she yelled her lines, allowing her to express a hot fury, and in other moments she hissed with a chilling venom. Such nuance in Cremel’s performance infused the mythical Medea with a realism that transformed the performance into a universal portrayal of the human condition, one that was easily relatable in its timelessness and thereby all the more moving. Cremel’s emotional tour de force transformed Medea into the Greek chorus of her own tragedy, justifying Wickline’s decision to exclude the group of Corinthian women used to set the tone in Seneca’s original version.
Wickline’s decision to let Cremel’s native French origin shine in the performance further bolstered the successful development of Medea’s character . Medea’s rejection of her entire barbarian heritage to join Jason leaves her a foreigner to her own kingdom, an isolation that magnifies her despair as Jason prepares to marry Creusa. Cremel’s French lilt was a subtle reminder of Medea’s non-Greek heritage. In addition, Cremel used French in her murderous incantations and sang the popular lullaby “Doucement s’en va le jour” instead of the play’s original Latin odette as she gave her children a last goodbye. The substitution of French for Latin in Seneca’s Greek score combined with other modern elements of the production—such as the syncopated rock music played during the transitions and Medea’s cigarettes—to give the ancient tragedy an engaging 21st century flavor.
Julie Thimmig’s performance as Medea’s nurse was equally fierce. Thimmig complemented Cremel’s more violent outbursts with a steady but powerful voice that conveyed her character’s wisdom. Thimmig’s successful conveyance of the nurse’s stability in the face of Medea’s folly was best represented in her fearful monologue about Medea’s imminent poisoning of the bride. Medea’s silent stirring of the fateful concoction in the background was juxtaposed with Thimmig’s worry-ridden proclamation of her queen’s criminal plots. The soliloquy was expressed in a well-enunciated, clear tone that emphasized the nurse’s rational fear against Medea’s festering, suppressed vengefulness.
The production’s thoughtful and innovative use of the set accentuated the subtlety of the actors’ performances. Most notable was the use of the highly reflective windows at either side of the pool basin. Rather than always addressing the audience straight on, the characters sometimes turned to them as they spoke their lines, their faces visible to the audience in these mirrors. This indirect way of performing the lines to the audience was ideal for conveying the intensely personal nature of Medea’s internal dialogues: one could actually imagine that Cremel was addressing her own conscience as she exclaimed, “Soul! Why do you hesitate?”At the same time, the spectators were not excluded in this interchange as the actor’s reflection always made eye contact. Such effective use of the set  helped make Medea’s conflicted internal state all the more compelling.
The HRDC’s production was an admirable tribute to Seneca’s play as well as an innovative modern take on the myth of Medea. The impeccable performance of the actors communicated a firestorm of passion that was expertly complemented by whimsical anachronistic touches and clever use of the theater’s space.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the game tied at 65-apiece and 22 seconds left in regulation, Harvard women’s basketball coach Kathy Delaney-Smith called a timeout to set up the final possession against a tough Northeastern squad.
The play was designed to get the ball into senior forward Temi Fagbenle’s hands—Fagbenle had notched a double-double in the first half alone, and her stature and experience made it an easy go-to call for Delaney-Smith for the final possession.
But when senior guard Ali Curtis tossed the ball to Fagbenle, the 6’4” forward was immediately triple-teamed. Fagbenle dumped the ball off to junior forward AnnMarie Healy, who dribbled under the basket, turned around, and pulled up for the short jumper. One missed Northeastern (2-5) layup later, and the Crimson (5-4) survived a nail-biter, 67-65.
“The whole plan was for [Fagbenle] to take it and get it to the hoop, and they definitely put a lot of pressure on her…so she took a chance on me,” Healy said.
The Crimson employed a zone defense from the get-go, stifling the Huskies’ early on. Northeastern shot just 24.3 percent from the floor in the first half, and Harvard took advantage of the missed buckets to take a six-point lead into the break, with Fagbenle tallying 10 points and as many rebounds to lead the charge.
Then, the Huskies jumped into an offensive groove. After scoring just eight points in the first 13 minutes of the game, Northeastern capitalized on a slew of second-half Crimson turnovers and Harvard’s 1-for-10 shooting to open up the half to embark on a 12-2 run to open the half. With about nine minutes remaining, the visitors had not only wiped away the deficit but also had built a 10-point lead.
But the Huskies’ defensive aggressiveness—including a full-court press that caused a few of Harvard’s 11 second-half turnovers—also created foul trouble that put Northeastern in the penalty with eight minutes to go. The Crimson got to the free-throw line 21 times, making 16, compared to the Huskies’ 12, to slowly climb back into the game.
“We were able to get the points without the clock running, so especially when you’re down, that is a big deal, when you’re trying to get back from a pretty big deficit,” Healy said.
Both teams began the game uncharacteristically cold from downtown, shooting a combined 0-for-17 from three after shooting 33 percent all season. But after missing its first 16 treys, Harvard began hitting shots when it counted.
Junior guard Shilpa Tummala, who took second in a national three-point shooting contest in high school, knocked down a trey with 5:44 remaining to cut Northeastern’s lead to one. A few Crimson free throws later, and the home team regained the lead.
Then, captain Erin McDonnell—who had been 0-for-4 from beyond the arc—hit back-to-back treys, but Northeastern responded each time with threes of its own to keep the game tight down the stretch.
“Erin has spent her entire career getting punished if she doesn’t catch and shoot when she’s open,” Delaney-Smith said. “However, Erin was not hitting those threes, or any of her shots, but you don’t ever tell an unselfish shooter like Erin to stop shooting, because then when you need her she’s not going to be able to hit it, so...our philosophy here for a shooter like Erin is to just keep shooting.”
After a month of playing on the road, Harvard finally returned home to Lavietes Pavilion, and the hardwood wasn’t the only thing familiar on Saturday.
On top of playing during finals period—five Crimson players took exams Saturday morning—Harvard had the additional challenge of facing a Northeastern squad that was coached by Kelly Cole, who was on Harvard’s sidelines for the previous two years as an assistant coach.
“Even way before she came to Harvard, I thought she should have been head coach somewhere, so I loved that she was with us for two years,” Delaney-Smith said. “I knew that it would be a chess match. We both did game adjustments that we probably knew each other were doing, so it was great.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s been almost two weeks since the Harvard men’s basketball team (7-1) stepped onto the hardwood, its longest break of the season. Yet, although players have just concluded their exams, Harvard is still yet to take its toughest test: a matchup against the No. 5/6 University of Virginia Cavaliers in Charlottseville Sunday.
“It’s a big game,” NBCSports.com’s Rob Dauster told The Crimson in October. “When you look at the schedule you don’t see a lot of high name teams… if they can come out of there with a win, this a team that is going to be respected all year long.”
The matchup garnered significant hype early in the season, when Harvard held a top-25 ranking. However, the Crimson was upset early by Holy Cross (5-3) at TD Garden when senior Wesley Saunders missed a last second jumper that would have given the Crimson the win.
Harvard saw not only its top ranking, but also its regard as one the preeminent mid-major teams in the country slip away. Sunday’s contest is a chance to earn that all back. The Crimson carries a six-game win streak into the contest, with a chance to claim its largest scalp of the Tommy Amaker era. The Cavaliers are Harvard’s only scheduled ranked opponent this season and the highest ranked opponent that the team has faced since squaring off against No. 4/4 UConn exactly four years ago.
“I think it gives us a measuring stick and a target,” Amaker said.
Typically, upsets in college basketball are the product of stout defense and offensive outbursts. Harvard has the capability and pedigree—see its wins over New Mexico and Cincinnati—to produce both. The Crimson’s defense currently ranks 17th in the NCAA in scoring defense at 56.1 points per game and has held seven of its first eight opponents this season to 65 points or less and to 40.0 percent shooting or under.
Co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi and classmate Kenyatta Smith are two of the premier shot blockers in the country, both averaging 2.1 blocks per game. Add in Saunders’ 2.8 steals per game and Amaker has once again put out the most formidable defense in the Ancient Eight.
Offensively, Harvard boasts one the most feared backcourts in the nation. Saunders, the reigning Ivy League Player of the Year, is the only player in the nation currently averaging at least 20 points, seven rebounds, and four assists per game. ESPN college basketball columnist Eamonn Brennan predicted that it was Saunders’ performance that “we will be talking about Monday morning.”
“Replicating anything close to those numbers on the road against one of the nation's best defenses is a tremendous ask,” ESPN’s Eamonn Brennan wrote. “If Saunders can pull it off, he'll finally get some of the player-of-the-year love he probably already deserves.”
Starting alongside Saunders is junior captain and point guard Siyani Chambers. Chambers is a proven floor general who was named to the 2015 Bob Cousy Award Watch List, the third straight year that the he has been tabbed among the top point guards in the nation.
But none of that should faze Virginia. The Cavaliers defense ranks first in the NCAA in scoring defense at 47.9 a game, 20th in rebounds per game, and holds opponents to just 32.5 percent shooting from the floor. Offensively, Justin Anderson, a front-runner for the Wooden Award, leads Virginia at 15.8 points per game.
“They have been an outstanding defensive team. They don’t overextend themselves, they make you execute and be very efficient,” Amaker said Thursday. “Their personnel it outstanding and they play a style that they believe in.”
“I don’t think there’s a weakness [in the defense], to be honest with you,” he added.
Anderson has knocked down 22 of his 37 attempts thus far this year, the lone bright spot on a team without much shooting to space the floor. UVA players not named Anderson have made just 10 of their 58 attempts and if Amaker can lock down Anderson, a zone defense may be the formula for knocking off one of the nation’s top teams.
In fact, one need not look back far to find hints for how Amaker may hope to contain Anderson. Against fifth-seeded Cincinnati in the NCAA tournament last March, Amaker employed a plethora of different defensive schemes to shut down Bearcat star Sean Kilpatrick, perplexing Cincinnati’s offense in route to the win.
Virginia head coach Tony Bennett is not taking Harvard lightly, noting earlier this week that it was “another well coached team that has really established itself” before cracking a joke at the Crimson’s expense.
“Hopefully they had an 18-day break for their exams,” Bennett said, almost correctly guessing the Crimson’s 13-day break.
While Bennett was whimsical, Amaker was focused in the Thursday press conference. Waving off questions about the team’s national standing, the coach focused on his team’s ability to maintain efficiency on the offensive end.
“I don’t know that we are overrated or underrated,” Amaker said. “We are who we are. We think we are a solid basketball program and have had a solid start to our season. We are hopeful we have enough in the tank to go compete and be efficient [Sunday].”
