After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mistakes proved costly for the Harvard women's basketball team as it fell, 88-73, to Southern Methodist University on Sunday during the consolation round of the Surf 'N Slam Classic at San Diego State's Viejas Arena. The Crimson (7-5) gave up a combined 50 points off turnovers and free throws en route to a loss at the hands of the Mustangs (9-4).
In the first-ever meeting between the teams, it was SMU junior Keena Mays who ran the floor for the afternoon, putting up a game-high 25 points. Mays, who transferred from Kansas at the beginning of the year, was followed by fellow guard, senior Alisha Filmore, who notched 22 points. Junior forward Akil Simpson closed out the power trio of scoring with 15 points for the night. No player on either team recorded a double-double.
The Crimson shot at 49 percent from the field, led by senior guard Victoria Lippert and her team-high 20 points. The San Diego native drilled a perfect five-of-five from behind the arc, a new career high. Against No. 14/13 Oklahoma State on Friday night, Lippert was held to just one three the entire night out of her six attempts.
[Lippert] is the type of player that can give us a big spark offensively and she was able to do that,” co-captain Emma Golen said. “She had some big shots at very key times. [Lippert] can hit shots when you need her to hit shots and that's what she did tonight.... She created some energy for us that was lacking."
Three other Harvard players saw double digit scoring. Sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle put up 16 points and led the effort on against the glass, grabbing eight rebounds and four blocks, both game-highs. Guards Christine Clark and Ali Curtis scored 11 and 12 points, respectively. Clark led the Ivy League in scoring at the start of this weekend, with an average of 16.6 points per contest. Golen entered the game at the top of the nation in three-point percentage, hitting 66 percent behind the arc, but missed all four attempts during the match-up.
The game started well for the Crimson, who jumped to an early lead with a pair of jumpers from Clark and Fagbenle in the first minute of play. A trey from Lippert brought Harvard up on the Mustangs, 7-6, and a trio of layups by Fagbenle and Curtis led the Crimson to its final lead of the day, 13-10, five and a half minutes into the game. A Mays three tied the contest and from there, SMU would never trail Harvard.
After powerful shooting from Lippert tied the game again at 23-all, the Mustangs went on a 14-2 run over the next four minutes that allowed the team to head into the locker room with a 10 point advantage. In the second period, SMU eventually stretched their lead to as much as 20 points with just over five minutes remaining in the game.
“I think we hung with them in the first half and felt pretty confident going into the second half, but we kind of fell apart in the second half,” Golen said. “They were just hitting in transition. They hit some tough shots and they hit some pretty good shots. We couldn't hang on and get the defensive shots we needed.”
Errors were particularly fatal for the Crimson. 20 Harvard turnovers gave way to 30 points for the Mustangs, who shot at 76.9 percent from the charity stripe, netting 20 points.
“Turnovers are a thing we're always constantly focusing on and trying to reduce in each of our games,” Curtis said. “The other team was very in our face and very good at pressuring defensively so I think offensively we have to be ready to expect that and be on the attack instead of back on our heels.”
Turnovers were also a common theme in the heartbreaking overtime loss to Boston Universty in Dec. 10. 22 were committed as the Crimson fell to the Terriers, 68-61.
The loss is the third straight for Harvard. The Crimson squad has not held a three-game losing streak since the very beginning of last season.
“I thought overall, we learned a lot from playing such a good opponent,” Curtis said. “It really got us prepared for Ivy League [games] coming up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Perhaps overshadowed by the Harvard men’s basketball team’s collapse to St. Mary’s was the strong play of sophomore forward Jonah Travis.
Making his sixth career start, Travis scored a game-high 19 points—matching a career high—on just 10 shots.
“It was amazing,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said of the sophomore’s performance. “I thought he played his butt off.”
Travis scored nine points in the first 8:24 of play, helping the Crimson jump out to a 16-12 advantage over the heavily favored Gaels.
Before it was all said and done, Travis had added 10 more points and finished the game shooting 8 of 10 from the field.
Travis was quick to credit the play of sophomore Wesley Saunders and freshman Siyani Chambers—the Crimson’s first and second leading scorers this season, respectively—for his success.
“I can kind of hide in the shadows a little bit,” Travis said. “I’m not always the focal point of the scouting report, so when [Saunders and Chambers are] having success, usually that allows me to have some breakout games.”
But after picking up two fouls in the first half, Travis struggled with foul trouble in the second period. And after picking up his fourth foul with 3:36 to play, Travis was sent to the bench with 2:26 remaining and the Crimson clinging to a six-point lead.
Travis returned to the game with 2:08 to go after St. Mary’s pulled within four and eventually fouled out with 1.1 seconds remaining.
“We missed not having him in there with foul trouble and then we fouled out at the end,” Amaker said.
Travis finished with a total of 24 minutes on the court. Sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi replaced Travis and finished with eight points on three-of-seven shooting and four rebounds.
His eight points marked Moundou-Missi’s second highest offensive output of the season.
BIG D
In addition to his 14 points, Saunders also contributed on the defensive end.
For 40 minutes, the 6’5” wing covered Saint Mary’s top scorer, senior point guard Matthew Dellavedova. Dellavedova, who entered the contest averaging 18.5 points per game, was held to four points—a season low—on 1-of-13 shooting from the field.
After missing his first seven attempts, Dellavedova finally got on the board off a pair of free throws with 50 seconds remaining in the first period.
But Dellavedova wasn’t on the only Gael struggling offensively. In the opening frame, Saint Mary’s shot 7 of 31 from the field and one of nine from beyond the arc. The Gaels faired better in the second half, finishing the game with a 40 percent field goal percentage—still well below its mark of 51 percent entering the contest.
Mitchell Young and James Walker III paced the Gaels with 16 and 12 points, respectively.
CROWDSURFING
After watching their team struggle throughout the opening frame, the 2847 fans who packed into McKeon Pavilion on New Year’s Eve came alive in the second half.
“You could definitely see how much the players fed off the crowd especially in the closing couple minutes,” Travis said.
But in the opening frame, Amaker felt the Crimson managed to keep the crowd at bay.
“I thought we played well enough where we kept the crowd out of it for the majority of the game,” said Amaker, whose squad led by 14 points at the break.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the year and the NFL regular season coming to a close, The Back Page takes a look back at the ups and downs of Harvard alums in the big leagues. While some found success and others faltered, the Crimson made its mark on professional sports in 2012.
On the gridiron, Baltimore Ravens Center Matt Birk ‘98 is the only Harvard alum slated to make an appearance in the NFL postseason. After a 17-23 loss to the Bengals on Sunday, the Ravens will take on the Colts next Sunday in the AFC Wild Card Round. The Ravens finished atop the AFC North for the second straight year, ending the season with a 10-6 record despite losing four of their last five contests.
Birk made a splash off the field this season, coming out against gay marriage in an editorial in the Minnesota Star Tribune. While some may take issue with his politics, Birk’s anchoring presence in the Ravens’ defensive line this season has been undeniable. Before helping secure a playoff spot for his team, Birk was named a finalist for the 2013 Bart Starr Award, an honor bestowed by Athletes in Action to the NFL player who shows the strongest commitment to family and community as decided by a vote of NFL players.
In Buffalo, Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 was unable to guide his team to the playoffs, and he might not get another chance. After failing to make the postseason for the 13th season in a row—the longest streak in the NFL—the Buffalo Bills have begun to jettison their staff. Among those already fired is coach Chan Gailey, who put up a 16-32 record in three losing seasons with the Bills.
It remains to be seen whether Fitzpatrick will remain the Bills’ starting quarterback in 2013, as rumors have been circulating all season about finding a replacement. After inking a six-year, $62 million contract last year, Fitzpatrick has failed to develop into the offensive catalyst the Bills’ front office had hoped he would. This season he finished 17th in the league in passing.
In addition to Jeremy Lin ’10’s success in the NBA, it was an exciting year for 2011-2012 men’s basketball captains Keith Wright ’12 and Oliver McNally ‘12, who each inked contracts to play professionally abroad. In Canada, point guard McNally leads the NBL in assists and assists per game for the Moncton Miracles. The Miracles hold a 10-11 record, good for third place in the Atlantic Division.
Overseas, forward Wright—who signed with Swedish team Uppsala in October—ranks second on the team in points per game, with 14.82. Entering the new year, Uppsala  sits in second place in the league, having won four of its last five contests.
With the NHL lockout reaching day 108, the NHL and the NHLPA met in person today to resume negotiations after a three-week hiatus. Games have already been cancelled through mid-January—more than 50% of the season—and it remains to be seen whether the likes of Alex Killorn ’12 and Alex Biega ’10 will have a chance to play in the top league in 2013.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Well, we made it. The world didn’t end (even though Harvard men’s basketball fans might feel like it did), and the Crimson is back on the court and ice starting tomorrow, when the women’s basketball team hosts intrastate rival UMass to kick of a packed January schedule for Harvard sports. Now that we’re on the other side, let’s take a minute to reflect on the performances of 2012 and what teams should resolve to change going forward in 2013.
Men’s Basketball:
While Monday night’s last-second loss to Saint Mary’s was frustrating, the Crimson led its favored opponent the entire game, surprising almost everyone in the audience. After holding the Gaels to a 22.6 field goal percentage in the first half, Harvard could not contain a reinvigorated St. Mary’s offense that shot 65.3 percent from the field in the second. With a relatively shallow bench and a starting five that rack up huge minutes each time out, the Crimson has struggled to stay consistent—especially on defense—for the full 40 minutes. If you’re Crimson coach Tommy Amaker, you have to be thinking defense, defense, defense.
Resolution: Tighten up post defense to avoid letting leads slip away late in the game.
Women’s Basketball:
With sophomore star Temi Fagbenle—who sat out her freshman season due to NCAA regulations—stepping up on offense, the team has made putting points on the board look easy. Fagbenle has scored in the double digits in her last four starts, and the team has also been aided by a consistent sophomore Christine Clark and confident senior Victoria Lippert, who led the team with 20 points in its loss to SMU Sunday. But no amount of points will compensate for sloppy ball handling, and indeed the Crimson has been plagued by turnovers that have led to quick points in transition for its opponents. Despite outscoring the Mustangs 38 to 24 in the paint, Harvard lost in part due to 20 costly turnovers that led to 30 points for SMU.
Resolution: Slow down the passing game and avoid unnecessary points off turnovers.
Men’s Hockey:
Last season the team topped the nation in power play goals, converting an impressive 27.3 percent of its opportunities. This year, that number has dropped to 7.7 percent, up from 6.1 after the Crimson scored its only goal against Northeastern with the advantage in a 5-1 loss last weekend. With its touted penalty kill absent during the last two games—down to 50 percent against UMass and 25 percent against the Huskies—failing to convert power play opportunities is a recipe for disaster for the Crimson.
Resolution: Take advantage of power play opportunities to put easy points on the board.
Women’s Hockey:
With only one loss so far this season and a perfect conference record, the No. 4 women’s hockey team looks hard to beat. Returning to the ice on Jan. 4 for the first time since early December, it remains to be seen whether the Crimson—undefeated in its last seven games—can keep up its current hot streak. But, with Harvard’s deadly combination of senior Laura Bellamy and freshman Emerance Maschmeyer in the net—ranked first and third in goaltending nationally—combined with 16th leading scorer Jillian Dempsey, the second half of the season looks nothing but promising.
Resolution: With a marathon second half schedule—18 games in less than two months—stay healthy and injury free.
This New Years, The Harvard Crimson staff resolves to keep you updated on Harvard athletics throughout J-term as we count down to the spring semester. Follow The Back Page and @THCSports for the most up-to-date news and analysis. Happy New Year!
