After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Thursday, President Obama announced that he is scaling down plans to deploy a missile shield involving complex Eastern European bases on Polish and Czech ground. The expensive and technologically advanced long-range missile shield will be replaced by a more efficient and technologically feasible system of sensors and interceptors. We believe the decision was a sensible one, especially since the new plan relies on technology that has been tested and proven efficient, whereas the older plan relied on dubious, expensive technology that was still being developed.
Moreover, the proposed shield was impractical and overly ambitious. Recent intelligence reports have shown that Iran isn’t developing the long-range missiles that the Eastern European missile shield could have protected against. The new plan, on the other hand, addresses the imminent threat that a nuclear Iran poses, which come mainly from low- to medium-range missiles. Intelligence has reported that Iranians have developed missiles with empty spaces in them that can hold nuclear devices. This new system can protect Israel and Eastern Europe from such Iranian missiles in a cheaper and more efficient manner.
This move reaffirms the president’s goal of cutting Cold War-era defense programs and replacing them with modern projects that cater to the military needs of the 21st century. The current plan is less ambitious than the Star Wars system, imagined by President Reagan, but it does the job required far more efficiently. It takes into consideration the technology and threats present in today’s world.
Politically, President Bush’s ambitious plan of missile defense had long aggravated Russia, who thought the system was directed against it. Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, however, welcomed Obama’s plan, calling it “responsible.” On that note, we are pleased that the new plan will improve relations between Moscow and Washington, especially leading up to talks on nuclear-missile reductions scheduled to take place later this month. The White House, however, was quick to point out that the plan does not represent a concession to the Russians, but a reassessment of military needs in the region. We applaud this assessment of military needs and efficiency and hope it is carried out in future military plans.

While President Obama fights for the survival of his biggest campaign promise—health-care reform—he’s found it easier to make good on another: net neutrality. On Monday, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Julius Genachowski proposed new regulations that would prevent Internet service providers from discriminating against web traffic based on its content. We welcome this effort to preserve the open nature of the Internet, which has made the web such a boon to entrepreneurship and free speech.
Streaming video websites like YouTube would have been unthinkable in the days of dial-up Internet because the network couldn’t handle the data flow—or bandwidth—required to transfer clips. With the advent of broadband and subsequent improvements to network infrastructure, bandwidth-intensive websites like YouTube have boomed in popularity. The increased carrying capacity of the Internet has opened up a world of possibilities, from video chatting with your mom on Skype to Nigerian medical students observing surgeries in the U.S.
Increased bandwidth use is good for the public, but it’s a headache for Internet providers. Because most broadband services offer their customers unlimited bandwidth, there is no incentive for users to shy away from file-sharing, Skyping, and other bandwidth-hogging behavior. To continue offering unlimited access at the same speed, ISPs must find ways to either expand their capacity or discourage high bandwidth use. One of the solutions has been to decrease the download speeds of customers trying to use high-bandwith websites. Last year, the FCC chastised Comcast for deliberately slowing down BitTorrent, a file-sharing application, without telling its customers.
Allowing ISPs to choose which Internet activities get priority has several worrying implications. It could lead to anti-competitive behavior by ISPs, many of which also provide services that compete with new Internet tools. For example, Comcast has been widely accused of slowing the traffic of Vonage, an Internet phone service that competes with Comcast’s own similar service. (The two companies have since agreed to cooperate.) If ISPs are allowed to discriminate against content providers, they will do so in their own interests—if Comcast ever wanted to launch its own video streaming site, it could slow down YouTube to cripple the competition.
Others fear that ISPs could start charging high-bandwidth websites for access to the “fast lane,” slowing down smaller websites that can’t afford to pay. This would be a blow to the level playing field that has allowed entrepreneurs to create online empires from humble beginnings in a garage or basement, perhaps explaining why Internet giants like Google and Amazon are among net neutrality’s strongest proponents. What would your life today be like if someone told Mark Zuckerberg that his new “Facebook” site was using too much bandwidth?
We recognize that ISPs must find ways to ration their limited bandwidth effectively; however, this is still possible without picking the Internet’s winners and losers. Cell-phone providers charge talkative people more money, but they don’t charge based on who they’re talking to. Similarly, ISPs could charge users for the amount of bandwidth they consume, as long as they treat all Internet use equally. When ISPs start deciding which sites reach the masses and which don’t—no matter the criteria—they distort the marketplace of ideas and stifle the spirit of equality that has helped the Internet shape our world.

Over the past 20 minutes, you’ve felt a slow increase of anxiety. The sinking feeling of being completely overwhelmed is imminent. You feel uncomfortable, bordering on frantic, and try to calm yourself down to no avail. Finally, you begin to get the feeling that everyone is ahead of you, and panic sets in. No, this is not your organic chemistry section—it’s your daily cardio workout at the MAC. 
It’s no surprise that, with the effects of obesity making headlines and the overwhelming perfectionist drive of most Harvard students, people on campus like to work out. After a few days at the MAC, however, I realized that some people aren’t exercising solely for the physical benefits. Instead, health at Harvard has become just another arena in which students obsessively compete.
Some students direct their energies into maintaining the appearance of an intense workout rather than actually exercising, Every time I go to the gym, I brace myself for the scrutiny. As soon as I get on my elliptical, an energetic, spandex-clad girl will inevitably take the one next to me, her high ponytail bouncing along with her quick pace and absent resistance. She is clearly more focused on her appearance than actually exercising, and the pleasure she derives from running at her quickened tempo is immediately apparent from her almost pitying glances in my direction.
If she’s too busy shopping for new exercise attire that day, I often encounter a second type: those who note the pace of those around them and seek to go just a little faster. We all know the slightly older man attempting to look buff as he huffs and puffs amongst the row of women will take her place, or the woman in an over-sized T-shirt reaching the peak of her mountain trying to shed a few pounds. But no matter who it is, they all share one commonality—an inability to keep their eyes on their own monitor.
In the midst of this atmosphere, it is nearly impossible for me to focus on my own workout without getting the feeling that I’m somehow horribly behind. My neighbors’ peeks at my speed or calorie count are never quite as discreet as they think they are. After looking, my nosy fellow exerciser often either cranks up his resistance or speeds up his strides, or else smirks in the knowledge that he’s comfortably ahead.
Sadly, at Harvard, some students always feel the need to bring up the number of times they’ve gone to the MAC in daily conversation and then pause as if awaiting a reply. It’s clear that they would feel better if you confessed you had two midterms that day and did not have a chance to go. What should really make these students happy, though, is just the fact that they worked out.
But what provokes this imagined competition? Sure, some thrive on this struggle as a means of motivation, but this satisfaction could find other outlets. Join a sports team, play intramurals, or start a pickup basketball game. While the attitude of an incessant need to be better than everyone else is arguably justifiable in academics, where leadership positions are limited and internships are competitive, it cannot be translated into fitness.
On the exercise machines, there is no real place for any victory other than one over your own self. There’s nothing to lose in working out (except maybe weight); even though the person on the treadmill next to you might have hit the five-mile marker first, your own run was still a successful step on the path toward good health. It should be met with a sense of accomplishment, not defeat.
Besides, with the absence of cable in most Harvard dorm rooms, you should be using your time at the MAC to catch up on Top Chef, not staring at your neighbor’s calorie counter.

This week, it seems that drug pushers have infiltrated the Harvard campus. Boldly sporting “Say Yes to Drugs” shirts, their attire suggests that the elementary school program Drug Abuse Resistance Education has an expiration date. But these students don’t want pot or cocaine; they want global access to life-saving medications. The organization Universities Allied for Essential Medicines estimates that 10 million people die each year from curable diseases simply because they cannot afford the medicine they need.  In solidarity with those who suffer, the students aim to attack the root of this problem.
After obtaining patents, Harvard licenses a number of the technologies it develops in its labs, such as organic compounds, vaccines, and diagnostics, to biotech and pharmaceutical companies for development into finished products. At present, there is no institutionalized mechanism to guarantee that drugs created from university research can be produced generically. Allowing generic production breaks the temporary monopoly a pharmaceutical company holds on a product that is guaranteed by its patent. With more companies able to produce a product, free-market competition drives down its price, and as its cost decreases, more people gain access to the drug. At present, unless a Harvard scientist takes special initiative to include clauses that promote global access in the license of her compound, she essentially relinquishes control over the future of her research at the time of licensing. After this point, the pharmaceutical company has free reign over the cost of the drug, and global access is rarely a priority.
This system must change. Without a standardized means to require generic production of certain technologies, Harvard effectively endorses the needless death and suffering of millions of people in the developing world. Instead, when it licenses a compound to a biotech or pharmaceutical company, the university should mandate that the drug created from that compound be allowed to be produced generically in developing countries, a move that would inherently lower the drug’s price. 
According to Berkeley Law School Professor Amy Kapczynzki, enabling generic production would have minimal financial impact on universities and pharmaceutical companies. For example, in 2002, Africa comprised only 1.3 percent of the world pharmaceutical market, and Southeast Asia, China, and the Indian subcontinent comprised 6.7 percent.  These markets are so small that the profits rendered from them are insignificant, indicating that, at essentially no cost to the university, Harvard can make a groundbreaking step toward reducing the cost of essential medicines in poor countries and set an example for other universities to follow. 
Saying yes to drugs means institutionalizing a policy that recognizes access to medicines and health-related technologies for all as the primary purpose of development of health-related technology—that implements a system of technology development that ensures patients have access to the final end product they need, such as formulated pills or vaccines. It is systematic in its approach, sufficiently transparent to verify its effectiveness, and based on explicit metrics that measure the success of technology transfer by its impact on access and continued innovation; that removes legal barriers to generic production of Harvard technologies in resource-limited countries, using proactive licensing provisions to ensure that barriers such as follow-on patents and data exclusivity cannot be used to block such production.
As a world-leading research institution, Harvard is obligated to use the fruits of its labs to benefit those in need, regardless of their ability to pay. Harvard should measure the value of its research not by its profits but by the number of people whose lives it saves.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When conservatives decry our culture’s decline, they’re fooling you, liberals warn. “Conservatives are using moral panic over girls ‘going wild’ and pre-marital sex to distract from the problems that young women actually need help with,” Jessica Valenti, executive editor of Feministing.com, wrote in an e-mail. “I’m similarly concerned that people are being duped into supporting regressive gender politics.”
This newspaper agrees: Conservatives bash alternative lifestyles to win votes. “For close to a decade, the Republican Party has gotten considerable mileage out of a narrative of cultural conflict that pits a snobbish, educated, costal [sic] elite against the hard-working, god-fearing denizens of the country’s heartland,” The Crimson wailed in an editorial, “The Wrong War,” on September 9, 2008.
They’re wrong. Politicians exploit cultural differences, but conservatives’ concern with our culture, specifically the lack of two-parent households, is legitimate. 
Thomas Frank, author of “What’s the Matter with Kansas?”, contends that people should ignore issues like marriage and follow their economic self-interest, which aligns with Democratic policies. But people care about culture regardless of their finances. “It’s no less ridiculous to complain about evangelical Christians in Kansas voting for Republicans than to complain about movie stars in Hollywood voting for Democrats who will raise their taxes,” said Ross G. Douthat ’02, a columnist for The New York Times.
Liberals also worry about culture: They worry it’s too conservative. Stigmas on divorce and premarital sex seem oppressive. People should be able to live as they wish—liberals argue—without fear of neighbors’ disapproval. If conservatives stopped forcing their values onto others, people wouldn’t fight over the culture.
But every community promotes certain behaviors and discourages others. This campus, for instance, encourages efficiency. To embarrass students over their wastefulness, the Resource Efficiency Program piled trash eight feet high in front of the Science Center last November. This campus also urges “safe sex.” Last Halloween, Peer Contraceptive Counselors gave freshmen condoms and lubricant in festive goodie bags with the slogan, “Sex doesn’t have to be scary.” 
On this matter, liberals and conservatives clash. Harvard Right to Life, which opposes abortion, finds its posters torn down. The True Love Revolution, which advocates abstinence, was denied permission to hand out flyers outside “Sex Signals.” Both sides conflict because liberals say that no lifestyle is better than another, while conservatives argue that the traditional lifestyle—the two-parent household—when possible, is best. They do so not merely to criticize other living arrangements, but to highlight the traditional lifestyle’s advantages. 
Consider the evidence: Two people living apart require 56 percent more money to sustain themselves than two living together, according to national guidelines on poverty. Children also benefit. Sociologists Sara McLanahan and Gary Sandefur found that one third of children with divorced parents who participated in their study dropped out of high school, while one tenth of children from intact families did so. One third of their sample’s girls whose parents divorced became teenage mothers—triple the amount of girls from intact families.
These numbers require caveats. “It’s not as if once a poor couple marries, a money tree magically sprouts up in their backyard,” Valenti countered. And couples should separate if they have abusive relationships—those also harm children. Yet sociologists Paul Amato and Alan Booth note that two thirds of divorces do not stem from abusive relationships and the separations themselves traumatize children. This inquiry is not a search for the guilty, but an indicator that families are more than aesthetic arrangements.
Fine, liberals concede, but there’s no going back to 1960. No one wants to. But the two-parent household has rebounded recently—among the college-educated. Since the 1980s, divorce among them has fallen by 30 percent. Meanwhile, it has risen among the less educated by about six percent. Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institute, calls this difference a main driver of economic inequality. Why the two-parent household has become more popular among the college-educated and less so among other demographics is an important question—not a distraction.
In fact, some of the best adherents to the traditional lifestyle come from the Ivy League. Just 10 percent of couples whose children attend these schools get divorced. Harvard graduates “are much less likely to get divorced and less likely to have kids out of wedlock than the poor and working-class,” added Douthat. For proof that social conservatism—at least of a kind—is still relevant, look no further than your classmates. Those prudes.

After six days of campaigning, David E. Baumwoll and Ryan M. Androsoff were elected as student government president and executive vice president, respectively, of the Kennedy School last Thursday. Almost 70 percent of HKS students voted, according to Kennedy School Student Government (KSSG) Interim Chair and Chair of the Elections Committee Birgit E. Waidmann, “The election went very smoothly this year. We had a large number of candidates contesting the positions,” Waidmann said. Baumwoll, who ran against two other candidates, received 62.7 percent of the votes, and Androsoff received 68 percent of the votes. Despite running for different positions, Baumwoll and Androsoff campaigned together. “Since we worked on so much together last year and we had every intention to work together this year, it made sense for us to run together as a ticket, not compete against each other,” Androsoff said. Both candidates were student representatives last year. According to Androsoff, the two candidates had leadership roles focusing on two major issues facing HKS students—a “funding crunch” for international students who had decreased funding as a result of currency devaluation, and the lack of student input in the decision to eliminate some of the Kennedy School’s social space. In fact, Baumwoll authored the Student Government resolution this past summer which addressed student concerns after the Hauser Center for Non-Profit Organizations moved into a student social space known as Town Hall. “I think we’ll represent a paradigm shift at the Kennedy School in terms of student activism and participation in the way the school functions,” said Baumwoll. “Ryan and I are both ready and willing to lead our classmates into a better HKS experience.” Androsoff echoed his classmate’s sentiments. “In the campaign, one of the things we talked about was we all have the privilege of being one of the best schools of government in the world,” Androsoff said. “And we deserve a student government that’s worthy of that name.” Candidates for the positions of Academic Affairs Vice President and Finance Vice President did not secure the 50 percent of votes necessary to win. As a result, run-off elections will be held between Adam J. Cooper and Christopher Lawrence-Pietroni for Academic Affairs Vice President, and Ibrahim Kuzu and Naushard M. Cader for Finance Vice President. The 24 hour run-off election will begin Monday at 10 a.m. The new student government will be seated on Wednesday evening.

The Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2009, passed by the House of Representatives last week, will initiate several of the Obama administration’s promised changes in higher education accessibility. The bill will end subsidies to private lenders for student loans and will raise the Pell Grant limit—a federal need-based grant—from $4,731 to $6,900 by 2020. While the bill, if passed by the Senate, would have little effect on the financial aid packages students receive from Harvard, it could prove to be a helpful supplement to the admissions office’s ever-growing financial aid output. Due to the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative and additional admissions recruiting, the number of Pell Grant recipients at Harvard increased by 75 percent over the past 15 years, according to Senior Associate Director of Financial Aid Janet L. Irons. This number dwarfs the national average increase of 38 percent. Still, Harvard has been able to meet the full need of financial aid recipients even in the absence of the grants. This year, just $3 million of the $145 million the admissions office will award in financial aid will come from Pell Grant subsidies. But According to Irons this percentage could change if the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act is passed. “A 25 percent increase in the level of Pell Grant funding would certainly help us in this challenging economy,” Irons said. “But the reality is that we have made a fundamental commitment to our financial aid program, and have a long tradition of meeting the full need of our students regardless of the funding fluctuations of federal financial aid programs.”

The Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers will commence its eighth round of contract negotiations with University management this fall—a process that will address not only issues such as worker salaries and benefits, but also Harvard’s larger working environment. By October, union leaders will have initiated broad-based discussions within its 5,800-person organization about the state of their current workplace to prepare for formal contract negotiations with the University, according to HUCTW director Bill Jaeger. The current three-year contract expires on June 30, 2010. Jaeger said he expects the internal conversations to form the basis of “more urgent and formal” talks between union leaders and management toward the end of the calendar year, which will phase into substantive negotiations by February. “It’s a little bit too early to talk in any confident way about goals,” Jaeger said in an interview earlier this month. “We hope for a good agreement that really meets the needs of members of the union. It’s more important to have a good contract than an early or fast contract.” But Jaeger added that discussions will be “comprehensive” and may broach issues such as flexibility in scheduling, career mobility within the University, workplace organization and supervision, and the balance of work and time-off. He emphasized that negotiations will go beyond “economic issues.” Harvard spokesman Kevin Galvin, who often handles labor relations inquiries, wrote in an e-mailed statement that University negotiators are “proud” of their relationship with HUCTW, and that they hope for “productive” conversations with “the people who help to make [Harvard] one of the world’s premier institutions.” Jaeger said most union members would agree that the most successful contract negotiations occurred in 2007. The “productive and harmonious” round of talks led to improved benefits and salary increases for workers, and also overhauled the educational assistance program, which gives union members financial support and time off to continue their education. By contrast, the union had its worst round of talks with the University in 1992, according to Jaeger. The contract renegotiation—which became deadlocked over issues of employee compensation and benefits and required the intervention of an outside mediator—was not resolved until January of the following year. HUCTW ratified its first contract with Harvard in 1989, after a protracted struggle to gain recognition from the University. Between then and 2007, the union has achieved a 145% salary increase for workers, strengthened its work-security program, and worked to preserve full health benefits for part-time employees. —Staff writer Esther I.

A new Harvard study released last week found that an estimated 45,000 deaths each year are associated with a lack of health insurance coverage—a finding that is likely to bolster the case for health insurance reform currently being debated in Congress this fall. The study—conducted by researchers at Harvard Medical School and the Cambridge Health Alliance—represents the latest effort to gauge the effects of health insurance on Americans’ health. “People who don’t have access to [health] care tend to have more serious health outcomes. That is quite intuitive,” said Andrew P. Wilper, lead researcher. “However, our study quantifies the effects of not having health insurance on mortality.” Steffie Woolhandler, a co-author of the paper and a professor at Harvard Medical School, said that the results suggest that the 45,000 deaths were preventable. According to Woolhandler, 45 million Americans are currently uninsured. Both Wilper and Woolhandler said they hope that their results will have an impact on health policy makers. Several plans for health care are being debated in Congress, but according to Woolhandler, even the most liberal of the House bills, called HR3200, leaves 17 million Americans outside of the health care plan. “As a doctor, I believed that everyone deserves health care,” said Woolhandler. “It’s unacceptable to just leave 17 million people out of the system because the Senate and [House of] Representatives don’t have the backbone to stand up to the health insurance industry.” Data analyzed in this study was taken from NHANES III, a survey of Americans age 17 to 64 by the National Center for Health Statistics that started in 1988 and ended with a follow-up in 2000. Researchers adjusted the data for possible confounding factors such as age, gender, income, education, body mass index, and regular alcohol use and smoking. Even with taking into account for those factors that may affect mortality rate, the study found that uninsured Americans have a 40 percent higher risk of death than their counterparts. Robert J. Blendon, a professor of health policy and political analysis at the Harvard School of Public Health and Kennedy School of Government, calls the timing of this study “terrific” in aiding the cause for universal health insurance. “In the world of politics and policy, a study that comes out during the crisis of a debate that makes such a visible point on how people’s lives are lost is highly significant,” Blendon said. “It will cost billions of dollars to solve this problem, and for many people, we can’t afford to solve it,” he said. “But this study shows that it’s not about the money, it’s about lives. This is an issue we can’t afford not to solve.” But not everyone is as confident about this study’s potential influence. According to Amitabh Chandra, a professor of health policy at KSG, this observational study “failed to control for some obvious confounders.” He points out that not having insurance could be “a mask” for a host of causes of poor health such as living in a hazardous environment and engaging in risky behaviors. “We need studies that establish the causal effect between health insurance and health effects, and I’m not convinced that this study does that,” Chandra said. “While I don’t disagree with the study’s basic premise, this particular paper is pure advocacy, in an effort to get the biggest number possible,” he added. —Staff writer Helen X.

Professor Emeritus of Social Medicine Leon Eisenberg, a leader of Harvard Medical School’s affirmative action program, died last week at the age of 87. 
Arthur Kleinman, a colleague at the Medical School, called Eisenberg “one of Harvard’s greats,” and said that he would leave behind a legacy in both psychology and social activism. 
Eisenberg’s career was filled with ground breaking work in his attempts to integrate the study of disease with social experience, and he actively researched autism and attention-deficit hyperactive disorder. 
But colleagues said that Eisenberg would be most remembered for advancing social equality at the Medical School. 
Shortly after Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination in 1968, Eisenberg played a leading role in establishing the Medical School’s affirmative action program to help underrepresented groups, according to Neurobiology Professor Edward A. Kravitz.
Kravitz began working with Eisenberg on this issue and remembered Eisenberg’s boldness when designing an affirmative action policy for the Medical School. The portion of minority students at the school increased to 20 percent of the class, according to Kravitz.
Alvin F. Poussaint, a professor at the Medical School, said that Eisenberg was most proud of his accomplishment of expanding the Medical School to include underrepresented groups. 
Kleinman added that Eisenberg was “extraordinarily generous in assisting young scholars in finding financial support for their research and projects,” and that he pushed to improve ethical standards at the Medical School. 
Kleinman said that Eisenberg advocated strict guidelines for faculty members accepting monetary endorsements from pharmaceutical companies because he felt that conflicting interests would be dangerous for the Medical School.  
“He was an extremely courageous man who was not afraid to speak out,”  said Kleinman. 
Colleagues said that Eisenberg’s social activism and innovations in his field were fueled by his intense intellectual curiosity.  
As a testament to Eisenberg’s brilliance and dynamism, Kleinman remembered one instance when Eisenberg had been conversing with a renowned ecologist about the behavior of speckled trout at a medical conference in the early seventies, only to be mistaken for an ecologist and not a psychologist.
“Leon was an absolute brilliant scholar who read widely across many fields in a way that is more usual in the past than it is today,” said Kleinman.

The Harvard Square Business Association held its First Annual Urban-Agricultural Fair at Winthrop Park in Cambridge yesterday, in an effort to celebrate locally-grown Cambridge produce and goods. The grassy area located in front of Peet’s Coffee Shop dates back to 1635 and was the location of the first marketplace in Newtowne, the city that predated Cambridge.  The event, which lasted from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., featured cooking demonstrations, recipe sampling, and advising information and drew over 30 participating vendors and organizations. Fair-goers were exposed to a wide range of local businesses that offered specialized knowledge and shared strategies to facilitate the process of urban produce-growing. Jessie Banhazl, owner of Green City Growers, discussed the use of raised bed produce farms, as small as 4x4 feet in size, as a means to address typical city limitations of space availability. Raised beds furthermore address the issue of soil toxicity in an urban environment, Banhazl said. The fair also hosted a urban-agriculture goods contest, with medals awarded to the best fruit, pickled vegetable, vegetable, flower, baked goods and soup entries. “The best vegetable that I saw today was a huge brussels sprout that was very impressive because of its sheer size alone,” said celebrity judge Chris Durkin, who is director of membership and community relations for Harvest Co-op Markets.  Both attendees and organizers said that they were pleased with how the event turned out.  “I couldn’t be happier with how everything went,” said HSBA executive director Denise Jillson, who oversaw the organization of the fair. “People always love to be in Harvard Square and here is a really fun event where you learn about so many different things—from composting to growing your own garden to chicken roosting.” Cambridge City Councillor Henrietta Davis said that she was impressed by the size of the crowd, adding that she hoped it would encourage locals to be more involved in their communities.  “It’s great because it’s the first only one and there are so many people,” she said. “I can’t wait to see what this fair will look like in years to come.” Fair-goer Rebecca J. Cohen ’12 said that she thought the event reflected the community’s heightened focus on sustainable and thoughtful farming.  “It’s not just a fringe belief; people are really trying to support it,” she said.

NEWTON, Mass.–The Harvard women’s soccer team was able to achieve something that no other team had done against No. 4 Boston College (7-0-0) all season—but it just wasn’t enough for a win. Despite knocking home a goal on the vaunted Eagles defense, which had not allowed a score in its first six games of the year, the Crimson (1-4-1) was overpowered by its hosts, falling on the road Friday evening by a tally of 4-1. “That’s a really good team that we just played,” co-captain Lizzy Nichols said. “And I really felt that we finally brought the emotion and intensity we need to match a team like that.” “I was very pleased with how we played,” Harvard coach Ray Leone added. “Effort was good, speed of play was really good. BC brought a lot out of us, and we really responded in a good way.” The pace of the match opened up in the latter minutes of the first half, and the Crimson was able to take advantage of the faster style of play, attempting its only two shots of the period. BC had 11 during the frame. With about nine minutes left until intermission and Harvard down 2-0, sophomore Melanie Baskind found a sprinting Alexandra Conigliaro from about 20 yards out. The freshman forward took a solid shot on net, but the Eagles’ goalie, sophomore Jillian Mastroianni, made the save. Conigliaro was not to be denied again, as she made another push in the 40th minute. The rookie delivered a short pass to Baskind in the box, who laid it ahead for teammate Katherine Sheeleigh. Finding herself with the ball and no one to beat but the netminder, the all-Ivy junior forward knew exactly what to do. She blasted a shot high into the net over Mastroianni, getting the Crimson back into the match. The score broke BC’s streak of almost 580 minutes without allowing a goal, and although a Harvard corner kick with time winding down was cleared, it was apparent that the road team had received a boost in confidence. The late surge could not have come at a more optimal time for the Crimson, which desperately needed to bounce back from an early two-goal deficit, brought about by a sister act that had befuddled the Crimson. Just eight minutes into the game, Eagles co-captain Gina DiMartino made a 10-yard run and launched a rocket from 25 yards out to give her team the early lead. Less than two minutes later, BC would find the twine again, when DiMartino delivered a through ball to her sibling—freshman Victoria DiMartino—who slid the ball past Harvard senior keeper Lauren Mann. A member of the U-20 US women’s national team, the younger DiMartino leads her team in goals and points. But the Crimson did manage to slow down its opponent’s potent offense for the rest of the half and looked to carry momentum over into the final 45 minutes. “Just the emotion and feeling inside of the locker room during halftime, you could really feel that we are in this game—we were excited, we were having fun, we were achieving the goals we set out for ourselves,” Nichols said. But hopes of a comeback were foiled early on. The Eagles came out firing, forcing Mann into a save 22 seconds in, and they did not let up. The crowd of just over 600 fans witnessed an impressive performance by the Harvard keeper, who had a season-high 12 saves, many of which were worthy of a highlight reel. Victoria DiMartino let a particularly vicious shot fly in the 61st minute, but a crouching Mann leapt to her right to make a spectacular stop. “[Mann} was exciting...she kept us in the game,” Leone said. “She should be feeling really good about her performance tonight.” Mann’s efforts couldn’t hold off the relentless attack of BC forever, and the home team turned the tide for good with lethal counterattacks after failed Crimson offensive attempts. With twenty minutes left to play, a diving Kristen Mewis put a header off a cross into the near post for a 3-1 lead, and Victoria DiMartino gave her team a three-goal edge on her eighth score of the season at 75:57. A free kick by Nichols would be the only shot for Harvard the rest of the way. BC held the edge in shots on goal, 16-3, for the game. Having competed with one of the most talented teams in the nation, the Crimson came away encouraged, rather than disappointed. “They had good goals, but I’m proud of the way we put it out there,” Nichols said. “I think it gives us really good preparation for the Ivy League because that’s the kind of emotion that it takes to play a game.” —Staff writer Dennis J.

As summer came to an official end this past weekend, so too did a losing streak. Just not Harvard’s. On Sunday night at Nickerson Field across the river, Boston University (3-4-2) gave the Crimson (1-5-1) another preseason loss in front of 244 fans and those watching on Fox Soccer Channel. For Harvard, Sunday was a chance to end the preseason on a good note after losing three games in a row—including Friday’s 4-1 beating at the hands of No. 4 Boston College. The Terriers felt the same way. Coming off of its own three-game losing streak against Connecticut, No. 23 Pennsylvania State, and Northeastern, BU proved that it wanted to win, shutting out the Crimson, 1-0. “[We] struggled, fought through it, really responded at the end of the game, so I was proud of them for that, but we need to have a commitment to come in and play all 90 [minutes],” said Harvard coach Ray Leone. Commitment seemed hard for both teams in the beginning of the first half, with the lone goal coming 32 minutes into the game. BU sophomore Jessica Luscinski took a shot on goal that was deflected by a Crimson defender. But the ball failed to clear far enough, and Terrier freshman Megan McGoldrick charged in, shooting her first career goal past the fingertips of Harvard senior Lauren Mann. Mann stopped three more attempts in the first half, as BU outshot the Crimson, 8-3, for the half. One goal down, Harvard attempted to tie it up a minute later with a shot by senior Christina Hagner, but it bounced right into the hands of Terrier goalie Janie Reilly to end the half. “I think we adjusted our system and came back out [in the second half] ready to go, ready to play,” said Mann. “Personally, everyone knew what changes they needed to make and what the team needed to do as a whole.” The one big opportunity for the Crimson to even up play came in the second half with 18 minutes left. Freshman Alexandra Conigliaro shot a pass to team-goal leader Katherine Sheeleigh, who booted it toward the net, and Reilly’s fingertips which managed to knock the ball out. “At the end, they were flooding players forward,” BU goalkeeper Reilly said. “The whole [Terriers] defensive team did a great job holding them off from being completely bombarded.” BU continued to withstand the bombardment as Harvard senior co-captain Gina Wideroff headed the ball over the Terrier’s cross bar. Later in the half, BU tried to double its score, but Mann’s five total saves of the night stopped the Terriers and put her 11 saves away from being 4th on Harvard’s all-time career list. Despite Mann’s saves, BU outshot the Crimson, 15-7, during the match. Opponents have outscored Harvard, 14-6, this season. “We know we need to come off with more intensity, more energy,” Mann said. “We need to fly off the line right from the get-go, because when you get to the Ivy League, you want to get ahead.” At 0-4 on the road this preseason, Harvard is looking forward to playing at home next weekend as it opens up Ivy League play against the Penn, which has dominated the Crimson the past two years. “I don’t think anybody is thrilled being 1-5-1 but we are starting over now,” Leone said. “Learn from this experience, and start over on Saturday. They are a resilient group, and I trust in this team very much.” —Staff writer Alex Sopko can be reached at sopko@fas.harvard.edu.

After starting the season 3-0 for the first time since 2005, the Harvard field hockey team was unable to carry its momentum into the first half of its Ivy League opener against Yale on Saturday. The Bulldogs (3-2, 1-0 Ivy) used their speed and drive to mark up a 4-0 halftime lead and managed to withstand a strong Crimson (3-1, 0-1) comeback to secure the 4-3 victory. 
Harvard had only allowed four goals in its first three games of the season, but Yale jumped on top quickly with two goals in the first ten minutes en route to its 4-0 halftime lead.  
The Crimson was outshot, 9-2, in the first frame, and it looked as if Harvard’s chances of matching its best season start in the past five years was in serious jeopardy. 
“We really got caught off guard by their speed,” said co-captain Elizabeth Goodman-Bacon. “It really took those first 35 minutes to get our act together.  We needed to make some organizational changes at halftime and spend some time to reset and talk about what was happening.”
Harvard started to inch closer in the second half, when Goodman-Bacon notched her first goal of the season almost halfway through the second frame. Junior Chloe Keating continued her career season when her sixth goal of the season cut the Crimson’s deficit to 4-2. 
But Yale’s defense stood firm, and its first-half surge proved all the offense it needed, as sophomore Carly Dickson’s goal on a penalty corner as time expired left the final score at 4-3. 
“I think everyone was a bit nervous and jumpy at the beginning since it was our first Ivy game,” said co-captain Kristin Bannon. “We have to make sure we come to play our next game with a stronger start and more drive. They came out really fast, and we were definitely thrown off.” 
“We knew we had to make some adjustments, but we were really determined after the half to close the scoring gap,” she added.
Yale dominated in almost every facet of the game. Although the Crimson outscored the Bulldogs, 3-0, in the second half, those were the only three shots Harvard was able to get off in that frame. 
After leading in shots on goal in each of its first three games this season, the Crimson was outshot by Yale, 18-5, in this contest.  
The Crimson also managed to allow nine penalty corners by the Bulldogs to Harvard’s four. 
Despite the Bulldogs’ first-half performance, freshman goalkeeper Cynthia Tassopoulos stood strong with eight saves for the game, including six in Harvard’s second-half comeback run. 
“We were really proud of our second half, but we need to learn how to play a complete game at a good tempo,” Goodman-Bacon said. “Yale came out looking strong, and it definitely took us a while to adjust. We are going to have to get better at that throughout the season.”
“Especially when we are playing these games against competitive teams, everyone knows it’s going to be important to learn how to play seventy minutes as a team,” Goodman-Bacon continued.
Looking ahead to Wednesday’s game at No. 7 Connecticut (7-0), the Crimson wants to make sure that this disappointing loss doesn’t hinder the body of work it has achieved with its strong start to the season.
“I think that our first couple of games were successful because we really weren’t challenged too much,” Bannon said.  “The rest of the season we’re going to be playing better teams, and the games will be a lot tougher, so we really need to make some adjustments and get used to playing faster and more complete games.”

A common fear among athletes successful in their debut seasons is falling into a “sophomore slump,” but so far the Harvard cross-country team appears to be immune.The Crimson men and women had markedly different results at the Iona College Meet of Champions—held at Van Cortland Park in Riverdale N.Y. on Saturday morning—but both squads enjoyed strong performances from a number of sophomores, and a rookie, to kick off the fall season.Four Harvard women crossed the line in the top six to lead the Crimson to a first-place finish, while second-year runner Dan Stiles headed a men’s squad that earned 14th.“I thought it was a good opening race,” Stiles said. “We didn’t run some of our top guys, but the people that did run did well. It was great just to get our feet moving.”Indeed both the men and women competed without their best athletes, as none of the team captains hit the course. Senior Chas Gillespie, junior Dan Chenowith and juniors Jamie Olson and Claire Richardson all sat out on Saturday, but the women’s squad proved undaunted, as Harvard dominated the field.Freshman Sammy Silva won the women’s 6k race in 22:35.43, giving her an 18-second margin of victory in her first race for the Crimson.“I think she did really well,” sophomore Jeanne Mack said. “In her first collegiate race, she came out with a bang. It was impressive, and I’m excited about her as a member of the team.”Mack led a trio of second-years—including Kailyn Kuzmuk and Nicole Cochran—that finished just behind Silva to give Harvard a strong lead pack. All three runners managed a pace of 6:15 or better, and Mack was less than two seconds behind second-place finisher Alexandra Lizzarib of Kent State. Senior Caitlin Clifford finished 29th to round out the top five and give Harvard its best ever finish at the Meet of Champions.While the Crimson youth clearly had a hand in the team’s win, Harvard coach Jason Saretsky also gave credit to the seniors, who provided a key veteran presence.“I’m pleased with how the team performed,” Saretsky said. “We had a number of upperclassmen out there and the seniors that did compete, especially on the women’s side, did a great job.”Considering that the Crimson’s two strongest runners are juniors, it appears that the squad can anticipate significant contributions throughout its roster. For the sophomores, Mack expressed excitement at the opportunity to make more of an impact this season.“I know a lot of the [second-year runners] are feeling a lot better,” she said. “After a good, hard summer of training, we’re ready to improve on last year’s individual performances and as a team. We’re raring to go.”Harvard’s men had a less compelling performance at historic Van Cortland Park.Stiles led the way for the Crimson in the 8k race, finishing in 27:06.51 to earn 62nd overall, followed by a pair of rookies in Kevin Sprague and Jakob Lindaas, who finished only five seconds apart. Senior Bobby Kenney and junior Mark Hirschboeck maintained a 5:36 and 5:37 pace, respectively, to complete Harvard’s top five.“A lot of guys ran pretty good races, but I think we’ll have better races in the future,” Stiles conceded.Still, with many of the team’s top runners resting, Saretsky showed little concern with the mediocre results, instead highlighting the benefit of experiencing a course that the Crimson will run twice more this season.“[Van Cortland Park] was a little different this year because of some construction,” Saretsky said. “It helps to see the course and get a good feel for it before we go back to race there in four weeks time. I think we’ll be ready for the Ivy Championships.”It only remains to be seen how such a race will shape up after Harvard unveils the full strength of its roster next week. —Staff writer Max N.

The beautiful skies of St. Helena, Calif. provided the Harvard men’s tennis team with the ambience to challenge tough opponents and see how they could fare in the upcoming season. The Crimson attended the Land Rover Napa Valley Tennis Classic, a round robin tournament that featured three strong teams from around the nation: UC Berkeley, University of Michigan (No. 33 in the nation last year), and University of Mississippi (No. 4 at the end of last season). These high-ranking opponents gave Harvard the tests needed to diagnose their problems in order to build on last season.   “The tournament bodes well for us this season,” sophomore Mac McAnulty said. “Ole Miss was top-ranking last year and we played well against them. We showed some skills in doubles and a lot of the guys got some good wins in the singles.” The first day of the tournament turned out favorably for McAnulty and junior Aba Omodele-Lucien, while five other Harvard players lost to their opponents. McAnulty bounced back from losing the first set, 6-4, to overtake Cal sophomore Sky Lovill, 6-2, 7-6(3). Omodele-Lucien established dominance over Mississippi sophomore Chris Thiemann after winning a close set, 7-5, wrapping up the win with a 6-2 set.  Sophomore David Mangham lost an evenly matched contest against UC Berkeley junior Bozhidar Katsarov, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4. Another close contest of the day was junior Alexei Chijoff-Evans’ match against Ole Miss senior Kalle Norberg, even though the result didn’t go the Crimson’s way. After taking a close first set, Chijoff-Evans dropped the second set, 6-1, and then lost a heartbreaker, 7-5. The close contest showed that the unanimous All-Ivy first-team pick in singles from last season still had some work to do but could keep up with a difficult adversary. “Top guys played very well and Alexei almost took Norberg from Ole Miss,” said Omodele-Lucien. “So it’s good, especially at the beginning of season, to play tough opponents because people are rusty, and its good to come to the tourney and get hot right away.” On day two of the round robin, Katsarov once again faced another Harvard player, this time falling to Omodele-Lucien, 6-7 6-3 7-6. Chijoff-Evans also proved victories as he faced the Golden Bears’ Riki McLachlan, defeating him in two sets, 6-2 6-4. McAnulty wasn’t so lucky in his second match of the tournament, losing to Cal sophomore Tommie Murphy. McAnulty took a tough first set, 5-7, before losing the next two, 6-3, 6-1. Mangham also lost, dropping his second straight game of the Classic, this time to Cal freshman Christoffer Konigsfeldt, 6-3, 6-2. Sunday proved to be a pivotal day for Crimson players as they faced some experienced competitors. McAnulty beat senior Bijan Hejazi of UC Berkeley, 7-6, 6-3, a player who had won numerous accolades at UC Santa Barbara before transferring in January of this year.  Chijoff-Evans won against Mississippi sophomore Marcel Thiemann in a decisive contest towards the latter two sets, 6-1, 7-6, 10-8. The last set was played as a super tiebreaker due to Ole Miss’ early departure from the tournament. Omodele-Lucien dropped his final game of the tournament against senior Michael Sroczynski of Michigan, 6-4, 6-4.  “Overall, the team played very well this weekend,” said Chijoff-Evans. “We had some really good showing. Mac beat Bijan, who beat our number one three years ago, so it’s a great win. David Mangham played really well but got unlucky against Katsarov. The team looks strong even though the entire team wasn’t here.” The Harvard men’s tennis team was without two top freshmen due to injury,  which let several other players on the roster to take part in the Classic. It allowed the Crimson to assess their depth and figure out which players could play major roles this year. “It was a beautiful weekend, and the guys got a good chance to cut their teeth against the best teams across the country,” assistant coach Andrew Rueb said. “That kind of competition is invaluable when you get to see what you can work on and figure out what you can do to compete against the best.”—Staff writer Brian A.

Bethpage is synonymous with golf. The host of the 2002 and 2009 U.S. Open—the former witnessing a strong late-tournament surge by Phil Mickelson, only to finish three strokes back of Tiger Woods—Bethpage seems a fitting place to kick off the 2009 campaign for Harvard men’s golf. Channeling the prowess of the golf legends who had walked the course before them, the Crimson improved on last year’s ninth-place finish by placing fifth—tied with host St. John’s—in the 18-school field.“It was a very successful weekend, a great start to the season,” sophomore Mark Pollak said. “[We] continued the great run we had at the end of last year and pushed it into this year.”The tournament was played on the Red course—not the Black course where the U.S. Open is traditionally held—but the significance of the whole Bethpage State Park was not lost on the Harvard golfers.“It’s really neat, because it’s a really interesting place as far as golf history goes,” Pollak said. “We went over to some of the Black course holes, and we were like ‘Woah, remember when Phil [Mickelson] made this shot here or Tiger [Woods] made this shot there?’ You can definitely feel the history. It definitely feels like a more prestigious event.”Highlighting the weekend was the play of senior Greg Shuman, who finshed in a three-way tie for the tournament title. Shuman shot one under in the first round of play, shooting a 69 on the par-70 course. He then followed it up with a -2 in the second round, vying with Towson’s Nyasha Mauchaza, who was four under after two rounds, and UNC-Wilmington’s Stefan Brewer at five under.But Shuman held on in the final round of play, shooting at +1, while Mauchaza and Brewer went +2 and +4, respectively.“Overall, I thought I played well,” Shuman said. “I definitely hit the ball particularly well. I just plotted my way around and tried not to make a lot of big mistakes.”The remaining Crimson contingent included regular stalwarts as well as a fresh face. Pollak and classmate Tony Grillo tied for the 18th spot—along with Johnson & Wales’ Jordan Meltzer—at +4 on the weekend. Grillo was up one stroke on Pollak after the first round (68-69), before the two switched spots (74-73), and then finished the tournament matched at 72.Local boy Max Campion etched a spot for himself on the roster in his debut campaign. The rookie finished in a four-way tie at 64th. Shooting +13, Campion did exactly what his teammates were hoping he’d do.“I think Max is a really good player, and he’s going to continue to get better,” Shuman said. “It’s definitely difficult adjusting to college. I think he’s going to be a very good player over the next four years.”Rounding out the group was senior Danny Mayer, who finished in a five-way tie for 72nd, shooting +15.For a team that finished ninth last year and dead last two years ago, Harvard is looking forward to making noise this year.“This tournament shows the improvement we’ve made over the last two years,” Pollak said.Both Pollak and Shuman stressed the importance of beating Dartmouth and Princeton, the other two Ivy schools participating at the tournament.“We’re always happy to compete against the other Ivy League [schools] because it tells us where we’re at and where the other schools are at,” Pollak said. “[Our] confidence builds throughout the year, so hopefully when we go into Ivies, we know that we’ve beaten them before and hopefully can translate that into the Ivy schedule.”“Overall for the weekend, I think we have a lot of positive things to say,” Shuman added. “We beat the only two other Ivies there. Definitely positive.” —Staff writer Dixon McPhillips can be reached at fmcphill@fas.harvard.edu.

Last year, the Harvard women’s golf team relied on a string of individual victories to carry the team to Ivy League dominance. This year, the Crimson still carries the threat of solo wins, but has now bolstered the lineup with more reliable scorers. And while the squad may have slipped a spot from last year’s finish at the Princeton Invitational—second, down from first—this year’s showing offers several clues indicating another successful campaign for the Harvard golfers.Leading the way for the Crimson was sophomore Christine Cho. Her score of +4 was good enough for a share of second place individually on the par-72 course. Last year’s Ivy League Player of the Year, Cho shows no signs of slowing down, and according to her teammates, she’s only getting better.“I have the theory that everyone plays their best golf in their sophomore year,” captain Claire Sheldon said, adding that upperclassmen have a lot of other things going on, and freshmen are still getting used to college. “We continue to look to [Christine] to help lead us.”And though her teammates spoke highly of her play, Cho said she realized that she could have done more.“I had a good round the first day, and then the second day, I struggled a little bit,” Cho said. “So it was kind of frustrating, because I knew I could have done better...Because I played last, it sort of felt like I should bring in our score...To not have a great finish doesn’t feel so good.”Junior Mia Kabasakalis came in at +7 at the end of the two-round tournament, good for a share of sixth place, while Sheldon took a piece of the 12th spot, shooting +10 on the weekend.Noticeably absent from the Harvard roster was rookie Katie Sylvan. Her 28th-place finish at last week’s Golfweek Challenge helped the Crimson take seventh in the deep field of competition in Nevada. But having been away from school eight of the last ten days due to the women’s golf team’s difficult early-season schedule, Sylvan needed to balance out her academics.“She’s going to be a huge force,” Sheldon said of Sylvan. “But she needed to get some class. We’re trying to do what we can on the road, but it’s difficult. We look forward to having her back in the lineup next week. She had to do what needs to get done.”Filling in for Sylvan this weekend was sophomore Jane Lee. The Alamo, Calif. native finished +12 on the weekend—good enough for fourth best on the team—and tied for 18th on the individual leaderboard.Despite finishing second to Rollins College, the Harvard women were thrilled to best their Ivy opponents—Princeton and Penn—who also participated in the weekend tournament. Princeton finished third and Penn finished fourth.“It’s always good to do well when you’re playing your peers, in particular,” Sheldon said. “It’s nice to come out on top of those teams...One day, one weekend, weird things can happen. That’s what we saw from Princeton. The first round, they shot a ridiculously high score...It’s definitely not the kind of thing we can take for granted. Just because we were really successful last year, we can’t assume we’ll be like that again.”But the Crimson feels confident that, with all it’s regular starters in the lineup, the weekend’s result would have been different.“It’s nice because it definitely gives us confidence,” Cho said of beating Princeton and Penn. “And we know that our team is capable of beating them with our recruits [like Sylvan and classmate Chloe Atlchek]. We know we have the skills.”Rounding out the Crimson lineup, senior Sarah Harvey notched a +13, good for a share of 30th on the individual leaderboard.Now heading into the rest of the season, Sheldon and the rest of the Harvard women’s squad have high hopes for repeat dominance of the league.“Hopefully we can keep on going with the results that we’ve had,” Sheldon said.—Staff writer Dixon McPhillips can be reached at fmcphill@fas.harvard.edu.

Harvard women’s tennis continued to establish itself as one of the teams to beat in the Ivy League with victories in doubles and singles play at this weekend’s Harvard Fall Classic at the Robert M. Beren Tennis Center. The Crimson showcased its young talent with another outstanding individual performance from freshman Hideko Tachibana, who won both the Flight A doubles and singles championship. Players from Harvard, Boston College, Boston University, as well as the University of Texas at San Antonio took to the courts on Friday with first rounds of doubles and singles and continued through to the semifinals on a cool and blustery Saturday that served as an early taste of fall weather. On Sunday morning, finals for the doubles and singles brackets rounded out tournament play. Crimson individuals set themselves up for success with solid first round performances in Flight A singles on Friday afternoon. Fourth-seeded freshman Kristin Norton defeated Boston University opponent Monika Mical in three sets, 2-6, 6-2, 6-1. Junior Agnes Sibilski overpowered her UTSA competitor Vivian Carrillo in straight sets, 6-0, 6-4, and second-seeded Tachibana followed suit, eliminating her Terrier opponent, Petra Santini, 6-1, 6-0.  In the quarterfinals, Norton had an easier time, as she downed her UTSA opponent Caroline Dedering, 6-2, 6-1. While Tachibana continued her perfect season and advanced to the semifinals, Sibilski ran into Alex Kelleher of BC, who emerged with a 7-5, 6-3 victory. Tachibana avenged Sibilski’s loss with a 6-2, 6-2 ousting of Kelleher in the semifinals. But Norton’s run came to an end when she fell 6-2, 6-3 to first-seeded Stefanie Nunic of BU. Norton rebounded in the 3rd place match, earning a 6-4, 6-1 win. With her undefeated season on the line in the singles championship, Tachibana closed out the weekend’s play with a decisive win over Nunic. Tachibana had some trouble in the first set but shut out her opponent in the second, winning 6-4, 6-0.  It was a competitive match but one the Crimson freshman controlled.“I knew [Nunic] was supposed to be a very good player,” Tachibana said. “The team motivated me and the crowd cheered me on, and that helped a lot.”Harvard’s doubles teams had similarly strong performances. The freshman-sophomore combination of Alex Lehman and Samantha Gridley defeated UTSA’s Caroline Dedering and Vivian Carillo, 8-5, in the opening round. In the second round, the tandem made an 8-3 statement win against the first-seeded team of Nunic and Francine Whu from BU.Meanwhile, junior Samantha Rosekrans and Tachibana won a tough first-round battle versus Boston University’s Monika Mical and Liz Corroa, 9-8. In the next match, the two took down the fourth-seed, 8-5, and in an all-Harvard semifinal, Rosekrans and Tachibana defeated Lehman and Gridley, 8-2. Rosekrans and Tachibana then breezed through the championship against Boston College’s Katharine Attwell and Brittany Delaney, winning 8-3. “They were the same people who beat out Agnes [Sibilski] and [sophomore] Holly Cao yesterday so we were able to take revenge,” Rosekrans said. Cao and Sibilski fell 8-2 in the second round, despite being the two seed. In Flight B singles, Lehman had an impressive weekend, coming away with the tournament championship. Lehman dominated, dropping just seven games in three matches. The Boston College Eagles and Boston University Terriers are regular season opponents for the Crimson and are normally tough matches. The win over these rival schools should bring confidence to Harvard’s team as the season moves along. “It’s pretty clear that we are the better team,” Rosekrans said. “So it’s pretty reassuring early on. We are probably the most feared Ivy Leauge team. We have a target on our backs, but that just gives us more reason to practice.”The Harvard women face their next competition at the Air Force Invitational in Colorado Springs, CO from Oct. 2nd-4th.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For a new collegiate runner, no one knew what to expect from a rookie heralding from a small Catholic high school in California. But Samantha Silva appeared to be more than comfortable at center-stage as she claimed first place in the Iona College Meet of Champions over the weekend. Silva mustered up an extra burst of energy to close the race with a stellar 22:35.41 and lead her teammates to victory.The Crimson women outran Ivy rivals Penn and Yale at the famed New York City cross country course, Van Cortlandt Park, and bested nationally ranked No. 21 Wisconsin.Silva led the effort by winning her first ever race over 6 kilometers at the hilly venue. Her 18-second victory helped the team to its best finish at the meet in the 15-year history of the event.Singularly, Silva had a remarkable race. Yet, she is quick to credit the solidarity of the team as her motivation for accomplishing this feat.“Running with the team is awesome,” says Silva. “It makes everything so much easier, and I look forward to going to practice every day with them. It never feels like work at all, it’s just fun.”As Silva dominated the competition, a trio of Harvard sophomores finished closely behind. Jeanne Mack placed third, while Kailyn Kuzmuk and Nicole Cochran were fifth and sixth, respectively.Such strong performances from the first and second-year runners bode well for Crimson coach Jason Saretsky’s squad.Whereas many freshman athletes experience difficulties transitioning into collegiate sports, Silva displays a confidence in her running that has not gone unnoticed by her teammates.“She is very independent, and she knows what she’s doing,” junior captain Jamie Olson says. “She’s adjusting well with school and a new environment, and she just has an awesome attitude toward the world.”“She’s confident in her self,” echoes junior teammate Claire Richardson, “and it shows in her race that she’s confident and doing well.”Though extremely focused and determined on winning her races, Silva is described as being “lighthearted” and “having a lot of spirit.” “I’ve never seen her downtrodden,” Olson adds.Silva readily concedes that the most significant factor in her successful race was the training she received from her young head coach.“It’s really easy to confide in [Saretsky], and he works with you one on one,” Silva says. “I trust him to give me the right training that I need.”Saretsky is extremely pleased with Silva’s performance on Saturday, noting that the rookie’s hard work has paid off.“I knew she was talented, but she exceeded my expectations,” he says. “She never holds back in workouts, and she always wants to push herself harder.”Saretsky, however, concedes that there will be many challenges to overcome.“There’s still a lot of transitioning to be done and a lot of work ahead to get to the level that Sammy wants to be, because she has such high goals,” he says.And, indeed, Silva is expected to reach and surpass many of the goals that she will set for herself. The Harvard women will compete again on October 2 against rival Yale at Franklin Park in Boston.When asked what enabled her to give it her all towards the end of the race on Saturday, Silva answered with a simple yet heartfelt response that reflects her passion for cross country and her dedication towards her team.“Before the race, I think of all the training I’ve put it in, and I feel that I owe it to myself and my team to put my hardest work in,” Silva says.And with a work ethic like this, Silva promises to have many stellar performances to complement her first showing.

Two small stops on the Red Line, one giant leap for Harvard Baseball. That is what the Crimson is hoping for as it welcomes volunteer assistant coach Kristaps Aldins, previously a coach at MIT. During his stay as a coach for the Engineers, the MIT baseball team set a program-record for wins in 2008 with 25 and reached the NEWMAC Championship Game for the first time in 2006. As a player at Vassar College, Aldins had similar success. Aldins’ graduating class was the winningest group in school history. Individually, Aldins led the way, setting seven single-season Brewer records as well as the career record for doubles. Harvard believes Aldins can bring his winning ways to this end of Cambridge. “After two sub par seasons, he’ll help us win,” said sophomore pitcher and outfielder Brent Suter. Crimson head coach Joe Walsh has known about Aldins for a while through the Harvard baseball camp and the close relationship between the Crimson and MIT baseball programs. For Walsh, Aldins was an easy choice. “He’s a real go-getter, a young guy [with] a lot of enthusiasm,” Walsh said. Interestingly enough, it was budget cuts in the athletic department that allowed the hiring to happen. “We have always had a JV program,” Walsh said. “Recently JV moved to a club sport, which we think will be a good thing. JV had a coach, and we were always one man down. Now we are able to have a fourth spot. This is the first time we can add a third assistant.” According to junior captain Tyler Albright, many of the Harvard players already had a relationship with Aldins, often because they looked at both Harvard and MIT. One of these players was Suter, who said his interactions with Aldins tempted him to play for the Engineers. “[Aldins is] a great addition, a great guy [who] really knows how to translate his baseball knowledge,” Suter said. “He ran an outfield drill for us, and in one day, we got a ton better as an outfield. We were all talking about it afterwards.” The close relationship between MIT and Harvard makes it so that Aldins’ departure was not one of bitterness. “We stole him from MIT, but the schools have a very good relationship,” Walsh said. Operating in separate divisions, the schools are more like collaborators than competitors. According to Walsh, he always alerts MIT coach Andy Barlow if, while recruiting, he comes across players who could be a good fit for the Engineers. Likewise, Walsh says, if the MIT coaches see someone heading for Division I, they tell Walsh and his staff. “We can get out across the country and recruit, more than Division III,” Walsh said. “So if we go places and see people who would be a good fit for MIT, we let them know.” Such cooperation is helpful for two academically-oriented schools competing with institutions with fewer restrictions. “With the way recruiting spirals, the pace has picked up,” Walsh said. “We play some schools who are already getting commitments from 2011s—high school juniors.” With an additional coach, the Crimson hopes the management of the all-consuming recruiting process will improve. “[Aldins is] a great recruiter who will bring in great talent...in years to come,” Suter said. Aldins reciprocates the feeling of excitement, saying that he jumped at the opportunity to coach for Harvard. According to Aldins, taking the job was a “really easy decision.” Having known Walsh and the Harvard staff well during his time at MIT, Aldins had been looking for the opportunity to coach for the Crimson. Aldins emphasized his excitement about the team’s talent, particularly on the pitching staff. “[The team is] a great group of guys [who have been] very welcoming,” Aldins said. To improve his coaching ability, Aldins has been working toward a master’s degree in Sports Leadership at Northeastern. “Coaching is something I want to continue and do for a living,” Aldins said. “I think the program is going to help me become a better coach, and having a master’s degree will help me in the future.”

Coming off its first weekend of competition, the Harvard sailing team was eager to get back out on the water and improve on its first week’s performance. But despite its intentions, the Crimson once again finished mid-pack at its four regattas this weekend.“We were a little disappointed with our results as a team this weekend,” captain Liz Powers said. “We will look to rebound our next time out on the water.”The women’s squad once again brought home the best result, placing seventh at the Mrs. Hurst Bowl at Dartmouth College.Meanwhile, the Harvard co-ed lineup found a bit more trouble in its efforts at the Nevins Trophy regatta at the US Merchant Marine Academy and the Hatch Brown Trophy regatta hosted by MIT and Boston University, finishing 12th and 18th, respectively.A small Crimson co-ed contingent also competed at the Central Series Two regatta hosted by Boston College and UMASS Boston, finishing 14th as a team.MRS. HURST BOWLThe women’s team found some unusual difficulty in the waters of Hanover, N.H. over the weekend. Having won the event two out of the past three years, the squad placed seventh out of a field of 17 teams at the Mrs. Hurst Bowl.The B-division duo of skipper Powers and sophomore crew Marie Appel led Harvard’s efforts on Mascoma Lake. The pair placed second overall in its division’s 10 races, finishing in the top three in four of those 10 contests.“There was a strong but shifty breeze out on the lake this weekend,” Powers said. “Marie and I were able to adapt to the conditions and will only get better as we continue to get used to sailing together.”While the A-division pair of sophomore skipper Emily Lambert and second-year crew Alex Jumper managed the Crimson’s lone race victory, the duo placed 11th overall in its division. Lambert and Jumper placed in the top three in three of their 10 races, including the aforementioned victory in the eighth race of the weekend, but finished in the bottom half of the field in their other seven contests.NEVINS TROPHYHarvard’s top co-ed sailors made their way to Kings Point, N.Y. over the weekend, where the group placed 12th as a team in a field of 20 at the Nevins Trophy regatta.Three divisions of racing were contested at the two-day affair, and the B-division pair of junior skipper Tedd Himler and senior crew Michelle Konstadt faired the best, finishing seventh with top-10 finishes in all 13 of its races.“We were really trying to work on two things this weekend—our starting and our consistency,” Himler said. “We were able to start well and parlay that into some good finishes, and our consistency was great this weekend with all of our top ten finishes.”The A-division pair of skipper and junior captain Alan Palmer and fellow third-year crew Grace Charles were victorious in the sixth race of the weekend, but the duo only managed an 11th-place effort overall in its division.A C-division of racing was also contested in the New York waters over the weekend.  Filling the single-handed role requisite of sailing lasers in this division of racing, rookie Jason Michas placed 15th, managing one finish in the top half of the field over the two days of competition.“I think Jason learned a lot this weekend, competing in his first intersectional collegiate regatta,” Himler said. “He is also a member of the squash team and has really committed himself to being able to excel at both sports.”HATCH BROWN TROPHYWhile the co-ed squad’s more experienced sailors made their way south and found rather mediocre success, the team’s younger and less experienced members did not have to travel far to find similar results.Competing at the Hatch Brown Trophy regatta on the waters of the Charles, the young group of co-ed sailors placed 18th out of a field of 18 teams.The A-division duo of sophomore skipper Brendan Kopp and sophomore crew William White placed 13th overall in their 18 races on the weekend.  The B-division pair—consisting of junior Colin Santangelo at skipper and freshman Sarah McCuskee at crew—did not have as strong a day, as it finished last in its division of racing, despite a runner-up finish in the 12th race of the two-day competition.Freshman Ryan Byrne competed in the C-division for the Crimson, matching his B-division counterparts efforts with an 18th place finish.CENTRAL SERIES TWOA co-ed contingent of Crimson sailors also competed at the Central Series Two regatta hosted by Boston College and UMASS Boston over the weekend.  This group also found limited success, placing 14th out of 15 teams at the event.—Staff writer Thomas D. Hutchison can be reached at tdhutch@fas.harvard.edu.

Flybyblog and blockmates (hereby known as The Entourage) were sitting in Adams D-Hall the other night when we had a near celebrity run-in. No, Ben Affleck did not trump house-only dining—it was none other than campus pseudo-celeb DJ Straus.
“Wait, you’re DJ Straus? We’ve like heard of you!”
After being recruited to “Club at the Pub Weekends”--bimonthly at the Queens Head from 10-2am, featuring DJ Straus--Flyby decided to give DJ Straus’ September mix a little test run. Since Flyby makes no claim to authority on all (any) things hip, we enlisted the help of The Entourage.
DJ Straus’ September Mix:
Track Time: 10 minutes 50 seconds
Playlist:
1. "Daft Punk v. UPenn Girls (Electric Remix)" - Hoodie Allen
2. "Voltage" - Playboy Tre & Mickey Factz (prod by B.o.B)
3. "Great DJ (Calvin Harris Remix)" - The Ting Tings
4. "Extraball (Duotone Remix)" - Yuksek ft. Amanda Blank
5. "No One Sleeps When I'm Awake (La Dolce Vita Remix)" - The Sounds
6. "Let the bodies hit thunder (DJ HLM MORE BASS EDIT) - Crookers vs DJ SEGA
The Entourage thought the mix began a little slow but picked up around the minute mark. Overall The Entourage (a tough crowd, mind you) thought the mix was a little repetitive and needed “more mash.”
“It’s like mashed potatoes that have clumps,” Flybyblog’s roommate said.
Track 2, “Voltage” got high marks in the mix, while The Entourage wasn’t feeling track 6. But the September Mix scored points for being, as DJ Straus says on his website, “genre-infused” and original.
Don’t take our word for it though, (after all, Flyby cranked up Whitney Houston and started a karaoke party after this) check out the September Mix yourself here.

Attention Helicopter Parents:
Harvard hasn't made it possible for you to do your child's laundry or ensure that they are in bed by 9:30 every night, but the University can now soothe your every worry about the biggest crisis to hit Harvard since we ran out of money - swine flu.
Last Friday, September 18, the College opened a new hotline for students, faculty, staff, and, you guessed it, parents to call with any questions they have about the H1N1 influenza. Call 877-366-6606 for a good time...or at least some information about whether your fever means you should skip Ec 10 today.
FlyBy thought we'd give the number a try. Find out what happened after the jump.
FlyBy noticed that the Harvard Hotline is a toll free number, not one of the 617-495-xxxx numbers typical of Harvard, so we were interested to see who would pick up our call.
An automated male voice directed us to check out harvard.edu/h1n1 for information about the University's swine flu policies. If that didn't help, we were given five choices to pick from based on if we are:
1. Feeling ill or calling on behalf of an ill person
2. Students or PARENTS with questions about academic or residential life
3. A Harvard staff member with questions about workplace policies
4. A member of the news media (hmm...seems like they're on to FlyBy)
5. If we want to leave Harvard a message. They'll call us back.
After the swine flu epidemic dissipates, the University plans to turn the phone number into a hotline for other "major issues of interest to the Harvard community," as the website says.
Don't tell FlyBy's mom.  She really likes to talk on the phone.

A lack of coordination between two Harvard Square fast-food stalwarts has made tonight a prodigious opportunity to get your fill of free food. With a copy of their respective newsletters, b.good is offering a free hamburger and Upper Crust is giving away a free slice.
FlyBy feels obligated to inform you of these happenings but would feel slightly unethical providing you with the newsletter. So hit up your houselists ASAP for some free grub.
The b.good coupon will get you a "Cousin Oliver," their standard-fare hamburger. As for Upper Crust, the coupon is good for any of their selection of slices--pepperoni, cheese, or the slice of the day.
In case you're curious, Upper Crust's slice of the day is "Chourizo, banana peppers, and carmalized onions."
Compare that to tonight's HUDS offering of General Gao's Chicken, Shrimp Pad Thai, and Mediterranean "Chicpea" [sic] Stew.
