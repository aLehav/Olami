After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As an alumnus of Harvard College and Harvard Law School who has spent a professional lifetime advocating for my clients, I was shocked to read about the contretemps involving Winthrop House Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. It is highly disturbing that a distinguished Harvard faculty member and lawyer has been excoriated for serving as a member of Harvey Weinstein's defense counsel, and that his attackers are pressuring the University to remove him from his position as faculty dean. Those actions reveal a profound ignorance about what defense lawyers do, how our criminal justice system works, and what the U.S. Constitution demands.
Criminal defense lawyers do not participate in or condone the alleged crimes of their clients. Their advocacy should not — indeed, must not – be deemed as constituting tolerance for such conduct or lack of sympathy for the victims thereof. On the contrary, the American Bar Association’s Rules of Professional Conduct expressly state: "A lawyer's representation of a client does not constitute an endorsement of the client's political, economic, social or moral views or activities."
Was Sullivan required to take on the defense of Weinstein? Not necessarily, but neither did he have unfettered discretion to reject the representation of Weinstein or any other scoundrel because he is hated, because his alleged deeds are loathsome, or because the public/mob (usurping the role which is constitutionally assigned to judge and jury) has decided he "must be guilty." In New York state, our profession's ethical protocol "requires acceptance by a lawyer of [his/her] fair share of tendered employment which may be unattractive both to [the lawyer] and the bar generally."
Inevitably, therefore, a criminal defense lawyer will be obligated to represent many who are alleged (sometimes falsely, sometimes not) to have committed horrific acts. And yes, at some point, that might include someone accused of sexual assault. How could it be otherwise?
The lawyer who is appointed by the court to defend an accused has even less choice. Such an appointment, the ethical standards of New York state tell us, may not be declined except for “compelling reasons.” What if the representation is "personally repugnant" to the lawyer? Does that constitute a "compelling reason" to decline the matter? Not necessarily. "Compelling reasons," New York state rules instruct, “do not include the repugnance of the subject matter, the repugnance of the person or your belief that the client in a criminal matter is guilty.” Under the rules, a lawyer can decline based on personal repugnance only if "the client or the cause is so repugnant to the lawyer as to be likely to impair the client-lawyer relationship or the lawyer's ability to represent the client."
What does this teach us? Something very important. The objective of the rules is to make sure that the lawyer's representation of the criminally accused client is not impaired. The whole point of this structure, the fundamental purpose of our entire criminal justice system and the rules governing lawyer conduct is not to protect the tender sensibilities of student onlookers or Crimson pundits, and certainly not to safeguard lawyers from public scorn. The purpose is to protect the rights of the accused, to make sure the defendant gets a fair trial. That is what our founders cared about; that is what is enshrined in our constitution; and that is the purpose that Sullivan is serving.
In doing so, he is following in a noble tradition. To cite a famous example: More than 240 years ago, John Adams defended the British soldiers who fired on American patriots at the Boston Massacre. They were also reviled, just like Harvey Weinstein, and Adams was condemned by many for representing them. But Adams (who won the case, otherwise I wouldn't tell you this anecdote) called that piece of lawyering "one of the best pieces of service I ever rendered my country."
How sad to see the contrary view being expressed in a supposedly more enlightened era by a supposedly educated elite just a few miles from the Massacre site. Was John Adams not fit to be a Harvard faculty dean?
Once a lawyer takes on the representation of such a client — however abhorrent — the lawyer's duty, by ethical imperative and the American constitutional mandate guaranteeing defendants a fair trial, is to provide the best honest defense available, even if, under the circumstances of the particular case, that amounts to no more than cross-examining the prosecution's witnesses, pleading for mercy, or trying to avoid a death penalty sentence. That is also something that most people don't understand, but surely Harvard students should.
Our system of law depends on lawyers defending the accused with skill, integrity, dedication and independence, and of their refusal to cater to the mob. Defendants who are convicted without such representation have a good chance of reversing their convictions on appeal (represented by another lawyer doing his or her duty).
If righteous indignation compels us to pillory Sullivan and hound him out of his position because of Weinstein's alleged crimes, doesn't the same sanctimonious attitude require us to inflict the identical treatment on anyone else who takes on Weinstein's defense? Why don't we just force Weinstein to go to trial without counsel? In fact, why have a trial at all? Why not just send him to prison? Why not adopt the approach of Lewis Carroll's Red Queen (if I may paraphrase): "Punishment first; verdict afterwards; trial after that."
To equate the lawyer with the purported wrongdoing of the client is an act of foolishness. To demonize the lawyer, attempt to strip him/her of an honored position and attempt to cow the lawyer into dropping the representation is an act of malice that threatens our institutions.
Somewhere, the ghost of John Adams weeps.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, the University announced new changes to this year’s edition of Yardfest, the annual spring concert in Tercentenary Theater. These alterations come as a response to the serious problems associated with last year’s event, when a black student was the victim of alleged police brutality and over 17 students were hospitalized for intoxication.
Harvard’s changes to Yardfest this year are incredibly disappointing on many levels. We fear aspects of the new policy — no guests, no re-entry, and changes to the time and day — will hinder student enjoyment of the event. While we understand the need to curb excessive student intoxication, policies like these may exacerbate the problem.
Though the lessened pressure on first-responders on Sunday informs the move to Sunday, having Yardfest so close to Monday morning classes might reflect poorly on attendance.
Moreover, the new no-guest policy hampers a unique opportunity to foster relationships through this shared experience with individuals outside of the University.
The no re-entry policy, however, is especially concerning. Yardfest is seen as the premier College-wide social event of the spring, analogous to Harvard-Yale in the fall; accordingly, substance use and abuse exist at these events. The social centrality of Yardfest only heightens this truth, even in the face of such changes. The University’s failure to recognize this may lead to students finding themselves in a dangerous position outside of the event.
Under the old policy, students could exit and re-enter the Yard during the event, allowing for consumption of alcohol and other substances at will. With this new change, we are concerned students might indulge in binge-drinking for the effects to last the length of the event. This would run directly contrary to the University’s express desires and pose serious risks to student health and safety.
While all of these policies are cause for concern, they are overshadowed by the forcible arrest of a black undergraduate last year that sparked allegations of police brutality. Though we have previously lauded the University’s November report on the incident, we believe Harvard has still not taken sufficient action to address past wrongs or prevent similar incidents in the future.
In the review committee’s report, one improvement called for the clarification of the respective roles of Harvard University Health Services and the Harvard University Police Department. In a March email announcing new policies regarding this year’s Yardfest, the College referenced neither HUHS nor HUPD — and it did not clarify the respective roles of either body should an emergency arise. If these changes have been made, the College should publicize them. If no changes have not, Harvard should work to determine the roles of each organization for the safety of all its community members.
It is absolutely appropriate for the University to try to improve Yardfest both for safety and for student enjoyment. But we fear that the changes enacted for this year will do neither. Even so, it is unfortunate that any change in student behavior could be attributed solely to the changes the University made to Yardfest and not to students learning from last year, an outlier in student intoxication.
College spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman has stated that these changes are not set in stone for future Yardfests and that it “will be evaluating all aspects of the event to help in our planning for future years.” The administration must stand by this promise to seriously and rigorously evaluate the efficacy of the changes that they have made.
The spectre of last year will loom large at Yardfest 2019. Overall, we hope students stay safe and enjoy the music.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Survivor’s guilt is a phenomenon that has often been tied to people who’ve survived traumatic events like natural disaster and war. In the past years there’s been more research on how a form of survivor’s guilt affects first-generation college students as they come to find they have more opportunities available than their families and communities back home.
My original idea for this article was to have it be in two pieces. One was meant to address the struggle with mental health of feeling like your life is just about survival, like you’re constantly falling and getting yourself back up. I wanted to follow this with an article on survivor’s guilt when survival feels like a huge accomplishment at school, knowing people are struggling back home with less access to resources. I decided, instead, to combine them, as I’ve noticed how survivor’s guilt has kept me solely in survival mode.
***
“How was your spring break?” People asked over the past week hoping it would be a positive conversation starter, or a good memory to think about now that we were back to the stress of the grind at Harvard.
I often replied with a nervous laugh or “It was okay” if I didn’t want them to follow up with more questions.
“I was just at home.” To some I would add, “There were just family problems and financial stressors that lined up perfectly with my time there.” Keeping it intentionally vague.
***
I’m back home lying in bed with my mom. Being at home brings everything rushing back. It gets me caught up on all that I have missed — all that you can’t truly understand over the phone. Taking out my stress on my mom, I tell her I want to leave halfway through. I feel guilty afterwards. Even more so later knowing she didn’t have the same option. These were her main stressors at home. I was now a visitor in them. I’m just a visitor at home now. I’ve “made it out.” I’m one of the lucky ones, though we often forget when we’re drowning in work at school.
***
Mental health fluctuates here. Friends sometimes notice that you’re not yourself. Sometimes they stop noticing because you get better at pretending you’re okay. But you notice. Therapy appointments increase. Depression naps increase. And you’re too scared to call home. You don’t tell anyone. Because at the end of the day, at least you made it. Your family has their own problems. You don’t want to burden them with yours. Your friends have their own problems. You hold it all in, scared of when it’s all gonna spill over. Tears approaching your eyelids in this silent library. Biting your lip to keep them at bay. You’ve gotten good at this. You’ve gotten good at surviving.
***
I struggle with my self-care, as I keep my struggles silenced: I’m used to minimizing them, since it always feels like there’s somebody who has it worse. That’s the mentality I grew up with.
“Al menos no estamos como ellos. Si ves que hay gente que sí sufre.” My mom talked over the news that was covering the latest tragedy. She reminded us to be grateful that our lives weren’t that bad. I have often rejected this sentiment, feeling that it was invalidating. One person’s suffering shouldn’t erase someone else’s. I realize now it was really a coping mechanism. I try not to take this from my mom, knowing she doesn’t have the same access to mental health support that I do now.
***
“Oh, I was definitely depressed before I got to Harvard,” my coworker joked when we were on the same topic around spring break and going home.
“Same. I just wasn’t diagnosed because I didn’t have health insurance,” I joked back.
I remember the many times I’ve anxiously awaited my next therapy appointment. I’ve gauged how well I’m doing by how much I’ve felt like I was holding it all in until I had the permission to release the tension with someone who was getting paid to listen to me — somebody who, I felt, I wouldn’t burden with my problems.
My therapist wonders if I’ve felt a sense of responsibility over my parents — something many children of immigrants feel as we grow up translating and filling out paperwork. She wonders if I feel there is a connection between that and all the emotional labor I’ve taken on in other relationships. How this may affect the tendency for me to put others’ needs before my own.
Part of my survivor’s guilt is being wary to not make my parents feel like I am ashamed of them. I struggle to confirm that I have felt a sense of role reversal with my parents because I don’t want to infantilize them.
***
“You are a force of nature.” I whisper to myself as I look in the mirror after getting up and wiping my tears from my latest panic attack, ready to continue with my day.
But this force of nature gets tired. And as much as we want to say there’s beauty in how we get up and thank our families for teaching us to be strong like them, I wonder what it’d be like to not constantly be trying to survive. I’m working on not feeling guilty for wanting more than that.

Roberta A. Kaplan ’88 will speak at Harvard Law School’s Class Day on May 29, the school announced Thursday.
Kaplan, who graduated from the College with a degree in History and Literature, is known for successfully representing Edith Windsor in the Supreme Court case United States v. Windsor in 2013. The case deemed Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as only between man and woman, unconstitutional. Same-sex marriage was ultimately legalized two years later.
Kaplan wrote in an email that it is “an enormous honor” to speak at Class Day.
“It’s obviously an enormous honor. And I have to admit that it’s also more than a little surreal,” Kaplan wrote.
Kaplan earned her J.D. from Columbia in 1991, where she currently teaches a seminar on Advanced Civil Procedure. She is also a founding partner at law firm Kaplan, Hecker & Fink, which specializes in “fusing high-stakes litigation with a groundbreaking public interest practice,” according to its website.
Kaplan is the author of the book, "Then Comes Marriage," which tells the story of the case and its ruling. The Los Angeles Times picked it as one of the best books of 2015.
She also co-founded the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, according to the school’s announcement. A division of the National Women’s Law Center, the fund helps “connect women who experience workplace sexual harassment and retaliation with attorneys and, in some cases, media specialists,” according to NWLC’s website.
Kaplan has received honors and awards for her legal work, such as the “Most Innovative Lawyer of The Year” award given by The Financial Times.
Kaplan wrote she hopes to highlight the importance of democracy and upholding legal principles during her address.
“We live at a time when enforcing the law is arguably more important than ever before in our nation’s history. And that, of course, requires lawyers to bring cases, defend rights, and stand up for fundamental norms and principles of our constitutional democracy,” she wrote. “I hope to convince the graduating 3Ls that we need each and every one of them to be part of this critical endeavor. And that they can and should commit to doing this regardless of whether they go to work for a not-for-profit, the government, or a private law firm.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After months of impassioned protest and community meetings, Harvard Divinity School’s storied oak tree near Andover-Harvard Theological Library was felled Friday morning.
The Divinity School announced the tree’s impending removal in September as part of planned renovations to Andover Hall. In the ensuing months, students concerned with the tree’s sanctity and environmental value negotiated back and forth with administrators to try and save the oak.
After Harvard’s arborist declared the tree’s health “significantly compromised” in the fall, students continued protesting the tree’s removal in the hopes it could be saved. The school hired outside company Bartlett Tree experts to assess the tree, and in February the tree management company concluded the oak was at “high risk” of failure. The city of Cambridge’s arborist also agreed the tree should be taken down.
Later that month, the Divinity School published a statement on its website that “there is no choice but to remove the tree.”
In early March, administrators emailed students to say the tree would be removed over spring break. The date was then pushed back after students demanded more time to plan a mourning ritual.
“We protested that and the administration said we could have an extra week,” said Mary K. Balkon, a Divinity School student who helped organize the ritual.
The ceremony was held Wednesday evening and lasted about two hours, with dozens in attendance.
“It was a really moving ritual and people stayed for two hours in the cold,” Divinity School student Gretchen T. Legler said.
The gathering began with Divinity School community members sharing stories about the tree’s importance. There were poetry recitations, singing, and a reading of “The Giving Tree” by Shel Silverstein. Legler passed out cookies baked with flour made from the tree’s acorns.
“In the fall I collected acorns and processed them into acorn flour, so I made these acorn cookies that I gave out at the ritual as a sort of acorn communion,” Legler said. “My message was that the oak tree nourishes our spirits, but in the form of this wafer it also nourishes our bodies.”
A number of Divinity School faculty spoke at the ritual, including Professor of Buddhist Studies Janet Gyatso. In her remarks, she praised and apologized to the tree.
“I admired and praised the oak tree’s exceptional beauty, expressed deep thanks to the tree for its many years of wonderful shade that it provided to the Divinity School community, and apologized sorrowfully to it for the fact that it was being taken down,” Gyatso wrote in an email.
Attendees then formed a circle around the tree to bless it.
“Almost every religion has some kind of sacred tree or trees that serve sacred functions in its stories,” Balkon said. “So we asked people from different religions to remember those trees and ask for blessings for this tree in memory of those trees.”
On Friday, a smaller group of students gathered to witness the tree being cut down. The night before, someone had spray painted on the tree, “Be careful of the squirrels,” and “Goodbye humans, good luck, you’ll need it,” according to multiple students.
Some students who watched the tree be cut down, including Balkon, said the inside of the felled oak appeared healthy to them, but a number of arborists who have previously examined the tree have said otherwise.
During the removal, pieces of the tree, such as parts of branches or wood chips, were made available to community members to take with them. Acorns from the tree were also saved to germinate and be grown later on, according to Michael P. Naughton, a Divinity School spokesperson.
Parts of the tree are being stored while students and administrators discuss whether and how to reuse the wood. Though some students want the wood incorporated into a new structure, others believe reusing the tree would be disrespectful, Balkon said.
“I think one of the things that emerged as most important in that conversation was that people very much wanted this tree remembered,” Balkon said.
Correction: April 6, 2019
A previous version of this article misspelled Mary Balkon's name.

Kennedy School Professor and former Obama economic advisor Jason Furman ’92 and Economics Professor David I. Laibson ’88 will take over teaching Economics 10: “Principles of Economics” next fall.
The two professors will replace Economics Professor N. Gregory Mankiw as course heads of Ec10, the department’s year-long flagship introductory course and one of Harvard’s largest undergraduate courses. Mankiw announced in early March that he will step down from teaching the course at the end of the semester to pursue “new pedagogical challenges.”
The two said they plan to change the course structure from its current format to make lectures “far more frequent.” Instead of attending three sections per week with approximately 20 of those sections replaced by a lecture, students will attend two lectures and one section per week.
Furman said the change will provide him and Laibson more instruction time, which they said they hope to use to incorporate more real-world applications into the material they cover.
“We want to get across sort of standard textbook analytical economics, but also be able to spend time on how that gets applied to issues like inequality or tax policy, or the latest policies that the Fed[eral Reserve] is doing, and think that's better if we're spending more time in lecture,” Furman said.
Laibson added that the two hope to attract students across disciplines to the course by increasing its “breadth of topics.”
“It's not an abstract exercise and a starting point for becoming an economist,” Laibson said. “It's rather an introduction to foundational ideas that can be applied everywhere in their lives, whatever they do, certainly if they become an economist, but also on any other paths they choose.”
“Economics is not just about finance and consulting — it's about inequality; it's about discrimination; it's about issues in gender,” he added.
The course will likely move out of its current location — the historic Sanders Theatre — and into a lecture hall in the Science Center, where the teaching staff will record the lectures and post them online, according to Furman.
“We think that will create a little bit of a better ability to interact with the course, and to be in a room that isn't quite as beautiful but I think quite large and easy to get lost in as well,” Furman said.
Both professors cited Mankiw as a formative influence upon their academic careers and said they plan on drawing heavily from his material. Economics Department Chair Jeremy C. Stein praised Mankiw’s leadership of the course in an email, estimating he taught around 10,000 students during his tenure as Ec10 course head.
“Many of our future leaders — in the private sector, in academia, in public service, and the arts — all got their first exposure to the power of economic reasoning from not only one of the world’s foremost academic economists, but also from someone with very substantial senior policymaking experience,” Stein wrote.
“It is our great good fortune that we are able to continue this tradition with Jason Furman and David Laibson having agreed to take over the course starting next fall,” he added.

Carlos M. Brown Jr., a senior at Henrico High School in Richmond, Va., spent Thursday night volunteering at a local elementary school and trying to keep his emotions in check.
“I think that helped calm the nerves I told everyone I didn’t have,” Brown said of the event.
When it ended, he headed outside with his friends to check his Harvard admission portal, expecting to get a rejection.
“When I read ‘Congratulations,’ I took off running across the parking lot,” Brown said. “It honestly took me 40 minutes to calm down enough to drive home.”
Brown was one of the 1,015 applicants who received word of their admission to Harvard Thursday, joining 935 applicants who were accepted via early action in December. The Class of 2023 had a record-low acceptance rate of 4.5 percent, with just 1,950 of the 43,330 applicants receiving invitations to attend the College.
Other applicants also looked for ways to remain calm before decisions were released at 7 p.m. EST.
Remka Y. Nwana, a senior from W.T. Woodson High School in Fairfax, Va,, said she played Beyonce on repeat for half an hour. Shraddha Joshi, a senior at the Meridian World School in Round Rock, Texas, also turned to music in the moments before the decisions were released, opting for her favorite Arabic music.
Katherine Y. Zhu, a senior from San Diego, Calif., tried napping to stave off her stress. She applied as part of the early action pool, but was deferred. More than 5,000 of the near 7,000 early action applicants were deferred.
“When I saw that deferral, Harvard had been my dream for so long, and it was quite disappointing,” she said. She poured hours into a letter of continued interest that she sent to admissions officers, and then “just waited.”
“I was just about to fall asleep when I jerked awake and realized, oh my gosh, it’s 4:05. Decisions are out,” Zhu said. “I was crouching down because I was just in shock, because someone that had been deferred from the early round was finally able to get in.”
Many applicants said they made a point to be with their families when they checked their admissions portals.
“For my family, it was always very important to us that we had the whole family together,” Isaiah J. Kim, a senior from Wallingford, Penn., said. “Whether you know things went well or not we’d be there to support each other.”
Kim said he was “definitely happy” when he received the news, but he was also “a little concerned” about his mom.
“She was bawling her eyes out,” he said. “I think she was just kind of overcome with emotion.”
Joshi said her younger brother could not wait to share the news with the whole neighborhood.
“My younger brother opened up the window and started screaming, ‘My sister got into Harvard!’ she said.
Several admitted students also shared feelings of shock and disbelief at their acceptances, believing that they were about to receive rejection letters.
“I didn’t scream right away. I was thinking to myself, ‘No, this has to be an actual joke,’” Nawana said. “I wanted to keep reading to make sure that I actually got it.”
Lawrence T. Jia, a senior from Maggie L. Walker High School in Richmond, Va., said he too was in disbelief.
“I never would have imagined getting into Harvard. It has always been a dream and a goal of mine, but now that it was all happening, I felt really humbled and calm,” he said. “All I could say for the next few moments was wow. Capital W-O-W, WOW.”
Accepted students have the opportunity to visit Harvard during its admitted students weekend — dubbed Visitas — from April 27 to 29.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council voted to allocate the Palestine Solidarity Committee $2,050 to host Israeli Apartheid Week at Sunday’s general meeting.
IAW is an international movement across college campuses to raise awareness of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians. The PSC planned much of the programming of Harvard’s event, which began on March 30 and runs until April 4. The week includes Palestinian speakers, a student panel, an unveiling of a physical Wall of Resistance, and a movie screening.
The bill to fund IAW passed 21-13-4 and drew money from the UC's Grant for an Open Harvard College, which subsidizes student initiatives that address one of the UC’s indicated “compelling interests.” The interests for the 2018-19 academic year are “mental health, race, culture, and faith relations, sexual assault and harassment prevention, social spaces, and financial accessibility.”
The council financed the event with the special grant because it does not typically give funds of more than $2,000 through its normal grant process, according to Finance Committee Chair Noah Harris ’22. Harris also stated that the event, which addressed the “race relations” interest, does not actually have to improve race relations; it is sufficient for the event to relate to them.
PSC Treasurer Katie M. Farkouh ’21 said the organization needed the UC to help finance the event because it lacks sufficient funds of its own. PSC Co-President Christian B. Tabash ’21 said in an interview after the meeting that the group, which is entirely student-run, is “certainly happy” that the UC decided to pass the resolution to grant funding for IAW.
“We have no outside funding, and our main purpose is to uplift the voice of the voiceless,” Tabash said.
Dozens of students who supported and opposed the Council’s funding of the event attended Sunday’s meeting. Students disagreed as to whether the event allowed for open dialogue among students with opposing views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
“One of the main focuses of Israeli Apartheid Week, featured both on their wall and with their speakers, including the founder of the movement is the BDS [boycott, divest, sanction] movement,” Ariel R. Hecker ’21 said.
Multiple Jewish students said the event makes them feel uncomfortable because some of the speakers invited to the week’s events have previously endorsed violence against Israeli civilians.
“One of the speakers that is slated to come, Omar Barghouti, has said that he supports the euthanasia of Zionism,” Gabriel Dardik ’21 said. “Really, it makes me feel unsafe that this kind of person could come here.”
PSC supporters said Harvard Hillel has also brought speakers to campus who contributed to military operations against Palestinian civilians.
“We can’t have a conversation about this if we are consistently obfuscating the facts of the situation, which is also, by the way, that Hillel has consistently hosted members of the Israeli military who have led operations that kill Palestinian civilians,” Anwar Omeish ’19 said.
UC representatives said they support freedom of speech but do not want to provide a platform for speakers who support violence.
“I don’t think that the UC should start to approve or not approve different speakers based on their views, but I do think that that line is the incitement of violence,” Currier Representative Michael A. Shadpour ’20 said. “I’ve heard uncontested that there are speakers [at IAW] that have advocated violence in the past.”
Harris clarified that UC funds do not support speakers. Though PSC applied for speaker honorarium, accomodations, and travel assistance, event funding was not allocated for those purposes. Instead, the UC funded the venue, food, and decorations.
Many council members said they recognize some of their constituents would be offended no matter how they vote. They said they decided to fund the event because it met the requirements of the UC’s Finance Committee, and funding a student event is not necessarily a sign of endorsement.
“I think it’s important in our vote that we completely divest our personal opinions and vote just based on policy,” Pforzheimer Representative C. Scott Courvoisier ’20 said. “It seems to me that these people have met our requirements for getting the grant, and therefore, I think we should fund it.”
UC Treasurer Jack M. Swanson ’22 clarified to the Council after the vote had taken place that none of the allocated funds will be distributed before IAW occurs because the College has not yet provided the UC with its funds for the semester.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Black Law Students Association released a statement Sunday supporting Faculty Dean and Harvard Law School professor Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr.’s decision to represent Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and criticizing College administrators’ decision to launch a climate review in Winthrop House.
The statement alleged the College’s response to student outcry over Sullivan’s decision had “racist undertones” and contested arguments that attorneys should not represent people accused of sexual assault and rape. BLSA also affirmed its support for survivors of sexual violence and praised Sullivan’s previous work as a defense attorney.
“Professor Sullivan has been HBLSA’s faculty advisor for many years,” the members wrote. “Because of this, HBLSA finds it important that we speak to the controversy and make the ask of Harvard University to both unequivocally support survivors of sexual violence and to do so in a way that does not scapegoat Professor Sullivan for the University’s failings to address sexual violence on campus.”
Sullivan has faced scrutiny since he announced he would represent Weinstein on Jan. 23. In open letters, protests, and editorials, some students wrote that they believe Sullivan’s representation of Weinstein creates a negative environment for Winthrop students who have experienced sexual violence. Some of those students have called on him to step down from his post as faculty dean.
In the days after his announcement, Sullivan sent two emails to Winthrop residents. In the first, he cited defense lawyers’ duty to represent “unpopular” defendants. In the second, he and co-faculty dean Stephanie R. Robinson laid out a set of “processes,” including designating Resident Dean Linda D.M. Chavers as the “point person” for issues related to sexual misconduct.
BLSA wrote in their statement that they defer discussions of Sullivan’s role as a faculty dean to undergraduates because they are “not equipped” as law students to weigh in on a College-specific position.
“If the students who have this unique relationship have raised concerns, either as students in Winthrop House or as members of the broader Harvard College community, their critique deserves to be heard on its own terms and in light of their unique relationship as a student of Harvard College engaging with a Faculty Dean rather than the implications of that relationship being ignored or dismissed wholesale,” the members wrote.
In response to undergraduates’ concerns, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana launched a climate review in an email to Winthrop residents Feb. 25. The ongoing review, led by former Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, allows House affiliates two options to share their thoughts on Winthrop’s climate — meeting with Dingman or his colleague Jennifer Bergeron and filling out a survey distributed March 6. Khurana wrote in February that the College will take “actions, as appropriate” in response to the review’s results.
The BLSA statement sharply criticized the climate review. It pointed to comments Sullivan made to the New York Times in March — Sullivan said then that the Winthrop climate review was without precedent and he pointed out that he is the first African-American to hold the position of faculty dean.
“We are also concerned of the racist undertones evidenced by the disproportionate response to this issue by the University,” the law students wrote. “It is not lost on us that Professor Sullivan was the first African American appointed to the position of Faculty Dean in Harvard’s history. Taking his statements as true, he is also the first Faculty Dean to receive such outsized treatment in the case of a controversy.”
College administrators last looked into the climate of a residential house in 2015, after students and tutors in Dunster House raised concerns about their faculty deans’ lack of support for BGLTQ students.
The students wrote they believe the College should not “scapegoat” Sullivan in an effort to address issues of sexual misconduct on campus. They cited a 2015 survey of undergraduates that found 31 percent of women in the class of 2015 had experienced unwanted sexual conduct during their time at Harvard.
“Professor Sullivan should not be made a scapegoat for the University's general failing to address pressing and prevalent issues of sexual violence,” the BLSA members wrote.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain pointed to steps the Title IX Office and the Office for Dispute Resolution — the office that investigates formal Title IX complaints — have taken to “strengthen resources and processes” in an email Sunday.
In response to a request for comment, BLSA President Lauren D. Williams referred to the group's statement.
Sullivan did not respond to a request for comment Sunday afternoon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty will debate a proposal to retain shopping week until at least 2022 at its monthly meeting Tuesday, likely setting up a vote before the semester ends.
The proposed legislation would establish a standing committee to review shopping week — the period at the beginning of each semester during which students can sample classes before enrolling — and course registration overall. The committee, which would have until spring 2022 to finish its work, will be tasked with creating algorithms to better predict course enrollment and trying to coordinate class lotteries.
The legislation is the latest in a debate over shopping week that has stretched for years. Faculty and graduate students have criticized the current system for creating job insecurity for teaching fellows, in some instances leading to late paychecks, and for reducing instruction time during the first week of the semester.
The proposal is the culmination of months of work by another committee, led by Philosophy Professor Bernhard Nickel — which determined that the elimination of shopping week, an idea supported by multiple administrators including FAS Dean Claudine Gay, was premature at this point.
“We had lots of conversations with other people in the University, listening sessions, one on one conversations, we had a website where we got about 400 comments through the commenting function,” he said in an interview Monday. “And then we discussed this at length within the committee and outside, to refine our reasoning.”
“Ultimately, what we found was that the issue of shopping period is really a very nuanced and very complex one,” he said.
The Faculty will also consider a proposal to establish a new degree program for Harvard Business School students, called the “Masters of Science in Biotechnology: Life Sciences,” at Tuesday’s meeting.
The degree, which will take two and a half years to complete, will be geared towards students seeking to work in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors. The program will be reviewed after five cohorts have graduated.
Also at Tuesday’s meeting, the faculty will discuss a proposal to overhaul the empirical and mathematical reasoning requirement to the General Education curriculum. The new requirement — called the Quantitative Reasoning with Data requirement — will “ensure that students reach a level of quantitative facility involving mathematical, statistical, and computational methods,” according to the proposal.
The requirement aims to improve students’ ability to “think critically about data,” the proposal states.
Though the Faculty Council — the Faculty of Arts and Science’s highest governing body — approved all three proposals at its meeting last week, its vote is purely advisory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President of Ghana Nana Akufo-Addo spoke at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics Friday, arguing the African continent’s abundant natural resources should be capitalized upon to raise money for investment in Africa’s youth population.
Africa is demographically the youngest continent in the world; 60 percent of its population is under 25 years old. Akufo-Addo referred to the age structure of the African population as a “demographic dividend” that has the potential to translate into growth and prosperity.
“The world, particularly Africa, has the largest generation of young people in history,” Akufo-Addo said. “I place great hope in their capacity to shape the future of Africa, and make Africa the lion it was meant to be.”
During his tenure as president, Akufo-Addo implemented the Free High School Education policy in September 2017, making secondary high school free for students in Ghana. At the IOP, Akufo-Addo highlighted the importance of accessible education in developing human capital. He also urged for the inclusion of youth voices in policy-making.
“We cannot talk about sustainable development without the active involvement of youth,” Akufo-Addo said.
Akufo-Addo advocated for “maximum attention” to job creation across the African continent in a call to action for fellow heads of state. He linked youth unemployment to political unrest, citing the Arab Spring, a series of anti-government uprisings that spread across the Middle East in 2010.
“The so-called Arab Spring showed clearly that lack of employment opportunities can undermine social cohesion and political stability,” Akufo-Addo said.
Ghana was founded in 1957, when the Gold Coast gained independence from the United Kingdom. The country’s independence came with a wave of African decolonization in the 1950s and 1960s. Akufo-Addo said the formidable challenges that linger from colonialism should be remedied by democratic consolidation.
“Postcolonial authoritarian rule failed the African peoples,” Akufo-Addo said. “It continued the impoverishment of our people, which is the consequence of colonialism and imperialism.”
The crowd applauded as Akufo-Addo urged African leaders to reclaim the benefits of the continent’s vast natural resources.
“There are nations who have built their industrial complexes around the value chain of our raw commodities. It is time to change that setup,” he said.
In response to a question about growing Chinese investment in Africa, Akufo-Addo said Ghana’s evolving relationship with China has enabled the country to better profit from its natural resources with new trade relationships.
“We in Ghana have a very strong and constructive engagement with China,” he said. “Today, we are not accepting what ten years ago the arrangements for barter were, which hinged on the pledging of our natural resources.”
Akufo-Addo also shared his hope for “a Ghana without aid” and the independence of the African continent as a whole from foreign aid.
“There is an abundance of dynamic, entrepreneurial talent on our continent struggling to express itself,” Akufo-Addo said. “We have to encourage this expression with full force, and ensure that we can stand on our own feet, and make it impossible for the systematic looting and plundering of our human and material resources that have characterized much of our modern history to continue.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Committee on Student Life voted to approve 21 and deny 19 student organizations for full recognition by the College in a meeting Thursday.
Newly approved student organizations include the Harvard Undergraduate Symphony Society, the Harvard Open Data Project, and PERIOD at Harvard College, according to Undergraduate Council Vice President Julia M. Huesa ’20.
UC President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 said in an interview Saturday that one additional student group was “approved with conditions” by the committee, but Palaniappan did not specify the name of that group.
College recognition confers an array of benefits for student groups, including the ability to apply for grant funding, reserve spaces for events, and recruit on Harvard’s campus — benefits denied to unrecognized groups.
For the 19 groups denied full recognition, the UC cited lack of communication and failure to comply with requirements of the approval process as reasons for which groups did not receive the status.
UC Rules Committee chair Michael Cheng ’22 said the UC only denied groups that did not attend a required interview with the UC Rules Committee or violated criteria on the rubric for student organizations, such as not having a faculty advisor or lacking a “clear plan of succession for leadership.”
Huesa said “almost all” of the denied groups did not communicate with the UC throughout the approval process.
“The majority of the groups that were denied either didn't respond to the email, didn't come to the interview, didn't engage with the process whatsoever,” Huesa said.
In making the recent decisions on full recognition of new student groups, Cheng said the UC received each provisional group’s constitution, meeting agendas, bylaws, and procedures for selecting its student leaders and members. The organizations submitted their applications in February and interviewed with the Rules Committee in early March, according to Cheng.
“The bar for approval was pretty much, fulfill a few key requirements, like we weren’t trying to deny clubs,” Cheng said.
The 41 organizations up for potential recognition this term were among 61 groups that applied for provisional status — a one-year trial period — in fall 2017. This is the first iteration of a new process that allows the UC to weigh in on the provisional and full approval of new clubs. The process originated from the College’s efforts to stem the proliferation of new student organizations in spring 2017.
Correction: April 6, 2019
A previous version of this story misstated Michael Cheng's class year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Activist Emerald Garner — whose father died after being held in a chokehold by police officers in 2014 — spoke about her work surrounding social injustice and police brutality at a event Friday at the Smith Campus Center.
The event, titled “No More Names: A Conversation about Community Activism and Criminal Justice,” featured Garner and former NBA player Etan Thomas in a panel moderated by Reverend Jonathan L. Walton, a professor at the Divinity School. No More Names — a student group focused on inspiring young activism surrounding criminal justice — organized the event in conjunction with the Office of the Arts.
Garner opened the panel by speaking about the loss of her father, Eric Garner, whose death inspired slogans in the Black Lives Matter Movement such as “I can’t breathe.” These slogans appeared in demonstrations and die-ins in Harvard Square and Boston Common following the 2014 incident, which took place in New York City. Emerald Garner said she became an activist in the wake of her father’s death.
“Speaking engagements are what really opened my eyes,” she said. “People really want to know what I have to say.”
Garner said that despite finding the new platform, she experienced challenges in seeing the media coverage of her father’s death, which she said neglected that she was a “real human being.”
“I watch TV shows, and it’s a whole reenactment of what the video was or reenactment of what happened in my life, or what they think is my life. They take what they want to take, not the real. I am a real person,” she said.
Thomas, whose book “We Matter” discusses the intersection of activism and athletics, said he has seen a lack of empathy in treatment of victims of police brutality and their families. Walton also said there is a lack of attention to persistent injustice in today’s society.
“There seems to be this kind of collective attention deficit disorder in our society. We go from one thing to the other,” Walton said. “Somebody else comes along and all the attention moves, and communities are still grieving. Injustice is still burgeoning.”
The event also featured student performances by MJangles, Lincoln Hart, and 21 Colorful Crimson, a musical group comprised of 21 Harvard sophomores.
No More Names co-founder Meshaal Bannerman ’21 said the organization reached out to Garner and Thomas to promote the group’s goal ending the “cycle of criminalization of black bodies and the brutality of black bodies.”
“We’re trying to form a coalition where we can have different campuses and different young activists come together to raise awareness for problems we truly believe haven’t gone away for years,” Bannerman said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Competing in a total of four events over the course of two days, senior nordic skier Hannah Hardenbergh and freshman nordic skier James Kitch wrapped up a successful trip to the NCAA Skiing Championship.
For Hardenbergh, the thought of competing at the highest collegiate level served as motivation throughout the season, as she hoped to cap off her senior year with her a personal-best . Her hard work paid off as she was able to finish the season by qualifying and then competing at the NCAA Skiing Championship.
The 66th Annual National Collegiate Skiing Championship was hosted by the University of Vermont in Stowe, Vt. from Mar. 6 to Mar. 9. 74 men and 74 women, making up some of the best collegiate skiers, were selected to participate in the event. The skiers represent those at the top of their field, so the field was deep and the competition challenging, This didn’t intimidate the Harvard program from adding to that competition.
University of Utah ended up leading the teams in scoring, earning its 13th title in program history with a total of 426.5 points. University of Vermont followed in second place.
The championship includes both nordic and alpine events, with both Hardenbergh and Kitch representing the Crimson in the nordic categories at their first ever NCAA appearance. The Nordic categories Harvard competed in include the men’s 10k freestyle and 20k classical and the women's 5k freestyle and 15k classical.
Hardenbergh opened up the Division 1 Championships on Wednesday, competing in the 5k freestyle. Her first appearance at the tournament went well, with a time of 14:47.4 she placed 35th overall. The 5k is a typically a sprint style race and usually one of Hardenbergh’s stronger races.
Skiers accumulate points over the course of the regular season for their performance. This ranking of skiers is updated throughout the season, and often serves as a goal for athletes throughout the season.
The fierce competition from other schools and many upperclassman makes qualifying challenging, and something that athletes work towards throughout their entire collegiate careers.
“I was not surprised,” Hardenbergh reflected on Kitch’s qualification. “We both have been working hard towards this goal for a long time and it felt really good to finally see all the hours and the energy pay off.”
Kitch was coming off an especially impressive performance for his first season on the team. In his opening competition earlier this winter, Kitch paced the Crimson men’s nordic squad which resulted in him placing 18th at the St. Lawrence Carnival with a time of 30:14.3.
Concluding Harvard’s showing in Stowe was Kitch with his best performance of the championship. Bringing home the Crimson’s sole team points from the championship, Kitch earned Harvard six points with his 25th place in the Men’s 20k Classical with a time of 58:28.1.
Kitch also opened the competition well, finishing the 10k Freestyle Skate in 26.16.0 earning a place of 37th out of a field of 40.
“It couldn’t have gone better,” said Hardenbergh. “Qualifying for championships has been a four year long goal of mine and I was very satisfied to end on a high note.”
The trip to the NCAA by two members of the Harvard Nordic Skiing caps off another impressive season for the Crimson as they continue to build up the team. Although the Crimson will lose Hardenbergh to graduation, Kitch remains a promising figure on a developing program.

With six All-Americans and a fourth place overall team finish, Harvard fencing concluded its season with a strong performance in the NCAA Championships last week.
The women’s team finished the year at 16-6, with a Ivy League record of 3-3, while the men finished at 16-3 with an impressive 5-1 record within the Ivy League.
Entering into the tournament, the Harvard men’s team was ranked No. 2 in the nation, only trailing Colombia, while the women’s team was ranked No. 5. The Crimson had high hopes, each team sending the maximum number of fencers allowed to Cleveland.
The result was the highest finish for Harvard fencing since 2006, a year in which it won the tournament. The fourth place finish was the result of strong individual performances across the board.
For the women, first years Veronica Czyzewski and Elizabeth Tartakovsky took home bronze in the saber. The duo racked up 19 and 17 victories with a +43 and +40 touch differential, respectively. As a result, the pair earned First-Team NCAA honors on their way to a tied-third place finish in the semifinals. Fellow first year Cynthia Liu was recognized as an honorable mention in the foil, going 13-9, with a +4 touch mark, demonstrating the results of a talented and committed freshman class.
“We came in fourth at the NCAA championships with some really strong performances especially from the younger members of the team which bodes well for coming seasons,” junior foil George Haglund said. “They’re freshman and have been training very hard all season.”
On the men’s side, Geoffrey Tourette worked his way to a 17-6 record in the foil round robins with a +42 touch differential before advancing to the semi-finals. There he earned a bronze medal in the event, marking the first of two top 10 finishes for the men. For his performance, Tourette garnered First-Team NCAA honors. Fellow foil fencer and junior co-captain Duncan Rheingans-Yoo placed 18th in the event.
Freshman sabre fencer Daniel Solomon put together 12 wins and placed 12th in the event, which earned him an honorable mention for his performance. Junior epee fencer Erwin Cai racked up 14 wins on the way to a 7th place finish in the event. This finish marked the second NCAA recognition for the Crimson men as Solomon garnered Second-Team NCAA. Fencing the epee for Harvard, sophomore Adrien Thein-Sandler racked up 12 victories to finish 14th and senior Albert Chien put up 10 wins.
Overall, the Crimson put together a strong finish to the season with some strong individual and team performances to put together their best finish since 2006. Spirits are high and the team will look to build on its success next season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the women of Harvard’s softball team, home ain’t hard to find. And for those who choose to make long-distance, persistence-requiring trek across the Charles to Soldiers Field, the team’s home green is certainly an easy place to locate as well – for spectators, the walk to the ballpark is more of a walk in the park.
The first thing that will draw any cheerer-of-the-Crimson to the squad’s home turf is the noise level. Sandwiched smack in between O’Donnell Field – home to Harvard’s baseball team – and the unnamed, unkempt remnants of a long-abandoned Little League diamond – home to a much older, albeit much more enthusiastic, men’s softball team – any reputable acoustician would sentence Soldiers Field to a lifetime of comparative soundlessness. However, this was not the case in this weekend’s games against Brown.
Fans of the ladies in Crimson are not ones to be silenced, shouting, at the top of their lungs, everything from “Show ‘em the money, Harvard!” to “Rhode Island isn’t even a real state!” (in response to that last putdown, one particularly-spirited dad from the Ocean State hollered, “Smallest state, biggest wins!” and proceeded to scout the bleachers for chuckles. Nobody laughed). For the Crimson, this home field enthusiasm may have been just what the team needed.
“We worked really hard this week to really bounce back from a tough opening weekend last weekend, so it’s always refreshing to be on our field and protect our house,” said Harvard captain Kaitlyn Schiffhauer. “We take a lot of pride in both the work we’ve done this week and wearing the Harvard name across our chest every weekend.”
Last weekend was certainly a tough one for Harvard (10-12, 4-2 Ivy). Though the team trounced Penn in their first match against the Quakers last Saturday, the Crimson fell to their Ivy League rivals in both of last Sunday’s games, provoking both the dreaded mercy rule and a series loss. However, a focus on hard work and perseverance this past week certainly paid off for Harvard, who swept Brown (8-13, 1-5) in this weekend’s games.
Being on [our home field] brings a sort of comfort and confidence,” said long-time Harvard coach Jenny Allard. “I think we had a really tough week of practice and we really worked on a lot of things, so it was nice to see the team carry those things into the game this weekend.”
The Crimson certainly did not expect an easy matchup this weekend. The Bears, coming off of three hard-fought battles against the Cornell Big Red, seemed ready claw at Harvard’s hopes of winning the series – but for Brown, this proved to be a task too hard to bear.
“I think all three [games] were a really tough battle,” said Crimson captain Katie Duncan. “Brown is a really good team and they’re going to do a lot of damage in the Ivy League this year. They swing really hard, so to be able to walk away with three wins was really huge for us.”
A Harvard sweep was far from set in stone earlier in the weekend. In fact, during the first few innings of Saturday’s matchup, the Crimson’s hopes of any sort of victory seemed to be lost. With Brown up 5-0 at the top of the third, the game seemed to be in the Bears’ hands – but that’s when Duncan took the mound. After a pair of rapid-fire strikeouts ended Brown’s hitting streak, RBI line drives by freshman Megan Welsh and junior Isabelle Haugh yanked Harvard out of the gutter. Morgan Melito’s mashing of a meatball-down-the-middle tied the game for the Crimson, and two more runs were added in the bottom of the sixth for emphasis. A flawless late-game performance by Duncan kept the Bears from rounding the bases, resulting in a 7-5 win for Harvard.
Sunday’s wins proved to be much more straightforward for the Crimson. Duncan’s matinee showing of “Shutout: The Sequel” held Brown to a 2-0 loss, and Schiffhauer’s sixth inning home-run in Harvard’s final showdown of the weekend neatly wrapped up the squad’s final, 6-2 victory.
Of course, with the this year’s star-studded leadership, it is not at all difficult to understand why Harvard’s games against Brown went so well for the Crimson. When both captains were asked to name the player they thought had the biggest impact on this weekend’s victories, each pointed to the other as series MVP.
“Katie [Duncan]’s start for us today was huge,” Schiffhauer said. “The big zero on the scoreboard was pivotal for us going into Game Three, especially to have the opportunity to sweep. The same thing with yesterday – I mean she came in when Grace [Krantz] had a tough outing and really picked her up this weekend so that was great for us.”
“I liked Schiff’s homerun,” responded Duncan with a laugh. “I thought it was really great.”
However, Harvard’s softball squad is not done just yet. Though the team certainly exceeded expectations this weekend, Coach Allard admits that there’s still work to be done.
“We got a lot of work to do,” Allard said. “For us, it’s all about getting to our best, so we’re going to identify, we’re going to watch a lot of film, we’re going to figure out what we need to make adjustments to – we’re still not having as many quality at bats as we’d like and we’re still giving some pitches away, so we just need to tighten those things up.”
“We’re going to enjoy these three wins, but then on Monday it’s back to work,” Schiffhauer added. “We’re working toward being the best team we can be, and we know we’re not even close to being there yet.”
A brisk Tuesday crusade against Holy Cross precedes the Crimson’s next Ivy League series against Columbia, but if this weekend’s games provided any indication, neither matchup will be a significant roadblock on Harvard’s journey to the Ivy League title. And with Coach Allard a single victory away from her 300th win, another weekend series at home may be just what the Crimson need.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three individual All-America Honors. Two National Championships. One NCAA and United States record. This was the weekend of Dean Farris.
In addition to all of the individual accolades, Harvard placed eighth as a team at the Men’s Swimming and Diving NCAA National Championships, which were held in Austin, Texas on March 27-30. The Crimson finished with 132 total points, making it the best finish by the team since the 1960-61 season, as well as the first top 10 finish by an Ivy League school in 50 years.
The NCAA National Championships marked the end of the swimming season that began back in early November. Harvard sent six swimmers, as well as four alternates that could swim in relays, to compete in Austin.
“This year, we focused a lot more on individualistic training than in previous years to ensure that each swimmer got exactly the right training that was meant for them,” said Coach Kevin Tyrrell. “Heading into NCAAs, we wanted to make sure that each swimmer had everything they needed in order to compete.”
The first day was relatively quiet in terms of the number of events, but the Crimson made sure to make plenty of noise. The only race of the day was the 800-yard freestyle relay swam by the junior, Farris, senior Brennan Novak, sophomore Mahlon Reihman, and sophomore Corban Rawls. Farris swam the first leg of the relay and his performance was one for the ages.
In his leg, Farris swam the 200-yard freestyle in 1:29.15, which set the NCAA and United States record for that event. The previous record of 1:29.50 was set by Townley Haas of the University of Texas, Austin at last season’s NCAA Championships. “It was pretty surreal. I was in a lot of pain at first, but once the relay finished and everything set in, I was pretty overwhelmed,” said Farris when asked about his initial reaction to setting the record.
The team ended up placing seventh in the 800-yard freestyle relay and earned All-America honors. Despite all of the chaos, there were still many more events to follow for the Crimson.
The second day began with the 200-yard freestyle relay swam by junior Raphael Marcoux, Farris, freshman Umitcan Gures, and senior Grant Goddard. After setting a Harvard record with a time of 1:16.43 in the prelims, the team posted a 1:18.06 time in the finals. The performance earned the team eighth place in the event, as well as another All-America honor.
Soon after, Novak returned for a solo race in the 500-yard freestyle. With a time of 4:21.72, Novak earned an eighth place finish in the event. Novak was also able to obtain All-America honors in the process, and earned more points for the Crimson team overall.
Finally, Farris returned to the pool for the quick 50-yard freestyle race. In the preliminary heat, Farris broke his own school record of 19.16 set last year with a 18.92 finish. Shortly after, he followed up with a 19.02 in the finals, which garnered a sixth place finish and an All-America recognition for the Atlanta native.
The third day kicked off with a bang, with Farris picking up right where he left off. In the 100-yard backstroke, Farris put up an astonishing time of 43.66. The time not only earned Farris a first place finish and a national championship, but was also the second fastest time in history. The only other person to post a faster time is Olympic gold-medalist Ryan Murphy, who put up a 43.49 time in 2016 at the University of California, Berkeley.
Not too long later, Farris returned to swim the 200-yard medley relay alongside Gures, Marcoux, and junior Daniel Chang. After an 11th place finish in the prelims, the team put up a time of 1:24.68 in the championships. Although the time in the finals bumped the team back to 13th place in the event, Harvard still earned an Honorable Mention All-America recognition to close out the night.
The fourth and final day of the national championships saw Farris return for one last solo and team race. Although he had to wait all day for his events, the junior made his way back to the blocks for the 100-yard freestyle final. In his last individual race of the 2018-2019 season, Farris posted a time of 40.80, which not only earned him a first place finish and his third individual All-America distinguishment, but also marked his second national championship in two days. Further, the time was the third-fastest showing in the 100-yard freestyle in history.
When reflecting on the accomplishments, Farris said, “It means a lot (to me). My teammates and coaches pushed me a lot this year to get those performances at NCAAs. The confidence in my training definitely helped me stay confident during the race.”
By winning two national championships in the same year, Farris also added his name to the Crimson history books in another way. He joined Dave F. Hawkins ‘56 and William Kendall ‘40 to become just the third swimmer in Harvard history to win multiple national championships in the same season.
To cap off the meet, Harvard had Farris, Marcoux, Gures, and Rawls all return for the 400-yard freestyle relay. The team finished in 10th place and earned its second Honorable Mention All-America accolade of the meet with a new school record time of 2:49.88.
Harvard finished the meet in eighth place with 132 points, making it the school’s best finish in the past 56 years. “We’ve been preparing for the NCAA championships all year. We’ve had a focus on the meet since the start of the season, and we used our performance at Ivies to set up this top eight finish,” said Farris.
While many continue to be in awe of the performance Farris put up, Coach Tyrrell is not surprised. “Dean has had this coming for the past ten, twelve, fourteen years,” he said. “He has worked very hard for it and improved his backstroke and freestyle.”
With a relatively young team, it will be interesting to see what the Crimson do next season. “I’m looking forward to enjoying this top eight finish with my teammates and then resetting for the summer and next year. I want to continue to get better and enjoy swimming fast with my team,” said Farris.
It will not be easy to top the feats accomplished this year, but the future looks very bright for Dean Farris and the Harvard men’s swimming and diving program.

It’s no secret that sometimes Harvard says things that make everyone wonder who exactly is behind all of the decisions and emails. Whether you take comfort in the wholesome predictability(nothing better than a #transformative experience) or you revel in the latest screenshot-worthy statement, Harvard is never at a loss for words. Here are some of our favorites.

Harvard: “The University will remain open for normal operations”
No amount of ice and snow can keep us from our studies, right? Yes, it may be freezing outside, but that’s what Canada Goose jackets were made for! By now, we all know that school is usually cancelled everywhere but here — nothing like sliding down the steps of Widener after a long day of classes.

Harvard: “Yardfest is going to be on a Sunday afternoon”
If you thought that the sole purpose of Sunday was to mourn the upcoming week, Harvard is here to prove you wrong. Wipe away those tears and dance on over to that pre-Yardfest block party, because there’s no better time to party than on a brisk April Sunday afternoon. Broad daylight as a beautiful backdrop for forming memories of a lifetime? Count us in. We all love ourselves a good once-per-semester darty!

Harvard: “Yard Closure this Friday – Please Plan Accordingly”
The annual Student Involvement Fair and the Head Of the Charles Regatta: just two of a select number of days every year where Harvard finds a way to be more exclusive than it already is. In all seriousness, we know that these Yard closures work to maintain safety during our school’s particularly hectic and high-profile events. We’re just glad we no longer have to endure this kind of bag check security every time we stumble out of Lamont.

Harvard: “Stay hydrated”
It seems like Harvard jumps at every opportunity to remind us to do the thing that keeps us alive… strange. Sometimes they sprinkle in a loving “make sure you eat enough”, and remember the Sleep 101 module? We really don’t understand why they feel the need to remind us of these things. Truly stumped on this one.
No one:
Harvard: “Optimal buzz”
Again, there seems to be a pattern here. Props to Harvard for making sure that Freshman start their college experience with a good community-building meme before they even get to campus.

Harvard: “A transformative experience –”
All Dean Khurana wants is for us to get the most out of these four years, and we had to turn it into a meme. Kids these days. Must everything be a meme? (Yes.)
