After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PARIS—Forgetting that patriotism became a taboo in Europe over half a century ago, Americans tend to conceptualize Bastille Day as the French version of July Fourth. Accordingly, they picture people wrapped in French flags, sporting improbable blue-white-red outfits and Phrygian caps.
While this portrait may accurately describe the attendees of a themed party thrown at a French consulate in the United States, it does not seem to match the demeanor of French citizens on their national holiday.
“We don’t really celebrate le quatorze juillet,” all of my Parisian acquaintances told me when I asked them what the locals do on the occasion. Some of them had planned to use the long July 14 weekend to visit relatives outside Paris. Others had decided to leave France altogether.
One French friend of mine agreed to spend the day with me and other internationals, but she specified that she did it only because she wanted to hang out with us: She had no interest in the festivities themselves.
We decided to camp on a packed Champ de Mars at around dinnertime in order to get a decent view of the 35-minute fireworks display set off from the Eiffel Tower. We raised barriers made of wine bottles around us to mark our territory, and we set up our picnic. We felt very French, celebrating Bastille Day with fresh baguettes, cheese, and macaroons.
However, we hardly heard any French spoken around us for the whole night. We heard lots of American English, a fair amount of Spanish, some Chinese, but very little French. Ironically, the theme of this year’s fireworks display was “Paris welcomes the world.” Indeed, the whole world was there to commemorate the birth of the French Republic—the whole world but France itself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It begins by falling in love with a name in a history book. Then comes the search for the details behind the name, then the gradual work to rebuild the world around it. Soon the name grows into a Person, someone I know but can never meet.
I chased my latest name (Margaret) to an archive in London. There were her letters—God, her handwriting!—and the first one, dated 1925, was to her friend Caroline and “completely private.”
“Try + arrange that [it doesn’t] get inserted in your biography,” she wrote. She had penned the note nearly a century ago, but I flushed guiltily when I read it.
I had been planning on citing her letters in a stage play – but Margaret had become a Person, and she’d caught me red-handed.
Historical research can be fascinating and beautiful and challenging and mysterious, but the first time I learned that wasn’t in an archive. It was in a theater.
The play was Tom Stoppard’s “Arcadia,” in which two historians meet on an estate in the British countryside while researching the transition from the Enlightenment to Romanticism. Their historical subjects appear onstage too, not knowing their lives will be scrutinized 200 years later, revealing pieces of the historical puzzle as—or before—the historians discover it.
“Arcadia” mixed passionate love and the search for knowledge into beautiful disorder. Love spilled over into everything: the searches through piles of irrelevant historical documents, the thrill of finding a missing link, the intellectual sparring, the dangers of doing sloppy research.
In its famous final scene, the play’s two time periods exist onstage simultaneously. Hannah Jarvis, one of the historians, sits within breathing distance of her historical actors when she solves the final piece of her historical puzzle, and none of them realize.
Professor Louis Menand described writing biography as molding a character. As you read more and more about your historical actor, he said, you continuously reshape your mental image of who they are.
Theater, I think, works in much the same way. Like archival material, a script can give only so much information. It is the theatermaker’s responsibility to create, then tweak, a character whose actions and words match their echoes on the page. As in biography, the ultimate goal is to create a character who is as close to fully-realized as possible.
But dramatizing history is a contentious topic, and historical characters can’t always find a home onstage. Historians have, time and time again, critiqued dramatic narratives for spreading Whig history—narratives of history which frame the past as a progression towards the inevitable present. Many contend that showing the public only the digestible versions of complex realities is destructive to understanding the past, present, and future. “Dump the destructive ‘March of Progress’ narratives!” historians call out. “Discard those presentist lenses of good and evil, truth and falsehood! People will think that’s how life works!”
So plays about history exist in a formal limbo. They inhabit the shadowlands between fact and fiction, stretched taut between expectations that they will be both dramatic and instructive. But when fiction professes to deal in facts, the collateral damage can be serious.
“Look at ‘Copenhagen’ by Michael Frayn instead,” some historians suggest., “Hhe did it well. That play embraces the ambiguity of the historical events it dramatizes. We don’t know what really happened when Heisenberg and Bohr met in Copenhagen in 1941. In history, that ambiguity is a problem that needs to be solved. In Frayn’s play, the ambiguity is the whole point.”
But is there only room for a historical play that is self-aware?
There can’t be, and there mustn’t be.
A play will not shape or destroy the academic discipline of history. Any play “based on a true story” remains just that. Audience members who take that fiction as truth are most likely also guilty of giving a Whig history of their morning.
So put history onstage, I say—sometimes, fictionalization is worth the risk. Stories are the way people and events embed themselves in public consciousness. You package moments in narratives so that people can remember them and think: yes, this still matters.
What did Lord Byron do that day, and why? the historian asks in chorus with the playwright. We are all asking the same questions, and answering them in different ways.
“It’s wanting to know that makes us matter,” Stoppard’s Hannah Jarvis says, and the audience nods along.
The proper, footnoted history will always be more complex than its stage counterpart—lives are always messier than the ways we can communicate them. But the stageplay reminds us to keep looking back: there is something there. It reminds us to look to the past for the Persons, not just the names,; to remember that these were people who were made of flesh and blood, just like the actors now temporarily bearing their names.
“Come to me,” the theater says, “and I will teach you to continue to want to know, to look to the past for that which is fascinating and beautiful and challenging and mysterious, and perhaps not as distant as it may seem.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard officials discovered that its Faculty and central administrative networks suffered a cyber attack late last month, a blow that prompted administrators to request that thousands of students and employees change their passwords.
And according to experts in cyber security, there may be nothing that Harvard and institutions like it can do to fully protect themselves from future attacks.
Harvard has long been a target for assaults on its information technology systems. Christian Hamer, Harvard's chief information security officer, said in 2013 that the University’s servers see tens of thousands of cyber attacks a day.
The most recent incident, which officials said they discovered on June 19, marks the highest profile cyber security breach at Harvard since the University’s official website was hacked by the Syrian Electronic Army to display images of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in 2011. The website of the Institute of Politics was also hacked in April, allegedly by a pro-Palestinian group.
But the problem is not unique to Harvard, according to experts. Cyber attacks have hit institutions for years, but they have significantly increased in profile recently, according to Ryan Ellis, a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. And since the creation of the internet, they have been steadily on the rise as more and more people surf the Web and use electronic devices each day, said Tad J. Oelstrom, the director of the National Security Program at the Kennedy School of Government.
An institution like Harvard is especially attractive to hackers, Oelstrom added, because the information stored in the network is “marketable.” James Burns, a technical consultant at Information Risk Management, said information stored on Harvard’s network could reach into corporate, government, and potentially military realms, which could spark the interest of hackers recruited by countries to advance their national goals.
The sources of cyber security breaches vary: “There are so many ways to get into systems nowadays,” Oelstrom said. But one possible source of the recent breach at Harvard, he said, is a corrupted email, in which a user clicks on a specific link and allows access to Harvard’s network.
Burns suggested that regardless of the method of the breach, it was likely a less sophisticated one. “[Hackers] have exploited old, common, or human weaknesses to gain access,” Burns said.
Oelstrom said changing and strengthening passwords can help prevent phishing, a type of email fraud used to gather a user’s private information. But both Burns and Oelstrom emphasized that Harvard, and other institutions, will never be fully immune to cyber security incidents like this one.
“It will nearly always be possible to trick someone into visiting a malicious website or opening a malicious attachment,” Burns said.
Oelstrom said he does not expect Harvard to release a report about the hack, as it would likely inform future perpetrators of preventative measures within Harvard’s networks.

Public Service Announcement: The Game starts two and a half hours later this year.
We’re guessing that the 2:30 p.m. start time, a bit later than the traditional noon, doesn’t mean too much for the football team. But for those of us who make it down to New Haven for the annual day of revelry on Nov. 21, it means more time to pregame.
(Before the tailgate, maybe you can sleep in, fit in a real brunch, make a mixed drink instead of subsisting on Rubinoff out of the bottle—or you could just drink for longer.)
