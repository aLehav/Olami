After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Drake is misunderstood. He is, undoubtedly, one of the foremost musical talents of our generation. His music video for “Hotline Bling” is a subtle subversion of the roles that laziness, idiocy, and talentlessness play in each of the musical genres that Drake straddles: pop, rap, R&B, and hip-hop. This humble critic is not stating that Drake is lazy—that would miss the point of the artistic merit of Drake’s music. This humble critic is stating precisely the opposite. Admittedly, Drake’s music and music videos may appear to have been produced by a wealthy 12-year-old after a tear-soaked middle school breakup, who’s asked his parents for money to hire a songwriter (the phrase “ghostwriter” would be derogatory to ghosts) to lament said breakup, convinced his parents to shell out even more money for studio time, realized that he does not actually want to record the song, half-heartedly recorded one take in the early hours of a Sunday morning, and released the lazy, poorly written, sullen song to the irrationally expectant public as his parents disappointedly look at the colossal waste of space that is their son.
Disregard that impression. Drake only gives one the sense that he expends little effort and barely cares about his music precisely because he is simultaneously subverting and complicating the role that not trying at all plays in music. To understand this act of artistic genius, look no further than the music video for “Hotline Bling.”
Why does Drake move as if his crew only had time to record one take? Why does he wave his arms and legs in an apparent satire of ill-conceived, rhythmless dance? Why does he stand on a set that looks like it was designed by a minimalist 9th grader who was enamored with his geometry teacher and fixated on “Waiting for Godot”? Precisely to make the audience think that he has put minimal effort into the music video. The rhyming of “bling” and “thing” (not to mention the rhyming of “out” with “stressed out”) deliberately comments on lyricism’s descent into incomprehensible unintelligence.
The perceived lack of effort put into this artistic polemic is, in fact, a meticulously crafted expression of Drake’s own frustrations about the quality and effort put into the genre of pop(ular) music. It is as if Drake is saying, “This is all it takes to make ‘good’ music now? Maybe you, musically illiterate audience member, should reevaluate your incomprehensibly bad taste in music. Maybe you, listening fool, should ask yourself why you value the laziest rappers (no offense intended to Lil Uzi Vert and the artist formerly known as Kanye West) over anyone with a semblance of lyricism. Does it reflect the fact that you want to be successful in your life without giving any effort whatsoever? Or the fact that you want to be successful while wasting any talent you once had?” Drake demands that the audience think. Drake commands the audience to self-reflect.
If “Hotline Bling” presents a satire of pop within the scope of one song, “More Life” is satire in album form. It is a formless album that manages to produce not one above-average song in over 81 minutes. But implicitly, and quite brilliantly, it forces the listener to reevaluate the society and the state of a culture that allows “More Life” to be considered acceptable music—a culture that allows “More Life” to shatter any semblance of a streaming record in its first week. This is a cognizant effort on the part of Drake: he has meticulously crafted an album in which he has managed to convince each featured artist, from Kanye West to Young Thug, to present the worst, most atonal version of themselves in order to construct a sonic document that is a wide ranging argument for the death of rap, pop, hip-hop and R&B. The lack of effort in every song is relentlessly consistent. The listener comes to understand that this piece of artistic brilliance is a conscious and clever thesis about the death of music, the death of effort, and the death of talent.
For that, this humble critic must thank Drake. He has constructed a piece of art that is nothing short of Narcissus' looking glass—it is the most honest reflection of the state of music today. “More Life” holds a mirror up to the idiocy of any fool that listens to Drake in their spare time (like your humble critic) and asks with disarming honesty, in the spirit of Jamaica Kincaid’s “Lucy”: How did you get to be this way?

In the not-so-distant future, rising global temperatures have melted the ice caps and flooded human settlements. The poor, unable to afford escape, are forced to remain in the dangerous coastal regions where they are vulnerable to the tides, while the rich have fled to inland deserts where they live in artificially controlled environments, collectively called the “Dryside.” It also happens that present-day racial inequalities in America have worsened, with most of the “Floodsoes,” those living in the flooded areas, being black and Latino while Dryside is predominantly white. Although the premise itself risked being an oversimplified parable about systemic social injustice, director and playwright Aislinn E. Brophy ’17, who created this play for her Theater, Dance, and Media senior thesis, has created a complex and surprising world.
The play’s greatest strength lies in the relationships between its characters, which are so intimate and realistic that it feels almost like a violation of privacy to be listening in. The story centers around strong-willed Larina, a teacher in a grossly underfunded public school in the flood zone, played by the charismatic Carla Troconis ’19. She is Latina and was born in the area. As one of the few to get out through the public school system, she returns to help young students like her do the same. She is in an unhappy relationship with Jax, a well-meaning white relief worker from the Dryside, played by Henry M.N. Brooks ’19. Their lives intertwine with those of the married couple who just moved in from the Dryside, starry-eyed Peter and bubbly Agave, played by Caleb M. Lewis ’17 and Eliza B. Mantz ’18, respectively.
Placing real-world social problems in a parallel world works well in “Dryside.” Larina’s voice serves as an outlet for current tensions and uncertainties about race, class, and politics. Larina feels ambivalent about the implicitly privileged position of white Drysider relief workers like her boyfriend, and the play puts the idealism of advocacy and volunteer work to the test.
The actors are skilled at expressing unsaid thoughts and emotions through eloquent gestures. None of the characters seem morally perfect or better than another. They are all well-intentioned and aware of their particular privileges, but what they really want often come[S] into conflict with their loyalties and duties. The characters are each so relatable and intriguing that the show could have focused on any one of the four and worked well.
The show added another layer of complexity with the paradoxical reverence the Floodsoes have for the very ocean that threatens to destroy them. Four mute, languid dancers (Meghan Onserio ’19, Abby D.K. Duker ’19, Matthew Munroe ’17, and Irla Belli ’20) portrayed the sea. With stunning choreography by Zaria Smalls ’19, Joel W. Bateman ’17, Rob Rush ’18, and Margaret Canady ’20, the dancers personified the mystery and insurmountable power of nature. The stars appeared intermittently as seven women in the aisles of the orchestra seats, singing music with otherworldly harmonies by Eden H. Girma ’18, led by the rapping queen star, Maia, played by Skylar Bree-Takyi ’20 in a pink faux fur jacket. The divine power of the sea and stars at once seems like it could be a metaphor for the hopeless entrenchment of social inequality today, that all people, rich or poor, are equal in the face of imminent death at nature’s hands.

Can we save free speech from current attacks?
In March, my name and photo were posted at Professor Watchlist. The site announces: “students, parents, and alumni deserve to know the…names of professors that advance a radical agenda in lecture halls.” In my case, the website claims, “She said that the rise of Donald Trump is just like the rise of Hitler.” The website links to a February 2016 op-ed that I wrote as a Washington Post contributing columnist.
I wrote: “Like any number of us raised in the late 20th century, I have spent my life perplexed about exactly how Hitler could have come to power in Germany. Watching Donald Trump’s rise, I now understand. Leave aside whether a direct comparison of Trump to Hitler is accurate. That is not my point. My point rather is about how a demagogic opportunist can exploit a divided country.”
The site provides no documentation of my having made arguments comparing Trump to Hitler in the classroom—because there is none. I have never made such a comparison in class, not even in the attenuated form in my opinion piece.
I have three distinctive public roles: professor, author and opinion columnist, and engaged citizen. Each role has distinct responsibilities and provides different fora for expression. As a professor, I believe my job is to educate students in the areas of my scholarly expertise and to focus class on the subject at hand, not the day’s political issues. As an opinion columnist, I apply my expertise directly to the issues of our time, hoping to shed light. As an engaged citizen, I pursue political outcomes that best align with my considered assessment of the public interest. Across all these roles, I seek to discern and express the truth, while also embracing humility about human fallibility.
I teach across historical and contemporary topics. As I do, I talk a lot about democracy and, yes, argue for egalitarian accounts of democratic ideals. I also present other, competing views and invite students to make judgments. For instance, I criticize Plato’s anti-egalitarian positions but do my best to offer the strongest possible account of his position. I aspire to equip students to ask meaningful questions, to understand evidence and what makes a good argument, and to take responsibility for making their own judgments about hard questions. I strongly distinguish values-based analysis from partisan deliberation and never advocate partisan positions in class.
I treasure academic freedom but also believe that teachers should avoid politicizing the classroom. To my mind, full-throated political engagement belongs on op-ed pages and in the hard work of citizenship. That said, faculty members should not be “watchlisted” if they make other judgments than mine about how to deploy academic freedom.
My watchlisting did not, of course, end with the website. Site founder, Charlie Kirk, appeared with Tucker Carlson on Fox News to highlight his postings.  Alongside a broadcast of my photo, Kirk said this: “She wrote an op-ed. She made a very flawed argument. She teaches this in class. That the rise of Donald Trump can be directly paralleled to the rise of Adolf  Hitler. This is a Harvard Professor. She teaches that we can learn a lot from this rise of Donald Trump and this populist rise because actually it is very similar to that of Adolf Hitler.”
I don’t think Kirk actually knows anything about what I teach. His claim is simply false. So what’s he up to? Why watchlist me in 2017 for a February 2016 article?
Here’s my best guess. As an engaged citizen, I have served for the past year on the Advisory Board to the U.S. Programs branch of the Open Society Foundations, George Soros’ philanthropic initiative. OSF works in support of areas like investigative journalism and voting rights, criminal justice reform and immigration policy. The organization is separate from Soros’ personal political donations. In March, I agreed to chair that advisory board. The Watchlist posting and Fox segment appeared shortly after the announcement.
Kirk’s site and Carlson’s former blog, the Daily Caller, are both reported to have been funded by conservative activist and multimillionaire Foster Friess, and Kirk claims to be a Trump administration advisor on matters of concern to millennials.
The hit on me was a punch at Soros, I believe.
Whatever the motive, the posting and broadcast brought me vile emails, tweets, and the following two anonymous voicemails:
“Hey, you f*****g c**t, you. Professor Watchlist b***h.”
“Yeah, yeah, Danielle. You’re a lowlife f*****g n****r motherf*****g c**t, you know that? Saying what you say about Trump. You f*****g n****r b***h. F*****g scum. I hope he pisses on your grave some day. Ah, you’ll outlive him but maybe his kid will piss on your f*****g grave and shit on it.”
Free speech is under threat. In early March, I wrote an op-ed criticizing Middlebury protesters and praising Charles Murray for courage. I believe that bad arguments should be defeated with better ones, not shut down by violent protest or blocked with profanity and ad hominem attacks. At Harvard, a student group has sprung up to sponsor controversial speakers and to challenge spreading protest dynamics. I concur with the need to reclaim space for free speech. And free speech also needs protection from assaults from the right. Both sides have developed dangerous tactics for silencing those who disagree with them.
What’s the antidote? Surely the truth—steadily, objectively, decently conveyed.

The saga following the National Labor Relations Board’s August decision to allow graduate students conducting teaching and research to vote on unionization was recently further complicated by the prospect of a second election. The NLRB ruled earlier this month that, due to errors on the University’s part in determining voter eligibility, the inconclusive election should be re-held if the measure failed. Harvard’s representatives, calling the election fair, have objected to the ruling and may file an appeal.
The details of the campaigns for and against unionization, which continued well past the day of the vote, are complex, and both sides have dedicated significant time and effort. On one level, it is unfortunate that there has been no immediate resolution of this issue. More importantly, though, it is in the best interests of both parties to hold the re-vote the NLRB has called for so as to ensure that the wishes of the student body are carried out.
The eligibility criteria first specified by the University were opaque. Some votes were provisionally cast under the stipulation that their validity would be determined after the election, illustrating the need for a new vote with clearly delineated and disseminated eligibility criteria. If need be, the University should even consider confirming voter eligibility at the time of the vote.
The importance of this election is underscored by the precedents set by unionization votes at Harvard and its peer institutions. It is critical to establish constructive interaction between the union’s advocates and detractors, and Harvard should hold itself to the highest standard and go forward with the second election.
We realize that a new vote will put an unfortunate strain on the University’s resources, as this past cycle has shown that holding an election is no small task. While this is regrettable, we hope the University willingly shoulders the burden of increasing democracy in its student body. We believe this is necessary to make sure opinions are properly expressed as well as to establish amicable relations among the labor organizers, union opponents, and the University, something that will benefit all parties for years to come.
Ultimately, we stand by our opinion that unionization has real advantages, such as greater bargaining power for students who wish for more benefits, and drawbacks, such as the challenges of a heterogenous group being represented by one union. Nevertheless, we continue to believe that is an option that the student body has the right to select if they so choose. In ensuring that the wishes of Harvard’s students are carried out, the University must acknowledge the flaws in the original election and remedy them by holding a new, more transparent, one.

The longer I live, the more I realize how difficult reading is.
For example, I tried to read George Orwell’s political novella “Animal Farm” when I was nine, and I hated it. I had no idea that it was an allegory about the 1917 Russian Revolution and a critique of Joseph Stalin and his communist Soviet Union. Totally oblivious, I quickly got bored of reading about a group of bossy pigs ordering around a bunch of horses and hens.
I kind of missed Orwell’s point.
An entire school of literary critique argues that it’s impossible to read a text and know the author’s intent. If you’ve ever been asked to do a “close reading” or “formal analysis” of a poem, you’ve encountered this school of thought. It teaches you to ignore outside research and analyze only what you find within a text, because we can only be sure about what’s written.
Theorists have struggled with this issue for decades, and many have concluded that there is simply no way to ensure that readers accurately understand what an author is trying to say. If you’re a writer, you must accept that you cannot control how people will interpret your work once you publish it.
As a writer myself, this makes me feel a little uncomfortable. But as a lover of clothes, it bothers me constantly.
Expressions like “reading a situation” or “emotion written on one’s face” illustrate how life is just one extended reading assignment. A lot of visual information is thrown at us, and we in turn must try to process it.
I can think of countless times when I thought my outfit said something about me but it was interpreted it in a completely unexpected way. Sometimes, the stakes are low or nonexistent, like the time I wore a Grateful Dead t-shirt and someone assumed I was a fan of the band. In actuality, I just like drawings of skulls, and this shirt featured a particularly unique one.
Other times, though, the stakes are much higher. Hypothetically, if I were to dress a random female college student in a revealing outfit—imagine an extremely short, tight dress with a plunging neckline—and send her onto the street, passersby would judge her in a variety of ways.
She might get catcalled by someone who sees her outfit as a cry for sexual attention. A person with conservative values might think she did not look respectable or perhaps seemed sleazy. A third-wave feminist would argue that this outfit has nothing to do with attracting sexual attention, that this woman is dressing for herself, and that we should congratulate her for exercising confidence and agency in her dress.
And no matter which reaction you think is appropriate, you may never know what drove the woman to wear the dress in the first place. In this hypothetical scenario, the woman has neither low self-esteem, as the conservative might think, nor high self-esteem, as the feminist would guess—she’s wearing the outfit because I told her to.
I experienced this in a dramatic way this semester while researching and writing a twenty-page paper about a pair of wedge sandals I had seen in Vogue Magazine. Over the course of two months—as I read countless books, scholarly articles, and encyclopedia entries—I became convinced that these shoes referenced Birkenstocks and the hippie movement of the sixties. This led me to suggest that the designer harmfully appropriated the culture of black jazz musicians as well as that of poor people in America. A few days before handing in the essay, I showed my roommate a picture of the shoes. To her, they looked like a high-fashion version of Scandinavian clogs.
For a long time, I thought that the power of clothes lay in their ability to speak to the rest of the world on behalf of their wearer. I’ve always told myself that clothing is important to study because it is how we project our personality, heritage, and values to people who meet us. Now, I think that this is a bit naïve, as you can do as much reading and researching as you like and still never guess at what someone is trying to say about themselves based on their outfit. Clothing, like books or art or music, means something different to each person who sees it.
Why does it matter what we wear? I’m no longer satisfied by the answer I used to give—that our clothes help us present our unique identity to the rest of the world. I think it’s a cliché. I’m not even sure if it’s always true. Sometimes, we misunderstand. Sometimes, we’re misunderstood.
Maybe the solution to this problem is simply to understand that it exists, and to heed the advice of Walt Whitman—who said, “Be curious, not judgmental”—when we’re looking at how others are dressed and find ourselves jumping to conclusions. Though clothes certainly have much to say about a person, we must remember that they can never tell all.

Winthrop House was awarded the 2017 Straus Cup—the intramural sports championship prize—for the third consecutive year after the House Intramural Program drew to a close on Friday.
The Straus Cup is awarded to the House that has garnered the most number of points at the end of the spring season. Approximately fifty students gathered in the Quincy House courtyard Friday afternoon to observe the presentation of the top prize along with awards to individual IM participants, referees, and teams.
The Harvard Athletics Department oversees the House Intramural Program in which all 12 upperclassmen Houses and Dudley participate in each year. Freshmen dorms compete in a separate intramural league for the Yard Trophy.
Student representatives in each of the Houses coordinate schedules and recruit students and tutors for the plethora of IM teams. Nicholas L. Larus-Stone ’17, who oversees IM sports for Winthrop House, said he has enjoyed watching the residents who come to the competitions.
“I think what’s great about Winthrop IMs is we have a lot of people come out. We’ve had over a 100 different athletes come out to our events, and IMs is all about participation, but it’s also about competition,” Larus-Stone said. “I’ve met a lot of people in the House through IMs and I just have a lot of fun going out there every day.”
This past season, Jackson Wagner ’19, a participant in Winthrop IMs, played soccer, crew, water polo, crew, rock climbing, and futsal for the House’s team.
“Winthrop IMs are super awesome because they’re a huge part of our House community,” Wagner said. “It’s where we get all the classes together to really bond as a House.”
While Houses compete in sports represented at the varsity level like basketball, volleyball, and soccer, they also play in more unique intramural athletic events. This year, the IM program had tournaments for dodgeball, inner tube water polo, and table tennis to name a few.
Winthrop resident Laura D. Schell ’18 enjoys participating in the diversity of IM sports like crew and spikeball.
“It’s all about meeting new people in your House and kind of bonding over fun competition with other Houses,” Schell said. “I really like inner tube water polo, it’s always a highlight for that tournament.”
Winthrop has won the Straus Cup eight out of the last ten years and eighteen times since the cup was first awarded in 1935. Currently, Winthrop holds second place in all-time standings for the coveted IM program prize behind Kirkland House which boasts 21 wins over the Straus Cup’s history.

Alumni, faculty, administrators, and students flocked to the Divinity School this weekend, celebrating its two centuries of existence with lectures, a panel of Harvard deans, and a bicentennial party, concluding a years-worth of festivities.
In her remarks at the party Friday afternoon, University President Drew G. Faust spoke about the growth of the Divinity School over its 200 years—from its origins as the first nonsectarian theological school to its current position as the most religiously-diverse divinity school in the United States, according to Faust.
“The rigorous encounter with multiple traditions, or with no tradition at all, is what makes Harvard Divinity School unlike any other place,” Faust said. 
“From a podium in Divinity Hall in 1838, [Ralph Waldo Emerson] addressed [the graduating class] with the daring and democratic and inclusive notion that the divine speaks within each of us and that, in Emerson’s words, ‘faith makes its own forms,’” she continued. “For 200 years, the Divinity School has made its own forms.”
Several hundred people also attended the panel “Religion Matters: HDS at Harvard University” on Friday, which was moderated by Divinity School Dean David Hempton and featured Law School Dean Martha L. Minow, Business School Dean Nitin Nohria, and Graduate School of Education Dean James E. Ryan.
The panel focused on the role of religious dialogue in interdisciplinary studies and ways to increase conversation between the graduate schools. Nohria, the Business School dean, said the connections between business and religion are often overlooked.
“There’s been a deep intellectual connection that capitalism grows out of certain religious groups that had a view of how to create work and that business was itself a way to do something that in the service of humanity and in service of God,” Nohria said. “The work that they thought that they were doing in founding these companies was as much a religious calling as anything else.”
Minow joked that “religion is present at the Harvard Law School before every exam” and detailed the connections between governmental and religious legal traditions.
“For a law school to be situated in the United States, the temptation is to think that there is only one legal system. We’ve worked really hard to locate the United States and the 50 states inside of many legal traditions,” she said. “We do view religion as a subject of study, an object of study, and comparative legal tradition is a big part of our education.”
Asked what “truly matters” to him, Ryan said that service—a cornerstone of many religious traditions—is fundamental to the mission of Graduate School of Education.
“If you have decided to go to the Harvard Graduate School of Education, you have decided, in effect, to dedicate your life to service in the form of serving others through education,” he said. “I think that’s an incredibly noble purpose, and I think we’re all better off, we’re all our best selves, when we remember that’s why we’re all here.”

Faculty will vote on whether or not to approve Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana’s proposed changes to the student handbook—including clarifying the University’s policy on marijuana and switching to gender-neutral language—at Tuesday’s faculty meeting.
Last November, Massachusetts residents voted to legalize the possession, recreational use, and eventual sale of marijuana. The state’s new policy on legal recreational use went into effect on Dec. 15, and the sale of recreational marijuana has been delayed by the state legislature until mid-2018. 
The student handbook currently states that the “possession, use, or distribution” of marijuana is a violation of Harvard policy. The proposed handbook changes would keep this prohibition, but add a clarifying statement about the change in state law.
“Although Massachusetts law now permits adults aged 21 or older to possess and consume marijuana under certain circumstances, federal law prohibits the possession, use, or distribution of marijuana, including for medical purposes, on Harvard property or as part of a Harvard activity,” the handbook would read.
Khurana will also move to include vaping as a prohibited activity under the College’s smoking policy: “This is also an opportune time to clarify the College’s stance on vaping. Following the approach taken by University efforts to implement tobacco-free policies on campus, the use of vaping in the Houses and dorms should be prohibited,” the memo reads.
The revised handbook also includes eliminated instances of gendered language in the handbook: For example, “his or her activities” would become “the student’s activities.” In the memo, Khurana writes that these revisions are “in keeping with the University’s articulation of belonging and inclusion.”
Other proposed changes include updated information about the General Education program, which will be in transition until the new program is fully rolled out in the fall of 2018, and policies on email extensions and taking exams in absentia.
The proposed edits come as some Faculty members call on Khurana to include a proposed expansion of the Honor Council’s role in the handbook, putting it to a Faculty vote. The Honor Council has been tasked with adjudicating cases of students in violation of the College’s social policy on single-gender social organizations, following a report from a committee charged with recommending how to implement that policy. Khurana accepted the committee’s recommendations in March.
Also on the agenda for Tuesday’s meeting, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris will present five-year reviews of the Electrical Engineering concentration, the Mechanical Engineering concentration, and the rules regarding the awarding of summa cum laude honors.
Extension School Dean Huntington D. Lambert and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith will also move that the Faculty approve the 2017-2018 courses of instruction for their respective schools.

UPDATED: May 1, 2017 at 8:23 p.m.
The Black Men’s Forum honored four Harvard seniors and one professor for their leadership and mentorship on campus at the 23rd annual Celebration of Black Women gala.
Around 225 people attended the celebration, which was held Saturday at the Knafel Center and featured speeches from civil rights activist Tamika D. Mallory and members of Harvard’s black community.
Four Harvard seniors—Olivia Castor ’17, Ezinne Nwankwo ’17, Osaremen F. Okolo ’17, and Laetitia T. Vessah ’17—received leadership awards for their racial justice activism and contributions to black student life.
Students nominated candidates through forms the Black Men’s Forum sent in November, according to BMF Vice President and the event’s chair Michael Reid ’18. After receiving nominations, the boards of black affinity groups on campus—including BMF and the Association of Black Harvard Women—voted on the top nominees.
BMF also named Sarah E. Lewis—an assistant professor of History of Art and Architecture and African and African American Studies—its Faculty Member of the Year, honoring a professor for the first time in the event’s history, Reid said.
“Professor Lewis has done so many things and is so well-educated,” Reid said. “She is again a perfect representation of the type of woman that we want to celebrate at CBW.”
Thalia M. Orphee, the outgoing president of ABHW, said all of the women honored at the event were known for their contributions to campus.
“The awardees are really known for the mentorship to the community, whether internally or externally. And I think that the awardees yesterday may not be doing a leadership position within a black community, but they made a presence on campus as black women,” Orphee said.
This year, Orphee and Reid said, BMF sought to make the annual event more inclusive by de-emphasizing its focus on gender and eliminating the event entrance fee.
“One of the things about CBW is the fact that, again, it’s a large emphasis on black women, but implicitly, what that does is put too much emphasis on gender and gender being the distinction between how to celebrate one another,” Reid said.
Event organizers also reworked a longstanding tradition of giving handwritten cards to black women who attended the event. According to Reid, the cards had formerly only been written by BMF members, but, this year, BMF allowed anyone to write a card regardless of gender.
“The point of CBW itself is that there is no one type of black woman. There is no one criteria or credential to honor a black woman,” Reid said.
Okolo said the event provided a place for black women to have “final moments of reflection” together on their accomplishments and impact on the College.
“As my time at Harvard is coming to a close...it was really nice to have a moment where I could culminate the work I’ve done and what I’ve contributed to campus,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard libraries will no longer charge 50 cent per day fees on overdue books.
The change, one of several detailed in a post on the Harvard Library system’s website, went into effect on April 1. Though standard fees have been eliminated, fees for overdue recalled material have been raised from two dollars a day to three dollars a day, with a 45 dollar maximum.
“The goals of these changes are to improve the student experience and embrace a ‘One Harvard’ approach for borrowing material across Harvard Library,” wrote Steven Beardsley, Harvard's associate director for access services administrative operations and special projects, in an email.
“We have witnessed firsthand the stress that overdue fines can cause for students,” Beardsley continued. “Eliminating standard overdue fines and standardizing loan periods across Harvard’s libraries should help students focus on their scholarship, rather than worrying about renewing library books every 28 days in order to avoid fines.”
Andrés M. López-Garrido ’18 praised the library system’s decision, noting his own history of incurring stiff fines for overdue books.
“I had over 100 dollars in overdue fines for books I checked out last summer for a research project, and I completely forgot to return them,” said López-Garrido. “I flipped out when I found out, but luckily I was given a waiver.”
Others are a bit more wary about how students will use this new freedom.
“I am interested to see how many books make it back to the library,” said Jad Maayah ‘20.
Beardsley wrote that he hopes the new approach will cause students to focus more on their work.
“We expect that this will allow students to devote more time to their research and coursework,” he wrote.
The library system also announced the institution of semester-long loan periods for Harvard affiliates.
“Undergraduates are now able to check out regular loan items at all Harvard libraries for a semester, eliminating the need to renew books every twenty-eight days from Lamont, for example,” Beardsley said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Albert Henrichs, a globally-renowned scholar of Greek literature and religion, died April 16. He was 74.
Born in Cologne, Germany, Henrichs was just 26 when he made his first major academic discovery.
“He took four lumps of leather in a cigar case from Cologne through to Vienna, and gave them to the conservator there to try and unpeel them,” recalled Kathleen M. Coleman, a Classics professor.
What Henrichs unveiled was a codex that detailed the origins of the Manichean religion, an early rival to Christianity, in far more detail than was previously known. Following this breakthrough, Henrichs was also the first to assemble and translate 46 fragments of papyrus from Cologne, which turned out to contain portions of an ancient Greek novel, called the “Phoinikika,” or “Phoenician Saga.”
This novel included “a hugely exciting scene of cannibalism,” in which, as Coleman described it, “the protagonist joined a band of robbers in Egypt and they murdered a boy, took out his heart, roasted it, applied olive oil and seasonings, cut it up, and ate it to swear an oath of allegiance to the gang.”
Henrichs joined the faculty at Harvard at age 30, and taught until just two months before his death. The 10th Eliot Professor of Greek Literature, much of Henrichs's later work was concerned with understanding the Greek god Dionysus and the role of the Chorus and dance in Greek tragedy. His colleague in the Classics department and former student David F. Elmer ‘98 described him as a “world authority on Greek religion.”
Henrich’s role in the Classics faculty was immense, Elmer said. He recalled that “the last thing that he was doing before he succumbed to his illness was reading an undergraduate thesis that he felt very interested in, because he had worked with that student before.”
Set to retire after the spring 2017 semester, Henrichs nevertheless taught a class on Herodotus with “heroic effort” this semester, his student Denis Fedin ’17 recalled.
“He had a tremendous joie de vivre, a love of life and of living. He was an extremely joyful person. A lot of the joy and pleasure in his life came from his love for the Greeks, he was truly fascinated by Greek culture,” Elmer said. “My bedside reading is usually some kind of novel or something like that, his was Demosthenes or Euripides.”
Henrichs insisted on addressing all of his students as “Mr.” and “Mrs.” because “he felt that if students were going to address him as Professor Henrichs it was only right and respectful that he addressed them by their title,” Elmer said. Still, behind Henrichs’s “imposing exterior,” Elmer remembered “a remarkably caring and generous person.”
This did not stop him, however, from being a fearsome questioner to his fellow scholars. “Many visitors to the department were apprehensive when they heard that Professor Henrichs would be in attendance,” Elmer recalled. “I can remember escorting speakers to the lecture hall, and they would ask me in a kind of quiet voice on the way, ‘Is Professor Henrichs going to be there?’ because they were nervous about facing him.”
Coleman summed up her view of Henrichs simply.
“He was really an inspiring teacher in the Latin etymology of that word. He breathed these subjects into his students,” she said.

With the end of classes, many Harvard undergraduates have traded textbooks for tuxedos for the beginning of a time-honored tradition that doesn’t involving cramming: House formal season.
Every semester, Harvard’s undergraduate Houses organize formal dance events for residents and friends. While the events take place during reading period and coincide with deadlines, they’ve been popular among the students who both plan and attend them.
The largest of House formals takes place in the Quad. The Pforzheimer, Currier, and Cabot House Committees collectively organized the Friday night event. Tickets,offered at $25 each, sold out well before Friday night and attracted students from the Quad and the River Houses alike.
“It was under a giant tent. The food area, the dancing, everything was in one place,” said attendee Amy Huang '17. “I think it’s something we don’t have on the river. There’s nothing that really brings the community together the way Quad formal brings the Quad community together."
While Quad formal was a collaboration between several Houses for a larger event, the Kirkland House committee put on a smaller gathering tailored to its residents.
“Kirkland formal differs from a lot of the other formals I go to, because here, I know everyone. It’s not one of the formals that a lot of outside people go to,” said Kirkland resident Thomas G. Dumbach '18.
The formal featured Kirkland students and tutors performing a music and a “very classic spring floral theme,” according to Dumbach.
At Winthrop House, construction necessitated a departure from the standard house formal layout.
“Unfortunately this year because of swing housing we don’t have a courtyard, but we’re doing it here in the [Harvard Inn],” Winthrop House Committee  Co-Chair Danielle O. Strasburger ’18 said.
Because of the construction, Winthrop changed the theme of the formal from the standard “Arabella Ball” of years past.
“We’re calling it Club Arabella this year to signify the fact that it’s a different vibe this year. It’s going to be a club, lounge feel with a dance floor and some chairs and tables and a cool light-up bar,” Strasburger said.
Because of the location change, Strasburger said she’s making extra efforts to improve turn out for the event.
“It’s tough being in the dining hall,” she said. “We’ve been working really hard to drum up excitement through word of mouth, really talking it up to people and explaining that it’s not just another d-hall party.”
Adams House will put on a “Beauty and the Beast” themed event Sunday, and Cleanna Crabill '19, the social chair of House Committee, said. She said attendance can be hard to predict.

The Undergraduate Council voted to fund menstrual hygiene products in some upperclassmen Houses in fall 2017 at their last general meeting of the semester on Sunday night.
The UC first endorsed the initiative—developed by the Harvard College Hygiene Campaign Club—three weeks ago. The money will come from the UC’s discretionary fund, a $46,000 fund available to any individual or committee that receives majority Council approval. The UC previously funded a program to provide tampons and other feminine hygiene products in Harvard Yard for freshmen. The Office of Student Life will look at the pilot program’s results before deciding whether to fund feminine hygiene products for a longer period of time.
Eudora L. Olsen ’17, Hygiene Campaign Club President, said she spoke to House Committee Chairs and College administrators with the hope of finding monetary support for the initiative. Olsen said that she and her group hoped to provide menstrual hygiene products in four Houses, and one House per neighborhood.
“I met with HoCos of several of the different Houses beyond just the four because we’ve been looking to garner financial support for this program. I’ve also met with Dean [of Students Katherine G.] O’Dair several times to talk about other possible sources of funding,” she said.
However, Olsen said the UC was the only remaining source of funding.
“For this next semester, there are no other sources of funding that we could depend on for the $1,700 this will cost,” she said.
Victor C. Agbafe ’19 said House Committees were previously hesitant to provide financial support for the program and asked if Olsen had spoken to each of the House committees in her search for funding.
Olsen said HoCos will only be responsible for distributing surveys and arranging meetings between building managers and members of the Hygiene Campaign Club. The pilot program is meant to gather data through surveys in the hopes that the College will fund it in the “long-term,” according to Olsen.
“The point of this pilot program is to gather data. So we’ll be giving out a survey, which has already been given to all of the houses....about what type of products people need, where they want them to be, and that sort of thing,” she said. “The data from this program and the program in the Yard is going to be invaluable for future funding sources that will be more stable.”
The legislation passed the Council unanimously.
The UC also voted to fund a party at Felipe’s Taqueria for undergraduates on May 3 as part of “Club 1636,” which started last year and provides students free food at various restaurants in Harvard Square.

After not offering counseling services for a year, Indigo Peer Counseling announced that it will once again provide counseling in the fall 2017 semester.
The group, which specializes in addressing issues related to race, class, and first-generation status went on hiatus last fall after it failed to meet the number of required counselors set by Harvard University Health Services for its peer counseling groups. Indigo has spent the last year periodically hosting outreach events with other peer counseling and cultural affinity groups and recruiting additional staff members.
Indigo stopped providing counseling because of a staffing shortage. Aakriti Prasai ’18, director of Indigo, pointed to a shift in leadership and lack of commitment over the summer as problems.
“We weren’t as ready as we could be and we didn’t want to present ourselves to the Harvard community without being fully ready,” Prasai said.
While Indigo originally planned to return during the spring semester, they ultimately decided to delay opening their peer counseling services in order to grow and train their staff.
“Logistics were quite hard. People were on J-term trips and things like that. So we realized, let’s really try and focus on getting our name out this semester and come the fall, go out and do what we intended to do,” Prasai said.
In addition to the training Harvard requires of all peer counselors, Indigo’s staff members will undergo additional activities to prepare them to serve people from diverse backgrounds such as “reading op-eds The Crimson or other publications have published” and inviting leaders from various communities to speak.
The group also decided to take some time to re-envision Indigo’s goals and role in the mental health community.
“It was a bit difficult because in a lot of the communities we tried to reach out to and that we are specialized to help serve…mental health is very stigmatized,” Prasai said. “Maybe our better mission should be is to make sure our service is more known about and make sure we have more events where we can get better and talk about things.”
Most recently, Indigo participated in Mental Health Week, hosted by the Student Mental Health Liaisons. Indigo hosted “Reflect and Look Forward” on Sunday to give students a chance to contemplate the past semester.
In the fall, Prasai said Indigo plans to offer various workshops and conversations in addition to peer counseling.
“Something that we’re thinking about for next semester is really targeting first-year students and maybe having informal chats like these on what it’s like being away from home, what it’s like looking for an internship,” she said.
According to an emailed statement from Chief of Counseling and Mental Health Services Barbara Lewis, Indigo will occupy its former space in Adams House H Entryway, and “a Harvard University Health Services Counseling and Mental Health Services counselor will continue to supervise the group.”
Prasai emphasized her belief in Indigo’s mission and stated that she “really wants to push it so it can blossom.”
“Logistically things will be difficult but we will be there next year,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard baseball team hasn’t exactly had a flair for the dramatic this season. In fact, the batsmen have only played three one-run Ivy League games, with all of them coming against Brown. However, on Thursday evening against UMass-Lowell, the Crimson offense came through when its back was against the wall, scoring four runs in the top of the ninth to down the River Hawks, 4-3. It was the final nonconference game of the season for Harvard (17-21, 5-11 Ivy League).
Holding a 3-0 edge, the River Hawks (20-17, 8-6 America East) summoned right-hander Max Frawley from the bullpen to try to pick up the game’s final three outs against a Crimson offense that entered the frame having mustered just four hits. Harvard shortstop Drew Reid had other plans. The senior ripped a double to start off the frame. Back-to-back walks to sophomore catcher Devan Peterson and second baseman Chad Minato loaded the bases, put the tying run on first, and ended the day for UMass-Lowell’s sixth hurler of the day.
The Crimson broke through with a lift from an unexpected bat. Harvard skipper Bill Decker called on seldom-used utilityman Jake Forte to pinch hit for junior outfielder Austin Black. Forte, who was a backup quarterback on the Harvard football team for his first three falls in Cambridge, entered the at-bat hitless in six collegiate plate appearances. The Dunwoody, Ga., native singled through the hole between shortstop and third base, driving in Reid and getting the Crimson within two runs.
Designated hitter Patrick Robinson delivered the big hit that the team has come to expect out of the sophomore. Robinson, who leads Harvard in batting average, home runs, runs batted in, and slugging percentage, doubled to drive home pinch runners Chad Minato and Chase Aldridge and tie the game at three. With still nobody out and two runners in scoring position, the Crimson appeared to be in prime position to break the contest open.
UMass-Lowell right-handed pitcher Nick Rand struck out sophomores Patrick McColl and John MacLean but uncorked a wild pitch that allowed Forte to score and put the guests up a run. Freshman right-hander Grant Stone soldiered through this second inning of work in the bottom of the ninth, working around two hits to pick up the win.
Senior right-hander Matt Hink, playing in his final nonconference game got the ball for Harvard. The Ballwin, Mo., native threw 71 pitches in a solid four innings in which he surrendered two runs, both coming in his final inning of work, and struck out one. It was the first career start for Hink, who spent his first three years on campus as a first baseman.
The River Hawks pushed their lead to three in the sixth inning after sophomore right fielder Russ Olive doubled, advanced to third on a wild pitch, and scored on a John Polichetti sac fly. The bullpen trio of Stone, junior Garrett Rupp, and freshman JT Bernard surrendered just one run in the game’s final five innings. Stone led the way with four punchouts.

The 100th time’s the charm, it turns out.
After a slow start, Harvard men’s lacrosse fought back in the second half, upsetting No. 11 Yale in the final stages of the 100th meeting of the two storied institutions.
Freshman attackman Ryan Graff scored the game-winner with 2:48 left in regulation. With the score knotted at 8-8, junior goalie Rob Shaw made a crucial stop, quickly lobbing an outlet pass to senior midfielder Sean Coleman, who was streaking down the center of the field. Coleman carried the ball to the top of the box, where he met a second Bulldog defender. The double team turned back Coleman, but the savvy tri-captain moved the ball to junior attackman Morgan Cheek. Then Cheek made the key feed to Graff, whose defender had rushed to confront Coleman and left Graff alone on the doorstep.
Yale (8-5, 5-1 Ivy) entered Saturday’s matchup 5-0 in conference play, looking for its first undefeated Ivy League campaign since 1957.
For the majority of the first half, it looked as if Yale would attain that feat. The Bulldogs had amassed a 4-0 lead in the waning moments of the second quarter, but as Harvard (6-7, 2-4 Ivy) has done all season, the offense turned to Cheek. The nation’s seventh-leading point-scorer weaved through a pack of four Yalies to put the Crimson on the board with 3:43 to play in the half. Less than a minute later, junior attackman Tim Edmonds scored his first of three goals, and the Crimson entered the break down 4-2.
The Bulldogs wasted no time in jumping to a 6-2 lead 4:46 into the third quarter. The two sides then traded goals, leaving Harvard trailing 7-3 with just under six minutes to play in the quarter. And that’s where the magic began.
“We continued to urge and encourage the guys to just keep playing and stay focused in the moment—keep playing one play at a time and not play the scoreboard,” Wojcik said. “The team showed a tremendous amount of resilience, and showed a lot of resolve to keep fighting—keep battling in a game where we were down 4-0 and didn’t score our first goal until the last few minutes of the first half.”
Edmonds kicked off Harvard’s run with 4:51 left in the frame. Over the next 2:31, three consecutive goals from Cheek, Edmonds, and Coleman tied the game at seven apiece after three quarters.
“We got a break, and we were able to score four goals in a row heading into the fourth,” Wojcik said. “We won a couple of faceoffs in a row, and we were able to hit our shots. We were sloppy with the ball in the first half offensively. In that third quarter, you saw us play with a little quicker tempo—just won a few faceoffs and buried our shots.”
The Bulldogs answered with a man-up goal early in the final stanza, but Harvard responded 58 seconds later. Junior midfielder Joe Lang, who was held without a point for the first time this season, dodged between defenders at the point before firing a shot that ricocheted off the left side of Yale goalie Phil Huffard and into the hands of Graff, who put home the rebound.
A back-and-forth battle ensued over the next 10:47 before Graff delivered the final blow, sealing Harvard’s improbable triumph.
Senior goalie Colin Delea started in net, stopping one shot before making way for Shaw, who went on to face a barrage. Yale eclipsed the 50-shot mark late in the fourth quarter—eventually tallying 53. The Bulldogs ultimately managed 28 shots on goal, 20 of which Shaw and Delea turned away, good for a .714 save percentage. Shaw’s performance was highlighted by an eight-save fourth quarter, in which the Harvard defense held Yale scoreless over the final 14:33 of play.
“First off, what really got us going was senior Colin Delea,” Wojcik said. “We wanted to honor him and reward him for his hard work, his dedication, and being a great teammate over his career. So we started Colin…. Rob came in and was outstanding.”
From a statistical perspective, Yale won the game, outshooting Harvard 53-36, going 14-20 at the faceoff X, and picking up more ground balls.
But at the end of the day, the only stat that mattered was the final score. And thanks to the Crimson’s timely comeback, the seniors finished on a high note.

The Harvard track and field team has been to more prestigious meets this year than the Penn Relays, but none is larger in size or older in tenure than the three-day affair that took place last week. With nine Crimson athletes making the trip to the City of Brotherly Love, and several more taking to North Easton, Mass., for the Skyhawk Invitational, the team made the most of its last week of preparation before the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships.
“Penn Relays is a great opportunity to compete at a historic track meet and put down some fast times before Heps,” said junior distance runner Fiona Davis. “Thursday at Penn Relays is Distance Night where the steeple chase, 5k, and 10k are run under the lights, ending just before midnight, and it is the perfect time to run a fast 10k to get onto the Heps roster. Sophomore Collin Price had a breakthrough race running his first 10k in 30:08, earning him a spot on the Heps roster and putting him in a great position to score.”
SKYHAWK INVITATIONAL
Traveling less than an hour away, several student athletes stayed within state lines to compete in the Skyhawk Invitational hosted by Stonehill College. Among them, three left the meet with gold medals and another with a bronze.
Leading off for the group was the lone field competitor, sophomore Andrew Bolze in the long jump competition. After the first round, Bolze was in second with a jump of 6.83 meters to junior Josh Hubbell of Stonehill at 6.86. Both fouled the next jump, and Bolze the one after that. Still down heading into the fourth round of jumps, the Harvard sophomore landed a clean attempt but came up short to Hubbell.
At this point, another junior from Stonehill, Mark Hamalian, had entered contention with a 6.82-meter jump, only 0.1 behind Bolze. In his fifth round jump, however, the sophomore was explosive, landing a personal-record jump of 6.96 meters and securing the gold medal for the Crimson.
Following that performance were strong outings by two of the hurdling teams. In the 110-meter hurdles, sophomore Mitch Valko earned another gold for Harvard. In Valko’s inaugural race in the 110’s for the spring outdoor season, the sophomore outpaced his competitors with a time of 15.01 seconds.
Running the longer variant, the 400-meter hurdles, were freshman Will Rienas and junior Randall Raymond. The duo took home first and third, respectively. Rienas crossed the finish line in 56.20 seconds and Raymond was less than a second behind at 56.66 seconds. Between the classmates was Atiba McLaren, a freshman from Stonehill,
Ultimately, with not as many racers as the opposing teams, the Crimson finished eighth as a squad in the team rankings.
PENN RELAYS
Competing in the same meet as children, high school students, and Olympic athletes, although in different divisions, the Harvard track and field team took the Franklin Field in Philadelphia for the 123rd rendition of the historic Penn Relays.
Taking fifth place in last week’s Cardinal Classic at Stanford, junior pole vaulter Marlena Sabatino was more than prepared for her field of competitors. On her first jump of the day, Sabatino exceeded the 3.80-meter bar and maintained the lead for the rest of the jumps. Leaving the meet with a gold, the junior’s closest Ancient Eight competitor was Nicole Macco of Penn, who placed third. In fact, Penn was the only other Ivy League school that participated in the pole vault competition.
The 10,000 meter runners had a good day as well, particularly the men. Leading the group was sophomore Collin Price in his first ever time to run the race. The sophomore claimed fifth of the pool with a time of 30:08.91.
“I've been asking my coach to put me in a 10k for a while and have been primarily focusing on running that event,” Price said. “Most of my training has been geared towards a longer race. I was definitely very excited to run in the low thirties, especially since it was my first time running the 10k.”
Finishing behind Price was teammate and junior Tyler Spear. Clocking in at 32:13.49, Spear finished the race in 22nd. On the women’s side of the event, Davis was the lone racer and finished in 16th place with a time of 37:09.96 seconds.
The meet represented the final chance to practice for the two teams as they head into arguably the most important meet of the season, the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships. The Heps will pit all Ivy League teams against each other at Yale next weekend as they compete for an opportunity to extend their seasons.
“I'm feeling pretty good about where that puts me for Heps, as I believe that time puts me at fifth in the Ivy League this season,” Price said. “The goal will definitely to be to score some points for the team."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team qualified for the Ivy League Tournament for the fourth time in as many years.
However, the Crimson did not find its way back into the conference tournament the way it would have liked. After opening its Ancient Eight campaign with three consecutive wins, Harvard picked up only a single victory in its final four league contests.
The Crimson’s most recent Ivy League loss came in Ithaca, N.Y., on Saturday, as the team took on No. 11 Cornell, its second straight nationally-ranked conference opponent. In a battle between Harvard’s top-25 offensive unit and the Big Red’s defense, which is ranked eighth in the nation, Cornell’s back line came out on top. The Crimson (8-7, 4-3 Ivy League) was held to its second-lowest single-game goals total of the season, while the Big Red (11-4, 6-1 Ivy) was able to cruise to a 13-6 win.
Despite the result, Harvard ended the campaign in fourth place in the Ancient Eight. The top-half finish means that the Crimson’s season will continue with a conference tournament semifinal next week.
““We played below our potential,” senior attacker Marisa Romeo said. “Luckily we have the tournament next week to play hard.”
Look for the team to focus on avoiding foul trouble in its upcoming tournament game. Harvard has committed 178 infractions to its opponents’ 136 over its last five games and leads the Ivy League in fouls per game. On Saturday, the Crimson registered 13 more fouls than Cornell, racking up 41 over the course of the matchup.
The Big Red made Harvard pay for those fouls, scoring five times directly from free position chances and netting two more goals off free position passes.
Four of Cornell’s penalty scores came in the first half, helping the Big Red to a five-point advantage by halftime.
Cornell jumped out to its lead quickly. The Big Red drew first blood, finding the back of the net less than two minutes into the game. Although junior midfielder Julia Glynn pulled the Crimson level with her 16th finish of the season a minute later, Cornell notched five unanswered goals, amassing a 6-1 lead by the 20 minute mark in the first period.
Harvard got two points back through a free position conversion from Romeo and a close-range finish from freshman midfielder Katie Muldoon, but the Big Red answered each Crimson score with one of its own to finish the first stanza ahead, 8-3.
The game marked one of just three times this season that Romeo, who is ranked 11th in the country for points per game, has been held to a single point. The senior fired off five shots on goal, but an outstanding performance from Cornell senior goalie Renee Poullott all but shut Romeo down.
Poullott tallied 15 saves throughout the game, four more than Harvard’s dual effort of juniors Meredith Brown and Olivia Gundrum mustered.
The Big Red also topped the Crimson in turnovers, ground balls, and clear percentage in a stifling defensive showing.
Cornell’s offense also shone on the day, led by standout performances from co-captains Catherine Ellis and Kristy Gilbert. Ellis racked up five goals and an assist, while Gilbert accrued four scores and a helper. All of Gilbert’s finishes came from free position opportunities, as did one from Ellis.
Harvard could find no answer to the Big Red’s potent attacking duo. Glynn and Muldoon would each net another goal in the second half, but the team’s top two scorers, Romeo and sophomore midfielder Keeley MacAfee, were each limited to a goal apiece.
Glynn, MacAfee, and Muldoon did all of the Crimson’s scoring in the second half with a finish each, but Harvard could not break through Cornell’s defense until nearly halfway through the closing stanza.
Glynn picked up the Crimson’s first goal after the restart 14 minutes into the second period, when tri-captain attacker Maeve McMahon passed the ball away on a free position chance. Glynn fooled a Big Red defender with a shot fake before picking out the far side of the net to complete her brace.
By that point, though, Cornell had already scored three times, including a pair of free position conversions in three minutes from Gilbert.
With the result already out of reach, the teams would trade goals for the rest of the contest. First, MacAfee outpaced a defender with a roll dodge and netted her 35th finish of the season with five minutes remaining after a Big Red score.
Ellis picked up her fifth and final goal less than a minute after MacAfee, and Muldoon closed out the game with a score with just over 60 seconds left to play. Sophomore midfielder Caroline Garrity had her shot turned away, but Poullott couldn’t hold on to the ball, and Muldoon picked up the rebound and tucked it away from close range to settle the margin at 13-6.
Harvard will get a shot at redemption when it faces Cornell in the Ivy League Tournament semifinal.
“We played a talented team and we can't wait to play them again on Friday,” McMahon said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ahead of the final four games of the season against Dartmouth, Harvard trailed the Big Green by one game in the Ivy League North Division standings. This exact situation was nothing new for the Crimson.
In 2016, Harvard softball took three of four games in a home-and-home series with Dartmouth, clinching the North Division and earning a berth in the Ivy League Championship Series.
In 2017, however, the Crimson needed only three games to get the job done. With an 8-4 victory in the first game of Sunday’s doubleheader, Harvard booked its trip to Princeton, N.J. to take on the Tigers in the best-of-three playoff series.
“We’ve overcome a lot of things this year,” head coach Jenny Allard said. “I was really proud of their grit. They stayed the course. We’ve had some people really step up when we had some key injuries.”
All told, the Crimson (22-17, 13-7 Ivy) closed out its season at home with a four-game sweep of the Big Green (11-28-1, 10-10), outscoring the Big Green by a combined tally of 32-12.
Home runs were key for Harvard’s offense this weekend. The team hit nine of its 19 total homers in these four games alone.
“It was finally nice to see them swing with a lot of confidence,” Allard said. “I think it was just a confidence that we could square the ball up.”
HARVARD 8, DARTMOUTH 0 (5 INNINGS)
Seven runs in the bottom of the second and masterful pitching from the freshmen duo of Olivia Giaquinto and Alissa Hiener was all the Crimson needed to shut out Dartmouth in its final regular season game.
Following the seven-run outburst early on, the game was won on a walk-off home run in the bottom of the fifth, as a solo blast off the bat of freshman second baseman Isabelle Haugh gave Harvard an eight-run advantage. The team streamed out of the dugout to meet Haugh at home plate after the first home run of her career.
Having already clinched a spot in the Ivy League Championship Series, Allard opted for her two freshmen arms to handle the pitching duties in the final game.
“It was great just to see two freshmen going out there and doing their job and really stepping up for the team,” said junior right fielder Maddy Kaplan. “It was awesome because we need everyone to win the championship.”
Giaquinto made her fourth start of the season in the circle and fired four shutout innings, allowing only three hits and one walk. Returning from injury, Hiener made her collegiate debut in relief in the top of the fifth. The freshman stranded runners on first and second to preserve the shutout.
“We wanted to get Alissa out there,” Allard said. “She’s come back from a major injury. She’s worked hard to get herself back, and she did a great job for us.”
The bottom of the second was a wild inning for the Crimson offense. Two doubles, seven singles, a stolen base, and an error all contributed to seven Harvard runners crossing home plate in the frame. Between co-captain Giana Panariello and Giaquinto, the Crimson strung together six consecutive hits at one point in the inning.
HARVARD 8, DARTMOUTH 4
Harvard clinched its Ivy League playoff spot with a come-from-behind 8-4 win at home.
“We’re excited to extend our season, play another week with our seniors, and we’re determined to go out there and do our best with another shot at Princeton,” Kaplan said.
Down 2-0 entering the bottom of the fourth, the Crimson rallied for four runs on back-to-back long balls from Giaquinto and sophomore catcher Elizabeth Shively.
The following inning was more of the same for Harvard, as Giaquinto hit her second three-run home run in as many innings. The two home runs bumped Giaquinto’s season total to six, tied for the team lead with sophomore third baseman Erin Lockhart. All told, the freshman hit three long balls in four weekend games, each of them driving in three runs.
Leaving runners on base ended up being crucial for the Crimson’s pitching staff in this contest. Despite allowing a whopping 14 hits, sophomore Katie Duncan and senior Taylor Cabe stranded 13 Big Green and in the process held the visitors to four runs.
Harvard scored its eighth and final run of the day on an RBI single by sophomore shortstop Rhianna Rich in the bottom of the sixth. Rich, Giaquinto, and Shively finished with two hits apiece.
HARVARD 9, DARTMOUTH 2
The Crimson’s second and final game in Hanover, N.H. was not nearly as hotly contested as the first, as Harvard coasted to a 9-2 victory.
Immediately after closing out Dartmouth in the opening game, Cabe was back in the circle, this time getting the nod as the starter. Unhindered by her 28-pitch save, Cabe tossed 117 more to record her third complete-game win of the season.
The Boiling Springs, S.C. native scattered eight hits and struck out five in her seventh win of the season, improving her record to 7-7.
Home runs continued to be a theme in the second contest of the weekend. One of Cabe’s two runs allowed came via the long ball, and senior Catherine Callaway, Kaplan, and Lockhart all went deep for the Crimson.
For the second straight game, Lockhart homered in the fifth inning. Her three-run blast was part of a five-run outburst after four innings without any run production from either side.
Big Green junior backstop Claire Bird countered with a solo shot of her own in the home half of the fifth. However, Harvard opened the floodgates in the top of the seventh to put the game out of reach for Dartmouth. Callaway and Kaplan both went yard off Dartmouth reliever Tessa Grossman.
Rich tripled twice, going 3-for-5 overall and scoring three runs. The pair of three-baggers pushed her season total to seven, which is tops in the Ivy League. The next-highest total for any player is three.
HARVARD 7, DARTMOUTH 6
Despite batting around and posting five runs on seven hits in the bottom of the seventh, the Big Green was unable to overcome the Crimson in the first game of the weekend.
Dartmouth kicked off its final trip to the plate with four straight hits. Junior center fielder Lourlin Lara doubled in the final run against Duncan, but she was caught stealing third base for the first out of the inning. With runners on first and second and a 7-2 lead, Cabe replaced Duncan in the circle.
The Big Green continued to put the bat on the ball, sandwiching an RBI groundout between two singles to cut its deficit to two runs. A hit batter and yet another single put the tying run on third and the winning run on first with junior left fielder Tiffany Dyson due up. However, Cabe buckled down, striking Dyson out to kill the rally and earn her second save of the season.
The Crimson avoided defeat due to a plethora of insurance runs scored throughout the game. In the top of the fourth, Giaquinto spoiled Dartmouth’s shutout bid by blasting a three-run home run to left field. The homer was the Falls Church, Va. native’s fourth of the season.
In the top of the fifth, Harvard continued to benefit from the long ball. Lockhart, the Crimson’s biggest power threat, broke a nine-game home run drought by taking Dartmouth starter Breanna Ethridge deep to extend the lead to five runs.
While homers fueled Harvard’s attack early on, the Crimson manufactured its final two runs in the top of the seventh with patience at the plate. A whopping four walks and an RBI single from junior designated player Melissa Lacro plated two, enough to help Harvard fend off Dartmouth in its half of the seventh.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Traveling to Bloomington, Indiana, the Harvard women’s water polo team finished off a strong season with a fourth-place finish in the CWPA Championship Tournament, the Crimson’s highest mark in almost 20 years.
The highlight of the weekend was No. 20 Harvard’s (15-14, 4-4 CWPA) 12-11 comeback win over No. 16 Indiana on Friday night in front of a boisterous crowd. On Saturday, Harvard fell 11-5 to first-seeded No. 7 Michigan and finished with a 10-7 loss against No. 15 Hartwick in the third-place game.
“We were bummed that we weren't able to come out with a few more wins, but 4th place is the best finish in Harvard women's water polo history,” sophomore Kristin Hong said. “We've been able to break down a lot of barriers this season, and we are excited for the future.”
No. 20 HARVARD 12, No. 16 INDIANA 11
Coming out to fast start, Indiana (21-10, 5-3) jumped out to a 1-0 lead in the first minute of play. Harvard senior Zoe Osborne quickly answered the goal to tie the score off a feed from fellow senior Michelle Martinelli. However, Harvard lost momentum, and Indiana rebounded to score four consecutive goals to finish out the first quarter.
In the second quarter, Harvard held Indiana scoreless, and freshman Mathilde Ribordy found the net with seven minutes left in the half to close the game to a three-point deficit. In the opening 90 seconds of the second half, Harvard scored three times, twice in under a minute by Hong.
“Kristen Hong’s two really quick goals in the third quarter to get us up when we were [down] 5-2 were key,” Coach Ted Minnis said. “And the floodgates opened after that.”
Throughout the second half, six other Harvard players scored in addition to Hong’s four goals. Freshman Sofia Carrera-Justiz scored the tide-turning goal, helping Harvard take its first lead of the game. With goals from Osborne, Ribordy, junior Sami Strutner and Martinelli, Harvard kept a two-point lead, finishing the quarter with a score of 10-8.
In the final period, Indiana scored first, closing the gap to a one-point game. With just over five minutes left in the game, freshman Julie Harrison responded with a goal, but the two-point lead was short-lived, and Indiana tied the game 11-11 with 3:35 to go.
Hong pulled through with her fourth goal of the game with 2:23 on the clock, putting Harvard back on top at 12-11. Junior Cleo Harrington held strong against Indiana’s final attempts, giving Harvard the win and helping the team advance to the semifinals of the CWPA Championships.
No. 7 MICHIGAN 11, No. 20 HARVARD 5
On Saturday, Harvard played top-seeded Michigan (28-8, 8-0) in the semifinals but was unable to upset the Wolverines. Harvard struggle to score in the first half against Michigan with sophomore Haley Bowe scoring Harvard’s lone goal of the first two periods, resulting in a 4-1 score at the intermission.
In the second half, Martinelli’s hat trick and a goal from Ribordy helped Harvard close the gap at times, but Michigan held strong and finished with an 11-5 victory.
No. 15 HARTWICK 10, No. 20 HARVARD 7
In the third-place game of the CWPA Championships, Harvard fought hard against Hartwick (24-10, 6-2) but was unable to stop the Hawks from pulling away and earning a 10-7 victory.
In the first eight minutes of the game, goals from Harvard seniors Martinelli and Eela Nagaraj kept the score tied at 2-2. However, Hartwick scored twice early in the second quarter and then three-straight goals late in the quarter, to end the first half with a 7-4 lead at the intermission.
Ribordy opened the second half with an early goal, closing the deficit to two points. Martinelli finished the third quarter with a goal, and Osborne scored another for Harvard in the first possession of the fourth quarter, making a late game comeback seem possible. However, Hartwick regained possession and finished the game with a 3-0 run to defeat Harvard 10-7.
