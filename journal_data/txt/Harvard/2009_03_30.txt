Burning boats on Housing Night may not be one of Harvard’s most historic traditions, but try telling that to the scores of freshmen who experienced a police crackdown in the recent Housing Day “Quad boat incident.”For several years, freshmen students have trudged to the Charles River to light small boats on fire on the eve of Housing Day in hope of securing a desired House placement. This year, however, Cambridge and Harvard police aggressively shut down the ritual. Several boats of more outlandish construction may have merited intervention, but the overall crackdown carried out by HUPD was excessive. It seems incredible that a few flimsy craft, doomed to sail a few feet and then crumple in flames, posed a real safety threat. Obviously, students cannot be allowed to endanger themselves and others with reckless behavior, but a degree of trust must be maintained between authorities and those whom they protect. We fail to see the pressing danger of the popular boat release commensurate with the enthusiasm of the police response.HUPD plays a key role in the lives of all Harvard students, maintaining their safety and peace of mind. Yet, as a college police force, discretion should be the crux of policy. HUPD is, after all, looking after the students. We recognize its efforts to protect the community from without, but HUPD could perhaps show more common sense in policing students from within. Strictly monitoring Housing Night does not seem the best allocation of resources.The tradition of the Quad boats is young, but this does not discount its importance to the student body. All traditions are fresh and new at some point; for all its history, Harvard should embrace new traditions along with the old. Random housing is itself a recent innovation, so it stands to reason that traditions related to the moment of random selection are young. The Quad boat tradition’s popularity helps encourage a sense of community among freshmen and the greater undergraduate community. The university, with so many cogs to keep functioning, can at times seem more concerned with minutiae and protocol than with undergraduate welfare. We urge the university to look kindly upon such student-driven institutions instead of casting them down.At the same time, students must be reasonable themselves with their constructions. The birth of any tradition comes with growing pains and the codification of what is considered acceptable or excessive. The boats that prompted HUPD’s initial response this year probably went too far, but this lesson should be passed down. Quad boats, and the sentiment behind them, should continue as a tradition.

With 60 million adults falling under its label, obesity has reached crisis levels in the United States. Perhaps most alarmingly, 12.5 million children are overweight, putting them at an increased risk for a host of diseases in adulthood, including diabetes, coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, and certain forms of cancer. These risks do not affect personal health alone—the costs of obesity to the U.S. economy have been estimated at over a hundred billion dollars.
Clearly, while raising awareness and educating the public is important, a much more targeted policy is necessary to effectively combat childhood obesity. Radical as it may sound, the government should consider implementing a law that prohibits fast-food restaurants around public schools.
A recent study from the National Bureau of Economic Research provides promising data to back up such a policy change. Conducted by economists at the University of California and Columbia University, the decade-long study found that high-school freshmen who attended school within a block of fast-food restaurants were markedly more likely to be obese than those whose schools were farther away when adjusted for variables like income and race. Similar results applied when researchers tracked obesity rates before and after the opening of a new fast-food outlet in the area.
Such a study appears to suggest at least one promising avenue of confronting youth obesity—changing zoning laws to prevent fast-food restaurants from opening near schools. By reducing access to unhealthful foods, schools can at least promote nutritious choices during school hours. Indeed, there is precedent within schools themselves, where soft drinks have often been eliminated from vending machines and more healthful options have been introduced in the school cafeterias. 
Naturally, this proposal would not meet with universal approval, especially since students are not the only customers to whom these restaurants cater. Restaurateurs argue that such a policy would be unfair and harm the local economy by pushing out profitable business. Lawmakers, however, must adopt a longer-term view. In 2000, the cost of treating diseases resulting from obesity—measured in insurance costs, Medicare, and Medicaid—came to the grand sum of $117 billion. These are costs that come back to affect all Americans in the form of rising insurance premiums and a struggling health-care system and are enough to outweigh short-term business profit.
Certainly, merely eliminating fast-food restaurants around schools is not enough—education about healthful eating habits and exercise is absolutely critical in reducing obesity rates among youth in the United States. But removing combo meals from daily lunches is certainly a step in the right direction. Several surgeons general in the last century took an aggressive stance on smoking; obesity is a similar major public health hazard and thus deserves a similar treatment. Helping students opt for cafeteria salads over chicken nuggets is an excellent place to start.

Harvard students hold many social events on campus, and there is a lot of competition between us to organize fun and well-attended parties. We try to make the flashiest poster and the catchiest name. Every Monday and Thursday, we compete with other student-group representatives to promote our events, hoping to make our advertisement the most iconic image on campus for the week. However, it seems that, despite all the energy spent in event publicity, we put too little thought into the kinds of images and words that we use and how they affect the entire Harvard culture. 
A recent case in point is the “Get Lucky” poster, advertising a party that was supposed to happen shortly before spring break. The image of a silhouette of a naked, curvaceous woman with a cowboy hat was shocking. We were surprised that our fellow students could portray women in such a demeaning, objectifying way. Who could this naked woman be but a party attendee, just another Harvard student? 
Furthermore, the strategically placed shamrock, serving as a target, left no question as to what “Get Lucky” really means. In order to make their advertisements for this party noticeable, the students who made the poster (and many others of all genders) have unintentionally crossed the line from objectification to using images and phrases that may encourage, normalize, and undermine the seriousness of sexual violence. This trend begs the questions: How can it be acceptable to use this kind of imagery? What are we saying about how we view and value each other?
The “Get Lucky” poster is merely a symptom of an endemic problem. Other publicity materials recently seen around campus include boasts about “dead hookers” as a sign of a House’s appeal, not-so-subtle references to oral sex as a form of humiliation, and casual use of oft-derogatory terms like “whore” and “pussy.” It has become normal practice for student organizations and House Committees to use images and language that objectify women as sexual objects in order to promote their social events and groups. 
While the Radcliffe Union of Students is a sex-positive organization partially devoted to disseminating information about female sexuality, we find it troubling that the campus climate of late seems to include normalization of female objectification. Because objectification of potential sex partners (often women) is often a prerequisite for sexual violence, imagery and phrasing that objectify women contribute to a culture in which rape and other forms of sexual assault are accepted. In addition, people who have already experienced sexual violence may be triggered or particularly disturbed by thoughtless, insensitive publicity materials.
Student leaders who are planning such publicity as well as student group advisers and administrators should think about the kinds of messages they transmit about their parties and organizations. While most have good intentions, there should be greater consideration for the gendered expectations that are created as well as the general culture of accepted practices and ways of treating each other that the use of such images and phrases promotes. The ways in which we portray one another and our ideals of “man” or “woman” are set not only in the context of Harvard but also in a larger world that too often objectifies and disempowers women without their consent. A little thought would go a long way toward avoiding contributing to this unfortunate reality. 
Students, administrators, and all members of the Harvard community should be more aware of the messages that we send in our publicity materials. We all should live up to the responsibilities that we bear, both to our fellow students and as representatives of the Harvard name. There is no excuse for us to exploit any body’s image in this way.

Traditional American newspapers will die—none too fast for the next generation of information proprietors. From the once high-flying Tribunes, Posts, and Chronicles to the galactic Suns and Stars, iconic Inquirers, and relatively quotidian Timeses and Newses, newspapers around the country are heavily scaling back, folding, or borrowing from tycoons foreign and domestic.
No one would bat an eye for these victims of the marketplace, of course, were it not for their perceived importance in the healthy functioning of American civic life. This reputation, couched in the irreproachable quotations of Founding Fathers from Thomas Jefferson to Benjamin Franklin, has directly led to desperate calls by otherwise cool-headed individuals to save a business model that successfully marketed itself as the sole producer of reliable truth in an otherwise highly competitive and vibrant economy.
A recent op-ed in The New York Times by Yale chief investment officer David Swensen and his associate Michael Schmidt encouraged turning newspapers into “nonprofit, endowed institutions—like colleges and universities… [to enhance] autonomy while shielding them from the economic forces that are now tearing them down.” This is incredibly foolish, not to mention expensive: The last thing we need populating the news business is hundreds of lumbering, immortal white elephants sucking the talent out of the business of economically reporting news. Most damagingly, newspaper bailouts, endowments, and other artificial life support would crowd out human capital from being invested efficiently in modern journalism. It is time to come to grips with the death of the newspaper and educate ourselves in distilling truth and analysis from the sundry other news media that populate modern life.
The fourth estate—and its newspaper wing in particular—is no priesthood of truth tellers. Scandals at the most venerable broadsheets are regular enough to set your clock by, and the printing of Friday night football scores in every hamlet across the land is in no guise the highest form of civic duty. The newspaper industry certainly was, however, one of the plumpest cash cows in the landscape of American business for numerous decades. As local newspapers survived on classified advertising, the economics of the industry invariably led to a monopoly paper emerging in literally every local market as the strong got stronger. Warren Buffett compared owning the resulting enterprise to owning slot machines.
Now, these positions have been eroded as advertisers find more efficient distribution mechanisms, and the cash cows have arrived at the stockyard, burdened with all the inefficiencies that usually plague the once-plump. Newspaper dynasties, as aristocratic a lot as can be found on this continent, extracted generous dividends for generations and set up dual-class shareholding structures that let them enjoy all the trappings of press barony without the requisite skin in the game. Let us eulogize them respectfully and free up journalistic talent for sustainable models of news creation.
In the future, information will be more valuable than ever. Knowledge and technology are the new capital and labor of the American economy. I have no doubt that there are phenomenal profits to be made in the information industry. The relentless losses of newspapers are undoubtedly testament to their almost unique ineptitude in catering to the needs of the modern citizen or business. The richest man in New York—Michael Bloomberg—is not a Wall Streeter, but tellingly a man who sold news and information to Wall Street, despite the highly entrenched business media that already existed. The two 35-year-olds who run Google—the largest distributor of advertising in the world—own a business that aims to do nothing less than “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” It can be tremendously profitable to be a creator of content—even of costly content (think: Pixar).
There is no reason, whether out of nostalgia or fear of change, why newspapers should bear anything less than the full court press that Internet news outlets, search engines, and other new competitors are able to apply. The future of reporting the news appears in all likelihood to be an exciting and modern tale, complete with a rich vocabulary teeming with the neologisms of a new age: Blogs, wikis, feeds, and tweets come readily to mind.
This destruction and rebirth in the news business is not the tragic passing of a golden era, the frightening end of high-quality journalistic output, or the downright terrifying onset of an epoch of public corruption unchecked by an active press. The talent that enters the industry will be the very same; their desire to build reputation and trust will continue. Their principles and standards of conduct, never perfect and always human, will carry over into the new economy. Even the customers of the news—citizens desirous of being well informed or requiring certain information—will stay constant. Only the format will change. To the young people who discover those formats: Cheers!—you earned it. To the Gazettes, Heralds, and Registers who could not keep up and are assuredly not playing Monopoly anymore: Do not collect $200 as you pass Go.

Although the hedge-fund industry has long relished the light touch of lawmakers and financial regulators, a new era is dawning for largely unregulated financial institutions, and rightly so. The huge systemic risks associated with hedge funds and other unregulated firms in the financial system have a ruinous potential in our economy. Yet these bodies have been allowed to operate with a minimal level of oversight for years.  Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner’s call for an expansion of financial regulation and increased transparency faces a long struggle through Congress but will prove a crucial framework for promoting future economic stability.Mangers at hedge funds and other unregulated market players are often reluctant to open their bets to scrutiny or reveal their positions in the market because doing so allows competitors to mirror trades and dilute profits. Many also view the paperwork and bureaucracy associated with tight regulations as time-consuming and expensive distractions from a funds’ ultimate goal: making money.These objections to oversight, however, ignore the potential damage that unregulated investing and high-risk betting can wreak. Unchecked hedge funds, unregulated derivatives traders, exotic trades, and obscure credit-default swaps all pose threats to the wider stability of the U.S. economy. Additionally, the government’s current inability to safely unwind financial institutions that pose systemic risk presents a gaping hole in federal resolution authority. Unfortunately, behaviors at hedge funds and on trading floors that pose substantial risk to all Americans have for too long been allowed to proliferate outside of the government’s gaze.Geithner’s plan to address systemic risks in financial markets is comprehensive, if still relatively non-specific. Presented to lawmakers last Thursday, the proposal outlines general changes in four areas: the limitation of broad economic risks, the enhancement of consumer and investor protections, the closure of gaps in regulatory oversight, and the global coordination of any actions that are undertaken.The most aggressive of Geithner’s reforms would establish a systemic-risk overseer—possibly the Federal Reserve—that would serve as a super-regulator in charge of making sure no firms took on too much risk. The plan would also raise capital and risk-management standards, ensuring that firms safeguard a larger proportion of their assets to protect against unexpected losses and more tightly manage their links to other financial bodies. By forcing big hedge funds to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission, thereby releasing their portfolio information, the government could determine which funds pose a threat to the economy and better regulate those funds. Geithner’s plan proposes this change as well as a more comprehensive oversight of derivatives (such as the regulation of credit-default swaps) that would be traded through a clearinghouse. Finally, endowing the government with the power to resolve large, failing financial institutions other than banks would fill the power vacuum plaguing the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as of late.Geithner’s plan is complex and still in its infant stages: Thursday’s proposal left many details up in the air so that productive exchange with lawmakers can occur in the near future. Surely, it will undergo much revision and debate as it works its way through opposition in Congress. Its principles of transparency, disclosure, centralization, and closer oversight, however, must not be lost on Capitol Hill. If executed properly and enacted swiftly, Geithner’s plan should work toward restoring market confidence and the security of American finance.

In one of his early debates with Senator John McCain, President Obama famously declared that the government needed to use a “scalpel” instead of a “hatchet” to reduce spending. The state of California, however, seems to have no problem with using a hatchet to address its current budget crisis.  As of mid-March, the government will have issued over 25,000 pink slips to teachers statewide, to the outrage of teachers, parents, and students alike.
Certainly, tough times call for tough measures, and, with layoffs a common occurrence in the private sector, it is unreasonable for the public sector to pass completely unspared. The problem is the manner in which teachers are laid off—as dictated by the California Education Code, teachers are fired based on seniority, so that the last hired are the first to go. This system of indiscriminately cutting from the bottom up means that schools are likely to lose many of their bright, young, and energetic teachers, to the detriment of their students.
In no other profession would it be considered acceptable to fire employees solely for being new at the job or exploring time off, regardless of their job performance. Indeed, research consistently reaffirms the strong connection between teacher quality and student achievement; schools cannot afford to lose effective teachers because of seniority rules. Moreover, because teacher pay is also related to seniority—and recent hires have the lowest salaries—cutting only the newest hires means that school districts must lay off more teachers in order to balance their budgets, further straining school resources and driving up class sizes.
Unfortunately, seniority-based layoff policies in the teaching profession—set by law or contract in most states and heavily backed by teacher’s associations—are common but flawed practices. Those fired are most often young teachers who have missed out on tenure opportunities. Experienced teachers who take time off to pursue other projects are also penalized by the system because they lose seniority when they leave a school district. At a time when the president is calling on more Americans to enter the teaching profession, this apparent dispensability is extremely demoralizing; it makes little sense to discourage new teachers by putting them in such a precarious position.
How to explain this bizarre reasoning, then? The explanation is largely political. Teachers’ unions stick to seniority-based layoff policies because they prioritize job protection, even above student welfare. Teachers should be given the privilege of staying power, however, due to merit, not merely the length of time worked. School districts should certainly make every effort to retain good teachers that have worked for many years, but, if cuts need to be made, they should focus on letting go ineffective teachers instead of simply targeting new ones. If layoffs must be made, they should be done so based on a combination of seniority, years of teaching experience, and performance evaluation. Researchers have suggested a combination of “student-assessment data and principal evaluations” to assess effectiveness in the classroom and make cuts accordingly.
Understandably, many teachers and teachers unions are wary of performance-based evaluations because of disagreement over what constitutes a fair way of measuring teacher effectiveness. But making decisions about matters like salaries and layoffs based on a nuanced teacher evaluation system is far fairer than merely looking at the number of years a teacher has logged at one school district.
In a speech made to the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce on March 10, Obama declared that “America’s future depends on its teachers.” Reforming teacher layoff procedures will help ensure that, even in a down economy in which hard choices must be made, good teachers stay in the classroom, where they can continue with the invaluable task of educating our youngest citizens.

Two Fridays ago, I was at Logan Airport, waiting to catch a flight to New York for a job interview. When I asked the company’s human-resources representative if I should take the Acela train to New York, she laughed, told me I would never get to the office in time for the interview, and booked me a ticket on the Delta shuttle. I saw her point—the “high-speed” Acela can only travel an average of 85 miles per hour. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, a close friend of mine from high school was landing at Shanghai Pudong Airport for his semester abroad. He bought a ticket for the brand-new Maglev train from Pudong to the center of the city, covering a distance of twenty miles in seven minutes. 
This tale of two trips showcases America’s need for high-speed train transportation. Japan, France, Germany, and Spain have had extensive high-speed rail systems for decades, recognizing that they provide a convenient, efficient, and environmentally friendly form of transportation. It is time that we follow their lead.
High-speed trains, true to their name, are fast. They travel over 150 miles per hour, which is about three times faster than a car on a highway. When you factor in traffic, travel by car is even slower in comparison. They are also faster than air travel for distances of less than 500 miles—though airplanes can reach higher speeds, flight check-in, interminable security lines, and inevitable delays make train travel a speedier option. 
High-speed trains also drop passengers off at downtown stations, while airports are usually built on the outskirts of cities. Train travel thus eliminates the need for a cab ride into the city, saving time and reducing traffic. It took me about three hours to go from Harvard Square to Midtown Manhattan; a bullet train would have cut my travel time in half.
Greater concern for the environment and climate has created a need for greener transportation that has so far gone unfilled. High-speed rail fits the bill; according to Popular Mechanics, high-speed trains emit, on average, 40 percent less carbon per passenger-mile compared to cars and 55 percent less carbon compared to jets. The popularity of trains in Japan and Europe has taken millions of cars off the roads. The result is less congestion and less air pollution.
President Obama has recognized the role transportation projects can play in revitalizing the economy. His recent stimulus package wisely includes $8 billion for the construction and repair of rail infrastructure. High-speed rail projects create an immediate economic benefit as well as a long-term one. Initially, the construction of new rail lines and the ancillary demand for steel and concrete will create thousands of jobs. 
Once operational, the trains will facilitate long-distance commuting, putting urban jobs in reach of exurban and small-town workers. Faster travel will encourage companies to relocate further outside of major cities, where real estate is cheaper and tax incentives are more forthcoming. This would be especially useful for revitalizing regions that are hemorrhaging manufacturing jobs, like the Upper Midwest and upstate New York. Funding for rail projects should be considered an investment in America’s long-term economic robustness.
Of course, even if high-speed rail were to become a popular mode of transportation in the United States, there would still be significant demand for car and airplane travel. Nevertheless, high-speed trains would relieve airport and highway congestion by providing a competitive alternative mode of transportation. Fewer cars on the road means less traffic for those who choose to drive. Airlines will offer far fewer short-haul flights, which reduces the number of delays and frees up runway space for the long-distance flights that train travel cannot compete with. Best of all, a shift toward rail travel eliminates some of the massive and costly expansion of highways and airports that will be needed in the not-so-distant future if current trends in transportation continue.
Over the coming years, America will expand and replace its aging transportation infrastructure. Including high-speed trains in this equation will shorten travel time and be a boon to long-term economic growth and the environment. If we are wise enough to embrace high-speed rail, foreign tourists will one day travel through this country and feel the same sense of wonderment that my friend did on his first day in Shanghai.

The cover of Rolling Stone has afforded the means for countless pop-culture princesses to bridge the virgin-whore divide and construct new identities as promiscuous sex symbols. Take the 1999 cover of Britney Spears: Clad in a black push-up bra and polka-dotted panties, her lips suggestively apart and her right index finger gesturing toward her privates, the singer exudes mature sexuality; at the same time, her male companion—a stuffed Tinky-Winky—and her ostensible engagement in frivolous girl-talk affirm her status as an adolescent rendered sexually unattainable by both law and taboo. The magazine’s most recent cover relishes its role as an extreme-makeover guru, peddling a sort of sexual plastic surgery. Pushing their Gossip Girl personas’ decided lack of naiveté to a new extreme, Blake Lively and Leighton Meester jointly lick a cone topped with two scoops of ice cream in an unapologetic allude to the phallic. Blake’s innocent “come-hither” gaze and her prominent cleavage combine with the child-like sweetness of the strawberry-ice-cream-cone-turned-sex-organ to create an image that, while explicitly sexual, remains frustratingly ambivalent—caught somewhere within the fantasy of defiling virginity, the allure of girl-on-girl action, and the magnetism of the sexually mature woman.
These images fuel the flames of modern-day sexual politics: the ongoing struggle to demarcate acceptable sexuality and “sexiness” from impermissible vulgarity and “sexism.” Here, the feminist sexual libertarians, who hold that woman’s empowerment hinges on her ability to both express and claim her sexuality as she sees fit, confront the so-called radical feminists, who deny the possibility of female empowerment through sexuality, as this term is constituted within a patriarchal culture where what is sexual is what gives men pleasure. The former would applaud Rolling Stone’s cover girls for assuming control over their own bodies and asserting their freedom to be sexual. The latter would lambaste the images for reducing women’s bodies to sex objects and for commercializing female sexuality to satisfy the demands of the male consumer. 
The disagreement between the two camps reflects the contradictions inherent in contemporary Western feminism. Grounded in Simone de Beauvoir’s notion of “becoming women,” today’s feminists maintain that being a woman is not a natural consequence of having a female-sexed biological body; rather, a person becomes a “woman” through assimilation into a socially constructed category defined in opposition to “man.” Yet the ambiguity of the verb “becoming” invites both passive and active interpretations of Beauvior’s concept. Passively construed, the phrase contends that a person is made into a woman by social forces beyond her control; coerced into compliance with norms of femininity that she has not chosen, a woman, in expressing her sexuality, is merely reifying the oppressive social constraints imposed on her. Actively construed, the phrase implies that women can consciously engage in the formation of their identities, insofar as they can choose to either comply with or resist prevailing gender practices. In this vein, by encouraging women to appropriate their sexuality for their own self-defined and freely chosen ends, the feminist sexual libertarians have attempted to invert the hegemonic norms that place sex fully under male control. 
The logical and philosophical viability of both interpretations poses the most profound problem facing modern feminists. If women can derive both degradation and empowerment from public expressions of sexuality, can feminists ever agree on how to evaluate representations ranging from Blake and Leighton’s relatively subdued ice-cream fellatio to more extreme pornographic images and films? Who has the power to define which representations are to be condemned for affirming the instrumentality of women as mere means to male satisfaction, and which are to be lauded for enhancing female autonomy? And by what objective criteria can we evaluate the righteousness of these categorizations? 
Ultimately, feminists cannot opine on the precarious line between sexy and sexism without legislating the location of that line itself and, therein, relinquishing all claims to the universality of their conclusion. Indeed, modern feminism, with its valorization of the lived experiences of women, esteems individual subjectivity too highly to provide a satisfactory answer. That is not to say that this valorization is an inherently bad, or even flawed, component of contemporary feminist thought. Women should have the right to choose the manner in which they express their sexuality, regardless of the content of their choice (unless, of course, it results in foreseeable harm to others). Likewise, they should also have the right to judge which representations enlighten and which offend their sensibilities. 
Yet the ability to make these choices and pass these judgments is not without consequences: Such conflicting ideals of feminism as rebellion, empowerment, and sexual pleasure come at the expense of alternative ideals of genuine community and sisterhood, which can only be realized through a baseline level of consensus. Yet, if these tensions are an inevitable component of the representational politics of feminism, perhaps the best that feminists can do is ensure the unencumbered expression of each ideal. In this case, feminists should accept that sexualized images in Rolling Stone and other media outlets, while certainly not neutral, are neither innately empowering nor disempowering. The prerogative to make that distinction lies only with the female subject herself.

Early in the season, Harvard baseball has struggled to combine its pitching potential with strong offensive performances in a single game. During yesterday’s doubleheader, the team found each when it mattered.Picking up against Penn (10-11, 0-4 Ivy League) at Meiklejohn Field in games rescheduled due to Sunday rain, the Crimson (4-16, 2-2) used dramatic comebacks in both contests to sweep the Quakers and even its league record. Freshman Brent Suter threw a sterling complete game to silence Penn in the day’s opener for a 6-4 win, before Harvard’s bats took over in the nightcap. Senior left fielder Matt Rogers belted two home runs, including a two-run shot in the eighth inning, to help the Crimson overcome a five-run deficit and dispatch the Quakers 15-11 in 11 innings.“I can’t say enough good things about [Rogers] right now,” captain Harry Douglas said. “He’s crushing the ball. He’s an offensive force and every time he steps up to the plate we’re really confident in him.”With the entire offense clicking and a pair of stirring victories, Harvard can breathe a bit easier after getting a foothold in the league standings.“Once you get going, everything gets a lot easier,” Rogers said. “Getting two [wins] in a row today…sets the tone for the rest of our Ivy League season.”HARVARD 15, PENN 11Down 11-10 in the ninth, sophomore Sean O’Hara came to the plate with the bases loaded and one out, looking to deliver a sweep for the Crimson. The shortstop got the job done, but a base running blunder prevented a lead change. O’Hara grounded to Penn shortstop Derek Vigoa, who knocked down the ball but had no play—at least until sophomore catcher Tyler Albright was waved around from second and easily gunned down, leaving the score knotted at 11. Two innings later, though, an RBI double by freshman Jeff Reynolds and a three-run homer from junior Dan Zailskas gave Harvard its second thrilling victory of the day.In an offensive slugfest that saw 29 hits and five balls clear the fence—four off of Crimson bats—Harvard had to climb out of a hole again due to a three-run Penn first inning against the starter Zailskas. An eight-run sixth, which chased Zailskas and battered freshman reliever Will Keuper, seemed to doom the Crimson before the late offensive eruption.“Our offense salvaged us today with long balls,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh said. “We’ve got a lot of confidence and, while we sometimes haven’t finished [games] off, we have had a good approach at the plate.”Down 11-6 in the eighth, senior Jon Roberts plated himself and Reynolds with a two-run shot to left, setting the table for a dramatic ninth inning. Penn reliever Vince Voiro failed to record an out in the frame, yielding a single to senior Taylor Meehan before Rogers stepped into the box. The left fielder capped a five-hit, five-RBI day by smashing his second home run over the left-center field wall, bringing the score to 11-10. With Voiro gone, Tom Grandieri faired no better in the relief role, yielding singles to Douglas and Albright before Reynolds sacrifice bunted. After intentionally walking Roberts to set up the double play, Grandieri almost got his wish before O’Hara’s legs and an errant throw dashed the Quakers’ hopes of a split.Through the offensive explosion, rookie Jonah Klees picked up the win with a strong outing. The freshman logged 3.2 innings of no-hit ball, allowing only a walk against 12 batters faced.HARVARD 6, PENN 4Penn jumped out to an early lead, but Suter (3-2) worked a brilliant seven-inning game to keep the Crimson in contention and notch the squad’s first Ivy League win of the season.After spotting the Quakers four runs in the first two innings, Harvard began to climb back with clutch hitting. Douglas atoned for an early error at third base with a two-out RBI single in the third and an RBI double in the sixth that capped the Crimson scoring. Sophomore Dillon O’Neill and Rogers added two runs apiece on two hits as Harvard capitalized on overmatched Penn starter Reid Terry.In addition to a consistent offensive display, Suter delivered the true gem on the mound, yielding only one earned run, while striking out six and walking none. The freshman appeared to find his control early and pounded the strike zone—throwing 76 of his 99 pitches for strikes.“[Suter has] been showing all year that he can be a really good pitcher for us,” Douglas said. “When he’s on, he’s deadly, so this start was really encouraging.”After a rocky second featuring three Harvard errors, Suter settled into a groove, scattering three hits over the final five innings—as well as engineering a timely pickoff—without allowing a runner past first base.The rookie pitcher also got some help on the defensive side, with Albright gunning down Grandieri on a steal attempt in the third and Douglas and Meehan combining to turn the game’s only double play in the bottom of the fifth.—Staff writer Max N.

It’s back to business for Harvard softball (15-7, 3-1 Ivy) as the team swept Penn (4-16-1, 1-3) in a doubleheader, winning 3-1 and 5-2 yesterday at Warren Field in Philadelphia, Pa.  Finally hitting its offensive stride just in time for the start of the Ivy season, the Crimson beat the Quakers after splitting a weekend series with Columbia, in which the team was limited to only one run in two games.  But the bats were on fire for Harvard yesterday—the team scored eight runs on 19 hits to overpower its Penn counterparts.“It feels really good to have a winning record after our first weekend out,” co-captain Hayley Bock said yesterday. “We were pretty motivated to come out against Penn after splitting with Columbia—that was really disappointing. Today’s wins were really key for our season.”“It was really important for us to sweep these two games,” co-captain Bailey Vertovez said. “We had no doubt in our minds that we were going to win both of these games. We set out to prove to Penn that we were the better team and we did it.”HARVARD 5, PENN 2The Crimson seized the lead early and never looked back, scoring consistently throughout the game to build on its advantage.  “We kept scoring each inning,” freshman first baseman Whitney Shaw said. “We didn’t have one standout inning but we kept the pressure on the entire game.”Sophomore outfielder Emily Henderson got Harvard’s action started in the second inning when she came home on a wild pitch by Quakers pitcher Emily Denstedt. Sophomore Ellen Macadam scored just moments later to end the inning with a 2-0 advantage for the Crimson.  Though Penn managed to score in the fourth inning, Harvard increased its lead in the final two innings.Pinch running for junior third baseman Melissa Schellberg, who is also a Crimson Sports Editor, junior Margaux Black was able to score off of junior outfielder Jen Francis’ double later in the frame. “Jen Francis had the biggest hits of the day in the second game,” Bock said.  Henderson scored again, along with junior outfielder Stephanie Krysiak, who is also a Crimson Sports Editor, to put Harvard up 5-1 in the final inning.  But in the bottom of the seventh, Penn threatened to derail the Crimson’s lead.  With two outs, the Quakers had the bases loaded, but Vertovez, who pitched the final two frames, and the Harvard defense held fast to shut Penn down and win 5-2.“It was a close call in the seventh inning but we were able to shut them down and come out with the win,” Shaw said.The Quakers have now won just one of their last ten games.  HARVARD 3, PENN 1Coming off its loss to Columbia on Saturday, which marked Harvard’s first loss in five games, the Crimson came to Philadelphia looking for redemption and a fresh start.“We brought out good energy the first game because we had been a little lackadaisical in past games,” Shaw said.  “We jumped out early and were able to hold onto the lead.”“I think we got up to the plate more focused, determined and relaxed,” Bock added. “We were able to swing at pitches and get the runs we needed.”Harvard got the scoring going in the first inning when Schellberg drove in Macadam with a ground out to the shortstop.  The Crimson quickly increased its lead in the second inning when Francis scored off a Macadam ground ball and in the fourth inning when Vertovez scored an unearned run off a fly ball from Shaw.  Harvard and freshman pitcher Rachel Brown held the Quakers scoreless until the fifth inning.  The rookie allowed only one run in the 3-1 victory.“When she’s on the mound, we’re just really confident behind her,” Bock said. “We have a really confident mentality at the plate or on the field.”Next up for the Crimson will be Rhode Island, who the team will take on at home.“It’s important to play at home before our first Ivy League game at home,” Bock said. “Getting a game on our field since fall will be huge.”—Staff writer Lucy D.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Returning home refreshed and ready to kick its season into high gear after a week long training trip in Maryland, the Harvard sailing team competed in three regattas over the weekend, its most action in a single weekend to date in its young spring season.  Both the co-ed and women’s squads responded well from the additional practice over Spring Break, as the co-ed squad placed first in the Boston Dinghy Club Cup at home on the Charles and the women’s team finished a respectable runner-up in the Duplin Trophy Women’s Team Race in Medford, Mass.  Also, some individuals performed well in the Owen, Mosbacher, and Knapp Trophies in Kings Point, NY.“We had a very successful weekend,” sophomore captain Alan Palmer said.  “We were able to perform well at home and also had a strong showing down in New York.”BOSTON DINGHY CLUB CUPThe co-ed contingent led the Crimson’s efforts this weekend, as the squad emerged victorious from a field of eighteen teams in the Boston Dinghy Club Cup on the Charles River.  Harvard shared hosting duties with its counterparts from MIT for the regatta and ended the weekend thirteen points ahead of Tufts in the three division racing format.Skipper Palmer and senior crew Lauren Brants competed in the A division for the Crimson, finishing second in the most competitive division.  They started off their seventeen races of the weekend well, with two early victories and three second place showings in their first ten contests, and also finished strong, placing in the top five in all but one of their last six races.“There was a pretty steady wind out on the river,” Palmer said.  “It was a little different than our normal situation out there, but we were able to take advantage of being home.  We had a rough Saturday but were able to compete well on Sunday after bonding over Zoe’s My 3 Sons (some breakfast meal at a restaurant) on Saturday night.”Sophomore skipper John Stokes and junior crew Michelle Konstadt took third overall in the B division, finishing with 118 points on the weekend, just a mere two points out of second place.  All but one of their top five showings came within their last six races, as the duo matched its A division teammates in finishing well and securing team victory for the Crimson on its home waters.In the C division, senior skipper Jon Garrity split time with Brants and junior crew Winston Yan to finish fourth in that division’s seventeen races.  They won three races on the weekend and were runners-up in two other contests.“Any time you are able to put up three solid finishes in all of the divisions, you are going to do well,” Palmer said.DUPLIN TROPHY WOMEN’S TEAM RACEThe Crimson women’s squad placed a close second over the weekend at the Duplin Trophy Women’s Team Race to its counterparts from Boston College, and that school’s fine sailing program.  The regatta was hosted by Tufts on Upper Mystic Lake and was the women’s squad’s first ever team race intersectional.“We were very excited to compete in our first ever team racing contest,” senior Megan Watson said.  “Usually we do some team sailing as part of the co-ed squad, but we look forward to more opportunities for team racing as a women’s team and hopefully one day a women’s team racing national championship.”Once again the Crimson finished strong to claim their runner-up position over the two-day affair.  Harvard was tied for second with Yale with a 7-2 record after day one but then went on to post the best record of Sunday’s championship round at 5-1 to finish 12-3 on the weekend, just back of the Eagles 13-2 mark.“We won most of our races off the starting line,” Watson said.  “We had some really close races with BC and I think we have started a rivalry with them for the rest of this season and for the coming seasons.”Three women’s boats represented the Crimson in the regatta.  Skipper Watson teamed up with sophomore crew Meghan Wareham to lead Harvard, while junior skipper Liz Powers and freshman crew Alexandra Jumper also formed a duo over the weekend.  Freshman skipper Emily Lambert and rookie crew Annie DeAngelo formed the Crimson’s final pair in Medford.“The three freshman did a great job,” Watson said.  “It was a new experience for them and they did very well in translating what they saw on the chalkboard into actions out on the water.”OWEN, MOSBACHER, AND KNAPP TROPHIESHarvard’s efforts in New York over the weekend resulted in a tenth place team showing out of twenty teams in the Owen, Mosbacher, and Knapp Trophies.Sophomore skipper Teddy Himler was paired with sophomore crew Quincy Bock and took third in the A division for the Crimson.  The duo placed in the top four in nine of their fifteen races, winning one contest and claiming second in another.Freshman skipper Brendan Kopp and junior crew Alex Bick took home fifteenth place in the B division.“Teddy and Quincy had a strong showing in an equally competitive regatta with some Mid-Atlantic teams,” Palmer said.  “Brendan was competing in his first collegiate regatta and will only improve as he gains more experience.”While Boston College was victorious at this regatta over the weekend, Yale managed to claim the Knapp Trophy as the first finisher among Harvard, Yale, and Princeton and also collected the Mosbacher Trophy as the Ivy League champion.—Staff writer Thomas D.

The VOID is that empty time between 5am and 8am every night where there’s no one on gchat, no sound but your roommate’s blissful snoring, and nothing to think about besides the work you’re not getting done.  But you’re not alone, FlyBy is here to guide you through.
Life comes at you fast.  (Solid commercial series, eh?)
Break's over, folks.  That pile of work you left laying around from midterm season never really went away, no matter how far your mind drifted away from it over break.  FlyBy applauds you for taking the pain now...while all your friends find themselves scrambling for study guides late in reading period, you'll be loving yourself.
Speaking of commercials, FlyBy spent tons of time in front of the tube over break, whether absorbing a little Billy Raftery (ONIONS!) in the tourney (this one hurt the bracket), or the daily Law and Order marathon.  Here were a few of the gems, for your entertainment:
Heineken.  :25 is priceless.
McDonalds. Sure, the voiceover is kinda weak. But we're just suckers for a bitten lip.
Schick. Takes some serious brass to push the envelope like this...but we'd say it worked.
Nike. The best in a solid series of commercials for the tourney.
Audi. The identity theft is a fantastic idea...also gotta love the distinctive LED's Audi has on a ton of its models.
E*Trade. Confession: FlyBy wasn't a huge fan of the baby from the get-go, but as we've moved from this to this, it has been getting consistently funnier.

Where were you on March 31st, 2008 at 5 P.M? If you are in the class of 2012 here’s to betting you were locked away in your room, sitting in front of your computer screen, trigger finger eagerly refreshing away while you scoured your g-mail account for one fateful e-mail: your admissions decision.
But tomorrow you can lean back and relax, safe in your knowledge that the poor soul crossing all fingers and toes is not you.
Don’t lie though; we know you’re at least a little interested in knowing who will be part of the lucky ’13. At least we here at Flyby are, and we’re going to make it our business to stalk the class of ’13 like we stalk central administrators…and celebrities with twitter.
To begin, we have our own Official Unofficial Class of 2013 Admissions Predictions (drum roll, please):
Admittance rate: a record low of 6.7% (29,000 applicants divided by 1,948 spots offered last year)
Socioeconomic diversity: record high percentage of class on financial aid (the economy. period.)
Cultural/geographical/ethnic/gender/diversity: the “most” diverse class Harvard has seen (only to be defeated by the classes of 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017… and infinitely on…it's pretty much an admissions press release staple)
Stay tuned tomorrow for official numbers!

Log in to your gmail account. (If you don’t have gmail remove the protective rock you’ve been sleeping under and get an account).
Click on the little green erlenmeyer flask (shh don't pretend you didn't know what that was) on the top right of your screen.
Now scroll down and enable “undo.”
Now enable “mail goggles.”
You can thank us later.
By enabling these two experimental google mail applications you can now retrieve those undesirable e-mails you “accidentally” sent. You know, like the cover letter you sent that said your resume was attached… it wasn’t. Or the e-mail to your Dean complaining about lack of toilet paper, dated March 20th 3:30 A.M when you realized your lazy roommates stole your last roll. Or the nasty e-mail you sent to your ex/crush/random kid in your math class for, err, looking at you funny. Or any e-mail sent from 2-4:30 A.M (hint: the receiver can see when you sent it). Not that we have sent any/all of these. We swear. Really.
What’s even better is that now you can prevent yourself from ever sending late night e-mails. By activating “mail goggles” gmail will put you through a short math quiz to see if you are really in a state to send e-mail (note: automatically activates late night on weekends). This is the GREATEST invention since refrigerator locks.
Take note Mark Zuckerburg, google is actually making changes we LIKE.

There are some crucial college lessons that you just can't learn inside a classroom: how to make friends, how to manage your time, how to set fire to boats and release them into the Charles. The most important teaching to remember from your university experience, it seems?  WASH YOUR HANDS.
Babson College in Wellesley shut down its campus Saturday evening and will remain closed until Wednesday at 5:00 a.m., thanks to an outbreak of the norovirus.  About 100 students and staff have been affected by this virus, which Harvard University Health Services Director  David S. Rosenthal '59 says is usually spread through hand-to-mouth contact.  Rosenthal notes, "People who live in dorms and eat in the same dining rooms are prone to getting this type of thing."
More insightful medical advice after the jump.
Harvard has also been victim to a few of its own health epidemics in years past (scabies /wait-just-kidding-it's-not-scabies outbreak of October 2007).  In December of 1994, Harvard experienced a norovirus outbreak similar to that of Babson's and around 150 people were treated by UHS for vomiting and diarrhea.  Rosenthal says that the origin of the virus outbreak of 1994 was most likely a dining hall employee working the salad bar.  "One of the reasons we have Purell dispensers in the dining halls is because good hand washing can prevent the spread of this," he said.
So, lesson of the day: wash your hands.  Especially before touching a Babson student.

Last Friday, Harvard College’s student-run radio station, WHRB, released an iPhone application that allows subscribers to receive live broadcasts from the station. You don’t even need proximity to a WiFi connection.
Joseph A. Poirier ’11, the General Manager for WHRB, says, “I’m pretty sure we are the first college radio station to do this and only the second or third Boston station to do it.” So Harvard.
Dan J. Thorne ’11, WHRB’s Chief Studio Engineer, says, “A lot of Harvard kids have iPhones and iTouches. When I had one, radio applications like Pandora and Blast FM were really popular. Making one for us seemed like the logical thing to do.”
But let’s be real. How many people on campus are actually going to use this?
Let’s say about 3% of undergrads regularly listen to WHRB. Let’s also say that about 15% of the undergrad population has iPhones. Taking those two things to be independent (and acknowledging that they’re generous), about 30 College students will probably download this.
