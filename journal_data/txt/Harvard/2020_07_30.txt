After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has named Pulitzer Prize-winning Harvard Law School professor Annette Gordon-Reed a University Professor, its highest faculty honor, administrators announced Tuesday.
A world-renowned historian and constitutional scholar, Gordon-Reed’s work centers on race and slavery in colonial America. Her research on the Hemings family — who Thomas Jefferson enslaved — reframed how many Americans view the third president.
Gordon-Reed won the 2009 Pulitzer Prize in History and a MacArthur “Genius Grant” for her work on the Hemingses. In 2010, former President Barack Obama awarded her the National Humanities Medal, the nation’s highest honor for the arts and humanities.
Gordon-Reed said University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 surprised her with the announcement at a Tuesday Law School faculty meeting.
“I thought I was coming to talk about the entry level hiring committee that I’m the chair of, and I’m sitting there with my notes, ready to go on,” she said. “It was a ruse for which they apologized after, but there was no need to apologize.”
She added that she could never have imagined taking over the University Professorship of her own former professor, Laurence H. Tribe ’62, who retired on June 30.
Tribe taught Gordon-Reed constitutional law. He said in an interview that he remembers her as a bright scholar.
“She is one of the most brilliant students that I’ve ever had, and it makes it especially a source of delight and pride for me that a former student of mine would hold this distinguished professorship going forward,” Tribe said.
Gordon-Reed’s scholarship has come into the spotlight in recent months during a nationwide reckoning on race, as many Americans question whether leaders like Jefferson should be commemorated with statues.
Bacow told the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication, that Gordon-Reed has “changed how people think about America.”
“Through her extraordinarily incisive scholarship, she carefully reveals truth and, in the process, urges all of us to confront our past and present so that we might imagine a better future,” he said. “Her voice has never been more important to our national conversation, and I am thrilled that she will join the ranks of the University’s most celebrated faculty members.”
Created in 1935 to honor faculty members who pursue groundbreaking interdisciplinary work, University Professorships allow a cohort of 25 prominent professors to conduct research at any of Harvard’s schools. Current honorees include former University Presidents Lawrence H. Summers and Drew G. Faust.
Though she will focus on a Law School course this fall, Gordon-Reed said she will teach undergraduate courses in future semesters. She is also currently working on her second volume about the Hemingses, which will chronicle two parts of the family — one that remained in the Black community and one that remained in the white community.
Gordon-Reed also serves on a University-wide faculty committee formed last year to address and further research Harvard’s ties to slavery.
Law School Professor Elizabeth P. Kamali ’97 described Gordon-Reed as an “inspiration,” crediting her work with changing the field of American legal history.
“She embodies the word ‘professor,’ in its original sense of one who openly declares her beliefs and principles, and Harvard is all the richer today in counting her among its cherished University Professors,” Kamali wrote in an email.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Clio Griffin ’15, a Harvard undergraduate who held a deep-running passion for justice and service, died last week after an extended illness.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an email to College affiliates last week that Griffin’s professors remembered her as a “brilliant” and “thoughtful” student.
“Her kindness and compassion were obvious to everyone, from her professors in the classroom to her house community and beyond,” Khurana wrote. “Clio’s profound love for our Harvard community of fellow students should serve as an inspiration to us all.”
Griffin, who was on a leave of absence from the College, was a History concentrator in Quincy House. She is survived by her parents and sister.
Quincy Faculty Deans Eric A. Beerbohm and Leslie J. Duhaylongsod connected Griffin’s work in history to her interest in social justice.
“She was a sharp, thoughtful, and engaged student who saw history — in particular the history of race and racial thinking — as a way to make sense of contemporary issues,” they wrote in an email to house residents.
Beerbohm and Duhaylongsod also wrote that one of Griffin’s professors had described her intellectual interests to them as “quirky” yet “fascinating,” noting her sophomore capstone project that dealt with the history of fishing tools.
Carla Heelan, the History department’s assistant director of undergraduate studies, who taught Griffin in a seminar on European history, described her as “unfailingly curious and kind.”
“My memory of Clio is someone who was a very original thinker who delighted in nuance,” Heelan said. “Beyond her intelligence, she was also a very generous presence in the classroom.”
Heelan said that Griffin’s final research paper explored the impact of the radio for German citizens in the Weimar Republic. Heelan added that Griffin’s academic interest in “emancipatory tools” like the radio complemented her real-life commitment to social justice and service.
Beerbohm and Duhaylongsod testified to Griffin’s impressive record of service in their email to Quincy House. They recognized the time she spent volunteering with the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter and the Priscilla Chan Stride Scholars Program, a select group of undergraduates involved in public service initiatives, and noted that she had hoped to pursue a career in social work after receiving her degree.
In a separate email to The Crimson, Beerbohm and Duhaylongsod said they had heard about Griffin’s dedication to service work from fellow volunteers at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter during Quincy House memorial gathering held over Zoom.
“We were struck by the connection she made with her fellow volunteers and with homeless individuals during her many overnight shifts and her leadership position last summer,” they wrote.
Outside of her service work, Griffin, a former Crimson multimedia editor, was also a “valuable” early member of The Crimson’s Multimedia Board in its first year, according to her former Crimson colleague Jacob S. “Jake” Beech ’14. He wrote in an email last week that she was enthusiastic about video production and invested a significant amount of energy into creating multimedia content at a time when video was very new for The Crimson.
“I recall her bringing a lot of positive energy and optimism to our team meetings,” he wrote.
In a message to Quincy House residents last week, Madeleine Griffin, Clio Griffin’s mother, wrote that her daughter’s “wise and compassionate spirit” was always present whenever someone was in need.
"To those of you who knew Clio, you will hold fond memories of her always. To those of you who didn't know Clio, please know that the world has lost a funny, intelligent but, most of all, kind young woman,” she wrote. “Her departure causes us a grief beyond words, but we who love her will carry her beautiful spirit with us always, to help us to live the lives she wished for us.”
“On behalf of Clio, we (her parents and sister) ask you please to look after yourselves and each other,” she concluded.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students and alumni demonstrated outside University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s house Tuesday evening to call for the abolition of police on campus and the divestment of the school’s endowment from the prison industry.
Harvard Alliance Against Campus Cops — a coalition of more than 40 Harvard College students, graduate and professional school students, and alumni calling for the abolition of HUPD — was formed in the wake of the high-profile police murders of Tony McDade, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Rayshard Brooks, and others. Coalition members wrote in a press release that their protest was aimed at highlighting the police department’s deleterious impact on Harvard’s campus.
“At tonight's action, students and community members relayed the many ways in which campus cops destabilize and endanger students and community members alike,” the press release reads. “Students called upon President Larry Bacow to take responsibility for the danger he perpetuates against the Harvard community as the leader of this private police force.”
Outside Bacow’s house, protestors chanted, “No cages, no cops, this bullshit has got to stop” and “Disarm, disband, free them all, and free the land.”
Marina Multhaup, a Harvard Law School student and a press organizer with HPDC who participated in the demonstration, said the organizers had planted signs with one side naming “things we wanted to abolish,” including HUPD and the “criminalization of poor and black Cambridge residents,” and the other side naming “things we wanted to build,” including affordable housing and greater mental health care.
University Spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on the protest.
In January, The Crimson published an investigation that found repeated a history of racist and sexist incidents inside HUPD spanning nearly three decades. Roughly 20 current and former officers alleged Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley established a toxic culture within the department through court documents, discrimination complaints, and interviews.
Riley has since announced that he will step down from his post by the end of the calendar year.
In June, after HUPD officers were dispatched to protests in the wake of several high-profile police killings, Bacow announced a review of the department and its collaborations with local police departments.
Activists have also long urged the University to divest from the prison industry. Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign sued Harvard in February over its financial ties in prisons. The University filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit earlier this month.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard undergraduates living on campus in the fall will have “very limited” access to physical facilities, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an email to faculty and staff Thursday morning.
Administrators announced in early July that Harvard would house no more than 40 percent of undergraduates — including freshmen and upperclassmen who successfully petitioned for residency — in dorms for the fall semester. Regardless of whether they are invited to reside on campus, all enrolled students will have an entirely virtual course load.
Gay and Khurana wrote in their email Thursday that they were confident Harvard will successfully re-open its campus in accordance with its announced plan. Part of that approach requires prohibiting students living on-campus from accessing facilities beyond their assigned dormitory and dining hall, they added. Those living off-campus will not have access to any dormitories or dining halls.
“Our ability to expand on-campus opportunities and access for students later in the semester, something we aspire to do, will be determined by our ability to open successfully at the beginning of the term,” they wrote.
Though students both on and off campus are generally barred from accessing classrooms, laboratories, and libraries, Gay and Khurana noted a few exceptions have been granted, mainly to students who require access to complete their senior theses.
Gay and Khurana wrote that Harvard has banned all large performances, competitions, and other gatherings, adding that the Ivy League has also cancelled all athletics competitions for the fall semester.
“While we hope to make some performing art and recreational facilities available to students later this term, we are unable to do so at this time,” the pair wrote.
Gay and Khurana emphasized that faculty may continue to employ enrolled students, albeit remotely. They urged faculty to create work opportunities for students, but reiterated that — in accordance with Harvard’s normal policies — students who take a leave of absence are not eligible for student employment.
