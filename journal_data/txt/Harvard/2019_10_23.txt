After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Actor Shia LaBeouf, from Disney’s “Even Stevens” to “Transformers” to A24’s indie-drama “American Honey,” has been gracing the screen for over two decades. Whether you know him as mischievous adolescent Louis Stevens, Bumblebee’s sidekick Sam Witwicky, or the actor who seems to apologize frequently for his controversial actions, LaBeouf has been immersed in Hollywood culture for the majority of his life. But his latest movie, “Honey Boy,” is by far his most personal endeavor. Not only is he the screenwriter, but the film is based on his rise to fame and the dysfunctional relationship he had with his abusive father, who is played by LaBeouf himself.
“Honey Boy," following a nonlinear timeline, revolves around Otis Lort — who represents a young Shia — at 12 years old (Noah Jupe) as a child actor living with his father in a motel, and at 22 years old (Lucas Hedges) as a blockbuster-movie star in rehab, struggling with addiction and PTSD from his childhood. 12-year-old Otis has a complex relationship with his abusive yet loving father; an ex-rodeo clown, James Lort (LaBeouf) is volatile, argumentative, and unreliable, yet also fiercely protective of his son. The film documents the intense highs and lows of their relationship, and how Otis’s childhood experiences shape him later in life. “Honey Boy," with introspective directing and powerfully honest performances from Jupe, Hedges, and LaBeouf, is a heartbreaking reflection on the inextricable ties of family.
LaBeouf embarks on a challenging yet potentially healing experience by writing and portraying a highly nuanced and developed character based on his father. While James Lort relentlessly bullies his son, or abandons him on set, he also grapples with his own demons. As a recovering alcoholic and heroin addict, he attends group meetings where he has emotional reflections on his struggles with substance abuse, and expresses his desire to be a good father; his multidimensional character ultimately adds great depth to the film. Jupe and LaBeouf have natural onscreen chemistry, and convincingly portray the tense dynamic between father and son. Jupe is brilliant as young Otis, effortlessly innocent and evocative as a boy torn between the love he feels for his father and the abuse he endures from him — “I’ve missed you for a long time, Dad," he imagines saying to him in a bittersweet scene at the motel. LaBeouf is nothing short of painfully authentic, embodying the cruel and conflicting nature of his character with ease.
The film is cleverly edited to switch from 2005 to 1995 in a way that showcases deliberate parallels between the two phases of Otis’s life. Small moments mirror each other to depict the lasting impact of Otis’s childhood on his adult psyche. For instance, he’s shown swimming at his motel’s pool at 12 years old, then swimming at rehab 10 years later. Hedges delivers a simultaneously sensitive and frenetic performance as a mature Otis dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder. Living at a state-of-the-art rehab facility, he goes from therapy sessions to tending a farm with chickens to group swimming exercises; all the while, his addiction and trauma haunt him. “My dad’s not the reason I drink,” he insists in therapy. “He’s the reason I work.” As he reflects upon the physical abuse he faced, his hardened facade begins to crumble, and Hedges painstakingly portrays this fragile vulnerability.
The secondary relationship in the movie, which isn’t elaborated upon much, is between 12-year-old Otis and his neighbor, a young woman credited simply as Shy Girl, played by singer FKA Twigs. The two share a protective and tender bond as Shy Girl looks after Otis when his father falls short. Their dynamic is confusing as it is ambiguously intimate, bordering on inappropriate, and driven by little dialogue. Her confusing presence in the film leaves something to be desired, aside from one impactful quote as the pair watch a snake skitter across the surface of their motel’s pool — “You can walk on water ‘til someone tells you that you don’t know how to,” she intones quietly.
“Honey Boy” is music video director and documentarian Alma Har’el’s first time directing a narrative film. With warmth in each scene, every moment of “Honey Boy” feels intentional and reflective. What the film lacks in breadth — viewers see little beyond Otis and his father’s relationship — it more than makes up for in depth, with every nuance of their dynamic explored. What has the potential to come across as a selfish and ego-driven project on LaBeouf’s part is really a moving and bold depiction of the empathetic power of cinematic storytelling. As singer Alex Ebert croons the heartfelt lyrics of his song “Glimpses” in the final scene, “Honey Boy” proves to be a bittersweet and beautiful exploration of trauma.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One historically critical role of the American college system is to give students the ability to create meaningful relationships at a critical junction of their life. This is especially crucial in our age of increased levels of loneliness and depression amongst American teens.
At Harvard, social capital is too often under-prioritized compared to academics and extracurriculars. The shortage of social organizations on campus demonstrates this problem. There are only 13 official registered social organizations in addition to a handful of remaining unrecognized single gender social organizations. Thirty-seven percent of the 2018 graduating class reported being involved in an off-campus social group as opposed to Dartmouth, where approximately 60 percent of undergraduates are involved in off-campus social groups — most notably, Greek life.
It’s common knowledge that this social landscape is far from perfect. Final clubs with slim membership ranks have dominated the social scene. Guest lists for events that they host are kept short further adding to the clubs’ air of exclusivity. Freshmen are particularly excluded. Indeed, 55 percent of the graduating class of 2018 had an unfavorable view of final clubs.
But despite their failures, social organizations at Harvard can provide a great community experience — an experience that should be offered to all. Accordingly, participation in Harvard social life should be based on individual students’ choices.
The University’s attempt to break apart the exclusive membership system by forcing clubs to become mixed gender did not solve any problems. Rather, the College’s sanctions had a counterproductive effect — forcing the closing of female social spaces and incentivizing clubs to become more secretive. Additionally, the planned enforcement of the College’s sanctions based on having students rat each other out is toxic, patronizing, and shameful. Not only is the Dean of Students Office overreaching and infringing on the social decisions of students, but its policies will lead to mass distrust on campus.
A better proposal would be the creation of new final clubs. If the Harvard social scene was larger, people would self-select into clubs best suited for them. Of course, some clubs would remain exclusive. However, the separation between these clubs and the rest of the College would diminish. More students would be able to involve themselves in social organizations and the barriers around Harvard social life would fall.
The approach adopted by Princeton University serves as an interesting test case. At Princeton, 70 percent of upperclassmen are members of independent, coed “eating clubs” — social dining organizations. Each club brandishes a distinct character. Most importantly, half of the eating clubs maintain open admission processes based on a lottery system while half of the clubs are selective. This quasi-selective social system would suit Harvard well. Existing clubs could maintain their unique and historic characters while the creation of new “open” clubs would ensure that participation in a social club is a choice available to all undergraduates.
A critic could say that undergraduates have other avenues by which to build social capital. And Harvard students do construct meaningful relationships through participation in extracurriculars, athletics, and academic collaborations. But a disadvantage of these relationships is that their social aspects are often overlooked in relation to the original enterprises. Social organizations that are purely dedicated to building relationships are a better way to construct robust social capital and should be an integral component of Harvard student life.
On a practical note, starting an independent social organization is incredibly costly and difficult. An unfortunate implication of the University’s RSO policy is the disaffiliation of Harvard Greek life with its national chapters. National chapters provide funding and resources crucial to creating and maintaining Greek life on campuses across the country. The DSO should recognize the unintended consequences of their policy and provide funding for the creation and maintenance of independent, “open” social organizations for a few years until these organizations are able to form graduate boards capable of providing funding and governance.
Instead of focusing on existing clubs, the office should lower barriers for students willing to create new “open” social clubs. While this project would be a joint effort on behalf of the DSO and undergraduates, the College should maintain a hands-off approach to honor the independence of social organizations.
Social organizations around the country have come under heavy criticism for charges of hazing, racism, and elitism. However, these organizations are an important aspect of social capital on college campuses. Instead of throwing out the baby with the bathwater, undergraduates and colleges should try to fix the flaws in the current system. Harvard should be a model for creating a better social life on campus. The first step must be expanding the social system to make participation in an independent social organization available to all.
Widening social opportunities for students will allow more students to partake, mend flaws amongst some existing clubs, and ultimately create a more healthy and vibrant student experience on campus. So, Harvard – don’t close the clubs. Create more.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, more than 70 members of the Harvard Band walked out of their centennial banquet after an alumnus made an inappropriate and offensive joke about the group’s new policy for reporting sexual harassment. This incident is just one more example of what many students at Harvard already know: Harvard continues to be an old boy’s club.
We commend the students in the Band for taking a stand against this joke. This emphatic act of protest sent a powerful message about students’ values. These incidents cannot be taken as individual mistakes, but as signs of a larger, prevailing culture that the Harvard community — alumni included — must continue to confront with the utmost seriousness. It takes self-awareness from within organizations and action from students in order to cause meaningful change to happen.
The “joke” is a perfect example of why Harvard needs more preventative resources and avenues for reporting sexual assault and harassment, not just in Harvard’s academic settings but in extracurricular groups as well. While recent conversations have largely focused on sexual misconduct within the scholastic environment, we cannot forget that Harvard students’ and affiliates’ experiences take place in a variety of settings. Sexual misconduct occurs in various forms and places; a holistic, zero-tolerance approach to this misconduct must take into account the breadth of contexts that make up Harvard student life and define its culture as a whole.
A big part of this culture comes in the form of “jokes” that minimize experiences and poke fun at victims’ expense. These jokes are not funny and cannot be brushed aside as “poor” or a momentary lapse in judgment. This is especially true in light of the fact that not a week later the Association of American Universities released its 2019 campus survey on sexual assault and harrassment that found little to no change at Harvard since 2015 and that found upwards of a quarter of students had heard offensive or insulting sexual remarks or jokes.
The survey and experiences like these underscore the existence of a toxic culture on our campus — one that has existed for a long time and that shaped the experiences of students who have graduated. Therefore, it is no surprise that sentiments like this come up when former students return. As alumni continue their involvement in school activities, they should be cognizant of the fact that campus expectations and values will change over time.
What might have been accepted or overlooked not long ago as “locker room talk” or as a harmless joke is now understood for its deeper emotional and cultural effects. As alumni continue to be involved in the College, we encourage them to welcome the opinions of current students and acknowledge the changes that have taken place since they were students.

Halloween is just around the corner, and you know what that means!
It’s time for you to bust out your best costume. And no, I don’t mean the basic sexy nurse or the overused frat boy costume. I want you to get creative this year and to think outside of the box.
But, wait! Before you get too crazy, there’s one thing I’d like for you to keep in mind this Halloween when you’re out shopping for your costume.
Yes, Halloween is a magical time where you get to be someone you’re not for a night, but there are just some things you should not pretend to be. Here’s a quick example. Though you may have watched “Moana” and absolutely loved the characters of Moana and Maui — you should probably not dress up as either one of them.
“But, what’s so wrong with dressing up as one of them? They sailed across the Pacific and saved Motunui — they’re total badasses! I want to be just like them, even if just for a night, so why would it be so bad to dress up as one of them for Halloween?”
Yes, I understand that you love them — hell, I do too. When “Moana” was released back home in 2016, I watched crowds of little Samoan girls flood the theaters to see themselves portrayed in mainstream media for the very first time. I teared up as I witnessed them finally being reaffirmed as the beautiful, capable Pasefika girls that they have often been told that they are not. But it wasn’t just little Samoan girls that flocked to the theaters — it was the entire Samoan community. Because for the first time, the mainstream media was finally representing us as the strong, resilient people that we are, and not just the horrible, stereotypical image of oversized, lazy people that we are often showcased to be.
So you have to understand that figures like Moana or Maui are not just fun cartoon characters — they are representations of Pasefika people, our cultures, our histories, and our heritages. So when you dress up as one of them for Halloween, you are essentially dressing up as us. You are minimizing our cultures, our heritages, and our histories as nothing more than just a fun mask - one that you can put on and take off when it is convenient for you.
But, for us, these things are not just a mask, and they are not removable. We take pride in our cultures, our heritages, and our histories, even when they bring along with them histories of trauma and discrimination, and we don’t have the option of leaving them at home when it’s inconvenient for us. So when you put on that tapa cloth to be Moana or get a fake body tattoo to be Maui for Halloween, you get to have the cool, “exotic” costume that your friends admire. But you never have to suffer, or even understand, the histories of imperialistic thinking that categorized and continue to categorize us as “savage” and “primitive” because of our traditions and cultural wear. Because at the end of the night, after you’ve won a prize for “best” or even “most exotic” costume, you get to take it off and hang it back up in your closet. But we can’t.
But cultural appropriation rears its ugly head both outside of Halloween season and outside of Pasefika communities as well. We see it at “island” themed parties with grass skirts and cheap “lei’s.” We see it in costumes that mock indigenous peoples and in sombreros that make fun of Mexican culture. And we see it in the multitude of horrible cases of blackface, not only at college parties, but even amongst some of the most powerful people in government today.
Often times, I hear that when it comes to cultural appropriation, ethnic groups are too sensitive. Or that these attempts to dress up in our traditional wear are not supposed to be interpreted as appropriation but rather as appreciation. But when you make our traditional wear into costumes, you are not celebrating us — you are making our histories into myths to tell around the campfire, our cultures into popular trends in the media.
So while we invite you to celebrate our cultures, there are a lot of other ways to appreciate a culture that’s not your own than by dressing up as them for Halloween. And we challenge you to think outside of the box and get creative for figuring out better ways for doing that.

As the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences prepares to expand into the new Science and Engineering Complex in Allston — which is slated to open in June 2020 — current and prospective SEAS concentrators are conflicted about the expansion.
In an interview with The Crimson earlier this month, Dean of SEAS Francis J. Doyle III said the new complex will house several collaborative spaces — including active learning labs and a maker space — designed to foster exchanges of ideas between students and faculty members.
Several students said they are excited to take advantage of the new building's state-of-the-art facilities.
Electrical Engineering and Government joint concentrator Victor L. Qin ’21 said the building's size — reportedly four times that of the Northwest Labs — will provide fast-growing concentrations with the necessary space to develop.
“Mechanical engineers, electrical engineers — we need more lab space, we need more storage space for different clubs,” Qin said. “Allston provides us that space to grow in.”
Rushi A. Patel ’21, a Biomedical Engineering concentrator, said the increase in space will incentivize students to work on long-term projects that require storage — something he said he finds difficult given the current space constraints.
He added that the complex's proximity to resources like the Harvard Innovation Lab — a center for creative ventures next to the Harvard Business School — will foster an “interdisciplinary view of engineering” that lends itself well to innovative work.
Other students, however, said they were concerned that the geographical distance between Harvard’s Cambridge and Allston campuses would make taking certain courses less appealing.
“It sounds like it’s going to be a pain, especially for people in the Quad, because it’s just so much farther away,” said Kyle C. Sutton ’21, a Computer Science concentrator and Cabot House resident. “I’m basically taking every STEM class I need to take this year so that I don’t have to go to Allston next year.”
Computer Science and Philosophy joint concentrator London Lowmanstone IV ’21 wrote in an email that he was “worried” about being late to classes due to the required commute, particularly because he often likes staying after class to talk to students and professors.
Some students who are interested in taking classes both within and outside of SEAS said they think the distance might pose difficulties in doing so.
Computer Science concentrator Rachel Y. Hong ’21 said though she is optimistic about the physical expansion of SEAS, she also believes the move might make Engineering “more isolated than it already is.”
“I’ve definitely wanted to prioritize taking like music classes and humanities classes alongside STEM classes,” said Isaac S. Sebenius ’20, who has a secondary in Computer Science. “I hope that continues to be able to happen logistically.”
Jacob R. Jimenez ’23, who is considering a concentration in Engineering, wrote in an email that he worries the Allston campus may not be as accessible to non-SEAS concentrators.
“I want to be able to utilize the engineering labs and facilities whether I concentrate in the subject or not,” Jimenez wrote. “I think it’s important to make engineering resources available to all interested students on campus and fear that the Allston campus may create an even larger divide between SEAS and the rest of the college.”
Doyle said in an interview with The Crimson that he and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana have been working on plans to “bring more of the teaching mission of the FAS and the College into the [Science and Engineering Complex]” through incorporating non-engineering courses as well.
In light of these concerns, a majority of interviewed students said they hoped administrators would provide more information about the expansion’s logistics in the coming months.
“Right now, I’m sort of between intrigued and apprehensive, mostly because I don’t really have any idea what the new schedule is going to look like,” Computer Science concentrator Leor B. Fishman ’21 said.
Qin said that while SEAS administrators have hosted several open discussions for students interested in learning more about the move, he believes “the wider student population is not at all well prepared or as well informed about what the move is like.”
SEAS spokesperson Paul Karoff wrote in an emailed statement that SEAS administrators have done their best to communicate information to students regarding the upcoming expansion through both email and in-person meetings.
“We will expand our communication efforts, including student town halls, as the opening of the Science and Engineering Complex gets closer, and as more details about transportation, dining options, and the like become available,” he wrote.
Joon Y. Kim ’21, a Computer Science concentrator, said he predicts students will grow accustomed to the change with time.
“I think most people just think it’s like a location change — once it happens, it happens,” he said. “They’ll just get used to it.”

The Head of the Charles Regatta, an annual crew pilgrimage to Harvard Square, brought more than 250,000 spectators and 11,000 rowers to Cambridge this weekend to take in the sights and sample local businesses’ offerings.
The event is the world’s largest two-day regatta and the third-most attended event in New England annually, and often is one of the Square’s most lucrative weekends of the year, according to local business owners.
The Head of the Charles Regatta organization estimates that the regatta generates more than $55 million in revenue for the Square and its surrounding areas each year. A report published by the organization in 2018 revealed that the average person spent $321 over the course of the two-day event.
Several local business owners corroborated these statistics with anecdotes about increased sales and foot traffic.
Lush Harvard Square, a cosmetics store, saw a 36 percent increase in foot traffic compared to other weekends in October, according to manager Donovan Smolenyak.
Jason Xavier, the manager of Lizzy’s Ice Cream, said the increased sales reflected rates that the shop usually only experiences in the summer.
“On Saturday, we saw about $1,500 in sales. Typically, around this time of the year on Saturdays, we usually see $700, $800, maybe $1,000,” Xavier said. “Sales of $1,500 are more like summertime sales.”
Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said that a main challenge for local businesses is vendors selling merchandise near the river. She said that practice can distract spectators and risks keeping them from shopping at Harvard Square establishments.
Over the weekend, vendors on the banks of the Charles hawked Brooks Brothers Jackets, maple sugar-based energy drinks, and $22 lobster rolls to eager spectators.
Jillson noted that Harvard Square nonetheless tends to attract an influx of clientele during the Head of the Charles weekend.
“I think in fairness, people do love to come into the Square to walk around shopping, you know, see what's going on. So we welcome that and we encourage it and do everything we possibly can to make sure that people do walk up into the Square from the river,” said Jillson.
Laura Verrochi, the manager at Zinnia’s Jewelry Shop, added that the Head of the Charles brought a slight increase to their usual customer base.
“It definitely seemed to increase sales Saturday and Sunday a little bit, but it wasn’t anything too chaotic or insane,” Verrochi said. “It increased our business by maybe, like, 50-100 people.”
Other Square employees commented that the regatta not only increases foot traffic for their businesses but alters the demographic of their patrons as well.
Mark Lamphier, the store manager of Harvard Book Store, said that while weekends are always a busy time for the store, the Head of the Charles tends to attract younger clientele than usual.
“Weekends are already busy for us because we are still getting lots of tourists — you know, the mom, dad, and kid from Iowa,” Lamphier said. “Certainly, the Head of the Charles makes our weekend foot traffic skew a little younger. Some of them were buying books for courses at their various colleges, but we were also selling a lot of literary fiction.”
Elizabeth K. Doran, a bookseller at Grolier Poetry Book Shop, said that the influx of patrons allowed her to connect with and exchange ideas with new visitors.
“One family came and stayed for a long time talking about poetry and all of the poets that have come through the Grolier over the decades,” Doran said. “We love the Charles Regatta as it is an exciting part of the history of Harvard Square.”

Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said in a Friday interview he agrees with the verdict in the Harvard admissions lawsuit asserting that the College’s admissions processes are not perfect.
Federal judge Allison D. Burroughs ruled on Oct. 1 that Harvard’s admissions processes do not illegally discriminate against Asian American applicants, as anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions charged in its 2014 suit. Days later, SFFA appealed Burroughs’s decision, meaning the two parties will argue again before the First Circuit Court of Appeals.
Despite clearing Harvard of any wrongdoing, Burroughs recommended a number of improvements to the College’s admissions policies. She suggested Harvard provide admissions officers with implicit bias training, keep clear guidelines on the consideration of race in the admissions process, and monitor statistics for potential racial disparities.
Asked about Burroughs’s suggestions, Khurana singled out the value of implicit bias training. He noted that Harvard currently offers similar training for teaching fellows, faculty, and staff.
“We are far from a perfect institution,” he said. “I think figuring out how all of us become aware of the biases, stereotypes, and taken-for-granted assumptions that we have, and continually finding ways to be aware of that is something that has to happen at all levels of the institution.”
The lawsuit brought a national spotlight onto previously secret details of Harvard’s admissions process. Documents that became public included internal emails describing how administrators sometimes give special consideration to the relatives of major donors.
With the prospect of continued media attention, Khurana said the College must have transparent policies in order to maintain the public’s trust in its admissions process.
“We need to be transparent about what we do, so that it's easily communicated and understood, recognizing that a lot of what universities do is esoteric and nuanced and complex,” he said.
Khurana’s comments are only the latest in a years-long debate over Harvard’s admissions process. Critics, including SFFA, have derided the College’s admissions policies as unfair. They have argued that the use of subjective measures of merit — including the controversial “personal scores” that admissions officers assign to applicants — results in systematic discrimination against Asian American applicants.
Harvard has continually defended its “holistic” admissions process and argues that it must consider both subjective and objective factors to achieve sufficient diversity in its student body.
This debate came to a head with a three-week long trial in October 2018 that brought in students, Harvard administrators, and expert witnesses to the U.S. District Courthouse in South Boston.
Burroughs’s decision came roughly a year after the beginning of that trial and ruled in Harvard’s favor on all four counts. Though current students and administrators praised the ruling as a victory for Harvard, others, including SFFA lawyer Adam K. Mortara, denounced Burroughs’s ruling as incorrect.
The ruling will feature prominently in the pending appeals process, which experts say is likely to drag on for several years.
Days after SFFA appealed the case, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said he is confident that Harvard will prevail in the First Circuit. Bacow said he is less certain about how Harvard will fare if the case reaches the conservative-majority Supreme Court, as some experts have speculated.
Unlike Bacow, Khurana was close-lipped about Harvard’s prospect upon appeal.
“I refer those questions to the President. I am not a trained attorney,” he said.
Despite differing reactions, legal experts say the Burroughs’s opinion could serve as a roadmap as parallel court cases — like the pending lawsuit against the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill — scrutinize affirmative action at other universities.

Oscar-nominated actor Queen Latifah, Pulitzer Prize winning-poet Rita Dove, and five others received the annual W. E. B. Du Bois Medal before a packed crowd in Sanders Theatre Tuesday afternoon.
The medal is Harvard’s highest honor awarded to those who have made contributions to African and African American history and culture.
In addition to Latifah and Dove, this year’s recipients include co-founder of Black Entertainment Television Sheila C. Johnson; Andrew W. Mellon Foundation president Elizabeth Alexander; artist Kerry James Marshall; entrepreneur and philanthropist Robert F. Smith; and Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution Lonnie G. Bunch III.
The Kuumba Singers of Harvard College opened the ceremony with a performance of “Lift Ev’ry Voice and Sing,” which is widely considered "The Black National Anthem.”
At the beginning of the event, Henry Louis Gates Jr., director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research praised the seven medalists as “paragons of black excellence.”
“We are here this afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, celebrating not only achievement but also opportunity,” Gates said. “Our medalists, stars in the fields of art, literature, music, business, and even a queen, are people who made the most of their opportunities.”
Throughout the night, the award recipients took turns delivering acceptance speeches, following introductions made by University President Lawrence S. Bacow, Chairman of the Hutchins Center Glenn H. Hutchins ’77, among others.
In her speech, Queen Latifah — a versatile artist who both won a Grammy Award and received an Emmy nomination — urged students to persevere through challenges.
“I get in the backyard sometimes and I scream, ‘Fight! Fight! Fight!’ That's me fighting for my life. Fighting against drugs and alcohol, fighting against mental illness, fighting against racism, sexism, all of it. We going to have to fight,” she said.
Smith — who announced this past summer that he would pay off the college loans of some 400 Morehouse College students graduating in 2019 — spoke about never forgetting his roots.
“I realized that part of my job is to create opportunity. I have to give that light into our community and take all of the brilliance that is represented on this stage and all the brilliance that was represented in my neighborhood,” Smith said.
During his speech, Marshall — who is known for his artistic works depicting African American life and history — said he wants to challenge the notion in color theory that “blackness represented absence.”
Rather than a monochromatic color, blackness has many different dimensions, according to Marshall.
“Fundamentally, black doesn't collapse into simplicity,” he said.
This year marks the 50th anniversary of Harvard’s Department for African and African American Studies, the 45th anniversary of the Du Bois Institute, and the 400th anniversary of the beginning of slavery in the British colonies.
African and African American Studies Professor Cornel West ’73 closed the evening with an address commending the seven medalists for their accomplishments.
“400 years of being hated, look at the love they're still dishing. 400 years of being paralyzed, look at all the freedom they're still unleashing on the world. 400 years of being traumatized, look at how they heal us,” West said before an enthusiastic audience.
“That's the tradition of W.E.B. Du Bois,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard plans to reject for a second time a proposed merger between its largest and smallest unions, more than three years after the two groups first sought to combine forces, according to University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain.
In late September, the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers formally requested that the University allow them to merge with the Harvard University Security, Parking, and Museum Guards Union, an independent, unaffiliated union with roughly 80 parking monitors and museum attendants. HUCTW boasts a 5,200-person membership across the University, the largest of any union.
Nearly a month after the request was filed, however, HUCTW Executive Director Bill Jaeger said Harvard has yet to acknowledge or respond to it. The Sept. 25 request letter was addressed to Harvard Director of Labor Relations and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran and several other University administrators who work with HUCTW and HUSPMGU members.
“We formally ask that Harvard management respect these workers’ right to join the Union of their choice,” the letter reads. “Harvard’s Museum Attendants and Parking Monitors have clearly and persuasively voiced their view over the past four years – to us, to key administrators, and now to the rest of the broader Harvard community.”
Last month’s request is the second time the two unions have sought to merge. When they attempted to come together in May 2016, Harvard also rejected the request. Asked to comment on the status of the pending request, Swain said the University does not plan to change its 2016 decision. He added that a written confirmation of the University’s position is forthcoming.
In 2016, administrators cited a discrepancy between the unions’ proposal and rules spelled out in the National Labor Relations Act. The NLRA mandates that all unions certified under its terms cannot have both security guards and non-security guard employees within their ranks. HUSPMGU’s membership consists of museum guards and parking monitors, while HUCTW’s members include librarians and lab workers.
Jaeger, however, challenged the efficacy of this argument, citing a voluntary option. If a union wants to operate outside the terms of the NLRA, institutions can choose to voluntarily recognize them, said Samuel Estreicher, director of the Center for Labor and Employment Law at New York University, in a February interview with The Crimson.
“The guard issue is a non-issue,” Jaeger said. “It’s extremely common for employers with large units to voluntarily recognize mixed units.”
HUSPMGU President Curt E. Rheault said the unions can work with the University to solve operational or financial issues that may arise from the merger, which he anticipated might be additional concerns if the security guard question was resolved.
“We're willing to work with any of the University's concerns,” he said.
With HUSPMGU’s contract renewal negotiations set to begin next year, Rheault argued that it’s a “perfect opportunity” for his union to join HUCTW. He said special provisions in HUSPMGU’s current contract could be translated to a merged version with HUCTW that would allow for operations to proceed uninterrupted.
“We’re very open in both unions to listening to management concerns about how to make sure that we could implement the change in a way that wouldn't cause disruption to any operations in the art museums or in parking services,” Jaeger said.
For now, Rheault said that his members are “frustrated” about the status of the merger.
“HUCTW sent a letter. They [Harvard] know we want to join. But we’ve heard nothing,” he said.
“I understand they get bigger things on their plate to deal with than some orphan union, but they’ve got to remember that we’re the lowest paid employees at the University,” Rheault said. “A lot of them have these two jobs to make ends meet. So for them this is really important, like, really important.”

City Council incumbents continue to hold an edge in fundraising over their challengers less than a month out from Cambridge’s biannual municipal election, according to the recent campaign finance data available from the Massachusetts Office of Campaign and Political Finance.
Since the race officially began Aug. 1, incumbents have raised on average roughly $18,900, while the challengers have received average contributions of around $5,700, as of an Oct. 15 financial reporting deadline.
Councilor E. Denise Simmons leads the pool in fundraising for this period, having collected $32,710 total. The second highest fundraiser was Mayor Marc C. McGovern, bringing in $25,429.
Simmons wrote in an emailed statement that though the “hectic” council schedule has kept her busy, she has made a “concerted” fundraising effort in recent months.
“I’ve just been as aggressive as possible in making my case to my supporters,” she wrote. “In terms of how that fundraising momentum is used in the closing weeks of the campaign, it’s the same methods I’ve long used: sending out mail pieces, spending money on digital ads, and figuring out how to best get my message in front of as many people as possible.”
While incumbents have generally had more fundraising success in the past several months, some challengers have made a strong showing as well. Patricia “Patty” M. Nolan ’80 and Charles J. Franklin, both raised more than at least one incumbent since Aug. 1, reporting sums of $15,278 and $10,885, respectively.
Several candidates have much deeper pockets than this, but a large portion of those sums were raised before the candidacy filing deadline and are not included in the most recent disclosures, especially among incumbents who have been collecting contributions throughout their current terms.
David E. Sullivan, a Cambridge resident and former city councilor, said incumbents historically have had an advantage when it comes to fundraising, partially due to increased name recognition.
“They've had more opportunities to interact with people about issues or concerns that people have had over their time as an incumbent,” he said.
McGovern also acknowledged name recognition plays a large role in fundraising, though he said it can “cut both ways” when voters have to consider an incumbent’s voting record.
“The flip side of that is you actually have to take votes on things, and some people don't like the votes you've taken,” McGovern said.
With the exception of Nolan and Franklin, no challenger has managed to raise more than $10,000. Derek A. Kopon — who has raised less than $3,000 according to filing data — said that low fundraising has posed an issue for his campaign, but that a recent surge in contributions shows his message is “resonating” with voters.
Kopon has previously called for campaign finance reform, and has criticized other candidates — including McGovern — for accepting campaign contributions from those with ties to real estate developers.
“I do not want any contributions that come with a conflict of interest, and that means that the interests of those people who are giving me the money are not aligned with the interests of the people who I will be representing if I were elected to the council,” Kopon said.
He also suggested several ways to enact this policy, including a “voluntary pledge” or legislation.
McGovern defended his campaign and said he values contributions and support from several groups, including endorsements from the National Association of Social of Workers and several unions. He also said development in Cambridge has helped advance the city’s progress.
“Some people have decided that development is evil and anyone associated with development is evil,” he said. “We wouldn't be talking about how do we invest more money in bike lanes and public art. So somebody has to connect these dots.”
McGovern also rejected the idea that campaign contributions would influence his voting decisions on the council.
“I have never, and would never, take a vote I didn't agree with over a campaign contribution,” he said. “Basically, what these folks are saying is that anyone who takes developer money is unethical, dishonest and is paid off. I have to live with every vote I take.”

The Society for Neuroscience jointly awarded its Ralph W. Gerard Prize — a lifetime achievement award recognizing groundbreaking research in neuroscience — to Harvard Molecular and Cellular Biology professor Catherine Dulac and Medical School professor Michael E. Greenberg on Sunday.
Dulac and Greenberg have independently researched how mechanisms in the brain influence social behavior and developmental disorders.
The Society for Neuroscience awards the Gerard Prize — their most prestigious honor — to researchers annually.
The professors received the award in Chicago at the Society for Neuroscience’s annual conference, which draws more than 30,000 attendees each year. The award comes with $25,000 in prize money for the two to share.
Dulac and Greenberg have never collaborated in their research, though they both work at Harvard. Greenberg said Dulac’s research has been an inspiration for him.
“I’ve been inspired by her work. It’s foundational,” he said. “It’s exciting and exceptionally creative, so it’s wonderful to be able to share an award with a colleague like that.”
Dulac also said she highly regards Greenberg as a fellow researcher.
“It is also very special to be recognized with my colleague Michael Greenberg, who I highly admire,” she said.
Dulac’s research focuses on how the brain manages social interaction. She studies the neuroscience behind how animals interact with other animals of the same species. She said she wants to explore the integration of various technologies with neuroscience in the future and to develop a deeper understanding of animal behavior.
“To have a global theoretical understanding of particular behavior — that, I think, is the goal for the next few, or many, years,” Dulac said.
Josephine J. Wolf ’20, who works in Dulac’s lab, said she highly values Dulac’s research methods.
“The lab takes on very important questions within social behavior research, and professor Dulac approaches these questions using clever and novel experiments,” Wolf said.
Greenberg’s research focuses on the mechanisms that regulate gene expression and understanding how life experiences influence neuron activity. He said his work is particularly relevant to the study of developmental disorders like epilepsy and autism.
“That’s what we’re in search of — trying to understand how sensory experience through gene transcription activates changes in the brain that underlie learning, memory, and behavior,” Greenberg said.
Greenberg said his work was a group effort, citing the help of numerous students, post-doctoral fellows, and staff that have worked with him.
Marty G. Yang, an M.D.-Ph.D. student who works in Greenberg’s lab, said the award reflects both the quality of Greenberg’s research and his to mentorship.
“Lab members — both past and present — were thrilled to hear the great news from SFN. I think this award is not only a testament to [Greenberg’s] scientific accomplishments, but also a reflection of his generous mentorship throughout his career,” Yang said.
Previous winners of the Gerard Award include several Nobel laureates. Julius Axelrod, Bernard Katz, and Eric R. Kandel ’52 each won the Gerard Award and the Nobel Prize in Medicine.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Forty-three percent of white admits to Harvard College are athletes, legacies, children of faculty, or members of a hand selected list curated by top administrators, according to working papers by Students for Fair Admissions-hired expert witness Peter S. Arcidiacono.
The papers — accepted to the National Bureau of Economics Research last month — use data that the College made public as a part of its ongoing lawsuit with SFFA, an anti-affirmative action advocacy group. SFFA sued Harvard in 2014 alleging the College discriminates against Asian American applicants.
Arcidiacono — an economics professor at Duke University — co-authored the papers, which focus on admissions preferences for applicants to the College who are legacies or recruited athletes. Neither paper has been peer-reviewed; working papers are typically made public to engender discussion and feedback prior to formal publication.
The first paper revealed that 43 percent of white admits to the College are athletes; legacies; on the Dean’s or Director’s lists, which contain relations of donors and high-profile figures; or children of Harvard employees — together referred to as “ALDCs.” In contrast, less than 16 percent of African American, Hispanic, and Asian American admits are ALDCs.
“That kind of blew my mind a little bit,” said Harvard Graduate School of Education professor Natasha Kumar Warikoo.
The authors found that a white, non-ALDC applicant with a 10 percent chance of admission would see a five-fold increase in their chance of admissions if they were a legacy; more than a seven-fold increase if they were on the Dean’s List; and would be admitted with “near certainty” if they were a recruited athlete.
The paper included several counterfactuals to simulate the admissions process without preferences for legacies or athletes. In both scenarios, the number of white admits decreased. For example, only one quarter of white ALDC admits would have been admitted had they been treated as non-ALDC applicants.
Removing preferences for legacies and athletes would increase the number of African American, Hispanic, and Asian American admits, according to the papers.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane referred The Crimson to Harvard’s post-trial findings of fact which state that both Arcidiacono and University of California, Berkeley economics professor David E. Card — Harvard’s hired expert — found that Asian American ethnicity increases the likelihood of admission for ALDC applicants.
Card declined to comment, citing the ongoing litigation.
Georgetown University public policy professor and economist Harry Holzer — who signed onto an amicus brief supporting Harvard — said he found the analysis “straightforward” and “credible.”
“I wish Mr. Arcidiacono had made these results public before the case was settled, because in some sense I think it undercuts the case,” Holzer said.
Adam K. Mortara, the lead counsel for SFFA, has said that preferences for ALDCs — which he alleges are “white preferences” — necessitate affirmative action. He believes both should be done away with.
“Once that happens, the need for race-based affirmative action goes dramatically down, because these places aren't being set aside for whites,” Mortara said at a Harvard Law School event earlier this month. “In our alternative Harvard, we have to get rid of the privilege preferences, and increase socioeconomic preferences. And what they will get is a class of comparable racial diversity.”
The second paper found that the admissions advantage for legacies and recruited athletes has grown over time. For the Class of 2000, admit rates for legacies and athletes were four times higher than their peers; by the Class of 2017, their admit rates were nine times higher.
Despite falling from 7.5 to 4 percent of applicant pools over a period of 18 years, legacies and athletes have comprised a relatively stable portion of admitted classes — averaging 24 percent of each.
“It clearly adds up to the fact that [legacies’ and athletes’] relative advantage is growing over time, and the extent to which they deny admission to other deserving groups is growing over time,” Holzer said.
The paper found that despite the increasing number of minority legacy and athlete admits, the admissions advantage for legacies and athletes still reduced racial diversity at Harvard between the Class of 2000 and 2017.
“They contribute to everybody's lower rates of admissions,” Holzer said. “There might be reasons why Harvard and other elite schools give preference. We know that donors like it, we know the legacies give more money, all those reasons, but I think it's an important piece of work, and to me it undercuts at least one of the arguments that SFFA was making.”
Warikoo said she found the results “interesting” in light of recent attacks on affirmative action.
“These are the ways in which whiteness gets privileged in college admissions, and the interesting thing to me is the way that policies like affirmative action that are designed to increase access actually get attacked, rather than the policies that are — one could argue — discriminatory towards all students of color, including Asian Americans,” she said.
Arcidiacano wrote in an email that he plans to write more papers on Harvard’s admissions practices using data unearthed during the lawsuit.
“This sort of information is tightly guarded by universities,” he wrote in an email. “What we are doing in these two papers (and there will be more to come on other aspects of the case) is show what these documents reveal about various aspects of Harvard’s admissions process.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Chemistry Professor Roy G. Gordon ‘61 and Materials and Energy Technologies Professor Michael J. Aziz received an award earlier this month for their work to create an innovative battery to store wind and solar energy.
The professors were presented with the Eni Award for Innovation in Energy — which comes with a prize of 200,000 Euros and a gold medal manufactured by the Italian mint — at an Oct. 10 ceremony at the Italian President’s residence. Eni, an Italy-based oil and gas company, has distributed the award annually since 2008 and bills it as the “Nobel Prize for Energy.”
The battery uses abundant, non-toxic materials, unlike many other renewable energy batteries currently on the market, helping to reduce its price and increase its longevity.
“I was concerned with the battery technologies that are currently available because they have a number of deleterious aspects,” Gordon said in an interview. “They make use of toxic materials like cadmium, lead, and these are bad actors.”
“If they get into your body, they cause disease and even death,” he added.
The renewable energy sector has grown dramatically in the past decade as governments and oil and gas companies attempt to prepare for the worsening effects of climate change. Yet renewable energy storage has several barriers to overcome before it can become as reliable as more traditional energy storage, according to Aziz.
“The greatest obstacle to us getting the vast majority of our electricity from renewable sources like wind and solar energy is their intermittency,” Aziz said. “Cost-effective, safe, very large-scale storage could solve this problem.”
The award-winning battery is the result of roughly five years of work, said Gordon. He added that he hopes to continue improving it in the future.
“I don’t think we’ve solved the energy storage problem yet,” he said.
The duo are in communication with manufacturers about producing their product on a large scale. Gordon sees a future in which the battery can power the homes of millions of Americans, either from the basements of individual houses or “centralized” facilities such as an electric utility.
Martin Jin, a graduate student in Gordon and Aziz’s lab who helped develop the battery, said he believes the professors’ research could go a long way toward solving the environmental crisis.
“They are really doing a great job in helping the world develop sustainably and help solve the energy issue,” Jin said. “Working with them, I feel very honored.”
Aziz argued that protests can only go so far in addressing climate change and that ultimately, vigorous research holds the key to finding long-lasting solutions to the environmental crisis.
“Standing in a protest line is valuable,” he said. “But it doesn't get the problem solved the way that you can do if you have skills and apply them to technical solutions or policy solutions.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Across sports, there is a commonly-understood term known as the “must-win.” A Game Three for a team down 0-2 in a best-of-five series. A Week 15 game for a team on the bubble of playoff elimination.
Rarely however is the term “must-win” applied in context to an entire season. But here we are in October, before a single minute has been logged in the 2019-20 Harvard men’s basketball season, and the narrative that will loom over this team is unquestionably clear: the team is too talented, too experienced, too well-coached to achieve anything less than an Ivy League championship, an NCAA berth, and success deep into March.
As early as May, the so-called “pundits” of the college basketball ecosystem have quickly done their part in elevating this program into the national spotlight. Esteemed insider Jon Rothstein slotted the Crimson at No. 23 in his Preseason Top 25 on May 30. The Crimson was named the consensus Ivy champions in an ESPN mid-majors preview article, and a preseason Ivy media poll released Tuesday saw 15 of 17 first-place votes go to Harvard.
Moreover, for the touted Class of 2016 featuring four players in the ESPN Top 100, this is quite simply the last chance. After falling short their first three seasons, the expectations that will be placed on this group of seniors, two of whom were each recently nominated onto national watch lists, are simply championship or bust.
So yes, this team will be a must-see on campus and on the road.
The two aforementioned seniors in point guard Bryce Aiken and wing Seth Towns will finally have a chance to play together again; due to injuries these past two seasons, the pair enters this season having only shared the court for 39 games (about a season-and-half out of three).
Ivy League Rookie of the Year Noah Kirkwood will be joined by an exciting five-man class of first-years featuring Massachusetts Player of the Year Chris Ledlum. Returning of course will be the gritty defensive play of Justin Bassey and Rio Haskett, the rim-attacking prowess of Danilo Djuricic and Rob Baker, the mid-range deftness of Christian Juzang, the big-play potential of Kale Catchings and Mason Forbes, the untapped potential from Spencer Freedman and Reed Farley, and finally, all the benefits of having two traditional back-to-rim big men in Chris Lewis and Henry Welsh.
In other words, the biggest headache coach Tommy Amaker may have this season — if the team can make it to March relatively unscathed from the injury bug — is the question of playing time. The endless permutations of lineups will provide great fodder to fans and journalists alike, but it does not make the job of the man in the second floor Lavietes office any easier.
Unless Amaker attempts to adopt a platoon-style system reminiscent of the 2014-15 Karl-Anthony Towns/Devin Booker/Willie Cauley-Stein Kentucky side, certain players may see a surprising dearth of time on the court. There simply isn’t a way to allocate 40 minutes to a side that lost little in graduation and will add back the former Ivy League Player of the Year in Seth Towns and one highly-touted first-year into the rotation at the minimum.
This is why the theme of ‘sacrifice’ that Amaker made last season’s motto will need to be recycled again this season. For the new recruits up to the more seasoned upperclassmen — some who have never had to grasp the concept of being a bench contributor in their AAU and high school ball years — this season may be one of Sacrifice 2.0.
Furthermore, I argue that perhaps oxymoronically, what this ‘must-win’ season necessitates is Patience 1.0. The hodgepodge of unique strengths (and weaknesses) on this season’s roster means that it is equally critical that this program is given the time to adapt, experiment, and mold into the unit it aspires to be this season.
Call this the 2011 Miami Heat ‘grace period’ if you must. Obviously, I am not suggesting there is an equivalence to LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh on this team, but those on the outside need to give this team some space to figure out what works and doesn’t. Unlike past seasons with a few ‘gimmie’ games, the Crimson will face a quite formidable early slate featuring Northeastern, Buffalo, and Texas A&M to kick off their season. So the experimental stage for Amaker’s squad will come straight against a Buzz Williams-led side, for one.
To make clear, I am not arguing that we should temper expectations — I for one will be the least bit surprised if the Crimson fight tooth-and-nail against these competitive non-conference foes. If this is the case, we must still understand that there will still be a great deal of variance over a five-month season. There will be significant hurdles to climb as well as late-emergers who claw their way into a spot in this deep rotation. Take Kale Catchings or Rob Baker, who both elevated their stock late in the season, as great examples of this.
Additionally, we do the rest of the Ivy League an injustice if we are not to acknowledge the strength of programs like Penn, Yale, and Princeton who have made leaps and bounds to compete against the recruiting prowess of Tommy Amaker. To assume this side will run over the Ivy League at ease is misinformed even if the Crimson achieves remarkable non-conference success.
Therefore, as much as excitement and ‘hype’ can fuel a program as talented as this one, it becomes dangerous if it is too unidimensional and those within a program become excessively glorified or commoditized. The spectator can be immune to the ups and downs that any individual or collective of individuals will face in a five-month span, expecting unwavering success. But no Division I athlete or program operates without some imperfections.
The 2019-20 Harvard men’s basketball program has the potential to be historic, but let’s allow that path to be more versatile and open-ended than a simple straight line upwards.
See you at Lavietes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson’s win streak increased to four on Saturday with its 31-21 victory over Holy Cross. Visiting the Jesuit school in Worcester, Mass., Harvard (4-1, 2-0 Ivy) picked up its first road win of the season with the Crimson’s opening loss in San Diego representing the only other time this team has competed outside of Harvard Stadium.
On paper, the Crusaders (3-4, 1-0 Patriot) looked to be a more worthy opponent. It took a boot in the dwindling seconds of the fourth quarter from Crimson record holder, senior kicker Jake McIntyre to win the contest in 2018. In 2016, the only other time anybody on the current Harvard football roster played Holy Cross, the Crimson lost.
At home, the Crusaders are traditionally better against the team from Cambridge, having won four of the last five contests on its own field — prior to Saturday. Factor in this year’s homecoming crowd and the competent Holy Cross team looked stout.
“They are better team than they were a year ago,” said Crimson coach Tim Murphy before the game. “They’re playing at home. They’re playing at homecoming. It will be a big crowd. It will be a very emotional, intense Holy Cross football team we play. We’re going to have to play better than we did a week ago to get a victory.”
Harvard did just that on Saturday afternoon.
PUNTERS ARE PEOPLE TOO
After last weeks victory over Cornell, Murphy was joined at the postgame presser by two unfamiliar faces to the media, sophomore punter Jon Sot and junior punter Sean McKeogh.
“Suffice it to say, 33 years as a head coach, this is the first time I’ve ever invited two punters to the press conference,” Murphy said.
If last week didn’t showcase the adeptness of the Crimson’s duo of punters, this week did. Punting statistics are notoriously difficult to read. Average kick distance isn’t informative given the different field positions that punters are required to adapt to. A 30-yard boot downed at the one is far better for the team than a 60-yarder that rolls out the back of the end zone.
The one clearly positive statistic is the number of kicks that are downed within the opponent's 20-yard line. Against the Crusaders, McKeogh kicked six times, five of which landed within the 20.
Working a duo of McKeogh and Sot, it seems that the former is brought in to try to get the ball as close to the end zone as possible without going over. Sot, last year’s first team All-Ivy honoree as a freshman, is sent in exclusively to send the ball as far as possible down the field.
Like McKeogh, Sot is good at his job. Early in the third quarter, Harvard faced a 4th-and-14 at its own 14-yard line. Sot was trotted out to take the kick. His punt sailed over the head of Holy Cross returner Jon Jon Roberts and was finally downed at the Crusaders’ own 10-yard line — a 76-yard punt.
“It got over our kid’s head,” Holy Cross coach Bob Chesney said. “Our kid was at 55, not thinking [Sot] could kick 70 something in the air and he did.”
For comparison, the longest punt in professional football this season is the Chicago Bears’ Pat O’Donnell’s 75 yarder, one yard short of Sot’s.
“You feel like you're in an alternate universe, the way that our punter’s are punting the ball,” Murphy said. “We knew they were good...We knew they were talented, all of a sudden they're really embracing their role as being able to impact the game.”
HUMBLE BEGINNINGS
Despite the 4-1 overall record, the Crimson hasn’t been the most adept at starting games. This week was no outlier. Three plays in, Crusader running back Domenic Cozier drew first blood, taking a give 66 yards for the score. Holy Cross wouldn’t score again for almost 30 minutes.
“We still do this thing where we seem to give up a touchdown in the first series, and then we seem to play pretty much lights out for the rest of the game,” said senior defensive lineman Brogan McPartland. “...we're going to try to cut that out.
In four of Harvard’s five contests this season, the opponent has scored first. In three, the opponent has scored within the first three plays.
Ivy League rival Brown scored in less than a minute. On the third play of the opening drive, Allen Smith weaved between Crimson defenders to log the 22-yards needed for the score. In the opening week, San Diego quarterback Reid Sinnet didn’t even bother waiting for the third play. On the opening snap, he found receiver Michael Bandy on a 65 yard toss. The drive took eight seconds.
Cornell had to wait four minutes to score first — though it still managed to do so on its first drive — as Big Red wideout Eric Gallman hauled in a 10-yard pass from Richie Kenney.
Howard stands as the only team so far this season that hasn’t beaten Harvard to the end zone.
MAINTAIN D-LINE
By all measures, the Crimson has a good defense. Prior to last week’s contest, Harvard led the nation and division in team sacks as well as leading the nation and division in rushing defense. Added to the defensive front, the Crimson led the nation in blocked punts.
“It all starts with defense,” Murphy said. “That’s always been my philosophy. If you can’t play defense, I don’t care how good your offense is, even in the PAC 12, you’re in big trouble. Bottom line is, you’ve got to get off the field. You’ve got to make stops.”
The permeation of Harvard’s defensive excellence was most visible this weekend in the first-down stat line.
The Crusaders didn’t manage a first down that wasn’t a touchdown until over halfway through the third quarter. The box score showed Holy Cross with a single first down in the first half. That first down was technically the rushing score on the third snap of the game.
The team did finally convert without scoring in the third quarter when Holy Cross quarterback Connor Degenhardt hit Ayir Asante across the center of the turf for 15 yards.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s soccer dropped a crucial home game on Saturday afternoon, falling, 4-2, to Brown in a battle of the last two Ivy League unbeatens. The loss snaps a seven game win streak for the Crimson, which had kept five consecutive clean sheets since last giving up a goal a month ago.
In none of those five games did Harvard (10-3, 3-1 Ivy) have to deal with a team as athletic or physical as Brown (10-1-1, 4-0). The Bears peppered the box with dangerous crosses and crashed the net. They put pressure on senior Crimson goalie Kat Hess and scored on two set pieces and two rebounds off of Hess parries.
“Each team has got their strengths,” Hess said. “They’ve definitely got their height and athleticism in the air and that’s something that’s been good for them this season.”
Brown’s senior midfielder Abby Carchio was the straw that stirred the drink for the Bears for much of the afternoon. Her corner in the fifth minute was deposited into the net by sophomore forward Rebecca Rosen, whose uncontested header punctuated an excellent start to the game by the visiting team and quieted the announced crowd of 634 at Ohiri Field.
Carchio was also the catalyst for Brown’s second goal, which came with just seconds to go in the first half and broke a 1-1 deadlock. Her ball into the box was punched out by Hess, but right to the foot of senior midfielder Celia Story, who made no mistake and fired into an empty net to deflate a Harvard team that had clawed back into the game after starting slowly.
“I think we had the momentum at that point,” head coach Chris Hamblin said. “We had created a lot of chances, we had more of the ball, so I think it was a challenging time to concede. And the nature of the goal was challenging, because we thought our goalkeeper came out and made a fair play on the ball and then was hit late, which allowed their player to hit the ball into an empty net. To get scored on against the run of play on what we thought was a foul, that does leave a bad taste in your mouth as coaches and as players. So we had to reset ourselves and come back out, and that stinks, because you’re riding the momentum, and you want to go into the second half at 1-1, so that goal definitely was a punch in the gut for sure.”
The game was put to bed in the 58th minute, when Brown’s humming attack hammered home two goals in 17 seconds of play, stunning the previously stout Crimson defense. First, another Carchio set-piece, this time a free kick, was finished by junior forward Star White, who had created an inch of space for herself in the box.
“In the second half I thought we came out with the right mentality but gave up another set piece goal,” Hamblin said. “When you’re giving up goals on set pieces like that, you just put yourself behind the eight-ball.”
The Bears extended their lead to three when an excellent through-ball behind the Harvard defense found Brown’s leading scorer, freshman forward Brittany Raphino, who pounced on the rebound of her saved shot and finished past the Crimson’s goalie with her second effort.
Harvard did show off its offensive firepower against a Brown team that had conceded just three goals on the year. The Crimson started slowly offensively but capitalized on a free kick in the attacking third to tie the game at one in the 20th minute. Freshman Gabby DelPico found freshman Angela Caloia with the free kick, and the U19 Italian National Team forward volleyed the ball into the back of the net from close range.
The link-up between the freshmen was nothing new, as by the NCAA’s point-tabulation system, which gives two points for a goal and one for an assist, they rank first — Caloia, with five goals and 10 assists — and second — DelPico, with six goals and five helpers — in points on the up-and-coming Harvard team.
The game opened up after the intermission as the Bears and Crimson took 12 and 11 shots at goal, respectively, in the second half. Just minutes after Brown’s back-breaking two goals in 17 seconds made the game 4-1, explosive junior attacking midfielder Murphy Agnew received the ball in space, drove the ball at the defense, and took a shot from outside the box that bounced off the bottom of the crossbar and somehow did not go in.
It was another reminder of Agnew’s talent, and Harvard will hope she is able to return to the lineup next weekend after she hobbled off the field in the 79th minute with an apparent leg injury. The New Hope, Pa., native missed two games earlier this year due to a leg injury.
After Agnew hit the bar, the Crimson continued to pour players forward as it sought a way back into the game. Harvard eventually did get a second in the 89th minute, as another DelPico set-piece — this time a corner — led to a goal, this one off the head of junior defender Cammie Dopke. But it was little more than a consolation on a tough day for the Crimson, which falls into a tie for second in the Ivy League, a game behind the Bears.
The fact that these two teams were battling for first place midway through the league season speaks volumes about the directions of the two programs. They each finished .500 overall last season and were in the middle of the pack in league play. But both programs got infusions of talent, with freshmen like Caloia and DelPico on Harvard’s side and dangerous freshmen forwards Raphino and Ava Seelenfreund on Brown’s.
“I think if you look at the games we’ve played over the last four or five years, we’ve had ties, we’ve had come-from-behind victories for us, obviously a victory here for them, so I think it’s been back and forth over the last few years,” Hamblin said. “I think some of the better players on Brown are their younger players, I think we’ve got a lot of talented younger players — I think the league in general is getting better, so I do see both teams being successful. I think this is a good lesson for us, though, and we need to do a better job playing against physical teams. We’ll figure that piece out.”
The Crimson will look to rebound next Saturday when it hosts Princeton, which was the Ivy League’s NCAA Tournament representative last season but is just 1-2-1 in league play this season.

For many of us, the parts of campus that lie beyond the Science Center or Annenberg remain a total mystery. You may have heard vague mutterings about the labs where STEM students roam or the life-sized animal statues scattered around, but what really exists past the Science Center? We’ve picked some of our favorite hidden gems to help start your campus exploration.
Fung Library
Located in the basement of the CGIS Knafel building (that’s the one next to the Graduate School of Design), this library is a nice change of place from the usual Widener or Lamont. The giant skylight on the ceiling is great for getting some vitamin D, even when it may be a bit too cold to actually enjoy the outdoors. There’s also plenty of desk nooks for when finals season rolls around that are at least a little less sad than the ones you’ll find in Lamont.
Adolphus Busch Courtyard
You can find this gem in arguably one of the prettiest buildings on campus, home to the Center for European Studies. The courtyard is a quiet oasis with a fountain right in the center and plenty of seating to relax in. This might be one of the most hidden spots on our list, and its fountain is only functioning from May to November. Make sure to check it out soon, or return in the spring when the flowers are in bloom!
Buckminster’s Cafe
Hidden directly behind the Science Center, Buckminster’s is located at the Laboratory for Integrated Science and Engineering building. Right outside you can find some spots perfect for grabbing a coffee with friends while the weather is still nice, and inside the cafe there’s plenty of well-lit tables where you can complete your latest pset in style.
Northwest Labs Cafe/Basement
While it may strike fear into the hearts of non-STEM kids, Northwest Labs features a great cafe for spending your BoardPlus if you happen to venture out that far. Not to mention, the basement is perfect for doing work — or reliving your First Chance Dance glory days!
Bio Labs Rhino Statues
Apparently their names are Bessie and Vicky. I love them. That is all.
Sure, some of these locations might lie outside the maximum five minute walking radius that many of us are reluctant to deviate from, but hopefully the great views, cool cafe options, and sweet study spots are enough to tempt you into exploring this side of campus.
