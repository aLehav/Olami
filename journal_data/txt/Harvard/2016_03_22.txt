After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a tight and tense episode, Maggie and Carol navigate through the damaged psyche of their captor, Paula, and must answer for Rick and company’s murderous rampage through Negan’s compound. This episode, which takes place largely within two underground rooms, focuses upon interiority and fleshes out both Maggie and Carol as the show’s two central female characters.
Women play a refreshingly larger role here, marking one of the few times “The Walking Dead” passes the Bechdel Test with flying colors, with a whopping five women shedding any residual concepts of archaic femininity left over from a pre-apocalyptic society. The collapse of gender roles is best exemplified when the one man, evocative of Ed from the first season, attempts unsuccessfully to beat a bound Carol with impunity. His fate has been sealed.
Even in its attempts at subversion, however, “The Walking Dead” sometimes affirms traditional gender roles. While the show often exhibits whole and empowered female characters (e.g. Deanne), they sometimes still seem bound by what they are expected to do as women. Maggie’s current major conflict deals with the questionable—even impractical—birth of her child in such a terrible world. Her insistence upon becoming a mother in the face of doubt and strife speaks to the problematic idea of a “maternal instinct,” or the unfettered and predetermined inclination towards nurturing others. Indeed, for the many male characters damaged by trauma and consumed by aggression, particularly Crazy Rick, the show often positions its female characters to act as emotional caregivers. Rick found solace in Lori, Jessie, and now Michonne. Abraham, for some reason, must choose Sasha over Rosita as a lover because it is impossible for him to be merely friends with a woman. Perhaps by depicting this world’s regression to a simpler, tribe-like society of disparate communities, “The Walking Dead” knowingly posits these gender dynamics as rooted in evolutionary theory, suggesting that viewers should be glad that males and females are no longer restricted to what has often been touted as biologically determined.
This theory is juxtaposed with Carol’s own history. In losing both her husband and daughter, despite efforts to keep them both alive, Carol often feels like a failed mother. Therefore, Carol’s considerable concern over Maggie’s safety is cast as her own residual “maternal instinct” kicking in, making up for past failures. Carol cleverly feigns vulnerability and piety in order to trick Paula into believing she is weak, submissive, and unthreatening. By the end of the episode, however, viewers are left to question how much was really a manipulation and how truly broken Carol is beneath her cool and coarse persona. “The Walking Dead” boldly confronts motherhood and gender roles in compelling ways other shows with more overtly feminist agendas do not. Even amidst empowerment, the show’s female characters still have problems and flaws, both resisting and embracing societal expectations of the roles women must play post-apocalypse.
The episode is more explicitly concerned, however, with thrusting the responsibility of Rick’s preemptive, unprovoked, and calculated invasion of Negan’s compound into the hands of Maggie and Carol. Paula’s own friends were killed by Rick’s group and, by group identification, technically Maggie and Carol. These two women represent everything that Paula has been fighting to overcome. Yet she is forced to keep them alive in order to conduct a trade, despite the temptation to execute them outright. She goes out of her way to shame them, to say that they are not “the good guys,” which is a poignant point considering that in following Rick’s group as our protagonists, they are assumed to be “right.” It boils down to a conflict between two groups, similar in almost every way, fighting for survival. What is baffling is why the showrunners felt the need to dedicate an entire 45-minute episode to make this point when it was already implied visually during last episode’s shocking bloodbath. The audience know that our protagonists have chosen to damage their humanity and moral purity for convenience and survival. This aptly named episode places both hero and villain in “The Same Boat”—to explicitly tell an underestimated audience just how similar people can be across arbitrary differences.

Are you uncertain as to the correct pronunciation of “Halsey?” Does it sound kinda weird when you practice saying it out loud, just to yourself? Did you try to brush the problem under the rug, hoping her fame would be short-lived?
Me too! But when her name appeared on Justin Bieber’s latest album, she seemed to be sending us a sort of coded message, something along the lines of “LEARN MY F-----G NAME ALREADY.” So after some research tactics held to the most rigorous of journalistic standards, we’re happy to report that the universally accepted pronunciation appears to be hall-see. Say it five times fast! With that off your shoulders, you’re at leisure to enjoy her latest music video, “Colors.” This work does an impressive job of pointing out the oft-neglected luxuries of modern life, specifically Taylor Swift and social media.
Halsey is cast as the lead in this new piece. This decision is meant to initiate a string of striking similarities to T-Swift, who is also typically cast as the lead in her own music videos. Equally uncanny is their shared hair color. Halsey has been known to experiment with a range of shades, and this year has largely consisted of her “blue phase.” In “Colors,” however, she appears onscreen with platinum blonde locks. A strange choice for a song with the refrain “Everything is blue”—and one that can only be explained by a deep-seated desire to become Taylor Swift.
Two other instances of imagery from “Colors” confirm this suspicion. First, Halsey spends the majority of her time onscreen taking Polaroid pictures, putting those Polaroids in her mouth, and glueing the Polaroids of her middle-aged lover into a scrapbook (more on this later). But wait…no one takes Polaroids anymore, right? No one except Taylor Swift! #1989. Second, Halsey only puts her camera down for the shots during which she repeatedly applies an obnoxiously red shade of lipstick. But wait…no one could possibly wear that many coats of red lipstick, right? No one except Taylor Swift! #Red.
The specter of Taylor Swift adds to Halsey’s greater message in “Colors”: an appreciation for all things millennial. The 1950s-prep school world in which this video takes place is harrowingly devoid of social media. The basic storyline is that cute, blonde Halsey is hopelessly in love, so much so that she must resort to pining by rolling around on her bed in her underwear. The beginning of the video leads us to believe her love interest is the character played by dark-haired hunk Tyler Posey (of “Teen Wolf” fame). Nope. It turns out it’s actually Posey’s middle-aged dad, whom Halsey’s mother is also doting on! Did you just cringe? Watch the video, and you’ll cringe harder.
Her secret crush finally becomes not-so-secret when she accidently drops all the secret Polaroid pictures that she has been stalkerish-ly taking of her man through a crack in the country club locker room door. And just her luck—she drops them ONTO Posey. That may sound confusing, but the moral of the story is this: Thank God for Snapchat. If she’d only been born into the 2000s, those creepy pics would have vanished seconds after she took them. Even the ones she screenshotted would be safely hidden in her camera roll, instead of falling into her boyfriend’s son’s lap. On top of that, if she were a millennial she would know that Tyler Posey has 2.3 MILLION followers on Instagram! Look at that social currency! Why would she waste her time on his dad?!
Halsey wants people to stop blaming things like short-attention spans and social anxiety on technology and start appreciating our iPhones a little more. In the old days, a lack of apps ruined the lives of underage girls and their 50-year-old lovers. And Taylor Swift wasn’t even alive.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Martha Tedeschi, currently deputy director for art and research at the Art Institute of Chicago, will become the next director of the Harvard Art Museums, the University announced March 9. Tedeschi, who received her Ph.D. at Northwestern University and who specializes in British and American art, will lead the newly renovated museums beginning in July. This week, Tedeschi talked with The Harvard Crimson about her aspirations, anticipated challenges, and new ideas for the arts on campus.
The Harvard Crimson: What are you most looking forward to in your new role?
Martha Tedeschi: The thing that I think I’m getting most excited about as I get closer to my start date is working with students at all stages of their careers…. I’m very excited about working not only with what I understand are inspiring [Harvard undergraduates], but also with all the professional schools. I’m very interested in... how the museum can help students at various levels of their training develop specific skills that they’ll need as they go forward. I’m talking not only about students training for curatorial careers or work in the museum field but also much more broadly. I think the museums can, for example, play a really important role in helping students who are in… any of the STEM fields see that there is a value to creativity and intuition. So I’m really hoping that I can be a facilitator for those conversations that can infuse creativity into disciplines across campus. The other thing that I’m really looking forward to—that has attracted me to Harvard all along—is the opportunity to work with such an amazing and wide-ranging collection and with such a highly regarded staff. And then of course there’s the beautiful building, and the potential that’s inherent in the way it was designed for teaching and training.
THC: What changes are you hoping to make at the museums? What do you see as the current strengths of the museums?
MT: I think it’s wonderful the way that the vision for the Harvard Art Museums was built right into the building: the sense of transparency, the sense of a building that wants to be activated, the way that wherever you stand in the building you can see people moving through and enjoying the collections, the beautiful study rooms that allow different parts of the collection to come together in dialogue…. For me, it’s less about coming in and making changes than it is about understanding what the potential is for that building. I think that the building really wants us to collaborate, to bring in voices from other disciplines across campus, to bring objects from different times and different geographies into dialogue with each other. I think that at Harvard we finally have a building that is poised to be a kind of laboratory for a 21st century investigation of the visual. My predecessor, Tom Lentz, did a wonderful job working with the architect, Renzo Piano, to envision a great teaching and training museum. I really see my job more as helping to realize that potential.
THC: What are the strengths that you believe you will bring to the museum?
MT: I’ve been at [the Art Institute of Chicago] for more than thirty years. I started as an intern and worked my way up pretty much every rung of the curatorial ladder. So one of my strengths is that I’ve seen the inner workings of a great museum, a museum like Harvard’s, from every different perspective, from every level of curatorial and now senior management positions. I really understand the elements of a well-run museum. I also understand, from having been at every step in the ladder, how critical it is to feel like you’re part of a team…. I’ve learned a lot about team building, and I think that that is one of the strengths that I bring. Another strength is that I have been involved in recent years with two different programs that are meant to address curatorial training. One is trying to diversify the pipeline into museum professions, and the other is trying to prepare graduate students with an education that will include not only very rigorous training in art history but also a deep comfort level with working with objects in museum collections. So I’m bringing with me a real interest in the pedagogical function of the museum and a particular passion right now for the issue of diversity in museums. [The issue of ethnic and racial diversity is] something in which Harvard could play a real leadership role.
THC: What do you anticipate being some of the challenges in your new role?
MT: One of the challenges for me will be learning Harvard, learning how you get things done on a college campus, since I’m not coming from an academic environment. [Harvard will] be an environment in which collaboration, networking, and consensus-building will be very important…. Another challenge is figuring out what the building needs to be sustainable. It’s only been open a little over a year, and I think we’re still finding out what’s costing more to run, what’s costing less to run, what’s working well, what’s working less well. A challenge will be for all of us to stay flexible as the building teaches us what’s possible.
THC: What’s your vision for the role of the Harvard Art Museums on campus?
MT: I like to see the Harvard Art Museums as an organization that in the next few years becomes increasingly inclusive and that increasingly projects a spirit of generosity. I want Harvard students, regardless of what they’re studying, to see the art museums as a…space that can offer them a respite or some fun or a meeting place. Harvard students are under a fair amount of stress, and intellectually they’re being challenged at the highest level. I think that the art museums can both enhance that experience and mitigate it, by offering students a space to explore more informally, to gather and have conversations about big ideas through the lens of perhaps a single object. I’m hoping that more and more of the kinds of exhibitions and programming that we do at the Harvard Art Museums will allow students and our public to learn about all the different disciplines that are taught at Harvard.... I think it’s amazing to look at a particular object, say a textile, and to look at it through the lens of economics and trade and history and art-making and science. There are so many ways to look at a given object, and I think that this can be a microcosm for what’s happening on campus, all these different modes of inquiry. What I’m hoping is that Harvard students will find the museums beckoning to them, with the way that you can learn something by stopping in even for 20 minutes, learn something that broadens your mind and broadens the way that you think, that maybe gives you a more global or more inclusive worldview.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Joshua Bell showcased the elegance of the violin in a superb performance with the Academy of St Martin in the Fields at Boston’s Symphony Hall on Sunday. Performing four wildly different pieces, the world-renowned musician and the chamber orchestra that he directs unleashed both their technical brilliance and emotional exuberance.
As both the music director of and a violinist in the performance, Bell received a huge round of applause the very moment he appeared on stage holding his 1713 Gibson ex-Huberman Stradivarius violin. He contributed to the first violin section of two symphonies, Prokofiev’s Symphony No. 1 and Beethoven’s Symphony No. 8, and led two pieces for violin and orchestra, Tchaikovsky’s Violin Concerto and Schumann’s Elegy for Orchestra. Bell also served as conductor throughout, directing the orchestra with his expressive body movements and his bow. Visibly perspiring before the end of the first piece, Bell’s energy dominated and united the ensemble.
Bell’s performance as an instrumentalist was most impressive in Tchaikovsky’s Violin Concerto. One of the composer’s most renowned pieces, the concerto was famously rejected by violinist Leopold Auer, the piece’s intended dedicatee, for being too technically challenging. For Bell, however, these difficulties provided an opportunity to prove his outstanding skills. He took full advantage of the cadenza in the middle of the first movement, giving a powerful interpretation of this prolonged monologue of melancholy and struggle. The violin’s timbre was captivating, and the shivering high-pitched notes sounded almost like sobs. In the third movement, Bell’s fingers seemed to be flying above the violin, and with each passing second, vastly different sound textures succeeded each other. Bell’s performance exploited the full range of pain, anger, passion, and elegance in Tchaikovsky’s writing.
In Schumann’s Elegy for Orchestra, Bell also stole the show with his delicate interpretation. The short piece was a last-minute substitution for Bach’s Concerto for Two Violins due to a minor injury sustained by violin soloist Pamela Frank, but Bell’s performance sounded as well-rehearsed as it could have possibly been, effortlessly graceful and technically impeccable. Despite its brevity, Bell endowed the piece with a wide range of emotions.
By contrast, the Prokofiev and Beethoven symphonies demonstrated the accord between Bell and the rest of the orchestra. The orchestra did full justice to Prokofiev’s classical, dignified composition. Beethoven’s symphony resounded with joy and power, and the cellos, the brass instruments, and the percussion section gave the piece a weight that the violins alone could not  have achieved. The last movement, the weightiest of the four, drew a wide variety of sounds from all the instruments to form a compelling whole.
Widely celebrated as one of the world’s greatest instrumentalists, Bell showed in Sunday’s concert that he is also a charismatic and talented leader. His work with the Academy of St Martin in the Fields showed both his own and the ensemble’s brilliance. Bell and the orchestra’s performances fully merited the three standing ovations that they received from an enthusiastic audience.

On March 10, Harvard’s Department of Comparative Literature welcomed A.O. Scott ’87-’88 to the Barker Center for a presentation of his new book, “Better Living Through Criticism: How to Think About Art, Pleasure, Beauty, and Truth.” In a speech and a question and answer session, Scott addressed the concept of criticism as a more centered and condensed version of what people experience every day when they look at art.
As a film critic for the New York Times since 2000 and the paper’s chief film critic since 2004, Scott is well-respected in the world of criticism. He has reviewed books for Newsday and has written essays and articles for publications including Slate and the New York Review of Books. In 2010, he was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in criticism. He currently serves as a professor of film criticism at Wesleyan University.
Scott began by musing about what scholars have in common with critics like himself. Scholars analyze texts and works in the many subcategories of art—from English to philosophy to the Romance languages—and explore their cultural and historical context and meaning. Critics like Scott judge, rank, and evaluate these same kinds of art. Indeed, according to Scott, critics and scholars aren’t opposing figures but instead operate in a kind of symbiotic relationship. “I think that critical journalism very often veers toward or rests implicitly on a basis of scholarly interest and concern,” Scott said. “I also think that a great many scholarly careers, maybe most of them, began in the throes of a fan-like enthusiasm, in the argumentative and judgmental and passionate state of enthusiasm that the other kind of criticism—the journalistic, case-based, evaluative kind—exists to serve and to inflame.”
Having graduated from Harvard with a degree in literature, now known as comparative literature, Scott also took on the role of the professor during his speech and had his audience look at two poems: Philip Larkin’s 1953 “Reasons for Attendance” and Frank O’ Hara’s 1960 “Having a Coke With You.” According to Scott, Larkin’s poem discusses art as a distraction from sex, while O’Hara’s is conversely about sex as a distraction from art. “[My] whole book is kind of in [Larkin’s] 20 lines, in that it’s about what happens to us when we encounter this thing called art,” Scott says. “Without making any great claims about ultimate stature or canonical value, it's this thing that we hear that calls us to ourselves. Through its very individuality, through that fact that it isn’t anything other than itself, [it] reminds us that we have a similar kind of integrity and authenticity in ourselves.” The second poem, in contrast, shows the connection between the idea of art—and the beauty, harmony, and excitement that the arts represent—and the idea of love, which passes in between persons. According to Scott, the former may be a substitute for the latter.
Scott then related the poems back to the discussion about criticism. “These poems to me are in a way prefaces to the discussion [about] what criticism can be, because they are discussions about what art is and what it is doing in our lives,” he said. According to Scott, art can come from a great diversity of places, even from everyday events. “What is that? What just happened? What does it mean? Why does it matter? Those are really the fundamental questions of criticism, and I’d like to think that they arise, that they erupt in the midst of everyday life, while we’re doing other things, when we don’t necessarily expect them to confront us,” he said.
Scott concluded with a reflection on his personal definition of a critic’s work. “Criticism above all is a mode of conversation,” Scott said. “It’s the way we have of talking about the very puzzling and pleasurable experience we have with works of art.”

Tender and passionate, romantic and epic, beautiful and destructive, Boston Lyric Opera’s new production of “Werther” gave a powerful interpretation of the archetypal legend of unrequited love. An iteration of French musician Jules Massenet’s 1887 adaptation of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s classic, the performance, which ran March 11 to 20, was BLO’s first rendition of the piece in almost 20 years. What they brought to the stage—elegant and exuberant—was more than worth the wait.
Werther (Alex Richardson), a sensitive and melancholic young poet, falls instantly in love when he meets Charlotte (Sandra Piques Eddy), a beautiful young girl who has just become engaged. While her fiancé is away, Werther becomes a regular visitor to Charlotte and her siblings, for whom she merrily cares after her mother’s early death. Over time, he falls deeper and deeper into the quagmire of love, all the way to the level of madness. Charlotte, while fond of Werther, remains loyal to her fiancé, Albert (John Hancock), whose unexpected return forces the two to stay apart. Much older than both Werther and Charlotte, Albert soon realizes Werther’s special feelings for Charlotte. Understanding the young man’s sentiment, Albert provides emotional support for him. Werther, however, knowing that Albert is the best companion for Charlotte but unable to renounce his love for her, decides to end the love triangle in a violent way.
Since Goethe published “The Sorrows of Young Werther” in 1774, the story between Werther and Charlotte has inspired generations. One of them happened to be Massenet, who immediately decided to adapt the work for opera after a teary read, according to the program notes. The biggest change in the plot is that while the novel is narrated solely from Werther’s perspective, the opera is divided into two parts. In Acts I and II, the audience follows Werther as he falls in love with Charlotte, but in Acts III and IV, Charlotte becomes the lead character after Werther has to leave her; for the first time, the audience gets a glimpse of her reciprocal love for Werther, which she hides from the young poet due to her duty to Albert.
This change of perspective turned out to be extremely successful: Charlotte’s confessions in Act III shone as the highlight of the show. Eddy, who is on the Metropolitan Opera’s roster this year, gave a convincing performance that could melt even a heart made of stone. When she read Werther’s letters in a beautiful, trembling voice, it was not hard to believe, as Albert tells Werther, that any man would fall in love with her. When she finally saw her lover at the end of the act, the couple unleashed their passion in one of the few times in the opera when multiple characters sing together. David Angus, the music director and conductor of Werther, writes that he discovered these vocal lines in Massenet’s original handwritten manuscript and that they may have never been played before—a truly surprising fact, as the brilliant power of this section marked the emotional climax of the show.
BLO also made some interesting innovations with regard to staging and set design. The sumptuous stage featured three big screens that played the faces of characters whenever someone on the stage was missing them. At the beginning of Act III, when Werther’s letters arrived to Charlotte, they spread not only on the floor but also across the screens. Such visual complements externalize the characters’ psychology and expand the show’s emotional power. Similarly, when Charlotte stayed alone in her room thinking about Werther, Werther always stood in the background listening to her whispers, even though he was, in the story, miles away from her. All these made it easier to identify with the characters’ emotions and made the fate of the lovers ever more tragic.
The story of Werther was first told by a German writer; it was adapted by a French musician; it has now been presented by an American opera group to its audience in Boston. Across thousands of miles and hundreds of years, the story was as relatable as ever. BLO’s “Werther” was truly a heartfelt celebration of universal human emotions.

Textiles, meet #techstyle. Running from March 6 through July 10 in the Foster Gallery of the Museum of Fine Arts, the #techstyle exhibition aims to explore the expanding relationship between fashion and technology, along with the implications of that change for both the assembly and use of clothing. Some works on display—a Tweetable dress, a remote-controlled frock, and 3D printed platform shoes—seem drawn straight out of science fiction.
Structurally, the space is divided into three main showrooms: “Production,” “Performance,” and a connecting section that features four pieces from several well-known designers. “Production” highlights the use of technology in physical construction, with works arranged spatially by technique; laser cutting, sustainable practices, 3D printing, and electronics. “Performance” contains garments that are either products of performances or dynamic artistic experiences unto themselves. Throughout the gallery, other forms of visual media—prominently, videos of pieces on the catwalk and behind-the-scenes looks at technical elements—offer additional perspectives on a particular garment’s history, adding to the narrative quality of the exhibition.
Michelle Finamore, co-curator of the exhibition, believes that the value of #techstyle extends beyond pure entertainment. She hopes that the exhibition encourages viewers to consider the interplay between clothing and the modern world in which it operates: How is new technology redefining traditional notions of dress, and in what ways is it expanding the boundaries of design and display? More broadly, what do synergies between high tech and high fashion herald for the future of people’s interactions with their clothing?
The exhibition offers a diverse take on all of these considerations. Drawing from the worlds of wearable tech and haute couture alike, #techstyle features pieces from the runways of iconic fashion houses like Alexander McQueen and Comme des Garçons, the collections of modern-day atelier superstars Viktor&Rolf, and the sewing machines—or rather, 3D printers—of specialty design studios like threeASFOUR. Represented artists hail from all corners of the world. Israeli-born designer Noa Raviv’s digitally rendered “Bodysuit” (2014) stands alongside “Kinematics 8”(2016), a laser-sintered dress created by the Somerville-based Nervous System, the co-founders of which, Jessica Rosenkrantz and Jesse Louis Rosenberg, completed their undergraduate degrees at MIT.
The producers have taken special care to highlight works of local origin, identifying them with a black-and-white “b” symbol on accompanying wall labels. “We thought it was incredibly important to emphasize the Boston connection in the show, because we are a tech hub, and it’s amazing to see how much of what’s happening here is connected to both the national and international fashion worlds,” Finamore said.

In many cases, the introduction of advanced technology has transformed fashion design into a cross-disciplinary process, combining complex mathematical modeling, graphic design, and materials science approaches to fabrics with traditional drawing and tailoring skills. In the making of the main exhibition piece, “Anthozoa cape and skirt, Voltage Collection” (2013), Dutch designer Iris van Herpen worked with Neri Oxman,  professor of media arts and sciences at MIT, to develop novel 3D digital fabrication techniques. The result evokes the texture and appearance of its eponymous life form, a class of marine organisms including coral reefs and sea anemones. “The designers of this piece are very interested in how you can replicate natural processes using technology,” Finamore said. “[One of the difficulties] designers encounter with 3D printing is that it usually requires a hard material, but wearables require much softer, pliable ones. This is one of the first garments to utilize a softer silicon-based printed material.”
Other objects in the exhibition practice a similar mimicry. Nature and natural forms clearly serve as the inspiration for the LED e-broidered “Tuxedo”(2014) by Akris and “The Bird” (2014) from T H E U N S E E N’s recent Air Collection. The latter, a leather cape featuring feathers coated with heat-sensitive dye, recalls the fluid, rhythmic molting of fowl. The vision for “Tuxedo” is drawn from a larger biological system: the cosmos. Dozens of LED lights stitched into the fabric run from the lapels of the jacket down to the pant cuffs. The bulbs, arranged in constellations inspired by Thomas Ruff’s astral photographs, twinkle like little electronic stars. Many of the other works—Bitoni’s “‘Molecule’ Shoe”, Raviv’s “Bodysuit”—also reference the natural order, if not necessarily living elements, vis-à-vis carefully rendered proportions and calculated geometry. Technology and nature often exist in contradiction, but #techstyle explores the interconnectedness of the two realms through the lens of fashion.
#Techstyle also considers those at the opposite end of the production spectrum: wearers. A few pieces directly address the function of a clothing piece or accessory item. Ralph Lauren’s “Ricky Bag with Light” (2015), for instance, includes a light-up interior pocket lining and a built-in phone charger for the truly smartphone-addicted. However, most works are less overt in addressing the user’s role. Issey Miyake’s “132 5. Ensemble” (2012) transforms from a two-dimensional pattern to a theoretically functional purse and dress by folding like origami; Viktor & Rolf’s Wearable Art collection pieces can be removed from the wearer, unraveled, and hung on the wall as art pieces. In any case, whether directly or indirectly, many of the pieces challenge traditional notions of “wearing”.
Much like the clothing itself, the creation of the exhibition gallery involves collaboration across disciplines. Everything from the installation backdrops, black and angled to hide all electrical wiring for minimalism’s sake, to the lighting, illuminated from below and above the piece to achieve a “floating” effect, is meticulously crafted to create a certain ambiance. “The process involves a lot of coordination,” said exhibition designer Chelsea Garunay. “Conservators, carpenters and electricians, designers, curators, videographers… we all work together to create a cohesive experience.”
Through the interaction of exhibition pieces and gallery design, #techstyle aims to create an immersive environment where viewers can explore cutting-edge fashion technologies and consider how clothing, both in its design and its use, is transforming within the digital landscape. “I would love for people to leave with the idea that… a dramatic shift on our lives and lifestyles is happening right now in the fashion world,” Finamore says. The future of fashion is a shifting evolution of construction and interaction, design and display. #techstyle hopes to explore these questions in microcosm—while leaving room for some dress-Tweeting, 3D-printing fun.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What happens when a dysfunctional family’s nest egg disappears almost overnight? Cynthia D'Aprix Sweeney’s hotly anticipated debut work,“The Nest”—the tale of four adult siblings and a trust fund in peril—seeks to answer exactly that question. She will be reading passages from “The Nest” and signing copies of the novel at the Harvard Book Store on Wednesday, March 23. In advance of this event, Sweeney spoke with the Crimson about her writing process, inspiration, and feelings about wealthy New Yorkers.
The Harvard Crimson: “The Nest” revolves around a dysfunctional set of adult siblings. What prompted you to write about family, a tried and true subject for literature, and how did you go about it in a new way?
Cynthia D’Aprix Sweeney: I think that one of the reasons I wanted to write about grown-up siblings is because I grew up in a really Irish and Italian Catholic environment, and everyone around me had lots of siblings. In fact, there were four kids in my family, and I always thought we had a small family because everyone had six or seven or eight or ten kids in their family. I'm just fascinated by adult sibling relationships because they just become increasingly more complicated. How did I go about it in a new and different way? I didn't think about that when I was writing; I had this idea in my head about these four people who wanted to meet for lunch and wanted to have a drink first but didn't want to have a drink with each other…. I had been trying to work on a story about adult siblings, and it wasn't going that well. And as soon as that image popped into my head, I wanted to write that story—about who they were, and why they needed a drink before they got together, and why they couldn't drink in front of one another, and why they were upset with one another.  So once I started answering those questions, the story took on a life that I could follow.
THC: Your novel is set in the world of the New York leisure class. What interested you about that group?
CDS: I lived in NYC for 27 years, and I lived amongst and worked amongst all different kinds of people. When I started the book, I started thinking about the Plumbs and their entitlement that's based on… not much. I was really thinking about the financial crisis of 2008 and how it affected so many people I knew and people in NYC in ways that were curious to observe—in the sense that people were upset because the value of their two million dollar apartment was suddenly maybe a million and a half. This was so shocking for some people that there would be an end to that bubble, and it really wasn't a surprise if you were paying attention. I was trying to capture a little bit of that sense of unearned entitlement and what happens when the bottom falls out and you don't really have the resources to deal with it.
THC: That wouldn't typically make for a very sympathetic portrayal.  Were you interested in making the Plumb family sympathetic to your reader, and how did you try to do that?
CDS: The way I did it was by having empathy for them myself. And I think that if a writer has empathy for characters, then the reader will. And if the writer has contempt for characters, the reader will. I think that unsympathetic characters behaving badly that you can have empathy for, to me, is the most interesting combination and the most satisfying for a reader.  And the way I did that was by learning to love them. But when I got through with the first draft and I looked back on it, I remember thinking that some of the characters were flat on the page, and those were some of the ones I was more interested in skewering than anything else. And I knew that what I had to do was make them vulnerable in some way and that by exploring their vulnerability I would have empathy for them. And then they would become a little more complicated on the page, and that would be a better approach.
THC: Your novel has been described as "cinematic."  Do you see a movie in the making?  Would you be in favor of one?
CDS: Well, it would depend, but there is some discussion about that going on.  If the right person steps up, sure.
THC: Do you have any advice for aspiring writers of fiction?
CDS: Writing is a really solitary pursuit, so I think that it is really important to find community, and then I think it's important to listen to other writers talk about what works for them, but everyone has a different approach. I think you have to write a lot, and you have to figure out which of all the advice that you hear resonates with you and might be helpful for you.  But I think you just have to do the work—you have to put in the hours—and that's the only trick. Sometimes when you're writing, especially when you're working on a longer project like a novel, you can get hung up on whether or not you've had a productive day based on how many words you've written. And I try to remind myself all the time that even if all I've done all day is sit in my office chair… and try and figure out how to write the next few pages or figure out what was wrong with the pages I don't like, then that's working. Thinking is working. Reading is working. As long as you have your brain involved in the project, you're working, but you need to make some kind of silence and space around that to really let yourself concentrate. That's where the good stuff is; it comes to you in those times when you turn off the internet or put your phone in another room and let yourself focus without distraction on what's in front of you.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yep, I said it. As I wrote in a previous article, I have believed for a while now that Donald Trump stands a very good chance of becoming the next President of the United States. As difficult as it is to believe on this campus, and college campuses nationwide, a critical mass of the rest of the national population simply does not see the world the way that we do. In our formative years of development, we saw a black man win the national presidential election under the slogan, “Yes We Can,” and we assumed that these words were the dawn of an entirely new era of American society. Out with the old, in with the new. New technology, new race relations, new marriage laws, new everything. New is better, new is the future.
And while as we’ve gotten older our generation has adapted to every new development, other folks, especially in economically disconnected areas, just don’t see things this way. In fact, their lives are hurting. They like the way the world used to be. As a result, our nation is faced with a populist, anti-establishment backlash, led by a man who shows fascist tendencies in the things that he says and the way that he says them. There is a very real chance that Trump will win. And, believe it or not, I am grateful for this.
Now, if you’ve read my other articles, this statement might surprise you. Frankly, I’m terrified of Trump, and believe that he is one of the greatest threats to American society that we’ve seen in generations. I believe in Obama’s America, at least what it promises in terms of race relations, and I believe that it is our duty as young leaders to fight for equality of opportunity regardless of race, gender, class of birth, or sexual affiliation. So, then, why do I thank God for Donald J. Trump?
Because I believe that Donald Trump is exactly what our generation (especially white liberals) needs to wake up from our state of complacency. By representing intolerance, bigotry and racism, Donald Trump and his immense success show us that all of the progress generations of activists have fought for can be swiped away in an instant if our generation does not stand up and fight back. Unless our generation stands up, speaks out, and, crucially, votes, then we can get ready to inaugurate the 45th president of the United States: Donald J. Trump. And he is only the beginning.
Now, as I’ve detailed more extensively in a previous piece, Donald Trump has said and done a lot of awful, terrible things, but he has also done some positive ones.  First and foremost, he has exposed the slimy underbelly of the Republican Party, which has been playing with fire for far too long, employing political tactics to keep the poor and uneducated in their place (including within their own party) while the rich prosper. Well, in 2016, the political chimera that is the Republican Party will finally split apart based on class lines, and we have Donald Trump to thank for that.
We also have Donald Trump to thank for another, harder truth, especially at this university: While globalization and the information age revolution sound wonderful in theory, in practice they can have enormously disruptive effects on society. The jobs that we outsource, which build upon corporate profits, are American peoples’ livelihoods. These social effects of globalization render a democratic system such as ours susceptible to populist backlash from economically disaffected groups, the “economic losers.”
This is a particularly important lesson at a school like Harvard, where the elite are formed. As future world leaders, it is important to think about the consequences of our actions besides our own personal gain. It is dangerous to blindly ride the wave of technological innovation and progress if it means that we as the future elite neglect the needs and demands of society as a whole. It’s time for us to realize that in a system defined by increased income disparity, there are going to be more losers than winners. If we, the elite, continue to think only of reaping the gains of technological progress without thinking of the rest of society’s material wellbeing, we will leave our nation particularly vulnerable to demagogues such as Donald Trump in the future. And yet, Trump’s dangerous appeal to the disenchanted economic “losers” is exactly the threat we need to motivate us to work together to build a better society.
Hopefully it’s not too late, but if we are too complacent and fail to stand up to and vote against Trump, then our American society will take an enormous step backwards. Still, I believe in our generation, and progressives in all generations, and I believe that we will stand up to Trump’s appeals to fear and tribalism and ensure that he does not take office. And ultimately, I am hopeful the threat posed by Trump and people like him will make our generation, and our school, recognize the danger posed by blindly pursuing technological progress at the expense of the livelihood of the American people. And, for these reasons, I thank God for Donald J. Trump.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you have attended any race-related protest or rally last semester, you may have noticed that Kendrick Lamar’s “Alright” has become something of the rallying cry du jour. Just before Spring Break, the Harvard Hip Hop Archives inducted Kendrick's album “To Pimp a Butterfly” into its Hall of Fame. Black Lives Matter protests and campus solidarity marches alike have been fueled by the triumphant declaration of eventual salvation. Watching crowds of emotionally overwhelmed college students come together in the haze of Lamar’s words during Harvard’s solidarity march with Tufts truly touched me. But even so, it makes me wonder if we may have missed some of Kendrick’s larger message by using the song in this way.   
The power of the song cannot be ignored. From the opening bars, an enchanting beat lures the listener, leaving no hope of escape. Kendrick weaves a narrative of pain and suffering with the distinct potential outcome that salvation may indeed come. The song radiates a type of hope that acknowledges a long history of degradation and marginalization by the powers that be. This potent combination makes “Alright” one of the best-suited popular songs to double as the protest anthem of our time, especially considering growing tensions between the black community and law enforcement across the country.
Despite the uplifting message in “Alright," “To Pimp a Butterfly” has a much darker tint on the whole. Much of the album not only takes a critical look at injustice in America with a somewhat defeatist slant, but it also displays Kendrick’s brutally honest introspection. In "u,” Kendrick mercilessly turns the mirror on himself as he rips apart the layers of his pathology related to his struggles with fame in particular. While this darkness gives birth to “Alright,” it also gives the entire project a purposefully dark air.
Though “Alright” may successfully unify and energize a larger movement, I wonder if removing it from the context of the album denotes shortcomings in the current movement. I do not say this to argue that protesters should look for another hook to chant as they assemble, but rather that they must introduce a similarly dark, complex context to the protest movement that “To Pimp a Butterfly” gives its songs.
As of now, the Black Lives Matter movement on campuses across the country and beyond seems more like a cathartic experience than an agent of political or social change. Yes, some isolated instances of protest have seen greater tangible progress than most. The students at the University of Missouri, for example, managed to oust their President, but this came only after the financial impact of a threatened football game forfeit and other extenuating factors came into play. General student protests alone have produced little tangible results beyond discord and emotional release.
Catharsis, to be clear, is a perfectly valid reason for peaceful assembly. Personally, I fully empathize with the minority college student that feels a need to release some tension caused by the constant reminder of your minority status in a predominately white institution. But if we want to precipitate real change, we must take the affirmative steps necessary to do so. Change will not come without organization outside of the college campus and beyond the protest space. This does not mean students should stop protesting, but rather that students should understand the real macro impact, or lack thereof, of what they are doing.
To this point, the protest movement seems to lack the level of self-awareness and internal critique that Kendrick possesses. “Alright” would not have the same inspirational power if it came without “u”. I can only speak directly about the black community, where I see a real problem. Pointedly parsing out weaknesses and faults of the movement, such as the uneven public representation of women and the LGBT community, only makes it stronger in the long run, but this has been largely absent from much of the internal campus protest dialogue. While no one should lose track of the larger goal at hand, taking time to complicate and interrogate the internal shortcomings of the movement by the activists themselves allows for a self-realization of a larger end of equality.

In recent weeks and months, the issue of marijuana legalization has become the focus of debate on Beacon Hill. In November, Massachusetts voters will likely vote on a referendum that would legalize the use, cultivation, and distribution of marijuana, and most of the Commonwealth’s political leadership is arraying itself against the measure. Most notably, Governor Charlie D. Baker '79, Attorney General Maura T. Healey '92, and Boston Mayor Marty J. Walsh co-authored an op-ed in the Boston Globe arguing against legalization, while a special committee of the state senate released a report two weeks ago that argues for the imposition of certain limits if marijuana is legalized.
Though we recognize that full legalization of marijuana presents some thorny issues for lawmakers to address, it is difficult to say the same for further decriminalizing cannabis possession. Despite a 2008 referendum decriminalizing possession of one ounce or less of the drug, offenders are still subject to civil penalties, and about one thousand people are arrested each year for possession of larger amounts.  These arrests are unnecessary, diverting law enforcement resources from serious crimes and perpetuating a punitive suite of drug policies that make little sense given efforts to reduce the prison population and move away from law enforcement centered solutions to drug crimes. Continuing to phase out penalties for possession of marijuana would be a logical extension of current policy.
Despite the clear benefits of further decriminalization, the case for full legalization is not as clear-cut. Eight state senators who visited Colorado in January to assess that state’s experience brought back several concerns about a legalized marijuana industry and its public health implications for which there are no immediately obvious answers. For example, law enforcement has struggled to develop clear protocols for identifying drivers who are under the influence of marijuana, since simple tools akin to breathalyzers do not yet exist. They also struggle to identify the potency of edible marijuana products.
These concerns deserve a full and public airing before Massachusetts voters make a final decision on legalization. Just because these issues exist, however, does not mean that legalization presents insuperable hurdles. As we learn more about the effects of legalization, more and better steps can be taken to minimize its adverse consequences, in the same way that new methods have been developed to combat alcohol abuse by minors and drunk driving. In particular, lawmakers should be prepared for the immediate implementation of a comprehensive regulatory regime should the legalization referendum pass. These regulations could follow the general outlines of the special committee report issued earlier this month,  which called for a clear definition of impaired driving and better warning labels on marijuana products, and should also include resources for developing enforcement techniques funded through taxes on the industry.
Ultimately, Massachusetts has a unique opportunity to engage in a full-fledged debate based on the experiences of states like Colorado. The November referendum should serve as a timely occasion to develop both a better understanding of the impacts of legalized marijuana and a model set of laws and regulations for this pressing public health and criminal justice issue.

The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences continued to steadily increase Ph.D. student stipends, which have climbed annually by at least three percent for the past six years.
The new minimum stipend for a Ph.D. student in the 2016-2017 academic year is $33,120, with $27,600 distributed during the 10-month academic term and $5,520 for summer funding. For the 2015-2016 academic year, the 10-month stipend was $26,800, according to Dean for Administration and Finance Allen Aloise. 
Harvard’s Ph.D. stipends remain on par with those of its peer institutions. Columbia’s graduate student stipend for this nine-month academic year was $26,286. Princeton’s first-year fellowship stipend was $26,450 for a 10-month period.
“When determining the stipend each year, GSAS balances a host of factors as it prepares its financial aid budget, which also includes tuition grants, health insurance, and other benefits and services,” Aloise wrote in an email.
The new $27,600 rate accommodates the 10-month standard living budget that the GSAS Office of Admissions and Financial Aid has estimated. The office estimated  the typical unmarried student would need $27,350 during this school year, with $15,000 going to housing.
According to the cost of living index provided by the research firm Sperling’s Best Places, Cambridge’s score is 183, in comparison to a national average of 100. Meanwhile, New York City scored 168, and Princeton, N.J., scored 162. Cambridge remains behind Palo Alto, Calif., which stands at 415 on the index.
However, some peer institutions subsidize housing for graduate students, while Harvard does not. Many graduate students say they have struggled to find affordable housing in the Cambridge area, and are oftentimes forced to move far from campus.
Robert Silverman, a professor at the University of Buffalo and an expert on affordable housing, described Boston and Cambridge as “tight” housing markets comparable to San Francisco and parts of Manhattan because students and University employees vie for housing alongside city residents.
“One of the things our research has been finding is that affordable housing outcomes are better in places where universities agree to link its development and other community benefits to their expansion projects,” Silverman wrote in an email.
Silverman also touched on the different needs of graduate students and city residents when a university expands into a new neighborhood, as Harvard is currently doing in Allston.
“Generally, decisions about affordable housing need to be made proactively and in the early stages of the university expansion process,” Silverman wrote. In late January, affordable housing units built on Harvard-owned land in Allston and leased to a developer by the University were distributed by lottery.
Harvard Ph.D. candidate Zachary B. Nowak, who said he uses his stipend primarily for rent, said the increase is “wonderful.” However, he expressed doubt about how much a three percent increase will help.
“Whether or not it keeps up with the inflation in the housing market in Cambridge and the surrounding areas, I’m not sure. Or the inflation in childcare,” Nowak said. “Those are completely different issues that a three percent increase may or may not address.”
Nowak supports the effort by graduate students to unionize. He said collective bargaining is the only way to ensure students have “a seat at the table for decisions like this.”
“We’re psyched about it, [but] it needs to be in the context of collective bargaining,” Nowak said.
GSAS administrators maintained that they weigh student input in its decisions.
“GSAS speaks regularly with students about their priorities, and stipends are one of many benefits and services provided to them,” Aloise wrote in an email.

UPDATED: March 22, 2016, at 12:01 a.m.
When the Undergraduate Council convened for its first meeting of the year in January, Student Life Committee Chair Berkeley Brown ’18 laid out one of her primary objectives: increasing campus accessibility.
“We have some really big projects this semester,” Brown said during the meeting. “Number one is making campus more accessible, making resources for people with disabilities more known, [and] making strides for gender-neutral bathrooms on campus.”
Since that meeting, the UC’s Student Life Committee has focused on increasing accessibility in a variety of areas, from gender-neutral bathrooms to printing. 
Although the College has added some gender-neutral restrooms in recent years, including several in Adams House last September, several students said they feel that progress is inadequate, according to Queer Students and Allies Co-Chair Ted G. Waechter ’18.
“Generally, Harvard is a really tough place for queer and trans students,” Waechter said. “There is an extremely insufficient number of gender-neutral restrooms. Although some of the Houses have started adding gender-neutral restrooms, there still really aren’t enough in residential areas.”
“There’s no reason why a single stall bathroom shouldn’t be a gender-neutral bathroom,” Waechter, a Crimson Editorial writer, added.
In addition to expanding access to gender-neutral restrooms during House renovations, Waechter said the College should also more actively publicize the locations of such restrooms. Brown said the UC “found that there’s no real database anywhere that says where gender-neutral bathrooms are.”
According to Brown, the Student Life Committee is working on gathering information about gender-neutral bathrooms on campus, with the eventual objective of making the information more publicly accessible to students.
“Our goal is to have a list, or maybe someday an integrated map with the Harvard map that says ‘These are where the gender-neutral bathrooms are,’” Brown said.
Student Life Committee member Scott Xiao ’19 also suggested that improving signage on and near gender-neutral bathrooms could help improve student awareness.
Although the UC has pushed for increased access to gender-neutral restrooms since the beginning of the semester, Xiao said the recent destruction of a gender-neutral bathroom sign in Eliot House—an act which Eliot House Faculty Dean Gail O’Keefe called “vandalism”—proved particularly concerning.
In addition to working on gender-neutral bathrooms, the Student Life Committee is also planning other projects to improve accessibility on campus. In particular, the committee is working on an initiative to make student organization leaders more aware of which rooms are accessible.
“If you have common rooms, some of them are accessible, some of them aren’t,” Xiao said. “When you have student leaders planning events, they need to know if a common room is accessible or not to take that into account.”
According to Brown, the committee is coordinating with building administrators and the Harvard College Disability Alliance to identify which rooms are accessible. Eventually, her plan is to put information about the accessible rooms on RoomBook, the online system through which student organizations can reserve rooms for meetings.
“Our goal is to make sure that when people are planning events [or] booking rooms, that this is at the forefront of their minds,” Brown said.
“Everybody wants meetings or events to be as accessible as possible,” Xiao said. “The main issue right now is that it’s hard to find that information.”
Xiao, who is also a member of the Freshman Class Committee, pointed to the six new printers in freshmen dorm buildings and a laundry room that will be constructed in Matthews this summer as instances where the UC has succeeded at improving accessibility.
The Student Life Committee is also considering various other accessibility-related projects, including plans to improve the affordability of printing and laundry services on campus, according to Xiao.
The UC cancelled its regularly scheduled meeting this week; Brown said she will update the entire Council on her committee’s projects on Sunday.

These days, Ron K. Unz ’83 spends a lot of his time collecting signatures and launching campaigns.
Unz, a controversial outsider candidate for Harvard’s Board of Overseers, is setting his sights on an even more prestigious governing body: the United States Senate.
In what he called a “last-minute decision,” Unz delivered his petitions—bearing the requisite 65 signatures—to run for the seat vacated by retiring California Senator Barbara L. Boxer last Wednesday, the last possible day to file a candidacy. Unz acknowledged his campaign is a “hopeless effort” in the traditionally blue state: A Republican has not represented California in the Senate since 1992.
“My getting into this race in California was just as surprising to me as it was to everybody else,” Unz said. “In the case of the Harvard Overseers campaign, I’d really been thinking about it and planning it for eight or nine months before I launched the effort. In this case, it was probably about a week ago, maybe 10 days ago that I started thinking about it.”
In both his campaigns, Unz appears to be more focused on highlighting niche issues rather than charting a path to victory. In an essay announcing his candidacy, Unz admitted that he is a “tremendous longshot” and “rather likely to lose,” saying said he will only accept donations of $99 or less to fund his endeavors.
Unz grabbed Harvard headlines in January when he declared his candidacy for the Board of Overseers, the University’s second-highest administrative body. Running on a controversial platform, he wants Harvard to release more data about undergraduate admissions and make tuition free. Joined by four like-minded alumni, including five-time presidential candidate Ralph Nader, Unz obtained the required 201 signatures for his “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” slate to appear on the upcoming ballot and took a red-eye flight from Palo Alto to deliver the petitions in person.
Unz said he will focus his Senate run on preventing bilingual education in California public schools, attacking a ballot initiative to overturn a 1998 proposition mandating that schools teach solely in English. Unz played a role in passing that proposition in the first place, and he plans to use his campaign to defend it. He also wants to critique the cost of tuition in the University of California system: “It’s absurd how much money they spend,” he said.
But Jeannie Park ’83, a founder of an alumni group formed to oppose the “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” campaign, assailed Unz’s Senate bid as another gratuitous attack on diversity.
“Ron Unz's Senate run... shows again that he is committed to erecting walls against the kind of global, diverse, multicultural and inclusive society that Harvard is preparing its students to live in and lead,” Park wrote in a text message.
Unz, who made his fortune writing software, will take on establishment Republicans Duf Sundheim and Tom Del Beccaro in the June 7 primary, and may face an even steeper battle against the Democratic nominee in the November general election.
“Given that I’ll be saying some things and taking some positions that very few candidates ever do, donors can mentally budget their $99 contributions as providing a bit of ‘ideological entertainment value,’” Unz wrote.
Unz and his “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” compatriots have met rebuke from Harvard administrators, alumni, and other Overseers candidates for their positions, which some have condemned as impractical and antithetical to diversity. Unz, along with three other members of the slate, have publicly opposed affirmative action and the consideration of race in college admissions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

In a sprawling and frequently introspective conversation, University President Drew G. Faust and her younger brother Donald Gilpin espoused the virtues of a liberal arts education and reflected on their time growing up together at an Askwith Forum Monday.
The forum, moderated by James E. Ryan, Dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, covered topics ranging from the siblings’ upbringing in rural Virginia to the role of the arts and humanities in education.
Ryan opened the forum by asking the siblings to introduce one another, provoking Gilpin—a retired high school English and drama teacher—to launch into what he jokingly called a “psychobiography” of his older sister. As the only daughter in a family of four children, Faust “had to learn the hard way how to deal with difficult males,” Gilpin said.
“She wanted to fix the family dynamic, which was flawed. She wanted to fix sexism, she wanted to fix racism, she wanted to fix social inequality,” Gilpin said.
“Goodness,” Faust said quietly as Gilpin lavished praise on her.
Gilpin added that a number of “powerful, principled, strong women” in Faust’s life, including their mother and accomplished women professors at Bryn Mawr College, Faust’s alma mater, helped shape her into the person she is today.
On the other hand, Faust said her brother’s experiences taking time off during his undergraduate career at Princeton to teach in Labrador, Canada, fueled his interest in teaching, a profession in which he worked 41 years before retiring.  In addition to his work ethic, Faust said she thought two other qualities of Gilpin particularly stood out.
“There were two parts of what made him a great teacher: He loved the kids, and he loved what he was teaching to the kids,” Faust said.
Asked what advice she would give to the current crop of presidential candidates, Faust criticized former Republican contender Marco Rubio’s debate comment that the country would benefit from training more blue collar workers and fewer “philosophers.”
“Why can’t we have philosophers, and plumbers, and plumbers who are philosophers?” Faust said.
Both Faust and Gilpin also championed the arts at length, with Faust praising the University’s recently-debuted Theater, Dance, and Media concentration. Faust said she will defend the value of the humanities at the United States Military Academy at West Point on Thursday.
In the question and answer portion of the forum, Abigail Weil, a Ph.D. candidate and leader in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences unionization movement, asked Faust whether she believed graduate students should be permitted to collectively bargain. Faust, reiterating her public stance against the campaign, said she disapproves of unionization efforts that would warp the relationship between graduate students and faculty, but acknowledged “the students have the right to try to organize, to have an election.”
Weil said she was encouraged by Faust’s response, which she saw as somewhat more conciliatory compared to Faust’s past criticisms of the unionization movement.
“We are pushing on the administration to pledge neutrality, so even though President Faust repeated her own anti-union views, she did end her response by saying that if we want to organize and form a unit, we’re free to do so,”  Weil said after the event. “We hope that we can turn that into an official pledge of neutrality from the administration.”
Ending the forum on a nostalgic note, Gilpin explained what he thought every teacher should understand before entering the profession.
“You need to enjoy what you’re doing,” he said.  “I think you really need to love the field, the subject matter, and you need to love the interaction with the students.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh C. Johnson discussed both immigration and counterterrorism at the Institute of Politics’ John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Monday.

Johnson spoke in front of a forum packed with students, visitors, and Secret Service agents. Graham T. Allison, director of the Belfer Center, moderated his address.
Johnson, who has been Secretary of Homeland Security since 2013, said he has focused on efforts to counter violent extremism during his tenure.
“One of the things we’re doing,” he said, is “to build bridges to the American Muslim communities to help them… counter the appeal of the Islamic State.”
“It’s a Homeland Security imperative that we enhance and expand upon our [counter-extremism] mission,” he said.
Johnson also spoke at length about immigration, including recent influxes of migrants from Latin America and refugees from the Middle East. He described it as “the hardest issue [he] has worked on in the government.”
Johnson has been public in his stance against barring all refugees into the United States, instead insisting the United States concentrate on “building bridges” with Muslims around the country.
He noted that the only time he became involved in the current presidential campaign was when Republican frontrunner Donald J. Trump insisted on banning all Muslims from entering the United States.
“Not only is it wrong, it is contrary to our Homeland Security interests,” he said of Trump’s plan.
Dominique A. Gilbert, a student at the Kennedy School, said she favored Johnson’s stance.
“I like that it is proactive. It’s the best long-term approach,” she said.
In an interview prior to the talk, Johnson also lambasted the plan put forth by several Republican candidates to deport all undocumented persons.
“It’s not wise, and it’s not possible… more than half of that population has been here for more than ten years,” he said. “They have become integrated members of the country, many of them have children, they live and work among us.”
Johnson also spoke about the Department's counterterrorism efforts in what he characterized as a “new phase of the global terrorism threat” with an increased risk of domestic terrorism.
“We’re on defense a lot,” Johnson said, denying that the Department of Homeland Security only reacts to past terrorist attacks. “What I preach to our folks is that we have to respond to the next terrorist attack, not the last one.”
Johnson emphasized that much of the work that Homeland Security does is behind the scenes, which may contribute to the public’s perception of the Department.
“The public doesn’t hear about all the extraordinary things that go toward keeping the homeland safe,” he said. “I think if more people knew about what our people do on behalf of the American public, on behalf of the taxpayer, you would be extraordinarily proud and impressed.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A week after Harvard Law School’s seal change became final, a group of faculty members are publicly speaking out in support of Law School Dean Martha L. Minow, charging that student activists at the school have not given her due credit for her efforts to address racial issues on campus.
Seven Law School faculty members—Glenn Cohen,  Randall L. Kennedy, Richard J.  Lazarus, Todd D. Rakoff, Carol S. Steiker, Kristen A. Stilt, and David B. Wilkins—published an open letter in the Harvard Law Record Monday defending Minow.
They wrote, “Our goal here is… to express our support and deep appreciation for Dean Minow and all that she has done during this difficult and important process, and to advance the cause of justice throughout her long and distinguished career.”
The Law School has been grappling with racial tension on campus since the fall, and Minow herself has been the subject of both scrutiny and praise. After a racially-charged incident of vandalism in November, a coalition of students formed the group Reclaim Harvard Law, demanding Minow take steps to improve treatment of minorities and intensifying appeals to change the school’s controversial seal, which has ties to slavery.
In response, Minow created a committee to reconsider the seal, and that committee released a report to the Harvard Corporation in early March recommending its removal. Last week, the Corporation granted the Law School permission to change the seal, and the process to remove it is currently underway.
Since November, Minow has also pledged to hire more minority faculty members, make changes to orientation programming for incoming students, and administer a campus-wide climate survey related to diversity.
However, activists remain vocal critics of the dean. In February, they interrupted an awards ceremony at Brandeis University honoring Minow’s scholarship on race and divided societies, calling the prize “a hypocrisy.” When some condemned the protest, Reclaim Harvard Law member Alexander J. Clayborne authored an op-ed in the Record defending the activists’ critiques of Minow.
“Our critics seem to think that we are unaware of Dean Minow’s scholarship and her contributions to the legal field in advancing the causes of gender and racial equality,” he wrote. “Yet we did not protest in ignorance. Indeed, we protested precisely because we are intimately acquainted with her work.”
While activists welcomed the seal change, they are still pushing for the remainder of their demands—including establishing a critical race theory program—and their reproofs of Minow continue.
Some faculty members, however, defend Minow particularly in light of her role in the seal change process.  While they wrote in their open letter that they support Reclaim Harvard Law’s goals, the professors call activists’ criticisms of Minow “exaggerated and unfair.”
“We believe that it is both wrong and counterproductive that some members of the Reclaim Harvard Law School movement and other individuals and organizations have singled Dean Minow out for such sharp and unfair criticism,” the professors wrote.
Pointing to Minow’s actions on changing the seal and to her own scholarship on race, they argue the dean deserves more credit.
“We are proud of the goals of Reclaim Harvard Law School and of the student activism spurring Harvard Law to become a better place. But we are also very proud of our Dean, her work on behalf of the entire law school community, including her thoughtful and good faith efforts to respond to the important issues Reclaim has raised,” they wrote. “We respectfully submit that the members of Reclaim Harvard Law School and the students who support them should be so as well.”
Minow, members of Reclaim Harvard Law, and several faculty signatories of the open letter declined to comment

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The vibrant pink and zebra-patterned wallpaper that lined local restaurant UpStairs on the Square until its closing in 2013 has been replaced by the minimalist white walls of Parsnip, fitting for the ambience the new Harvard Square restaurant exudes.
Parsnip opened its doors last November with a farm-to-table menu centered on local ingredients, in stark contrast to UpStairs on the Square’s unconventional menu. Nevertheless, Parsnip is attempting to pay homage to the former local favorite.

“UpStairs on the Square was a Harvard Square staple,” Jenny Severin, Parsnip’s Food and Beverage Manager, said. “It was funky and I think Parsnip definitely pays homage to the space.”
According to Severin, Parsnip aims to simultaneously create a relaxed and refined environment for its customers, while highlighting the artisanal food prepared by Executive Chef Peter Quinion.
Quinion hails from England and began his careers in English kitchens, and he described the food served at Parsnip as Anglo-American.
“American food to be honest is very similar to the food in England,” he said.
Parsnip’s menu “follows the seasons” and rarely uses ingredients from anywhere outside Massachusetts, Quinion said.
“What has inspired the food at Parsnip are the supplies that I use, which are direct from our suppliers and the people that grow for us,” Quinion said. “We have farmers who grow our chickens to a specific size and weight.”
While the restaurant is relatively new to the neighborhood, it has already attracted a wide ranging clientele—Severin said the restaurant has been frequented by multiple Harvard Deans, University President Drew G. Faust, and Hasty Pudding’s Woman of the Year and award-winning actress Kerry Washington.
It has also become popular among locals, Severin said, citing Cambridge residents' appreciation for globally inspired foods and the farm to table concept. Harvard Square has long been a leader in the local food movement. Severin said the restaurant has seen success in attracting both older and younger customers, with students particularly enjoying Parsnip’s upstairs lounge later in the evening.
“It is exactly the place students want to be with the fireplaces, the ambience, and the color,” Severin said. “Once they have had dinner here, they move to the lounge upstairs which has sort of a more chilled out space.”
Parsnip is owned by Hong Kong billionaire and record-setting Harvard donor Gerald Chan, who has purchased more than $100 million worth of real estate in Harvard Square over the past few years.
“The dining room is almost an extension of the owner’s living space,” Quinion said. “He does business here and greets friend here.”
Although Parsnip is less than a year old, its staff have large aspirations.
“We want to grow the business,” Severin said. “We know there are some places here in the Square that have been staples and we want to become a staple in the Square.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 22, 2016 at 2:30 a.m.
­No one likes a post hoc prediction.
But considering post hoc is just short for postseason hockey, I’m going to make one anyway.
To get you up to speed, the No. 1/1 Quinnipiac men’s hockey team dethroned Harvard as champion of the ECAC on Saturday, knocking off the No. 10/9 Crimson by a 4-1 margin at Herb Brooks Arena in Lake Placid, N.Y.
Yes, “the” Herb Brooks Arena. Right under the roof where Johnson and Eruzione became household names one fateful night in February of 1980. And where names like Vesey and Blackwell capped an improbable championship run of their own 35 years later.
Last season, after overcoming a midseason crisis of massive proportions, sixth-seeded Harvard knocked off Quinnipiac, then Colgate, at the world-famous rink to secure the 2015 ECAC championship—the ninth in program history.
This year, however, the Crimson was stopped in its tracks by an opponent that arrived in New York’s hockey paradise just as hot as Harvard was a season ago. The only difference between the two championship-winning squads? The Crimson had to rally for trophy season. The Bobcats started hot, they continued hot, and they finished hot.
Quinnipiac is the best team in the ECAC. Plain and simple. Sure, the Crimson has the talent to beat the Bobcats on any given night, but Harvard’s resume pales in comparison to that of the boys from Hamden, Conn. Offense, defense, power play, penalty kill—you name it; each respective Quinnipiac unit ranks among the top six in the nation.
The Bobcats deserved to lift that Whitelaw Cup. And that’s why I picked them.
Now hold your fire. Forget for just a second how detestable a mode of journalism it is to publicize your picks retroactively, then proceed to write about being correct. After all, I’m no clairvoyant. If I was, Denzel Valentine and the Michigan State Spartans would be cutting down the nets in just a few weeks’ time.
The point is, I’m not writing this column to boast about being right, even if that’s an area where you might expect your stereotypical Harvard student journalist to specialize. After all, picking a team with a 29-3-7 record to win a game is a far cry from a hot take. If you ask me, it’s not even lukewarm.
But regardless of where the mercury stops on your theoretical thermometer, it’s a take nonetheless—one that wound up being right for all the wrong reasons.
Here’s where I went wrong: I thought the Quinnipiac offense was ready to explode on Saturday. In fact, I was fully convinced.
Everyone and their mother have seemed to scrutinize the Bobcats at one point or another for their lack of success in the ECAC postseason over the years. Despite sustained regular season success, Quinnipiac entered this year with just one appearance in the conference championship game since joining the league in 2005.
As the top seed in the conference, the Bobcats had a prime chance to get there last year. Standing in their way, however, was the Crimson, who rolled into the final with heads held high after connecting three times in the opening period in Lake Placid. All the more reason why an even stronger Quinnipiac team felt poised to strike on Saturday.
And three days ago, I would have told you the Harvard blue line wasn’t ready for the Quinnipiac storm that was brewing. The state of the Crimson blue line at this stage of the season? Not great. 6’7” big man Wiley Sherman suffered an upper body injury in the ECAC quarterfinals that knocked him out of the tournament. His replacement, sophomore Thomas Aiken, gives up about a foot, as he’s listed at 5’8”.
Nonetheless, optimism emanated from the arena Friday night. With big skates to fill, Aiken held his own in the semifinals against St. Lawrence, as did the rest of his companions in the back. In fact, if it weren’t for Clay Anderson’s late-game gaffe, Harvard probably would have pitched a shutout.
Optimism alone was never going to beat the Bobcats, however. All signs pointed to a big night for the Quinnipiac attack, and surely enough, the final score line provided no reason to blink.
But somehow, even in a 4-1 defeat, the Crimson defensive unit exceeded expectations. Harvard held the Bobcats to 25 shots—10 below Quinnipiac’s season average—and was never beat at full strength, winning that battle, 1-0.
What did the Crimson in was special teams. The Bobcats struck three times on the power play with penalty-killers Sean Malone and Luke Esposito missing from the ice for long stretches of time, the former a gametime scratch and the latter the culprit who put Harvard in the hole in the first place. As for Quinnipiac’s fourth goal? An empty-netter.
Would the game have been different had the Bobcats not piled on three consecutive goals in the second period? Of course. Had the game remained 0-0 for a while, would Quinnipiac have eventually solved the Crimson defense at full strength? Probably.
But what-ifs are useless, almost as much as post hoc predictions. My final two conclusions stem only from the 60 minutes of hockey that 4,626 people got to watch at Herb Brooks.
Harvard’s defense might be alright after all. And Quinnipiac finally has the trophy it deserves.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s tennis team ended its spring break in Los Angeles with a win over a ranked opponent to cap off an impressive run. The Crimson swept its three games this weekend to remain undefeated in March, extending its win streak to five games.
Harvard managed to best Loyola Marymount and UC Santa Barbara by one point, and No. 24 Fresno State by two.
HARVARD 4, LOYOLA MARYMOUNT 3
Harvard got the break started in Los Angeles against the Lions. Loyola Marymount (4-7) had hosted its last three coming into the contest. But the team has struggled in the LMU tennis center, racking up just two wins and four defeats. These woes continued into its tilt with the Crimson.
Harvard got off to a strong start with the pair of sophomore Annika Ringblom and freshman Sabrina Xiong and the duo of sophomore Nikki Kallenberg and junior June Lee winning their respective matches to secure the doubles point.
Singles went back and forth with neither team able to gain an advantage. It was the bottom of the ladder that came through for the Crimson. Of the top four seeds, only Kallenberg was victorious. Xiong and captain Amy He won the matches at the bottom two seeds to force a split of the six singles matches, with the doubles victory securing the match for Harvard.
HARVARD 4, UCSB 3
The Crimson headed north for its matchup against UCSB. Despite the fact that the Gauchos (6-6) came into the match playing in great form having won five of its last six, the Crimson would add its second win of its California road trip.
The doubles point went to the Gauchos as Harvard’s women were swept 3-0. However, the Crimson would recover to claim victory in four of the next six singles matches with the bottom half of the ladder again performing well. Four of the six matches were won in the final third set.
Freshman Erica Oosterhout and Ringblom would win their singles matches to get the Crimson halfway to victory. For the second time in just days, Xiong and He all won their individual contests to get Harvard over the hump.
HARVARD 4, FRESNO STATE 2
Los Angeles was once again the destination as the Crimson headed back down to play Fresno State (10-5) at a neutral location.
The Crimson was in the dirt early on. The doubles point went to Fresno State after the Bulldogs swept the doubles matches.
June Lee suffered her third defeat in as many matches losing to Fresno’s Ace Mayar Sherif Ahmed 6-0, 6-4. Kallenberg and Oosterhout chipped in for wins while Xiong and He continued their impressive weekend with wins at the bottom of the ladder to clinch the victory 4-2.
The team came behind not once, but twice this weekend.
“Even when we were down or we lost the doubles point, I think everyone believed that we could win which is what we need when we play higher ranked teams,” Lee said.

The Harvard women’s water polo team didn’t let a 1-2 start to the nine-game California swing bring them down too far.
If anything, it made the team more focused, ready to adjust, and hungry for wins.
Led by the rock-solid goalkeeping of sophomore Cleo Harrington, the No. 19 Crimson (18-4) bounced back in a big way amidst the busiest schedule of the year, sweeping the last six games of its annual California run to post a 7-2 road trip record. Along the way, Harvard defeated three top-25 opponents.
“When we go on this California trip, it’s really an opportunity to play non-conference games against very good teams, to work on situational things for conference play,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “I was really happy with the adjustments we made over our couple days off.”
HARVARD 9, UC SANTA BARBARA 8
With the game against No. 13 UCSB (12-9) knotted at eight with under a minute left in the fourth quarter, Minnis called a timeout to draw up a plan of attack. The Crimson took advantage of a late exclusion penalty, as junior attacker Michelle Martinelli tossed in the winning goal two seconds before the final buzzer sounded to sink the Gauchos, 9-8.
“All that was in her head, was ‘I do not want to play overtime’, and she just whipped it into the cage, and it was amazing,” senior attacker Yoshi Andersen said. “She got the fall-in shot and really just wasn’t going to leave that game without having put that shot away.”
Earlier in the fourth, in the span of 48 seconds, Martinelli struck twice to give Harvard a two-goal lead, but UCSB clawed its way back to tie the game with 32 seconds remaining.
Harrington closed out her solid weekend by adding 15 saves in goal, several of which were key breakaway one-on-one opportunities for UCSB.
HARVARD 7 , SANTA CLARA 5
Harvard built a 5-1 lead ten minutes into the game against the Broncos (6-10) on a pair of goals from Martinelli. Another pair from senior attacker Rachel Lobato helped the Crimson maintain a two-goal cushion throughout the game, as it went on to defeat Santa Clara, 7-5.
“We talk about controlling the clock, and the possessions--making them matter,” Minnis said. “Being focused on the little details was big for us on this trip and in those close games.”
The Broncos struck first on a goal from 2015 GCC Honorable Mention All-Conference senior Elizabeth Anderson, but Harvard responded with five unanswered to take control. The Crimson took advantage of lax Bronco defense on the counterattack to tally four of those scores in the first quarter.
Santa Clara scored with 0:00.4 on the clock to close out the first half, but Harvard still rode its 5-3 halftime lead to victory.
HARVARD 10, AZUSA PACIFIC 8
Two-time 2016 WWPA Div I/II Defensive Player of the Week Harrington posted a career-high 20 saves to power the Crimson to a 10-8 win over the Cougars (7-16) in the backend of the LMU Invitational.
The sophomore standout, who bested her previous mark of 17 stops, received goal support from freshman attacker Kristen Hong, who scored thrice, and proficient scoring strikes from six different Harvard players.
HARVARD 7, LOYOLA MARYMOUNT UNIVERSITY 4
The No. 14 host Lions (8-14) were unable to break through against Harrington and the Crimson defense despite an abundance of man-advantage opportunities, and Harvard pulled the upset, 7-4. Although LMU freshman goalie Sky Flores recorded 11 saves in the Lions loss, the offense was ineffectual, as the Crimson managed to shut out the hosts in the first half.
Junior attacker Melissa Balding matched the entire LMU team with four goals. Martinelli and senior attacker Charlotte Hendrix provided three more goals of offense to help Harvard to its first ever win over the Lions.
HARVARD 18, REDLANDS 3
The Crimson made short work of struggling Redlands (3-15) in the second game of its Northridge doubleheader. Nine different Harvard players scored, and although the Bulldogs netted two first-quarter goals, a 8-2 halftime lead was more than enough for the Crimson to hold on to.
“Just playing with a lot of heart, passion, being selfless in the water, allowed us to [carry over] the consistency from the defensive end to the offensive end,” Andersen said.
Freshman goalie Sam Acker made nine stops in goal, while the offense kept its foot on the gas with six goals in the third quarter.
HARVARD 15, CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY NORTHRIDGE 13
Just four days after playing in the Aztec Invitational to open the team’s annual California trip, Harvard headed north to take on No. 25 CSUN (8-14), where it defeated the host Matadors in a 15-13 shootout.
The Crimson led 11-5 at the half, but Harrington’s 12 saves in goal was instrumental in fending off CSUN’s comeback attempt in the second half. Harvard’s 14-11 lead heading into the final frame held steady as both teams tightened up their defenses, and the Crimson’s effective clock management prevented any realistic comeback attempt.
Hendrix tallied four goals and Andersen scored three more to lead Harvard. The senior duo was backed up by the trio of Balding, Martinelli, and Hong, who chipped in with two goals apiece.

The Harvard track and field team kicked off its outdoor season this past weekend with a bevy of strong individual performances at the TCU Invitational.
Building on a strong indoor season, in which the squad took home first place at the Ivy Championships for the second consecutive year, the women’s team notched strong performances in the 100-meter dash, 400-meter hurdles, and team relays.
Freshman Gabby Thomas nabbed first place in the 100-meter dash with a wind-assisted personal best of 11.39 seconds, ahead of fellow freshman Ngozi Musa, who scored sixth place in the same race with her own personal best of 11.66 seconds. Both come off an indoor season during which Thomas and Musa went back and forth in the 60-meter dash.
Thomas also set a new Harvard record on her way to a sixth-place finish in the 200-meter dash. Her 100-meter time during this weekend’s meet would also have set a new Ivy record.
Harvard also swept the top two spots in the 400-meter hurdles, where senior Autumne Franklin claimed first in 57.79 seconds—less than three-tenths of a second faster than junior Jade Miller, who won the silver medal. Miller’s second-place run was a full 1.26 seconds faster than the third place time.
Elsewhere, Harvard swept both relays by comfortable margins, winning the 4x100-meter relay by five-tenths of a second and the 4x400-meter relay by more than three seconds. The Crimson’s 44.85 second mark in the 4x100 was a new school and Ivy record.
In the throws, junior Nikki Okwelogu—recently named a First-Team All-American for the second consecutive year based off her performance at the NCAA Indoor Championships—claimed first in the discus and second in the shot put. Okwelogu’s throw of 54.06 meters in the former event was good for a new Harvard record.
The men’s side was highlighted by a host of top four finishes, including two second-place finishes from junior Brandon Price in the 1500-meter and from junior Brett Henderson in the javelin throw. Price’s time of 3:50.32 was good for a personal best.
“It was a great first meet for us,” sophomore hurdler Jay Hebert said. “We didn’t have a ton of people there, but the ones who were there did very well, and for a first meet it’s a sign of good things to come.”
Junior Julian Nunally set his own personal best in the outdoor shot put on his way to fourth place, with a mark of 16.92 meters. The Crimson scored two more fourth place finishes from Hebert in the 110 meter hurdles and senior Spencer Lemons in the high jump, and a third place finish from freshman Myles Marshall in the 400-meter dash.
The Crimson squad now has roughly a month and a half before Ivy Championships in May, where the men hope to improve on last year’s sixth-place finish, and the women hope to defend last year’s crown.
“Going into Heps, we always want to do better than we did last year, which means scoring points and getting people to set their personal bests,” Hebert said. “If we take care of things on an individual level first and get everyone on the same page, I think you’ll see the team prosper as a result.”

Harvard softball (9-10) wasn’t able to repeat earlier success in its second Californian tournament over spring break, dropping four out of five games in the San Diego State Classic II. The Crimson pulled out a win in its last game of the tournament against the University of San Diego after a weekend full close losses, two of which went into extra innings.
“Spring break was a long stretch having about 11 games in approximately ten days. It was a good experience, a good building trip,” captain Zoe Galindo said. “I think we had great success our first weekend in LA and then going down to San Diego for the second half of the trip for the last five games I think we really played some opponents that pushed our limits more and made us uncomfortable in certain situations.”
HARVARD 4, SAN DIEGO 1
The Crimson picked up its only win of the weekend  in its final matchup against San Diego. The 4-1 victory over the Toreros Saturday afternoon ended a five game losing streak for Harvard and boosted its overall record in California to 5-6.
The scoreboard remained blank for both teams for the first three innings of the game until senior Haley Davis broke through in the top of the fourth with a home run to put Harvard up 1-0. The Crimson then notched three more runs in the sixth to secure a commanding 4-0 lead.
Senior pitcher Morgan Groom kept USD scoreless for five innings, striking out six on the day.  The Toreros were only able to record one run on a Harvard error after San Diego’s Mary Grabowski tripled. Freshman pitcher Kathleen Duncan came out to close out the game in the seventh, inducing three groundouts to secure the win.
BRIGHAM YOUNG 2, HARVARD 0
Brigham Young shutout the Crimson in its tournament opener on Thursday. Base runners were rare for Harvard, with the Cougars keeping the Crimson to only three hits on the game.
Harvard had an early chance to score in the second with a Haley Davis double and a Savannah Bradley single with only one out, but BYU struck the following two batters out to end the inning.
Duncan was solid in the circle allowing only two runs over eight hits, but a Cougar RBI double in the fourth and solo homer in the fifth was enough to secure a BYU lead and end the contest.
SAN DIEGO STATE 8, HARVARD 7
The Crimson forced eight innings after overcoming an earlier 4-2 deficit with five runs in the sixth inning, but was unable to bring home the win when San Diego State answered with two runs in bottom of the sixth and two runs in the eighth.
Freshman Meagan Lantz led the Harvard comeback with a grand slam, making up four of her five RBIs in the game. The first run was scored before Lantz’s dinger thanks to Junior Jillian Leslie’s RBI when she earned a walk with the bases loaded. Lantz notched her final RBI of the game at the top of the eighth with a single to drive Davis home.
“In the SDSU game and throughout California Meagan Lantz had a really great week. She really proved herself in different situations,” Galindo said. “When she hit a grand slam to get us back in the game it was really huge moment and it really fired everyone up.”
The Aztecs scored in its first three innings up to bat with one in the first, two in the second, and one in the third. Freshman Rhianna Rich started the initial drive to close the gap with a left field single in the third to score Harvard’s first run of the game.
Lantz’s hit in the eighth gave Harvard the 7-6 lead, but the Aztecs answered the call with a two-RBI double to earn them the walk off 8-7 win.
“SDSU is suppose to be a really competitive team and we were able to tie it up and go into extra innings,” Rich said. “It was great to see the team come together at the end of the game and put up a fight.”
COLORADO STATE 6, HARVARD 1
Lantz again stood out in the Harvard offense, driving in the lone run of the game with her first career triple in the sixth inning. Lantz’ contribution, although, was too little, too late to catch up to the 6-0 lead Colorado State had already built up.
Colorado State capitalized on a combination of passed balls and wild pitches to score its first three runs. CSU recorded one run in the first and four in the second to set up an early 5-0 lead. A Rams RBI single in the fifth rounded out Colorado State’s runs and secured them the contest even with Lantz’s RBI in the sixth.
ST. MARY’S 9, HARVARD 8
Harvard forced its second extra innings game of the tournament when Davis hit a homerun in the bottom of the seventh to tie up the score.
The Crimson bounced back from a low scoring offense against Colorado State to take an early 4-0 lead in the first against St. Mary’s. Junior Giana Panariello drove in Harvard’s first run with a double to the left that plated Rich. An infield RBI single by Bradley then brought home another Crimson to make it a 2-0 game. Leslie batted two-RBI single to bring both Panariello and Bradley home to score giving Harvard a promising, early lead.
St. Mary’s scored two runs in the top of the second to cut the deficit in half. The Crimson answered in the third extending their lead by three more runs. The Gaels rallied over the next three innings to score five runs. Harvard added two more to their score to end the seventh tied at 7-7.
St. Mary’s continued their scoring streak, sending two batters home in the top of the eighth. Lantz scored a double to drive home Rich, but the Crimson failed to tally another to match the Gaels.
“Even though the games in San Diego didn’t always fall in our favor, I think that it taught us a lot and gave us some good weapons going forward and where to improve and where to kick off with,” Galindo said.
