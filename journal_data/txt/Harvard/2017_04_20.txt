After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Edie Meidav’s short story anthology “Kingdom of the Young” fails to meet high expectations: Though her previous three novels were universally acclaimed, her first anthology does not live up to the hype. Many times her untraditional writing style feels laborious just for the sake of being difficult and different. There is a reason why novels written in more traditional styles—or even just with proper grammar—are popular and enjoyable. Sometimes different isn’t better. For the most part, Meidav’s writing style is verbose and parenthetical. Her style makes it difficult to distinguish important details, such as setting or characteristics of the narrator. Nevertheless, the writing style in “Kingdom of the Young” sometimes provides the reader with an unsuspected gem.
Choice pieces are written in stream of consciousness in an attempt to highlight what she tries to make an original writing style. The most striking example of this unsuccessful technique is the first, namesake story in this anthology. “Kingdom of the Young” is a short piece about an army of young soldiers judging their leader as he ages into his thirties. In four pages, there is not a single paragraph break. The sentences are long and rambling, and they are only made more incoherent by their incorrect grammar and aimlessness. The second sentence of the story spans 11 lines and speaks on a completely different topic by the end than that first introduced. This opening piece is not only verbose but exhausting to read and feels much longer than four pages. Because this rambling unfortunately takes place many times throughout the book, the stories never really flow.
However, the worst part of this style isn’t the long-winded sentences but the improper grammar, because it both obscures Meidav’s meaning and breaks the flow of her writing. Meidav seems to be fond of omitting words like “the” and “is,” along with pronouns, and she constantly leaves out the subject in her sentences. Though Meidav’s poor grammar is intentional, this writing style actually makes the writing feel so unnatural that it alienates its reader. Sentences such as “The crawl, if barely,” and “No and nugatory, choice clearly Hobson’s,” create ambiguity about the true subject and sound disjointed. The lack of pronouns and subjects not only makes the writing difficult to understand on a sentence-by-sentence basis but also clouds important details such as the age, ethnicity, gender or location of the narrator, which often times denies the reader crucial contextualization needed to fully grasp the point Meidav wishes to make. This lack of proper grammatical structure within the stories in “Kingdom of the Young” makes deciphering Meidav’s meaning a chore, and often not an enjoyable one. By trying to distinguish herself with this particular approach, Meidav obscures the messages of her stories, which are often the one redeeming quality of her pieces.
While the writing structure is irksome at best, Meidav does drop an occasional gem. For example, she describes getting older as getting “stuck inside bigger bodies.” Sometimes she describes mundane phenomena in peculiar ways, that by their very strangeness enhance the image she portrays. Meidav depicts a staring contest between a man and a young boy as the latter “stares back like someone declared us in a contest until his eyelids shut the way an alligator’s do.” At times, she also successfully captures deep meaning in few words: For instance, as a character wonders why he—an immigrant from Cuba—can’t seem to become as rich as the Americans he sees, he decides that “maybe where [he] comes from is what tears open my pockets.” It is small moments like these that make “Kingdom of the Young” more readable.
Although the various subjects Meidav broaches—including tales of dictators in Cuba, quinceañeras, and a woman looking for love in the caves of Granada—are interesting, the rambling manner of Meidav’s sentences make this anthology less enjoyable. The inconsistent grammar makes it difficult for a reader to enjoy and understand the stories. “Kingdom of the Young” has a lot of interesting things to say, but Meidav’s writing style is a wall that too often comes between her meaning and her reader.

Lights up on Washington Heights—and at the Oberon, where Harvard College TEATRO!, a student Latino theater organization, staged a stunning production of “In the Heights,” on April 13 and 14. Lin-Manuel Miranda’s original, Latin-infused musical tells the story of Usnavi de la Vega (Nick Hornedo ’19), the owner of a bodega who sells a winning lottery ticket. Directed by Danny L. Rodriguez ’18, “In the Heights” soared to new levels of theatrical achievement, showcasing student excellence in acting and directing, while also giving voice to the Latino immigrant experience.
Lighting and design set the scene, blurring the lines between stage and audience. In one energetic dance number, actors salsa-danced through the aisles and around tables. Characters looked over the audience from the balcony, but the plot also unfolded conventionally onstage. Creative lighting decisions—intermittent bursts of light aimed at a disco ball to depict fireworks, for instance, as well as the use of cell phone cameras during a fabricated black-out—expanded the space of the Oberon, making a relatively small stage feel like an entire New York neighborhood. Other set decisions, namely the notable appearance of a beautiful mural, designed by Delfina Martinez-Pandiani ’17, also struck a chord.
Donning Usnavi’s signature red flat cap hat and short-sleeved button-down, Hornedo not only emulated Miranda’s iconic fast-talking wit, but breathed a special charm into the role that was uniquely his own. “Lights up on Washington Heights, up at the break of day,” he rapped at the beginning of the show. Hornedo’s Usnavi was mischievous, funny, and headstrong—a compelling leading man.
Just as impactful were Vanessa (Julia I. Biedry ’17) and Nina (Allison Toledo ’19). Both actresses wielded an effortless command over the stage that evoked an impressive theatrical professionalism. Both also demonstrated stunning vocal skills. As Vanessa, Usnavi’s love interest who dreams of escaping the Barrio, Biedry deftly navigated a challenging range of complicated vocal material with finesse, versatility, and emotional resonance. Toledo, playing Nina Rosario, a disillusioned Stanford freshman returning home after losing her scholarship, delivered a gripping performance from “Breathe,” her anxious opening solo, to “Everything I Know,” a poignant tribute to her immigrant matriarch.
Toledo’s Nina displayed an enviable natural chemistry with Benny, played by Max W. Whittington-Cooper ’17, who showed an organic stage charisma and degree of comfort under the spotlight. Whittington-Cooper’s Benny was suave and confident, but could also be serious and romantic. Benny and Nina demonstrated palpable sparks, further fueling the show’s vitality. Amid occasionally somber material, Maria Victoria Paredes ’20 and Brandon Martinez ’20 offered much-appreciated comic relief as Daniela and Sonny, respectively.
Though the show’s material was entertaining and enjoyable, it was also an important story to tell in the context of TEATRO!’s mission: to celebrate a genuine view of the Latino experience. “In the Heights” is the story of a community just before gentrification sweeps through the bodegas, salons, and car rentals, turning them into the foundations for upscale retail stores and designer boutiques.
Most of all, it is the story of a neighborhood and the people who called it their home. “Who’s gonna notice when we’re gone?” Usnavi sings in the show’s finale. For the students behind TEATRO!’s “In the Heights,” it seems like that won’t be much of a problem.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last November, I was checked into a Cambridge ER after a suicide attempt. I sat in a hospital gown in an observation room and considered dreams that might be crushed by this interference with my schoolwork. The midterms I had bombed immediately after a friend’s suicide attempt earlier that term would be nothing compared to the risks of not completing the semester. Fragile though I was, I could not imagine a life without a career in medicine. Before I left the emergency room for an inpatient psychiatric facility, I told the nurses and doctors they had inspired me to continue my studies to become a doctor to help people in situations like mine. Their patience with my hysteria amid countless other even graver cases moved me to tears.
The IV sitting in the crook of my arm was nothing new to me. As a child, I went to the hospital for diseases ranging from pneumonia to anemia to anorexia. Many times, doctors had snapped at me when I couldn’t remember my medical history or when my veins yielded too little blood. These doctors were the ones who made me fear ever returning to the hospital, not because hospital visits indicated once again failing health, but because their dismissiveness made me feel unworthy of the care they would give me.
This phenomenon is not limited to doctors. I see this attitude growing, even encouraged, within much of the pre-med community at Harvard. The ER requires that doctors and nurses work together, yet every semester I see the same pattern: At the beginning of the term, students in large classes like Life Sciences 1a and Chemistry 17 form groups, all intent on helping each other study and check problem sets. But then, after the first exam, when grades are returned, the mutual support dwindles. Students get busier, they work harder, they shut themselves off. Those who excel stop helping those who fall behind. Office hours become packed. Nobody wants to fall victim to the curve, so struggling students fall farther and farther behind.
I watch so many of my friends celebrate birthdays and give gifts to friends, and then ignore those same friends the moment they struggle academically. When friends ask for help in a “weeder” class, they become a mere distraction, a stumbling block to be avoided on the search for a 4.0. The only person to even ask me about my prolonged absence was a peer study leader whose office hours I attended religiously, and whose help and emotional support I am forever grateful for. During my hospitalization, only a handful of friends noticed I was gone. None were pre-meds.
Then another friend of mine was rushed to the emergency room. I had finals coming up and told her that she would have to wait until my exams were over. I told myself something stupid about doing more good down the road as a doctor if I ignored her. Someday, 10 or 15 years in the future, I would stitch up the slashed wrists and give drugs to combat the overdose. Someday I would be able to comfort my friend after she collapsed under the pressure. But if being pre-med taught me anything, it was the limits of compassion. Every spare kindness is a risk, and while studying for Chemistry 17, I left my friend in the hospital alone. This is something I can never forgive myself for.
Harvard pre-med classes don’t pretend to be easy. You’ll skip parties, you’ll tell your friend you can’t catch up with him tonight even though he’s been begging you. They never tell you that you’ll have to ignore your friends as they spiral lower and lower. You have to stop bringing your sick friend the lecture handouts, because if they were taking the course seriously, they’d push themselves to go to class, right? And you’ll tell yourself that this is because you want a career that helps people. There are some who can power through, who will help their friends even when it takes time away from their own studies.
But this does not apply as widely as professors would hope. Much of this problem is worsened by the silence surrounding it. All the stress of making the curve applies to mental health as well as test scores. Nobody wants to admit they failed, and everyone acts exhausted but happy, because if you really cared about getting into med school you wouldn’t have breakdowns, you would have studied better, and if you show any weakness, being pre-med probably isn’t for you. And so I spent two weeks in a psychiatric hospital and told no one.
If you finally break down after trying so hard like I did, it feels like failure. Anything that deviates from the “traditional” pre-med track is a failure. If you take physics through a different university, if you take organic chemistry after graduating, if the pressure of pre-med is too much and you stop that track, or if, God forbid, you leave the STEM field altogether, pre-meds look down on you. I looked down on myself when I realized I might not have the emotional strength to stay on the pre-med track, at least at this university.
So of course I didn’t tell any of my pre-med friends about my suicide attempt. Future doctors don’t do that.

A troubling disparity exists between the wages of coaches of Harvard men’s and women’s sports teams. According to a recent Crimson article, the head coaches of men’s teams make, on average, over 40 percent more than the head coaches of women’s teams. Similarly, the associate coaches of men’s teams make, on average, 33 percent more than their counterparts on women’s teams. This is especially concerning given that the nominal growth of this differential has outpaced inflation since 2011.
As a leader in higher education, Harvard must maintain an enduring commitment to gender equality that manifests itself throughout the University. Paying coaches for women’s athletics less than their counterparts for men’s sports sends the harmful message that women’s sports are inferior to men’s, and thus that female athletes are inferior to male athletes. This implicitly reinforces the sexist stereotype that women are weaker and less physically capable than men. Harvard should take immediate steps to close the wage gap and demonstrate that they value their male and female student athletes equally.
We understand that outside economic forces, such as the competitiveness of wages, can influence how much Harvard pays its coaches. We hope that in response Harvard would allocate additional budgetary resources to help level the disparity. Harvard’s mission is to educate and nurture, a task that must include providing women equal opportunities. Putting gender equality into practice in athletics should come before having the most sought coaches or boosting ticket sales.
Sadly, this wage gap is not the only barrier to gender equality in Harvard athletics: the head coaches for all men’s sports teams are male, while the head coaches for half of all women’s sports teams are also male. We call on the Athletics Department to investigate this lack of gender diversity so that Harvard can work towards more parity while maintaining high quality coaching.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the past, I have criticized some feminists for being too moderate, too conciliatory towards men. I have criticized white feminists like Emma Watson for promoting the idea that gender inequality only exists because women haven’t extended a “formal invitation” to men—and not because men benefit immensely from gender inequality. And I still believe that feminism should, at its core, be a revolutionary, intersectional, and unapologetic movement.
But being a feminist, even a watered-down feminist, comes with repercussions. Even Emma Watson’s conciliatory HeForShe speech, where she spends most of the time talking about all the ways in which men are oppressed, triggered intense backlash. Users on the online message board 4chan threatened to leak Emma Watson’s nude photographs in retaliation for her speech. Even though Emma Watson explicitly said things like “men don’t have the benefits of equality either,” her speech was considered threatening and offensive enough to provoke men to punish her.
Speaking out about gender inequality, even in the most conciliatory and moderate manner, is risky. But even the refusal to speak about sexism is dangerous. Gamer and actor Felicia Day made her first public statement about Gamergate, a group of anonymous people on the Internet, many of whom are presumably men, who have made it their life’s mission to harass women and female gamers online.
In the statement, Felicia Day explicitly says that she does not feel comfortable addressing Gamergate—she does not even retweet articles or tweet back at Gamergate’s victims, out of fear of being doxxed. Her public statement, therefore, does not even address the sexism and misogyny rampant in the Gamergate community—she only discusses how scared they make her feel for her privacy and safety, and how they have intimidated her into silence.
And yet, minutes after she posted her statement, Day’s personal details were posted all over the Internet. Even though she did not write any criticisms of Gamergate and was intentionally staying silent on the matter, she was still punished for daring to speak—about not speaking.
It’s scary to be a feminist, and it’s scary to speak out about gender inequality—but only, apparently, if you’re a woman. Speaking out against sexism does not inherently make you susceptible to having your naked photographs and personal information leaked. For example, former NFL star Chris Kluwe wrote an inflammatory piece against Gamergate, calling them a “blithering collection of wannabe Wikipedia philosophers” and “basement-dwelling, cheetos-huffing, poopsock-sniffing douchepistols.”
But, as he pointed out, none of the members of Gamergate tried to release his private information—even though he was far more critical and ruthless in his statement than Felicia Day was in hers. Gamergate didn’t target all the people who actually criticized and challenged and belittled them. Instead, they went after the women who spoke out against them.
White feminism is a real problem, and watered-down feminism that does not address structural power dynamics and intersectionality fails to have any real revolutionary potential. But sometimes, white feminism is the only form of feminism that is safe to peddle at all. Especially for women in high-profile public positions like Emma Watson, pushing for a more radical version of feminism could end their careers and potentially jeopardize their lives and safety.
To a much lesser degree, I have experienced this myself. When I first started writing this column, I was careful not to step on any toes. I wanted to be moderate and write articles that everyone would agree with. I wrote about slut-shaming, the stigma around periods, and rape culture. I thought that these topics would be relatively uncontroversial: don’t shame women for having sex, don’t make fun of women for menstruating, and don’t rape women.
And yet, I received horrible comments from men all over the Internet. They called me a man-hater, they told me to never reproduce, and they told me that no man would ever want to date a “feminazi” like me. Men from Harvard would sit down and argue with me about my articles, claiming that I was going too far and that “not all men” acted that way. I even heard through the grapevine that an all-male final club blacklisted me for my apparently “controversial” beliefs.
The worst comments I received were actually from my most innocuous article, back when I was fairly conservative and didn’t even really identify as a feminist, much less an intersectional feminist. Simply for writing that feminism means the “freedom to have as many sexual partners as I want without being looked down on,” I had my personal photos scrutinized by strange men online, I was called a slut, and I was accused of having sexually transmitted diseases.
So I can understand why women are scared to call themselves feminists, scared to call men out for their misogyny, scared to be more radical or intersectional or loud in their beliefs. It’s scary to be a feminist.
But, at the end of the day, it’s scary to even exist as a woman in this world. I am already afraid. I already live in fear when it’s late at night and a man is walking behind me closely, or when a car full of men drives by and they jeer at me and follow me down the street. Even when I am silent, I am afraid. Silence will not buy me safety.
I have nothing to lose, and I am not going to silence myself out of fear of harassment or violence. And while I understand the real risk that women take every time they speak out about gender inequality, I hope that it’s a risk that we are all willing to take.

UPDATED: April 20, 2017 at 4:08 p.m.
A National Labor Relations Board official ruled Wednesday that Harvard had “not substantially complied with voter list requirements” in a November student unionization election, recommending that the University conduct another election to determine whether eligible students can form a union.
If a new vote count of the November election—which currently shows more students voting against unionization than for it, but remains too close to call—does not end in favor of Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers, Harvard must hold an additional election.
The NLRB report, issued by the hearing officer in the case, Thomas A. Miller,, is a recommendation. NLRB Regional Director John J. Walsh, Jr. will review Miller’s recommendation and reach a final decision about the election.
Under the NLRB’s rules, Harvard or the union could appeal Miller’s decision to Walsh. In a statement, Director of Employee and Labor Relations Paul R. Curran wrote that the University is reviewing the Hearing Officer’s report “to determine appropriate next steps.”
In an objection document filed with the NLRB in December, union organizers argued that Harvard did not provide complete lists of eligible voters in the election, skewing the results and requiring a re-vote. Miller decided in favor of the union in its decision.
“I find that the Employer has not complied with the voter list requirements,” the NLRB decision reads.
While more tallied ballots oppose unionization than favor it, some contested ballots have not yet been counted, and a re-vote may not be necessary. Of the thousands of votes counted so far, 185 more oppose unionization than support it. The NLRB will count an additional 195 ballots in the coming weeks.
Union organizers said they were excited about the NLRB’s reccomendation.
“We are thrilled that the NLRB recognized what we already knew—that Harvard did not comply with labor law, and that we deserve a new, fair, election,” Andrew B. Donnelly, a union organizer, wrote in a statement.
Harvard, meanwhile, maintained that it had conducted a fair election.
“The University believes strongly that the votes and voices of students should be respected and that the election results should stand,” Curran wrote in a statement. “Ordering a new election ignores the majority of students who voted against unionization and is unwarranted by the facts."
The decision marks the latest chapter in an election process that has lasted months. In November, eligible undergraduate teaching fellows and graduate teaching fellows and research assistants headed to the polls to vote in the historic election. But a December vote count was too close too call; the number of contested ballots was greated than the margin deciding the election.
Days after the vote count—which itself was delayed by almost a full month—both sides filed objections to the election with the NLRB. In its objection, HGSU-UAW argued lists of eligible voters circulated by Harvard were incomplete and made the election unfair.
Finally, in February, the two sides began an eleven-day hearing at the NLRB to discuss both the eligibility of the contested ballots and the merit of the objections to the election.
Some union organizers and graduate students said they were hopeful about winning a new election.
“I was excited that the NLRB agrees with the union that Harvard did not do enough to create a fair list,” Eben Lazarus, a union organizer, said. “I’m optimistic about the process of a revote.”
Some graduate students, though, said the NLRB’s decision was unfair.
Andrea Kriz, a vocal opponent of HGSU-UAW, said the NLRB’s decision was biased in favor of the union.
“I don't think it's reasonable that the election only be upheld if the union wins,” she wrote in an email. “If the election is invalid, why should the result matter at all? “
Jae Hyeon Lee, another vocal opponent of unionization, shared Kriz’s criticism of the NLRB’s decision.
“I hope the University appeals,” he wrote in an email.
Lee also said anti-union students would organize to persuade voters to oppose unionization if Harvard held a re-vote.
“At the moment, there isn't a concrete plan for another anti-union campaign if there is a re-vote,” he said. “But I am sure there will be one.”
Harvard is one of a small number of private universities with an active unionization effort. Graduate students at both Columbia and Yale have both made efforts to form a union.

Unlike in previous years, all admitted students of the Class of 2021, including those who have to arrive early to Visitas, will be denied entry to Yardfest this year.
The College's Admissions Office previously allowed admitted students to attend Yardfest if pre-approved to attend Visitas—the College's visiting weekend for admitted students—for financial, religious, or medical reasons. Pre-approved students were allowed to pick up their temporary student ID cards early as well, which they could use to enter Yardfest.
This year, however, even students arriving early for approved reasons will not be permitted inside Tercentenary Theater for Yardfest, the College's annual outdoor concert. 
Yardfest will be held this Friday and headlined by electronic dance music DJ and producer Tiësto. Visitas, meanwhile, will officially start Saturday and run through Monday, April 24. Out of the 2,056 students accepted to Harvard this admissions cycle, more than 1,300 are expected to attend Visitas this weekend.
Caleb Spiegel Ostrom ’18, co-chair of the College Events Board, which organizes Yardfest, confirmed that no admitted students will be allowed at this year’s concert. Current College students are allowed to purchase tickets for guests over the age of 18 with a valid government-issued ID, but according to the CEB's website, “prefrosh are not allowed to attend Yardfest” even with a guest ticket.
Senior Admissions Officer, Director of Visitas, and former Crimson editor Timothy J. Smith ’08 said his office “works with admitted students who have extenuating circumstances which might require other accommodations,” but that “Yardfest is not part of the Visitas programming” and stressed that very few admitted students arrive before the official start date.

UPDATED: April 21, 2017 at 1:59 a.m.
University President Drew G. Faust took a trip to Los Angeles, Calif. this week “to catch up with alumni and donors on the West Coast,” according to University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson.
It is not unusual for Faust to take trips to visit alumni or donors, especially as Harvard nears the final stretch of its record-breaking five-year capital campaign, which is scheduled to end in 2018. Though the University blew past its $6.5 billion goal last year, there are still individual buckets of need that have not yet been filled, including undergraduate House Renewal and the construction of a new engineering campus in Allston.
Faust also visited California in 2014—albeit with more fanfare—when she spoke at “Harvard in Los Angeles,” an alumni networking event promoting the University’s capital campaign. According to a Harvard Gazette article at the time, around a third of Harvard West Coast alumni reside in Los Angeles.
Last month, Faust traveled to Asia to speak at an event in Singapore, which over 400 University alumni attended. Faust also met with National University of Singapore President Tan Chorh Chuan and other academic leaders before traveling to Vietnam on that trip to pay homage to those who died in the Vietnam War.

After some graduate students criticized a change in their summer stipend distribution, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences will allow students to receive their stipend in one lump sum on June 1, as it has in past years.
On April 13, 825 students received an email from the GSAS Financial Aid Office informing them that they would receive summer funding payments in two installments, one on July 1 and August 1.
Soon after sending out this email, though, the GSAS Financial Aid Office provided an alternative to its proposed payment plan. In an email sent on April 18, GSAS Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid Mohan Boodram said students who requested a lump sum payment on June 1 would receive it.
Students said they were concerned about this initial change to their stipend payments. “I was somewhat upset and even distraught at the time when I realized what had been done to the payment schedule,” said Eben Lazarus, a graduate student who has advocated for Harvard students to form a union.
He also criticized GSAS for this choice, asserting the school did not ask for student feedback before changing summer stipend payments.
“It felt completely arbitrary and against my interests,” he said. “It made my life more difficult and stressful.”
In an email, GSAS spokesperson Ann Hall wrote the school changed the payment schedule because of student feedback.
“GSAS heard from students in a number of ways,” she wrote. “The staff of the Office of Financial Aid meet regularly and privately with students regarding confidential matters related to their financial aid.”
Gabriel Tourek, a graduate student and union organizer, criticized GSAS for announcing this change weeks before the beginning of summer.
“I find it very strange and worrisome financially,” he said.
In an emailed statement, Hall wrote GSAS made the change after realizing from student feedback that “students would prefer to count on a regular monthly disbursement rather than a lump sum payment at the beginning of the summer.”
Students praised GSAS for deciding they could request to be paid in June.
“I’m happy that they responded to the many students who called and emailed them to address the changes to policy,” Lazarus said. “I think it’s a good change that they are now willing to grant individuals in need of cash in June.”
Hall said that GSAS has not decided whether the new payment schedule will become standard practice.
“Our policies are reviewed regularly, and decisions are guided by what is best for students as they communicate their concerns to us,” she wrote.
Union organizers argued Harvard’s decision to change payment schedules demonstrated the need for a student union.
The debate over summer stipend payments comes just as a National Labor Relations Board official recommended that Harvard hold a new student unionization election if uncounted votes from the first election do not yield a union victory.

UPDATED: April 20, 2017 at 1:19 a.m.
While some undergraduates said they were excited to learn that Dutch dance DJ Tiësto would headline Friday’s Yardfest, for others, the announcement only prompted the question: Tiësto who?
A Grammy-winning artist and producer known for his remixes of tracks including John Legend’s “All Of Me,” Tiësto has published five studio albums and headlined last year’s Ultra Music Festival in Miami.
Still, some Harvard students said that until Tuesday night, they did not know who Tiësto was. According to Google Trends, searches for “Tiësto” spiked in the Boston area around at 7 p.m. Tuesday night, around the time of the CEB’s announcement.
“My initial reaction was ‘who is this guy?’ I had never heard of him,” Chandler A. Brown ’19 said. “Then I looked him up, and I don’t know, I guess he seemed okay.”
Some objected to the choice of another electronic dance artist: DJ Steve Aoki headlined last year’s Yardfest, the College's annual outdoor concert, in Tercentenary Theatre.
“Unfortunately, I simply do not like house or EDM,” said Lorena Lyon ’18, who said she had never heard of Tiësto. “I guess I was disappointed that they chose another EDM artist two years in a row.”
Jenna M. Gray ’19, a Crimson magazine editor, also said she was “disappointed” by the chosen genre, given rumors that Chance the Rapper or another hip-hop artist would headline the event.
“Last year when I went, it was basically just a bunch of tall men jumping around against people, which is not my definition of fun,” she said, adding that she did not know who Tiësto was before the announcement, but the artist’s name reminded her of the word “Tostitos.”
Other students were more enthusiastic about Tiësto’s upcoming performance. Steffan B. Paul ’19, for one, said he “freaked out” when he heard rumors that Tiësto might be the Yardfest artist.
“When I heard that he was confirmed, I freaked out again,” Paul said. “I was definitely very excited, but one thing that annoys me is that people don’t understand how big of a deal he is.”
Paul also said it was “shortsighted” for students to be annoyed about having another EDM artist headline the concert.
“Out of all the EDM artists, he would have been the one that I preferred,” Paul said.
“Tiësto is so big that I didn’t think Harvard was going to be able to afford him.”
Manav J. Khandelwal ’19, who has seen Tiësto live, said that while not every student will like the artist, Tiësto will provide a “fun” and “high-energy” environment for the crowd.
“I think the purpose of the Yardfest committee is to get someone who can make as much of the student body happy as possible. While not everyone likes EDM, there is not one genre that more than half of the college student body will like,” he said. “I think the Yardfest committee did a good job of taking those things into account.”
Sienna R. Nielson ’19, a member of the student-run medical service CrimsonEMS, said that no matter the artist, she hoped others would enjoy the event responsibly.
“I hope that everyone is safe and that the other members of CrimsonEMS won’t have to do much that night,” said Nielsen.

To ease the stress of impending final papers and exams, Harvard College freshmen can now enjoy a petting zoo, massages, and free yoga classes as part of the Undergraduate Council’s “We Care Week” for the Class of 2020.
We Care Week, hosted by the Council’s Freshman Class Committee, includes four days of programming from April 17 to April 20 around Harvard Yard.
According to Elm Yard representative Grace S. Pan ’20, the week is meant to provide freshmen the opportunity to reflect on their first year at the College.
“We want to give the freshmen class an opportunity to take a breather, take a step back and just kind of engage in some self-reflection,” she said.
For Elm Yard representative Salma Abdelrahman ’20, the week’s events bring a welcome respite from a busy schedule. She said she hopes We Care Week gives others the time “to take care of ourselves, take care of people that we don’t necessarily think about too often.”
This year marks the fourth installment of the Freshman Class Committee’s weeklong initiative. But this year, the week was given a new name, shifting from previous “Freshman Health Weeks.” Freshman Class Committee chair Catherine L. Zhang ’19 said the committee decided to continue the tradition due to its large budget.
“We decided that that is something we wanted to do this year, since we still have a lot of our remaining budget left,” Zhang said.
This year’s We Care Week looks to educate first-year students on issues like mental and physical health, as well as to foster class-wide camaraderie. In addition to the yoga, massages, and petting zoo, the UC will also hold a film screening to raise awareness about suicide prevention.
Abdelrahman said she found the theme fitting, adding that the end of the semester is typically a difficult period for students.
“We’re really bringing awareness to issues that affect students on this campus and really destigmatizing a conversation about mental health, because it is something that is important again considering how stressful this period is for a lot of people,” she said.
Pan said she will judge the success of We Care Week by the number of students  who feel as though they can “get something from these events.”
“I think we measure success just by the way we see the reactions of our freshmen class to these events,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds flocked into First Parish Church of Cambridge Wednesday afternoon to attend a talk by Naomi Klein, where the environmental activist and author criticized the Donald Trump administration’s ties to the fossil fuel industry.
Klein, a member of the board of directors for environmental activism group 350.org, opened her talk by recalling her experience visiting the sites of coral bleaching in Australia and what these signs of environmental degradation may imply for future generations. The event was sponsored by Harvard's Weatherhead Center for International Affairs.
“Climate change is an issue of intergenerational justice. Our collective failure to respond to this crisis means that my son’s generation and the young people in this room, generations yet to come are being wronged of so much of the beauty and wonder that this world has to offer,” Klein said.
Klein specifically criticized the Trump administration’s environmental policies and what she refers to as a recent “regulatory assault” on agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
“We see this merger, between the oil and gas industry and the Trump White House. I think it is fair to say that the US government is now wholly owned subsidiary of ExxonMobil and the Trump Organization of course,” she said.
Klein also criticized petroleum companies, whom she argued are largely culpable for anthropogenic climate change.
"It is not just that Exxon ignored [climate change], ignored its scientists, ignored its own peer-reviewed and published research, it lavished somewhere around $30 million that we know of on think tanks that systemically spread doubt and misinformation about the reality of climate science.”
Klein, who was born and raised in Canada, also spoke at length about Canadian politics, arguing that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is not a proponent of the climate movement.
“He has also approved two major new tar sand projects, he’s been working on pipeline extension, he cheered when Trump was going to approve the Keystone XL pipeline,” Klein said. “It also violated UN declaration of rights of the indigenous people because every single one of these projects was forcibly imposed on the indigenous people.”
The talk was briefly interrupted when members of the audience applauded Klein’s rebuke of Harvard’s investments in the fossil fuel industry. For Harvard affiliates, the University's ties to fossil fuels are troubling—last month, student activist group Divest Harvard blockaded entrances to University Hall, calling for a “moratorium” on the University’s investments in the coal industry.
“[Trudeau’s administration] is very like Harvard. They say all the right things, really good at diagnosing the problem, but when it comes to putting their money where their mouth is and divesting from fossil fuels, not so much.”
Emphasizing the need for change, Klein called on individuals to  mobilize in support of environmental protections.
“Trump controls one very powerful part of this country but not all of it. He does not control what cities do, he does not control what states do. He doesn’t control what schools do and he doesn’t control what universities do.” Klein said. “And he doesn’t control what we do as individuals.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students flocked to Science Center Hall B Wednesday for this year’s Veritas Forum, a discussion on the compatibility of modern scientific knowledge and religious faith.
Biology professor Robert A. Lue, and MIT professor and nuclear scientist Ian Hutchinson, led the discussion, which focused on whether scientists can believe in miracles and a higher power.
Several campus groups, including Harvard College Faith and Action, the Premedical Society, and the Catholic Student Association sponsored the event, which was moderated by History of Science professor Anne Harrington.
Hutchinson, who is a Christian, kicked off the panel with a straightforward, though joking, answer to the event’s central question.
“Can scientists believe in miracles? We can answer that question pretty easily—I’m a scientist, and I believe in miracles. So the answer is yes,” Hutchinson said, drawing laughter from the crowd.
He went on to talk about the questions humans have always faced despite scientific progress.
“There are fundamental aspects of the universe that deterministic laws do not, and as far as we know, cannot accurately describe,” Hutchinson said. “Science has labored mightily for centuries to understand the world in a deterministic way, only to find that the universe resists complete description.”
He added: “Yes, we know more today than people did long ago, but what we know today makes the universe seem, if anything, even more open."
Lue, a self-described agnostic, spoke about his experience volunteering with a Jesuit group in Jamaica as instrumental in the formation of his spiritual philosophy.
“Arguably, I saw humanity, perhaps at its low point,” Lue said. “Repeatedly, I would come across individuals who nevertheless went beyond themselves for others.”
“I feel that the miracles I saw [in Jamaica] don’t require a God,” he added.
Hutchinson described the decision not to believe in miracles a kind of faith in itself.
“If you adopt the firm opinion that miracles just don’t happen, then you’re doing so not as a matter of science, but as a matter of faith,” he said.
Although the forum billed the event as as a discussion between two speakers with divergent beliefs, Lue and Hutchinson found that they shared significant common ground.
“No, science is not the only path to knowledge. Now, here’s the alarming thing—that Ian and I might actually end up agreeing. I mean, you guys came here for a cage fight, right?” Lue said to laughter. “No, I don’t think there is a Great Wall of Science.”
Harrington also pointed out the apparent agreement between the two professors.
“One of the things I’ve been struck by in your comments is the degree to which both of you take a certain kind of modesty in the way you approach the question,” Harrington said. “It isn’t the kind of hegemonic one side over the over. You carry your scientific identity alongside your religious identity.”
“I don’t see a conflict between science and religion,” Lue said at the end of the conversation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Nadya Okamoto ’20 begins her unconventional bid for a spot on Cambridge’s City Council, she has had some early success.
A 19-year-old Harvard freshman who has already gained national media attention for her nonprofit work, Okamoto has had no trouble garnering media attention: The Huffington Post, The Boston Globe, and US News and World Report have all covered her precocious campaign.
But as someone who has never run for elected office nor lived in Cambridge for more than several months, Okamoto and her staff lack typical political experience as they head into a crowded City Council race, a point some Cantabrigians have been quick to point out.
More than 25 people, including eight incumbent City Councillors, are competing for the nine open seats on the City Council. Okamoto is facing broad competition from politicians with years of experience and residency in Cambridge.
Robert Winters, editor of the Cambridge Civic Journal and local political pundit, said that Okamoto’s campaign may be more than a long-shot. “I have to admit to being just a bit wary when someone who is brand new to the city —and who likely knows next to nothing about the city, its neighborhoods, or its history—launches into a self-promotional tour before actually getting to know more than a handful of people who actually live here,” Winters wrote in an email.
For her young campaign—every single member of Okamoto’s seven-person campaign staff is an undergraduate—the challenge will be to successfully translate national buzz into local votes and dispel the notion that Okamoto won’t have the time or knowhow to serve on the council.
Okamoto said she is up to the challenge. “I want to do what I can where I can. And where I am is here,” she said. “If we show that we can do a good job at a young age, I think we can show other young people that they can do this as well.”
Already drawing from her previous experience founding and running a national nonprofit, PERIOD, which distributes feminine hygiene products to low-income women, Okamoto and her staff have started fundraising and formulating policy proposals. She said she’s been in contact with current City Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen during the young campaign.
As of Monday, Okamoto has raised more than $1,200, and her staff is set to live together in Cambridge this summer to work full-time on the race, although Okamoto will occasionally travel back to Portland to keep tabs on her nonprofit work.
While she has not yet released an official platform, which she said will be out soon, Okamoto said she plans increasing funding for pre-kindergarten programs, developing affordable housing, and raising the minimum wage.
“There’s so much we can be doing” she said. “Whether that be pre-K programs or school funding or organizing.”
Okamoto also said she hopes to pressure universities in Cambridge to contribute more to the City in hopes that it can help solve some of the most pressing issues facing the city. Harvard pays millions to Cambridge every year in lieu of property taxes.
“The universities do not do enough to help with community development and even local economic development” she said. “They aren’t doing all they could be to support the living of the students.”
If elected, Okamoto said that although she would like to continue with school, she would take time off if the two conflicted. She says that she would make around $80,000 a year for her time and that residents deserve effort.
When asked if they would be compensated for their work, all of Okamoto’s campaign staffers declined to comment.
Okamoto isn’t the only Harvard undergraduate running for a city position though—William H. MacArthur ’20, a Cambridge native, is looking to secure a spot on the city’s School Committee, which oversees the operation of the local school districts.
The Cambridge general election will be held Tuesday, November 7.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Some softball games can be characterized as pitchers’ duels, where neither offense can make anything happen against dominant performances in the circle. Others are slugfests, where neither side can seem to stop scoring runs. Still others fall in the middle, average games that are not very remarkable.
This midweek matchup between Harvard (15-16, 6-6 Ivy) and Providence (13-22, 3-9 Big East) was a bit of everything. Though the contest began as a classic pitchers’ duel, the floodgates eventually broke open in the fifth inning. When dust settled, the Friars had dispatched of the Crimson, 8-3.
“Even though the score didn’t end up in our favor, I think we learned a lot of things today,” said co-captain and second baseman Giana Panariello. “We worked hard, got to swing our bats a little bit, made some adjustments at the plate, and really learned what it was like to stick to the process.”
Before the fifth inning, this contest was a battle between Crimson freshman righthander Olivia Giaquinto and Providence junior hurler Christina Ramirez. Through two full innings, Giaquinto had racked up four strikeouts and had only allowed two bloop singles into right field. Ramirez matched Giaquinto’s strong start, walking one and striking out two.
“We had a lot of hard-hit ground balls right to people, and then we started to get behind the ball a little more and put some runs on the board,” head coach Jenny Allard said. “We just needed to do that earlier.”
When the fourth inning ended however, a switch flipped for both offenses, but more so for the Friars.
Giaquinto’s control faltered slightly in the top of the fifth, as she walked the leadoff batter and put another on via free pass two batters later. She recovered and struck out sophomore third baseman Vanessa Portillo for the second out of the inning.
However, a wild pitch to the following batter meant that once again Giaquinto faced a high-pressure situation with runners on second and third, two outs, and a 3-2 count.
This time the freshman was unable to escape unscathed. Junior shortstop Paige Mulry poked a single over the head of second baseman Melissa Lacro to plate two. Providence continued to pile on the runs in the top of the fifth, as a single and a double into left field scored two more.
“[Giaquinto] had her curve working well,” Allard said. “Her rise ball was jumping, and she had that changeup. And then she started just to lose some pitches. She walked a couple of batters, hung a few pitches, they got some key hits, and that was it.”
Harvard’s offense figured out Ramirez as soon as the Friars figured out Giaquinto. In the home half of the fifth, singles by Lacro and pinch hitter Jillian Leslie and a subsequent sacrifice bunt put runners on second and third for sophomore shortstop Rhianna Rich. Rich delivered by lacing an opposite-field double to plate two, and she later scored on an error by Mulry to cut Providence’s lead to 4-3.
“For us, I saw the kids that came up in the fifth inning really swinging harder through the ball,” Allard said. “Before we were getting to the ball, and we weren’t getting through the ball hard enough.”
Responding immediately to the Crimson’s sudden offensive outburst, the Friars matched their four-run output from the previous inning. Senior catcher Nicole Lundstrom launched a towering two-run home run that clanged off the scoreboard to widen Providence’s lead to 6-3. Two straight singles into left field and a Portillo triple into the right-center gap chased around two more.
Harvard made a comeback bid in the bottom of the seventh, but it was unable to mount enough momentum to put runs on the board. Leading off the inning, pinch hitter Isabelle Haugh was hit by the first pitch she saw. Two singles from Rich and third baseman Erin Lockhart loaded the bases, but a fielder’s choice and a double play quickly curtailed the Crimson’s comeback effort.
Ramirez recorded a complete game win after escaping the seventh untouched. The Providence junior allowed two earned runs and struck out five.
Early on in the game, Giaquinto showed composure in the circle to work out of a difficult jam. After a walk put runners on every base, the freshman righthander battled against Portillo in a long at bat. The Providence third baseman popped a ball up just past first base, and it looked as though it would fall in to allow the Friars to break the early stalemate. Though junior right fielder Maddy Kaplan’s diving bid came up just short, the ball was ruled foul, and Giaquinto eventually ended the threat with a swinging strikeout on a slow changeup.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

BOSTON—Unlike their helmet-wearing or sneaker-sporting peers, members of the Harvard baseball team do not typically have a halftime intermission to break up the action of their contests. However, such was the case on Wednesday afternoon when Mother Nature put a temporary halt to the Crimson’s Beanpot championship matchup with Boston College at Fenway Park after four and a half innings. The Eagles will be leading 3-2 in the bottom of the fifth inning when play resumes at a date to be determined.
Both teams entered Wednesday’s contest with severely depleted pitching staffs. The Crimson (13-19, 2-10 Ivy League) was coming off a weekend in which all ten pitchers on its staff were used and the group was tagged for 45 runs over four games. BC (12-22, 3-15 Atlantic Coast Conference) made the trek across Beacon Street following a trip to Dartmouth on Tuesday afternoon during which it used five arms. Harvard coach Bill Decker sent out right-handed reliever Garrett Rupp to start Wednesday’s contest while Mike Gambino countered with sophomore lefty Dan Metzdorf. Within the first few minutes of the game, it was evident that both pitching staffs had eaten their fair shares of innings of late.
Harvard freshman second baseman Quinn Hoffman jumped on the first pitch he saw from Metzdorf, launching the offering over the famous Green Monster in left field. It was the first collegiate home run for Hoffman and one that he will not soon forget. The freshman’s father, Trevor, played at America’s Most Beloved Ballpark over his 18-year MLB career while his uncle, Glenn Hoffman, manned the shortstop spot for the Red Sox from 1980-1987.
“I saw a good pitch to hit, it was low in the zone, and put a good bat on it,” Hoffman said. “I didn’t think it was going to go anywhere. It’s just a surreal moment and an amazing opportunity to get to play at Fenway. To be in the same infield as [my uncle], where he played is pretty special.”
Hoffman’s start to Wednesday’s game strongly resembled the Crimson’s last contest at Fenway Park. Captain Jake McGuiggan ’14-’15, who battled injuries throughout his senior season but made a point to return in time for Fenway, went deep in the first inning of Harvard’s Beanpot consolation game against Northeastern in 2015.
McGuiggan’s long ball two years ago took on special meaning for the Hingham, Mass., product and lifelong Red Sox fan, who went yard on the same day as teammate and fellow Massachusetts native Conor Quinn. Playing at the MLB’s oldest stadium and one that the Harvard baseball team helped christen in 1912 took on special meaning for captain Josh Ellis, the club’s only Bay State resident to appear in the game.
“It’s definitely a dream come true,” captain Josh Ellis said. “I got to play a few innings last time, but it was nothing like being behind the plate where Jason Varitek was; he’s one of my longtime heroes. It’s pretty cool to see the backdrop and see the Monster and get to play with some of my closest friends.”
After the first inning ended without another peep out of the Crimson offense, the Eagles went to work on Rupp. Junior outfielder Donovan Casey beat out an infield single to break up the Harvard junior’s no-hit bid before it began. After Casey advanced to second on a fielder’s choice, he was driven in on a gap-finding double from senior centerfielder Michael Strem.
Despite the major league grounds crew tasked with manicuring it, third base lived up to its hot corner nickname on Wednesday afternoon. A Gian Martellini bullet ate up Harvard third baseman John Fallon and extended the inning. A double from junior first baseman Mitch Bigras plated Strem and gave the Eagles a 2-1 advantage.

Despite the rocky starts by both starting pitchers, the offenses were held scoreless up until the bottom of the fourth inning. Rupp went two frames for the Crimson before being replaced by freshman left-hander JT Bernard. The first-year ran into trouble after walking BC left fielder Jake Alu to kick off the fourth. On three consecutive pitches, the sophomore managed to steal second, third, and cross home on a wild pitch.
“I love when guys run on me,” Ellis said. “It was tough, a couple great jumps. I can see that from my vantage point so it’s a little frustrating when it takes a while for a pitch to get there but I just gotta do what I gotta do, get a good throw on it. Having Q in the middle, put a couple tags down, makes it easier.”
Harvard got the run back its next time up as sophomore first baseman Patrick McColl doubled and was driven in by classmate John MacLean. The run appeared to put the Crimson within striking distance for the game’s final four and a half innings but instead ended up being the capstone to the first half of a game that will take a week or more to be completed.
The inclement weather was not a surprise to the two teams or the umpires. The Beanpot’s consolation game between Northeastern and UMass was condensed to seven innings and the break between the two games was trimmed from 45 minutes to 20 in an attempt to give Harvard and BC more time to beat the rain. But it was not to be.
“When you’re playing in a venue like this, they need to do what they need to do,” Decker said. “I think we started our conversations around 3:00 during the first game. It’s a treat for the kids, for Josh from Milton, and for Quinn. We’ll find a way to finish it, unfortunately it’ll be somewhere else.”

Finally, finally, the CEB has decided to let us know that Tiësto will be performing at this year’s Yardfest. It appears the non-disclosure agreement actually worked this year. For now, though, Flyby wants to think of what could have been. There have been some truly wild rumors about which musician will grace the Yard, and everybody loves a little drama. Join us in revisiting all the whispered names and the memorable Facebook fights with this playlist of Yardfest rejects. Or, more likely, artists who rejected Yardfest. Listen on Flyby’s new Spotify for these artists and more!
Martin Garrix
CEB seemed more than happy to let this rumor flourish, and it was pretty believable. After all, we’ve had Steve Aoki; Garrix would be a continuation of the EDM trend. But there’s only so many times you can get turnt to ‘Animals.’
The Chainsmokers
Speaking of things there’s only so many times you can get turnt to. The Chainsmokers are probably too expensive, too bro-y, and too we-just-won-a-Grammy for Harvard, but enthusiasts still #believe.
Carly Rae Jepsen
No matter how plausible this theory was, those in the CRJ camp were very passionate. Remember when they fought with the group that wanted The Chainsmokers in a Facebook group? Good times.
Snoop Dogg
How this was a believable possibility, we’ll never know. As if Harvard could ever get the D-O-double G. Although, come to think of it, Yardfest is scheduled for the day after 4/20, so you never know…
Take a moment, everyone.

Hey, man. Not to be blunt, but you should probably know by now that Massachusetts decided to puff, puff, pass the legislation that makes recreational marijuana legal for the 21+ crowd. Let’s be honest, we all knew California was going to legalize that green goodness, but Massachusetts? Pretty sure not too many people had high hopes. However, our trusty ol’ Commonwealth decided to light one up for all the cannabis crusaders and approve this dope law. In honor of the first 4/20 in post-legalization Massachusetts, we’ve grinded out the details of what would be the dankest spots to hit up today if we lived in a world where Harvard—and the federal government—let smoking on campus fly.
The River - A favorite of campus potheads, the river provides the ideal outdoor vibes for all your smoking needs. Not recommended January through March, when gloves and a pre-rolled joint are necessary, but ideal for late April.
Cabot Rooftop - For all you quadlings who are partial to chronic, Cabot rooftop gives you both privacy and a sick view. Day or night, this high-up spot is a great place to get high. Other roofs for reefin’ include the Carpenter Center and the Science Center.
Fogg Museum Steps - It’s literally called the Fogg, guys. This spot is a favorite of the seasoned smoker, and definitely a good one for a chillier night. Head down the staircase that leads to the basement of the museum and light up under the shelter provided by questionably clean concrete walls. Flashlight optional.
Cambridge Commons - Meeting up with a smoke squad of both quadlings and river homies? This spot is the perfect compromise. For the spookier crowd, there’s always the cemetery across the way. Just make sure you don’t confuse smoke clouds for ghosts.
Lowell Community Garden - Grass belongs in a garden, so what better place to light up than our very own community garden? For all the blazers who frequent the esteemed establishments of Mt. Auburn Street on the weekends, take a break from dancing on tabletops to consume some grade-A kush.
Your Room - For the lazy blazers. But hey, those fire escapes are pretty rad.
We’re definitely not saying you should make a trip to these locations today. That would be wrong. But maybe these spots will convince Snoop to play at Yardfest next time around.
Editor’s Note: Smoking in public spaces is still illegal under Massachusetts legislation. Read more about the nuances of Massachusetts’s marijuana laws here, and about Harvard’s drug and alcohol policies here, which prohibit smoking on campus.
