After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yale University’s Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and more than 80 of its former members have settled lawsuits with victims of a collision at the 2011 Harvard-Yale football Game, which left one woman dead and two others injured.
Though the exact terms of the settlements—which were resolved outside the court— were confidential, none of the defendants admitted any liability, according to Ralph F. Sbrogna, an attorney for the family of victim Nancy Barry. 
At the November 2011 tailgate in New Haven, Brendan Ross, then-Yale junior and member of Yale’s Sigma Phi Epsilon chapter, lost control of a U-Haul truck while transporting alcohol to the fraternity’s tailgating area, accelerating into a crowd of people.
The collision killed Barry, a 30-year-old resident of Salem, Mass., and injured two others—Harvard employee Elizabeth Dernbach and Yale School of Management student Sarah Short.
In 2012, Short’s estate filed a lawsuit against Ross and the fraternity; the national organization sought to distance itself from the accident. The complaint also listed U-Haul and Yale as defendants, but the claims were later withdrawn.
In late 2013, Short’s and Barry’s estates filed separate lawsuits against people who were members of Yale’s fraternity at the time of the incident.
The final defendants of the lawsuits were the national chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon, the local Yale chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon, and the 80 to 85 individual fraternity members of the local chapter who were listed as individual defendants, according to Sbrogna.
The fraternity and its members  originally were scheduled to go to court in Waterbury, Conn. this week, but instead it was resolved outside of the court.
Sbrogna said that after four years, the victims’ families were glad to gain some closure on the case.
“They did gain closure as a result of the settlements,” Sbrogna said. “They lost a very vibrant, remarkable young woman, and whatever they’re going to gain from this settlement is not going to help bring her back.”
The local and national chapters of Sigma Phi Epsilon did not respond to request for comment.
Following the incident, Yale administrators revised tailgating guidelines, prohibiting oversized vehicles in the student section of the tailgate, banning kegs, and ending tailgates at kick-off. The 2016 Game will be played at Harvard, which has won the past nine matches.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Another day, another top three opponent humbled. Just 24 hours after defeating No. 2 Penn, the No. 1 Harvard women’s squash team (4-0, 3-0 Ivy) cruised past No. 3 Princeton, 9-0, at the Murr Center Squash Courts on Sunday.
Led by freshmen Sabrina Sobhy and Kayley Leonard, No. 1 and No. 2 in the lineup respectively, the Crimson dropped just three sets total on the night against the Tigers (4-1, 0-1 Ivy). Princeton came into the match having yet to drop a game, sweeping its previous four matches, 9-0.
Sobhy, whose sister Amanda ’15 was last year’s individual national champion for Harvard, started proceedings by sweeping sophomore Olivia Fiechter. After missing the first two matches, Sobhy has already emerged as one of the team’s heavy hitters.
Leonard, who deputised in the No. 1 spot briefly to start the season, then dispatched her old Greenwich Academy teammate, junior Maria Elena Ubina, to improve to 4-0 on the season. Greenwich is well-represented on both rosters, with the Tigers featuring four alumni and the Crimson two.
Harvard has been dominant to start the season, dropping just three games out of 36 in four matches. Last year’s national champions look dangerous once again, having defeated both of their closest competitors already this season.
Sophomore Alyssa Mehta and her freshman sister, Sophie, Toronto natives, won in the third and eighth spots, respectively. Alyssa defeated senior Rachel Leizman to reach 3-1 on the year while Sophie swept freshman Isabel Hirshberg to stay undefeated.
The Mehtas’ high school teammate, fellow Branksome Hall alumna Michelle Gemmell, defeated sophomore Kira Keating in the fifth spot. Another Toronto native, junior Dileas McGowan, defeated junior Gabriella Garr at No. 7. McGowan lost the first game of her Crimson career against Penn, but rebounded against Princeton to end the weekend with a 30-1 collegiate record.
Junior Katherine Tutrone swept fellow junior Alexandra Toth to climb above .500 on the year. Sue Ann Yong won in the No. 6 spot, winning all three sets against freshman Samantha Chai.
In her last career regular season match against the Tigers, captain Saumya Karki defeated senior Isabella Bersani, 3-0, to improve to 37-5 for Harvard all-time.

Behind 18 points from junior guard Corbin Miller, the Harvard men’s basketball team took down Ryerson (4-2), 73-57, to close out a five-game homestand.
However, despite the double-digit victory and the Crimson (8-8, 1-0 Ivy) reaching .500 for the first time since the opening weekend, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker was not content.
The key to the game was Harvard’s power in the paint, as the Crimson outrebounded the Rams 58-32. But, as Amaker said afterward, this statistic shouldn’t stand out because of Harvard’s size advantage and the scenarios in which the rebounds were coming. With every positive statistic, Amaker held back from praise because of the room for improvement he saw in his team as it nears the end of nonconference play.
“We chased [rebounds] down which was awesome,” Amaker said. “I thought that as impressive as the 58 total was getting the 23 offensive rebounds, guys going to the glass, [but] another factor with that is that we didn’t shoot as well.”
Ryerson typically relies on throwing up threes at a high rate, and the Rams continued that style of play with little success against the Crimson. Ryerson attempted 37 threes, three more than the team’s average of 34 attempts per game, but only converted nine of its attempts.
Meanwhile for Harvard, it was success behind the arc that created the initial separation. With the Crimson up just one with 12:41 to go in the first half, Miller stood at the top of the arc looking for a pass. Junior forward Zena Edosomwan came forward and set a pick for Miller, who stepped left a drilled an open three to widen the lead to four.
“The big wasn’t hedging on that ball screen,” Miller said. “He’s down below giving me space to shoot, so I figured I had to take it.”
Just over four minutes later, after Ryerson pulled back within three on a dunk by Jean-Victor Mukama, Lavietes Pavilion experienced deja vu as Miller and Edosomwan executed an identical play to stretch the lead to six. Though the lead would drop back down to three after a trey from Roshane Roberts, Miller’s hot hand gave the Crimson a jolt that allowed his team to create separation with the Rams.
While the scoring became more balanced as the game went on, with Edosomwan scoring 10 of his 11 points in the second half, it was Miller once again who gave Harvard its biggest lead of the game when he hit his sixth three-pointer of the night, stretching the advantage to 20. The shot notched Miller’s name in the record books, leaving him ninth in program history with 128 made three-pointers.
Miller’s six threes came on a night when the rest of the team struggled to convert from behind the arc, as the team went 7-for-22 overall from deep. The most notable struggles came from freshman guard Corey Johnson, who failed to hit a three for the first time in his rookie campaign. This was the first time all season that Miller was the sole-leader in scoring. Overall, Harvard has had seven different players lead the team in scoring, which the team sees as a strength going into Ivy play.
“It definitely helps us, it’s nice to know that we have guys that can score, that can pick us up, not that we’re depending on one guy,” Miller said. “It makes us dangerous ...Having guys that can step up and make shots, it gives all of us confidence knowing that if one guy is off other guys can step up and are ready to play.”
With the game all but over, Amaker went to the bench in the waning minutes of the contest, with every healthy player seeing game action. While the bench contributed 40 of Harvard’s 73 points, perhaps none garnered a louder reaction from the bench than the last basket for the Crimson–a nothing-but-net three from freshman forward Balsa Dragovic.
At 6’10’’, many of the fans had a look of surprise when the big man hit one from behind the arc, but that wasn’t the case for Harvard. While the bench went crazy, the team knew that Dragovic had that weapon in his pocket.
“One of his weapons is to be a guy with size who can step away and make a shot and i was really pleased and happy for him,” Amaker said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After four unsuccessful attempts, the Harvard men’s basketball team (8-8, 1-0 Ivy) finally made its way to .500 for the first time since Nov. 14, dispatching the visiting Ryerson Rams (4-2), 73-57. Despite an uneven first 10 minutes, Harvard went on a 21-6 run midway through the first half to take a 17-point lead and never looked back, holding a double-digit lead for the final 23 minutes of play.
LIVE BY THE THREE, DIE BY THE THREE
Harvard and Ryerson came into the game stylistic opposites on the offensive end. While Crimson coach Tommy Amaker preaches an “inside out”, pass-heavy offensive philosophy that grinds down shot clocks and relies on superior post play, Ryerson generates spacing using the three-point shot. The Rams came into the game shooting 34 treys a contest, making 12.
The unorthodox style confused Harvard early, as Ryerson took a 6-5 lead in three and a half minutes on a pair of triples. It wasn’t until the 10:42 mark that the Rams made a shot in the paint, while Harvard went nearly nine minutes before hitting its first three.
The single triple proved telling, however, as it jump-started a career night for junior Corbin Miller. The Utah native, who finished with a season-high 18, hit his first trey in rhythm, curling off a screen and letting it fly without hesitation. After two Harvard turnovers, the Crimson ran the same play. Ryerson again played under the screen and got the same result: another Miller trey.
Two minutes later, when Ryerson cut Harvard’s lead to three, Miller came right back. Moving to the wing, he nailed another triple to jumpstart a 12-3 run that pushed the lead to 29-17.
“I think offensively we’ve found that we have guys that can step in and score,” Miller said. “We’ve talked about, small little habits, little things that we need to hone in on, so that’s our focus at this point.”
On the game, the backup point guard had a career-high six treys, nearly matching Ryerson’s game-long output (nine triples) on 24 fewer attempts. His 12 three-point attempts were a career high, giving life to a cold-shooting unit. Harvard’s starting freshman backcourt of Tommy McCarthy and Corey Johnson missed all six three-point attempts and it wasn’t until little-used freshman forward Balsa Dragovic drained a triple with 41 seconds remaining that another Crimson player nailed a three.
Afterwards, Amaker singled out the efforts of Dragovic, who had five points and three rebounds in six minutes—more than doubling his season totals in both categories.
“He stepped out and faced up with confidence and that’s certainly how he’s played in practice,” Amaker said. “I made mention of him in our postgame comments to our team and I thought he did a very, very nice job.”
CRASHING THE BOARDS
Inside the three-point arc, Harvard was equally successful. The Crimson overpowered its opponent inside, outrebounding Ryerson 58 to 32 overall and 23 to six on the offensive end. The Crimson nearly outrebounded its opponent under their basket, grabbing 23 offensive rebounds to Ryerson’s 26 defensive boards.
“We have a saying ‘the more you go after, the more you get’ and they went after them,” Amaker said.
One of the Crimson’s leaders on the offensive glass was freshman Weisner Perez. Seeing his first real minutes in a month with sophomore Chris Egi sitting, Perez had nine points and 13 rebounds in 18 minutes. The rookie shot poorly from the field, making just four of 11 attempts, but rebounded two of his own misses on the way to seven total offensive rebounds.
On one telling possession, Perez and senior Agunwa Okolie combined to garner three straight offensive rebounds. Normally excellent finishers around the basket, the forwards outhustled Ryerson defenders to each ball but could not sink their first three layups. When Perez got fouled on the fourth shot attempt, the bench was up and cheering.
“I think they were a smaller team and guys were just being aggressive on the glass,” said junior forward Zena Edosomwan, who finished with 11 points and 10 rebounds. “There were definitely some height mismatches [and] I think guys saw the opportunity to crash the glass.”
