After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Joshua G. McIntosh, the associate dean who had been picked to temporarily lead the Office of Student Life after Dean Suzy M. Nelson’s departure in June for a position at Colgate College, will leave Harvard himself in August to become Dean of Academic Services at Johns Hopkins University.
During his six and a half years at Harvard, McIntosh had a hand in developing the College’s gender-neutral housing policy, improving House grilles and other campus social spaces, opening the new Office of BGLTQ Student Life, and coordinating swing space housing for the Quincy House residents who will be displaced by the renovation of Old Quincy in the upcoming school year.
Calling McIntosh’s departure “a huge loss for the College,” Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds announced McIntosh’s new appointment in an email to College staff.
“Josh has been an outstanding leader in Harvard College, and numerous students have benefited from his tireless efforts,” Hammonds wrote.
McIntosh, who recently completed his Ph.D. in higher education administration from Syracuse University, wrote in an email to The Crimson that the job offer from Johns Hopkins represented an opportunity to grow professionally.
“While the decision to leave Harvard was not an easy one, it is the right time to begin a new professional journey,” McIntosh wrote.
The announcement of McIntosh’s departure comes two and a half months after Nelson announced that she would be leaving the College at the end of June.
Nelson’s and McIntosh’s departures leave a void at the helm of the Office of Student Life, where only two of the top four deans will be returning to the College in the fall.
In March, McIntosh was tapped to fill Nelson’s place as interim dean of student life. When McIntosh leaves in August, Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich will take over the interim dean position until a permanent replacement is named, Hammonds wrote in her email.
Over the past year, Hammonds has seen the departure of two more top administrators, her senior adviser Paul J. McLoughlin and Assistant Dean of Student Life Susan B. Marine.
McIntosh, formerly an administrator at Syracuse, came to Harvard in 2006 as an assistant dean. In 2009, when the Office of Student Life was created as part of the reorganization of the College administrative structure, McIntosh was promoted to associate dean.
McIntosh wrote that during his time at Harvard, he has particularly enjoyed working on initiatives that advance inclusion at the College. When he leaves Harvard, McIntosh wrote, he will miss most “the extraordinary students and the wonderful colleagues who have also become close friends over the years.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After finishing its season this past weekend with an eighth-place finish in the Sperry Top-Sider/Intercollegiate Sailing Association Women's National Championships, it is finally summer for the Harvard women’s sailing team.
The team had to travel far from familiar Northeastern waters for the national regatta, as this year’s championships were held on Lake Travis in Austin, Texas. The Crimson qualified for the 18-team national regatta with its seventh-place finish in the Women’s New England Championships on Apr. 21-22.
Harvard came in looking for its sixth national championship—and its first since 2005—but finished in eighth, one spot lower than its seventh-place overall finish last season.
Racing began on May 30 with steady winds that reached 12 knots. To advance to the final round of competition, the Crimson had to finish in the top nine during the first day and a half of competition in the semifinal round.
At the end of the first day, Harvard stood in fourth place. And although the team fell two spots in the second day of competition, its sixth-place showing was good enough to advance to the finals.
Senior skipper Emily Lambert paired up with sophomore crew Isabel Ruane, representing the Crimson in the A division, and the tandem scored a total of 60 points in the semifinal rounds. Racing in the B division, sophomore skipper Morgan Russom and senior crew Alexandra Jumper nearly matched their teammates, notching 61 points, to bring the team’s total to 121.
The finals began on May 31 and lasted until June 2. Although the sailors enjoyed favorable weather on the first two days of competition, little breeze on the third day limited the competitors to a couple of races.
But the suboptimal weather did not get the best of Ruane and her teammates.
“We basically took it one race at a time and had to continue to do what we did well and improve on what we didn’t do as well,” Ruane said. “It’s a regatta just like all of the other ones we’ve had this year, so we [tried to treat it that way]. There were different conditions all weekends that required some adapting, so we had to remain consistent despite those conditions.”
Ruane and Lambert continued to compete in the A division. The racing partners finished with 105 total points. Russom and Jumper tallied 113 points in the B division.
The combined score of 218 put the Crimson in eighth place. Boston College won the national regatta with 142 points, just four better than Yale, the runner-up.
Despite finishing near the bottom of the pool of competition in the finals, Ruane said that the team was happy with its performance.
“We trained really hard and expected to have tough competition and hopefully make it through semifinals to the final round and to do our best there,” Ruane said. “We just wanted to see what we could do against the toughest competition we had seen all year.”
Russom agreed but added that the end of the season brings bittersweet tidings.
“We had a lot of good training going into nationals,” Russom said. “We performed really well, and we are happy with our results, but we’re sad that we are going to lose all of our seniors. They really helped to push our team.”
Looking beyond the coming summer, the team has tempered optimistm about its future.
“We are feeling good about our season,” Ruane said. “We are losing two members of the team, so that will be tough next year.  But everyone coming up the ranks did well in this regatta, so that bodes well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If the University of Washington has ever been an underdog, it was this year.
After  losing to the Harvard heavyweight crew at the Head of the  Charles, the Huskies entered the 2012 season with a rare No. 2 ranking,  a spot behind the Crimson.
But at this year’s IRA National Championship, Washington was as dominant as ever, sweeping all five races.
The Crimson finished fourth, falling to the Huskies, Brown, and California.
“Washington had a really exceptional regatta,” said captain-elect and varsity bowman James O’Connor.
While  Harvard failed to take the national title, the Crimson still managed  bronze medals in both the varsity eight and second varsity eight.
“It’s hard to be disappointed, but it wasn’t the result we wanted,” O’Connor said. “We got beaten by some really good crews.” 
While  the 1V and 2V were the only boats to medal, the open four and freshman  eight both made the grand finals, placing fourth and fifth,  respectively, while the varsity four took eighth with a second-place  finish in the petite final.
“I was proud of the team as a whole,” said senior and 2V five-seat Nick Jordan. “It was a good showing.”
A stiff tailwind for all crews meant no time to wait for a move—and a limited chance to think.
“It was go-go-go the whole way,” O’Connor said.
In  the varsity eight race, Harvard appeared to have opened strongly. But  with a restart in the grand final, it didn’t count, and its second start  was not quite as fast.
In the second go, the Crimson still managed to stay competitive with Washington through the first 1,000 meters.
At that point, Harvard started to fall behind.
“In the third quarter, Washington put more pressure on,” O’Connor said.
Brown was able to catch Harvard in that same 500.
Both  the Huskies and Brown were able to respond to the Crimson’s sprint, and  Harvard finished around three seconds off Washington’s course-record  pace of 5:21.482 and a little more than second behind Brown.
“It was such a great race,” O’Connor said.
Washington and Brown were also the Crimson’s foils in the second varsity eight race.
“We were going into it...knowing that Washington would be pretty hard to catch,” Jordan said.
Off the line, though, the Huskies weren’t the only crew to spike the rating.
“Brown and Washington jacked it off the start,” Jordan said. “We focused on rowing our race.”
And  while it wasn’t enough to catch the Bears or the Huskies, the Harvard  2V managed to edge out California and Wisconsin for the final spot on  the medals dock, beating to crews to whom Harvard lost at the San Diego  Crew Classic and Eastern Sprints, respectively, earlier in the year.
While Washington and Brown were the main opponents of the 1V and 2V, a gaggle hurt the chances of the freshman eight. 
A  pack of geese interfered with the first-year crew, and its fifth-place  finish is its first and only loss of the season. After hitting geese 500  meters into the race and in the race’s final stretch, Harvard's attempted protest of the race was unsuccessful.
The  Crimson finished less than three seconds behind bronze medalist  Northeastern and less than a second off fourth-place Cornell.
The  varsity four, which raced in the petite final, placed second in its  race for an eighth-place finish overall. Harvard finished a  second-and-a-half off Holy Cross and over a second ahead of the Badgers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For  two straight years, the Harvard lightweight varsity eight flirted with  perfection only to be defeated on the biggest stages. First there was  the 2010 crew, which finished the dual season unbeaten only to take  silver at EARC Sprints and  bronze at the IRA National Championships. Next there was the 2011 boat, which matched its 2010  counterparts in the dual season and got the job done at Sprints but  finished a mere .02 seconds shy of a national title.
But  this year’s 2012 crew was just too fast. And for the first time since  2003, the Crimson rowers got to stand on the medal dock as national champions after a victory at this past weekend's IRAs on the Cooper River in Camden, N.J. 
“I’m  so happy we were able to get it done the way we did,” senior coxswain  Angela Chang said. “Having that loss [last year] motivated us to have a  really hard training season. It really paid off.... It feels great to  see everyone’s best and find our top speed and come out on top.”
It  was a season Harvard dominated from start to finish, with fall  victories over its collegiate counterparts at the Head of the Charles and the Princeton Chase to set the  tone early. It also found the right lineup early, with the IRA boating  identical to the lineup that raced the Charles.
“I  think from the beginning, there were obviously high expectations,”  Chang said. “We found speed and rhythm from the beginning, from the  fall. We were able to continue improving throughout the season. There  was never any hint of complacency. People just wanted more and more.”
Each  year, it was a different school that played the role of the  heartbreaker. In 2010, it was Princeton who took Sprints and IRAs, with  Navy taking silver at IRAs. Last year, Yale edged out the Crimson for  the national title.
This  year, it was Dartmouth who stood the best chance. The Big Green took  silver at Sprints, finishing two seconds off Harvard, and were only .1  seconds behind the Crimson in the morning’s race for lanes.
But in the grand final, Harvard made its move in the second 500 and never looked back.
“We  definitely wanted to attack that [500],” said senior six seat Tim  Moore. “Such a strong tailwind makes a really short race. You don’t want  to wait around for everything.”
That 500 gave the Crimson a lead of around five seats at the 1000-meter mark.
“That’s when I knew we had to hold on to it but knew that they’d be moving in the last 500,” Chang said.
The  Big Green did indeed move, but Harvard held on for a win of almost a  second and a new lightweight course record with a time of 5:33.059.
“I think in the last 500, they were definitely taking a few seats, [but] we kept to our time and held them off,” Moore said.
“We were in control the entire race,” Chang added.
It was a perfect ending for Moore, the only athlete to have raced in the 1V all three years.
“To  take a win, since that has been elusive, is definitely a good feeling,”  Moore said. “I have my cap off to the rest of my boatmates.”
Moore was joined in the 2011 season by Chang and co-captains-elect Matt O’Leary and Erich Schultze, both rising seniors.
This  year, the boat welcomed four junior rowers from the 2011 2V who capped  off their undefeated seasons with IRA gold in the lightweight four:  stroke Florian Mayr, seven seat Alex Newell, five seat Nick Gates, and  four seat Stu Taylor.
“They brought that winning spirit,” Moore said.
It  has been a particularly good year for the Newell family, as Alex’s  older brother Will ’11 qualified to race in the London Olympics in the  lightweight straight four, while mother Nelia ’79 was a member of the  coaching staff for the Radcliffe lightweight team that earned an IRA  medal in the 1V race for the first time since 2006.
Rounding  out the boat was bowman Michael Wales, the crew’s lone sophomore. Wales  stroked the 2011 freshman eight and rowed for the US U23 quad with  O’Leary, Newell, and Schultze.
“The  group of guys is pretty remarkable,” Moore said. “We all work hard,  we’re all committed to pushing ourselves individually. We are a lot of  fun, there are a lot of characters in the boat.... I think it’s pretty key  to...not take yourselves too seriously.... I think this boat has embraced that  balance.”
The  Crimson’s other boat, the lightweight four, which was composed of  rowers from this year’s freshman eight, was unable to replicate its 2011  success. Harvard finished fifth overall after taking second in the  heat.
