After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Think Harvard students can't get down?
Think again.
A driven group of the class of 2016 brought swag to campus when they started the Harvard College Rap Collective, which was officially approved by the OSL on April 1, according to the group's Facebook page.
The group was started by Martin C. Carlino '16, who also serves as its current president. Since its formation, the Collective has dropped one single called "Party on Mass Ave." The single currently has over 600 views on YouTube and has gotten positive feedback from students on Facebook. The catchy beat (originally from Mac Miller's "Party on 5th Ave") features Rashad Hossain '16 and Will N. Corbett '16, who spit rhymes about the square and Harvard life: "Meet me at the Owl we got coats to lose / get that DAPA grant spend it on booze."
The group has been in the works since near the beginning of the academic year. The Collective's founding members said they shared a desire to share their love for rap with their peers.
"We needed to make it happen," said Rashad Hossain '16. "It's our hobby and it's very important to us. We're just a bunch of kids who love to spit rhymes, and it's a shame that Harvard didn't already have an official rap group. Just like singers and their a cappella groups, we're rappers in a hip hop collective."
Stay tuned for more to come from the Harvard College Rap Collective—they plan on launching a full EP in the near future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This column explores Harvard student life and its implications. Throughout the semester I have tried to address some of the important or pressing issues that exist on campus for students. However, in light of the last couple of weeks, the issues Harvard faces seem cursory in comparison to how fortunate we are as a whole. With this in mind, I decided to address several much more lighthearted topics. I spent the week asking my classmates, friends, and random people in the dining hall for input. I’ve compiled some of their ideas into the following list of “Things We Just Can’t Understand About Harvard.”
1. When is the grass cut?
Have you ever seen or heard a lawn mower at Harvard? Ever? My window looks out on Mather courtyard, and though I have seen and heard our stellar maintenance staff doing everything from shoveling snow to raking leaves to reseeding grass (all of which seems to take place at 6 AM) I have never caught sight of a lawn mower. The Yard, the Quad, the Tercentenary Theatre and the courtyards of Harvard always look pristine, but I have never seen someone trimming grass, which leads me to one of three conclusions: One—Harvard grass is lab-generated and genetically mutated to stay short forever (like the huskies that are always puppy-sized). Two—like Harvard students, Harvard grass is perfectionist and strongly believes that growth is a “mind over matter” thing. As long as he (or she?) thinks hard enough about it, he will stay A+ length. Three—House elves cut the grass every night. Frankly, the last seems most plausible.
2.Why is Dunster not on Dunster Street, and so many more?
Kirkland is on Dunster Street, while Kirkland Street and Quincy Street intersect behind Annenberg, which is nowhere near Quincy or Kirkland (or Dunster for that matter). Harvard Street merges into Mass Ave before it gets to Harvard. On that note, Yenching Auditorium isn’t in the Harvard-Yenching Institute, and Mather Hall is not in Mather House, but is actually in Old Quincy. It’s no wonder that Harvard operates on Harvard time, because clearly seven minutes (or more) is used to figure out the lay of the land. While those poor students are wandering through Lowell, and possibly the Owl, in search of their UHS appointment, maybe they’ll run into thousands of tourists who have been lurking on Harvard St. for some years now, insisting that Harvard must be around here someplace. (Note that this contingent is mostly men, because their female relatives asked for directions about three years ago and have since taken approximately 1763 selfies with the John Harvard Statue.) When you think about it, Dewolfe is the only building actually on its respective street—and who wants to be there on time anyway?
3. What is with acronyms and all the funny words?
“I was a bit confused about blocking, but I didn’t know where the APO was, so I asked my PAF, who referred me to my proctor. She looked at the OSL website and told me I should actually go to drop-in office hours at the FDO. I missed office hours though, because my linkmate was trying to find out about summer study abroad and went to the OIE, but actually needed to go to the OCS, and then got hit by bus while crossing the street between them, and had to go to UHS. My friends got mad at me for missing office hours and kicked me out of our blocking group, but—even worse—I missed a meeting with my TF, so I still don’t know the difference between OEB, HEB, and MCB, and probably will have to become a VES concentrator instead.”
Say what? I know Harvard is “innovative,” but was a whole new language necessary? Wouldn’t my Harvard degree still be legitimate if a TA ran my sections and I majored in engineering? Maybe that’s just me. On a side note, what is the difference between OEB, HEB, and MCB? That’s something about Harvard I’ll definitely never understand.
4. How do the freshman football players know to sit at the front table of Annenberg?
Throughout my two years here I’ve heard various explanations for how the football players know to occupy the front tables at Annenberg, but none convince me. Yes, the football team reaches campus early, but until freshman move-in the team eats in Dunster. Then, until upperclassman move-in, the older football players still eat in Dunster, while the frosh players start to sit at the front tables of Annenberg.  How do they know? Is it in their letter of intent? “You will not do drugs. You will graduate from high school. You will sit at the front table.” Or maybe they find out the first day of practice. “Welcome to the team. Here are your pads. Here is your locker. Here is where you sit in Annenberg.”
Maybe “not understanding” is a dominant characteristic of Harvard. From Annenberg tables to my classes, there is plenty that I don’t understand. Maybe it’s all part of the experience. Whatever the reason, if anyone finds a house elf mowing the lawn let me know. The tourists on Harvard St. send their love.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Agrícola Brinzal is a Chilean logging company currently facing lawsuits for felling 189 acres of native forest and then reforesting with foreign tree species. The corporation’s practices, which include growing water-intensive eucalyptus trees, have been accused of harming both the environment and nearby communities. According to a recent university tax filing from 2011, Harvard owns 99.99 percent of Agrícola Brinzal, which generated more than half a million dollars in income for our endowment. As students who benefit from the profits of this company’s business model, we are disturbed that Harvard has stood by as Agrícola Brinzal has been accused of degrading the environment and neglecting local laws.
Like many universities, Harvard funds much of its staff and faculty salaries, student financial aid, operating costs, and research budget with its endowment earnings. Unlike many universities, however, Harvard’s endowment directly owns more than 100 companies, many of them natural resource and timber companies in the developing world. And unlike most universities, Harvard directly owns at least one company that has been implicated in illegal land exploitation practices.
Last month, two investigative reporters in Chile released a report detailing the exploitative logging practices of Chilean companies owned by Harvard. The report, published by the Center of Investigative Journalism of Chile (and later translated into English), quotes a government official explaining that the scale of Agrícola Brinzal’s logging is unprecedented on the island of Chiloé. Harvard’s company has either bought up recently clear-cut land or engaged in the felling of native trees itself, and reforested that land with eucalyptus trees. Recognizing the destructive environmental effects of this deforestation, CONAF, the Ministry of Agriculture’s National Forestry Corporation, has brought multiple lawsuits against Agrícola Brinzal. The lawsuits allege that the company’s logging practices are both illegal and environmentally devastating, wreaking irreversible havoc on Chile’s prized natural forests.
Furthermore, locals have maintained that the company’s actions have been detrimental to local communities. Carlos Muñoz Grandón, president of an organization of residents living near land owned by Agrícola Brinzal, was quoted in the report stating that the company’s reforestation negatively affects local farmers: “It’s a great impact—it’s a huge one—from the fumigations to the growth of eucalyptus, because we will have huge problems with water distribution...That’s going to affect animal and milk production, which is the economic source for people here.”
In recent years, Harvard Management Company has invested heavily in the timber asset class. The University first entered the sector in 1997 based on a suggestion by Jane Mendillo, now President and CEO of HMC, and began investing in Chile in 2004. According to Harvard’s 2011 tax filing, Harvard now owns at least 11 companies in Chile. Harvard holds these companies through subsidiaries—for example, Agrícola Brinzal is owned by Phemus Corporation, one of HMC’s wholly owned investment companies that enjoys non-profit tax status.
Despite the fact that Agrícola Brinzal is 5,000 miles away from our Cambridge campus, Harvard is responsible for its practices and the practices of all its companies. Harvard often brags about the Harvard Forest, the site of the Harvard Forest Program on Conservation Innovation, where experts investigate the destructive effects that habitat degradation and development can have on the environment and local communities. Why should a company owned by Harvard allegedly neglect the environmental regulations and practices that our University’s own researchers deem so important?
Harvard’s aggressive approaches to timber and agribusiness in Latin America are unique among universities. A recent report identified only one university endowment with direct holdings in forestry and agriculture investments in Latin America: Harvard. Our peer institutions have so far entered the markets through indirect ownership schemes and externally managed funds. We are concerned that Harvard’s problematic practices may set new standards for endowment investing.
Jane Mendillo wrote in a September 2012 message that HMC employees “fully vet potential investments and investment partners for long-term viability” and perform “legal and operational due diligence” for every investment decision. Harvard’s ownership of Agrícola Brinzal casts serious doubts on the wisdom of HMC’s current policies. HMC ought to review, revise, and publish its due diligence policies and processes before the end of the semester so we can be sure such abuses will not happen again.
As a nonprofit education and research institution, Harvard University has the responsibility to ensure that it does not negatively impact the world. If Harvard is committed to funding research, student life, and financial aid from the profits of natural resource companies, it should, at the very least, ensure that its approach to natural resource investment does not actively violate the law as Agrícola Brinzal allegedly has.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Think back to November 6, 2012. Harvard's campus was full of energy. We marched and carried signs and wore stickers, and we voted: An overwhelming number of students registered in Massachusetts went to the polls on Election Day. We held our breath with the entire nation as Massachusetts played host to one of the most anticipated elections in recent memory with Elizabeth Warren challenging Scott Brown for his Senate seat. The truck-driving Brown, victor of the special election to replace the late Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56 had improbably won the seat after positioning himself as a moderate and a populist. Though he kept good to his word on some issues in the Senate, Brown came up woefully short on issues as important as equal pay and access to contraception.
In the face of an excited and mobilized electorate, Brown could only watch as the voters of the Commonwealth, including a record number of students, swept Warren into office, choosing a progressive voice to advocate for their interests in the Senate. Next week, Massachusetts voters face a similar decision, and the stakes are just as high as before.
With the confirmation of John F. Kerry as America’s new Secretary of State, Massachusetts once again faces a special election. Though the general election is still two months out, the primary election to determine each party’s nominee is this Tuesday, and the choice on the Democratic side could not be clearer.
The Harvard College Democrats broke from historical precedent this February and issued an endorsement in the primary race. We overwhelmingly endorsed Congressman Ed Markey for the nomination because, unlike his opponent, Markey is a reliable champion of the progressive cause and will vote in the Senate with the best interests of students in mind.
Challenging Markey in the election is Stephen Lynch who, despite being a registered Democrat, may be more conservative than Scott Brown. Lynch voted against the President’s healthcare reform that allowed young adults to stay on their family insurance plans until age 26. Though he quickly updated his stances to twenty-first century standards upon entering the race, Lynch has constantly been on the wrong side of social issues ranging from a woman’s right to choose to the ability of a person to marry whomever she loves. Lynch failed to sign an amicus curiae brief that urged the Supreme Court to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act as unconstitutional (though he has since blamed this on an email glitch).
Fortunately, Lynch is not the only choice for voters. Through more than four decades of public service, Ed Markey has proven himself as a skilled negotiator and an effective voice for Massachusetts in Congress. Perhaps Markey’s most impressive achievement is authoring the only bill aiming to counteract the dangers of climate change that either chamber of Congress has ever passed. In addition to leading the charge on energy and environmental issues, Markey voted for the President’s health care reform and is an ardent supporter of the medical research and healthcare technologies that are central to the economy of our Commonwealth.
Congressman Markey’s progressive credentials run deep. He supports common sense gun safety reforms such as closing the gun show loophole, universal background checks of gun purchasers, and restricting the sale of high-capacity ammunition clips. He is a proponent of a balanced and responsible approach to foreign policy, one that doesn’t needlessly put the lives of American servicemen at risk. Decades ago, he became one of the first prominent supporters of marriage equality and has not wavered in his support, even when it has cost him political points.
Brown won in 2010 not just because he was able to cast himself as a centrist, but also because Democrats in Massachusetts decided to sit back in that special election. The idea of Brown winning seemed so unlikely and remote that many Democrats considered his defeat a forgone conclusion. This mentality inspired a low voter turnout that proved crucial in giving Brown the electoral edge.
Voter turnout is similarly the greatest uncertainty facing Ed Markey in his campaign for Senate. If you believe—as John Kerry, Vicki Kennedy, the Boston Globe, and countless other Massachusetts leaders do--that this state needs a Senator who will support the work of the President and Senator Warren, a Senator who will work on making real progress for Massachusetts and the nation, then make sure your voice is heard in next week’s primary.
You made a difference on November 6, 2012. On April 30, 2013, you can make another important decision for the nation's future. After your morning classes, hop over to your polling place. Remember Ed Markey when you cast your ballot on Tuesday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every resident in greater Boston was caught up in the panic that descended upon our city after the tragic shooting of an MIT police officer on Thursday night. The people of Watertown and students at Harvard University and MIT spent Thursday night through Friday afternoon holed up in their rooms in fear, eyes glued to smartphones and computer screens, relaying any and all updates and rumors to friends while listening for remote police sirens. But much of the information being propagated by the media was inaccurate, and Harvard’s administration should have done more to make sure that reliable information was available to students. In a situation where many equate information with safety, official channels must be as fast as responsibly possible in keeping people abreast of ongoing events. Otherwise, misinformation will almost certainly pervade.
From the bombings to the search for suspects and from the manhunt to the investigation into the motives of the Tsarnaev brothers, it is obvious news sites, social media, and texting dominated the dissemination of information throughout the week. In this maelstrom of information, the media was occasionally guilty of presenting unconfirmed falsehoods as truths. The New York Post was quick to point the finger at a Saudi national in relation to the bombings, bringing unwanted attention to an innocent college student. CNN was criticized for embracing sensationalism over reality and often sacrificed the truth in order to publish flashy updates on the crisis, with John King incorrectly reporting that an arrest had been made on Wednesday, April 17, two days before the suspects were actually apprehended. Meanwhile, the general manager of Reddit was forced to apologize after a destructive digital witch-hunt for the bombers undertaken by many of his users falsely named various innocents as suspects.
The combination of being bombarded with false information along with our generation’s dependence on social media for information made it particularly difficult for Harvard students to discern false news from the truth, especially given the situation’s emotional intensity. To further complicate matters, the Harvard administration failed to provide reliable, official information throughout the week to the detriment of our confused, scared student body. The administration was particularly silent during the bombings, when students relied largely on Google’s “Find a Person” application and on The Crimson’s website to keep track of their friends and family. The administration’s silence while some students heard incorrect information about potential explosions on Brattle Street, Massachusetts Avenue, and Copley Square only exacerbated on campus. Although there were improvements during the manhunt, we need consistency from the administration in times of crisis.
However, Harvard’s official communication can only do so much to dispel misinformation from other quarters. Without second question, some media outlets immediately highlighted the Tsarnaevs’ Chechen ethnicity and linked the Boston bombings to the Islamist movements in the unstable North Caucuses region of Russia. These faulty assumptions are a symptom of the media’s impulse to carve out narratives before a storyline is clear, and it is up to us to wait for reliable news before we form our opinions.

Three panelists described current medical research and long-term goals to reform care and policy on athletic head trauma and concussions during a biannual symposium of the Harvard Society for Mind, Brain, and Behavior in Science Center C on Friday afternoon.
Presenting a photo of the brain of a 50-year-old diminished to the size of an infant brain, Boston University professor of neurology and pathology Ann McKee noted that early results from research into chronic traumatic encephalopathy—a neurodegenerative disease often caused by repeated hits to the head—have been alarming.
McKee directs BU’s Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy with Chris J. Nowinski ’00, a former All-Ivy linebacker and WWE wrestler. Repeated blows to the head from years of competitive sport have caused significant brain damage in more than 90 of the 150 brains they have in their database.
Following the discussion on research, Stephanie Morain, a graduate student in health policy at the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, highlighted the difficulties of implementing concussion policies on local levels.
Right-to-play laws that would limit tackle football in certain age groups, Morain said, are not uniform across states and some areas are more resistant than others to reform.
During the question-and-answer session, Nowinski, who suffered multiple concussions in his career, added that coaches and doctors have perverse incentives not to diagnose their players with concussions.
“There are all sorts of incentive problems with medical care at the highest level,” Nowinski said. “You don’t get that job if you are a player advocate.”
Another problem, according to Nowinski, is players condoning and speaking publicly about intentionally failing baseline concussion tests.
“[Cheating the test] to me is not an ethical tragedy because these are adults signing up for a dangerous job,” Nowinski said. “They better not be trying to make it cool like Peyton Manning, when he is telling the press he cheats on his baseline test so kids do it [too].”
Community Events Co-Chair for HSMBB Daniel Z. Wilson ’14 said the topic’s recent popularity nationwide and on campus made it accessible to a wider audience.
“This seemed like the topic which was not too contained just in the world of neuroscience,” Wilson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With signs that read “Nosotros Somos Iguales” and “Keep Families Together” as a backdrop, students gathered on the steps of Memorial Church Saturday evening to speak out about comprehensive immigration reform.
Entitled “Out of the Shadows,” the speak-out was organized by the student advocacy group Harvard College Act on a Dream. According to the group, there are roughly 40 undocumented students at the College, with nine potential incoming freshmen who are also undocumented.
At the event, students shared their personal stories to paint a clearer picture of what undocumented citizens look like and describe the many fears that accompany undocumented status.
“Even though I went to a really good university, I still won’t have a job after I graduate,” said Francisco D. Hernandez '13, a psychology student who is scared of not living up to his late mother’s dreams of a better life for him.
Another student read a prepared speech for a peer who preferred to remain anonymous, describing how the insecurity of being both undocumented and queer ultimately led to staying in an abusive relationship and anxiety over being reported to law enforcement by the partner.
The letter also addressed the derogatory and detached language often associated with being undocumented, and noted that immigration status is “not an economic question, but rather [one of] lived narratives.”
In the weeks prior to the speak-out, Act on a Dream hung posters around campus featuring photos of students—some affiliated with the group, some not—marked with the text, “I could be undocumented.”
The campaign is part of Act on a Dream’s coalition with Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania to dispel misconceptions about what it means to be undocumented.
“We really wanted people who came from all kinds of backgrounds [to pose for the posters],” said Andrea Ortiz ’16, co-chair of Act on a Dream. “We had the vice president of PBHA and a freshman who is into ultimate Frisbee.”
Following the speak-out, the group put out a petition in favor of more comprehensive immigration reform. Harvard Law School professor Deborah E. Anker, who works on issues of immigration law, emphasized the significance of the speak-out and campaign in an age where immigration reform is an ongoing and evolving debate.
“You all are redefining not just what civil rights is, but what human rights is,” Anker said. Act on a Dream has identified many flaws in the current move to reform immigration, from the 13-year waiting period in order to gain equal citizenship to the lack of recognition for same-sex couples, according to Anahi D. Mendoza Pacheco ’15, an Act on a Dream member.
“Our political system encourages us to return to Mexico—a place we don’t know,” said Enrique Ramirez ’16. “To those who don’t support immigration reform... try my mom’s enchiladas. Stop dehumanizing.”

Researchers at the Harvard Kennedy School praised the efficacy of the response by medical and law enforcement officials to the Boston Marathon bombings in a paper published last week by the school’s Program on Crisis Leadership.
Faculty co-directors of the program Herman Dutch B. Leonard and Arnold M. Howitt commended the skilled and immediate responses from medical teams to treat victims of the bombings, which killed three and injured more than 170 at the finish line of one of Boston’s most celebrated annual sporting events. They identified nine factors contributing to the effectiveness of the medical response, including the locally situated personnel and high concentration of medical facilities in the city.
“A key feature of the response was that no one had to try to command it,” said Leonard. “The response unfolded by each of the people involved doing what they could see needed to be done.”
The paper also described how the involvement of federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies provided for an “extraordinary level of law enforcement cooperation,” according to Howitt.
The researchers highlighted that press releases by various officials throughout the week kept the public sufficiently informed and were particularly helpful in the process of identifying the suspects. Complete prevention of events such as the bombings, the paper suggested, is impossible. In fact, the researchers said that marathons are more susceptible to a terrorist attack than many other sporting events.
“Many sporting events take place in fixed venues around which a perimeter is placed to limit entry,” but “marathons have a roughly 55 mile perimeter, virtually none of which can be engineered to reliably limit access,” the paper read.
Leonard also cautioned against focusing too heavily on how this specific instance could have been prevented. “We need to be just as aware of the other possible kinds of threats,” he said.
In discussing continued research into the events, Leonard mentioned the citywide lockdown and the nature of the devices used in the attack as two of many topics to investigate.
He emphasized the importance of thoroughly analyzing tragedies in order to learn information “that will really help us in the future to minimize damage.” Citing improvement in crisis response over the last ten years, he added that he was hopeful research conducted now could be useful later.
“We need to keep working on it, but we need to recognize that we’ve already made some important progress,” Leonard said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As voters in the Commonwealth prepare to head to the polls on Tuesday to choose their parties’ nominees for the state’s open U.S. Senate seat, they will have to consider a number of education platforms ranging from consensus proposals to uniquely bold new ideas.
Though Massachusetts boasts public schools that are consistently ranked among the nation’s best, the five men vying to take Secretary of State John Kerry’s Senate seat have all proposed policies and platforms aimed at correcting flaws in the system. These include efforts to make K-12 education in public schools more effective and initiatives targeting college affordability.
Dems Together
In a campaign that has seen Reps. Stephen F. Lynch of South Boston and Edward J. Markey of Malden disagree on a wide array of issues that include health care, homeland security, and abortion, the two Democratic candidates have promoted largely similar education platforms.
Both men support a bill that would keep the federal student loan interest rate low, at 3.4 percent, and prevent it from doubling to 6.8 percent on July 1. Lynch and Markey also support the Race to the Top program, which provides additional federal education funding to states that adapt certain education policies. Massachusetts, the program’s top scoring state, was awarded $250 million by Race to the Top in 2010.
Both men have also supported education funding and development programs in the past.
In 1998, two years into his first term as a state senator, Lynch helped found the Boston Collegiate Charter School in Dorchester. BCCS serves local students in grades five through 12, and is filled by a lottery with admissions chances under 10 percent—even Lynch’s own daughters did not win a spot. BCCS offers a curriculum that focuses on proficiency in the STEM subjects emphasized by President Barack Obama’s own education platform—science, technology, engineering, and math. Since the school’s founding, 100 percent of BCCS graduates have earned admission to college, according to the school’s website.
Markey has also made notable contributions to education. Perhaps the most recognizable is the E-Rate program, a provision in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which Markey co-authored. The legislation has provided billions of dollars to schools looking to embrace basic connectivity technology.
Additionally, he has received endorsements from a number of education-driven groups, including the Massachusetts Teachers Association and the National Education Association.
Divided GOP
The landscape on the Republican side is far different. While all three candidates—State Rep. Daniel B. Winslow, former U.S. Attorney Michael J. Sullivan, and former US Navy Seal Gabriel E. Gomez—told The Crimson that they support keeping the federal student loan interest rate low, they have also outlined markedly different visions of education reform.
Winslow’s proposal for a new national lottery is the most bold. Revenue collected from lottery ticket sales would be directed to fund large increases in federal education support, including a doubling in the value of federal merit scholarships from $20 billion a year to $40 billion.
“This is really an effort to create an additional revenue source that is not debt-driven,” Winslow told The Crimson last week. “I want our students to be able to get through college and not be totally burdened by debt.”
The Winslow plan also targets the university system as a whole and particularly the increase in tuition costs, which have historically outpaced inflation. The plan would require universities that receive federal funding to keep a student’s tuition cost consistent with inflation for her four years at the school.
Despite Winslow’s ambitious objectives, Paul Moore, campaign manager for Sullivan, said that creating a new lottery is not as easy—or prudent—as it might sound.
“We don’t need any more lotteries,” he told The Crimson on Sunday, calling lotteries a “tax on the poor” because they feature unlikely odds and appeal to lower-income individuals. “This is a very bad idea from Dan Winslow.”
Scott Ahern, a spokesperson for Gomez, would not comment on the Winslow plan.
The polls open Tuesday morning at 7 a.m. The winners will face off in a special election on June 25.

Part One of a five-part series on Harvard's approaching capital campaign. Part Two was published on April 30, Part Three on May 1, Part Four on May 2, and Part Five on May 3.
UPDATED: May 1, 2013, at 10:05 a.m.
Since University President Drew G. Faust assumed her post in 2007, numerous initiatives have represented a strong push towards centralizing Harvard. From a University-wide calendar to centralized information technology services to creating a unified Harvard Library, major projects on campus have been geared towards transforming Harvard from a University characterized as 15 loosely-tied schools to a more cohesive and interconnected institution.
Now, as the University prepares for the public launch of a multi-billion dollar capital campaign, Harvard’s office of Alumni Affairs and Development, which is wrapping up a two-year “quiet phase,”  is working to incorporate centralization into the campaign.
“The major contribution of this campaign will not just be the money, it’s going to be this presentation of the many schools of Harvard as a single entity,” said Sidney R. Knafel ’52, a donor who has given tens of millions of dollars to the University.
While Faust’s goal, often phrased as “one University,” is a guiding principle of the upcoming capital campaign, different schools’ priorities, donors, and strategies complicate the ability to run a cohesive campaign.
The drive for a central mission originates partly in donor and alumni reaction to Harvard’s last University-wide capital campaign, vice president for alumni affairs and development Tamara E. Rogers ’74 said in an interview in mid-April. The previous campaign, a six-year endeavor that ended in 1999, raised $2.6 billion for the University.
“We found that alumni really were interested in seeing the totality of the institution,” Rogers said, calling the “breadth of what happens in the University” a “big, compelling story” for donors.
Rogers cited renewable energy and global health as topics that can be studied at multiple schools at Harvard. Alumni have come to expect interdisciplinary collaboration from the University, she said.
In an interview in early March, Faust discussed how inter-school study can incentivize donors as well. “If we have a donor that’s interested in global health, we want to make sure that they see all the different ways that might excite them,” she said. “We think they might do more if they see more.”
Even for “one University,” though, Harvard’s schools have different priorities, different donors, and different campaign strategies, and all of Harvard’s faculties remain “every tub on its own bottom.”
While an overarching campaign executive committee of the University’s biggest donors has been mapping out the structure and message of the campaign for several years, the dean of each school works with an individual committee of supporters to identify and refine school-specific priorities.
“We don’t want to homogenize the schools,” Rogers said in early December. “We do want them to have their strengths and their identities. That’s a strength of the University, but we also want to optimize all of these strengths for better teaching and [more robust] knowledge creation.”
Some University-wide priorities, such as financial aid or teaching and learning, apply to nearly all of Harvard’s schools. House renewal, on the other hand, is a top campaign priority that benefits the College exclusively.
Moving the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences to Allston is another example of a relatively school-specific goal that is a focus of the University’s central administration.
“We have big aspirations for its growth and its establishment as a school,” Faust said, adding that SEAS has a “special status.”
A difference in goals is not the only distinction that mandates different campaign strategies between schools. As Faust pointed out in an interview in early March, different alumni have different financial resources.
"We have to tailor our goals to a certain degree for the schools to what they are likely to be able to raise as well as what their dreams and aspirations might be,” Faust said.
She said that school size, which affects the size of a school's alumni base, could be a determining factor in the priorities that a school chooses for its campaign.
“Some of the smaller schools will have smaller goals,” she said. “They have fewer alums and often, alums who have not been as financially remunerated as others."
Like choosing campaign priorities, different schools’ processes of soliciting donations can overlap or even conflict. Donors may carry degrees from multiple schools at Harvard, or they may wish to contribute funds to a school that they did not attend.
Rogers emphasized the importance of coordinating the outreach of various schools to avoid duplicate efforts on the part of different offices and to direct donors towards projects where their contributions would be most useful.
“Basically we want to be as respectful as possible of our alumni so that they don’t feel as if people are coming to them from every direction without coordination,” Rogers said in December. “And so we realize it’s in our interest to coordinate.”
John A. Kaneb ’56, a donor who also serves on Harvard Medical School’s Board of Fellows, said that fundraising for a large University always comes with the question of which schools are allowed access to which donors—in other words, a centrally-coordinated effort versus what Kaneb described as more of a “free-market approach.”
“It can be quite competitive,” Kaneb said of different schools’ desire to reach the same donors. “Some would say chaotic.”
He said that the University’s central development office is working to manage potential conflict or overlap between different schools’ fundraising efforts.
“I would hope that they will do it with a light hand rather than a heavy hand,” Kaneb said. “I would hope it would not be over-managed.“
Rogers corroborated Kaneb’s sentiment, explaining that there are no written rules that dictate which donors schools may or may not contact for donations. Instead, collaboration is key.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: May 1, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the order in which University President Drew G. Faust made two statements about Harvard's strategy for its upcoming capital campaign. In fact, she spoke about tailoring goals to the unique circumstances of each of the University's schools before commenting on smaller schools specifically.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four seniors have been selected to deliver speeches at the annual Class Day ceremony on May 29, the Senior Class Committee announced on Sunday.
Damilare Sonoiki ’13 and Julie M. Zauzmer ’13, a former Crimson Managing Editor, will give serious and reflective talks as the Harvard Orators, and Phil M. Gillen ’13 and Blythe B. Roberson ’13 will deliver witty and lighthearted speeches as the Ivy Orators.
“All of them are incredible,” Second Class Marshal Scott J. Yim ’13 said of the chosen orators. “I’m incredibly excited for our speakers to grace the stage.”
Class Day, traditionally held the day before Commencement, represents the final opportunity before graduation for seniors to gather together as a full class. The Senior Class Committee chose the Harvard and Ivy Orators in a selection process that involved submission of written speeches, selection of finalists, and live auditions.
Roberson, one of the Ivy Orators, did her audition via Skype—and then learned of her selection an hour later.  Her speech, entitled “Driving a Car at Night, Choose Your Own Adventure, Step 1 of an Elaborate Plan to Go on a Date with the Lead Singer of Vampire Weekend,” is about finding a path to happiness.
Gillen, the other Ivy Orator, chose a more unorthodox topic for his talk. In an improv speech entitled “Tear Down This School,” Gillen will rhapsodize about destroying Harvard.
“I think the most important thing for all of us to do on Class Day is destroy Harvard,” Gillen said. “I don’t want to give away too many spoilers, but it’s a message we can all relate to. It’s a meaningful speech for a meaningful day. A lot of it is going to be off-the-cuff.”
Jokes notwithstanding, Gillen emphasized the importance of having student speakers at the Class Day celebration.
“All of [the non-student] speakers can give us advice and talk about what the rest of our lives are going to be like, but I think no one really gets what the Class of 2013 has been through as much as members of the Class of 2013,” Gillen said.
In a speech entitled “Curtain Call,” Zauzmer, one of the Harvard Orators, will address the different facets of graduation.
“It’s about graduations, and how there are many, many different moments of graduation, and how the ceremony isn’t necessarily the real one,” Zauzmer said of her speech.
While Yim said he was confident that the speakers’ messages “will resonate with everyone,” Gillen was more skeptical.
“I could pretty easily ruin a day that’s important for a lot of people,” Gillen joked.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Next September, every upperclassman house and freshman residential yard except Kirkland House will elect new Undergraduate Council representatives.
The potential lack of fall elections in Kirkland monopolized debate at Sunday’s UC meeting, during which Rules Committee Chair Christopher A. Smiles ’15 introduced two proposals aimed at giving rising sophomores in Kirkland an opportunity to have a say in UC representation.
Because all three UC representatives from Kirkland were elected as chairs—which constitutes a year-long term that ends at the end of fall semester—they will keep their seats through the fall elections, leaving no seats open to be challenged in the usual fall UC elections. Smiles called the absence of input until the spring a “disenfranchisement issue” for rising sophomores assigned to Kirkland.
“We feel that this issue is something that we should be talking about as a Council, so we decided that we present something outlining a couple of options,” Smiles said, explaining to the Council why the Rules Committee did not submit just one proposal.
The first proposal, a solution suggested by Elm Yard Representative Dhruv P. Goyal ’16, would change the Constitution of the UC so that there would “be at least one election for a representative seat in the fall of every term.” The affected House would then temporarily have four representatives until the next fall election. The second proposal would have all four executive officers—president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer—and all appointed chairs become at-large representatives the moment they are elected to their positions by the Council, opening up their House seats to be filled by new House representatives.
Supporters of the first proposal argued that it would maintain the current UC structure of each representative being responsible for a single house or yard.
“Even though [the Executive Board] does have responsibilities besides being a member of the house, part of the transition between serving on the committee is reaching out to your constituents,” said Kirkland House Representative and Student Initiatives Committee Chair Barr Yaron ’14. “I don’t like the idea of having that completely severed.”
Proponents of the second proposal argued that creating at-large posts would prevent the development of a Council where some Houses might have more representation than others. And a few representatives questioned aloud whether or not this “disenfranchisement” was actually an issue.
The Council ultimately decided to continue debate on the first proposal—and potentially vote to add another representative—at next week’s meeting. The second proposal was eliminated entirely.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a round of discussions led by administrators this past week, the Committee on Academic Integrity began a “consulting phase” to solicit feedback from members of the Harvard community on its proposal to create the College’s first ever honor code and establish a Student/Faculty Judicial Board for academic dishonesty cases.
In an emailed statement, Assistant Dean of Undergraduate Education Katherine Stanton wrote that the committee invited each House to host a discussion on the progress report in an effort to “hear a response from the entire academic community.”
As part of the initiative, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris also emailed the committee’s report directly to students on Friday, asking for their input through an online message board.
House Masters, Resident Deans, and members of the committee arranged meetings in Adams, Kirkland, Leverett, Currier, and Pforzheimer Houses last week and in Mather and Cabot Houses Sunday evening. The sessions marked the first opportunity for public scrutiny of the committee’s work, which began almost three years ago at the behest of the Committee on Undergraduate Education.
Several students who attended the meetings in their respective Houses expressed concerns regarding the creation of an honor code, with many saying that they did not believe it would change current trends of cheating and collusion at the College.
“In our discussion, the biggest issue with an honor code was that students would cheat not because they didn’t honor academic integrity, but  because they were over-committed,” said Raja F. Ghawi ’15, who was present at the Kirkland session. “Having an honor code won’t change that. You won’t really care about an honor code at 4 or 5 a.m.”
Ghawi added that having students commit to an honor code that they would eventually break defeats the purpose of the “declaration of integrity” outlined by the committee.
“Having people commit to an honor code that they’re probably going to break turns them into liars,” he said.
Harvard faced similar criticisms in 2011 when the Freshman Dean’s Office invited first-year students to sign a “freshman pledge,” which asked students to “commit to upholding the values of the College.”
Conversely, proponents of the honor code said that the measures outlined constituted a step in the right direction in the discussion on academic integrity.
“[An honor code] seems pretty successful in most places that use it,” said Samuel M. Meyer ’13, who is a Currier House Committee co-chair. “I don’t see a substantial problem with it.”
Darragh Nolan ’15, a student member of the committee who attended Kirkland’s meeting, said that he did not hear any constructive criticism leveled against the proposal.
“Students just said that this won’t work and it won’t change anything,” he said, emphasizing the importance of concrete suggestions on how the report could be improved.
Nolan said that the committee’s efforts to obtain community input on the report are part of a “consulting phase” in the adoption of the proposal, and not simply a response to recent events involving academic integrity such as the Government 1310 cheating scandal.
On the online forum, some students said that they were “impressed” by the proposal while others said that the University should recognize the role that apathetic instruction plays in promoting academic dishonesty.
Benjamin S. Raderstorf ’14 posted on the discussion board that he felt an honor code focused only on students was simply a “smokescreen” hiding “deeper problems” regarding academic integrity.
Nolan said that the committee does not have a specific time frame for finalizing the proposal. After community feedback is collected, the proposal will be modified again before being sent to the Committee on Undergraduate Education for approval, he said. To be officially included in the handbook, faculty must vote on the final proposal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has received a $50 million dollar gift for entrepreneurship in the life sciences from the Blavatnik Family Foundation, the University announced Monday morning.
The donation will fund the Blavatnik Biomedical Accelerator, a program designed to find promising biomedicine projects in their early stages and provide them with the resources to develop towards licensing.
The donation will also be used to create the Blavatnik Fellowship in Life Science Entrepreneurship Program at Harvard Business School, which will allow students to gain experience with biomedical innovation by working on Accelerator projects.
“By partnering with Harvard’s world-class biomedical research division, I am delighted to help accelerate the development of new therapies,” said Len Blavatnik, a graduate of the Business School who heads the foundation, in a press release. “Moreover, by increasing the collaborative efforts between Harvard Business School and Harvard’s scientific community, we will empower the next generation of life science entrepreneurs and provide a further catalyst for innovation and research development.”
The gift comes as a part of Harvard’s multi-billion dollar capital campaign, which is currently in its “quiet phase,” an early stage of soliciting donations before publicly announcing the campaign, which is scheduled to be announced publicly in September. At $50 million, the donation is one of the largest gifts to the University that has been made public in recent years.
In the press release, University President Drew G. Faust emphasized the donation’s potential to improve the commercial viability of biomedical projects that will benefit society at large.
“The Blavatnik Biomedical Accelerator and the integrated cross-university partnership it enables will advance the next great breakthroughs in biomedical technology, with its roots at Harvard,” Faust said.
The Accelerator will build on a similar existing fund at the Business School, which was also funded in part by the foundation. That fund has supported 37 projects since it was founded in 2007, according to the press release.

The Radcliffe Gymnasium will now be known as the Knafel Center, the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study announced on Thursday, following a recent $10.5 million gift from long-time University donor and venture capitalist Sidney R. Knafel ’52.
Knafel, whose donation will support the missions of both the Radcliffe Institute and Harvard University more broadly, said that he decided to direct funding toward the Institute because he feels he can make a difference for the relatively young institution.
“I’m not seeking publicity for myself,” said Knafel, who is a former Crimson business manager. “I’m seeking a more thoroughly thought-out understanding of what the Radcliffe Institute is.”
The Radcliffe Institute was founded in 1999, following the merger of the University and Radcliffe College. The Institute hosts an annual fellowship program for artists and scholars and also funds the work of researchers both within and outside of Harvard.
Knafel serves as co-chair of the Radcliffe capital campaign and as honorary co-chair of the University-wide capital campaign, which will launch this fall. He said that he became a supporter of the Institute soon after its establishment and is excited by the Institute’s ability to facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers around the world.
“It’s a wonderful place for Harvard to attract people outside of the Harvard orbit,” he said.
Radcliffe Dean Lizabeth Cohen praised Knafel’s gift in an emailed statement to The Crimson.
“It is wonderful, and wonderfully fitting, that the Radcliffe Gymnasium is now the Knafel Center, serving as the center of so much bold and creative work at the Radcliffe Institute and at Harvard,” she wrote. “We recognize that Sid thinks big and appreciate that with his most recent gift, he is inspiring us all to unite big thinkers across disciplines and boundaries to connect in new ways with one another and the public.”
The newly named Knafel Center is slated to undergo external renovations this summer.
Over the years, Knafel has donated tens of millions of dollars to Harvard. In 1996, he made a donation that contributed to the development of the Center for Government and International Studies’ Knafel Building.

Eight teams of finalists for the New Venture Competition will face off Tuesday for the final round of the student track of the Harvard Business School entrepreneurship contest.
The competition, which features separate tracks for students and alumni and for business and social enterprise, will grant more than $300,000 in cash prizes and in-kind support to winners.
The recently rebranded competition is sponsored by the Business School’s Arthur Rock Center for Entrepreneurship, the Social Enterprise Initiative, and Alumni Relations. Formerly divided into the student Business Plan contest and the alumni New Venture competitions, it is now in its 17th year.
At an event beginning at 4:30 p.m. in the Burden Auditorium on Tuesday, each of the eight finalist teams will deliver a business pitch to a panel of judges, and will have the opportunity to give an in-depth presentation about their ventures at the Spangler Center.
This year’s student business track finalists include Sensible Baby, a venture developing sensor-based technology that monitors babies while they sleep, and Astoria Road, a social wedding registry.
Muslimah “Muse” Bertoli, a member of the Astoria Road team, said that she appreciates the feedback loop that the competition provides.
“What the competition has given us is a support network,” Bertoli said, “We have been exposed to people that we otherwise wouldn’t talk to.”
Finalists in the student social enterprise track include Bluelight, which provides credit alternatives to households in the developing world, and Good Benefits, which helps companies conduct a workplace “401k for charity.”
Michael Schrader, co-founder and CEO of global health start-up Vaxess Technologies, won the 2012 student business track with his team by developing thermo-stable vaccine technology. According to Schrader, who returned this year to participate in the alumni track, the caliber of the competition and the judging standards are much higher on the alumni level than on the student level.
“The student competition is about a well-thought out plan, but the alumni competition is about a well-executed plan,” said Schrader.
James E. Aisner ’68, director of media relations at the Business School, emphasized the relationship-building component of the competition, saying that it allows students to form a cohesive team that transcends boundaries both within and outside of the University.
“The competition is a vehicle for accelerating innovation in business and society. It’s a journey that serves as a catalyst in many ways for students and alumni,” Aisner said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eleven months after negotiations began and nine months after their contract expired, representatives from the Harvard University Police Association expressed continued frustration with the stalled progress in their conversations with the University.
Harvard’s previous contract with HUPA—which represents approximately 56 Harvard University Police Department patrolmen—expired Aug. 1 of last year, and negotiations have continued since June. The largest disagreement between both groups centers on the size of the proposed wage increases.
The two sides met on Monday afternoon and issued a joint statement affirming their strong relationship and commitment to continuing the negotiations.
“We are confident that we can work together to reach an agreement that both recognizes the economic pressures facing the University and provides fair compensation to the respected and highly trained men and women of the Harvard University Police Department,” the statement read.
Yet no progress was made on the details of the contract.
A Harvard official who was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue indicated that the union’s current proposal is a three-year package that would result in a more than 20 percent wage increase. While representatives from the union would not disclose their exact proposals, HUPA President George R. White claimed that the University has refused to move from its proposal of a zero percent wage increase in the first year of the contract, to be followed by a one percent raise in the second, third, and fourth years.
“We have made repeated and significant moves in our position,” said Alan J. McDonald, the union’s attorney and chief negotiator. “We’ve tried to be creative, and we’re not being met with what we consider in-kind responses by the University.”
A University spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson that wages for the patrolmen are already high.
“Wages for the patrol officers are on par or ahead of the wages paid to officers at peer institutions and the major metropolitan police departments in our area,” the spokesperson wrote.
The last contract between HUPA and the University went into effect in August 2008. It included a four percent wage increase for each of the four years of the contract.
HUPA Vice President Michael Allen said that the University wanted to bring in a federal mediator to help resolve the negotiations, but that the mediator is unavailable until the end of May. He added that HUPA would prefer to bring in one of the mediators that worked on the resolved negotiations between the University and the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers earlier this year.
“They’re already up to speed on all the economic issues at hand,” White said. “Why not tap into all that knowledge?”

After a 4-3 upset loss to Brown on Thursday, the Ivy League title hung in the balance for the No. 21 Harvard men’s tennis team, which needed one win in its final two matches to clinch an outright conference championship. On Saturday, the Crimson (18-5, 6-1 Ivy) rebounded from the defeat in dramatic fashion by taking down Dartmouth, 6-1, to secure its second consecutive Ancient Eight title.
Harvard closed the Ivy season by demolishing the Big Green (9-14, 1-6 Ivy) on its home courts. The Crimson finished the season with a 6-1 conference mark for the second straight year and took its 13th victory in its last 14 matches.
“We’re feeling really great about clinching,” sophomore Alex Steinroeder said. “All of our hard work this year had paid off. It’s great to bounce back after Thursday’s tough loss, and a good way to end the Ivy season.”
The team, according to Steinroeder, feels that the adversity it faced after the disheartening loss to the Bears helped it refocus to take on Dartmouth.
“We did a good job on Friday at practice forgetting about Thursday,” he said. “Our goal was to come right back at them. We can’t necessarily control how we play, but we wanted to have a good attitude, lots of energy, and wanted to come out strong.”
On Saturday, Harvard achieved that last goal, immediately seizing control of the match. The Crimson put on the performance expected of a first-place team facing an opponent sitting in last place.
Harvard lost the doubles point for the first time in 13 matches on Thursday, but regained its strength in doubles on Saturday. All three duos jumped out to early breaks, and the No. 1 team of sophomore Denis Nguyen and junior co-captain Casey MacMaster, who are ranked 71st in the nation, were the first to close it out, 8-4.
Next, the second pair of co-captain Andy Nguyen and freshman Nicky Hu took an 8-4 win to clinch the doubles point, and Steinroeder and freshman Kelvin Lam also won on the third court.
The Crimson, already up 1-0, continued its momentum in singles. Both Steinroeder and sophomore Shaun Chaudhuri, playing at No. 2, opened with breaks. Chaudhuri converted his early advantage into Harvard’s first singles victory, putting the Crimson ahead 2-0 with a 6-3, 6-2 victory over his former high school teammate, the Big Green’s Chris Kipouras.
Andy Nguyen then took a straight-sets victory to put Harvard up 3-0 and improve his dual play record to 16-3 on the season. With the Crimson one victory away from the Ivy title, Denis Nguyen, playing at No. 1, took his first set, 7-5, and earned a break to go up 5-4 in the second set.
For the second straight year, Nguyen served for the Ancient Eight title and converted to finally secure the title for Harvard. After the match was clinched, Steinroeder and Hu both took their matches at the No. 4 and No. 5 spots, respectively, to make the score 6-0. MacMaster, playing on the sixth court, was losing when his match was halted, providing the final score of 6-1.
“The team is just elated,” Harvard coach Dave Fish said. “We came out of the blocks and went after it today. They were the hunters out there today. We’re all really happy and relieved.”
But the team still has more tennis and bigger goals to look forward to. The winner of the Ancient Eight receives an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament, which begins May 10.
Fish said that the loss to Brown has taught the team lessons that will better prepare it for NCAA play.
“Nobody comes through the season perfectly,” Fish said. “Sometimes, teams who go into the NCAA tournament undefeated lose early. They’re under pressure and haven’t experienced losing before. All of these things, good and bad, go into making a great season. You can’t just go jumping from mountaintop to mountaintop and expect to grow.”
The team feels well-prepared for the tournament, and has some specific goals in mind.
“A lot of us are back from last year’s team, and know what it takes,” Steinroeder said. “Last year, we reached the second round. This year, our goal is to get to the Sweet 16. We’re going to have a good few weeks of practice and hopefully a good showing.”

Competing at the Collegiate Water Polo Association Eastern Tournament in Ann Arbor, Mich., the Harvard women’s water polo team entered seeded sixth and finished in the same spot after going 2-2 on the weekend.
After defeating Notre Dame (Ohio) in the first matchup, the Crimson (18-16, 3-3 CWPA) was eliminated from title contention by third-seeded Hartwick. Harvard played two consolation games in the next two days, winning one and losing the next to secure a sixth-place finish.
Princeton emerged victorious out of the field of 12 to lock up a berth in the NCAA Championships.
The split marked the end of Harvard’s season as the team finished two games over .500 and amassed the highest win total in Harvard coach Ted Minnis’s three years with the team. The Crimson will lose co-captains Aisha Price and Elise Molnar to graduation.
“I can’t say enough about this group of girls, from top to bottom, from the seniors down to the freshmen,” Minnis said. “It’s probably the closest team I’ve ever coached in my twenty-odd years of coaching.”
BROWN 18, HARVARD 9
In the fifth-place game, Brown (18-20) outscored Harvard in each period to win by nine goals, handing the Crimson its third loss of the year against the Bears.
While Brown never had a dominant period, it outscored Harvard by one in the first period and three in the second to build a four-goal lead entering halftime. Five Brown tallies in the third quarter put the Crimson in a seven-goal hole from which it would never recover.
Junior Shayna Price led the team with four goals. Her sister, Aisha Price, found the back of the net once in her final collegiate game.
“It’s hard to lose to Brown for the third time this season,” Aisha Price said. “But each year goes onto the next and I know the team will come back stronger next year.”

The Crimson notched an 11-9 victory over the Colonials (16-17) in its only game on the second day of play by outlasting them in the closing minutes.
Harvard found itself up seven goals with just fewer than seven minutes remaining in the game, but GW went on a scoring spree, adding five consecutive tallies to cut the margin to two. Luckily for the Crimson, the clock ran out on the game and the earlier insurance goals came in handy.
Aisha Price posted a team-high four goals in the game. Sophomore Ariel Dukes made a number of big saves in net to total 14 on the game and preserve the lead for Harvard.
The Crimson slowly built up a lead over the first three periods of play. Up one goal after the first quarter, the Crimson outscored the Colonials by two and three goals, respectively, in the next two periods to build a lead of six entering the fourth period and notch the team’s third win of the season against GW.
HARTWICK 20, HARVARD 6
After winning its first game of the tournament, the Crimson could not keep pace with third-seeded Hartwick (29-12) and fell by a decisive score of 20-6.
The Hawks produced consistently throughout the contest, and Harvard found itself down, 10-3, entering halftime. The second half proceeded in the same manner as the first, and both teams scored the same number of goals as they did in the first half to seal the loss for the Crimson.
Sophomore Kalina Grabb was the only player to tally multiple goals in the defeat, which eliminated the Crimson from the possibility of an NCAA tournament berth. Dukes contributed a team-high four steals and four saves in net.
HARVARD 15, NOTRE DAME (OHIO) 4
The Crimson got off to a fast start in its first game of the tournament, defeating the Falcons (6-16) by an 11-goal margin.
A strong defensive effort from Harvard carried the team to victory. Five different players registered three steals in the game and the four goals allowed represented the team’s second best performance on the year.
Harvard’s defense and offense both shone in the first half, and the team entered the locker room up, 9-1, buoyed by seven goals in the first period. A five-goal fourth quarter put the game away for the Crimson.
Freshman Charlotte Hendrix led the way with a game-high four goals.
“I think we had a great season,” Minnis said. “I definitely feel like it was a great year regardless that we didn’t get the NCAA bid.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Heading into the final weekend of play, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team faced off against the Big Green in Hanover, N.H. on Friday. Although the Crimson (3-11, 2-5, Ivy) held a one-point lead entering halftime, No. 20 Dartmouth (9-6, 5-2, Ivy) outscored Harvard, 10-2, in the second frame to win, 15-8.
Dartmouth took an early lead, scoring in the first 45 seconds of the contest. The Big Green’s offense proceeded to net two more goals in the following five minutes to gain a 3-0 advantage.
Freshman attack Audrey Todd sparked Harvard’s offense, opening the scoring for the Crimson with two unassisted goals in less than a minute’s time.
“We have a good core to build from,” Harvard coach Lisa Miller said. “We played a lot of freshmen this year, and that’s a good thing for the program.… I think we started to play a little bit differently this year. We’re moving the ball around a lot more, and I think that’s a good thing for future teams.”
Heading into the final 20 minutes, Cyr netted a goal to tie the score, 3-3. The Big Green responded with a goal to regain the lead when Dartmouth’s freshman midfielder Jaclyn Leto fired a shot past Crimson senior goalie Mel Cook on a free-position attempt.
“We started [the] game great, and I thought they attacked something we were trying to work out defensively,” Miller said. “We’re getting better and better at it. We’re really young on the crease, and I thought Dartmouth did a really good job of taking advantage.”
The Harvard offense executed another three-goal surge, bumping itself ahead, 6-4. The first look came from senior midfielder Danielle Tetreault, who found the back of the net unassisted. Junior midfielder Kyleigh Keating netted a goal after junior attack Chelsey Newman fed her the ball heading into the final five minutes of the period. Tetreault buried another shot to extend the lead with three minutes remaining.
“We’re a threat all over the field,” Tetreault said. “There’s no one attacker that scores our goals. We are very balanced, and that makes it hard for other teams to defend us.”
Capitalizing on a man-up opportunity, Dartmouth tallied the final goal of the first frame, bringing the score to 6-5.
The Crimson lead did not last long, with the Big Green notching a goal in a man-down situation to level the score. The goal came from Dartmouth junior attack Liz Calby, who registered another goal in the fourth minute to snag a lead for the Big Green.
“I thought when we had the ball, we scored,” Miller said. “We did have long defensive stands, but when you don’t have the ball, it’s tough to win. And that’s the story of the game.”
The Harvard offense answered the two Dartmouth goals with two of its own to regain the lead, 8-7. Senior midfielder Nina Kucharczyk tallied the tying point with an unassisted goal. Todd registered a hat-trick and helped keep pace with the Big Green, but the goal was the last of the contest for the Crimson. Todd’s hat-trick was her fourth for the season.
In the next 23 minutes, Dartmouth dominated possession, tallying the next and final eight points of the match. The Big Green’s senior attack Hana Bowers pocketed three goals in three minutes to extend Dartmouth’s lead to two points. Leto and Calby each netted a goal, along with senior midfielder Courtney Bennett and freshman attack Gabby Starkey.
“We came out in the first half…it was a goal-for-a-goal game,” Tetreault said. “Second half, the draw controls didn’t go our way, and draw controls are possessions, and those are goals, so we went 10-2 for draw controls in the second half, and they went 10-2 against us in goals.”
“We just could not get to a draw control, and I think that is what determined the game,” Miller added. “We were in and around it, we just weren’t coming up with it.”
Todd led the team in goals for the match. Newman and Kucharczyk each registered an assist, and Cook tallied five saves for the Crimson.
The Big Green outshot Harvard, 27-17, and controlled 17 of the 24 draw controls in the match.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Sunday afternoon, six Harvard seniors took to the field at Harvard Stadium for their final game in Crimson uniforms on Senior Day.
Harvard (3-11, 2-5 Ivy) defended its home turf against Columbia (3-12, 0-7) in the team’s Ivy and season finale. After battling back and forth for possession, the Crimson squad was able top the Lions, 18-11, thanks to a second half surge.
Junior midfielder Kyleigh Keating opened the scoring in the contest with a goal assisted by captain midfielder Micaela Cyr.
Columbia responded with three consecutive goals from two seniors, each unassisted, to bring the score to 3-1.
“I think adjusting to the other team and what they throw at us [was a challenge],” senior midfielder Danielle Tetreault said. “I think they shut down a few of our strengths early on, and we learned to kind of navigate around that and come back.”
Freshman attack Audrey Todd netted a free-position shot less than two minutes later to curb the Lions’ three-goal momentum to help Harvard close the scoring gap. Cyr notched another assist after dishing the ball to freshman Alexis Nicolia, who pocketed the Crimson’s third goal of the match.
A drive to the net from senior midfielder Nina Kucharczyk put Harvard ahead, 4-3, heading into the final ten minutes of the first half.
“I mean in our game, if you have the ball, you’re winning,” Crimson coach Lisa Miller said. “I think we were really balanced and were moving the ball around well.”
Columbia tallied two free-position shots, the first of which came in a man-up situation to regain the lead.
In the final three minutes of the opening frame, Nicolia netted an unassisted goal and Tetreault executed a free-position goal to send Harvard into halftime with a one-goal lead, 6-5.
“I thought we did well,” Miller said. “We did well in the draw circle. I thought we did a better job defensively down on the crease.”
Harvard opened the second half with a quick offensive attack, scoring three goals in three minutes. Tetreault tallied a goal from a free-position shot, her first goal of four in the contest.
Two more unassisted goals coming from Cyr and senior midfielder Mariel Jenkins put the Crimson ahead, 9-5.
“We distributed the ball on attack, which the attack has been doing a good job with,” Miller said. “Overall it was just a good team game.”
Columbia snuck in a goal to bring its deficit to three goals.
“We know they’re a team that attacks from the crease, so we were aware of that and were trying to shut that down as much as possible,” Tetreault said.
The Crimson responded with another three-goal surge. Tetreault pocketed her second goal of the contest and junior attack Chelsey Newman notched two goals, one from a free-position opportunity and the next from an unassisted drive.
Despite the Lions’ finding the net heading into the final 20 minutes, Harvard’s lead steadily increased for the duration of the match.
“I think [Sunday] went really well,” Tetreault said. “We had a game plan, and we went out and executed it. The beginning of the game was a fight, like any Ivy League game is, and then I think we slowly put them away one-by-one.”
Todd chipped in an unassisted goal, and Tetreault drilled two more in the back of the net to bring her final tally to four for the game. Keating, Todd and freshman midfielder Meghan Bauer tallied the final three points for the Crimson for the victory, with the final score being 18-11.
Leading the Crimson in goals with four, Tetreault landed in the ninth-ranked spot in program history for career goals, with 114. Todd secured a hat trick, and Cyr notched a career-high four assists. Cyr also picked up a team-high two groundballs along with freshman Izzy Wager.
“[The seniors] have done a great job the four years that they’ve been here, and I think they’ve established a high standard in practice and they compete all the time,” Miller said. “It was a tough year in terms of record, but I thought we were in all the games and I just think the senior class—I really am going to miss them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With its 6-1 victory over Dartmouth (8-10, 1-6), the Harvard women’s tennis team (13-6, 5-2) wrapped up a late season run that was too little, too late for the team’s Ivy League championship hopes. Despite winning four in a row to close out the year—including a 5-2 home victory over then-no. 35 Yale—the team finished third in the Ivy League, doomed by two early season losses.
“We are very fortunate to be in a very competitive league,” coach Traci Green said. “A lot of the top teams were very close in level and I know our team sees that and believes that. On any given day, any given team can beat anyone and that’s a very realistic mindset.”
Both of the Crimson’s losses during Ivy League play came by close 4-3 margins, with Princeton and eventual champion Columbia taking the deciding singles match in the third set each time. Against Columbia, a final set tiebreaker was needed to decide the contest; had it gone the other way, Harvard would be the league champion.
“The season as a whole was definitely very emotional,” freshman Hai-Li Kong said. “We were already really close but it was an amazing bonding month. We ended the season on a high note with those wins against Brown and Dartmouth and ending with that winning streak was good.”
On Saturday, the Crimson got off to a quick early start by sweeping the doubles contests. Co-captain Hideko Tachibana, playing her last match in a Crimson uniform, and freshman Amanda Lin triumphed 8-2 at line one and co-captain Kristin Norton and sophomore Sylvia Li clinched the doubles point with an 8-4 victory over their Big Green opponents. Kong and junior Hannah Morrill were up a break, 7-5, over the Big Green’s Jeri Reichel and Juienne Keong when play was stopped.
In singles, two freshmen continued their double digit winning streaks with straight set victories. After a tight 6-4 first set, Kong won her 12th straight match going away by blanking her opponent in a 6-0 second set. Lin surrendered just three games in her 15th straight victory, defeating Dartmouth’s Christina Danosi, 6-1, 6-2. Lin finished the season with 26 wins in her 29 matches, including a 16-1 record in dual matches for the team and an undefeated 7-0 record in Ancient Eight play.
At lines one and three, respectively, Tachibana and Norton ended their careers on high notes with straight-set wins over their Dartmouth opponents. Norton broke her opponent late in the first set to take it by a 7-5 margin, using a pair of breaks in a 6-2 second to clinch the victory. Tachibana allowed just four games in her victory over Dartmouth’s Katherine Yau to finish 10-8 at the top line for the Crimson on the year.
“It was a very collective effort,” Kong said. “It wasn’t a clincher (4-3) match but everyone played really well. The seniors were playing their hearts out because it was their last match. They were the ones that clinched our doubles match and that was great.”
During their four years on the team, Tachibana and Norton never won an Ivy League championship, finishing in the top four their freshman and senior years. Over their careers, the team won 47 matches and lost only 30, including a 13-6 record in 2013. Playing together as a doubles team this year, the pair ended the season with a 7-3 match record at line one, with all other combinations the Crimson put at the top line going a combined 2-6 at the same position.
Despite never having won an Ancient Eight title, Green said that the two seniors played very important roles in shaping the culture of the program and in mentoring the younger players. According to Green, this mentoring helped younger players like Lin, Kong, and He—who went a combined 33-6 for the Crimson during dual matches and 19-2 during Ivy League matches—develop over the course of the season.
“Kristin and Hideko definitely left their mark and left a huge impact on the culture of the team,” Green said. “They are both hugely valuable to their team. Their team loves and respects them and it is very heartwarming to see the type of leadership they exude every day in practice and matches. The future looks bright for us and that’s in large part due to the work that our seniors put in.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its final Ivy League doubleheader of the season, the Harvard baseball team battled against Dartmouth, the newly crowned champs of the Red Rolfe Division, but was unable to pull out a victory.
Playing on a clear Sunday afternoon at O’Donnell Field on Senior Day, the Crimson (10-30, 7-13 Ivy) scored first in both games but could not hold on in later innings. Harvard dropped the first game, 4-2, and the Big Green (31-7, 15-5) strung together rallies in game two to notch a five-run win.
The two losses secured third place for the Crimson in its four-team division.
“Obviously our chance at winning an Ivy League title was done,” freshman catcher DJ Link said. “Coming in today, especially as an underclassman, on Senior Day we wanted to give a really good effort for the seniors who have been through the program.”
DARTMOUTH 9, HARVARD 4
In the second game of the day, the Crimson got a good start but could not hold off the Big Green offense in the later innings.
Dartmouth scored all nine of its runs in the sixth, seventh, and eighth innings to take the lead for good, and although Harvard responded with three runs in the bottom of the eighth, the Big Green still managed to complete the sweep.
Senior Michael Johnson threw six innings and earned the win for Dartmouth, improving his record to 7-0 on the year. Junior Baron Davis started on the hill for Harvard and pitched into the seventh inning, but was tagged with the loss after surrendering four earned runs in the game.
The Big Green got on the board with two runs in the sixth, and Dartmouth tacked on four additional tallies in the next half-inning on as many hits.
Co-captain reliever Jordan Haviland, who entered the game in the seventh, was replaced by senior Matt Doyle in the top of the eighth, but the Big Green offense scored three more times, keyed by a two-run double by junior Shane Ogren.
Harvard did not go down without a fight, and in the bottom of the eighth inning, sophomore Mike Martin smacked a double down the left field line to bring home a run. A few batters later, a bases-loaded walk to sophomore infielder Tanner Anderson plated one more, and Link added an RBI single to cap the three-run inning.
“We produced; we got guys on base against some really good pitchers,” Link said. “I think we battled at the plate, and we put balls in play and found some holes. There were just a few situations where we had runners on and just couldn’t get that one hit.”
Davis was very effective in the first five innings of play, allowing zero runs and only a single hit. But the only support he received during that time was an RBI single from Anderson in the bottom of the first.
DARTMOUTH 4, HARVARD 2
In a seven-inning game that lasted just over an hour and twenty minutes, the Big Green came back from an early deficit to claim its third victory on the weekend.
The Crimson jumped out to a one-run lead in the third, but Dartmouth responded with a three-run fourth inning to seize a lead that it would never give up.
Each team used only one pitcher, and both starters worked efficiently. Anderson surrendered four runs—just one earned—on six hits, but he did not receive enough offensive support to avoid the loss.
“We knew going into the game it was more of a pride thing,” Doyle said. “They had good starting pitching performances…. Finally we started to see the ball a little better; it took a little long but that’s probably the story of the year. We have the pitching sometimes and the hitting doesn’t come, and then it flip flops. But for us, it’s definitely just a learning point especially for next year going forward.”
Harvard got the scoring started in the third, when freshman outfielder Matt Sanders reached second base after the Dartmouth third baseman airmailed a throw over the first baseman’s head. After a strikeout, junior outfielder Carlton Bailey lined a pitch to left field to pick up the RBI.
But the Big Green bounced right back in the next frame, scoring three times on three hits. The Crimson made two errors in the inning, including a bobbled groundball in the infield that resulted in a run.
Dartmouth added an additional earned run in the top of the fifth to push the lead to 4-1. In the bottom of the sixth, Harvard got the run back on a double from sophomore outfielder Brandon Kregel in the left-center gap. But the Crimson could not tack on any more runs in the frame, and the team went down in order in the bottom of the seventh to seal the loss.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It just took one win over Harvard baseball this past weekend for Dartmouth to secure the Red Rolfe Division and head to the Ivy League Championship Series for the sixth straight year. The Big Green got it done early, taking both games in Saturday’s double-header in Hanover, N.H.
The Crimson (10-30, 7-13 Ivy), which entered the weekend second in its division, lost a close one to Dartmouth (31-7, 15-5) Saturday morning when a late-game double by the home team broke the tie and brought home two runners.
Its fate already sealed for championship play, the Crimson was held scoreless through nine in the second game and lost, 8-0.
DARTMOUTH 8, HARVARD 0
The game was scoreless until the bottom of the fourth, when the home team brought in four runs against Harvard freshman starter Sean Poppen.
Dartmouth relied on three RBI singles in the inning from Joe Purritano, Trent Goodrich and Matt Parisi. A sacrifice fly from catcher Matt MacDowell added another tally for the Big Green.
In the bottom of the sixth, a sacrifice single and wild pitch earned two more runs for Dartmouth. The final blow came in the eighth with a two-run double from junior Dustin Selzer.
Offensively, the Crimson could not deliver.
“A lot of people have been struggling with offense, which was huge in game two,” sophomore Brandon Kregel said. “We had six hits, but we need to find out how to string the hits together and actually drive the baseball. We really need to get behind it instead of just relying on poking the ball through.”
On the mound for Dartmouth for most of the game was senior Kyle Hunter, who struck out five Crimson batters. Big Green pitchers totaled eight strikeouts in the game.
“They had a pretty good pitcher,” freshman third baseman Mitch Klug said. “He was doing a good job of getting ahead and putting us in not-so-good hitter’s counts.”
After the decisive first game, the motivation and energy levels were down for the Crimson.
“In the second game, we rolled out of the first loss [and] we could kind of tell that it was affecting us a little,” Klug said. “After the second game we realized that even though [Sunday’s] games won’t decide whether we play next weekend, we can really improve from how we played in the second game.”
DARTMOUTH 3, HARVARD 1
Dartmouth scored first on Saturday on a fielding error by Harvard shortstop Mike Martin in the bottom of the second.
Harvard was able to tie up the score in the fourth with an RBI double to right-center by Kregel.
“I think we came out ready to play in the first game,” Klug said. “I thought in the first couple innings we put a good effort out there.”
Klug produced one of just three hits for the Crimson. Offense was hard to come by for both teams as Dartmouth manage just five hits of its own.
MacDowell put the ball through to centerfield for a two-run RBI double in the fourth to put the Big Green up, 3-1. With three more opportunities on offense, Harvard wasn’t able to respond.
“We didn’t really execute when we needed to come back and answer in key situations,” Kregel said.
On the mound, senior Sam Dodge pitched all seven innings. In the 31 at-bats he faced, 60 percent of his pitches were strikes, including six strikeouts.
“Dodge was pitching well, and I thought we were playing pretty well behind him,” Klug said.
After closing out the Ivy League season against Dartmouth, Harvard’s regular season will finish with a Monday night game at Fenway Park against Boston College.
“We’re coming to the end of the season and we’re really just grinding our bats out, and just grinding plays out, one by one,” Kregel said. “Our team is just exhausted at this point, to the extent that we have to put pitchers in regular positions on the field.”
The Crimson dedicated its final home game to its seniors, but the true memorial was for former coach Joe Walsh, who died over the summer.
“He was such an inspiration to everybody, including myself, when he was here,” Kregel said. “It would be nice for everyone to remember him when we play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two freshmen led the Harvard men’s golf team as the squad closed out its season at the Ivy League Championship this weekend at the Caves Valley Golf Club in Maryland.
Heading into the final day of competition, freshman Un Cho sat in fourth place individually, just three shots from the title spot.
“Un played extremely well the first two days,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “He was sick, fighting a fever and an infection and yet he still played amazingly the first two days.”
Battling illness, Cho had a shakier third round that included a penalty point for an error on the last hole. Cho shot a nine-over 79 to drop to 12th place, just outside of the top 10. Cho was Harvard’s top finisher as the team took sixth place in the Ancient Eight contest.
“His body got a bit tired the last round so that’s too bad,” Rhoads said. “He did come back really nicely in the third round and put a nice score and that’s including a penalty for something inadvertent on the last hole.”
Stamina and pacing proved key as champion Princeton closed out the tournament with a weekend-low third round score of 288. Rookie of the Year Quinn Prchal was one of two players to finish the final round one under par, as he helped the Tigers win the championship with the lowest overall score since 2009 and edge out second-place Yale by five shots. Prchal’s teammate Greg Jarmas captured the individual title with a score of 213, just three shots over par and 11 shots better than Cho.
Cho was followed by fellow freshman Rohan Ramnath, who bounced back from a tough first day to finish in 21st place. Ramnath encountered trouble on the final hole of his first round, hitting a quadruple-bogey for a round that went 11-over par. The rookie struggled with his short game early.
“I’d say the first two days I didn’t really putt all that well,” Ramnath said. “I didn’t really make any short putts and I wasn’t really leaving my long putts close, so I struggled a little bit with the putter.”
Despite early difficulty, Ramnath fought back over the next two rounds, hitting eight over par through the rest of the weekend.
“I think I played pretty well for the most part all three days, except the first day I just had one or two shots that cost me big time,” Ramnath said.
Junior captain Theodore Lederhausen and classmate Michael Lai, along with sophomore Akash Mirchandani, rounded out the team, all finishing within six strokes of Ramnath. Lederhausen shot two above Ramnath with a score of 231, while Lai, in his first Ivy Championship appearance, was just a stroke behind at 232.
The team, which graduated two key seniors from the Class of 2012, fell back two spots from its fourth place finish last year.
“I’d be lying if I had said we were happy about our performance,” Ramnath said. “We’ve put in a lot of work this season and we were hoping it would pay off at Ivies but it didn’t quite get there. We’re looking forward to next year.”
Turnover of key players was not a problem unique to the Crimson. Penn and Dartmouth, who tied for the title last season, fell to third and fifth place, respectively.
The tournament was held in Owings Mills, M.D., a considerable distance south of any Ivy school, bringing more favorable conditions, but a definite change from the chill of Cambridge.
“The greens were really fast, probably the fastest greens we played on our year,” Ramnath said. “The practice round on the first day took us a little bit of time to get used to them because the greens up in Boston haven’t been that fast recently because of the long winter. They were challenging but definitely fair.”
The team will return its full five-man roster next season, and the crop of young talent, as shown by the strong freshman finishes, holds promise for the coming year.
“Both of us [freshmen] put in a lot of work this year,” Ramnath said. “We’re very committed. The fact that we were the two highest finishers on the team shows that we’ll only get better as the years go own. We’re very excited for the new freshmen next year and we know they’ll be giving us a run for our money.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The women’s golf Ivy League Championships came down to the last putt. Freshman Christine Lin sank it to give Harvard a one-stroke victory over Princeton for the Crimson’s second straight Ivy League team title.
After leading her team to the Ivy team title, Lin played a one-hole playoff for the individual title against the Ivy League Player of the Year, junior Kelly Shon of Princeton.  Lin shot a one-under final round to catch Shon at two-over for the weekend, but the freshman lost by one stroke in the playoff.
Despite the runner-up finish, Lin’s excellent final round helped the Crimson defend the team title. The freshman was the only golfer to shoot under par on the day and earned Ivy Rookie of the Year honors for her consistent play.
On the weekend, Harvard finished with an overall score of 909 (+45), just ahead of Princeton (+46). Yale (+66), Columbia (+80), and Penn (+90) rounded out the top five at the tournament.
The Tigers and the Crimson separated themselves from the field fairly early in the weekend, making it a two-team fight in round three on Sunday for the championship.
Harvard entered the final round with a five-shot lead over Princeton, but Tiger freshman Alexandra Wong shot a final round 75 (+3) to move up five spots and help Princeton challenge the Crimson on the final few holes.  Harvard held a one shot lead as the final pairing of the day, Lin and Shon, teed off on the 18th. The Crimson went on to win as both players bogeyed the final hole.
“We just wanted to come out [on Sunday] and play the same way we had been all weekend,” said Harvard junior captain Bonnie Hu, who is also a Crimson business editor. “As a team, we did a really good job of treating Sunday like any other round of golf.”
Harvard was able to maintain the lead on Sunday with freshman Courtney Hooton shooting a 75 (+3) and sophomore Tiffany Lim shooting a 77 (+5) to back up Lin’s 71. The Crimson finished the day with a team total of 304.
After round one on Friday afternoon, Harvard held a three-shot lead over the Tigers. The Crimson finished with 304 strokes on the round behind strong play from Lin, who shot 73 (+1) and Hu, who finished with 74 (+2). Hu, who won the Ivy individual title last season, followed up her strong first round with another 74 on Saturday to help Harvard extend its lead against Princeton.
Lin and Hooton earned All-Ivy first team honors while Hu was named to the second team.
“One of the things we tried to focus on this weekend was being patient,” Hu said. “We knew coming in the course was going to be really tough, so we had to have the mindset that every shot could be the difference.”
Overall, the Crimson had its best team round on Saturday, shooting 13-over to tie for the lowest single-round score for any team all weekend. Hooton shot the lowest score for the Crimson on Saturday with a 73 (+1) with Lin one behind her at 74 (+2). Sophomore Brenna Nelsen, who is also a Crimson sports editor, shot her lowest score of the weekend at 81 (+9). The sophomore was coming off a foot injury that forced her to withdraw from the team’s competition at the Brown Invitational two weeks ago.
After the loss to Yale at the Brown Invitational, Harvard needed a win at the Ivy League Championships to earn a bid to the NCAA Regional Championships. With that goal in mind, the team tried to refocus in practice and ignore the pressure.
“Enjoying the atmosphere and the ability to be at the Ivy Championships is a huge part of ignoring the pressure and was something our coaches talked about coming in,” Lin said. “We couldn’t let the pressure affect our play because we only get four of these and it is a special tournament and a cool experience.”
Though it was Lin’s clutch final putt that officially gave Harvard an automatic berth to the regional championships, an event that it finished 16th at last season, the Crimson’s narrow margin of victory—a single stroke—demonstrated the importance of every shot by all five members of the squad.
“It is a really tough golf course and our coaches just told us to play our own game,” Lin said. “I think we were able to come out and do that each day, and I am just really excited for the entire team that we are able to move on to regionals.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard softball team entered the weekend needing to take three of four from Dartmouth in a home-and-home series to play for the Ivy League Championship Series next weekend. After a Saturday doubleheader in Hanover, N.H, the Crimson (22-22, 12-8 Ivy) was still in the hunt for the North Division title as it split its two games with the division-leading Big Green (25-18, 15-5 Ivy).
DARTMOUTH 7, HARVARD 1
After a commanding performance from freshman pitcher Morgan Groom in game one, the Crimson was unable to keep the defensive pressure going in the second leg of the doubleheader.
Harvard yielded 11 hits and six RBIs in its largest loss of its conference season before Sunday.
Freshman Jamie Halula and sophomore Gabrielle Ruiz split time pitching, giving up six and five runs, respectively.
Freshman Morgan McCalmon led the Big Green with three runs. McCalmon and sophomore Kristen Rumley each recorded three hits, and five other Dartmouth batters contributed a hit.
The Big Green broke through with two runs in the bottom of the second off a sacrifice fly from freshman Kelsey Miller with runners on second and third. Miller’s fly-out drove in classmate Katie McEachern from third base, and a Crimson error at third allowed McCalmon to advance two bases to score.
Dartmouth went on to record two-run innings in the fourth and sixth, in addition to a run scored on an RBI triple in the fifth from Miller.
The Big Green scoring spree included a homer to center  from senior Hillary Hubert, who drove in sophomore pitcher Kristen Rumley.
Harvard recorded as many hits—five—as it had in game one, but struggled this time to convert those into runs. Senior Jessica Ferri was the only Crimson player to score on the day.
She came in on a sacrifice fly from sophomore Adrienne Hume in the fifth frame.
HARVARD 4, DARTMOUTH 1
Junior Kasey Lange broke the all-time Harvard career home run record as the Crimson opened Saturday’s doubleheader with a 4-1 win over the Big Green.
Lange hit her 29th career home run and 12th of the season in the top of the fourth to give Harvard a 1-0 lead. Lange leads the Ancient Eight this season with 43 runs batted in.
“She’s a gamer. She plays the game to win,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said of Lange. “When she’s on the field, there’s a different energy on the field. She’s been a great leader on the field.”
Freshman Haley Davis followed up the record-breaking performance in the next inning with a homer of her own, and a single from junior captain Shelbi Olson four at-bats later drove in a pair of runs.
On the mound, Groom turned in another commanding pitching performance. After recording a one-hitter last week against Brown, Groom finished Saturday having surrendered six hits, zero earned runs and accumulating a career-high nine strikeouts.
“I think that she pleasantly surprised a lot of people,” Davis said of Groom. “She’s been working so hard and has made such a huge improvement on the whole. Coming into this season, all the hard work in the training room and extra hours of pitching has really shown. She has stepped up and fulfilled her role when we really needed her to.”
Dartmouth’s lone run came in the bottom of the seventh off an error from sophomore Crimson shortstop Emily Gusse.
The victory gave Harvard a chance to catch Dartmouth in the Ivy League North Division standings on Sunday as the two conference rivals traveled back to Cambridge for their final regular season double-header. After the Crimson dropped game two on Saturday, Allard was still comfortable with her team’s position heading into two must-win home games Sunday.
“Our goal [Saturday] was to bring it back and make [Sunday] matter, and we met that goal,” Allard said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard softball team came into Sunday knowing it needed to win both games in order to advance to the Ivy League Championship Series. After losing to Brown last week due to an error-filled seventh inning, it was a close, hard fought loss this week that prevented the Crimson from returning to the ILCS for the fourth-straight year.
The disappointing doubleheader brought to a close a season which came down to the last day. Although there were many tears from the players at the end of the game, Harvard coach Jenny Allard was very proud of her team for its performance.
“I think you define success in many ways,” Allard said. “My goal every year is to have them overachieve, and this year they overachieved.  They were resilient which was characteristic of our seniors who came out and led everyday.”
DARTMOUTH 13, HARVARD 1
After the loss in the first game, the Crimson knew its season was over. A run in the bottom of the first put Harvard up 1-0 and made it look like it would hang tough and finish the season on a positive note.
But the Big Green Machine turned the score on its head. Over the next four innings, Dartmouth put 13 runs on the board, enacting the mercy rule after five.
Freshman Jamie Halula started for the Crimson. After holding the Big Green scoreless in the first, Dartmouth jumped out in front in the top of second with a three-run home run from senior Katie Adams giving the Big Green a 3-1 lead. An RBI single by senior Morgan Wharton brought the score to 4-1.
Another home run in the top of the third gave Dartmouth a 6-1 lead as the game appeared farther and farther out of reach for the Crimson.
Two more runs were scored in the top of the fourth when junior Kasey Lange threw errantly to first allowing two Dartmouth runners to score, including the batter.
Sophomore Gabrielle Ruiz replaced Halula to try and contain the damage. She managed to get out of the fourth with just one more run plated, but at this point it was 9-1 in favor of the Big Green.
In the fifth, a Dartmouth triple to right field brought home two more runs. Dartmouth scored two more in the top half of the inning and after the Crimson was unable to score again the mercy rule was enacted.
“Dartmouth is a great team,” Allard said. “They earned it today.”
DARTMOUTH 5, HARVARD 4
Things were looking good for the Crimson in the bottom of the sixth inning of the first game of the doubleheader. Freshman Zoe Galindo had just ripped a triple into the corner of Soldiers Field and Harvard held a 4-3 lead.
It was the little things, however, that eventually did the Crimson in. Senior Stephanie Regan tried to lay down a bunt to squeeze Galindo home, but was unable to get on top of the pitch from Dartmouth hurler Kaitlin McCalmon and instead popped up to the third baseman, unable to advance the runner. After junior captain Shelbi Olson grounded back to the pitcher, Galindo was left stranded.
When Morgan Groom stepped back into the circle in the top of the seventh, the Crimson were three outs away from forcing Dartmouth into an effective one game playoff for a spot in the championship game. After the first two Dartmouth batters reached base on groundball singles, Groom managed to force a double play, leaving a Dartmouth runner on second base with two outs.
The next Dartmouth batter laid down an artful bunt to third base, and beat the throw on a close-call where the tie went to the runner. Groom then allowed a hit up the middle, which tied the game, 4-4.
The Crimson were unable to score in the bottom of the seventh, leaving an intentionally walked Lange on base.
In the first at bat of extra innings, freshman Katie McEachern lifted a home run to left field for Dartmouth, which would end up being the game winning home run.
Groom pitched seven innings for the Crimson, giving up four earned runs on 14 hits and totaling four strikeouts. Ruiz was awarded the loss for giving up the game-winning run in the eighth.
Lange hit her thirteenth home run of the season, a solo shot, giving her sole position of the program’s all-time career home run record.
“I think we played our hearts out today, which is part of why it’s so hard [to lose],” Olson said. “Everybody gave 100% of what they had, and I can leave the field knowing we played our hearts out and that’s all we can do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After Christine Lin led the Harvard women’s golf team to the Ivy League title and a berth in the NCAA Regional Championships, the freshman earned The Crimson’s Athlete of the Week honors. With a big weekend of sports on the books, The Back Page looks at some other great performances:
Caleb Zimmick, Men’s Volleyball
The sophomore helped lead Harvard to its first-ever postseason win in a 3-2 victory over George Mason Thursday night. Zimmick recorded 13 kills and a team-high seven blocks and led the Crimson with a total of 19.5 points on the match. In Saturday’s loss to Penn State in the EIVA finals, Zimmick had six kills on seven attempts for a .714 hitting percentage.
Kasey Lange, Softball
On Thursday, the junior hit her 11th home run of the season to give her 28 on her career and tie her with Tiffany Whitton for most in program history.  Lange wasted no time in setting a new record, as she blasted two more homers over the weekend to give her 30.
Ian Audrey, Men’s Lacrosse
The freshman scored four goals in the Crimson’s 11-10 loss to Yale on Saturday. Harvard needed a win to earn a spot in the Ivy League playoffs, and Audrey stepped up to lead the Crimson offense in scoring. It was just Ardrey’s ninth appearance on the season. The freshman had only five goals on the season coming into the game, and his four goals doubled his previous career-high.
Harvard-Radcliffe Lightweight Crew
The Harvard-Radcliffe lightweights wore special blue and yellow shirts that said “Row for Boston” as the team competed on the Charles Saturday morning against MIT. Both the varsity eight and second varsity eight won by more than 10 seconds and finished their respective seasons undefeated.
Andy Nguyen, Men’s Tennis
The No. 21 Harvard men’s tennis team won its second straight Ivy League title and earned a berth to the NCAA tournament with its 6-1 win over Dartmouth on Saturday. Co-captain Andy Nguyen won at No. 3 singles, 6-3, 6-1, over Cameron Ghorbani. Nguyen, who is the only senior on the team, finished the season 12-2 at the No. 4 singles spot and 16-9 in doubles matches with his freshman partner Nicholas Mahlangu.

In this series, Flyby Staff Writer Olivia M. Munk identifies, dissects, and discusses ideas, articles, and opinions found in popular media and popular culture. She's here to inform you and to make you think—about what's out there, what it means to us, and what it might mean for you.
WHAT IT IS
Liberal arts colleges may be known for being accepting environments, but that doesn't mean they are places of uniform thought and opinion—not everyone holds the same views. Recently, over a dozen student protesters interrupted a performance for prospective students at Dartmouth College to decry instances of homophobia, sexual assault, and racism on campus, chanting "Dartmouth has a problem!" Following the protest, hateful comments and threats of physical violence pertaining to the protesters were posted on anonymous message board site Bored at Baker (and were promptly taken down). This past Wednesday, the college's administration cancelled classes to promote an open dialogue addressing the incidents.
 
 
WHY IT CAUGHT OUR ATTENTION
 
This isn't the first time this school year that a college has cancelled classes in hopes of fostering honest discussion about incidents of what some see as on-campus discrimination and prejudice. In March, Oberlin suspended classes after a string of unsettling occurrences culminated in a sighting of someone attired in what resembled Ku Klux Klan apparel. With student bodies as diverse as the ones at Oberlin and Dartmouth, conflicting views and feelings are bound to arise in the face of incidents such as sexual assault and racism.
 
Harvard has recently had its own share of conflict. In December, a flyer that appeared to be a parody of final clubs was distributed around the College. Much to the dismay of many students and administrators, the flyer included such inflammatory statements as "Jews need not apply" and "Coloreds OK."
In the wake of this event, Pforzheimer House Masters Nicholas A. Christakis and Erika L. Christakis '86 responded with a piece in Time Magazine in which they urged Harvard to reconsider its response to the incident, noting that perhaps the creators of the flyers were attempting to make a statement about final club culture at Harvard through their shocking statements.
"The protection of free speech is meaningless," they wrote, "if what we really mean is 'free speech we find appropriate.'"
 
Campuses such as Harvard, Oberlin, and Dartmouth are not the first places that come to mind when one thinks of intolerant environments. However, the events of the past year, years before—and most likely, years to come—cannot be ignored. Do college campuses today still foster environments in which intolerance, hatred, and discrimination are possible? Or are the strong responses to these events enough to indicate that we are on the path to eradicating these incidents as completely as will ever be possible? Further, is it possible that the responses thus far have been too strong, perhaps limiting free speech on campus to a troubling degree?
 
 
SO WHAT?
It's always disheartening to hear of instances of racial discrimination, sexual assault, homophobia, and generalized hatred. However, since these events do happen, how a college and its students address the problems becomes a crucial first step in the prevention of additional incidents. Sweeping tragic and shocking events under a rug, even if they are dealt with efficiently but quietly, rarely helps to prevent them from occurring in the future. As we have seen through the examples of Harvard, Oberlin, and now Dartmouth, it helps the process along when students, alumni, faculty, and administrators maintain a constant and healthy dialogue, among themselves and with the world at large.
 
This ongoing conversation seems to be alive and well at Harvard. If we take the example of discourse on sexual assault on our campus, it is clear that there are a number of active conversations going on all around us. Groups such as the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (OSAPR) are attempting to foster productive dialogue about sexual assault through events such as Take Back the Night. When many students, both male and female, expressed anger over the fact that Tyga, this year's Yardfest artist, uses misogynistic lyrics in his raps, my inbox filled with emails from OSAPR, inviting me to come "talk about Tyga." All Harvard freshmen participate in mandatory Community Conversations to open debates about race, religion, sexual assault, and sexual identity, and further conversations such as those run through Sustained Dialogue allow students to continue addressing these issues. The Harvard College Women's Center hosts bi-monthly meetings called "G-Chat," where students can discuss gender and sexuality over study break snacks.
 
When a very diverse group of people lives and works together, it is inevitable that there will be strong, differing opinions. It seems the best a college can do is to stress tolerance, acceptance, and dialogue. We are told that it's okay if you don't believe what someone else does—in fact, it's often better. All college students certainly have a right to make their opinions heard. The trouble comes when opinions turn into assault, hatred, and discrimination—then, as these campus-wide events demonstrate, it's time to do something about it. We can't expect all bad events to stop happening—but sparking honest debates and talks are most certainly a step in the right direction.
 
 
THE TAKEAWAY
 
With all that Harvard organizations—and organizations at colleges across America—do to foster discussions, is there more to be done? Probably. College campuses are unique ecosystems where people from all walks of life come together for four years. That differences in opinion abound does not have to mean that hatred does, too.

In a recent threat to garden parties everywhere, Missouri State Senator Ryan McKenna, a Democrat, proposed an amendment to his state's constitution that threatened destroy spring party season as we know it.
Citing the dubious assertion that "adults look ridiculous in seersucker suits," Esquire reported, McKenna said in a handwritten proposal, "Any person living in this state aged eight and under may wear seersucker suits at their leisure." For the grown folks, however? Not so much.
Apparently, the crinkly cotton controversy has heated up in light of certain Missouri state senators' propensities for the blue and white stripes.
 "I will not be bullied by the seersucker caucus," McKenna told The River Front Times, referring to the sartorial trend lighting up the Twittersphere and the Missouri State Capitol alike. "That's what this is about."
While McKenna eventually withdrew his proposed amendment to the bill, which was primarily focused on allocation of state funding to public colleges, Flyby advises members of the Harvard community to keep their guards up, since the Massachusetts state government is apt to take notice. We advise all concerned parties, members of the Porcellian, and those with upcoming Gilbert and Sullivan mixers, to stock up before the threat encroaches—because who would risk having to resort to linen?

Platter after platter of monkey bread seemed to materialize out of thin air and disappear in a matter of minutes at Leverett House's Masters' open house on Monday as Monkey Bread lovers crowded in for a last hurrah.
They will have to forgo the backdrop of oriental rugs, a grand piano, and picture-perfect views of Boston to eat their beloved delicacy for approximately the next six months.
While Old Leverett undergoes renovation as part of Harvard's House Renewal project, House Masters Howard Georgi '68 and Ann Georgi, fondly known as Chief and Coach, will be displaced from the well-loved Masters' residence. During construction, the two will reside in a DeWolfe suite.
Monkey Bread addicts should have no fear though—they can get their fix at open houses relocated to the Lev dining hall, which is set to reopen in time for the start of the fall semester.
Master Howard Georgi said he is vying to return to the confines of the Masters' suite as soon as possible. "We've let them know that we need to get back as soon as possible because the students need their monkey bread," he said.
If a whole summer still feels like an eternity to go without the familiar sticky sweetness, the recipe for monkey bread can be found on Lev’s website.
