After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Edward Elgar’s hymn “Great is the Lord” is a piece practically made for the organ, as it surges forward in great swells, slowly cascades through climbing chords, and demonstrates delicate melodic interplay.
Fittingly, the piece was the central work at Memorial Church’s Veterans Day service on Sunday, which marked the unveiling of Appleton Chapel’s new organ, installed last week.
Nicknamed “the Skinner,” The newly installed instrument is part of a two-organ solution to a musical quandary that has plagued Memorial Church since its construction in 1932. Apart from enhancing the church’s musical capacity, however, this organ’s placement also restores the original spatial layout of the church and chapel, in a long-awaited renovation.
The organ—a 1929 restoration originally constructed by renowned builder E.M. Skinner—is the smaller of two new instruments that will now provide the church’s music. The Skinner, offering a wider range of notes and a softer sound, will replace the sharply-defined, treble-heavy tones of its predecessor—an organ designed by C.B. Fisk, Inc. that towered in the church from 1967 until this past May.
“[The Skinner] has a lot of breadth of tone—surrounding tone rather than high tone—and that is more suitable to acting as a support for the choir,” Jones says. “Some of the music I have put down on the program [for morning services] was not particularly well suited to the [old Fisk organ], but I did it because it was good for the choir,” he adds. “Now I think we have the capability of doing all of this music exactly as it should be done.”
“The more sound that organ puts forth, the more sound we’re comfortable putting forth,” says Ian H. Clark ’12, Junior Secretary of the University Choir. “I could see at our rehearsal last Thursday, when we were singing with this massive organ, everybody was singing out a lot more.”
The Fisk organ was installed in 1967 because of an original organ’s inability to perform both tasks the church required—being too loud to accompany the intimate morning prayers in Appleton Chapel, yet never mustering the volume to fill Memorial Church for larger services.
But when Edward E. Jones came to Memorial Church in 2003 as Acting University Organist and Choirmaster, he saw the Fisk as having this same problem. Reverend Peter J. Gomes, a Divinity School professor, encouraged him to find a solution, and the church formed a committee.
“The idea of this church, and the idea of a rich musical church, is that you can do a lot of different things with an instrument, and [the Fisk organ] was not really serving that purpose,” says Jones, who is now the Gund University Organist and Choirmaster in Memorial Church and leads the University Choir. “[Gomes] has lived with this instrument the longest and was never its biggest fan, and had said to me that we need to think about this.”
Instead of making modifications to the iconic Fisk organ, Jones and Gomes arrived at the solution of removing it instead. They planned to then install two different organs in the church, each of which would serve a distinct musical purpose. Besides the Skinner, a larger organ—Fisk-commissioned, and currently being constructed—will be installed in the church’s rear gallery this summer. Scheduled to be unveiled on Easter Sunday of 2012, this new Fisk will accompany larger services.
“Two incredibly historic, important instruments had tried serving both rooms and had failed,” Jones says. “We decided that really the only way forward was having two different instruments.”
Jones and Gomes found the new Skinner in 2008 at a church that was closing in Hartford, Conn. It is an artifact in itself, as its creator is an icon in the organ-building world. According to Mike E. Foley, whose company, Foley-Baker Inc., installed the new organ, Skinner’s construction represents the height of American organ-building in the 1920s with its enveloping sound and romantic flow.
“Skinner was a very famous man in the organ world. If you were somebody, you had a Skinner,” Foley says. “This is a trend that’s happening around the country, to restore these old Skinners.”
This organ project, which costs approximately $6 million and will be funded by donors and church members, was inspired by more than just the desire to enhance the music of Memorial Church. The removal of the old Fisk organ also restores the original 1932 architecture of the church and Appleton Chapel, a change many have been awaiting since 1967.
When the church adopted the old Fisk, it vetoed installing the organ in the rear gallery. Instead, the instrument was placed against the back wall of the chapel. This move forced the lectern to the other side of the space, thereby isolating the chapel from the rest of the church. The organ also covered the east wall’s towering Palladian window.
“The symmetry of the chapel was lost, and there was no integration between the chapel and the church at all,” Jones says. “Many people, while they understood musically why this was done, felt that the chapel lost a lot of its integrity architecturally.”
Congregation member William R. Crout was a graduate school student in the 1960s, and he recalls the Palladian window and the original chapel.
“I regretted that the chapel was reconfigured to accommodate the new organ, and we lost the window which is so beautiful to behold inside the church,” Crout says. “It’s wonderful to have the window back.”
The organ renovation marks the beginning of projects that celebrate Gomes’s legacy, as the preacher will retire in June 2012. According to Jones and Lane, Gomes has always supported the church’s music program and had long hoped to return the church to its original layout.
“This is not a vanity project for Peter Gomes. It’s really about the church and the music of the church having the instruments to do what it can do best,” Jones says. “I think this is really an amazing end to his tenure here, to have put the church back to the way it was, and to make sure that we’re going forward—that the church is allowed to build and grow.”

Disney Revue
Nov. 18-20, 8 p.m. & Nov. 24, 10 p.m.
in the Adams House Pool Theater
Directed by Devon H. Dunn ’12
Music Directed by Alexander T. Valente ’12
Produced by Brenda Lin ’12
“‘Disney Revue’ brings to life everyone’s dream of having their lives played out as a Disney movie or a scene from ‘High School Musical,’” producer Brenda Lin ’12 says.
A spontaneous idea that arose from casual banter in the dining hall last May, “Disney Revue” is an original creation of Lin and director Devon H. Dunn ’12. The two, along with music director Alex T. Valente ’12, created a playlist of songs they wanted to include in the show before writing the script.
“‘Disney Revue’ is short, sweet, sassy, and full of Disney songs and puns. We wanted a witty, puny, and snarky script,” Lin says.
Despite the frivolous and informal nature of the play, Morgan E. Henry ’14, who plays Leading Lady, says that what she enjoyed the most about her experience was the ability to put her own personality into her role. “Though the show was not super-serious—it’s very casual—the process was very rewarding. ‘Disney Revue’ was written by us, and I got to shape my own character.”
Bringing together topics of hidden gender identities and illogical love, “Disney Revue” pieces together a bizarre plot of romance, treachery, and most importantly, Disney songs. Although the actors never directly reference the Disney movies, the production uses these classic songs to build upon the plot and portray the actors’ emotions and intentions, Lin says.
According to stage manager Lily R. Glimcher ’14, “Disney Revue” is aimed to excite the school for the Harvard-Yale football game. She says the entire production and rehearsal process lifted the spirits of the cast and hopes the audience will feel the same.
Henry agrees that the enthusiasm is contagious. “I really love musicals, I really love Disney, and now I get to be a princess,” she says. “Disney is a secret, dirty pleasure for everyone.”

This Friday marks fall term’s last full week of class, leaving little standing between students and winter break. The first Christmas lights have come out; the shops have stocked their shelves with peppermint bark and gingerbread men. The holidays storm in, and 2010 shuffles out. Just like that, another semester—and another year with it—comes to a close.
For some Harvard students, winter break too often means only another opportunity to take no break at all, to seek out an internship or otherwise augment their career prospects and cultural currency. For my part, I take breaks seriously—if you want to find me this January, my couch is a good place to start. But it’s not just the lounging I like; for me breaks are a chance to slow down and reflect.
Reflection is a tough word to pin down, but for me it means thinking about my life the same way I think about a story or a poem, sifting through scenes or stanzas to find threads of meaning. Breaks allow time for reading outside the syllabi, and these stories and poems themselves can represent and provoke the reflection that comes at the end of an epoch. Art about endings has helped me define my reflections on great lengths of time and isolate the moments that mattered.
Thomas Hardy’s “Darkling Thrush” is one such poem about an ending. Dated December 31, 1900, Hardy’s poem packs reflection on a century gone by and anticipation of a century to come into a few brief stanzas. It’s a winter poem, of course, with the speaker leaning on a gate “When Frost was spectre-gray.” It’s no happy ending, either: “every spirit upon earth / Seemed fervourless as I,” says the speaker as he looks out on the wintry dusk.
But the poem’s reflection on the century gone by doesn’t end with the speaker’s glum solitude; an old thrush breaks through the evening gloom, soaring through the winter cold “In full hearted evensong / Of joy illimited.” The bird comes as an unexpected sign of an incomprehensible joy, as a harbinger of “Some blessed Hope, whereof he knew / And I was unaware.” He flies with the force of grace.
That’s the force that should drive reflection. Some might warn of the threat of nostalgia, of doing a disservice to the past by imagining it as we wish it had been—and indeed wistfulness can be abused to help us avoid confronting the unsavory, particularly about ourselves. But the idea that emotional, time-restricted responses to events as they’re occurring is somehow preferable to later reflections on those events is flawed. Now is the present, and now is when we choose what to make of the past. Expecting to understand best what’s happening as it occurs is the same as expecting to understand a book best as when reading it for the first time.
Ernest Hemingway’s “The Old Man and the Sea” speaks to the force reflection on the past can bring to bear on the present. The novella tracks an old fisherman through a long, grueling trip in which he catches a huge marlin—the biggest catch of his life. On his way back to harbor he is forced to watch as sharks gradually pick all the meat from the fish’s bones. By the time he returns home he has nothing but his memories, nothing but his story.
Yet it is not the bleak story of the lost fish that the old man remembers when he lies down at the end of his voyage, finally home after fighting a long battle with an insuperable enemy. He remembers instead a scene he saw long ago when he was a boy, of lions playing on a long golden African beach: “He only dreamed of places now and of the lions on the beach. They played like young cats in the dusk and he loved them.” In his moments of rest the old man recovers what it was that really mattered to him: not the trips at sea, not the women of his past, not even the fish. It was a single scene, a singular perception of untamed beauty, that mattered.
We can’t force those moments, but we can be ready to receive them, not just to remember them fondly once they’ve passed but to greet them as they come. This winter break is a time to savor this year’s story before flipping forward to the next chapter. I won’t expect to understand it all but in the end, sometimes it takes turning the final page to realize what really mattered.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Richard Avedon, one of the greatest American photographers of the last century, once took an unforgettable portrait of Salman Rushdie. The author sat for Avedon in London on September 26, 1994, five short years after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran placed a fatwa on the author for his portrayal of Muhammad in “The Satanic Verses.” The subject sits centered in his frame, flush with the camera, staring directly into the lens. Under two thickly arched eyebrows his ever-drooping eyelids frame a gaze at once incredulous, subversive, and strangely hypnotic.
The portrait is hard to reconcile with the exuberant wit and wordplay exemplified by so much of Rushdie’s work. The author is, first and foremost, a playful yet captivating storyteller; his ever-imaginative magical realism has often led critics to trumpet his tales as diversions for all generations. Yet dark threads weave consistently through his writing, and his best novels—most notably the Booker Prize-winning “Midnight’s Children”—contain indirect yet sharp political and religious critiques.
“Luka and the Fire of Life,” Rushdie’s latest, is no exception. A late sequel to Rushdie’s 1990 “Haroun and the Sea of Stories,” the story follows the adventures of Haroun’s younger brother, Luka, on a magical quest to save his ailing father’s life. “Luka” is a treasure chest of glittering imagery and priceless puns; it is a sophisticated synthesis of mythology, elegantly transformed into a meditation on the power of the story. Yet the plot suffers from a number of seemingly arbitrary twists, and Rushdie’s employment of magical realism is less thoughtful than in his previous work.
In his everyday life, Luka’s hungry imagination—apparently inherited from his father Rashid, the great storyteller ridiculed as the “Shah of Blah” in “Haroun”—is fed by virtual reality. In cyber-communities he adopts inventive new identities, including an “Intergalactic Penguin named after a member of the Beatles,” and his addiction to a certain “MUU” console has his mother “‘in-console-able.’” When his father falls into a threateningly deep slumber, then, it comes as no surprise that Luka’s quest to steal the Fire of Life is couched as a video game complete with nine levels and 999 lives. He is guided along the River of Time of his own father’s stories by an anti-being representing Rashid, a “Nobodaddy” who gains solidity as the Shah of Blah’s life fades.
The conceit of the video game is timely, to be sure, and it allows Rushdie some comic license in constructing ridiculous character tests for Luka. At one point Luka manages to defeat a great army of angry rats with torrents of tortuous itching powder. At another, the protagonist finds himself pitted against Old Man River himself in a vicious riddling competition, a battle graced with some of Rushdie’s most groan-worthy puns. “What do you call a fish without an eye?” the Old Man rallies. “A fsh,” Luka retorts quickly.
At other times, the level-based framework of Luka’s video game quest becomes an excuse for the awkward disjunctions between absurd and unrelated plot twists. Luka finds himself facing troops of vultures and dragons at one moment, and watching gods of beauty mud-wrestle at the next. When confronted with insuperable obstacles—say, three “immense and impassable” rings of fire surrounding Luka’s quarry—at least one magical being in his party reveals a previously unknown talent or nugget of convenient wisdom to master the challenge. Caught in his own logical traps, Rushdie often takes refuge in the concepts of “P2C2Es” and “M2C2Ds” he created for “Haroun and the Sea of Stories”—respectively referring to Processes Too Complicated To Explain and Machines Too Complicated To Describe. They are moments of cheeky honesty, endearing concessions to the reader’s intelligence, but concessions nonetheless.
Given that this is a work of magical realism, Rushdie can be absolved of certain duties of credibility. However, the iterated anticlimaxes of Luka’s video-game challenges weaken the very excitement he hopes to create in his otherworldly visions. At its best, as in “Midnight’s Children,” Rushdie’s magical realism can transform a chaotic world with a touch of poetic teleology; in “Luka,” however, the author complacently indulges in a rather dissatisfying supernatural chaos.
This is not to say, though, that “Luka” lacks allegorical significance. On the contrary, Luka encounters a dystopian society run by easily offended rats who demand an unsupportable degree of tact and respect from all those who enter. The “Respectorate of I”—ostensibly a stand-in for Iran—is a colorless prison of a nation. Even these direct and dark allegories, however, are treated with a certain degree of levity and playfulness. Rushdie has little time to linger on his own personal battlefields when he creates for himself the task of uniting the myths of ages into one magical world—a world that features Norse gods fighting Roman deities, and Doc Brown of “Back to the Future” fame gallivanting through the River of Time alongside Mark Twain’s time-traveling Connecticut Yankee.
Rushdie’s immense synthetic project turns out, perhaps unsurprisingly, to be a musing on the longevity and legacy of stories themselves. In medias res, Luka’s quest to save his storytelling father’s life becomes a quest to save the stories themselves—which, after all, live only as long as the Shah of Blah can tell them. Luka’s wild romp through a colorful video game quest is a celebration of the creation of fiction itself. While their sum may be slightly disjointed, each absurd test of character Luka encounters along the way is a testament to the pure joy of invention.                                                                                                          —Staff writer Antonia M.R.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 2008 United States presidential campaign was legendary, marking not only the election of the first black President, but a moment where the American public was fully engaged in the development of a new era. To capture the changes and attitudes during this tumultuous period, London-based portrait artist Nicola Green followed President Barack H. Obama, who graduated from Harvard Law School in 1991, during his presidential campaign as the first-ever artist in residence. Her interpretation of the universal themes of this time period, visually translated into a series of images entitled “In Seven Days...”, is on display at the Law School in Austin Hall until December 3.
Creating her art from these campaign experiences, Green aims not to make a political statement but to convey what she calls “the larger human story.”
“It is about why this moment was important for present and future generations and what it could teach us. I wanted to remind people of what is possible when people come together and work together to make something happen... The 2008 campaign process was a tribute to the ideal of U.S. democracy, and I tried to give an artistic, visual sense of what it felt like to be at some of the events on the campaign,” she says.
Green says she chose to showcase her exhibit at the Law School for several reasons, not only because of the president’s affiliation. The project emerged from a friendship between Obama and Green’s husband, David L. Lammy, a member of Harvard Law School’s class of 1997, who serves as member of British Parliament. With the aid of Obama’s staff, she was able to access campaign events and observe the inner workings behind this influential campaign.
However, her main objective for choosing Harvard was to interact with the students who will become the country’s future leaders.
“I wanted this work to be launched in a public institution where young people in particular could engage with the work,” she says.
Green had originally planned one trip to create a single portrait of Obama; however, she  says she realized the need to expand her project to capture the changing attitudes in America during the elections.
“I quickly realized that I needed to make more than one trip and that the story I was witnessing was about the American people, the campaign and the global community more than it was about Obama,” she says.
The collection represents seven prevailing themes—also reflected in the works’ titles—she had observed on different days while accompanying Obama’s staff as artist in residence: “Light,” “Struggle,” “Hope,” “Change,” “Fear,” “Sacrifice/Embrace,” and “Peace.” The focus of the prints is seemingly simple and the themes easily understood. However, Green complicates a more general reading of her work.
For example, the last of the series, “Peace,” Green presents an orange image of a raised hand addressing an audience. Initially, the hand gestures a tranquil conclusion to the story; however, the same calm strength juxtaposed with the chaotic and unnerving orange background alludes to the need to preserve hope and unity.
Some of her pieces speak to more personal experiences. In “Struggle” Green illustrates a tight, upheld fist using 24 karat gold leaf. While the tension of the fist, as depicted by iron-colored lines of wrinkles and shadow, show Obama’s struggle and perseverance during the campaign, the image represents a more personal reflection of Obama and of her own experiences. The gold leaf acts as a representation of his—and of her own children’s—mixed ethnicity.
“I decided to use gold leaf because when my first dual heritage son was born, a black woman said to me, ‘When your little boy asks if he’s black or white you are to tell him that he’s golden,’” she says.
As in this project, Green aims to tell the stories of individuals through art, from personal narratives to greater social issues, which she then processes into simpler images that challenge her audiences to think about the ideas at hand.
“[The images] distill my literal experiences, as well as tell the story I saw unfold. For me this is a universal story about what hope actually means,” she says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a cliché story of childhood friendship: We were misfits. We were three girls who read too much, had awkward bodies, and liked to quote Monty Python. The two other girls had already been friends for four years when I joined the group—we would drink afternoon tea and giggle at episodes of “Monty Python’s Flying Circus,” delighted by innuendos that, in retrospect, we couldn’t have possibly fully understood.  With ups and downs, we were friends from the fourth grade through high school.
But what really brought us together was our passion for screwball comedies.  If Cary Grant starred in it, or even appeared, we loved it. I suggested that all of life’s questions were answered in “The Philadelphia Story” and “The Awful Truth”—and, for the most part, they agreed.
I don’t think it was an accident that we bonded over screwball comedies. These are films that Harvard philosophy professor emeritus, Stanley L. Cavell, calls “comedies of remarriage” in his book “Pursuits of Happiness.” They are movies that take a chaotic world, one that has in some way been turned on its head (usually by a grave misunderstanding between a couple that really ought to be together) and in reorder it through a remarriage. They are glossy films—products of Depression-Era America; they are both an escape from the economic problems of their time and a reminder that the people are flawed. During the course of these films two things usually happen: the obviously flawed people change (not entirely, but enough), and those around them learn to recognize their own flaws and forgive others’ shortcomings.
When we were twelve–years-olds huddled around television sets and sipping cocoa, we probably didn’t grasp the full significance of these lessons, but now they seem more salient. Because I admit it: I have sinned.  We all went to different colleges, promising to speak every week, and now I barely call them up once a month. Reaching out, calling back, and responding to e-mails has never been my strong suit. In my first year of college, I came to associate home with varying degrees of pain—my father was very ill when I returned for Christmas break and I was still stinging from a trying break-up with my high school boyfriend.
Sure, I still saw the other two girls but, we had changed; we were not the three little girls in plaid jumpers, reminding each other that “no one expects the Spanish Inquisition.” Over the holiday break, we still had tea but silences were palpable.  Old jokes fell flat, tea grew cold in our cups, and we left each others’ apartments, walking home alone into what seemed to me a desolate city.
We told each other we were excited to see each other, we couldn’t wait, but that summer I got an internship in Rome. I jumped at the opportunity not to be in New York, a place that was now filled with ghosts of a happier high school experience. When I returned from Italy we spent a weekend together by the sea; I was scolded for my poor romantic choices while abroad (in hindsight, they were right) and the distance between us, even as we sat on the beach reading The New Yorker, felt greater than ever.
In November of my sophomore year, I got on a bus with a group of other kids wearing crimson and journeyed to New Haven for Harvard-Yale, more to see one of the two friends than to watch the game. After a few hours of unsatisfying party-hopping, my friend had an idea; she suggested we watch “The Philadelphia Story,” our favorite of the screwball genre—a 1940 classic starring Katherine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and Jimmy Stewart. We purchased Tate’s Chocolate Chip Cookies and Milanos at a deli near her college and changed into our pajamas.  Sitting on her futon we watched the comedy of remarriage, and I fell asleep, my head on my friend’s shoulder, to the sounds of Dinah, the protagonist’s younger sister, singing “Lydia the Tatooed Lady.”
It did not feel like “old times” per se, but when I managed to find my way back to my friend’s room after the game, she and I decided to finish the movie before I went back to Cambridge. We sipped hot chocolate and watched Tracy Lord, the heroine played by Katherine Hepburn, learn not to be so proud.
I would like to write that I got better at keeping in touch after that moment—I didn’t.  Time has only made me worse. But I still maintain that “The Philadelphia Story” can answer all of life’s questions: “The time to make up your mind about people,” says Tracy Lord to a jaded journalist, “is never.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an article about Argentina’s bicentennial, n+1 founder and editor Benjamin Kunkel commented that in that country, “crisis has enforced creativity.” Holding up the nation’s artistic triumphs as a positive outcome of its tragic history is problematic, to say the least. And yet it’s hard to argue with the growing body of evidence for Kunkel’s claim, to which Juan José Saer’s most recently translated novel, “The Sixty-Five Years of Washington,” rendered in English by Steve Dolph, is a formidable addition. Despite frequent patches of unwieldiness, the book’s nuanced exploration of trauma, consciousness, and memory is nevertheless engaging; through Saer’s demanding style, a stark, elegiac beauty often shines.
“The Sixty-Five Years of Washington” follows two acquaintances, Angel Leto and the unnamed Mathematician, who stroll through the seaside town of Santa Fe on an October morning in 1961. Saer often digresses, detailing incidents in the two men’s lives before and after their walk together, but always returns to a birthday party that the two men missed over the weekend, held for the militant-turned-academic Washington Noriega.
It should be clear that Saer’s politics are not particularly subtle. Washington Noriega, whose name is a composite of two symbols of U.S. intervention in Latin America, is omnipotent and omnipresent but oddly passive throughout the novel. His influence casts a heavy layer of ennui that penetrates beyond the characters’ disappointment at having missed the party. If this sounds heavy-handed, it is. For some U.S. readers, the psychological complexity of Saer’s narrative might belie its simplistic politics—the characters live in fear of “the government,” carry suicide pills, and fawn over Noriega, whose ludicrous back story only makes sense as an allegory.
Saer is all too willing to include polemical non sequitur—as the men pass a church on their walk, he can’t resist adding “that some religions, as if the presence of a creator were not evident in the creation itself, need to make use, to demonstrate his existence, of some sign of his existence that’s separate from the objects he created.” This didacticism recalls Orwell and Huxley, and may seem outmoded to those accustomed to the political ambivalence of contemporary American fiction. It is only in the context of Argentina’s tragic twentieth century, which saw authoritarianism, torture, and assassinations continue well into the late 1970s, that Saer’s angry politics begin to make sense.
Saer is more successful in his rendering of Leto’s and the Mathematician’s interior states. Although the men are ostensibly in conversation with each other for the entire novel, each is preoccupied with his own thoughts, which Saer presents with painstaking attention to psychological consistency and detail. It is established early on that the Mathematician “swim[s] in the colorless river of premises, of propositions, of postulates,” but his emotional detachment and stubborn rationalism are only revealed gradually. When, at the end of the book, he earnestly tries to formulate an equation to describe his feeling of separation from his surroundings, the effect is dramatic but not overwhelming, because Saer has applied the Mathematician’s layers of alienation so carefully. Leto’s actions at the end of the novel are drastic in a different way, but Saer prepares the character just as carefully.
Yet the great strength of “The Sixty-Five Years of Washington” does not lie in its politics or its people. Rather, it can be found in Saer’s portrayal of the inadequacy of memory, and the flaws in human perception of reality. He is deeply interested in how memories are created and recalled, and is careful to record everything that lingers in the character’s minds as well as everything that they forget. Leto, the Mathematician, and their friends all construct false memories, and forget incidents that are true and important. Saer’s shimmering mirage of reality disorients and frustrates, always at the service of the larger tragedy of human fallibility.
Unfortunately, this style is inconsistently effective. Saer’s sentences wind on and on, doubling back, interjecting, correcting themselves. The effect is the same rewarding headache that Faulkner’s novels have been known to induce, but it should be noted that the rewards offered by “The Sixty-Five Years of Washington” are fewer and further between. Saer’s ramblings have none of the economy of Faulker’s prose. “They are going nowhere, in fact,” Saer observes of Leto and the Mathematician, “and unburdened, you could say, of duties or destination, they walk inside an integral, palpable actuality that spreads through them and that they likewise disperse, a delicate and transient organization of the physical—delimiting and containing, during an unforeseen lapse, the dismaying and destructive blind drift of things.” The narrator’s voice has the immediacy of any good stream of consciousness, but unpacking the layers of subordinate clauses does not yield much beyond a vague sense of erudition. These stylistic convolutions exist only for their own sake, and given Saer’s impressive intellect and moral conviction, he might have invested his florid prose with more political urgency.
Given its lofty historical and ontological concerns, it is easy to forget that “The Sixty-Five Years of Washington” is ultimately a travel narrative: a morning’s journey of 21 blocks. Saer punctuates his characters’ musings with descriptions of Santa Fe, and he fixates on a conception of “the city not as though it were divided into neighborhoods or sections, but rather into territories in the animal sense, an archaic and violent demarcation of ritual, bloody defense.” Yet Saer seems more interested in the social fragmentation of national trauma than in its geographical repercussions. In his Argentina, people are isolated from each other, and they are lucky if their experiences overlap enough to chat about Washington Noriega’s birthday last weekend. That may be the case, but it’s fortunate that this latest translation affords one last chance to glimpse Saer’s distorted and provocative inner world.

Sometime towards the end of this summer, Cee Lo Green dropped “Fuck You!” a superlative song whose gleeful video and exuberant bass breaks barged into a generation’s unconscious and now refuse to leave. Within two days of the karaoke-esque original viral video, otherwise dark college dorm-room parties were alight with the bright, white lyrical instruction “UH! WHHHHY? LADY?” (as precocious pre-teen partiers were shouting “forget you” rather than “fuck you” in their best Miley Cyrus) and echoing with slurred cries of “ain’t that some shit.” The song is inescapable, and yet few seem to tire of it. Its successful formula of rooting modern musical techniques in a foot-stomping core of soul is pervasive throughout Cee Lo’s fantastic LP “The Lady Killer.”
The album is based loosely around the concept of Cee Lo Green—previously best known as a member of Gnarls Barkley—in character as “The Lady Killer.” The first track, “The Lady Killer Theme (Intro)” starts with smoky, club-style piano improvisation, over which Cee Lo waxes seductive, setting the album’s tone: extremely imaginative, exciting and hilarious. The first time he speaks, it’s to say “Well hello there”—presumably to all the ladies—as the piano layers billowing jazz chords beneath his womanizing philosophy: “spontaneity is the spice of life, and I’ve indulged quite a bit.” It’s not hard to imagine him in a plush bathrobe, holding a glass of chardonnay in one hand and a cigar in the other, while several beautiful women dress sheepishly in the next room. The rest of the songs focus entertainingly on different aspects in the life of a lady killer, but the album’s concept is secondary to its unstoppable music.
“The Lady Killer” belongs to the same tradition as Janelle Monáe’s hit album, “The Archandroid.” Both are ostensibly of the neo-soul genre, but they derive inspiration from everywhere in pop culture. The synthesizers on Cee Lo’s “Bright Lights Bigger City” are redolent of Kanye West; the drum and bass part are cribbed straight from Michael Jackson, and the lyrics are taken from a classic 1970s disco jam. “The Lady Killer Theme” sounds essentially like the hero-heralding theme from Batman, with its cyclonic strings and spaghetti western guitar.
Cee Lo’s magpie tendency to create a unique style from multiple eclectic influences produces some of the best moments on the album. “It’s OK” begins with a poppy, indie-rock synth line before shifting to a classic soul verse, complete with a rock-solid drum and bass groove, punctuated by sharp jabs of guitar. On the chorus, however, Cee Lo weds these two styles beneath his joyful cries of affection, which are echoed by gospel back-up singers. Eventually, there are rolls of timpani, mournful trumpets and snatches of vibraphone. On paper, this instrumentation makes little sense, but on record it feels undeniably good. This one song packs enough sunshine into 3:46 to sustain any music lover through the winter.
The culmination of the album’s ethos is the warm soul stylings of “Old Fashioned.” The lyrics of this song function as a statement of intent for the whole album: “My love’s old fashioned / But it still works / Just the way it is,” and “Well it’s right on time / And it’s timeless / And it’ll be right here / For always” justify his indiscriminate mixing of classic soul techniques with more modern musical practices. In bringing together such disparate musical elements and rooting them in soul music, Cee Lo proves the relevance of classic musical forms with every upstroke of the guitar and whirl of the organ. In addition to serving as the conceptual core of the album, “Old Fashioned” features jaw-dropping vocal runs from Cee Lo, whose voice is not taken from any particular style, and is certainly timeless.
The last full song of “The Lady Killer” is a cover of Band of Horses’ “No One’s Gonna Love You,” on which Cee Lo turns the mopey, echoing guitars of the original into a clockwork soul groove. He translates the excitable, reverb-drenched vocals of Ben Bridwell into an all-out spectacle of soulful belting. Despite this liberal interpretation of the song, it’s still recognizably a Band of Horses composition. In demonstrating the ease with which a song like “No One’s Gonna Love You” can become a classic soul jam, Cee Lo drives home the message of “The Lady Killer:” music is never contained within its time period or its genre; there’s a little bit of soul music in every indie yelp, and a little bit of the Lady Killer in every one of us—even in the oddly-shaped, unbelievably talented figure of Cee Lo Green.

Paul Auster looked down as he read from his new novel “Sunset Park” in the crowded Brattle Theatre. The lamplight reflected off his glasses, almost as if it were a campfire and Auster were telling ghost stories. That intuition isn’t far off, though Auster’s tale is of more modern ghosts. He tells of abandoned buildings in the aftermath of the 2008 economic collapse as well as the haunted veterans returning from war.
Auster gave a reading and book signing sponsored by the Harvard Book Store at the Brattle this past Tuesday. “’Sunset Park’ takes place now—that is, from the fall of 2008 to the spring 0f 2009,” said Auster before beginning to read. Set in New York City, the book touches on themes of destitution, dispossession, and trauma as it follows the trials of a multitude of characters.
The most central of these is 28-year-old Miles Keller, a trash-out worker who obsessively photographs abandoned objects in the foreclosed homes which it is his job to clean out. “Perhaps, impulsive acts triggered by the rage of the dispossessed, disgusting but understandable statements of despair, but even if he is not always gripped by revulsion when he enters a house, he never opens a door without a feeling of dread,” Auster writes of Miles as he is confronted with the destruction done to a house since its desertion.
In jumping from section to section, Auster’s reading reflected the structure of the book itself, which is organized by narratives that switch from character to character.  What manages to unite these mostly young and disparate individuals is that “they’re all poor. All these people are struggling,” Auster explained. This is perhaps what drives these characters to come together as squatters in an apartment in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. One of the many characters trying to scrape by is Ellen, who, as Auster noted during his reading, “is trying to be an artist but not getting very far with it,” a comment that drew laughs from the crowd.
One might expect Auster, given the explicit timeframe of the book, to have strongly emphasized the war in Iraq. But in the excerpts Auster chose for this specific event at the Brattle, the commentary focused on veterans of wars more distant in history. Reading from one of the sections on the character Alice Bergstrom, Auster said, “When she thinks of that generation of silent men, the boys who lived through the Depression and grew up to become soldiers or not soldiers in the war, she doesn’t blame them for refusing to talk, for not wanting to go back into the past.” In the novel, Alice is writing her PhD on the 1946 film “The Best Years of Our Lives” about servicemen’s experiences returning to civilian life following the end of World War II. The disquiet of current generations is echoed through the trials of veterans of wars past.
Between the subjects of poverty and the effects war, Auster is seeking, in this latest book, to deliver a critique of contemporary America. His characters are struggling to find their own identity and personal meaning in an alienating world—a topic that recurs throughout Auster’s body of work. “Sunset Park” intersects thematically with his most famous series of novels “The New York Trilogy,” non-traditional detective stories which his new work reflects with its dimly noir sensibilities.
Cambridge was rather fortunate to host this event, since Auster rarely does readings except in New York City. In fact, this event was the only reading outside New York City he is giving for “Sunset Park,” as William Corbett, who introduced Auster, informed the crowd. Corbett is a longtime friend and literary colleague of Auster. “What has been going on in his writing has been percolating in our conversations for years,” said Corbett. According to him, the book that resulted from those discussions is compelling: “‘Sunset Park’ is a knock-out,” he said.

Fuzz rockers Weekend inhabit something of a musical wasteland. Their instrumentals borrow heavily from punk’s raw carelessness, yet their music is devoid of the angry punk spirit. It surges steadily forward like shoegaze, yet doesn’t embrace any gentle, hazy dreaminess. It lacks the dreamy pop sheen of M83, the terrifying imagination of A Place to Bury Strangers, the electronic quirks of Maps or School of Seven Bells. It is without hooks, without pleasure, without gimmick—but this unabashed absence is where it succeeds.
In a time when many shoegaze artists are working to expand the genre through layers of production and woozy synthesizers, Weekend’s debut LP “Sports” feels like a back-to-basics, anti-technology shoegaze revival in the vein of classic punk—while the album pushes through thick layers of sound, it remains starkly, surprisingly gritty in its crude instrumental palette.
This gritty restyling is—especially in contrast to many of their contemporaries—enough to make the rough-hewn album bitterly satisfying. But Weekend does more than just stubbornly defy modern styles—out of their reactionary sound also comes an inevitable tone of loss, helplessness, and dreary disaffection.
“Sports” isn’t a fun listen—what Weekend has created is a decidedly crude, flat, lo-fi styling of shoegaze dreaminess, drawing a flow of vague, contemplative tracks out of an abrasive, strikingly limited instrumental base. It’s simplistically produced, repetitive, lacking in harmony, and altogether not easy on the ears, but the album’s value is not in how harmonious it may be—rather, “Sports” proves harsh, but gratifying precisely in how stubbornly it defies a modern feel.
“Coma Summer” opens the album with a simple, hollow, 4/4 time drumbeat, rolling steadily into tuneless, distorted guitar scrapes pulsing along with the beat. This, and this alone, is the small, crude core of lo-fi instrumentals from which “Sports” takes its entire sound—jackhammer shivers of distorted guitar, thick bass notes, clattering garage-rock drums. These dirty, simple instruments tumble together, separate, rejoin and push forth in seemingly endless combinations, crafting a coarse vision around the relentless tempos that drive almost every track.
Despite the stripped-down instrumentation and lack of production (often emblematic of punk) the songs shuffle steadily with none of punk’s fire and catchiness. Rather, their fluid, meandering structures feel like closer kin to shoegaze and psychedelia. Shaun Durkan’s vocals edge nearer to the modern context—at times, he sings in the open, sweet wail reminiscent of Best Coast or Grizzly Bear; at others, the bratty groans of the Jesus and Mary Chain. The juxtaposition is fresh, and ultimately satisfying—it’s the unreal, pulsating flow of shoegaze, but wrapped in coarse, changeless grit.
The flat, relentless simplicity that drives this style would be a fatal flaw for most artists, but here it becomes Weekend’s greatest weapon in their bitterly refreshing repudiation of the electro-shoegaze artists of today. Weekend push forth in their dull, churning sound with such dogged consistency—even in solemner, freer-form tracks like “Monday Morning” and “Afterimage,” both of which seem synthesizer-ready—that it feels as if the band is pointedly, consciously pounding out its distance from modern electro-shoegaze as defiantly as it can. And it works—their back-to-basics monotony almost completely lacks vigor, yes, but it’s wholly gratifying in its stubborn standoffishness.
Yet their style also serves to push them beyond simple reactionary sentiment. It’s that gritty, constrained repetition that also helps consolidate their dreary artistic vision, a bleak and disaffected portrait whose creative integrity stands alone from the musical context of its era.
Durkan’s subject matter often swirls around the darker side of nostalgia—loss, wistfulness, helplessness, the indefatigable passage of time. Shaping the album’s sense of dreary endlessness, he’s taken with relentless, repeated wails that slowly drown in the instrumentals: “I don’t want to be alone” on “Monday Morning”; “I don’t want to go home” on “Monongah, WV”; “I’ll wait for you” on “Landscape.”
The rough-hewn style fleshes these themes out perfectly—in unwavering adherence to such a limited, scrappy instrumental range, Weekend have unraveled tracks that themselves feel constrained, repressed, beaten. The driving, ceaseless pulses in “Coma Summer,” “Monongah, WV,” “Age Class,” and most other tracks further lend the pieces a sense of heartless inevitability, with each song surging along into sudden inconclusive endings; together, “Sports” is a remarkably cohesive depiction of helplessness and constraint, even if—or especially since—it won’t make for an exciting listen.
With “Sports,” Weekend have defined their formula for artistic merit, pursuing with nonchalant ingenuity (or perhaps brilliant carelessness) the overlap of punk and shoegaze. Theirs is a vision based on withdrawal and absence, and simplicity is at the core of their own brand of integrity.

"For Colored Girls" is painful. Directed, written, and produced by Tyler Perry, the film is the equivalent of a two-hour emotional abuse session, and the funny moments are as painful as the rest—a woman slapping the cadaver of her rapist isn’t really all that funny—but they serve as the only release of tension in such an overly dramatic film. The original work, a series of poems collectively referred to as a choreopoem, by Ntozake Shange, titled "For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow is Enuf" does not shy away from the raw pain presented in Perry’s film adaptation, but there is hope, redemption, and an affirmation of the power of black womanhood and humanity in a larger sense by the end. In Perry’s hands, however, "For Colored Girls" is dragged down by screams, sobbing, stretching silences, and sweeping music that render an already heavy plot nearly unpalatable, leaving behind a bitter taste of destruction and defeat.
Shange’s choreopoem is the story of seven different women represented by seven different colors, each with her own story to tell. Though there is a jumbled sense of temporality in the original written work, in Perry’s film, all of their stories are happening at once (in the same apartment building, no less), and navigating their contrived relationships takes up at least the first 20 minutes of the film. Perry’s nods to each woman’s representative colors through clothing, objects, and even places of work are heavy-handed (Lady in Orange is named Tangie and Lady in Red runs "Robe Rouge" magazine) and may seem confusing to those who do not know the setup of the play.
Actually describing the plot of the film is like creating a catalogue of every woman’s worst nightmare. In two never-ending hours, domestic violence, rape, murder, childhood sexual abuse, back-alley abortion, HIV, and alcoholism are either graphically depicted or graphically discussed. Unfortunately, Perry is as ham-handed with these topics as he is with the women’s colors, resulting in many painfully long scenes of horrible events.
In one such scene, vibrant Lady in Yellow (Anika Noni Rose) is violently raped, the filming of which is incomprehensibly interspersed with shots of a digital clock and cuts to Lady in Red (Janet Jackson) at a shrilly sung opera, crying as her secretly gay husband checks out another man in the audience. In another, Lady in Purple (Tessa Thompson) sits on a table in a dark room waiting to get an illicit abortion. Perry’s choice to depict the scene from the poor girl’s point of view intimately includes the viewer in the terror that she feels as the camera zooms in on Macy Gray’s character rinsing fearsome silver tools in dirty liquor.
Most of the actresses do their best with Perry’s interpretation of Shange’s play, but they truly have their work cut out for them. Perry seems to use them for their crying skills and, by extension, their ability to endure lengthy and extreme close-ups of tearstained, tortured, and distorted faces, rather than their actual acting capabilities. This is especially true of Kimberly Elise as the Lady in Brown, who spends much of the film wailing and moaning due to an unspeakable crime committed by her character’s husband, despite the fact that she has the most room and arguably the most skill to deliver lines that could convey more than another shot of her sobbing face.
Loretta Devine as Lady in Green and Phylicia Rashad as the apartment manager do the best in their roles, imbuing their characters with wisdom and the warmth of human relatability occasionally missing in the other actresses. This is no accident; their characters are the sort that Perry is experienced with handling—multi-dimensional women with a sense of humor who have to make it in a rough world.
The script creates other acting difficulties; it switches back and forth between everyday dialogue and the rhyming, sing-songy soliloquies that characterize Shange’s work, making for awkward moments when "For Colored Girls" forgets that it’s a movie and not a play. Nowhere is this more evident than the fight scene between Lady in Orange (Thandie Newton) and Lady in White (Whoopi Goldberg), when both women sit in the same room, deliver parallel speeches that don’t quite seem to be addressed to each other, and then return to their previous argument. It is unclear whether these moments are supposed to be internal monologues or actual conversational exchanges, and they create even more confusion in a jumbled plot.
Tyler Perry tries to do too much in "For Colored Girls" and his writing and directorial choices turn Shange’s well-respected choreopoem into a melodramatic, painful piece on multiple levels. It’s an unfortunate truth that minority art in America, whether intentional or not, often ends up functioning as a representation of an entire minority group. "For Colored Girls" paints black women as strong but emotionally imbalanced victims of a resoundingly negative portrayal of black masculinity. "Being colored is a metaphysical dilemma I haven’t conquered yet," says Newton’s Tangie, in a modified version of one of the most powerful lines in the original play. Part of the reason that the film is so painful is because the depiction of blackness, even in a supposedly post-racial America, is still an unconquered dilemma, and Perry does it a disservice in "For Colored Girls."

"Romantic-mystery-thriller" is the vibe that director Alex Gibney confesses to aim for in "Client 9: The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer." But even if this genre-bending sounds like a tall order for a documentary, Gibney could not have chosen a better subject. After all, the scandal surrounding former New York governor Eliot Spitzer’s relationships with high-class prostitutes is wonderfully engaging.
Yet "Client 9" wants to be more than cinematic—it seemingly aspires to Greek tragedy. When he first appears in the film, Spitzer compares his own story to that of Icarus, claiming that both he and the mythrical figures were "taken down by hubris." He adds, arguably with a touch of remaining hubris, that stories like his "go back to Greek mythology." To be fair, "Client 9" is a sympathetic though not always flattering portrayal of Spitzer, but it does take the loftiness of his claims at face value. The documentary is wholly persuasive in its depiction of the enemies that brought down Spitzer as corrupt. However, the film ultimately fails to prove why this particular political sex scandal, out of the many that regularly stream out of the news cycle, deserves to be elevated.
The Wall Street suits that everyone has loved to hate since the economic downturn are cast as the bad guys in "Client 9." Gibney, the Academy Award-winning director of the documentaries "Taxi to the Dark Side" on the United States’ torture policy and "Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room," again cuts into the national politcal climate. According to "Client 9," Spitzer’s aggressive crackdowns as New York attorney general on unethical Wall Street practices—the same practices that would eventually lead to the financial collapse—earned him many powerful enemies on Wall Street.
Gibney gets an impressive roster of people to talk on camera, especially given that several of them make no secret of being Spitzer’s enemy. They include former New York Stock Exchange director Kenneth Langone and former CEO of AIG Maurice "Hank" Greenberg, both of whom came under investigation during Spitzer’s tenure as attorney general. The most colorful figure is surely Roger Stone, whom the documentary suggests was hired to go after Spitzer. A self-styled "GOP hitman," Stone proudly sports a Richard Nixon tattoo on his back. While no one admits to anything on camera, the editing juxtaposes conflicting statements to reveal that somebody must be lying.
Subtle details in "Client 9" function to align sympathies with Spitzer—for example, the way that interviewees are filmed can have a profound impact of the viewer’s reaction. Langone, the former Wall Street man, is filmed in a board room looming down at the camera. Skyscrapers, menacing in the background, are reflected in the cold mirror of the board room table. Spitzer, on the other hand, is filmed on a beige couch in what seems to be a living room—the domestic confines of a fallen crusader.
He is depicted as an idealistic reformer against the Wall Street morass and later, as New York governor, against the corruption in the state government. But a single man is no match for the establishment, and his zealousness may have backfired, the film suggests. "Client 9" reviews usual law enforcement practices against prostitution rings, which rarely target johns, to conclude that someone with money and connections was out searching for dirt on Spitzer.
While the corruption of Wall Street and of New York’s state government comprises the documentary’s primary focus, the story would of course be incomplete if it didn’t delve into the prostitution scandal. Ashley Dupre, the woman with Spitzer when he was caught, did not agree to appear in the film. The documentary dismisses her as someone who exaggerated her one-time relationship with Spitzer to cash in on fifteen minutes of fame. Instead, another escort, supposedly Spitzer’s favorite, is featured. However, because she does not wish to reveal her identity, the viewer must simply take the director’s word at face value. In fact, "Client 9" employs a few techniques more befitting fiction films, which may prompt a discerning audience member to question where exactly the line between truth and fiction lies. For example—without spoiling specific surprises—there are several instances where the film presents something in one way, only to reveal later that it is entirely something else.
"Client 9" is satisfyingly entertaining and informative, but it never makes good on the promise of Greek tragedy. The film is framed in such a way that it begins and ends with artists making high-minded proclamations about the nature of man as "half beast, half angel" and the downfall of Spitzer as an "ancient narrative." But it is hard to buy into the supposed epic scope of this particular story when a sequence in the film goes through a litany of similar political sex scandals—Mark Sanford, John Edwards, and Larry Craig to name just a few. Like its subject, "Client 9" is undone by its own ambitions.

The premise for “Unstoppable” doesn’t sound like a disaster movie—it sounds like a parody of a disaster movie. It involves an unmanned, runaway train hurtling along the tracks at high speeds... But wait! The train is filled with explosive chemicals! But wait! It’s headed right for another train full of schoolchildren! But wait! It might fly off the track into a group of explosive fuel tanks! It’s up to an inexperienced conductor and a rogue, veteran engineer to catch up to the train and get it under control.
Yet in spite of its utterly ridiculous story, “Unstoppable” is actually entertaining, with most of the credit going to its two immensely likeable stars—the established Denzel Washington and the up-and-coming Chris Pine—and its well-paced action sequences.
The film opens by introducing the audience to Will Colson (Pine), a fresh-faced conductor straight out of training, and Frank Barnes (Washington), an engineer and 28-year veteran of the rails. Though Washington and Pine manage to make their characters likable, their roles are also completely cliché. Pine plays the standard newbie who constantly makes mistakes, and Washington plays a character that can blandly be described as the standard “man with nothing left to lose.” Washington has his wise-cracking-mentor act on full display, and it is as likable as ever. Pine mostly plays the straight man throughout the film and the back-and-forth they exhibit is fun to watch. The two are supported by Connie Hooper (Rosario Dawson), a dispatcher who, in an unsurprising move, rebels against her superiors in order to save lives rather than profit margins.
But the skill of Washington and Pine cannot mask the implausible nature of much of the film. A careless rail yard worker accidentally puts a high-speed train in motion down the track. The train is headed towards a group of schoolchildren, and later, the highly populated town of Stanford, Pa., where it will most likely derail and level the town. Apparently, the film is “inspired by true events,” but that does not help make the events of “Unstoppable” more believable. The stilted dialogue certainly does not do the film any favors either. Describing the situation, Dawson asserts, “We’re not talking about a train here. We’re talking about a missile the size of the Chrysler building.” Kudos to Dawson for being able to recite the line with a straight face.
Director Tony Scott does manage to produce some impressive action, however. In one busy sequence, a helicopter attempts to lower a technician onto the speeding train while a second news helicopter films the action. And, of course, the film’s climax has Washington running over the tops of and jumping between train cars. Scott has a good eye for framing all of this action, with quick cuts, overhead shots, and pounding music all helping to sell the illusion. If one complaint could be leveled against the film’s visuals, it is that all of what is supposed to be the environment of rural Pennsylvania ends up looking the same. There are only so many ways to shoot a train speeding through the woods without the visuals becoming homogenous.
“Unstoppable” is an enjoyable popcorn movie, but its scripting and story constantly weigh it down. It survives, however, on the immense likability of its two leads and its exciting action. If audiences can ignore the train wreck of plot contrivances, they should be in for a fun ride.

The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s (HRDC) presentation of “The Balcony” by Jean Genet, which runs through November 20 on the Loeb Mainstage, is a thoughtful production of a rarely staged play.
Most of “The Balcony” takes place in a brothel where male clients play out their fantasies of holding powerful positions: a bishop forces a sinner to confess; a general rides his mare. In the brothel, scenes like these are thoroughly decorated and scripted, so that in acting the part, a client can make believe that he inhabits it. Take the Bishop, played by a confident Nasir W. Husain ’12. Left alone in the room after a session, he stares at the mirror. “The majesty, the dignity that light me up come from a more mysterious brilliance... I wish to be a bishop in solitude,” he says, still wearing his ornate garb. This desire for status lies at the play’s core. The clients in the brothel’s “studios” nominally come for the sex, but what they really fetishize is the chance to see someone else’s reflection.
A second type of power struggle rumbles outside the brothel’s walls: a dangerous rebellion is fermenting as the customers play inside, and it risks overwhelming the entire state unless the Chief of Police (Daniel J. Giles ’13) intervenes.
This rebellion intrudes on the brothel and gradually subsumes its clients. Its slow invasion of the guarded space is one of the production’s triumphs. Moments of sexual play-acting often intentionally pause abruptly as loud cries from outside penetrate the brittle walls of the set, designed by Elizabeth Y.Y. Mak ’12 and Snoweria Zhang ’12. When the “judge” (Anthony J. Sterle ’11) tries to orchestrate a scene with his “thief” (Vanessa B. Koo ’12) and the “executioner” (Ilker Oztop, a Harvard Medical School student) in one of the brothel’s rooms, he is continually interrupted by news of the infringing forces and the sounds of other clients. It’s a tribute to the trio’s strong acting that the atmosphere of the scene shifts from sexual tension to fear so fluidly.
Such ease remains constant throughout most of the play. Director Matthew C. Stone ’11—a Crimson arts writer—has a terrific sense of space, and his production uses the Mainstage to full effect. As the role of the rebellion grows, the set begins to fall apart. Lighting and occasional smoke enliven some of the longer scenes; these touches also help fill out the large stage. Timing and sound, frequent problems for student shows, were perfect—Stone’s “The Balcony” is an unusually polished production.
His only disappointing decision was to remove much of the original play’s text. In his director’s notes, Stone explains that he cut about a third of the original script in order to “ground” the show. In terms of the production’s difficulty, the choice makes sense. Genet’s writing is layered with poetic turns and philosophical flourish, and it is nice to have a chance to savor the luxury of these lines without being rushed. The more realistic production also does away with some of the more garish elements of the play—characters on risers and heavy make-up, for instance—that might have been unachievable in a college setting.
The pared-down script, though, creates its own confusion. The last 20 minutes of the performance felt frazzled compared to the leisurely pace of what preceded them. At times it’s unclear whether obscure references are the intention of the production or the fault of the viewer.
This was especially true with the relationship between the brothel’s owner, Irma (Maria-Ilinca Radulian ’11) and the Chief of Police. Radulian is a strong actress, and her low voice and poised self-assurance make her a good fit for the iron-willed matron. The relationship, though, never fully takes off. Hastily explained, it is usually relegated to a side role in the scenes featuring the pair. Both Irma and the Chief have their own wills to power, so it’s not hard to imagine that their relationship is just an accessory to their other aspirations. But when Radulian yells, “But I still love you!” to the withdrawn Chief, these strong feelings seem incongruous.
Stone’s desire to make “The Balcony” more accessible by removing some of its more fanciful elements is admirable, especially when he and the cast do a thorough job of realizing that vision. But the production may have benefited from more engagement with the text. Stone is such an able director, and his cast so invested in the play, that the reductionist move comes across a little self-deprecating. What’s the point of using such a rich play if you’re not going to sink your teeth into it?

On their fifth album “Disambiguation,” Underoath swings from hard, hardcore (“Illuminator”) to melodic rock (“Driftwood”). Underoath’s metalcore has become darker and heavier—lyrically and instrumentally—while maintaining the transient, tranquil breaks characteristic of the band. While the departure of the last founding member, drummer and melodic vocalist Aaron Gillespie, and the addition of Daniel Davison, the ex-drummer of Norma Jean, leaves the band even less like the original post-hardcore Underoath, but the new members have meshed well in “Disambiguation.”
Stylistic diversity—from metalcore to melodic rock—can be attributed to front man and vocalist Spencer Chamberlain’s range. “Disambiguation” finds Chamberlain having further developed his ability to bark out rumbling melodies. His growl has become more carnal and full-bodied, adding to the ominous atmosphere of Underoath’s album.
The album’s most hardcore tracks, such as “My Deteriorating Incline” and “Illuminator,” are driven by heavy, hyperactive guitar shredding, which harmonizes with dark bass lines. Breakdowns are plentiful, as low, rhythmic basses, dissonant guitar riffs, and accentuating toms synchronize to form full-bodied harmonies which reflect the band’s cohesion. Chamberlain’s clean vocals—singing long, sustained notes—contrast with the toms and pulsating bass keep the song racing.
“Vacant Mouth” is perhaps the track that most resembles the original essence of Underoath as the post-hardcore band, where dynamic and varied guitar riffs played alongside the rapid fire of toms to kindle an intensity which tantalizes ears and the mind. In breaks, light percussive elements and electronic manipulations create aural alcoves of peace. However, these pauses are employed unnecessarily frequently throughout the tracks and break the high energy of the album. Though its members have chemistry, the new line up is less skilful at achieving the balance between loud chaos and softer melodies. For example, in “In Division,” breakdowns occur almost every minute so that the song’s pace never reaches the aggressive, energetic climax.
Guitar instrumentation plays a less prominent role than in previous albums, mostly retreating to add discordance and harmony to the chaotic instrumental chorus rather than providing melodic contrast to Chamberlain’s growls. For example, on “In Division,” the guitar and bass repeat the same four-beat riff over the verses, become repetitive and uninteresting. However, in combination with Davison’s diverse drumming techniques and new experimentation in electronics, the instrumentation satisfies metalcore appetites. Underoath employs electronic manipulations to create hollow tones to their music as a way of creating calmness.
Chamberlain has reached a new, profoundly dark stage in his lyrics. The literary content of “Disambiguation” complements the instrumentation as it describes vengeance, struggle and revolution. In “Who Will Guard the Guardians,” Chamberlain passionately screams “Revolt / We stood by defeat for so long / We’ve been under your control / We will not be a part of your disease,” complementing the punches of power chords and the concluding rhythmic beat, analogous to a band of marching soldiers preparing to fight.
Gillespie’s departure, the last remaining founding member, initially stirred uncertainty among Underoath fans. Chamberlain sufficiently satisfies both vocal roles in this album, although Gillespie’s unique voice—which helped characterize Underoath—is missed. Davison fulfills drumming duties with a dynamic drive, fuelling the album’s energy. He adds his own style to drum pieces, rather than imitating Gillespie, which in quicker-tempos songs gives tracks a novel sound.
“Disambiguation” demonstrates the band’s skill and experience and another evolution in their musical genre. Possessing a wider range of style, the album has more mainstream appeal even in the context of their heavy lyrical content. For better or for worse, the new members have created music that little resembles the Underoath that hardcore fans remember from their early days.

November 5 marked the start of the Hindu festival of Diwali, the most important festival in the Hindu calendar. Diwali—which ended November 9—coincided with a generous offering of South Asian cultural events at Harvard, including performances of dance and music by students and professional artists alike. But even without a major festival to catalyze it, the South Asian artistic community is one of the most active and all-encompassing on campus.
South Asian art at Harvard enjoys a raised profile as a result of the sheer number of student groups devoted to its promotion and performance. Given the great regional variation between art forms of the Indian subcontinent, it is not surprising that there is such a wealth of groups on campus. What is perhaps more surprising is that each group manages to maintain its own identity while still collaborating on blockbuster shows like the annual “Ghungroo” performance. Nicolas J. Roth ’11, former cultural chair of the South Asian Association (SAA), said his role involved organizing a variety of events from Bollywood movie screenings to talks by contemporary South Asian authors.
One of the best-represented forms of South Asian art on campus is dance—both classical and fusion, or a blend of Eastern and Western styles. Janani A. Raveendran ’12 is heavily involved in South Asian dance at Harvard. She explains that South Asian Dance Company (SADC) does only fusion, while Harvard Deepam is a classical group that performs Bharatanatyam, a more classical form. Despite these distinctions, Raveendran says, “Each dance group has a dedicated show in which they really get a chance to shine.” For SADC, this comes with the annual fall show “Raunak,” which is Harvard’s only intercollegiate South Asian dance show. For Deepam, it was “Kalpanam, The Rebirth of Love,” a showcase of classical Indian dance that occurred November 6.
Of the South Asian students at Harvard who are classically trained in any of their culture’s art forms, Raveendran says, “The students with classical training are in the minority.” This explains the popularity of “Ghungroo,” SAA’s annual cultural show that typically takes place in March, in which students can perform with no prior training. Yet being of South Asian descent is not a prerequisite for participation either. Roth, for example, is not Indian. He says of ethnic organizations in general, “People often feel they are marked as outsiders.” But this has not been his experience with South Asian arts on campus. “There have been years in which there are more non-Indian than Indian performers in ‘Ghungroo,’” Roth says.
In addition to dance, students are committed to making the music of the Indian subcontinent more of a presence. Sangeet is a student organization devoted solely to South Asian classical music, which puts on concerts and invites famous musicians to perform. On November 6, Zakir Hussain, India’s foremost player of tabla—a North Indian percussion instrument—gave a concert in Sanders Theatre in aid of the Pakistan floods.
That same evening, classical dance groups came together to put on “Kalpanam,” a showcase of classical dance styles of India. The show included performances in Kathak, the best-known North Indian dance form, as well as Bharatanatyam, which is a widely practiced dance from southern India. Alongside these more familiar styles was a remarkable solo performance of the more obscure dance form of Kuchipudi, also from southern India, by Juhi Kuchroo ’13. Kuchroo finished the Kuchipudi piece in the traditional manner, masterfully executing complex footwork while balancing on a large shallow plate.
“Kalpanam” concluded with a performance by Deepam, who have performed at intercollegiate events and competitions. The fast paced and artfully choreographed “Thillana,” another traditional Bharatanatyam item, was a fitting end to the high energy and exuberant evening of dance.
There is an inherent paradox in the performance of all ethnic art forms. Ethnicity is what defines the art; yet to appreciate it, viewers must transcend ethnic boundaries. Students involved with South Asian art on campus work to ensure that the traditional or ethnic nature of the art does not alienate those from different backgrounds. When asked if friends from outside the South Asian community were supportive of his commitment to SAA, Roth says that sometimes, “They just feel awkward.” But judging from the warm applause from the decidedly mixed audience at “Kalpanam,” this feeling is easily eradicated.

“I promise you some generation next shit.” Kid Cudi drops this line as he opens his new album, “Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager,” and the rest of the album show Kid Cudi living up to this audacious promise. His first album, “Man on the Moon: The End of the Day,” explored the themes of dreams and imagination and was overall brighter and more upbeat, and fit the hip-hop niche very well. However, Cudi’s second album is much darker and ventures farther out from the typical parameters of hip hop. This album is raw at its core while maintaining complexity, infusing psychedelic, hip hop, and rock. “Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager” delves into Kid Cudi’s life without sugarcoating all the gritty details.
With this album, Kid Cudi edges further away from pure hip hop and inhabits a broader musical landscape. In “Erase Me,” Cudi is joined by his mentor, Kanye West. The track is a catchy fusion of hip hop and pop rock complete with an eighties vibe. Cudi also dabbles in indie rock with “Maniac”—as he did with collaborations with MGMT in his debut album—featuring Cage and St. Vincent. He even employs jazzier sounds in “Revofev,” whose swing rhythms and elegant balance between melody and rap combine creating a smooth, irresistible feel.
Kid Cudi’s exploration of different musical genres in “The Legend of Mr. Rager” parallels his admirable exploration of diverse themes throughout. Cudi illustrates and offers insight into several aspects of his life, most prominently about his problems with drug abuse. In “Wild’n Cuz I’m Young” he raps, “You live and you learn / Doin’ bumps in the day, keepin’ blunts to burn,” exposing his previous battles with cocaine use. There is a hollow, thumping beat that echoes in syncopation with a clapping sound effect. With eerie guitar distortions and synthesizers, the overall background music pairs well with Cudi’s rhymes.
“Mojo So Dope” even has Kid Cudi discussing his philosophy behind penning honest lyrics as a hip-hop artist. “You must understand when I speak about a song / It’s how I really am / Yeah this is how I really think / I really do rage my demons at the cage.” Cudi gives a refreshing perspective of a rapper discussing his craft—this introspection is a welcome change from many artists who rap about self-absorbed and superficial topics. Through this kind of lyrics Kid Cudi shows his willingness to be vulnerable in front of the public eye, as well as his growth as an artist. The combination of Cudi’s soothing rapping, haunting synth and humming organ progressions help round out the track.
On the bluntly titled song, “Marijuana,” an ethereal piano plays a simple, repetitive progression with soft, achingly haunting guitar riffs and a constant, pulsing beat. The song is a ballad for the drug—one of many confessions exploring Kid Cudi’s various vices—and captures a spooky, eerie atmosphere. Cudi nevertheless does not lose his sense of humor, ending the song at exactly 4:20.
Kid Cudi, who is already known for interesting collaborations with various artists, invites Cee Lo Green and Mary J. Blige to add their strong vocals to “Scott Mescudi Vs. The World” and “Don’t Play This Song” and “These Worries,” respectively. These collaborations with soulful singers add color to the rapper’s rather monotone vocals, making the album more versatile.
With “The Legend of Mr. Rager,” Kid Cudi succeeds in presenting a sophomore album that shows development and maturation. His honest attempt to capture the experience of using and abusing drugs, and the dark aspects of human relationships is complemented by his humorous asides and addictive beats. “Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager” is incredibly fluid in its complex fusion across musical influences and a worthy sequel to “Man on the Moon.”

“Fifteen years ago I sat where you sit now, and I thought exactly what you are now thinking. What’s going to happen to me? Will I find my place in the world? Am I really graduating a virgin?” said Conan C. O’Brien ’85 in his Class Day speech to the Harvard College graduates of 2000.
O’Brien’s prolific career in television has fired up the dreams of undergraduates searching for the answers to these very questions. During his college years, O’Brien wrote for the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, and was elected its president. After graduation, O’Brien found work as a writer for several top comedy shows, including “Saturday Night Live” and “The Simpsons.”
It seems that any student looking to go into television after graduation would kill for the kind of success O’Brien has found. To gain experience at Harvard, however, students must navigate a decentralized web of resources and opportunities. Interested students turn to a wide variety of extracurricular outlets to hone their production skills and network with alumni in the industry. Despite the lack of focused media studies classes for undergraduates, many professors encourage students to develop their skills within related courses. Ultimately, they advise, what matters most for success in the TV industry is a certain faithfulness to one’s own personal experiences and artistic vision.
TURN ON, TUNE IN, DON’T DROP OUT
When first coming to Harvard, many students do not have much familiarity with the production side of television beyond filming a few YouTube videos in high school.
It was not until he found himself involved with video production that Tyler G. Hall ’11 began to discover his interest. The extracurricular scene at Harvard boasts plenty of related outlets, particularly through Harvard Undergraduate Television (HUTV), the undergraduate online television network. HUTV’s website publishes student-produced sitcoms, talk shows, and sketch comedy programs, including the comedy news program On Harvard Time (OHT). “I did a little bit before I came in, but I started with ‘On Harvard Time’ just as their technical guy. I would do tech, and cameras, and lights and stuff, and I did that for most of the first semester,” he says. “I only started writing after that, but it ended up being a lot more fun.” Hall is now a writer, director, and producer for OHT.
For other students, finding television at Harvard is the discovery of an innovative and exciting outlet to write. Molly O. Fitzpatrick ’11, head writer and correspondent for OHT and a Crimson arts writer, cites the comedy-charged news delivery of “The Daily Show” and “The Colbert Report” as inspiration. “When I found out about ‘On Harvard Time,’ the idea that I could be involved with something that was an approximation of the TV shows I loved was extraordinarily exciting. I sort of didn’t think twice about it once I found out about it,” she says. “It was not a premeditated decision.”
HUTV serves as a hub for showcasing videos, like those filmed for OHT and the student soap opera “Ivory Tower,” to students, their families, and members of the industry. For those students in need of equipment, publicity, financing, and training, it also serves as a critical resource. HUTV President Tiffany N. Fereydouni ’11 stresses the opportunities for hands-on production provided by the network. Before HUTV, she says, “there were groups on campus for students interested in business, in law, etc., but there was no comparable umbrella organization supporting Harvard students interested in media and entertainment. And so the inaugural board founded HUTV to fufill that need.”
Recently, HUTV has also begun to work with Harvardwood, a nonprofit networking organization created in 1999 by several Harvard affiliates—including Adam J. Fratto ’90, producer of the ABC Family series “Greek”—to help students break into the entertainment industry. Harvardwood allows students to find contacts and professional resources in television and film to enhance their chances of success. One of the most hands-on Harvardwood programs is the annual January Term Harvardwood 101 trip to Los Angeles, which offers students the opportunity to visit studios and speak with professionals in order to explore a possible career in television.
ALL THE WORLD’S A SOUNDSTAGE
Students who participate in television-related extracurriculars also expand this experience with other creative outlets. Fitzpatrick, for instance, is the president of the improvisational comedy troupe On Thin Ice (OTI), which she claims offers valuable perspective on her own work. “It’s so great to be able to be around really funny people and make a jackass of yourself, in terms of just keeping your brain fresh for writing,” says Fitzpatrick.
Benjamin W. K. Smith ’12 also sees his writing for the Lampoon as valuable career-related experience. The Lampoon has long been known for the success of their alumni in the entertainment industry, who have gone on to write for “Seinfeld,” “The Office,” and “30 Rock,” among other successful comedy programs. “I did improv in high school, so it was something I always considered a hobby,” Smith says. “But doing it here, and hearing about alumni from organizations, and how they’ve gone on to continue to write, especially those from the Lampoon—it planted the idea in my head that it could be more than a hobby. I saw the clear connection.”
However, for Smith, it became more than simply just the story of others’ success. His work outside of undergraduate television and screenwriting classes at Harvard offers inspiration that may not be available elsewhere. “I didn’t really do any writing in high school, I really only started writing when I started comping the Lampoon,” Smith says. “Doing improv gives tons of great ideas, and writing gives you the ability to develop them more fully.” For Smith, writing for the Lampoon is one step on the way to writing for television. “I hope to do a written sketch show by the time I graduate,” he says.
ON THE WRITER’S BLOCK
Daniel J. Rubin, an instructor of dramatic screenwriting and an English professor, displays a small and unassuming poster for the film he wrote on the wall opposite his office door—1993’s “Groundhog Day.” Behind his desk hangs a much larger Marx Brothers poster, and across the room there are bookshelves stacked to the ceiling with books about film, writing, and sports.
Rubin underscores the importance of the need for practice to perfect the skill of screenwriting. Even without taking a class on screenwriting, learning how to write not only leads to creative thinking, but also simply to better storytelling. “To some extent I’m giving them tools and pointing out different ways people approach screenwriting, the process, the ideas, and how you articulate it… some of that’s useful. Some of it isn’t. I don’t care, I want them to be writing,” he says. “It’s really just writing experience. If they had the gumption to just sit down and just write, they’d get just as much out of it.”
For Rubin, the best screenwriting is accessible and meaningful to the writer and the audience. “You can leapfrog over a lot of student projects where there’s a lot of flash and maybe even a lot of great intellectual ideas, but ultimately the stories are terrible,” says Rubin. “They’re not anything we care about, and when I say we, I mean the writer himself doesn’t even care or know what it’s about.”
Similarly, Marcus Stern, Associate Director of the American Repertory Theatre (A.R.T.) at Harvard and the A.R.T. Institute for Advanced Theatre Training, has also taught screenwriting classes at Harvard in the past. He stresses the need for students to find a personal vision in the shadow of the monolithic image of the television industry. “Connecting life experiences to an artistic idea is a necessity to give it truth and relevance to both its creator and its audience,” Stern says. “In some way you have to have a personal connection to a story. If not, then you’re merely chasing the idea of the story. Without a personal connection to the material it’s nearly impossible to write or direct something that has true resonance for an audience.” To Stern, the journey of self-discovery in experience is what truly sets the best in the TV industry apart.
Yet, Rubin adds, students still have much to learn about the television industry and its collaborative structure. “If I recall how I thought about things when I was twenty, and hear the kind of questions I get from students when I’m speaking, I didn’t want people to mess with my vision and I saw anybody else’s creative input as being an imposition because I saw it the way I saw it and I wanted to make that happen,” says Rubin. “I’ve grown to appreciate the collaboration of very talented people, and it’s good for a person. It’s a little bit difficult for an artist to compromise, but it’s not really compromise. It’s bringing together different ideas to bring together the strongest script, the strongest characters, and the strongest scenes.”
DOWN TO “THE WIRE”
William J. Wilson, the a professor at the Kennedy School and the director of its Joblessness and Urban Poverty Research Program, does not usually have time for television. In fact, it was not until it had been running for several seasons and had been recommended to him that Wilson decided to sit down and watch “The Wire.” Today, he teaches the undergraduate course African and African American Studies 115: “HBO’s The Wire and its Contribution to Understanding Urban Inequality,” in which he uses the show as a context for dealing with social issues.
Like Rubin and Stern, Wilson emphasizes the need for personal experience when it comes to developing a vision for television. In particular, he notes how the knowledge of the show’s head writers, David Simon and Ed Burns, has shaped the production. “The reason that ‘The Wire’ does it so well is that David Simon and Burns worked well together. Burns used to be in the police department in Baltimore. David Simon was a former beat writer who focused on the Baltimore police for the Baltimore Sun.”
To Wilson, what sets the creators and those involved with such a critically acclaimed drama as “The Wire” apart from other shows are their constant efforts to stay informed about the relevant social issues. “I don’t think you can expect all producers and directors to be that sophisticated,” he says. “Not only did they draw on their own experiences, but I was thrilled to learn that my book, ‘When Work Disappears,’ published in 1996, was the inspiration for season two. Simon read social science literature and combined that with his own real-life experiences.”
“It’s really unlike anything else on TV,” says Elizabeth L. Greenspan, a current preceptor for Expository Writing who will teach the class this spring. She emphasizes that students hoping to go into a similar area of television should understand major societal issues, such as urban inequality, racism, and the drug economy. She encourages students “to take advantage of their time here to get as strong a foundation and understanding of these issues, even if it takes them a bit away from narrative, and the craft of writing.” This work may be tangential, but it is ultimately helpful, according to Greenspan. “Having that background can only make the story that you tell all the more provocative,” she says.
Wilson and Greenspan would urge students hoping to deal with real social issues in their television work to take a similar course of study. “I would think that for students who go into film writing and directing and who also took social science courses, I would hope they would put what they learn from social science courses into their storyline,” Wilson says.
Intimate knowledge of societal issues gives dramatic power to a script, and all aspects of the education Harvard students receive give them an edge in storytelling and thus in screenwriting. Undergraduates who are able to synthesize their own academic and artistic narratives will find themselves well prepared for the challenges of a television career.

Stephen Sondheim devotes a considerable portion of his new book, “Finishing the Hat,” to an argument about why he should not have written it in the first place. Theater lyrics, he argues, should be sung in their proper context, and not read on the page like poetry. A book such as “Hat” that primarily serves as a compilation of lyrics, then, should prove an inane exercise. In practice, however, Sondheim dismisses these misgivings.
“Finishing the Hat”—which will soon be joined by a second volume that covers Sondheim’s musicals after 1981—provides a fascinating and illuminating glimpse into the mind of modern musical theater’s greatest writer. While lyrics comprise the bulk of “Hat,” Sondheim offers a revealing gloss of these songs in addition to personal anecdotes about the development of his many shows. “Hat” is less a bible for the Sondheim aficionado than it is an insightful meditation on the process of creating art.
Listed in order of appearance in Sondheim’s life, a cast of characters—which serves as a veritable who’s who of influential theater artists of the twentieth century—opens the book. Starting “Hat” with this convention of theatrical writing illustrates a point to which Sondheim continually returns: the collaboration demanded in theater. He details the importance of writing with the staging in mind—a lesson he learns after director Jerome Robbins heatedly questions what Tony is supposed to do onstage during the song “Maria” in “West Side Story”—and his need for partners such as the librettist to feed his creative flow.
In the same vein, Sondheim frequently offers poignant reflections on what art can achieve on an individual level. “To be part of a collaboration is to be part of a family, and for me—the only child of constantly working and mostly absent parents, a kid who grew up without any sense of family—every new show provides me with one,” he writes. “It may be a temporary family, but it always gives me a solid sense of belonging to something outside of myself.”
This terse explanation of his home life forms the extent to which Sondheim delves into his own personal life; his focus is less the private influences that shaped his work and more the technical practice of his craft. Still, enough anecdotes about Sondheim and the artistic giants with whom he worked abound to satisfy curiosity about both the highs (Cole Porter jubilantly expressing delight over a rhyme in the song “Together, Wherever We Go” from “Gypsy”) and lows (clashing with composer Richard Rodgers while working on “Do I Hear a Waltz?”).
Throughout the lyrics—elegant and intricate pieces of writing which alone would merit their own book—Sondheim explains the nuances of rhyme and the necessity of character exploration, proving his points with direct examples from his work. He does not shy away from self-criticism, disparaging several ill-advised choices he now regrets and genially celebrating those decisions of which he is most proud. Through these mistakes and successes, Sondheim presents ground rules and sins of songwriting, as well as his three most crucial principles: content dictates form, less is more, and god is in the details.
Similarly, Sondheim is not afraid to criticize his peers—although he avoids writing about those who are still alive, for fear of hurting their feelings or stifling their work. The sidebars in which he explicates the work of others showcase Sondheim at his most playful and witty, and negatively demonstrate the standards for which he argues.
As Sondheim insists in the book, no one is spared from his critique—even his mentor and surrogate father Oscar Hammerstein II, which he vigorously proves in the sidebar concerning Hammerstein. “The flowery affectation of operetta lyrics [as taught by Hammerstein’s mentor Otto Harbach] was something Hammerstein subsequently could never entirely shake,” he writes. “That quality is what makes so much of his work feel old-fashioned and sugary today.”
He then goes on to criticize the diction of many of Hammerstein’s most beloved lyrics: for example, country bumpkin Nellie Forbush’s unnatural use of the word “bromidic” and the mention of an impossible “bright canary yellow” sky, both from the show “South Pacific.” Hammerstein’s infatuation with bird imagery particularly puzzles Sondheim. Of the lyric “A lark that is learning to pray” from “The Sound of Music,” he writes, “And while we’re at it, how can you tell a lark that is just learning to pray from one that’s actually praying? Wait a minute—a lark praying? What are we talking about?”
Such sensible and sharp observations pervade “Finishing the Hat.” However, Sondheim is generally careful not to explicitly denigrate such classic shows but instead use them as jumping-off points to teach his ideals.
In the introduction, Sondheim in fact explains that his reason for crafting the book rests in its instructive functions. He does not seek to present a work that appeals only to those in the know. Rather, Sondheim hopes that his observations prove valuable to anyone interested in the creative process. “Choices, decisions and mistakes in every attempt to make something that wasn’t there before are essentially the same, and exploring one set of them, I like to believe, may cast light on another,” he writes.
This broad view of the artistic experience saturates the book. “Finishing the Hat” borrows its title from a song in “Sunday in the Park with George,” Sondheim’s rumination on the power of art. “Look, I made a hat, where there never was a hat,” sings painter Georges Seurat as he begins to appreciate the compulsive satisfaction that stems from creation. Sondheim has effectively captured this elation—both on the stage and on the page.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An apparent lack of friendliness among students has led Columbia University to initiate a competition. “The Social Experiment” is meant to foster interaction and friendships among undergraduates, with a grand prize of $500 meant to encourage students to participate. Although efforts to increase social interaction on large campuses are welcome, Columbia’s new experiment is the wrong approach because it could easily generate competitiveness instead of amiability. It is doubtful that such a contest will actually benefit those students who truly need help interacting with their peers.
The contest, which is sponsored by Columbia’s Residential Programs and will run for one week, is designed so that students must speak to each other if they wish to win. Certain individuals will be designated as “password holders” and each day a prompt will appear on the Social Experiment’s website. Students must tell the prompt to a “password holder” in exchange for a password; undergraduates then return to the website and type in all the passwords they’ve accumulated. The top 10 collectors will earn prizes and the winner will receive a $500 reward.
Although competitions  can encourage people to work together, this particular approach is unlikely to foster any meaningful interactions. The proposed objective of the contest is to make friends, but some will likely choose to concentrate on winning the money instead. The competition creators run the risk that, rather than getting to know each other, students will focus solely on gathering passwords. With a hefty $500 prize in mind and multiple passwords to collect, students might limit any social interaction to the few words necessary to complete their objective.
The requisite prize money for The Social Experiment would be better spent on open, inter-dorm events, such as study breaks or ice cream socials. Students usually attend these low-key gatherings with the intention of meeting new people in a relaxed, friendly atmosphere. Students are likely to feel more confident when approaching their peers in laid-back events than in a high-pressure contest.
That said, we recognize that The Social Experiment is just a game, and we do not expect it to generate any truly negative repercussions. Furthermore, it is refreshing to see a college social initiative that does not depend solely on virtual interaction. In many popular online forums, like “Harvard FML” on our campus, students often post anonymous, negative comments instead of forging actual bonds with one another. Despite its flaws, Columbia’s social initiative is a welcome change from these prevalent Internet sites.
After freshman year it is easy for students to get stuck within their own social bubble, so we encourage both RAs and students at Columbia and other universities to test out different, innovative social experiments that do not simply revert to individual competition. One example is HarvardLunch, a recent initiative begun by a Harvard undergraduate that randomly pairs students up for platonic lunch dates.  However, such opportunities should always be voluntary—like both HarvardLunch and The Social Experiment—since students should never feel forced to participate in such events or activities. Top-down social initiatives have no place on a college campus, as they would only alienate certain students.
A major part of the college experience is about forging meaningful friendships. This can be difficult for students who have trouble meeting new people, and the problem is intensified on large, unenclosed urban campuses like Columbia’s. While we welcome Columbia’s effort to help alleviate social angst among its students, undergraduates are better off making new friends in friendlier atmospheres where they can engage in meaningful conversations without the thought of a large cash prize on their minds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Imagine that you’re sitting in Lamont Library, quietly studying. The student next to you shouts, “Hey Facebook, give me all the photos you have of that cute guy from section!” Someone in a blue Facebook jacket runs over and displays a big poster with embarrassing party photos. All around the library, students can be heard yelling at the top of their lungs about Facebook friends, Google searches, or the latest gossip. It sounds ridiculous, but this is how public our  interactions are when we use wireless networks. We’re ordinarily unaware of it because our laptops politely cover their ears when they hear private messages.
But what happens when someone decides to eavesdrop or—worse still—to actively pretend to be someone else? Firesheep is an extension to the Firefox browser that allows for exactly that. It exploits the fact that many prominent websites (including Facebook, Twitter, and Google search) don’t encrypt normal page requests. Once you’ve logged in, your browser sends a cookie to the server every time it connects so that the server knows who you are. If the connection is unencrypted, an eavesdropper can steal the cookie and pretend to be you; this is known as session hijacking.
This sort of attack is actually nothing new. The lack of encryption on popular websites has been a source of dismay in the network security community since 2004, if not earlier. Wireless networks make eavesdropping much easier to execute and much harder to detect. Unsecured networks like the Harvard wireless network are particularly vulnerable since any passers-by with a laptop can listen in. Financial institutions and others that place a premium on security have generally protected their websites with encryption, but most others lag in their efforts. Still, Google offered an option to always use HTTPS encryption in Gmail as early as 2008. This past January, Google changed the option to be opt-out rather than opt-in, a move that I hope others will follow.
What makes Firesheep different is the ease with which it can be used. There have been other tools such as Driftnet, which displays all images downloaded by people nearby, and Hamster, a program that makes session hijacking almost as easy as Firesheep does.  They all require at least some rudimentary knowledge. A large part of what makes Firesheep so alarming is seeing how quickly your roommate can learn to use it. This is precisely Eric Butler’s goal: to demonstrate to the general public how easy it is to eavesdrop on Internet conversations and to force companies to protect their websites against it.
Condemnation of Butler for releasing Firesheep is misplaced. There is a tradeoff between minimizing short-term exposure and encouraging websites to employ long-term solutions. This problem of responsible disclosure is hotly debated in the security field. Some argue that researchers like Butler should instead quietly tell companies about their vulnerabilities. This is sometimes disparagingly called “security by obscurity,” the idea that if no one knows about an issue no one can exploit it. The difficulty in the case of Firesheep is that the vulnerability was already well known among researchers and hobbyists. For companies like Facebook, the model was closer to “security by willful ignorance,” the idea that if you pretend an issue is unimportant, users won’t care. By and large, security problems in the Internet are not fixed unless they are well known, since there are so many people at so many companies who must be aware of them. No one will be convinced by a single programmer saying he made something unless people can try it out for themselves. For this reason, security researchers routinely provide sample exploits when they publish their findings.
What can we do about all this? The Crimson’s blog recently published a good list of precautions to take, starting with the all-important use of HTTPS wherever possible. Internet firms have a long history of ignoring security and privacy unless users demand it. Facebook and others do the public a disservice by not giving users the option to use HTTPS. This practice is lazy and irresponsible. It is not clear whether regulation would be of any use, either. Something akin to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which governs online medical records, could end up being an overly complicated and questionably effective mess of regulation that only protects against yesterday’s security problems. We can do better than this. The solution will come only when we demand a higher standard from the websites we use.

This eastern Mediterranean Jewish republic is the focal point of one of the most divisive conflicts of our time and is a source of strong emotions for many people. Although many may think of Israel as an exceptional country, I consider it as an ordinary country faced with extraordinary obstacles. Rather than focusing on the numerous obstacles facing it, I would like to focus on its normality, particularly on its ethnic and liberal democracy, economic structure, and cultural diversity.
Israel is not unlike many of the nation-states located in Europe. Although it is the only “Jewish State” in the world, in truth it functions much like any western European country. Like England, it flies its religious emblem on its flag; like Italy, its capital contains a global center of worship; and like France, its citizens are very likely to protest in the streets and express dissent. Each of these countries consists of an amalgamation of many different ethnicities, cultures, and religions; for example, the influx of North African and Turkish immigrants to Europe in the past half-century has added more diversity to European society. However, each of these states is proud to have its own core unique heritage, composed of elements of its own specific ethnicity, culture, and religion. Israel also functions under this “ethnic democracy” model, in which the state is proud to proclaim Judaism as its ethnic, religious, and cultural heritage—without limiting the religious freedom of minority populations. Israel’s heritage is unique among the nations, as any country’s heritage should be, yet the way it preserves its heritage is completely like a traditional European ethnic democracy does. And, as in European nations, this does not detract from Israel’s function as a liberal democracy.
The Israeli Declaration of Independence states that it “will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex; it will guarantee freedom of religion, conscience, language, education, and culture.” Israel is modeled after progressive liberal democracies and, just like any Western European democracy, functions just as messily. In Britain’s multi-party system, many thought it was strange that the Conservatives would form a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. In Israel, the current coalition is made up of six parties, ranging from religious to secular, hawks to doves, and liberals to conservatives. Factoring in the additional “two Jews, three opinions” rule, it is amazing how anything gets done over there.
Yet, somehow Israelis were able to get their economy in shape. Although it was considered a developing country until the late ’70s, Israel, a country the size of New Jersey with a smaller population than Chicago’s metropolitan area, has become an economic powerhouse in the world market, and has recently joined the prestigious Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. It ranks third worldwide (behind America and Canada) in the number of companies traded on Wall Street; second in the amount of venture capital funding received and amount of books published per capita; and first in the number of patents per capita, scientific journals per capita, and scientists per capita. Innovation and improvisation is prevalent in Israeli society (third-highest rate of entrepreneurship worldwide), allowing Israel to create some of the most advanced technology in the world. Aside from developing the first cell phone technology with Motorola, Israelis have also invented voicemail technology, AOL Instant Messenger, ingestible video cameras, and drip irrigation (which saved Israel from droughts). Israel managed to accomplish all this in 62 years, even though it was and still is boycotted by most Arab countries.
This economic innovation is only possible with a strong “melting-pot” of immigrants and a strong cultural ethos. Israel is the Jewish homeland, and has absorbed many millions of Jews from the Diaspora. There are Ethiopian Jews, Moroccan Jews, Chinese Jews, Russian Jews, French Jews, German Jews, Argentinean Jews, Mexican Jews, American Jews, and the list goes on. The cultural diversity, provided by experiences Jews have had all throughout the world, contributes to the ingenuity of the Israeli people. In addition, Israeli-Arab Muslims and Christians contribute fully to society and are equal members; many serve in the government, in the army, and in the private sector. This diversity creates a more open and tolerant society, a society that champions freedom of speech, press, religion, and enterprise.
Israel remains the only ethnic, liberal, capitalist, “melting-pot” democracy in the Middle East; the ongoing conflict shouldn’t cause the world to forget how extraordinarily ordinary Israel truly is.

Economists generally agree that one of the most crucial factors contributing to a nation’s long-term growth is its stock of human capital—the skills, capabilities, and potential of its citizens to create, innovate, and produce goods.  The Obama administration is known for an economic policy that has haltingly tried to revitalize the economy, but the administration’s most profound economic legacy will come in the area of long-term growth. Through a variety of efforts, the Obama administration has done a great deal to increase America’s stock of human capital, and there are many more relatively non-ideological efforts that should be implemented over the next two years to continue increasing our nation’s competitiveness.
For workers to be able to skillfully perform at their jobs and acquire knowledge and skills at a rapid rate, they must be in the proper physical conditions to do so. It is exceedingly difficult to reliably excel in the workplace or in the classroom when a lack of healthcare coverage means that one devastating sickness can bankrupt or sideline the entire family. A family is forced to choose between health and other necessary expenses, and either careers or education will surely suffer. The Affordable Care Act’s enormous expansion of coverage will do a great deal to solve this problem by ensuring that everyone has access to affordable coverage, increasing their physical health and allowing them to focus on improving their performance in school or at work.
Another major obstacle to acquiring knowledge or talent for many poorer Americans has been the enormous cost of college. Tuition increases have far outpaced inflation or the rise of income, and many low-income students who choose to go to college have had to take out onerous high-interest student loans to pay the bills. The Obama administration’s student loan reform act will “eliminate fees paid to private banks to act as intermediaries in providing loans to college students and use much of the nearly $68 billion in savings over 11 years to expand Pell grants and make it easier for students to repay outstanding loans after graduating.” The bill also invested a great deal in community colleges, making it one of the strongest laws to support opportunities for higher education in many decades.
These important steps have done a great deal to expand opportunity and improve our human capital, but there are many more non-ideological methods to investing in our nation’s future that should strongly be considered by the Republican Congress in the upcoming two years. Michelle Obama’s child nutrition bill is a small bill that could have a huge impact on the future of our nation’s poorest children by ensuring that they have the healthy food they need to sustain them throughout their day and help them learn and reach their potential. This small bill could go a long way to preparing our kids for the future at their most important developmental stage.
Similarly, education reform, a traditionally Republican policy idea, is another area where both parties could work together to expand opportunities and knowledge. The Obama administration has already made a considerable impact through its “Race to the Top” funds in the stimulus, which have incentivized states across the nation to reward teachers for their students’ performance. Legislation that improves teacher training, changes tenure and accountability methods, and allocates the funds to increase the length of the school day and school year can all continue to build the country’s knowledge base.
Finally, many of these efforts could be for naught if we allow the current economic slowdown to have permanent effects on our long-term growth. Long-term unemployment causes skills to be lost and makes it much harder to re-enter the labor force. The government must do everything it can, including new stimulus programs and incentives for companies to hire again, to make sure that the unemployed can get back to work as soon as possible. While building our nation’s future skill base, we must make sure that our current one doesn’t disappear.
Investing in human capital is important because though redistribution and social welfare policies can reduce immediate inequality, in the long run, only a substantial expansion of capabilities and opportunities will make America a more fair society. To get to Harvard, many of us have been well fed and educated, and we will likely be able to do the same for our children. But many Americans do not have the privilege of enjoying this virtuous cycle, which is why the Obama administration’s investment in the future of its citizens has been so meaningful. Long after current politicians leave office, their policies will have enabled America to strengthen its foundation of a healthier, stronger, and more educated population.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Adam B. Wheeler, the former student accused of fabricating his way into Harvard and defrauding the University of over $40,000, will likely plead guilty to at least some charges next month.
At his arraignment in May, Wheeler pleaded not guilty to 20 felony and misdemeanor counts. He spent several weeks in prison before posting $5,000 bail in June.
Wheeler’s attorney, Steven A. Sussman, said that he is negotiating a plea agreement with the prosecution, which would spare the government the time and expense of a trial in exchange for a lighter sentence.
The change of plea hearing, which Sussman requested last week, is scheduled for Dec. 16 at Middlesex Superior Court.
When asked whether Wheeler plans to change his plea to guilty at the upcoming hearing, Sussman told The Crimson: “That’s a reasonable assumption.”
Sussman said that Wheeler has not yet decided whether to plead guilty to all counts, which include larceny, identity fraud, falsifying an endorsement or approval, and pretending to hold a degree. However, Sussman said, “If he’s going to plead guilty [on any counts], I don’t think there’ll be a trial.”
Sussman said in May that if convicted on all counts, Wheeler could receive a statutory maximum of five years in prison.
Harvard Law School Professor Lloyd L. Weinreb said that Wheeler’s decision to change his plea is not unusual for a criminal case.
“It’s very, very common for someone to plead not guilty at the start and then change it as the trial draws closer,” Weinreb said. “The person and the person’s lawyer can conclude that this is the way he can get the best deal.... There’s enough sense that the sentence will be lighter.”
At the pre-trial hearing last week, Wheeler received permission to travel to his parents’ home in Delaware before his December court appearance. He had been forbidden to leave the state of Massachusetts since his arrest in the spring.
“I think the passage of time and his compliance with his conditions of release, et cetera, are all indications that he’s worthy of that permission,” Sussman said.
In his application to Harvard as a sophomore transfer student in 2007, Wheeler produced transcripts depicting perfect grades from Phillips Academy in Andover and freshman year at MIT, prosecutors allege.
In fact, Wheeler attended Caesar Rodney High School, a public school in Delaware, and spent two years at Bowdoin College in Maine before he was suspended for academic dishonesty. MIT does not award grades at all to first-year students.
In his junior year at Harvard, Wheeler, a resident of Kirkland House, won a Hoopes Prize for a paper that prosecutors now allege was plagiarized.
A committee judging his application to the Rhodes and Fulbright Scholarships in fall 2009 became suspicious of his academic integrity, leading to an investigation of his application to the College and later a criminal inquiry. Prosecutors found fake transcripts, false letters of recommendation, and fraudulent SAT scores.
Upon choosing to leave Harvard rather than face the Administrative Board in the fall of his senior year, Wheeler applied for transfer admission to Yale, Brown, Stanford, and the Maritime Studies Program of Williams College. He was accepted by Stanford and Williams before they learned of the criminal charges against him.
In the event that Wheeler decides not to change his plea, his trial is currently scheduled to begin on Feb. 7.

Harvard Law School Senior Fellow Dr. Lobsang Sangay may soon be adding a new title to his resume: Prime Minister of the Tibetan government in exile.
Last week, the scholar came in first place in the preliminary elections for the title of Kalon Tripa, or prime minister, topping the second-place finisher by nearly a 2-1 margin.
Should he prevail in the general election in March, he would become the government’s second prime minister since the Dalai Lama called for a directly-elected leader of the exiles in 2001.
The territory of Tibet is currently under the rule of China, which the government in exile considers an illegitimate military occupation.
The government in exile is headquartered in Dharamshala, India, where the Dalai Lama has been based since a failed uprising in 1959 against the People’s Republic of China [PRC].
Sangay described his decision to run for office as an “evolutionary process,” after his name came out on top of various straw polls and online conversations relating to the Tibetan elections.
In April, the National Democratic Party of Tibet formally asked him to run, and in June, Sangay visited India three times to conduct workshops in India, where he said his candidacy was well-received by people living in Tibetan settlements.
Sangay, who was born in Darjeeling, came to Harvard in 1995 as a Fulbright scholar obtaining his LLM in 1996 and JD from the Law School in 2004. He is the first individual of Tibetan origin to receive this distinction.
“Who I am now, as a scholar and an activist and a diplomat, is mainly because of Harvard,” Sangay said. “It seems that one of the main attractions of my candidacy is because of my Harvard credentials and credibility...It adds weight to my candidacy.”
Sangay said many of his colleagues encouraged his candidacy.
“He’s a very impressive person,” said William P. Alford, Director of East Asian Legal Studies at the Harvard Law School. “[He] has worked hard to foster dialogue with PRC officials and scholars.”
Sangay has described the primary responsibility of the Kalon Tripa as resolving the Chinese occupation, and gaining support from the international community and raising the profile of the Tibetan government around the world.
If elected, Sangay will leave Harvard for Dharamshala, where he will oversee an administration of seven ministries and approximately 1,400 bureaucrats.
“Public service is very important,” Sangay said.  “If you can make a difference in your own community and your country you can make this world a better place for your country and your generation.  I hope to make my small contribution towards that goal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly a quarter of the 176 eligible faculty members—a subset which includes some of the University’s oldest and most renowned professors—accepted a one-time retirement plan that will facilitate their departure within the next five years, the University announced yesterday.
The retirement programs, open to faculty members over the age of 65 with at least 10 years of experience at Harvard, will grant the University flexibility in its long-term planning in the aftermath of a trying fiscal period, according to Judith D. Singer, senior vice provost for faculty development and diversity.
Although the decisions are private, Reverend Peter J. Gomes, Professor of Middle East History E. Roger Owen, Neuroscience Professor John E. Dowling ‘57, and Classics Department Chair John M. Duffy have indicated to The Crimson that they planned to or have accepted the package.
Faculty members in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard Medical School, the Harvard School of Public Health, the Harvard Divinity School, and the Harvard Graduate School of Education were offered the package as of last December.
In FAS—the University’s largest school with 721 faculty members—32 professors opted into the program. The majority of participants chose the two longer-term options.
In the FAS package, eligible professors are presented with three options—a one, two, or four-year retirement plan that include part-time teaching duties and leave open the possibility of going on sabbatical.
The University has not offered a formal retirement plan since the 1994 repeal of a federal mandatory retirement law, which permitted Universities to force professors to retire at the age of 70.
Although the programs facilitate the retirement process, administrators said, they are not intended to incentivize faculty departures.
In an average year, around 10 faculty members enter the planning process for retirement, according to Singer. With the programs, 46 professors—averaging age 70—will retire over the course of the next five years, in addition to those professors who decide to retire in the meantime.
Singer said that there was no observable “pattern” across fields or departments.
Administrators emphasize that the plan was not a cost-cutting move but rather a measure of flexibility in the wake of the financial crisis.
Professors have often asked the administration for some form of retirement options, according to Singer.
Last year’s plan, with its July deadline, was a one-time pilot program. Professors can no longer participate in the particular programs offered last year.
But Singer said that FAS, the Divinity School, and the School of Public Health are in talks to create a permanent retirement-planning offering.
“The ability to plan a personalized and phased retirement has proven attractive to many of our faculty,” FAS Dean Michael D. Smith wrote in a letter to the Faculty yesterday, noting that FAS will announce a permanent plan in December.
“I thought it would be a marvelous opportunity,” said Dowling, who signed up for a four-year package 49 years after he first began teaching at Harvard. “It would be easing into retirement very nicely.”
Dowling, 75, said that the program matched with his personal retirement plans. “It came along at just the right time,” he said.

Beginning this week, the Harvard working group on LGBT issues will hold a series of open forums across campus designed to hear about the experiences and concerns of the College’s LGBT community.
The insights will help inform the working group’s report on the resource needs of LGBT students, which will be submitted in March to Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds.
Jia Hui Lee ’12, who will help lead Leverett House’s forum, said that “it is a positive move on the College’s part to make this process inclusive of student input.”
“The more students that come and the more experiences that each forum can collect means the possibility of getting better resources will be a lot higher,” Lee said.
The LGBT working group was formed this past October, shortly after a series of highly publicized suicides by LGBT students across the country.
Forums will be held at all twelve Houses and in the Yard, beginning with the first forum, at Adams House, on Wednesday.
The forums will be facilitated by students and House BGLTS tutors, and will be attended by at least one student and one faculty member of the working group.
“We want to make sure that all students, however they identify, feel welcome and come to share their perspectives so that whatever we recommend to the Dean will be in the service of the whole community,” said Susan B. Marine, who chairs the working group.
Participants’ words may be used in the working group’s proposal, but student names will be withheld, according to Marine, who is also the assistant dean of Harvard College for student life and the director of the Harvard College Women’s Center.
Marine said that the idea to hold house-based forums came from the process used in 2002 by the Committee to Address Sexual Assault at Harvard to explore students’ concerns about sexual violence.
Elizabeth C. Elrod ’11, who will help facilitate Pforzheimer House’s forum, said she hopes students with a breadth of experiences will attend the forums. Elrod said that for Harvard students, learning who to speak with about LGBT issues can be a challenge.
“Freshman year I was completely lost,” Elrod said. “People need to know where they can go to find support or just to talk. As it is now, it’s so hard to seek out the resources that you really need.”
Sam J. Bakkila ’11-’12, who will co-facilitate Eliot House’s forum, said that these discussions provide a space for people to voice their concerns and their needs.
“It’s really rare for the administration to solicit this type of feedback on a large scale throughout every house in the College, and we really have a receptive audience because the working group is actively looking for this kind of feedback,” Bakkila said.
He added that the conversations are open not only to LGBT students, but also to the broader community, including people who have friends who will be affected by the working group’s proposal.
To date, not all of the houses have scheduled their forums. Quincy House will host its forum on November 22; Pforzheimer House’s will take place on December 8.
While each house will hold a forum, students are welcome to attend discussions in any house.

A Harvard professor recently discovered two large bubble-shaped structures around the center of our galaxy, identifying a phenomenon that could facilitate scientists’ research into galaxy formation and black holes.
The discovery, made by Associate Professor of Astronomy and of Physics Douglas P. Finkbeiner and his team of Harvard researchers, was published in The Astrophysical Journal earlier this month.
The bubbles—each of which is approximately 30,000 light years long—extend perpendicular to the galaxy, one upward and one downward.
“They look to me almost like an infinity symbol tipped at 90 degrees, or like two teardrops,” said Finkbeiner.
The structures’ origin has not yet been determined. Finkbeiner said that the most likely explanation is that the bubbles were formed when matter that encountered the black hole in the center of the Milky Way was converted into a jet of energy.
Finkbeiner said another possible explanation­—one he is more skeptical of—is that the energy was released when a large number of stars exploded into supernovas around 7 million years ago.
The bubbles’ composition has not been determined, but Finkbeiner said he believes they are made of highly excited electrons, which emit gamma rays.
Finkbeiner—aloing with graduate assistants Meng Su and Tracy Slayter—discovered the structures by analyzing data from NASA’s Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope.
Researchers had previously detected evidence that may support presence of the bubbles both in our galaxy and beyond. But Finkbeiner’s discovery marks the first time such structures have been definitively.
Su said that the discovery might make it more difficult to find dark matter, the elusive substance that likely makes up 80 percent of the universe but remains undiscovered, because the black hole’s emissions would sweep away gamma rays that dark matter may also produce near the center of the galaxy.
Although dark matter emissions might otherwise have been identifiable, it appears that the bubble is pushing those emissions out of the galaxy, according to Su.
However, some scientists searching for dark matter are not discouraged by Finkbeiner’s discovery.
“If you want to look for gamma ray signals where the bubble happens to be, that might complicate things,” said Dan W. Hooper, an assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Chicago. “But if you want to look in the galactic center itself, I don’t think the bubbles are relevant...There still are places to look for dark matter that won’t be negatively impacted by the bubble.”
The discovery will be certain to spur further research at Harvard.
“At the center for astrophysics at Harvard, we have probably a couple hundred people who work on x-ray astronomy, and lot of what they do is study energetic outbursts of black holes in other galaxies,” Finkbeiner said. “It would be really neat for people who work on this kind of thing to have an example of some of those phenomena right in their face.”

Massachusetts regulators will soon restrict sales of caffeinated alcoholic beverages, including the popular Four Loko brand drinks.
WBZ-TV first reported the sale of malt beverages containing caffeine or other stimulants will be banned by the Massachusetts Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission, which had announced an inquiry into such drinks in an advisory last Friday.
The news comes after Harvard College administrators took a stand against the drink, with one calling it “badness in a can.”
In late October, University Health Services Director David S. Rosenthal ’59 and Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services Director Ryan M. Travia.
Travia cautioned students against consuming the drink, which they said has been linked to hospitalizations of students around the country due to its potent mix of caffeine and alcohol—as much as six beers in a single 23.5 ounce can.
“Drinking alcohol with energy drinks is dangerous, given the inherent risk in mixing alcohol, a depressant, with stimulants such as caffeine, ginseng,  guaran, and other additives,” the administrators wrote in the email.  “Often, stimulants mask the depressant effects of the alcohol, allowing the person to consume even more alcohol and thus, delaying feelings of drunkenness.”
Phusion Products, which manufactures Four Loko, has consistently defended the safety of its product and said it promotes safe drinking.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College accepted approximately 93 percent of undergraduate applications for on-campus housing during the second January Term, according to winter break coordinator Erin E. Goodman.
The 1,375 undergraduate students who applied for housing were notified of the college’s decisions yesterday. Approximately 1,275 requests were approved.
Last year 93.7 percent of J-Term housing applications were accepted.
College administrators say they limit the number of students allowed to stay on campus by the capacity of Annenberg Hall, which will remain the only dining facility open on campus before the College reopens on Jan. 16 for the Optional Winter Activities Week.
In contrast to last year, the notifications came a month after the deadline—a turnaround time more than twice as long as last year.
“Last year, decisions were made and notifications sent on a rolling basis,” Goodman wrote in an e-mail. “This year, we decided to work directly with coaches, departments, and resident deans, and to have a single notification date.”
Similar to last year’s J-Term, only students permitted to remain on campus will have card swipe access to College facilities. Unauthorized students living on campus could face disciplinary action by the Administrative Board.
Between Jan. 2 and Jan. 15, Annenberg will be open for lunch and dinner only, and gyms and libraries may also reduce their hours. Shuttles will follow a modified schedule from Jan. 3 to Jan. 15.
And as was the case last year, students will not be allowed to hold social gatherings or host guests in their dorm rooms, according to Goodman.
The College will re-open to all students a week before the beginning of the spring semester for the inaugural OWAW.
According to Goodman, the Undergraduate Council received over 50 grant applications to support OWAW events.
Registration for OWAW activities remains open until Dec. 3 and all official programming will be listed on the Harvard public events calendar.
Events will include a conference on healthy living and a multi-day workshop on creating smartphone applications. Additionally, UC president Johnny F. Bowman ’11 is planning a snowman-making event, according to Eric N. Hysen ’11, UC vice-president.
This year’s J-Term has been cast as an experiment to help determine how the period can be best used.
“This winter break is going to decide whether we expand [J-Term] in future years or whether we go back to a model of ‘School’s not in session, do what you want,’” Hysen said.

The sights, sounds and smells of Israel yesterday enticed Harvard students passing by the Science Center lawn into the Harvard Students for Israel’s (HSI) I-Fest.
The student group hosted its annual festival, a celebration and promotion of Israeli culture, attracting hungry students with plenty of Israeli food, music, and information. A diverse array of students were in attendance.
Booths around the edge of the marquee gave students opportunities to learn more about Israel.
As attendees milled about, a member of HSI chatted with students about opportunities to visit Israel during J-term, encouraging them to sign up for more information on the program.
HSI members also distributed “Did You Know?” cards, which contained trivia about Israel. One, picturing solar panels on a residential rooftop, said that Israel had “the highest number of solar-powered water heaters per capita.”
HSI president Daniel I. Brandt ’12 said that the goal of the event was to “raise awareness about Israel.”
Brandt noted that the central location of the Science Centre lawn was ideal, because it was visible and accessible to as many students as possible.
Harvard Students for Israel says its goal is to “advance the cause of Zionism and promote a peaceful and secure relationship between Israel and its neighbors.” The Israel festival is the group’s biggest event of the year.
“I’m so glad this finally came together,” said Hannah V. Gommerstadt ’13, one of the event organizers.
She added that the group ordered 2,500 falafel balls to feed all its anticipated visitors.
“We always have plenty of falafel,” said Brandt.
“There are a lot of great booths, a lot of variety”, said Eva N.B. Roben ’13, a volunteer at the event.
She noted that the event was going well and that the turnout had been good, adding “there’s a lot of falafel, and it’s never too early for falafel.”
The event ran from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., lunchtime for many Harvard students. The table in the center of the marquee, covered with paper plates, pita pockets, trays of hummus, falafel balls, and salad mix, was perpetually surrounded with visitors.
“Yummy­—looks delicious”, said attendee Camille Z. Coppola ’14.

Cambridge Rindge and Latin School celebrated the progress made on its renovation during a special session in the Cambridge City Council yesterday.
Joining the Council in the roundtable discussion were teachers, school administrators, alumni, and student parents of CRLS, who nodded and clapped as City Councilors took turns congratulating the progress in the school’s renovation.
Amongst other accomplishments, the renovation team has managed to construct new ceilings, buy new furniture and computers, and repaint the exterior of the buildings while keeping its expenditure within the 112 million dollar budget limit so far, according to Deputy City Manager Rich Rossi.
“As a community we are really proud of what’s going on at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School,” said Mayor David P. Maher. “Those kids [in CRLS] are truly excited about those buildings and the pride in those buildings is extraordinary.”
However, the renovation is still far from complete, Rossi said.
“Although we have finished on time, there are continuing [construction] issues to deal with,” said Rossi, who listed administrative offices and the cafeteria as buildings to renovate in the near future.
The rest of the renovations are scheduled to be completed by the end of this school year, according to a website CRLS specially built to highlight the renovation.
After the construction work is completely finished, the school will organize a celebration that stretches over 10 months, from September next year to June 2012, with events such as alumni guest lectures, dance exhibitions, and music exhibitions taking place every month.
The result of the merger of Rindge Technical School and Cambridge Latin high school in 1977, CRLS is a comprehensive high school with 1,586 students and 179 staff members, according to its website.
CRLS is located approximately half a mile east of Harvard Yard, on Broadway.

Governments should be flexible and creative in their treatment of sovereign debt, according to a Cornell Law School professor who spoke in Robinson Hall last night.
In front of an audience of students, faculty, and members of the public, Odette Lienau, an assistant professor of law at Cornell University, read from and led a discussion on her forthcoming paper, “Rethinking Sovereign Debt: Debt and Reputation in the Twentieth Century.”
In the paper, Lienau challenges “the general rule that sovereign states should repay debt even after a major regime change.” Citing such recent examples as Iraq and the Soviet Union, she argues that “sovereign debt continuity...is not as monolithic or natural as it first appears.”
“Should the new, black-African led South Africa really be expected to repay apartheid-era debt?” Lineau asks in the paper.
At the event, Lineau said that the questions in her paper constitute “living concepts that need to be studied in the contemporary moment.”
About 40 people attended the lecture, half of whom were students. After Lineau spoke, the floor was opened to the audience for comments and questions. Charles S. Maier, a professor of history at Harvard, and Kazi Sabeel Rahman, a graduate student in the Harvard Government Department, served as commentators and began the discussion.
Although the audience seemed to agree with Lineau’s general premise, they questioned the professor on the specifics of her paper.
The session was part of a continuing workshop on the “Political Economy of Modern Capitalism” offered to students in the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and Harvard Law School. Most of the sessions in the workshop are open to all.
“The idea of the seminar is to recognize that the political economy requires interdisciplinary work,” said Christine Desan, a professor at the Law School and one of the faculty chairs of the workshop.
The subject of Lienau’s paper fit the series because, according to Desan, it examines “sovereign debt as something that has legal doctrines and could be changed.”

Roughly 50 students and professors packed into a small room in CGIS yesterday evening to hear Jean C. Oi, a professor of Chinese politics at Stanford University, speak about the effects of new land distribution policies in rural China.
The talk—which was hosted by the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies—focused on newly emerging institutions in the Chinese countryside called shechu, which are created by dividing, merging, and re-organizing existing townships.
In the process of these reorganizations, Chinese peasants are losing their homes and ancestral land, and are being moved into apartments, often in distant villages.
In her talk, Oi said that the reasons behind the reorganizations were not completely clear, but the new policies are likely an attempt by local governments to generate revenue.
Oi explained that the creation of the shechu is a product of local governments  “hijack[ing] the vagueness” of policy pronouncements from the Chinese central government.
She quoted a top-level Chinese official who said, “The center cannot control the localities.”
Oi highlighted the fact that many of the newly-created villages are more crowded, and that the shechu committees which govern these merged villages are appointed, while earlier village officials had been elected.
But Oi also said that there are a few advantages to peasants in the development of the shechu. She noted that the apartments into which many peasants are relocated have running water and heat in the wintertime, an improvement on the conditions in some rural villages.
Some in the audience took a more positive outlook on the events in rural China.
Ying XiaoFei, a student at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, disagreed with Oi at the end of the talk, saying that peasants are voluntarily moving in many communities and are allowed to choose whether or not to give up their agricultural holdings.
Oi responded by saying, “Where I go, they tell me the same thing,” but she nonetheless maintained that there were “institutional problems with this procedure.”
Most of those attending the talk were graduate students and professors, and many could understand the speaker when she would crack an occasional joke in Chinese.
According to Professor Joseph Fewsmith of Boston University, who served as one of the coordinators of the event, some were interested in the talk because “China’s foreign policy has been much more assertive over the past year,” and “people are trying to figure out why.”
The seminars will continue in the next year.

CORRECTION: November 16, 2010

As his third year on the Harvard men’s soccer team was coming to a close last Saturday, junior Tim Linden could have gone quietly into the offseason with yet another solid performance out on the left wing.
Instead, when his team needed someone to step up and put the game away, Linden threaded his way into the attack to score the goal that would ultimately down No. 18 Penn in overtime.
“He was at the right place at the right time,” senior midfielder Alex Chi said. “He just never stops working. He is very good defensively, and he’s always dangerous on the left side. He was playing on the left, and he always has a knack for knowing where to be at the right time.”
In the 108th minute, freshman Connor McCarthy received a pass from junior Ben Tsuda that freed him up against a sole defender. The rookie noticed an open Linden streaking down the left and sent him a pass that the junior had no trouble putting away on the first touch, making the final score 2-1.
The game-winning goal not only gave the Crimson its first victory over a top-20 team since September, but it also marked the first goal of Linden’s collegiate career.
“I was actually surprised when I heard that he got his first goal because he has played an important part in so many of the goals we’ve scored,” sophomore forward Brian Rogers said. “I think it’s definitely well deserved, and it meant a lot to the team since it was the game-winning goal.”
It couldn’t have come at a better time, ending the men’s soccer season on a high note and putting a stop to a 15-game streak in which Harvard scored just one goal or fewer per game.
“[Linden’s goal] was a great way to end our season,” Chi said. “By our standards, it was a really bad season, but beating a team like Penn that’s highly ranked on a national scale, it showed that we did have the capability to play with the best teams in the nation.”
The offense finally woke up in the season finale, with Rogers first scoring in the 41st minute off a primary assist by Linden before he chipped in the game winner in the overtime period.
“He slipped the ball to me five yards outside of the 18-yard [penalty box] that I was just able to take down,” Rogers said. “He gave a good flick when I called for it and put me in a position that allowed me to score.”
The goal was especially satisfying since it came against the Quakers, a team that prevented the Crimson from winning the Ivy League title two years ago. The team had hoped that this final matchup would have done the same for Penn, but because of the Quakers’ loss to Princeton last week, Penn would remain out of contention unless Princeton lost its final match. Regardless, Harvard did its part to ensure that Penn did not win any share of this season’s Ivy title.
“I think it was a little bit of revenge for the guys,” Rogers said. “We were never really happy after one [goal], and hopefully the goal Tim scored will carry us through a productive offseason in which, like he was able to use last offseason, guys are able to step up and be contributors next year.”
For his efforts on both sides of the field, Linden was named the Ivy League Player of the Week.
Considered to be a rebuilding year after several key members of last year’s NCAA-qualifying team graduated, this season proved to be a difficult one for the Crimson.
But Linden’s leadership as a junior was invaluable for the young team, and his first career goal could foreshadow what should be an increased role for him on the team next year.
“Tim, being an upperclassmen now, he’s one of the guys that the underclassmen can talk to,” Chi said. “He’s always been very skilled on the ball when he’s on the field. His off-the-field mentality has improved a lot, and he’s definitely one of the future leaders of the team next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Esther Lofgren ’07-’09, success cannot be defined without first experiencing failure.
In 2007, the former All-American Radcliffe heavyweight rower took a year-long leave of absence, hoping to land a seat on the Olympics team in Beijing. But whereas Lofgren dominated her collegiate competition, the 6’3’’ rower found herself falling behind her peers.
“The training and competitiveness of the squad were much more rigorous than they’d been the other years I’d tried out for the team,” Lofgren wrote in an email to The Crimson. “It was very humbling to go from being considered reasonably fast in college, and even on the previous national teams, to seeing my name at the bottom of every results sheet. But I kept pushing myself, got fit, and didn’t give up. I ended up getting ‘called up’ when a couple of girls got injured late in the season.”
And though Lofgren did not claim a starting seat on the Olympic eight boat in Beijing, she came back to her Radcliffe team even more motivated to succeed.
“She really put a lot of effort into that run,” said former Radcliffe heavyweight captain Christine Baugh ’10. “It was difficult for her to be so close and fall slightly short, but she came back even more determined than ever. Not only did she improve herself, she came back to Harvard and Radcliffe to make our team better. She was so selfless, and she really brought everybody up and coached everybody to become better.”
As a member of the U.S. rowing team that won the gold medal in the eight at last week’s World Rowing Championships, Lofgren will now set her sights on the biggest prize in all of sports: Olympic gold.
FAST TIMES AT NEWPORT HARBOR HIGH
Even with parents who were both elite rowers, Lofgren’s first love was volleyball.
The former volleyball star attended Newport Harbor High in Newport Beach, Calif., a school well known for churning out volleyball talent such as April Ross and Misty May.
“Besides height, I didn’t really have any of the natural gifts that many of the other players did, although I had a ton of determination,” Lofgren wrote. “If I didn’t have the best vertical, I made up for it by practicing my serve for hours every afternoon.”
While some schools recruited Lofgren to play volleyball, her parents’ past eventually caught up with her, and Lofgren began to look more closely at rowing.
“The first day I went down to the boathouse with my best friend to try out the sport he’d just started and was so excited about, I was pretty much hooked from the beginning,” Lofgren wrote.
STEPPING STONES ON THE WATER
With rowing now the main priority, Lofgren joined the Radcliffe heavyweights as a rower with a unique blend of height, strength, rowing genes, and work ethic. Despite finishing sixth at the 2003 US Youth Rowing Invitational, Lofgren considered herself relatively unpolished.
“[Coach] Liz O’Leary [and] assistant coaches Cory Bosworth and Kate Woll helped me navigate the things I wanted to accomplish both with my studies and in the sport,” Lofgren wrote. “Although I’d learned to row in high school, I learned how to actually move a boat while at Radcliffe!”
With the guidance of O’Leary, Lofgren quickly blossomed into an elite rower on the Charles.
“Rowing is a sport where it just takes miles and miles of practice, you just have to put in your time and do the training,” O’Leary said. “She works hard in our workouts as a team, but she’ll come into the boathouse on a Sunday afternoon and sit in the erg by herself. She just has that look in her eyes that she wants to be successful.”
But even with the numerous accolades she picked up in college, including two appearances on the U.S. Under-23 National Team—Lofgren took home a gold medal in the eight at the 2006 World Rowing Championships—the rower also faced obstacles throughout her collegiate career that were often discouraging and frustrating.
Before her stint at the 2008 Olympics trial, Lofgren took the fall semester off in 2004.
To keep up with her rowing, she competed for a club team, only to find out that her participation, as dictated by NCAA rules, prevented her from competing for Radcliffe once she returned in the spring.
“For her, it was crushing,” O’Leary said. “You train all winter, but because of the rules, she couldn’t do it. But she still came to all the practices. When she couldn’t be in the boat, she was still there for the team. It was a pretty remarkable level of commitment, she kept training. Those are the kind of potholes to recover from.”
“She did have her failures, some rowing-wise, some not, but she was always willing to pick herself back up and come back hard again,” O’Leary added.
In true Esther Lofgren fashion, the rower responded to her setbacks, capping off her collegiate career with a silver medal at the 2009 Eastern Sprints.
“My most memorable experience rowing for Radcliffe was our race at Eastern Sprints,” Lofgren wrote. “We found our rhythm and the power in our legs and just went. That silver medal—a half-second behind Yale, a second ahead of Princeton—was so sweet to win, and I was so happy to be a part of such a fun and fast crew.”
As pair partners with Lofgren for most of her junior year, Baugh also cited the race as one to remember.
“It was one of the best races in my memory because I got to row next to Esther,” Baugh said. “She always had faith in me…and I definitely looked up to her.”
A TASTE OF GOLD
Upon graduation, Lofgren found herself out on the water pursuing a professional career in crew.
With a refined understanding of the sport from her Radcliffe rowing days, Lofgren has spent the last two years competing for the US Rowing team, earning a silver medal in the four at the 2009 World Rowing Championships and winning gold in the eight at the 2010 Rowing World Cup stop in Lucerne, Italy.
Last week, on Lake Karapiro in New Zealand, Lofgren earned her first gold medal in the eight at the World Rowing Championships.
Lofgren and her U.S. teammates pulled away from their competitors in the third 500 meters to earn the coveted gold in 6:12.42, 3.7 seconds ahead of runner-up Canada.
For Lofgren, becoming a world champion has been one of the defining moments of her young career so far.
“Winning gold at Lake Karapiro was an incredible, wonderful, amazing experience,” Lofgren wrote. “The race itself was exciting—we were able to keep executing our race plan, and kept moving on the field and building momentum as we raced towards the finish line. It was absolutely a team effort—we made a commitment to each other that at no point in the race were we going to be satisfied with where we were.”
“It makes me very proud of her accomplishments,” O’Leary said. “You always like to think that you play a part in helping her along the way, but in the end, it always boils down to all the work she put in over a long period of time.”
Though preparations for a 2012 Olympics run lie in the near future, last week’s achievement is just beginning to sink in.
“Waiting for the awards ceremony, I found myself in tears—it hadn’t hit home that we’d won, that all of my work over the last five years and especially my training since joining the squad in Princeton last October had resulted in earning a seat in the boat I’ve dreamed of rowing in,” Lofgren wrote in her blog. “We [had] achieved the goal we’d all set for ourselves. It was a powerful and emotional realization, and I was so happy to be able to share my joy with the women with whom I’d achieved these things.”
Rightfully so, the athlete who has worked the hardest has earned success competing at the highest level.
But as Esther Lofgren would say, it certainly didn’t come without some obstacles to overcome.

While reading period and final exams still remain a few weeks away, the Harvard sailing team faced its toughest test of the fall season this past weekend. After nearly two months of competitions, both the co-ed and women’s squads competed at their respective Atlantic Coast Championships this past weekend against the top collegiate sailing teams from up and down the East Coast.
The co-ed squad came away from its fall season-ending competition with a sixth place finish, while the women’s team placed 12th in its end-of-the-season regatta.
“It was obviously nice to qualify for and compete at the Atlantic Coast Championships this past weekend,” junior Alexandra Jumper said. “While we faced some challenging conditions, I think the women’s team had a productive weekend.”
ATLANTIC COAST DINGHY CHAMPIONSHIP, FISKE-HARRIMAN-SLEIGH
The co-ed team sent its best sailors down to Annapolis, Md., over the weekend to compete at the 2010 Atlantic Coast Dinghy Championship hosted by Navy. The championship regatta brought together the 18 best collegiate sailing teams, and the Crimson came away with a sixth-place team finish.
“For most of the regatta, [Harvard was] in the top four,” senior skipper John Stokes said. “But it was a tough weekend, as there was almost no wind, which made for light and shifty difficult conditions.”
Senior skipper Alan Palmer and senior crew Quincy Bock teamed up in the A division of racing and placed seventh, recording a score of 66 over the course of eight races in the two days of competition. The duo notched one race victory and finished just seven points out of fifth place.
“Many of the races this weekend were competed in marginal conditions, as there was barely enough wind in order to compete,” Stokes said. “This caused lots of frustration and made it difficult to sail consistently throughout the weekend.”
With Stokes skippering, senior Meghan Wareham provided the crew duties in the B division of racing, in which the Crimson pair matched their A-division counterparts in placing seventh. The duo earned two top-three finishes over the weekend and fell just eight points shy of third place in the division.
“[This 6th-place finish] does not dampen the rest of our strong performances this fall season,” Stokes said. “We competed against the top teams and showed that we have good boat speed and boat handling skills compared to the other schools.”
“Sixth place was also good enough for us to finish first in our conference rankings for the fall season, so while we would have liked to sail better, this sets us up well for the spring season, where I think we can take advantage of our depth and great coaching to compete well in team racing,” Stokes added.
WOMEN’S ATLANTIC COAST CHAMPIONSHIPS
The women’s squad traveled down to south Florida over the weekend to compete in the Women’s Atlantic Coast Championships hosted by Eckerd College. A pair of juniors and a pair of freshmen combined to bring home a 12th-place finish in an 18-team field.
“It was nice to compete in St. Petersburg and to sail in a warmer place than we are used to,” Jumper said.
Junior captain and skipper Emily Lambert teamed up with Jumper, who provided the crewing duties, to finish sixth in the A-division of racing. The junior duo finished in the top-five in five out of the 15 races over the two days of competition.
“Emily and I were happy with our finish in the A division,” Jumper said.
The freshmen pairing of skipper Morgan Russom and crew Caitlin Watson placed 16th in the B division, earning three top-six finishes.
“It has been great watching the freshmen come along as they learn a lot,” Jumper said. “They have been a great addition to the team, and I am excited to see what they can do come the spring season.”

With the plethora of varsity sports Harvard has to offer, it’s easy to overlook the equally wide array of its club programs. The Radcliffe club rugby team, however, is letting its record speak for itself and quickly gaining distinction for its success. The team posted a 6-1 regular season record, good enough to qualify them for postseason competition.
“The season has been amazing,” senior Anna Kamerow said. “We only lost one time going into playoffs, so we came into it with a lot of great energy.”
The Black and White cruised through the NERFU tournament, losing only to Norwich—a team consistently ranked as the number one team in national rankings—and taking down Boston University, 46-24. Radcliffe secured a spot at Nationals in the spring over the weekend at the Northeast Rugby Union (NRU) tournament, beating SUNY Cortland and Boston University again along the way.
With its postseason success and upcoming Nationals in April, the Black and White is trying to prepare for the road ahead and enjoy its moment of great success.
“Overall as a team, we’re just excited,” Kamerow said. “It was our main goal to qualify and now that we have, we want to get as strong and as good as possible before Nationals so we can take this challenge as far as possible.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the modern era of sports, being a college coach carries with it the burden of constant media attention. Facing dozens of reporters at press conferences, head coaches have gotten savvier—they say what they need to and leave the rest up for speculation. Here at The Back Page, we’re happy to decode some of these media sessions, showing the average fan what we think coaches’ answers “really” mean.
 
Harvard coach Tim Murphy was in an unenviable position on Saturday afternoon. In his team’s biggest game of the season, the Crimson simply got outplayed. Penn won at least a share of an Ivy title on Franklin Field, and Murphy knew his team was out of the running for its sixth crown under his leadership. He took an accordingly somber tone at the postgame press conference, giving due credit to Penn and accepting responsibility for the Crimson’s shortcomings. We take a look at what Murphy’s comments say about Harvard heading into the Yale game this weekend in this week’s edition of Sound Off.
What Murphy Said: Penn’s a tremendous football team, and they’re a team that, you know, watching film on them from the first game right through today, has gotten better and better every week. And today, they were completely in sync, special teams, defensively, and offensively. It made us look bad, no question about it. I didn’t feel like we played great. Needless to say, some of that certainly is due to an outstanding Penn team, and some of that is that we just didn’t make any plays.
What Murphy Meant: This is a very accurate and honest assessment of Saturday’s game. The Quakers were dominant, and to a certain extent, Harvard didn’t stand a chance because it couldn’t match up with Penn’s powerful and well-conditioned team for a full 60 minutes. But the Crimson was right in the game through halftime, and it was mistakes and silly penalties—including back-to-back illegal motion and illegal formation penalties that killed a promising drive in the first quarter—that kept Harvard from taking advantage of its early opportunities.
What Murphy Said: There were some really tough special teams plays. Obviously, the first one, in which we stop them, and then we touch the ball, and they get the ball down deep, [giving them] first and 10, that one is a freak play. All I know is it looked like we were going to get the ball at the 20, and then it looks like maybe we’re going to get a touchdown, then maybe we’re going to get a safety, and then all of a sudden it’s at the 50-yard line. Huge field position swings.
What Murphy Meant: Murphy is referring to an early second-quarter play, in which Harvard stopped Penn at midfield, forcing the Quakers to punt. The punt hit junior Dan Minamide, making it a live ball, and Penn recovered the fumble at the Crimson nine-yard line. Although the Harvard defense did make a big stop, holding the Quakers to just a field goal, this play was a game-changer in that it got Penn on the board and swung momentum squarely to the Quakers’ side—a surge of momentum they never relinquished. The Crimson outgained Penn and had twice as many first downs, but because the Quakers won the field-position battle and had superior special teams, the game became incredibly lopsided.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Saturday, the Princeton women’s hockey had home-court advantage and a goalie who made 30 saves. Harvard had senior Katharine Chute. The Minnesota native, named “Ms. Hockey” in high school, scored both goals for the Crimson in a 2-2 tie. Playing in her final year for Harvard, Chute hopes that this is only the beginning of a great season for her and her team. In this exclusive interview, Chute looks back on her time in crimson, from embarrassing moments to dancing parents to touchy subjects. Every week, the Full-Court Press gives you the sort of personal scoop that you’re not likely to hear at a typical press conference.
Name: Katharine Chute
Year: 2011
Stats: A two-time ECAC Hockey All-Academic team pick, Chute finished her freshman year with a +15 ranking, scoring the game-winning goal against Clarkson in the ECAC semifinals. Chute was also prolific the two previous seasons, playing in all 65 matchups and scoring five goals each year.
Question time!
1.Typical pre-game meal.
When we're at home, I have toast with peanut butter and banana, rice with pasta sauce and cheese, chicken or fish, some veggies or salad, and lots of water. I used to say I don't have a routine, but apparently I do!
2. List four songs you listen to before games to get pumped up.
I actually don't listen to much music because it distracts me, so it's a short list. I like Wavin' Flag by K'naan and Remember the Name by Fort Minor. Plus, we have a few team pump-up songs, but I won't divulge those here.
3. Favorite team to play against and why?
I love to play Minnesota because it's my home state and it's always a hard-fought battle. I love the Midwestern style of play with an emphasis on speed, physicality, and play-making.
4. Most ridiculous thing that has taken place in your team's locker room.
Let's just say we've had some pretty outrageous psych ups. And also, every spring there is a figure skating show at our rink and they walk through our locker room to get to the ice. It's always a touchy subject.
5. Most embarrassing moment you've had on the ice.
My freshman or sophomore year, I was starting in one of our Beanpot games, and there was a pretty good crowd. Normally during announcements, we skate through the team along the goal line and then turn up ice and stop on the blue line. Well, it all started out fine, until I realized I was going way too fast heading into the turn...by that point there wasn't much I could do, and I lost an edge and hit the boards with a bang. Everyone was watching. I honestly just laughed at myself! Classic mistake. It must've pumped me up, though, because I remember I played a great game afterwards!
6. Animal that best represents your style of play and why.
I'm not really sure. My teammates described me as a hare one time, but that may have been more of a personal judgment...
7. Most ridiculous thing you have heard a fan yell at a game you were playing in.
Hmm...I can't normally hear individual comments, but oftentimes I catch some of our parents dancing to the music. Sometimes they're good enough to make it on the Jumbotron.
8. If you could play for another sports team at Harvard, which would it be and why?
I'd have to say Cross Country and Track and Field, since [those are the sports] my roommates [participate in]! It'd be quite the change though!
9. Position you would play in Quidditch.
Chaser, because I think they'd get to do the most flying. I wish it were possible!
10. If you could go on a date with any professional athlete, who would it be and where would you take him/her?
Joe Mauer of the Minnesota Twins, and I'd bring him to my teammate Lu's house because I know she'd be extremely jealous.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The season is only five days old, but men’s Ivy League basketball is already 12 games deep. Sitting at a collective 5-7, the Ancient Eight has seen mixed results (to be expected in non-conference play), but it’s never too early to name some winners and losers for the opening days of play.
WINNERS
Preseason favorite Princeton could not have started its season off on a better note last Friday, as it topped Rutgers in overtime, 78-73.  Admittedly, the Scarlet Knights are expected to be a weak team this year, but any BCS win is big. The Tigers got a huge lift from senior guard Dan Mavraides who scored a career-high 26 points, including six three-pointers. As expected, Princeton fell to the reigning national champions, No. 1 Duke, on Sunday, 97-60. The Tigers did not have a realistic shot at competing but at least garnered some exposure on ESPNU.
Freshman guard Miles Cartwright made a big splash in his collegiate debut last Saturday. The highly touted rookie scored 18 points in the first half to help guide Penn to a 69-64 win over Davidson, a performance that earned Cartwright the distinction of Ivy League Rookie of the Week. The Quakers and Brown, which beat Fordham in its opener, are the only Ivies without a loss.
Junior co-captain Keith Wright had the best game of his career in Harvard’s opening loss to George Mason. The big man poured in 22 points and grabbed 16 rebounds in the 66-53 thrashing. The defeat was no fault of Wright’s who had half of the Crimson’s field goals. His effort did not go unnoticed, as the forward was named Ivy League Player of the Week.
LOSERS
Yale’s two defeats to start the season—to Quinnipiac and Providence (both respectable showings)—are not even the Bulldogs biggest loss so far. That distinction would go to the departure of captain Michael Sands. Sands, an All-Ivy honorable mention a year ago and Yale’s best returning player, left the school earlier in the week for personal reasons. Bulldog coach James Jones did not know whether the senior would eventually return. With games against Boston College, No. 16 Illinois, and Army coming up, Yale is staring a 0-5 start in the face.
Surely, Harvard freshman Laurent Rivard will find his stroke, but the guard struggled mightily in his first game in Crimson. Rivard—many pundits’ preseason pick for Ivy League Rookie of the Year—went 0-11 from the floor, including 0-7 from three-point land in losing to the Patriots. Harvard as a team, without Wright’s contributions, shot 9 of 43 (20.9 percent) on field goals.

Harvard Dynamo, the self-defined "boundlessly pan-scientific think tank" of the college, hosted "Rube Goldberg Day" on Saturday. The event was named after the famous cartoonist Rube Goldberg, who was known for drawing out complex devices to perform simple tasks.
Using the event's namesake as inspiration, Dynamo provided participants with an eclectic mix of materials and encouraged them to build a complex machine that achieved a simple goal: popping a balloon. The winning team, composed of graduate students from Harvard and other nearby schools, was awarded prizes of wind-up dinosaurs and rubber-duck squirters.

U.S. News & World Report just can’t seem to get enough of Harvard. It was no surprise when the magazine ranked Harvard College the best in the country, but now a new study conducted by the magazine reveals that Harvard has the most representation among the CEOs of America’s 100 largest companies.
According to the study, 15 Harvard graduates are at the helm of one of America’s 100 largest companies. Ten of these individuals have graduate degrees and five have degrees from Harvard College. Among the more notable names are J.P. Morgan Chase CEO James L. Dimon HBS ’82, GE CEO Jeffery R. Immelt HBS ’82, and Microsoft CEO Steven A. Ballmer ’77.
The study shows that there was really little competition for the top spot. Columbia and the University of Pennsylvania are the second most represented each with seven graduates on the list. As usual, Yale fell short of Harvard. With a mere three graduates achieving the position of CEO at a top company, Yale tied for seventh place.
This is not the only study by the magazine touting the success of Harvard graduates. According to an article published by the magazine earlier this year, Harvard is also the most represented university in US Congress with 15 members with degrees from Harvard College. Many more have graduate degrees.

If you've gone to Lamont some time in the past two weeks, you may have noticed little black boxes attached to the front of the gates at the main entrance. Additionally, you may have ignored them, swiped your ID anyway, and proceeded through the swinging gates as usual.
Well, swipe no more! The new black boxes are proximity card readers that allow patrons to tap and go instead of swiping, according to Beth Brainard, director of communications for Harvard College Library.
As it turns out, work needed to be done on the Lamont turnstiles (the gates) themselves, and Harvard College Library figured, why not give the new card readers a try? Brainard added that the old magnetic strip readers are going to stick around for patrons with library stack passes that aren't programmed with the technology for the proximity readers.
"This is a pretty simple thing," Brainard said.
The extra two seconds you save means an extra two seconds to socialize in Lamont Cafe. Enjoy.
