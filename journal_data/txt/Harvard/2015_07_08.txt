After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Francis J. Doyle III starts his stint as dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at the start of next month, he will take the helm of a school that just received the largest donation in Harvard’s history and that is slated to relocate to Allston in just four years.
SEAS faculty members, while praising Doyle’s appointment, suggest that their new dean will face challenges in ushering the growing school through an era of major transition and a major capital campaign.
Doyle, chair of the chemical engineering department at the University of California Santa Barbara, received his undergraduate degree at Princeton and graduate degrees at the University of Cambridge and the California Institute of Technology. Venkatesh “Venky” Narayanamurti, who led SEAS from 1998 to 2008, said Doyle has a strong background in two growth areas at SEAS: bioengineering and computation.
“In terms of his background, he’s very suited for what needs to be done,” he said.
Doyle said his experience of teaching at three engineering schools and being educated at another three provides him with a rich perspective on how to bring best practices to Harvard. But given that he was not previously employed there, adapting to Harvard will take some time, according to his predecessors.
Narayanamurti, who was also a faculty member at UCSB before coming to SEAS, said Doyle’s biggest challenge will be to understand the culture at Harvard. Cherry A. Murray, who stepped down as the school’s most recent permanent dean last year, agreed.
“Harvard is very complicated,” she said. “I spent some time in the University of California system, which is very complicated because they have 10 campuses. But it’s not as complex as Harvard.”
The dean of SEAS not only heads a school, but also reports to the dean of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences. That translates into more time spent on day-to-day tasks: “That means there are twice as many meetings to go to,” Murray said. “Just getting used to go to these gazillion meetings is going to be a challenge.”
For his part, Doyle said he comes to Harvard with “a mental clean slate,” and adds that his first task after assuming the deanship in August will be “to listen.”
“I can’t presuppose as an outsider coming all the way from the West Coast,” he said. “I’m not coming in with a heavy-handed agenda.”
Computer Science professor Margo I. Seltzer said one of the challenges Doyle will face is creating a unified school when it includes two groups of people separated by physical distance–while two-thirds of SEAS faculty are expected to move to Allston in 2019, some teaching areas will remain in Cambridge on Harvard’s main campus.
Doyle said he will try to overcome the geographical hurdle by making the new Allston campus as attractive as possible. “My goal would be to continue to pull people across the bridge to the extended campus, and [enable them to] continue the interactions they enjoy today,” he said.
Applied Physics professor Jene A. Golovchenko said he is looking to the new dean to bring positive changes to the growing school.
“There is a perception amongst many SEAS faculty that the school’s administration has grown remote, top-down, inefficient and focused on internal agendas and power, subject to making perfunctory decisions, perhaps distracted by the exigencies of managing and raising money for the move to Allston,” Golovchenko said. “I am truly looking forward to a new beginning, with a new dean, a clarity of mission and vision, all inspired and energized by Paulson’s generous gift to Harvard and SEAS.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: July 8, 2015, at 10:25 a.m.
The U.S. Department of Education has dismissed a complaint filed against Harvard this spring by 64 Asian-American groups accusing the University of discriminating based on race in its admissions practices.
The complaint, filed in May, accused the University of unfairly denying admission to highly qualified Asian-American students while admitting similar applicants of other races. Complainants called for an in-depth investigation of Harvard’s use of race in its admissions processes.
The complaint was the most recent public challenge to the College’s race-based affirmative action policies, which were repeatedly under fire this past academic year but administrators argue are crucial to supporting campus diversity. The Department of Education decided to dismiss the complaint, according to a statement, because it is similar to an ongoing and separate federal lawsuit filed against Harvard.
A lawsuit filed last November by Students for Fair Admissions, an anti-affirmative action group, also alleged that Harvard admissions practices discriminate against Asian-American applicants. That case has not yet been resolved, and lawyers representing Harvard have filed a motion to delay it until a verdict is reached on Fisher v. University of Texas, another affirmative action case that the U.S. Supreme Court recently agreed to review a second time. 
The same man—Edward Blum, the director of Project on Fair Representation, a group that opposes race-based affirmative action policies—is behind the cases against both Harvard and the University of Texas.
Harvard has repeatedly denied allegations that its admissions policies are discriminatory.
University Vice President and General Counsel Robert W. Iuliano ’83 defended Harvard’s practice in a May statement, writing that Harvard’s “approach to admissions is fully lawful.”
About 21 percent of Harvard’s incoming freshman class is Asian-American.
The 64 groups filed their May complaint against Harvard with both the federal Departments of Education and Justice. While the Education Department has dismissed the complaint, the Department of Justice has not told complainants that it will do the same, according to Yukong Zhao, one of the organizers behind the complaint.
Still, Zhao said he is “very disappointed” by the Education Department’s move to dismiss the complaint. Zhao said he hopes Harvard will be investigated by the Department of Justice and added that the groups may pursue an expanded complaint to include other Ivy League colleges.
“We are considering expanding the scope of our complaint,” Zhao said, arguing that “there are lots of other Ivy League schools discriminating against Asians” without their own pending discrimination lawsuits.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: July 10, 2015, 1:50 p.m.
Lawyers representing Harvard filed a motion on Monday to delay a lawsuit that alleges that the University’s admissions processes discriminate based on race until the U.S. Supreme Court reviews Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, another affirmative action case, a second time next term.
University spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in a statement that the case Harvard faces “deals with the same fundamental issues” as the Fisher case, which involves a white woman who argues that the University of Texas’s consideration of race in admissions decisions is in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The Supreme Court first heard the case in 2013 and sent the case back to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the University of Texas’s admissions process. In June, the Supreme Court decided to hear the case for the second time.
The lawsuit against Harvard, filed in November by an anti-affirmative action group, accuses Harvard of “employing racially and ethnically discriminatory policies” against Asian-American applicants.
Both lawsuits threaten race-based affirmative action policies that many universities, including Harvard, argue are important to supporting campus diversity. They are backed by the same person, Edward Blum, the director of the group Project on Fair Representation, which opposes race-based affirmative action.
Despite recent scrutiny, Harvard has repeatedly defended its use of race as one factor among others in admissions decisions; in a May statement, University Vice President and General Counsel Robert W. Iuliano ’83 said the College’s policies are “fully compliant with the law.”
The motion filed to delay the lawsuit Harvard currently faces, however, seems to acknowledge that the Supreme Court’s ruling in Fisher could offer a new interpretation of the legality of race-based affirmative action policies.
“The disposition of Fisher has the potential to significantly affect this litigation because [Fisher] presents the Supreme Court with an opportunity to clarify the law governing how public universities may consider race in the admissions process,” says the motion, which Harvard filed in a federal district court on Monday.
Still, Blum, who is behind the Harvard lawsuit, maintains that the case should not be delayed.
"The facts in this case will remain the same regardless of the Fisher case,” Blum wrote in an email Tuesday. “The judge should not allow Harvard to continue its quota to cap the number of Asians the college admits by halting discovery."
Legal observers say that the Fisher case could affect Harvard beyond a possible delay on the admissions lawsuit it faces now. A Supreme Court ruling in favor of Fisher could mean an end to race-based affirmative action policies not just at public universities, but at private ones like Harvard.
“The fact that the Supreme Court took this case back is bad news for the proponents of affirmative action,” said Richard D. Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, a liberal think tank. Kahlenberg has been a paid consultant to the plaintiffs in the Harvard lawsuit.
Parke P. Muth, a former associate dean of admissions at the University of Virginia who now runs a college consulting business, said now that the Court has considered the case once, the nine justices will focus on defining the terms used by colleges to defend affirmative action policies, such as “diversity” and the use of a “holistic” admissions process.
“A lot of people have questioned… the terms that are being used,” Muth said. “How do you know when you have enough? When you say we’re looking for a diverse class, what does that mean?”
According to Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law, these upcoming cases will only add to an ongoing discussion about race, diversity, and alleged discrimination in higher education.
“Fisher v. Texas will not end all litigation,” Lake said. “We’ll just have to see what happens. It’s going to be a fascinating moment.”
The University of North Carolina—Chapel Hill, which faces a similar lawsuit, has also requested a delay of litigation pending Fisher.
