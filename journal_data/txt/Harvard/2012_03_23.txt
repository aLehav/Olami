In his short story “Funes, His Memory,” Argentine author Jorge Luis Borges describes a man called Funes blessed with perfect memory. The reader, at least, is inclined to think him blessed, at least until Borges shows the darker consequences of a brain filled “like a garbage heap.” Incapable of forgetting the smallest sensation, image, or thought, Funes is crippled by the buzzing confusion of his own mind. The cursed protagonist never stirs from his own bed, unwilling to risk adding new memories to those that he already cannot erase. Borges understood that the ability to forget is at least as important as the ability to remember.
Such is the case, too, with nations, and there is much that Argentina would rather forget. Not even four decades stand between Argentina’s current democracy and a brutal dictatorship that tortured and killed 30,000 of its own citizens. Many of those responsible continue to walk the streets, occasionally appearing for television interviews and protected by blanket pardons offered in the 1990s. “Nobody even expects justice here anymore,” the Argentine novelist Marcos Aguinis wrote, “and it is easier just to forget.”
Ulises de la Orden, an Argentine documentary filmmaker, would rather not forget. In a country struggling to bury the recent past, de la Orden is obsessed with excavating the crimes of the fledgling Argentine nation-state from the midst of the 19th century. His latest film, “Tierra Adentro” (“The Land Within”), focuses on the little-known Desert Conquest of the 1870s, a campaign that extended Argentina’s borders into the depths of South America, uprooting and largely extinguishing entire indigenous tribes in the process.
“Like any good middle-class Argentine,” de la Orden said in a television interview, “I had never met a Mapuche,” the principle tribe targeted during the Desert Conquest. “Everything that has been written about the Mapuche,” he continued, “was written by the victors. So I decided, okay, it’s time to hear the other side of the story.”
But the other side of the story turned out to be well hidden. While the victors of the Desert Conquest—men with storied Argentine names like Roca, Alvear, and Ortega—are memorialized on rearing horses in imposing statues throughout the Argentine capital, the language and culture of the Mapuche have been pushed to the fringe of Argentinean society. Ultimately, “Tierra Adentro” is less concerned with the story of the Desert Conquest itself than with the way in which memory and history collide in 21st-century Argentina. “My goal,” said de la Orden, “is to talk about the past from the perspective of the present. That involves more than just historical archives.”
To that end, the film weaves together several distinct stories. The first is that of Pablo, a teenaged Argentine who begins to explore his Mapuche roots. De la Orden documents Pablo haltingly speaking his first words of Mapuche, learning to wear a traditional Mapuche headdress, and observing a tribal dance. But more interesting are the contradictions that Pablo encounters as he slowly warms to the stigmatized culture of his ancestors.
There is, for example, the jarring contrast between the Argentine history taught in public schools, and the history that Pablo learns from Mapuche activists. Those portrayed as heroes during morning classes are denounced as murderers during evening meetings. A particularly telling scene captures Pablo lingering in front of a statue of an Argentine general on his way home from school, as if understanding for the first time the chasm separating Argentine national memory from Mapuche history. A second strand of the film follows Marcos O’Farrell, a musician and great-grandson of one of the generals who led the Desert Conquest, as he earnestly examines the wrongdoings of his own ancestors.
The film’s most poignant moment comes as O’Farrell visits one of just a few remaining Mapuche villages and explains that he is the descendant of General Racedo. An initial hush of disbelief slowly gives way to an invitation to tea and conversation. While de la Orden never suggests that the horrors of the past can be undone with friendly chitchat, “Tierra Adentro” makes clear that the Mapuche view dialogue and mutual acknowledgment as progress.
The film’s greatest success is that it serves as proof that the past is best met with open eyes and a steady gaze. History can feel like a vast graveyard that we cannot escape, and, like Borges’ Funes, we may be doomed to remember the tragic errors of our ancestors. But in remembering, we find an antidote to future folly, painful as that process may be.

I’m not sure when or why I became obsessed with birds, but as far back as I can remember, Big Bird was my favorite Sesame Street character, Lugia was my favorite Pokémon, and Woodstock was my favorite Peanuts character. In kindergarten, I fancied myself a “bird photographer” and ran around taking pictures of robins and cowbirds in our backyard with the family camera. Since our camera was meant for cutesy family portraits rather than high-definition wildlife photography, the birds looked more like little black specks, but I kept on trying, convinced I just hadn’t gotten the hang of it yet. I nearly got in a car wreck once when I swerved into another lane, thinking I had spotted a rare bird species in my rearview mirror. As it turns out, it was just a mockingbird.
 
Though I grew up studying bird field guides and filling our backyard bird feeder, I never went on a hardcore birding expedition. While I was outdoors, I could identify a majority of the birds I saw and recognize a few birdsongs, but that was about it.
 
Real birders are not content with simply recognizing a few birds while strolling outside. They wake hours before dawn, arm themselves with binoculars, spotting scopes, field guides, and birdsong recordings, and seek out obscure habitats to hunt—figuratively speaking—the birds they long to see. They know how to differentiate what I had always called “those little brown birds” into a dozen unique species based upon the slightest differences in plumage or beak shape—and they can do so after a half-second’s glance from 100 meters away.
 
I know this now because that is precisely what I spent spring break doing. When my biology class offered a spring break trip to Panama for birding, I knew this was my chance to try out the real thing.
 
That’s how I wound up ankle-deep in mud while hiking through a rainy jungle and squinting at lofty treetops in hopes of glimpsing a quetzal. That’s also how I wound up dodging incoming traffic as I hooted like a pygmy owl at a highway roadside in an attempt to draw some songbirds closer and how I ended up watching through a telescope as a pair of bellbirds suddenly got rather intimate with each other. I hadn’t previously known that bird sex looked so wildly uncomfortable for both parties involved.
 
Such outdoor experiences are typically seen as the antithesis of geekiness: it’s you versus nature, relying purely on your eyes and ears to take in as much as you can. You can’t ask Wikipedia what bird you just saw, and there’s no associated trading card game or comic book. But while I was on the trip, I couldn’t help but think of how all this identifying, classifying, and searching felt like one of my geekier hobbies. When my T.F. excitedly pointed out a rare bird, my first thought was, “My God, this is just like Pokémon!”
 
Actually, the Pokémon comparison is alarmingly accurate: you spend a lot of your time trawling through tall grass waiting for wild Pokémon (birds) to appear, you get really excited if it’s a rare species as opposed to just another Pidgey (tropical kingbird), and you frantically fill your Pokédex (notebook) with all your sightings. And I’m pretty sure I wasn’t the only one who was thinking this: near the end of the trip, when we saw a quetzal in the rainforest, one of my classmates exclaimed, “He looks like Articuno!”
 
But, unlike Pokémon, which tends to get a bit tiresome after you’ve caught about a hundred of the little critters, it’s hard to imagine ever getting bored of birding. The lows are lower—waking up at 4:30 a.m., which is usually my bedtime, to wander through a tick-infested forest is way rougher than losing a Pokémon gym battle—but the highs are infinitely higher. Spotting the quetzals in the rainforest, perched and shimmering bright green in canopy while rain came trickling down, was far superior to any venture I ever recall involving Pikachu.

At almost any wine tasting, the same precisely obscure terminology is used to describe the taste of the drink: a scent of stone fruit, balanced flavors, excessively young tannins. But to me, a certain unknown German wine evoked more unfamiliar qualities: a scent of gasoline or paint thinner, watery—perhaps not the sort of flavor profile the traditional elitists of the wine world would deem worthy of such analysis. But I found it intriguing. Sitting in Brooklyn Winery, as I sipped my friend’s wine—poured from draft, no less—I believed the taste to signify the end of elitism in the wine world.
 
Wine has often been seen as a luxury item, where a higher price tag is associated with a higher quality product. This supposedly necessary costliness, combined with an extremely obscure, specialized terminology for wine description, is enough to intimidate any amateur oenophile. But, most of all, it has been the enduring strength of tradition itself in the wine world that has made its consumption unreachable for many. 
 
According to conventional wisdom, there are proper methods for decanting and serving wine, coupled with appropriate settings for doing so—fine dining, romantic dates, fancy parties. But Brooklyn Winery sets out to challenge all of these assumptions and to make the world of wine more accessible in the process. There is no air of pretension, no staunch holding to tradition. Brooklyn Winery makes wine from California-grown grapes in-house and serves them on draft. They have trivia nights, beer nights, and half-glass tastings every night. They even provide an extensive guide in the back of their wine menu explaining wine flavors, common terminology, and grape varietals.
 
Most compelling of all, though, Brooklyn Winery also offers various “winemaking” packages, enabling customers to crush their own grapes or design their own labels.  In these simple acts of creativity, power is reattributed—that is, the power to know and enjoy good wine and to determine how to enjoy it—from the winemakers and professional critics to the individual citizen. As Brooklyn Winery’s site reads, “No wine snobbery allowed!”
 
Brooklyn Winery is part of a growing movement in the wine world that is edging towards accessibility and democratization. As reported by the wine industry blog on Winespiritsdaily.com, younger consumers of wine are not only partially responsible for the 13-year annual boost in wine drinking, but also seek adventure in their wine choices. We millenials “view wine as an affordable luxury” and “don’t see wine as elitist or unattainable,” according to the site. The record number of attendees this year in the non-credit wine course taught by Harvard Kirkland House Master and Abbott Lawrence Lowell Professor of Romance Languages and Literatures and of Visual and Environmental Studies Tom Conley seems to support these claims. Students come to the bi-weekly seminar interested and involved, eagerly conquering an ever more accessible body of knowledge in the world of wine.
 
Indeed, the wine industry is well aware of these new wine consumers pushing towards egalitarianism. A number of wine brands and retailers have catered to this need, including one company in particular, 90+ Cellars (for whom I have the pleasuring of working as an intern). 
90+ Cellars buys highly rated wine from across the globe, bottles it under their own label, and sells it at a fraction of the original price. Such methods allow for the flourishing of accessibility to great wine, or as 90+ Cellar’s tagline reads, to provide “Great Wine. Anytime.” 
 
So forget that fancy cheese pairing for your sauvignon blanc, and try some take-out sushi instead. Forget buying from a fancy winery, and try making your wine at home. And forget the classic glass decanter, and try, as author of “Modernist Cuisine” Nathan Myhrvold suggests, to decant your wine in a blender. While some traditions are great in their own right, in challenging tradition there is a more vital challenge to the elitism and snobbery of the wine world and a move toward more democratic drinking.

There are few albums with better openings than “Sticky Fingers” by the Rolling Stones. Seven fuzzy chords, unmistakably played in Keith Richards’ signature open tuning, ring out tremulously. Then drummer Charlie Watts breaks the reverie with a crisp pop on the snare, bassist Bill Wyman starts churning away, and the band is off, strutting and snarling, as if hurtling through the cotton fields of the American South in a Bentley S3 Continental. In 1971, the Stones—with their British cars, thick accents, and skinny jeans—were distinctly foreign to American audiences. But on “Brown Sugar,” they took a few simple chords, a wailing sax, and a whole lot of bravado, and burst through the Atlantic and across the Mason-Dixon Line as if they owned the land.
 
This is exactly what I hoped to do, nearly 40 years later, in the summer after senior year of high school. In the spring of that year, my friends and I decided to plan a big road trip together, away from the tedium of ten periods a day, from curfews and familial obligations. College was around the corner with all of its glorious freedom. As a group, we were coming out of our shell, spurred on by the success of our absurd punk-pop band that was gaining school-wide recognition. This was the beginning of the best times of our lives, we told ourselves. Let’s travel, do stupid things, and remember them forever.
 
It was in this idealistic mindset that I adopted “Sticky Fingers” as my soundtrack. The Beatles, with their astounding arrangements and harmonies, had always been my favorite band. But what the Stones lacked in musical intricacy they made up for with sheer force. Bruce Springsteen said that Dylan’s “Like a Rolling Stone” kicked open the door of his mind; the first two chords of “Brown Sugar” razed the path to what I was sure at the time would be a rebellious adolescence. Even though I was jumping only from one wildly successful British rock band to another, the Stones packed a different kind of punch and a whole new attitude.
 
“Sticky Fingers” was a revelation. The first few times I listened to it all the way through I was underwhelmed. It seemed a little too short and scattered and not up to the rigorous songwriting standards of Lennon and McCartney, but I found myself listening to the album quite a lot anyway. Most of it didn’t have to do with the songs themselves but rather with they way they were delivered. “Wild Horses” is a fairly standard ballad with simple chord changes and melody, but when Mick Jagger raggedly mumbles over Keith Richard’s prickly strumming, the song becomes defiantly poignant. And I listened to “Can’t You Hear Me Knocking” less for its melody and more for the four-and-a-half-minute blues freak out at the end, which is light on substance but rife with a possessed energy. 
 
The Stones were on my mind as I sat on my friend’s roof in late senior year, discussing our grand plans for the summer. Several of my friends wanted to make the customary backpack trip through Europe, but I wanted to go south. I wanted to escape the bleak, cold and painted black cities of the North to take in the fresh air. “I could’ve stayed here for days,” wrote Keith Richards about the South in his autobiography, “Life.” “You walk out and there’s sweat all over you and perfume, and we all get in the car, smelling good, and the music drifts off in the background. I think some of us had died and gone to heaven.” I began to have daydreams about local bars with old blues musicians, cornbread, and ribs and driving down little dirt roads, blasting “Bitch” on full volume.
 
The trip, of course, never panned out. It was a far-fetched idea with little to no concrete details or funds. I spent that summer bumming around at home and taking care of my sister. And after that, I went to college, went to class, and did my schoolwork, and things were entirely normal. I never quite found the crazed spirit of the Glimmer Twins in me. But I still listen to “Sticky Fingers” as a faint promise of an eventual personal metamorphosis. Every break when I go back home, my friends mention the trip and declare that it will happen the coming summer. It probably won’t. But no vacation could ever live up to the road trip that is “Sticky Fingers.” The album is motivation to be more assertive and a reassurance that my next personal breakthrough is “just about a moonlight mile, on down the road.”

Women’s reproductive health in America is under assault. Many state legislatures have recently debated or passed laws requiring women to undergo patronizing, invasive, and expensive procedures before they are allowed to have an abortion.  Contraception, too, has suddenly become a topic of debate among politicians and pundits, although 99% of American women who have sex have used birth control and public health experts widely agree that it is an essential part of women’s health care.  Rush Limbaugh even went so far as to defame Sandra Fluke as a “slut” and a “prostitute” for the sin of testifying before Congress on the necessity of insurance coverage for birth control. These events demonstrate a troubling attitude in America: that it is acceptable to demean and disparage women for their sexual and reproductive choices.
This attitude pervades our national discourse, and Harvard is no exception. Last month, a poster campaign across campus promulgated the following, seemingly benign, message: “I want to be 34 percent less likely than my peers to experience separation or divorce.  My sexual choices now are making a difference.”  This campaign was an effort by True Love Revolution, in coordination with the inter-collegiate Love and Fidelity Network, to convince students to wait until marriage to have sex. Below the tagline, the posters elaborated: “Women who had their first sexual encounter prior to their first marriage have been shown to be about 34 percent more likely to experience marital dissolution.” Though much more polite than Rush Limbaugh, and less invasive than state lawmakers, this campaign exemplified the troubling national attitude that misunderstands and demeans women and sexuality. Although there are legitimate reasons for making the personal choice to abstain until marriage, this campaign did not make those arguments, and instead presented misleading statistics and patronizing gender stereotypes.
Briefly ignoring the posters’ social message, the campaign has an enormous flaw: correlation does not imply causation. These posters take a correlational statistic—that people who have sex before marriage get divorced more frequently than those who do not—and use this to claim that by having premarital sex now, you putting your future marriage in danger. Although the survey in question consider certain possible confounding factors, including religion and education level, it is impossible for any survey to determine that one factor causes another. A randomized, controlled study would be the only way to demonstrate such causality—based only on the data from this survey, it could just as easily be that people who decide to have premarital sex are also independently more likely to decide to divorce. For example, perhaps women who feel empowered to have sex before marriage might feel similarly empowered to leave an unhealthy or abusive marriage. From the opposite perspective, perhaps women who are less devoted to the idea of abstinence also tend to be less devoted to the idea of marriage.
However, True Love Revolution is not only guilty of a poor understanding of statistics. By targeting women specifically—whether this was intentional or merely thoughtless—this poster campaign perpetuates sexist attitudes by placing unequal demands on women and men. It implies that women bear the responsibility for refraining from sex, and that any woman who does not follow these standards deserves blame for ruining both her own and her future husband’s marriage, while the man, apparently, remains blameless.
Not only does this poster campaign create a double standard for men and women, but it also denies women agency in their married lives. By referring to “marital dissolution” as something one might “experience,” the posters imply that divorce is something that just happens to you, dictated unavoidably by your past. In reality, divorce is a decision made by one or both members of a marriage, something that you as an individual have control over. After putting the entire burden of responsibility on women to abstain from premarital sex, these posters suddenly deny women—and also men—any of the same agency in the process of divorce.
Moreover, this campaign implies that divorce is something to be avoided at all costs. While divorce is by no means a pleasant experience, it may be preferable to staying in an abusive or miserable marriage. It is judgmental and unfair to assume that you know whether it is right for someone else to remain married—not to mention to draw conclusions about marriages that haven’t even happened yet. These posters function on the assumption that a woman must want nothing more than to be married to one person her whole life, no matter how circumstances may change over the course of that marriage or what sacrifices she must make to reach that goal.
If the members of True Love Revolution believe that it is morally wrong to have sex before marriage, they should say so, and we can debate that idea on its own merits. However, it is intellectually dishonest to present misleading statistics. It is demeaning and offensive to create a double standard in which women, and women alone, are to be judged for their sexual behavior. And it is equally demeaning and offensive to deny women’s agency in their future married lives. If True Love Revolution wants to make a case for abstinence, they should do so without hiding behind faulty logic and patronizing rationalizations. Let’s talk about these issues, but let’s do so in good faith.

Global news has been traditionally dominated by powerful, oligopolistic Western media outlets. Companies like CNN, newspapers like the New York Times, and magazines like the Economist dominate coverage of current events. Although these outlets can often be praised for their high quality news coverage and investigative reporting, the amount of contact these western-based companies have with the developing world is questionable. For this reason, the arrival of developing world and now established news services, like Al Jazeera, alongside traditional services, like the BBC is important and gratifying. However, large media outlets, whether Western or not, remain non-ideal news sources for coverage of the developing world. This makes it vital that local, home-grown news services provide coverage of the areas that they alone understand best.
Western media has without doubt made a positive impact by covering news in developing countries. For example, CNN helped expose Chinese human rights abuses against Tibetans, bringing attention to the plight of the Tibetan people to the rest of the world despite its surrounding controversy. The coverage of El Salvador’s El Mozote Massacre in 1994 by the New York Times and the Washington Post triggered the severance of ties by the U.S. with the El Salvadorian government and military. Western media has undoubtedly acted as a watchdog for human rights abuses in the past, especially for women. Countless abuses in the developing world that would otherwise receive little attention have been uncovered, whether it is the treatment of women in Afghanistan or female genital mutilation in Northern Africa.
However, the positive impact Western media has had on these developing nations is limited. The dominance of Western global news outlets can prevent regions from providing a more accurate assessment of their current events in their own terms via local media companies. Western media outlets with huge viewership often dominate the discourse on regional affairs that western news services have very little contact with. As a result, regional affairs of the developing world are often misrepresented by western media. An article by Simon Kuper of The Financial Times recently praised Chimurenga, a South Africa-based “Pan-African English language journal” for more accurately depicting the positive and negative aspects of African life. Western media, meanwhile, stands repeatedly at fault for representing a continent of 53 nations, over one billion people, and hundreds of ethnic languages as one homogenous unit and providing little differentiation between the African countries. Surely publications, like Chimurenga, with much smaller readerships provide deeper insights to the African current events than massive western media companies can. Despite the shifts in how consumers receive media and the growing influence of emerging market services, Western media still holds an influential position in global information. While still retaining this strong position, it is important for these companies to incorporate local voices and opinion as often as possible in order to portray regional affairs more accurately.
Naturally, Western media outlets often only have limited access to parts of the developing world, both legally and informally. Resultantly, their coverage of current events and investigative reports will be limited. In these circumstances, regional bodies have been very good at filing the void in carrying out strong investigative reporting. For example, Al Jazeera, an Arabic language news network based in Qatar, provides reliable news coverage of Middle Eastern Affairs. It played a significant role in exposing the desire of the Libyan people for international intervention during the Libyan Revolution in 2011, a large factor in the approval of NATO intervention by the Security Council. South African magazines such as the Star and Drum helped bring attention to the atrocities committed by the Apartheid government against the majority black population. South African photographers such as Greg Marinovich and Kevin Carter captured the South African race riots and the famine in Sudan respectively in images that would be re-printed across the world. These local media companies were able to do what the Western media could not—portray the developing world accurately and attract massive amounts of attention because of their realistic reporting.
Credit must be given to the success of Western media outlets in investigating human rights abuses in the past. However, the present day provides more and more alternatives for news reporting to the handful of western media conglomerates. If this trend were to continue, and local, smaller-case coverage of developing world news increase, it would be good for the world.

Women’s Week brought discussions about the roles of men and women to campus, but how can we turn that awareness into a lasting political drive? We can look to consciousness-raising, a political tool of the 1970s women’s movement that should be revived today.
Consciousness-raising came out of the civil rights movement, where black people were encouraged to share their experiences of oppression and “tell it like it is.” The idea as applied to women’s movement is this: While women assume the problems they face, such as unhappy marriages or the difficulty of reconciling a feminine ideal with their own identity, are personal, these have their roots in a society-wide system of oppression. By pooling their experiences and comparing them, women can more fully understand how sexism functions and work against it.
Small groups—around ten people—meet on a regular basis in order to pose questions and share answers. These questions can vary from inquiries into one’s own identity (“Do you worry about being ‘truly feminine’?”) aspirations, (“What do you want to do in life? What kept you from doing it?”) and one’s sense of larger social structures (“How do you relate to women of different classes or races?”). The group then analyzes the responses and draws connections from what has been said.
A few friends and I started our own group earlier this year, and I can say without hesitation that it is one of the best things I have done in college. Consciousness-raising doesn’t just mean critiquing stereotypes; it asks women to take a deep and careful look at what they really want. It is from consciousness-raising that the phrase “the personal is political” arose, and this is one of the practice’s greatest concepts: That what happens in the family or the bedroom is not exempt from scrutiny or “trivial;” that although a setback may feel like a private failure, the conditions that produce it go far beyond the personal; that women can work together to create equality in all spheres of existence, not just those subsumed under the law or in the economy. From our conversations, I have learned of hindrances that I could never have imagined on my own—I was surprised to discover, for example, how strongly the ideal of being a good mother weighs on women my age, despite the expectation that both parents will now share household duties equally.
To be sure, consciousness-raising cannot stand alone as a political endeavor. For one, it does not always allow room for interpretations that do not come out of the experiences of those present. Too much stress on finding commonalities can undermine real differences, differences which are key to inequality. As feminist intellectual Ellen J. Willis wrote in her essay “Radical Feminism and Feminist Radicalism,” describing her own encounters with consciousness-raising, “The emphasis on personal experience tended to obscure and mystify the fact that we all interpreted our experience through the filter of prior political and philosophical assumptions.” I would encourage anyone who starts up a consciousness-raising group to recognize this. But this limitation does not undermine the practice: One cannot begin to sketch the contours of one’s own worldview without laying out the particularities that compose it.
As a result of the practice’s success, the phrase “consciousness-raising” is still used to describe social activism distinct from the original process. Feminist blogs, for example, are sometimes characterized as platforms for consciousness-raising. Indeed, on paper, they perform many of the same functions. They highlight examples of sexism in different aspects of culture and daily life and provide a forum in which women feel safe to share aspects of their own lives.
However, aside from the difficulty of creating intimacy in a virtual discussion, this kind of sharing misses an important aspect of consciousness-raising. Events that try to raise “awareness” or publications that chronicle discrete examples of sexism present each individual instance as a distinct source of short-lived outrage. Consciousness-raising, by contrast, forces its participants to see specific facts or events as part of a larger and intricate system, one that can and must be altered.
Instead of outrage or despair, consciousness-raising creates strong, constructive, and political emotions as well as a drive toward activism and change. Over the past few months, I have felt joy at the intelligence and perception of my peers, excitement at our own capacity for analysis, and anger that despite great advances in women’s rights, so much remains unchanged. Rather than merely create an awareness of the inequalities that dominate our culture, consciousness-raising produces a deeper understanding of why these inequalities persist. This is the first step in thinking how we might overcome them, and it’s an exhilarating feeling! As we look to improve our own lives and those of the people around us, consciousness-raising is a good place to begin.

By all accounts, Suzanne Collins’s series “The Hunger Games” has been the mass-cultural event of the year. The statistics are suitably enormous, the tickets to the movie as scarce as potable water in the Arena, where the majority of the book’s action takes place. Fandango has announced that the advanced ticket sales for the premiere this weekend are on track to be the largest ever for a non-sequel. Collins is the top-selling Kindle author ever, and “The Hunger Games” has been sublimed into rarefied air alongside Twilight and Harry Potter. In an age where the book is more often a subject of eulogy than praise, what does “The Hunger Games” have to tell us about how and why we read today? Risking the liquidation of whatever small amounts of cultural capital I may have accumulated, I resolved to find out.
One perennial explanation for the rise of the novel, a category to which “The Hunger Games” nominally belongs, as the most popular literary mode is that we read to meet people like us. We live in a circumscribed time and place, and are constrained in all kinds of ways from fully exploring the human landscape around us. Books allow us to transcend those limitations, but also reassure us that people everywhere are basically the same; our group of friends would make fine material for a novel, if only we could have the time and insight to write. Books that take place in an undisclosed future, like “The Hunger Games,” have the advantage of mapping difference and continuity chronologically, a maneuver that is especially effective at highlighting similarity and difference.
A brief summary of the as-yet-uninitiated: “The Hunger Games” is set in a future authoritarian dystopia where children are pitted against each other in a fight to the death. These dystopian Olympics are staged every year as a way for the Capitol (situated where the Rockies are now—who knew!), imagined as a decadent dictatorship, to subdue the Districts, provinces that have been crushed in a revolt and have to furnish tribute as continual acknowledgment of their political abjectness. Male and female young adults are selected from each of the twelve districts and fight each other to the death, with the last survivor declared the victor. The protagonist is Katniss Everdeen, who volunteers for the Games so her sister will not be conscripted. Deft use of a bow and arrow, multiple accounts of how to grill a rabbit, and many awkward romantic scenes ensue.
“The Hunger Games” has received criticism for its depiction of the fatal harm its child protagonists do to one another and the way in which the adolescent body is subjected to increasing amounts of trauma. The appeal of imaginary violence is perennial, but the appeal of “The Hunger Games” lies elsewhere: not in what the children do to each other, but rather in the way the novel so perfectly matches our moment of spectacle. Every Hunger Games book sold is actually a reminder of the extraordinary evolution away from the sufficiency of the book.  Books are read in private as a way to be alone in an enriched and sociable way. They are also discrete units, portable but sufficient. They thus function very much like the Arena, a zone where we can roam freely but under rules and constraints dictated by the “Gamemakers” or author. We meet characters, get to know them, and grow to love or mistrust them. We feel that there are stakes to these encounters, and the narrative insinuates that it is all very significant and will be revealed at the end.
But “The Hunger Games” operates according to a different understanding of what constitutes a literary text; it is almost unfathomably open-ended. In a New York Times article entitled “How ‘Hunger Games’ Built Up Must-See Fever,” Brooks Barnes discusses the tremendous role that technology played In marketing the novel: “a phased, year-long digital effort… near constant use of Facebook and Twitter, a YouTube channel, a Tumblr blog, iPhone games, and live Yahoo streaming.” Of course, the book has always been a consumer product situated within a larger economic climate, but with “The Hunger Games” something different has occurred; the evolution away from the book as an autonomous entity bounded by two covers. It no longer makes sense to discuss the book apart from the movie or the interactive site where you can create a profile that makes you a character.
In some ways, we are protected by a book’s boundedness; “The Hunger Games” is phenomenon without end. The book’s greatest achievement is not only furthering this evolution, but also thematizing its peril and potential. “The Hunger Games” are streamed live, and, in a contemporary take on post-modern self-consciousness, are aware of themselves as televised characters in a reality television show. Many of the most likeable characters in the book—the interview hosts and make-up personnel—are those connected with the televising of the Games, and rightly so. The book, like the characters in it, is worried how it will do on the big screen. Why read The Hunger Games when you can play in them?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A graduate student at Harvard, Itay Budin has been a scientist for as long as he can remember. He spent much of his childhood “playing around”—building airplanes, rockets, and generators.
“I had a lot of computer parts and stuff hanging around,” he said. “I was always building.”
After falling in love with biology in high school, Budin combined his interests during his undergraduate years at Cornell University, where he studied bioengineering.
Today, Budin is a member of the Szostak Lab, headed by Harvard Medical School genetics professor Jack W. Szostak. There, he tackles questions concerning the origin of life on Earth, such as how cells were formed and, specifically, how nonliving chemical elements bridged the gap to become living biological cells.
“These questions are very, very difficult, so you have to take an engineering approach,” Budin said. “You have to...build structures in the lab.”
Budin’s research focuses on the cell membranes of primitive organisms, which are believed to be essential to living cells.
In the lab, Budin builds very simple cells, consisting of a membrane and some genetic material, to examine how basic biological building blocks contribute to life. Budin studies the physical properties of these membranes and how they could have evolved into the more complicated, modern ones that surround cells today.
“Itay has a terrific understanding of physical systems at the molecular level—it is this insight and his creativity that have allowed Itay to do such surprisingly simple but informative experiments on the role of membranes in the origin of life,” said Professor Szostak in an email,
For Budin, the decision to go to graduate school has paid off.
“If you’re really interested in science and you want to do basic research and...fool around in the lab, grad school is the thing to do,” he said.
For his work in the lab, Budin recently received the Harold M. Weintraub Graduate Student Award for outstanding research, which recognizes graduate studies in the biological sciences based on thesis research and publications. Budin was one of just 13 recipients of the award.
He calls it “a nice recognition—science is definitely a long road...so it’s nice to have, along the way, some feedback.”
This fall, Budin will be starting a fellowship at UC Berkley, where he plans to continue his research. And after that?
“Hopefully I can start my own lab and continue to fool around,” he says.

A recent study by Harvard psychologists found that a smart phone application could reduce anxiety for people suffering from social anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety.
The study was conducted by Psychology Professor Richard J. McNally and his graduate student, Philip M. Enock, in collaboration with Stefan G. Hofmann, director of the Social Anxiety Program at Boston University.
The smart phone application uses a method known as “attentional bias modification” to train people to ignore negative stimuli that were causing them unneeded stress in social situations. Subjects were simultaneously presented with two faces, one neutral and one hostile. Participants were instructed to press a letter that appeared on the screen after the faces were displayed.
For participants in the test group, this letter always appeared in the position where the neutral face had been. By redirecting the subject’s attention from the hostile face to the neutral face with the letter, the researchers hoped to train subjects to look away from social cues that would cause anxiety for a person with social anxiety disorder or generalized anxiety.
Participants used this application three times a day, and each session lasted about two minutes. Periodically, they filled out a survey asking them about the level of anxiety they felt in everyday life.
A placebo group used a smart phone application in which the letter was equally likely to appear in place of the neutral face or the hostile face, and a no-treatment group filled out periodic surveys about their level of stress but did not use an application.
The results showed significant alleviation of daily anxiety for those in the test group as well as in the placebo treatment group, and no change for those in the no-treatment group. While encouraged by the participants’ progress, researchers were also confused by the equal outcomes from the active and placebo groups.
Enock said the placebo group may have improved because their choice to use the anxiety-treatment application in itself was empowering. Participants in both groups may also simply have been “expecting some improvement to come along.”
McNally also said that improvements could be because of the “positive aura” surrounding high-tech treatment or because using the application was a method to maintain attention to tasks beyond the game.
The findings are promising but should be viewed with “guarded optimism,” said McNally.
“Right now we really want to make sure we can replicate these effects [and] make them more potent,” he added.
Likewise, Hofmann said that modified studies with larger sample sizes are needed to “examine if attention bias modification has a reliable effect on people’s subjective experience.”
After refinement, said McNally, this type of therapy could provide an alternative to traditional cognitive behavioral therapy for people who do not have access to a trained therapist or who cannot afford professional counseling.
Enock added that the smart phone format is especially well adapted to delivering treatment to a large population—not only for those who are on medication or in therapy, but also those who are currently doing nothing to manage their anxiety.

Media outlets around the world are covering the release of a Harvard School of Public Health study stating that red meat consumption leads to an increased risk in mortality, stirring debate among the public and experts.
“It was beyond our expectation with so many debates being incurred, but we think it’s a good thing,” said An Pan, lead author of the study and research associate at HSPH. “We want more people to realize the potential health risks of eating too much meat.”
The data showed that one daily serving of unprocessed or processed red meat led to a 13 or 20 percent increase in mortality risk, respectively.
“We saw in this paper that [eating red meat] has implications, although the association is modest,” Pan said. “A 13 percent increase is not that high.”
The overall message was for people to try to reduce red meat consumption to two to three servings per week and to replace red meat with healthier choices, according to Pan.
Mortality risks of red meat consumption have been explored repeatedly, though not on the same scale as the 2012 study.
In 2009, for instance, researchers studied half a million people for three years and concluded that high intakes of processed and red meat may increase mortality risk.
Compared to previous research, the 2012 study surveyed a smaller cohort group for a longer period of time, nearly 25 years, and also distinguished between processed and unprocessed meats.
While earlier research focused on meat consumption’s effect on specific maladies, Pan’s study examined the broader impact on mortality.
The study took advantage of data from two long-term and well-known studies.
The Nurses’ Health Study, which began in 1976 to study breast cancer, was expanded to include a diverse population and to look at other health risks. It is widely regarded as one of the most prominent studies in diet and health, according to T. Colin Campbell, an emeritus professor at Cornell who studies nutrition.
“We realize this would be a good population to learn the long term effect on diet and health,” said Walter Willett, chair of the department of nutrition at HSPH who has overseen the study since its expansion in 1986.
The Health Professionals Follow-Up Study follows men ages 40 to 75.
The researchers designed standardized questions about health and have been updating their results every four years.
The study has been critiqued extensively by the expert community. One critique is that people who eat red meat tend to ignore common wisdoms of healthy behavior, creating correlating factors in their risks of mortality.
“This particular group doesn’t adequately acknowledge that,” said David E. Cummmings, a professor of medicine at the University of Washington. “They try to account for this but never fully.”
Willett acknowledged that the researchers cannot be sure to have taken into account all correlating factors.
The American Meat Institute issued a statement the day of publication responding to the study and criticizing its “unreliable self-reporting.”
“We were concerned that the study was quite definitive in its answer,” said Janet M. Riley, senior vice president of the American Meat Institute.

The solution to eradicating the world’s poverty may lie in managing some of the tiniest creatures of the natural world, said Director General of the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE) Christian Borgemeister in a lecture on Monday at the Harvard University Center for the Environment.
Borgemeister works to alleviate poverty through a biological approach, advocating that developing nations can improve their public health infrastructure and agricultural production by controlling pests that infect livestock, destroy crops, and spread disease.
One such pest, which Borgemeister described as “the true African menace,” is the tsetse fly—the insect that is responsible for the transmission of nagana disease in African livestock and human sleeping sickness in local populations.
To combat these diseases—which can cripple local African economies—Borgemeister and his colleagues have developed two novel solutions to ward off the tsetse fly.
The first solution presented—designed to trap the pest—is an “NGU trap” that combines visual and olfactory cues to attract the fly from afar. Once the fly approaches the trap, it whiffs a potent mixture of cow urine and acetone that lures it inside a cloth funnel, where it is killed by the sun’s rays.
Just four NGU traps are needed to rid a square kilometer of tsetse flies, and at approximately ten dollars per trap, Borgemeister said the cost-effectiveness of the contraption makes it a powerful technology.
Borgemeister’s second solution, the “Waterbuck Repellant Blend,” is a special kind of animal spray that inhibits tsetse flies from landing on farmers’ livestock and transmitting disease.
In addition to these insect-targeting solutions to alleviate human and animal diseases, Borgemeister outlined approaches to prevent agricultural losses to invasive crop pests. Not only did he present biochemical approaches—such as the use of adult pheromone phenylacetonitrile (PAN) against the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria—but he also presented innovative planting techniques to prevent wide transmission of pest diseases.
These innovative solutions appealed to student attendees like Ryan Heffrin ’13, who wrote in an emailed statement that Borgemeister “provided an insightful perspective into both the challenges facing agricultural advancement in East Africa [and] the opportunities that are possible with public-private partnerships and extensive stakeholder participation.”
“There is a massive need and potential for improving agricultural yields in some of the poverty-stricken areas of the world,” she continued, “and it was exciting to learn about the work that ICIPE is doing to help bring about this change."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“When you see the mummies, make a right.”
So said Harvard’s Philip J. King Professor of Egyptology Peter Der Manuelian ’81, as he gave directions to his office in the Semitic Musuem at 6 Divinity Avenue.
The Semitic Museum, Harvard’s showcase of Near Eastern Archaeology, is a small, cozy building nestled in between the Biological Laboratories and the Yenching Library. Upon entering, one is greeted by gleaming walls, colorful displays, and perfectly preserved pieces of ancient history of inestimable value.
Between exhibits on “The Houses in Ancient Israel,” and “Monuments from Mesopotamia,” golden statues look down with solemn gazes, while pottery and intricate metalwork shine in the slanted iridescence of sun filtering through the museum windows.
Though the contents ring of the archetypal Harvard museum, the halls feel oddly quiet.
As one of the staff members says, “We don’t get students too often.”
In 2010, Manuelian became Harvard’s first full-fledged Egyptologist on the faculty since George Andrew Reisner, class of 1889. Through his ongoing archaeological research and innovative computer modelling, Manuelian hopes to help ancient Eygypt make a comeback at Harvard and in the intellectual community at large.
A Long-Awaited Arrival
Manuelian’s office contrasts starkly with its immediate environment. In a hall of chariots, spears, and swords sits his modern room, with a digital projector, and a grapefruit-sized rotating globe sitting on the conference table. Clad in a turtle neck sweater and elbow-patch jacket, he offers a polite welcome.  A book under his authorship is visible next to a desk-sized statue of one of the early pharaohs.
Previously, Manuelian served as director of the Giza Archives at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and as a research associate at Harvard.
When asked about what got him interested in Egyptian archaeology, Manuelian smiles reflectively.
“To me I think it was the scale of the monuments, the monumentality of the pyramids and temples, and then the fascinating hieroglyphic language structure, the very graphic and iconographic culture that uses pictures and words together to convey some pretty sophisticated thoughts,” he says. “That, and the longevity of Egyptian civilizations, three millennia or more of pharaonic culture, is a pretty impressive thing to study.”
The Egyptologist is in his fourth decade in the field. He began his archaeological career at the MFA, Boston in the summer of 1976, and began on-site work in Egypt at the Giza Pyramids in the summer of 1977. Manuelian was just out of high school.
During that year, Manuelian was part of an epigraphic expedition—meaning he continued the archiving of materials and artifacts that was not completed by an original expedition’s conclusion. He studied the tombs, their inscriptions, and the architecture of buildings around the pyramids, focusing on works that originated in the fourth dynasty in 2500 BC. After that early phase of his career, Manuelian moved on to more “traditional archaeological sites” and studied pre-dynastic work.
Unbeknownst to many, Harvard has had a long-standing association with the Giza Pyramids: the Harvard University-Boston MFA Expedition ran from 1905 until 1947 in Giza.
The Expedition produced “the greatest assemblage of archaeological materials and archives up until that point by any expedition,” says Manuelian.
Back in the Classroom
Manuelian teaches seven classes, including Egyptian Aa: The Language of the Pharaohs, Egyptian 150: Voices from the Nile: Ancient Egyptian Literature in Translation, and Anthropology 1250: The Pyramids of Giza. He also teaches a General Education course titled Societies of the World 38: Pyramid Schemes: The Archaeological History of Ancient Egypt.
Maggie E. Geoga ’12 has taken Pyramid Schemes, Egyptian Ab, and Egyptian 150 under Manuelian’s instruction. “I loved Pyramid Schemes because the lectures were really engaging and enjoyable, but my favorites are Middle Egyptian and Egyptian Literature because both classes are very small ... and discussion-based, which allows us to delve deeper into certain issues,” Geoga says.
Geoga is excited about the revival of Egyptology in Harvard academia.
“It’s really great to see Egyptology classes in the course catalog,” she says. “If Harvard had had them two years ago, I might have chosen a different concentration.”
In addition, Manuelian has shown no hesitation in integrating the world’s oldest subject matter with the world’s newest technology. To help his students visualize Egyptian life and architecture, Geoga says Manuelian gives his students “3-D tours” of the Giza Pyramids, using computer graphics and images in the Geological Museum’s Visualization Center, across the street from the Semitic Museum.
“Professor Manuelian is a very engaging lecturer because his enthusiasm for the subject is contagious,” Geoga says. “His use of technology ... gives his students a unique understanding of the material and makes the class more fun.”
Bringing Egypt to the World
The bulk of Manuelian’s career has focused on the Giza site, which he describes as a “treasure trove” of relics from one of the longest-living civilizations in human history. For the last decade, he has been working on assembling thousands of dig photographs, diaries, object register books, glass plate negative photographs, and unpublished manuscripts.
“We try to correlate a lot of that older material with the state of the site now; we try to update things so we can do a new excavation where we need to,” Manuelian says.
For Manuelian, the rewards of his archaeological labors come to fruition in the classroom, where Manuelian’s computer modeling is more than just a teaching tool for a seminar class. Manuelian has combined the data from all his years of work at Giza into a massive computer simulation recreating the entire Giza site and its history.
When Manuelian opens his MacBook and navigates to gizapyramids.org, the interwebs bring up a virtually unlimited reservoir of archaeological resources: 3,841 files on tombs, 22,076 on artifacts, and 9,909 on plans and drawing of building design, to name a few.
The second phase of Manuelian’s online opus, which will be available later this year, is an expanded version of the three-dimensional models he uses in class. Watching the projector screen in Manuelian’s office, one sees a sky-view of the Pyramid landscape. The view then zooms down to ground view and a recreation of Egyptian burial ceremony begins, complete with computer-generated avatars of Egyptian priests, laborers, and artisans in the ceremonial square.
As Manuelian explains the site, his face lights up. “Bit by bit we’re trying to build the entire site of Giza,” he says. “My fantasy is that every single tomb, every single pyramid, every burial shaft, every statue will be back in place ... These things allow you to pose new questions about how ritual took place, where it took place, what time of day it was, who was present, who was absent.”
A seamless blend of the scientific and the artistic, Manuelian says these tools are essential to a full appreciation of Giza’s ancient relics.
“Archaeology is very much about context,” Manuelian explains.
“It’s a great way to get a sense of relationships and it’s a matrix of what was earlier and what was later relative to each other. Who’s deep, who’s shallow. It’s a great learning and teaching tool for us.”
Taking Up the Reisner Mantle
Manuelian chuckles when asked about the potential similarities between his work and the “Indiana Jones” films.
In the early 1900s, Harvard Egyptologist Reisner and his fellow archaeologists essentially lived the plot of the first movie.
“[They] lived at Giza in a series of mud brick huts behind the pyramids, and in World War II when they were afraid that the Germans were coming over the hill they actually rounded up all the archival materials and they buried them in a series of burial shafts,” Manuelian said.
Reflecting on early 20th century archaeology, Manuelian has read historical documents that sound as if they could have inspired the other “Indiana Jones” films as well.
“There are accounts of finding a statue, putting the guards on it all night, and finding the statue is gone the next morning, and they try to figure out who knows about it and where it could’ve gone and they get tracking dogs to go down into the village and lead them to the guy’s house,” he says, citing diaries and records of Egyptologists in Reisner’s time.
Manuelian sees Hollywood representations of archaeology as attempts to tell an entertaining story. He is not particularly offended by historical inaccuracies, but he does wish that the heightened awareness of archaeology fostered by blockbuster hits had a more tangible impact in drawing people into the field.
Either way, he says he takes comfort in the fact that the realities of his field are just as, if not more, thrilling than the depictions on the big screen.
“Just to enter into these tombs and to try to get a handle on what the original excavators found and try to make it intelligible in a modern era for people is an exciting thing,” Manuelian says.
He also emphasizes that it is an honor to follow in Reisner’s footsteps.
“[Reisner] was actually from a time when archaeology was just finding its feet and becoming a discipline and a science with a responsible method, and he was one of the very earliest pioneers,” Manuelian says.
Manuelian, who is currently writing a biography of Reisner, adds that Reisner was one of the first to use methods of documentation like glass-plate negative photography, daily register books, and diaries.
When asked about filling the void that Reisner left behind, Manuelian’s answer is a very humble one.
“I wouldn’t put myself quite at his league,” Manuelian says. “He was really quite a genius on many fronts.”
Manuelian’s colleagues are excited to hear that he has stepped into Reisner’s position at Harvard.
“It is extremely important that Harvard once more has an Egyptologist on its faculty,” says Willeke Z. Wendrich, professor of Egyptian archaeology at the Cotsen Institute of Archaeology at UCLA. “Any serious university, especially one which owns a collection of Egyptian art, should enable students to study and understand the development, unique features and deeply human aspects of ancient cultures.”
Wendrich adds that Manuelian’s work is exciting because of his enormous service to the scholarly community in giving access to the Giza materials online.
“I’m certain the Harvard student population is benefitting greatly from his deep knowledge, unique insights and innovative digital approach,” Wendrich says.
Manuelian stresses that his work in Egyptology is not only beneficial to Harvard students, but benefits society in innumerable ways.
“Any culture you study enriches your own perceptions, to see how you do things in a similar fashion or in a different way, and in many ways studying the ancient Egyptians builds a bridge, a link, to our common humanity,” Manuelian  says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Physics professor Eric Mazur has been recognized internationally for his research program in optical physics as well as his work in science education. The Harvard Crimson interviewed Professor Mazur to find out more about his role as a science educator.
The Harvard Crimson: When did you start getting interested in science education?
Mazur: When I became an assistant professor here at Harvard in 1984, I was asked to teach. Of course, I knew it was going to be part of my job description, so I took my teaching very seriously. However, as is common practice all over the globe, when you teach in higher education, you get absolutely no training—no theories, no coaching, nothing. I based my opinions and my approach on my personal experiences, and my personal experiences were no different from the experiences of many students today—or the experiences of students in the 19th century or in the 16th century; namely, you sit in benches and you listen to a professor, and you take notes, and then you walk away thinking you’ve learned things. I did to my students back in 1984 exactly what my teachers had done to me, naively believing that was how I had learned science. I was devoted to teaching right from the start—I was just incredibly ill informed, unprepared, unqualified, and misguided in my approach, but I think that is no different than anybody else.
THC: When did you start realizing that this teaching style wasn’t working?Mazur: I started having students solve basically two types of problems on exams. One of them was a word based conceptual problem, and the other was a textbook problem on exactly the same subject—and what I found was a true eye opener. Students could do perfectly well on the textbook problem, but on the word-based problem they floundered. They had not internalized the information and they could not deal with it conceptually, but they were able to solve a textbook problem simply by rote, following a prescription. And that’s when I really started grappling with new approaches for teaching. That’s when I had students start learning by questioning and having students ask one another questions.
THC: Can you briefly describe your philosophy and process of teaching?
Mazur: If you train for a marathon, you aren’t doing yourself any good sitting and eating popcorn, watching videos of marathon runners—you’ve got to do the running ... As a student you need to take control of your own learning, and a teacher should really be, in a sense, the coach to put you on the right path and keep you on the right path—and to keep you motivated for wanting to learn. The form that it takes depends largely on the class, the class size, and the class purpose. If it is a really large class, I may ask a short question, and have the students use clickers to first commit individually to an answer, and then debate the answer among themselves. If it is a small class I may have the students teach one another—with me as a coach. The key point here is that the focus is on the student as the learner, and my task is not one of regurgitating information.
THC: How has your research in education merged with your scientific research? How have you managed to do cutting edge research in your field while at the same time making a contribution to educational research and methods?
Mazur: Whenever people ask me that question, I am always a little incredulous, and I think—how can you not do the two things together? After all, if I am a scientist, the main question you ask as a scientist is “why?” I become like a little kid again and I want to understand things and I want to wrap my head around how something works. Yes, the subjects are different, one is the interaction between light and matter and one is the classroom, but this basic curiosity of wanting to understand how things work motivates both.
THC: Do you think that college professors should have to take courses in pedagogy?
Mazur: Absolutely. You want to be a lawyer, you have to pass the bar exam. You want to be a doctor, you have to pass all kinds of exams. You want to teach in a kindergarten, you need to have certification. But if you want, on the other hand, to teach the next generation of leaders—and you want to teach in higher education—simply by virtue of a PhD degree you are supposed to know exactly how to educate people. It just doesn’t make sense.

When Dorrit Cohn ’45 came to Harvard in 1971, the Boston Globe announced: “Harvard University more than doubled the number of female professors on its faculty by appointing six women yesterday.”
Despite the discrimination she sometimes faced as one of the first female academics tenured by Harvard, Cohn, who died earlier this month of complications from Parkinson’s disease, forged a distinguished career in literary scholarship and was remembered this week as an inspiring and inquisitive teacher and friend.
“She wanted to know everything,” said her son Steven Cohn. “Even when she retired, she decided that what she wanted to do most was learn Greek.”
Born Dorrit Zucker-Hale, Cohn left Austria with her family days before Nazi takeover during her childhood. The family eventually made its way to the United States, where Cohn attended high school at New York City’s Lycée Français. There, she learned English, her third language, and embarked upon her lifelong journey of English scholarship. At Radcliffe, however, she decided to major in physics.
“She joked that she wanted to know everything in the world, and physics was the thing that she knew the least about, so why not major in it?” Steven Cohn recalled.
After college, Cohn earned graduate degrees from Yale, Stanford, and Harvard. A lifelong academic, she began her teaching career at Indiana University, where she earned tenure before coming to Harvard in 1971.
“Harvard was a very male place, and breaking through was never that easy,” Steven Cohn said. “In her early years, she had a skiing accident, and she needed a parking place next to Boylston. When she called as herself, she wasn’t given one. The next day, she called and said she was the secretary of a Mr. Cohn—and ‘Mr. Cohn’ was given the parking place immediately.”
Yet Cohn earned her peers’ respect for her scholarship. She was recognized with numerous awards including a Radcliffe Graduate Society Medal in 1982 and Phi Beta Kappa Teaching Award in 1984.
In 2011, the International Society for the Study of Narrative honored her with the Wayne C. Booth Lifetime Achievement Award for her contributions to the field of narrative studies.
“[Her work] was quite an accomplishment considering that English was her third language,” said Irene Kacandes ’80, a professor of German and comparative literature at Dartmouth who studied under Cohn. “She was an elegant and clear writer, and it was wonderfully generous that she shared her skills with her students.”
Harvard comparative literature professor Susan R. Suleiman recalled that Cohn offered warm support far beyond the classroom. “Once she became your friend, you could really be sure that she would always behave in a way that you could really count on,” she said.
Kacandes added, “Teacher, mentor, scholar—she was the very best in the Harvard faculty. I feel incredibly lucky to have studied under her.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mark D. Jordan, a popular professor with appointments at the Harvard Divinity School and Faculty of Arts and Sciences, will leave Harvard at the end of the semester to take a position at the Danforth Center for Religion and Politics at Washington University in St. Louis.
Jordan’s departure comes three years after his arrival at the Divinity School.
While administrators made extensive efforts to keep him at Harvard, Jordan said, he ultimately decided to accept an offer from the Danforth Center.
“In the end, it was a question of what is called ‘fit’—that is, of the very particular correlation between my intellectual trajectory and the present configuration of this complex institution,” he wrote in an email.
Jordan will join former Divinity School professor R. Marie Griffith at the Danforth Center. Griffith now heads the Danforth after leaving Harvard in 2011.
Many of Jordan’s past students expressed disappointment upon learning of his imminent departure, noting that he was a beloved figure among students and other faculty members.
“Mark was a fantastic professor, I think he opened up a world at Harvard that I didn’t know was available,” said Sierra E. Fleenor, a student at Harvard Divinity School who took courses in “Foucault and Religion” and “Negative Theology” with Jordan.
“I had a very transformative experience in his class,” Jia Hui Lee ’12 said. “He will be very missed.”
The first scholar to hold the Niebuhr professorship, Jordan has primarily taught courses specializing in ethics with a focus on Christianity and sexuality.
Students said that Jordan’s departure comes as a hard blow to queer studies at Harvard since Jordan served as a mentor figure for many students interested in the field.
“I know a lot of students flocked to him,” Fleenor said. “His office hours were always full. He filled a niche at Harvard for students who didn’t feel like they had someone to guide them through this inquiry and field of study.”
Some of his students said that Jordan’s leaving indicates a dearth of resources and support for queer studies at the University.
“It is indicative of a lack of institutional support for queer studies and queer life at Harvard, both at the Divinity School and in the Yard. For me that’s a very significant problem,” said Nicholas J. Mendoza, who is a Divinity School student.
“I think it is a loss for Harvard, but I know it’s hard to be the lone ranger in queer studies,” Fleenor said. “Mark made the best decision for himself.”

Protesters gathered in Harvard Square on Thursday to speak out against the handling of a killing in Florida which has sparked a nationwide outcry.
Since the death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin on Feb. 26, a growing coalition has demanded that George Zimmerman, a 28-year-old man who admits to the shooting, be charged with murder. Zimmerman has not been arrested.
Protesters who assembled in front of the main entrance to the Harvard Square T station on Thursday said that the case indicates broader problems in American race relations and legal processes.
“The overwhelming majority of incarcerated people [in this country] are African-American or Hispanic,” said Mark Francis, a junior at Emerson College. “We have to assume people are profiling minorities.”
Protesters with bullhorns led the crowd in call-and-response chants like, “What do we want?” “Justice!” “When do we want it?” “Now!”
Others shouted, “We are Trayvon Martin.”
Zimmerman, who has been alternately described as white and Hispanic, has maintained that he acted in self-defense when he followed and shot the unarmed black teenager.
The case has drawn national attention to Florida’s Stand Your Ground law, which allows a person who believes himself to be in deadly danger to defend himself with lethal force rather than fleeing from the threat. Zimmerman has claimed to have acted under the conditions of this law.
“To allow people to chase someone and shoot them and get away with it—that’s an unfair law,” said Maia J. Cogen, a student at Harvard Law School.
Cristina M. Rodrigues, another law student, said that Zimmerman’s actions should not be protected by the Florida policy. “Even with the [Stand your Ground] law, you aren’t allowed to follow someone and claim self-defense,” she said.
Thursday also saw a demonstration called the “Million Hoodie March” in New York City to demand Zimmerman’s arrest. The Harvard Islamic Society has planned a support table in front of the Science Center for 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Friday intended to draw attention to the case.
The police chief overseeing the investigation into the shooting stepped down Thursday amidst the outcry, and Florida Governor Rick Scott appointed a prosecutor to investigate the murder the same day and declared his intent to appoint a committee to examine the Stand Your Ground law.
The U.S. Department of Justice has also opened an inquiry into the shooting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Google plans to expand its presence in Cambridge, a move that the Cambridge City Council approved on Monday and that computer science professors said might prompt the internet titan to further support Harvard students.
After the City Council approved Google’s plan to remodel its Kendall Square branch, Steve Vinter, who heads the office, said that he was pleased with the decision.
“We’re really appreciative of the enormous amount of work that has been done by the community and the Council and all the other partners involved to make this possible tonight,” he said.
As part of the project, Boston Properties—the real estate investment trust that owns the three buildings that will be renovated—will construct walkway bridges between the properties to allow Google to occupy contiguous space in all three buildings.
When the renovation was proposed in late February, it encountered opposition from some councillors because one of the bridges will displace half of a rooftop garden that is protected by an open spaces covenant.
Boston Properties responded with a revised proposal that included a $2 million pledge to develop a new park on Binney Street to counter the impact of the lost open space. The Council approved the plan on Monday by a vote of 7-2.
“The offerings they made about open space more than make up for the losses,” said Cambridge Mayor Henrietta J. Davis, who voted on Monday to support Google’s expansion. “I think that going forward to the future with Google based here in Cambridge is a great idea.”
David J. Malan ’99, who teaches the crowd-pleasing introductory course Computer Science 50, expressed enthusiasm about Google’s growth in Kendall Square.
“We’re thrilled they’ll be expanding their presence in Cambridge,” Malan wrote in an email.  “These are exciting times for computer science in Cambridge.”
In regard to the effect of Google’s greater presence in Cambridge on Harvard students, Malan added, “Google has been a good friend to CS50 and to CS at Harvard for some time now. Odds are Google’s expansion will mean all the more opportunities for students in the months to come.”
Computer science professor Greg Morrisett said that Google’s expansion in Cambridge is only part of an “explosion” of computer-related businesses in the area—a trend which stands to help Harvard students interested in computer science.
“It’s a great opportunity for everyone,” Morrisett wrote in an email. “For example, we’ve struck partnerships to bring in people from these major companies for help with everything from mentoring to lecturing. That helps inject their wisdom and experience into the classroom.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The self-styled “hottest star from China” extended Harvard men an offer of marriage on Monday—but the choosy husband-hunter said that Asians and those without a Masters degree need not apply.
Luo Yufeng, who gained notoriety in China for passing out flyers petitioning for the perfect spouse and has since moved to New York City, visited Harvard earlier this week to continue her search for a husband—specifically, one who stands between 5.74 and 6.11 feet tall, is between the ages of 25 and 31, and “would like to dominate the world.”
The flyers that Luo distributed in front of Boylston Gate and the Science Center list these qualifications and other stringent marital requirements.
“I need a man handsome, tall, and Master’s degree from Harvard Business School and [works] in a bank,” she wrote in an email to The Crimson which has been edited for punctuation. “Harvard is the best university all over the world, so I think it’s worth to have a try,” she added.
Luo—who has 1.9 million followers on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter—said she was impressed by the Harvard men she met, whom she described as “gentle and polite.” She added that she was particularly taken with “one handsome man outside the Harvard Business School.”
She said she has been contacted by about 50 Harvard students since her visit to Cambridge.
Harvard is only the latest stop in Luo’s quest for Mr. Right. After distributing her first batch of flyers in 2009 in Shanghai, she quickly skyrocketed to fame on the web and on television. For many, her unorthodox pursuit of marriage became an object of ridicule; she was even pelted with an egg while appearing on “China’s Got Talent.”
In 2011, she moved to New York, where she has since passed out flyers at Occupy Wall Street and Columbia University. In total, she said, she has spent more than $10,000 on flyers.
After seeing Luo outside the Science Center, Laura J. Cheng ’15, whose mother hails from the same Chinese city as Luo, said that the flyer reminded her of “stories of young Chinese women who meet white businessmen in Beijing and immediately try to go back with them.”
While many Harvard students ignored the flyers, Jacob S. Miller ’15 replied with a letter of his own. His letter, which he handed to Luo and also posted on Facebook, asked for a wife “Between 525,000 and 39,420,000 minutes old,” a parody of Luo’s exacting demands. “I’d like to think that my letter was about the same level of ridiculousness as hers,” he said.
Although her search has been fruitless so far, she maintains that her requirements are reasonable. “If they are not too poor, I can accept them,” she wrote. “I need a clever man, that is all.”
While Luo admitted that her methods are “not the best way of finding a husband,” she said she was determined to keep trying. “Husband can’t automatically appears if I do nothing.”

Lounging in the sunshine on the Quad lawn on Thursday afternoon, William M. Rafey ’13 had skipped class to listen to a mathematics lecture when he received an email notifying him that he had been named a member of the “Junior 24.”
Phi Beta Kappa announced on Thursday its “Junior 24”—the first 24 members of the Class of 2013 to be elected to the organization’s Harvard’s chapter.
According to Harvard PBK President Logan S. McCarty ’96, who was elected to PBK himself during his time at Harvard, 48 finalists were selected based on their GPA and invited to apply to the organization. Applicants were required to submit two letters of recommendation from professors, and a selection committee then chose among the 48.
PBK considered many factors when making its decision, including breadth of coursework, difficulty of courses taken, and participation in undergraduate research.
“This is a really incredibly talented group of students,” McCarty said. “We see students who are taking six courses in a semester. We see students who are studying three different languages at the same time. It’s really incredible to see the talent of these extraordinary students and trying to make a decision among this group is extremely difficult.”
McCarty said that “all As with maybe two A-minuses was the typical sort of transcript” among candidates.
Juniors who were inducted into PBK unanimously attributed their success to taking classes that interested them across a number of disciplines. Rafey, a Social Studies concentrator, said he has taken courses in eleven different departments. Anthropology concentrator Annmarie E. Ryu ’13 said she seriously considered at least nine different concentrations. And Ann M. Morgan ’13 described her academic career—which has included a concentration in chemistry, courses in physics, and research in biology—as “schizophrenic.”
Julian B. Gewirtz ’13 said that while he was proud to be named a member of PBK, he was even prouder to see his blockmate, Benjamin B. Wilcox ’13, also receive the honor.
“It was really, really cool to see Ben, my blockmate, also get it because I really can’t think of a more deserving person than him,” Gewirtz said. “It’s a nice feeling to be placed in his company.”
Lee C. Seligman ’13 and Allan J. Hsiao ’13, roommates who were both named members of the “Junior 24,” will likely celebrate the honor by taking advantage of Restaurant Week and going out to dinner in Boston, Seligman said.
Members of the Class of 2013 who were not selected in the first round still have two more opportunities to be elected to the society, which will ultimately include 10 percent of the graduating class, according to McCarty.
The 24 juniors inducted into the society on Thursday are Carl Daher, Spencer L. de Mars, Tony L. Feng, Julian B. Gewirtz, Ike I. Greenstein, William P. Grogan, Adam T. Horn, Allan J. Hsiao, Jessica J. Hwang, Jillian J. Jordan, Andrew S. Kennard, Yacoub H. Kureh, Ann M. Morgan, Robert K. Nishihara, Camille S. Owens, William M. Rafey, Annmarie E. Ryu, Lee C. Seligman, Kevin M. Stone, William J. Sun, Sivakumar S. Sundaram, Emily S. Unger, Benjamin B. Wilcox, and Alexa K. Zahl.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Matt Birk ’98 was growing up in St. Paul, Minn., his family made faith, family, friends, and education their top priorities.
Not much has changed.
Sure, Birk has moved from Minnesota to Maryland, become a six-time Pro Bowler, and, most recently, been named the 2011 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year; but his community of friends, focus on faith, and commitment to education have remained the same.
“It’s not difficult to hang around people who you share a lot of the same values with,” said Jim Runyon, Birk’s lifelong friend and classmate at their high school, Cretin-Derham Hall. “Everyone is still very humble, still very down to earth. They have the same values they had 20, 30 years ago.”
Birk’s Catholic upbringing and his family’s focus on education have inspired the center’s work at his HIKE Foundation, which promotes literacy among at-risk children in the Baltimore area.
“When I talk to kids, my message is always education,” he said. “What’s more basic than reading?”
It was a message Birk and his brothers received from an early age as part of a St. Paul community that emphasized family and education.
“It started with parents who believed that education was the backbone of any good future and good family,” Runyon said of growing up in St. Paul. “It wasn’t something you talked about as much as something you did.”
Birk and his HIKE Foundation now work in areas that need that kind of talk. And he earned the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award because he has made those schoolchildren and their families listen.
“He’s very selfless,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “He realizes that he lives a very privileged life, but he doesn’t feel entitled.”
THE HARVARD DAYS
Birk left Minnesota as a standout athlete from Cretin-Derham Hall—a high school that also boasts Baseball Hall of Famer Paul Molitor and Twins catcher and 2009 MVP Joe Mauer.
“Once I was able to focus just on football, I was able to improve, to train more, to train smarter, [and] to put more effort into it” said Birk, who also competed in basketball and track in high school. “I had some great coaching along the way...I was like a hungry dog and they just kept feeding me.”
While Birk improved throughout his four years at Harvard, his biggest jump came between his junior and senior years.
“He started his junior year, had a rocky year, and was probably 6’5”, 275 [pounds]. He  came back his senior year at 300 pounds and dominated—simply dominated,” remembered Colby Skelton ’98, Birk’s teammate and blockmate who later moved to St. Paul.
Murphy concurred that Birk was the conference’s dominant player that season, adding that his position, offensive tackle, kept him from garnering more attention.
But Birk’s command of the line of scrimmage was enough to catch the eye of the Vikings, who drafted him in the sixth round of the 1998 NFL Draft with the 173rd pick.
And so the Harvard grad returned home to the Twin Cities, his home state unaware of the draft steal it had acquired.
RETURN OF THE VI-KING
When Birk returned home to Minnesota, his new team was all set at the line of scrimmage, leaving the Harvard alum to spend two years on the bench.
It proved to be a perfect scenario.
“When I got there, they weren’t relying on me to play right away,” Birk said. “There were some great offensive linemen who I could learn from—learn the game from, and learn how to be a professional football player.”
When Birk did get his shot on the gridiron, he quickly established himself as one of the top linemen in the league and earned a trip to the Pro Bowl in his first year as a starter, and Minnesota reached the NFC Championship that season.
“He’s very athletic,” Murphy said. “He’s smart in a football sense. He seamlessly made the transition from tackle to center.”
“They pulled the center a lot,” Birk noted of Minnesota’s offense. “For my size, I was fairly athletic. That scheme fit my skill set pretty well.”
Birk made the Pro Bowl every year from 2000 to 2004, and after missing the 2005 season with a hip injury, he bounced back with two more Pro-Bowl selections in 2006 and 2007 and was named an alternate in 2008.
But Birk’s emergence as a dominant player in the NFL didn’t shift his core values. Instead, Birk’s commitment to his family and community complemented his persona as a hard working football player, and Birk founded the HIKE Foundation in 2002.
“[Birk’s loyalty] starts with his upbringing, with his parents who are wonderful, wonderful people and his friends who are wonderful guys, who he is loyal to and they are equally loyal to him,” Skelton said. “He has his priorities in the right order..., and it shines through.”
The Vikings certainly took notice and named him the team’s Man of the Year for six straight years. Birk also earned the Ed Block Courage Award in 2006.
GOOD MORNING, BALTIMORE
After 11 years in Minnesota, Birk signed a three-year $12 million deal with Baltimore Ravens in 2009.
“Matt has done a great job and we wanted him to return to the Vikings in ’09, but at this point Matt wanted a change of scenery,” then-coach Brad Childress said at the time according to The MinnesotaSCORE. “We wish him the best and know that he will always be a part of the Vikings family.”
Since signing Birk, the Ravens have advanced to the playoffs in all three years, making it to the divisional round in 2009 and 2010 and falling one missed field goal short of a trip to the Super Bowl in 2011. And Birk and the Baltimore offensive line have helped running back Ray Rice emerge as one of the top backs in the league. Rice earned All-Pro and Pro-Bowl selections in both 2009 and 2011 and finished the 2011 season as second in the NFL.
And Birk won over his teammates once again and was named the team’s Man of the Year in 2009 and 2011.
“We have great chemistry,” Birk said of the Ravens. “Guys really enjoy playing with each other. We feel grateful to be on that team. It’s going to be good for a long time.”
There had been rumors that Birk might retire after the 2011 season, and the center confessed that he was weighing his options in the month following the season, saying “I’m using this month to just relax and slow down, figure out what is the next move”, but on March 16 he signed another three-year contract with Baltimore.
QUOTH THE RAVEN
Returning to the work that earned Birk the 2012 Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, it seems fitting that the center received the honor for his literacy promotion during his time the Ravens, a team that takes its name from the poem by Edgar Allan Poe.
“The void was bigger in Baltimore than it was in the Twin Cities,” said Jeff Ginn, executive director of the HIKE Foundation (which stands for Hope, Inspiration, Knowledge, and Education) . “It was a great opportunity for the foundation.”
Matt Birk’s HIKE Foundation, as it is formally known, partners with school districts to achieve its goal of promoting reading.
“Teachers already have more on their plate than they’ve ever had,” Ginn explained. “Really what we are is a gap-filler.”
Birk’s ability to connect, both with the schools and their students, doesn’t surprise his good friends.
“He was just a great guy, always fun, always had a smile on his face,” Runyon said of growing up with Birk.
“He’s a very passionate, gregarious, energetic speaker,” Skelton added. “He can strike a chord with the younger generation.”
The HIKE Foundation strikes this chord through its two programs, Ready, Set, Read! and Read and Rise.
Ready, Set, Read! operates by giving children incentives, such as gift cards and Ravens tickets, to read.
“Our Ready, Set, Read! program encourages kids to read outside of school,” Birk said. “We get them in the habit of reading books for pleasure, and they’re recognized in their school…. We select one student, and we take them down to the stadium. We have lunch and give them a behind-the-scenes tour.”
Read and Rise, meanwhile, partners with Scholastic books to ensure that children have books of their own.
“It brings Scholastic book fairs to low income schools that otherwise wouldn’t have them,” Birk said. “All these kids get vouchers. They can go to the book fair and purchase up to five books. They can purchase books they want, and they have ownership. We invited the families or whomever the child is living with, we have a dinner, and we also have workshop on tips on encouraging their kids to read, developing strong reading skills. The goal is the same [as Ready, Set, Read!] to get kids reading at the youngest age possible.”
At the heart of the mission is the belief that children will read if they have the opportunity to read about things they enjoy.
“They will read the things that they find appealing and are drawn to,” Ginn said.
Ginn added that by the end of the school year the HIKE Foundation will have “put over 30,000 books in the hands of just over 10,000 kids.”
And none of it would be possible without Birk’s dedication.
“He should be the poster boy for the NFL about how to do things the right way, to do them with excellence and compassion,” Ginn said. “His passion, his vision for wanting to make a mark on education, it’s been incredible.”
“Matt understands his role isn’t just to be a football player,” Runyon added. “He understands ‘I’m in a position I’m not going to be in forever.’ He’s going to make the most of every situation. He’s done that.... Matt realized football’s for 14-15 years of his life. What he does for those kids is forever.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For most of us here at Harvard, the week following Spring Break is the time when we reluctantly set aside our fond vacation memories and begin tackling the work we face for the second half of the semester.
For the Radcliffe heavyweights, Spring Break’s end marks the end of winter training and the beginning of the long and grueling spring rowing season.
This Saturday, the Black and White heavyweights will host their first regatta of the spring season on the Charles River against local schools including MIT, Boston University, Boston College, and Northeastern in the 6th Annual Beanpot Regatta. As in several years past, Radcliffe held winter training in Florida and returned well-conditioned to face the challenges of the spring season.
“We had a really great time in Florida,” junior rower Scout Moran said. “We enjoyed all of the time we were able to spend on the water and it was also an awesome opportunity for us to get to know the freshmen and have some team bonding.”
Unlike previous season in which the Beanpot was featured near the end of the Black and White’s regular season, this year the regatta will serve as the season opener. Despite this switch up in scheduling, the Radcliffe heavyweights are excited about the opportunity presented.
“Typically the Beanpot is our end-of-season race, but this year it’s in the beginning,” senior coxswain Jill Carlson said. “In every Beanpot, all of the Boston schools bring their best competition to the Charles, so this year it’s going to be a great opportunity for us to get some early season racing experience for the entire team.”
In last year’s regatta, the Black and White continued its dominance of the local competition, with the 1V and 2V boats each finishing first to capture the squad’s fourth Beanpot title.
During last year’s varsity eight race, Radcliffe quickly distanced itself from the field, opening up a sizeable gap from the very beginning. By the race’s end, the Black and White 1V had eviscerated its opponents, winning by 8.1 seconds. The 2V finished even farther ahead of its field, winning with a commanding 12.8-second lead.
Yet despite its historic command of the Charles against local foes, Radcliffe remains cautiously optimistic of its chances this weekend.
“We’ve put in a lot of training and preparation for the Beanpot, but you don’t know what you are going to get until you are on the starting line,” Moran said. “We have a lot of respect for our competition, so we are just going to race our hardest this weekend. That’s all we can do, since we can’t control the speed of the other boats.”
Looking forward to Saturday’s first test of the spring season, the Black and White looks to build upon its success during the fall season.
In its fall regattas, Radcliffe took second at the Head of the Housatonic, second at the Head of the Charles, and first at the Foot of the Charles. At the Head of the Charles, the Black and White emerged as the top Ivy boat to finish in the marquee Championship Eights, coming in seconds behind winners UVA.
“Our races in the fall were really exciting,” Moran said. “We had some awesome wins which have really motivated us during winter training. We’ve been working throughout winter to get faster and to make up the margin between us and other teams.”
After the Beanpot, Radcliffe will face a string of Ivy challenges on the road, beginning with a head-to-head race against Brown in Providence, R.I., later this month.
“[Ivy] teams in general are really fast and fierce, which makes it more exciting to race against them,” Moran said. “In our upcoming race against Brown, both sides have some really strong eights, so we are going to have some really tight racing.”
In April, the Black and White will line up against the triple threat of Columbia, Cornell, and Princeton for the Class of 1975 Cup in Princeton, N.J., and later against Dartmouth and Yale at the O’Leary Cup and Case Cup, respectively.
Radcliffe heavyweights will conclude their regular season in Columbus, Ohio, against the highly-touted UVA and Ohio State squads.
“We are really looking forward to racing both UVA and OSU,” Moran said. “We don’t normally race UVA during our regular season, but this is going to be a great opportunity for all of us to travel as a team. And if you ask anyone on the team they’ll tell you that they are just so stoked to race against both of these teams.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Wednesday, four Harvard seniors began a job search a little different from that of their classmates. Football players Kevin Murphy, Collier Winters, Josue Ortiz, and former captain Alex Gedeon, participated in an NFL Pro Day at Boston College.
The quartet joined 28 other prospects with ties to the state of Massachusetts working out inside BC’s Alumni Stadium bubble in Chestnut Hill, Mass. Evaluating the group was a collection of NFL scouts and coaches from 27 NFL teams, who put the players through a battery of physical and mental tests.
The exercise program performed by the players consisted of bench press, vertical jump, running tests, an intelligence examination, and various individual positional workouts.
Given the dearth of national exposure for most FCS football programs, the opportunity for a Harvard player to display his talents in front of so many representatives of professional teams might happen only once or twice in a career.
“When you know you have a chance to show what you’ve got, you just want to do the best you possibly can,” Murphy said. “Fractions of seconds and inches can make or break you.”
ESPN’s NFL DraftTracker projects none of Harvard’s graduating players to be selected in this April’s NFL Draft, though Murphy is listed on the website as a free agent prospect and considered “worthy of a shot to compete during training camp.”
But the group is certainly not without accolades; all four earned  first- or second-team All-Ivy honors, and three were honored as All-New  England selections.
“Harvard’s program has made us into the athletes and hard workers we  are today,” Murphy said. “I feel like that definitely showed  [Wednesday].”
Last year, the Crimson sent five players to BC’s Pro Day. Of that  group, only safety Collin Zych and offensive lineman Brent Osborne  signed contracts with NFL teams—with the Cowboys and Seahawks,  respectively—though neither made the final 53-man roster. Classmate  Marco Iannuzzi currently plays for the British Columbia Lions of the  Canadian Football League.
Though these accomplishments might not appear as glamorous as some  athletes’ professional aspirations, Murphy recognized just how scarce  such chances are.
“If I have the opportunity to play anywhere, I’d be so happy,” Murphy  said. “Going in, you’re going to be at the bottom of the food chain.  The same thing happened in college—you show up as a freshman and have to  earn respect.”
At present, Harvard has two alumni on NFL rosters: the Buffalo Bills’ Ryan Fitzpatrick and Matt Birk of the Baltimore Ravens.
“The sophistication of professional scouting makes it so [scouts]  don’t care where you come from,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Once  you’ve got some players from your school established in the NFL, there’s  no question it gives them the motivation to look at players you’ve  recommended.”
Despite his players’ unlikely odds of securing an NFL roster spot,  Tim Murphy subscribes to an old maxim when dispensing career advice: you  never know until you try.
“The first thing I say to [players] if I think they’re legitimate pro  prospects is to go for it,” Tim Murphy said. “You get the rest of your  life to work. Like anything else, you should follow your dream.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Long walks around Legoland and Disney World, intense blowgun fights, bike rides along Venice Beach and crashing in Tommy Lee Jones’ private barn—perhaps not how you would have expected Crimson athletes to spend their spring breaks. But when we caught up with some of Harvard’s spring season athletes, we found that most of them were able to enjoy a mixture of business and pleasure over last week’s recess.
While crew endured two-a-day practices on the Charles, many Crimson teams chose to compete on the road. Men’s volleyball, men’s tennis, women’s water polo and softball all hit up California for the break, while the polo team and baseball chose to take advantage of the Sunshine State. And that’s just to name a few.
And when they weren’t busy slamming balls over nets or deep into centerfield, most of the teams kept pretty entertained.
“We had two days off in the middle of the week,” said softball’s sophomore infielder Kasey Lange. “We went to the beach a lot and got to ride bikes along Venice Beach.”
The men’s volleyball team, also in California, chose to employ their free time in a slightly different manner.
“For $8.39 we got twelve lengths of PVC pipe, half inch in diameter, the perfect diameter for blowgun fights with NERF whistle darts,” explained men’s volleyball sophomore Nick Madden. The team divided Madden’s California home by floor and faced off in a 7-on-7 battle to the death (well technically to the second death as each player got two lives). The game “obviously” ranged outdoors and indoors with “window screens optional, so those came off pretty early.”
But although it may seem like just fun and games, NERF gun fights are clearly serious business for Madden.  “There’s a lot of strategy involved. Headshots were frowned upon but allowed…. We also had additional backup weapons in case it came to close combat. Nightfinders were a primary backup weapon in close quarters because they have a little scope on it with a red dot that you can aim on opponents’ faces.”
And when they weren’t hitting each other with NERF guns the volleyball boys were cheering on their fellow Harvard athletes.
Men’s volleyball and the softball team were both playing at Northridge on March 10th so the guys showed up to cheer the girls on to a 5-2 victory.
Meanwhile on the other side of the country the baseball team was being dragged out of bed by its coach to go to…Disney World?
Actually they were watching spring training, but once that was over they spent an hour and a half driving around Disney World looking for a restaurant to eat breakfast.
“Eventually we ended right back up where we started, so we just ate at some fast food place by Legoland,” freshman  Mike Martin said. “Then our coach decided we should walk around Legoland for another hour before we went to play.”
While the baseball team got a peek at Disney World, several members of the men’s and women’s polo team were getting an exclusive look at Tommy Lee Jones’ private barn.
“He is the benefactor for the Harvard polo team,” sophomore Danielle Lussi explained. “So every year he donates money or some of his older horses, and every year he invites some of us to his ranch to play or for training.”
While in the past only the men’s team has gone, this year both teams sent representatives, so Lussi was joined by Jane Amero, Marina Lehner, Albany Mulholland, and Shawn DeMartino staying in the grooms’ quarters and riding the famous actor’s horses.
“He has two very simple barns,” reported Lussi, “not ostentatious, not elaborate, just very efficient.”
The team also got a chance to watch quite a bit of professional polo, including some matches played by Adolfo Cambiaso, currently the top-ranked polo player in the world.
But unfortunately, the break is over, and Harvard student athletes must exchange NERF guns for books, bike rides to Venice Beach for bike rides to the Quad, and hours spent in Legoland for hours in Lamont.
Thankfully, most students can return with a spring in their step and enough memories to tide them over until summertime.

For poor college students looking for another way to save money and have fun in Boston for free, the library probably isn't the first place they'd think to go. It should be.
A program sponsored by the Boston Public Library allows library card holders to reserve donated passes to museums and other attractions around Boston. They can use them for one day before returning them to the library for someone else to use—sounds like borrowing a book, right? The passes can be reserved ahead of time, and must be picked up from the library either the day of or the day before their use. Any student in the Boston area can get a library card, including Harvard students!
Many of these passes cover admission for multiple people, giving an awesome excuse to break out of the Harvard bubble with friends. Institutions participating in the free or discounted admission program include: the New England Aquarium, the New England Zoo, the Institute of Contemporary Art, the Museum of Science, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Children's Museum, and many more locations around Boston.
Go nuts. The seals are beckoning.

Crimson gets the bronze! Just when we thought Harvard Law School was number one, U.S. News & World Report ranked Harvard third in their 2013 Best Law Schools rankings released earlier this month. Last year, Stanford ranked third and Harvard, second; the two schools switched rankings this year, with Yale remaining in first place.
The Harvard Law Record proposed that Stanford either increased its "Selectivity" score or received higher marks than Harvard in other categories.
Yale Law School, which doesn't give grades to its students, has been ranked first since 1990.
While the Quacquarelli Symonds World University Rankings by subject, which ranked HLS first this year, considers academic reputation, employer reputation, and citations per paper, U.S. News & World Report's analysis considers a weighted average of 12 measures of quality that include an assessment score by lawyers and judges, median LSAT scores, acceptance rates, and job placement success.
If you get into Harvard Law and are rejected from Yale Law, though, do not fret. U.S. News & World Report detailed that while 88.9 percent of Yale Law students are employed at graduation, 92.0 percent of Harvard Law students have secured jobs by commencement.

March 22, 1924: John Harvard Statue To Move to New Position Before University Hall
Action has been taken by the Corporation of the College to have the statue of John Harvard removed from its present site on the Delta, west of Memorial Hall, to a position on the west side of University Hall, where the bronze, map of the Yard at present stands. No definite time has been set for moving the statue, but it is expected that the work will be completed by the middle of May.

March 21, 1929: Tenements Fall To Make Room for House Units
Work on the razing of two wooden tenement houses in the block between De Wolfe and Plympton Streets is now under way, it was announced yesterday by A. L. Endicott '94, comptroller of the University. One of these houses is already nearly demolished and the wrecking crew yesterday began work on the other.
These buildings, with others abutting on Plympton Street below Mt. Auburn Street, have been owned by the University for a number of years. Before Soldier's Field was used to such an extent as today and before the Freshman dormitories were built, this region was one of the most unattractive in Cambridge. The destruction of these houses, both of cheap construction, marks one more step in the University's attempt in recent years to clean up the district, since the expansion of the College in that direction.
March 21, 1946: Buckeyes Whip Crimson Quintet in NCAA Tournament Game
NEW YORK—At 9:27 o'clock tonight any hopes for bringing a national championship to Cambridge faded into history, as Floyd Stahl's Varsity quintet finished on the short end of a 46-38 score in the N.C.A.A. Eastern semi-final contest with Ohio State before some 18,000 cynical fans in Madison Square Garden.
March 23, 1976: Hum 103 and Ec 10 Lead List of Popular Courses
The University's introductory economics course is no longer the most heavily subscribed course, according to spring-term figures released yesterday by the Office of the Registrar.
Humanities 103, "The Great Age of Athens," heads the list with 799 students enrolled, and Economics 10, "Principles of Economics," is second with 782 students.
March 23, 1979: Students Tackle Cheesecake Challenge
For the last two years David Rowinsky, the owner of Rowinsky's cake shop on Mt. Auburn St., has bet $25 that no one can have one of his five-pound cheesecakes and eat it in one hour, too.
So far, over 100 people have tried it but only four have proved him wrong.

Most of us—most—will never be selected to participate in the Hunger Games. Luckily for everyone else, there's still a higher calling to represent our Districts in a nobler and less lethal sport: the Drinking Games. So if you go to see "The Hunger Games" movie, pull a Haymitch and keep those drinks coming throughout the festivities.
Whenever anyone salutes with three fingers, toast the screen.
If Peeta touches Katniss awkwardly, take a drink.
Whenever Gale watches Peeta touch Katniss awkwardly on the screen, take a drink.
Take a sip if someone says something insensitive about District 12.
Whenever a child dies a horrible death in the arena, drink up.
Whenever Haymitch takes a drink, take a drink.
If someone says, "May the odds be ever in your favor," then take a sip. (Take it easy on this one.)
Whenever Effie fills or creates an awkward silence, take a drink.
Whenever Caesar Flickerman smiles, drink up.
Every time you feel like this movie is far too disturbing for a young adult audience, drink up.
There can only be one victor: The weak will pass out, while the champion revels in relative sobriety. May the odds be ever in your favor (that's a drink).
