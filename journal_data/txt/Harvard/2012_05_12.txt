After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Most members of the Harvard men’s tennis team only just finished finals, but for each of them, the real test starts now.
Following one of the best regular seasons in its history, the No. 23 Crimson (22-2, 6-1 Ivy) will face No. 45 Virginia Tech (11-11, 7-4 ACC) in the first round of the NCAA tournament tomorrow in Gainesville, Fla.
The match will mark the Harvard’s return to the tournament after a four-year hiatus. The team last participated in the NCAAs in 2008, when it dropped a 4-2 decision to Texas Tech.
But this year, expectations are greater than ever for the Crimson, which reached as high as No. 16 in the ITA rankings during the regular season and has already beaten the Hokies once this year.
That victory came on Feb. 11 in Cambridge, when Harvard held off its ACC opponent, 4-3. The Crimson won the match thanks to its doubles play, as Harvard swept all three matches to earn the doubles point. Because of that success, the Crimson has been putting extra focus on its doubles teams as it prepares for its rematch with the Hokies, who are coming off a first-round ACC tournament loss to No. 33 Florida State.
“Doubles play is key,” said freshman Denis Nguyen, who with junior Andy Nguyen beat Virginia Tech’s Lucas Oliveira and Hunter Koontz last time out. “It will be very important for us to get an early advantage and help us stay confident in the match.”
“We’re focusing a lot on doubles,” senior Jonathan Pearlman added. “We want to make sure to come out strong in doubles play, because in the end that could be the decider.”
That was the case last time, when the Hokies and Crimson split the singles matches 3-3. Pearlman, Harvard’s No. 1, fell to Virginia Tech’s Luka Somen, 6-1, 6-2.
Ranked the No. 48 collegiate player in the country, Somen picked up a dominant win last month against No. 24 Kevin King of Georgia Tech and finished 15-6 in the first spot this year. But Pearlman, who is 11-10 as Harvard’s No. 1 this season, thinks he can handle the senior this time around.
“[Somen] is a very strong player, but he’s beatable,” Pearlman said. “He’s a very good defensive player. Balls that would normally be finished or balls that I would hit and the point would normally be over, he retrieves. I’m just going to need to be prepared for long rallies, but I’m still going to bring an aggressive game and I think I have a good chance in this match.”
If Pearlman can pull the upset, it would alleviate some of the pressure on the other Crimson singles players, including Denis Nguyen and classmate Henry Steer, who both lost to their Hokie opponents last time out. 
“We know they’re a really good team to compete against, so we know it’s going to be a battle,” said Nguyen, who two weekends ago, with his team tied 3-3, clinched the outright Ivy title for Harvard by rallying back to win the final two sets against Dartmouth’s Michael Laser.
According to Nguyen—who went 12-5 from Harvard’s No. 2 spot this year and was named to the All-Ivy second team as a rookie—one key to a win will be to avoid playing things safe during the course of the match.
“We’ve been playing pretty tight our last couple of matches,” he explained. “We need to play on our own terms and actually play to win, rather than to protect a lead.”
To be able to do just that, Harvard has not stopped working since it won its 29th-ever Ivy title by topping the Big Green, 4-3, on April 28.
“We’ve been practicing very hard these last two weeks since we beat Dartmouth,” said Pearlman, who last week was named first-team All-Ivy for the second consecutive season. “Everyone’s been really bringing everything to practice in the last 10, 12 days, so everyone’s very sharp and looking good going into this. Obviously it’s going to be a tough match. They’re a very strong team as well.”
If the Crimson can use that extra practice to knock off the Hokies, it would advance to play the winner of No. 11 Florida and Navy on the Gators’ home courts in the second round of the 64-team tournament on Sunday. The last time Harvard—which is 13-20 all-time in 21 NCAA tournament appearances—reached the NCAA quarterfinals was 1997, when it was shutout by No. 3 Stanford. Getting back to that point with the chance to avenge that loss is a feat the team is hoping to achieve this time around.
“We want to win these first two rounds and make it to the round of 16,” Pearlman said. “That’s the team goal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yes, co-captain Rachel Brown was her dominant self Friday, and yes, sophomore slugger Kasey Lange’s hit led to the only run in Game 1 of the Ivy League Championship Series against Penn.
But those facts obscure the general picture.
The Harvard softball team claimed its second straight Ivy League title on Friday at Soldiers Field not because of any one dominant performance but thanks to a total team effort. In a sweep of Penn by scores of 1-0 and 5-2, the conference champion's depth proved too much for the visiting Quakers to handle.
HARVARD 5, PENN 2
After being held to one run in Game 1, the Harvard offense responded from top to bottom in the series-clinching second game. Nine Crimson hitters recorded a total of 12 hits off Quaker pitcher Alexis Borden, who led the league in ERA.
”This team has done an unbelievable job of playing whatever role they can play to help the team win—however big, however small,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “It shows that this team is 21 strong.”
No player embodied that mentality more than junior Stephanie Regan. Regan hadn’t played in three weeks since being sidelined with a knee injury and still wasn’t healthy enough to play the field. But coming back Friday as the designated hitter, she collected a single in the first inning and was immediately replaced by a pinch runner. In her second at-bat, which didn’t come until the sixth inning, Regan hit a ball to left that scored one and usually would have given her at least a double, but the injured runner instead hobbled into first before being removed from the game for the final time.
On the day, three other hitters tallied RBIs, as freshman Adrienne Hume scored one in the third with a walk before co-captain Whitney Shaw drove another home with a sac fly in the following at-bat. Hume pushed Harvard’s lead to three with a single in the fifth, and Lange added a run with a single in the sixth before scoring on Regan’s single.
On the mound, sophomore Laura Ricciardone was mimicking Regan, fighting through pain to help her team achieve its second straight Ivy title. Ricciardone hadn’t pitched since leaving the mound with a twisted ankle two weeks ago. Her rust didn’t show Friday, though, as she held Penn to three hits and two runs—both unearned—in five innings of work. One of those runs came in the fifth on an error, and the other came on a groundout after the runner had taken third base on a wild pitch.
“She was a total champ,” Brown said. “We all knew she was in pain although she wouldn’t show it. She is one of the toughest competitors I’ve ever played with, so it was incredible to see her do what she did.”
Ricciardone wasn’t able to register a complete game due to a comebacker that struck her squarely in her leg. She attempted to pitch again but was pulled from the game. Brown came back in to finish the series off.
“It’s fun to be on the field when you win the championship series, but Laura was pitching really strong, so it was a shame that she had to come out,” Brown said. “I really wanted to finish the game strong for her because she had pitched her heart out.”
HARVARD 1, PENN 0
When the Ivy League’s two best pitchers, Borden and Brown, faced off against each other in Game 1 of the Ivy League Championship Series, a low-scoring pitchers’ duel was guaranteed. Both pitchers matched expectations, making no mistakes and holding opposing hitters to a combined six hits. In the end, it would be the defenses behind the two aces that made the difference.
Through five innings, both offenses had combined to collect just three hits, but the Crimson attack finally broke through in the bottom of the sixth. The offense was afforded a golden opportunity when Borden walked the first two batters in the inning, and Lange quickly took advantage.
After a strikeout by sophomore Shelbi Olson, Lange hit a weak ball up the middle that just got by the pitcher. Penn second basemen Samantha Erosa then attempted to get senior Jane Alexander out at second, but her toss sailed past the shortstop, allowing junior Ashley Heritage to score from third.
That error proved costly. One run was all the Crimson needed, as the Harvard pitching and defense remained flawless in sealing the 1-0 win.
“I had total confidence and belief in this team that we were going to win. We had been there before, and we had experience playing in important games, and I thought it was only a matter of time before we would score,” Brown said. “I was definitely nervous, but I had no doubt that my team would pull through.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard softball team completed one of its group goals Friday by claiming a second straight title. But that wasn’t the only accomplishment achieved by the squad this year. Two weeks prior to the team’s triumph over Penn, in a 10-0 victory over Holy Cross, Senior Mari Zumbro came in and played catcher for a perfect seventh inning. It was the ninth position she had played for the Crimson, completing her tour around the diamond.
“We had that on our radar screen,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “That’s something she brought to our attention at end of her junior year. She had played seven out of the nine positions, and the two positions left were second base and catcher. We put her in at second base against Yale, and at Holy Cross we put her in at catcher.”
During the final stages of the quest, the team was becoming as excited as Zumbro about completing the challenge.
“We want to help them achieve their goals,” Allard said. “The team was supportive. We’ve never had anyone ever do that.”
Moving around the diamond isn’t new for Zumbro, as she’s basically been preparing for her role as a super utilitywoman her whole life.
“When I was younger, I played different sports so I really like getting to change things up,” Zumbro said. “I never played one sport year round. So I like to find ways to make softball more interesting.”
By the time Zumbro was halfway through high school, she had already spent significant time at shortstop, catcher and pitcher.
At Harvard, Zumbro showed flexibility beyond the diamond as she filled in as an emergency goalie for the women’s soccer team after two of their goalies were injured.
“I had played not super competitive and I know the rules, and the next thing I know I’m driving with them to Yale,” Zumbro said. “It was awesome.”
“She just loves to play,” Allard said. “Whether it be soccer, softball, she just loves to get out there and play the game.”
Among the softball positions, Zumbro said that outfield was among her favorites.
“In center they actually hit a fly ball to me, which was unlikely but really exciting,” Zumbro said. “I really like the idea of outfield because you can make some of the most amazing plays in terms of web gems.”
Yet, she also said she enjoyed pitching because she was involved in every play.
“They are all really fun,” she decided.

Every week, The Crimson publishes a selection of articles that were printed in our pages in years past.
Saturday, May 9, 1891: Courses for Teachers on "Methods of Instruction"
The announcement of the courses to be given for the benefit of teachers  during the new academic year is now in press, and will soon appear.  The  plan has been already mentioned in these columns, and some further  particulars are at present forthcoming.
At its last meeting, then, the  Faculty of Arts and Sciences decided to offer, during the academic year  1891-92, a series of courses, open to men who are graduates of Colleges  or Scientific Schools, and "to others of suitable age and attainments"   (under the same conditions as those which now govern admission to the  Graduate School).  These are to be called "Courses in Methods of  Instruction adapted to the purposes of teachers, and of persons  intending to become teachers."
Thursday, May 7, 1925: ANNIVERSARIES OF HATRED
Ten years ago today the Lusitania was sunk by a German submarine.   America needed just that shock to force active participation in the  world war.  The bitter wave of hatred which followed in the wake of this  calamity swept America forward to the rescue of the Allied nations.  It  was for is great cause.
But ten years is a long time; in that  space wrongs may be righted and insults avenged.  In spite of French  suspicious. Germany today is a very prostrate, and a very humble nation.   The spirit of militarism has died an enforced death.
Tuesday, May 8, 1945: Veterans Will Not Crowd University, Conant Asserts
With the official announcement of final victory in Europe expected  hourly, President James B. Conant said yesterday that the time for  celebration and relaxation of effort had not yet come.  "We have put  over only two strikes," said President Conant, "and we must look ahead  to the difficulties of the war against Japan."
Although the work  of the National Defense Research Committee, of which he is chairman,  will continue until the end of the Pacific struggle, President Conant  disclosed that with the war in Europe coming to a close he has been able  to give more and more time to this duties at the University.
Wednesday, May 8, 1963: 14 Arrested At Princeton as 1500 Rio
Princeton University officials have threatened to take "serious  disciplinary action" against Tiger undergraduates who lost their  identification cards or were arrested during a two-and-a-half-hour riot  which ended early yesterday morning.
An estimated 1500 students  took part in the spontaneous riot, described as the worst at Princeton  in the last ten years.  Borough police arrested 14 and charged them with  "participation in riotous behavior and damage to property not their  own."  Damage to University and local property may run to several  thousands of dollars.
Monday, May 10, 1976: Bab-O, Brooms, and Toilet Bowls
First stop is Thayer Hall basement:  Headquarters.  Tacked up on the  wall behind and above the head of the porter captain with the watchful  eyes, there is a sign that reads:  THOU SHALT NOT DRAG THE VACUUM  CLEANERS.  The captain sports an understandable frown considering the  hour, "It's only eight o'clock," he says.  "I have a nine o'clock class,  wanna get it over with," the student porter answers.  "You're supposed  to work two hours in a row, it's not good to split it up like this." "I  know." says the student porter as the captain signs him in.  "You're  liable to wake someone up, ya know."
The student porter does not  respond to this.  Instead he heads for the equipment room to pick up the  tools of his trade.  Two hours anytime between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., five  days a week.  Ten hours at $3.75 an hour.  $37.50 a week.  The student  porter knows the rules, the facts and figures, well enough.  This job is  helping to put him through school.

Apparently a chaste activity does exist that is analogous to sex: talking about oneself. A recent series of studies conducted by Harvard neuroscientist and Associate Professor Jason P. Mitchell (who taught SLS 20 in 2010) and psychology student at the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Diana I. Tamir found that self-disclosure activates the same regions of the brain that are associated with food, money, and sex.
According to Mitchell and Tamir, 30 to 40 percent of human speech involves informing others of one's "own subjective experiences," meaning talking about oneself. That's right, we may think we're all great listeners, but we're really spending almost half of our time talking about our opinions on a subject or a telling a story in which we are the protagonist. Mitchell and Tamir conducted a series of five studies in order to determine why we love conversing about ourselves above all other topics.
The studies revealed that we will often go to comic lengths to avoid talking about others and to keep the focus of the conversation on ourselves. In some of their tests, Mitchell and Tamir even offered participants money to talk about other people, such as President Obama. Financial incentives, however, did not prove powerful enough to prevent people from revealing personal information, such as whether or not they liked pizza.
The neuroscientists monitored the brain activity of some participants and observed that when these participants talked about themselves there was increased activity in the mesolimbic dopamine system, the same area of the brain that experiences increased activity during sex.
Apparently, long-winded stories about your last trip to the Delphic can be just as enjoyable as how that night might have ended. Next time you find yourself completely annoyed at a friend for being too self-involved, remember: it's just part of his brain chemistry.
