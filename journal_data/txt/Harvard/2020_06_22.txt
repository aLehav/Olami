After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An Open Letter to the Ballet Community:
Do better. Please.
If the rest of the world has a long way to go, we as an industry are laughably behind. The recent events concerning the senseless deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and countless others have shown the world that we need massive, transformative change when it comes to race relations. For an art form built up among aristocrats with a history of exclusivity and racism, this should have been, and must be, a major warning bell.
Yet as America erupted in pain and outrage, the ballet world failed to react. While statements of solidarity came quickly from a select few major companies (including Pacific Northwest Ballet and American Ballet Theatre), the vast majority of dancers and companies maintained a deafening silence, leaving it up to the few Black professional dancers and predominantly Black companies to speak up. This is disappointing and infuriating — but not surprising.
A statement acknowledging the pain and suffering of those who walk by you in the halls and stand next to you at barre isn’t even the bare minimum in a time when the entire country — the entire world, rather — is confronting how it has failed Black people. It’s the expectation. Time and time again, the ballet world has consistently failed to turn the magnifying glass upon itself and address the many deeply ingrained instances of racism within it, much less take concrete action to combat these issues.=
I am an Asian American dancer who has trained in classical ballet for fifteen years. There were never more than one or two Asian dancers in the room, but the color of my skin does not disrupt a sea of white swans. The naturally slim shape of my body is in accord with the ideals of the art form. I have experienced a white adjacency and privilege that my Black classmates and friends have not. This is a predominantly white, wealthy, elitist, and exclusive world, one that this industry has historically sought to maintain — leaving the ballet world very little removed from the French and Italian royal courts in which it originated.
Though Arthur Mitchell broke barriers in 1962 at New York City Ballet (NYCB) as the first Black principal ballet dancer, nearly 60 years later Black principals are still an anomaly, not a norm. Misty Copeland, as the world well knows, became American Ballet Theatre’s (ABT) first Black female principal just five years ago. NYCB’s “Nutcracker” had its first Black Marie this past December.
My best friend and I were double cast as the first Asian and Black Marias, respectively, of our school’s production in 2017. The advertising materials featured the white girl who had danced the role two years prior.
Outside of predominantly Black companies like the Dance Theatre of Harlem (DTH) most classical companies still only employ around two to four Black artists out of companies that can range in size from 20 to 100 — and there are few to no Black individuals in positions of power as directors, artistic directors, resident choreographers, or ballet masters. Christopher McDaniel, of DTH, noted that hiring interest would disappear after a company’s unofficial “quota” of Black or People of Color dancers was filled — in other words, after they had a few dancers to prove their “diversity.” Just as statements of solidarity and #BlackoutTuesday squares are performative, so too are their hiring and advertising practices. Companies tokenize their Black and POC dancers, dragging them out for photo ops and displaying them on brochures, yet never cast them in principal roles for the biggest classical ballets. Prince Siegfried is not Black, the casting list says.
In addition to the severe lack of Black artists occupying the stage, the works that are performed are often appropriative (see The Nutcracker’s Divertissement) and blatantly racist. Some of the most revered ballets in the classical canon employ the use of blackface — a practice that, unsettlingly, continues today, as Misty Copeland pointed out just a few months ago when she reposted an image of two Russian ballerinas darkened from head to toe. The use of blackface for the role of the Moor in Petrushka or for exotic dancers in La Bayadere has been justified and supported as part of tradition and norm by prominent companies (the Bolshoi), revered directors (Jean-Christophe Maillot, Les Ballets de Monte-Carlo), and star dancers (Svetlana Zakharova) alike.
But the abuse doesn’t stop at fetishizing Blackness.  The ballet world, in ways both explicit and implicit, demands that Black artists erase their Blackness onstage. Misty Copeland has been vocal about being asked to “white up” with makeup for performances, and English National Ballet’s Precious Adams recently challenged the traditional uniform of pink tights and shoes, (originally designed to match the skin tone of white dancers) which “ruins the line” of Black dancers, creating a disconnect between their top and bottom halves.
Part of the problem is the lack of options, which sends the message that Black dancers simply aren’t seen. Unlike the beauty industry, which has been pressured in recent years to produce foundation in a wider range of darker skin tones, the ballet world did not begin to manufacture pointe shoes in darker shades until 2017, when Gaynor Minden released three darker shades. (Freed released an underwhelming two shades last year). Though this is a step in the right direction, it is not nearly enough. Most manufacturers have yet to follow suit, and most dancers will still have to pancake their shoes to achieve the correct shade. The color range in dancewear boutiques must follow the example of the beauty industry and work towards inclusivity.
Even with limited options available, schools still hold us back by requiring their dancers to adhere to a rigid uniform, which includes pink tights for all. At my home studio, Black dancers who attempted to wear flesh colored shoes and tights were derided and reprimanded. The doors to the ballet world are barred shut by a combination of race- and class-based inequities, making ballet schools integral to the kind of bottom-up change this industry desperately needs. Schools must work harder to nurture Black dancers, not push them out, by engaging in outreach programs like ABT’s Project Plie, which seeks to “bring classical dance to the widest possible audience” through free workshops or partnerships with the Boys and Girls Club of America, and supporting students through scholarships based on need, not merit. Companies, too, must require equity training, to educate faculty and break down explicit and implicit racist ideals surrounding ballet.
The power structure of ballet companies and of the ballet world as a whole lends itself to a rigid system in which existing ideals get reinforced by untouchable older, white, often male, leaders within the industry, and those who support it financially. The uneasy silence or cautious, quiet support from company dancers under contract is telling of their relative powerlessness to speak up and promote radical change, whether it was #MeToo a few years ago or BLM now. This only highlights other ways in which the ballet world continues to encourage inequality and racism.
So, to the directors, dancers, ballet masters, studio owners, donors, and everyone involved in this great show: What brings us together time and time again, what keeps us fighting for what some may argue is a dying art form, is our shared love for this beautiful, captivating art. The sheer joy of the stage, the rigorous demands of class and rehearsal, the wonderful friendships forged through hours in the studios, theaters, and dressing rooms. But if we believe in this art and want it to succeed, we must be willing to open our minds, have honest conversations, and put in the work to topple racist and elitist practices to usher in a new age of ballet that is diverse, exciting, and more beautiful than ever before.
Furthermore, it should not fall to the few Black dancers and artists in the industry to fight for change. Those of us who are non-Black individuals in the industry (which is most of us) must practice good allyship and shift the narrative. We are stifling young Black dancers and their aspirations, and hurting ourselves by missing out on beautiful artists. This can be the catalyst for a real change, but only if we are willing to challenge “the way things have been” for centuries.
Finally, being highly cognizant of the fact that I am a non-Black voice in this time, I want to end by promoting the amazing Black artists of yesterday, today, and tomorrow as well as some companies and causes that you might consider supporting to further this fight and push the ballet world to reckon with its failures.
Support these amazing Black dancers: Precious Adams, Michaela DePrince, Alison Stroming, Brooklyn Mack, Francesca Hayward, Siphesile November, Calvin Royal, Nicholas Rose, and of course Misty Copeland, as well as so many more.
Learn about these pioneering and legendary Black artists: Arthur Mitchell (First Black Principal Ballet Dancer, founder of DTH), Virginia Johnson (Principal Dancer, founding member of DTH), Lauren Anderson (First female Black Principal at Houston Ballet), Debra Austin (First Black Woman dancer at NYCB, First Black Woman Principal at Pennsylvania Ballet) Desmond Richardson (First Black Principal at ABT), Alvin Ailey (founder of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre), Alonzo King (founder of LINES Ballet), and many more.
Donate to companies such as Dance Theatre of Harlem, Alvin Ailey, Complexions, Alonzo King LINES Ballet, and Ballet Black.
Listen to the voices of dancers who have spoken up, especially Nicholas Rose of National Ballet of Canada, who has been doing incredible advocacy.
Donate to the Equity Project, or to Project Plie, or donate to your local schools and tell them it’s for tuition and dancewear scholarships for Black students.
Sign this petition to call ballet companies at large to more comprehensive action.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: June 21, 2020, at 7:30 p.m.
Thousands of Harvard affiliates received a racist email to their Harvard University email accounts on Saturday and Sunday from an account identifying itself as Equity Prime Mortgage.
The email — shared on Twitter by two Black Harvard professors, Braxton D. Shelley and Robert F. Reid-Pharr — stated that Equity Prime is “a lender for whites only,” and contained a racial slur and a reference to lynching. The email was also sent to affiliates at Stanford University and the University of Michigan.
Harold Reid — a media strategist representing Equity Prime Mortgage — wrote the company “recently learned that an organization has obtained a list of emails from an outside source that includes students and administrators from higher education institutions to deliver false information on behalf of the company.”
“The information was used by the unknown organization to fraudulently apply for loan applications on behalf of the individuals impacted,” Reid wrote in an emailed statement.
Reid added that Equity Prime Mortgage is working “closely” with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to determine who is responsible for the cyber-attack.
The company has gained national attention in recent days for firing the stepmother of Garrett Rolfe, the white police officer in Atlanta charged with murdering Rayshard Brooks.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay wrote to faculty that she received the email and that the Harvard University Police Department is currently investigating the incident.
“Early this morning, many members of the Harvard community, myself included, received an anonymous racist email message, whose vile language invoked the brutal history of lynching and sought to sow fear and undermine our sense of belonging,” she wrote. “The University has already taken steps to block the originating email account and has forwarded the message to HUPD for investigation.”
“The message is both personally threatening to those of us who received it, and an affront to the values of our school,” Gay added.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow apologized to Harvard affiliates in an email Sunday afternoon, urging them not to open the message if they received it.
“If you have received and read the message, I am sorry,” he wrote. “It is abhorrent and flies in the face of everything we stand for. Most importantly, its violent and abusive language comes at a time when many members of our community are already suffering deeply. I know I speak for everyone when I affirm that we stand together: A racist attack against one of us is an attack against all of us.”
Shelley said the email was “extraordinarily painful and revelatory.”
“I thought that what was more painful than the hateful, racist words and the racial epithets in the note is also the way that the message taps into the cruel reality of America — that lending practices have been one of the most extreme sights of systemic inequality,” he said.
Reid-Pharr said that such racist and white supremacist attacks against academics are “common.”
“Faculty of color and others often receive this type of abuse and then manage it alone both because we’re trying to just do our jobs and because the institution has not provided effective means to address these matters,” he wrote in an email.
“My point is that the real responsibility for attacking this problem lies with the senior administration, not the individuals being victimized,” he added.
On Twitter, Reid-Pharr shared a copy of an email he sent to President Lawrence S. Bacow and Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 in which he said this is the third racist attack he has faced in his two years at Harvard. He noted that Bacow responded “positively.”
“The time has come for all members of the Harvard community to stop sweeping these serious problems under the rug,” Reid-Pharr wrote. “Some members of the community regularly receive racist threats and harassment. The truth is out. Now the only question is what the response of the folks in whose names these noxious actions are performed will be.”
Shelley agreed that it is up to Harvard to “push back” against racism.
“I think it will continue to be important that the University finds ways as a community to push back against really evil, toxic ideas and practices that are circulating around,” he said.
Bacow wrote that HUPD and Harvard University Information Technology are both investigating the incident.
“Thus far, we have learned that the email services of Equity Prime Mortgage were compromised, and the large-scale effort also targeted at least two of our peer institutions,” Bacow wrote. “We work continuously to try to protect and insulate members of our community from such vile and offensive messages, but our ability to do so is limited by the technology available to us—work made even more difficult when external vendors are compromised.”
Dean of the Kennedy School Douglas W. Elmendorf wrote that the email — which he said impacted over 150 Kennedy School affiliates and thousands more across the University — was “part of a sophisticated attack that compromised a leading email service.”
“My heart goes out especially to our Black colleagues who received the abhorrent message and to everyone who has been hurt by this racist attack,” Elmendorf wrote. “We all need to say, loudly and clearly, that Black Lives Matter—and we all need to live those words.”
Harvard Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 wrote the school has taken “immediate steps” to block further transmission of the message.
“This racist email and all it stands for are abhorrent and run counter to the most deeply held values of the Harvard Law School community,” he wrote. “I am outraged by the ugliness and hatefulness of this message and condemn anti-Black racism and racism of all kinds.”
Mark Moloughney, the chief technology officer at Equity Prime Mortgage, said that the attack occurred using a contact form on the company’s website for individuals who want more information about loans.
He theorized that the attackers filled out the form with the email addresses of faculty and affiliates, and then pasted the racist statement into the part of the form that asked for their name. He said they may have used a bot to write thousands of emails at a time.
Screenshots of the emails posted to social media show a comma after the racist sentence, suggesting that it was in lieu of a name.
Moloughney said that Equity Prime has taken down its site and removed all its forms, but has not deleted any information and is turning it all over to the authorities.
“It’s unfortunate that this happened,” he said. “That by no means defines what we do as an organization. It’s completely against us. So we want to be very clear in calling that out as not what our company expects and delivers.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sherri A. Charleston will serve as Harvard’s Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer beginning August 1, University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced Monday.
Charleston — a historian and attorney — will be the first person to hold the new position, which was formed after the Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging completed its work in 2018.
“Sherri is an administrative leader and interdisciplinary scholar whose work at the intersection of history and law informs her efforts to translate theory into practice that improves higher education,” Bacow wrote in the announcement. “She is widely admired for her ability to integrate all aspects of an institution into her strategic thinking and decision making.”
In the new Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer role, she will report directly to Bacow, working to implement the task force’s recommendations. As a senior central administrator, Charleston will also serve as a member of the Academic Council.
“I am thrilled to see the groundswell of work that already exists at Harvard, and I look forward to synthesizing and integrating the University’s many effective diversity and inclusion efforts into a visible, innovative strategy for enhancing diversity, equity, access, inclusion, and belonging across campus,” Charleston said in a press release.
Charleston most recently served as Assistant Vice Provost for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and Chief Affirmative Action Officer at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where she also oversaw the school’s Office of Employee Disability Resources and managed undergraduate scholarship programs for underrepresented minorities.
Charleston — who holds a Ph.D. in History from the University of Michigan and a J.D. from the University of Wisconsin — also has concurrent faculty affiliations in the Departments of Gender and Women’s Studies and Educational Leadership and Policy Analysis at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
“My approach to the work is very much grounded in my academic interests in history and the law, and in thinking about how we've evolved, and how we haven't evolved, around questions of race and gender,” Charleston said in a press release.
Bacow wrote in the announcement that he is looking forward to working with Charleston.
“She will need the advice and support of people throughout the University as she begins the important work of helping us become the kind of community we ought to be. The urgency of this moment must not be wasted,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While Harvard’s campus remains closed this summer due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Harvard Ceramics Program has kicked off its summer programming Monday with a newly developed set of online courses.
The Ceramics Program — which is located on Harvard’s Allston campus and operates under the Office for the Arts — offers semester-long classes open to students and local residents during the fall, spring, and summer.
When the University dismissed students from campus in mid-March, the Ceramics Program indefinitely suspended all of its programming and courses which had been operating on-campus. Still, Ceramics Program Director Kathy M. King immediately began brainstorming ideas to run the program online while not having access to studio materials.
“We wanted the classes to be accessible, knowing that everyone can't afford a bunch of new tools or explore a new art medium without having to purchase a lot of material,” King said. “We wanted to think about what could people use around the house or could they get at the grocery store or local hardware store or order online.”
For Paul S. Briggs, an instructor at the Ceramics Program who is leading the course “Rethinking Pinch-Forming,” teaching online seemed like an “exciting possibility.”
“Pinch forming doesn't take much equipment at all,” Briggs said. “I use this same technique even when I make pie crust, so you can use just about any type of material, and if someone made a dough substance with water and salt and flour, they can use that.”
“Pinch-forming is really the ideal process to use during this pandemic and during this time of protests, because we need to be able to quiet our mind, to sit, and to be with ourselves, and you can't do pinch-forming without slowing down and being present to the process,” he added.
In preparation for teaching via Zoom, Briggs said he practiced using two cameras — one focused on his face as he speaks, and the other focused on his hands as he demonstrates working with the material.
“Usually I would walk around the class so that everyone can see inside the piece when I have something that I need to show in detail and here, I can just put the piece I’m demonstrating up to the camera,” Briggs said.
Alexandra C. Kim ’22, who is taking two online classes this summer, said while she appreciates the opportunity to “dedicate this summer to my art practice,” she looks forward to the day she can be back in the studio collaborating with other artists.
“I think on the one hand, the pandemic has offered a sort of strangely fortunate opportunity to pursue some more solitary creative activities if you are able,” Kim said. “However, I am eager to sort of resume normalcy, and I am really looking forward to being back in an artistic studio with other creative minds around me who I can constantly learn from and bounce ideas off of.”
Briggs acknowledged virtual learning’s drawbacks yet said he feels obligated to at least “give this a shot.”
“When you think about cancelling a program because you don't have access to the studio, then there's a misunderstanding of what art is,” Briggs said. “Art is about ideas, and what I'm teaching is not so much about the product, as the process.”
