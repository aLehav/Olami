Steven Spielberg’s 2021 adaptation of “West Side Story” possesses everything a musical needs: brilliant choreography, fantastic musical performances, and plenty of star power. So why does this film feel so disconnected from the musical’s Broadway roots?
With music by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, Spielberg’s “West Side Story'' introduces a new generation to the magic of musical theater 55 years after the Broadway play and 60 years after the original film. However, Spielberg ultimately detracts from much of the story’s joy with some pacing problems and unfortunate casting choices.
“West Side Story” is a musical retelling of Shakespeare’s “Romeo and Juliet” set on the Upper West Side of New York City. Instead of Capulets and Montagues, “West Side Story” employs two gangs fighting over territory called the Sharks and the Jets — one made up of recent Puerto Rican immigrants, and one of native New Yorkers.
Underneath all of its vivid colors and bright musical numbers, the film suffers from pacing problems, with its first act moving incredibly slowly. In fact, “West Side Story” does not truly find its footing until the final third of the movie — a strong finale in which all of the film’s moving parts finally work together. If the first part of the film had better set up the high stakes of its second act, “West Side Story” might have left its viewers with a more well-rounded experience.
Nonetheless, the performances in “West Side Story'' make its flaws much easier to forgive. Ansel Elgort skillfully embodies Tony’s boyishness and maturity. And though Rachel Zegler’s Maria struggles at first to find the balance between treating the source material with sincerity or light sarcasm, the actress’ representation of her character’s naïvité is key to the film’s ultimate success. Both vocal performances are fantastic, and the chemistry between Elgort and Zegler is infectious.
Ariana DeBose and David Alvarez also do well — perhaps even better — as the movie’s B-couple, Anita and Bernardo. DeBose’s performances in “America” and “A Boy Like That” demonstrate her wide range and musical talent. The true standout of the film, however, is Chino — Maria’s initial love interest, played by Josh Andrés Rivera in his cinematic debut. Rivera hits the beats of his role perfectly, playing earnest, bewildered, and vengeful easily without overacting.
Considering the recent allegations of sexual assault levied against Elgort, however, Spielberg’s spotlighting the actor in this lead role seems wildly inappropriate. In one of the film’s later scenes, Rita Moreno’s Valentina, a new character in the story, accuses the Jets of turning into rapists. This explicit emphasis of the sexually violent undertones beneath the Jets’ actions would be commendable if the subsequent scene were not Valentina comforting Elgort’s Tony. As it stands, the comment feels lifeless and vaguely scornful of “West Side Story”’s audience. Why would Spielberg choose to condemn sexual assault so fiercely in the text of the film while still employing an alleged abuser as his leading man? Though Elgort was cast before the allegations surfaced, a film this well-funded could easily have found a replacement. The decision to have this conversation in the film therefore feels confounding and performative at best, remaining incredibly disrespectful to victims of assault and in no way making up for the choice to give Elgort a wider platform through this role.
Ultimately, Steven Spielberg’s 2021 remake of “West Side Story” is successful. It does not tread into truly groundbreaking territory as a movie musical, but several of Spielberg’s changes to the original story are positive — including the creation of Moreno’s Valentina. Furthermore, the performances within the film are largely well done. Yet “West Side Story” is weighed down by pacing problems, and featuring Ansel Elgort as a lead adds a sinister undertone to an otherwise joyous film.
Though a fine revival, it does not look as though Spielberg’s “West Side Story” will replace the 1961 film, directed by Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise, in terms of cultural legacy anytime soon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the U.S. still remains far from controlling the Covid-19 pandemic in a virtual lecture at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health on Friday afternoon.
Fauci delivered the school’s 173rd Cutter Lecture on Preventive Medicine, this iteration focused on lessons learned and ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic. The Cutter lectures, which are the oldest lecture series in epidemiology and preventive medicine, began in 1912.
Fauci’s address — which was moderated by HSPH Epidemiology chair Albert Hofman — focused on the epidemiology, virology, and transmission of the novel coronavirus, along with his predictions and priorities for containing future viral transmission.
“When you have a pandemic, there are different phases,” Fauci explained. “The pandemic phase — which is the explosion that we’ve all been through — then there ultimately has to be a deceleration in the acceleration of cases. Then there’s control, elimination, or eradication.”
Fauci said the level of viral control necessary for Americans to return to pre-pandemic life is still distant, given the country’s current daily infection rate.
“One thing for sure is that 115,000 cases a day and over 1,000 deaths is not an acceptable level of control,” he said.
Fauci highlighted vaccination mandates as one important strategy to restrain viral transmission going forward.
“A combination of getting more people vaccinated, even if that requires vaccines that have to be required — namely required for employment, required in the federal government, or what have you — we’ve got to do better with vaccines,” he said.
Vaccine hesitancy has held back the U.S.’s efforts to inoculate significant swaths of its population. Fauci acknowledged that some of that hesitancy stems from public concerns over the novelty of mRNA vaccines.
“When we made the decision to make a major investment in mRNA for Covid, we actually got some significant criticism from people who were saying, ‘With such an important, historic outbreak, how could you try a vaccine that has never ever been shown to be effective for anything until now?’,” he said.
Fauci — who has become the federal government’s most recognizable face in its fight against the pandemic — said he has borne the “brunt” of these criticisms, so he “feel[s] really good about celebrating the extraordinary success” of developing reliable and effective mRNA vaccine technology.
“The general public doesn’t know that that platform technology and the immunogen design was the result of two decades of investment in basic biomedical research,” he said. “It wasn’t something that we just decided on at the last minute, that’s for sure.”
With the rise of the Omicron variant, Fauci highlighted the importance of global access to vaccines to diminish the potential for further outbreaks of viral mutations.
“We’ve got to vaccinate the rest of the world, particularly low- and middle-income countries,” he said. “Until we have a truly global response to this global pandemic, we will not be able to control it in a global manner.”
