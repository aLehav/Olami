After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Signed into law on Oct. 26, 2001 and prompted by the catastrophic events of 9/11, the Patriot Act is the reactionary product of fear and a desire for safety. The passage of the act, which expanded the federal government’s power to surveil its citizens, was in many ways a mistake that President Obama this week had the distinct opportunity to correct or at least mitigate. Unfortunately, he did neither.
Obama’s recent choice to reauthorize the Patriot Act with no additional privacy protections is more than disappointing—it is disingenuous. President Obama campaigned on a platform of transparency and strengthening civil liberties, and, although he made no commitments to letting the Patriot Act expire, he did, according to his own campaign literature, consistently assert that, “He would support a Patriot Act that would strengthen civil liberties without sacrificing the tools that law enforcement needs to keep us safe.” Instead, Obama’s extended support for the tenets of the Patriot Act that infringe on civil liberties perpetuates Bush-era policies on national security and includes no additional privacy protections.
Indeed, the reauthorization of the Patriot Act was met with overwhelming support in Congress, but this complicity is neither proof of the efficacy of the Patriot Act nor does it justify this continued infringement on a right to privacy. Similarly, the dearth of successful terrorist attacks since 9/11 is not an adequate indicator that we have been made safer by the Patriot Act—to conjecture as such is to ignore the complex matrix that defines national security.
But what the Patriot Act certainly does symbolize is the erosion of the right to privacy that the Supreme Court has ruled is implicit in a number of constitutional amendments, including the Fourth and the Fourteenth Amendments. Even without the question of the value being brought to bear, a sacrifice of freedom is not in service of either American values or the U.S. Constitution.
Rather than continuing to infringe upon civil liberties in perpetuity, we should combat terrorism by removing its root causes. This surely will not be an easy endeavor, and it will require both vigilance and collaboration between all branches of government and governments abroad. But it is not an impossible proposition and does not require that we forfeit our right to privacy to the federal apparatuses, whether they are legal or governmental.
This is not to say that there are absolutely no protections evident in the Patriot Act. But we do assert that the privacy protections that are present—which include court authorizations—are inadequate safeguards against the government’s abuse of power.
In the face of terrorism, we must hold on to what makes America a standard for liberty, not forfeit the very freedom that we hold dear.

One cannot deny that President Obama’s Feb. 27 reauthorization of key provisions of the Patriot Act compromises his pledge to scale back the Bush-era surveillance state. However, his reversal is not the product of politically expedient cowardice; it is the responsible act of a commander-in-chief placing national security before naïve ideology.
Civil libertarians condemn the Patriot Act for unconstitutionally curtailing the right to privacy. However, as no such right is explicitly enumerated in the Constitution, this protection is at best controversial. We readily acknowledge that the Patriot Act’s provisions necessarily curtail privacy, but we strongly reject assertions of its illegitimacy.
Furthermore, the fabled choice between liberty and security is not the same as the choice between privacy and security. The possession of privileged, personal information by the federal government is not in and of itself problematic; information by itself is harmless. Only the potential abuses that could result from such knowledge threaten individual liberty. Thus, it is important to establish safeguards against government abuses like the Privacy Act of 1974, which prevents the unauthorized disclosure of personal information.
The prerequisite of judicial warrants acts as one such safeguard. Some argue that the judiciary does not provide an adequate check on the surveillance state due to the politicization of judges. It would be risible to suggest that any judicial system is apolitical, but it is insulting to categorically impugn the judicial temperament of the many sober men and women on the bench who have made it their life’s work to interpret the complex issues of American constitutional law. Citing the politicization of the judiciary to delegitimize its judgments on one issue delegitimizes our entire judicial system, since it calls into question the fitness of our judges to adjudicate any issue.
Two famous examples—those of the “Lackawanna Six” and the “Portland Seven”—provide tangible evidence of the Patriot Act’s effectiveness. The act enabled the nation’s intelligence and criminal investigation communities to share information with each other for the first time; this allowed the FBI to obtain evidence that directly led to the apprehension of six members of a terror cell in Lackawanna, NY and seven members of another cell in Portland, Ore. Nearly a decade’s worth of congressional testimonies and intelligence agency reports, including the 2004 testimony of former FBI director Robert Mueller and a 29-page report released by the Justice Department that year, provides countless other specific examples of the act’s contributions to national security. While it would be foolish to assert that none of these successes would have been possible without the Patriot Act, lack of absolute necessity does not equate to lack of value.
Finally, no one disagrees that we must address the root causes of terrorism. However, American counterterrorism policy must not be a zero-sum game. We must pursue both objectives—addressing terrorism’s causes and protecting ourselves from threats already in motion—with utmost vigor. Obama’s decision to reauthorize the Patriot Act validates its crucial role as an integral element of this effort.
Opponents of heightened surveillance criticize its supporters for paranoia and fear mongering. Ironically, it is because of their own delusional paranoia about a revival of McCarthyism and an impending Orwellian state that they so easily lose faith in the ability of a government built on individual liberty to safeguard that tenet.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A couple months ago, high school senior Lauren Edelson penned a much-read New York Times op-ed decrying the misuse of sales strategies in college admissions outreach at Harvard, Boston college, Middlebury and others, specifically naming the tendency to liken one’s school to Hogwarts. As an Admissions Office tour guide, I try to keep the Hogwarts references to a minimum.  But from time to time, I, too, slip in one too many Harry Potter references, and I’ve heard many of my fellow guides do the same.  Are we trying to sell a Hogwarts resemblance when we should be selling the Harvard reality?  I don’t believe so.  I suspect that we are so oft inclined to make these Hogwarts analogies while trying to convey some graspable idea of the Harvard experience; the Harry Potter imagery is easier to relay, since many prospective students can more easily imagine them. Likewise, it is not a college admissions strategy itself that should warrent criticism or praise, but the university-specific content—or lack of it—that it contains.
In search of individuality, admissions offices are employing ever-new methods to aid in explaining the particular qualities inherent to a college.  Recently, videos has emerged as the favored way to reach this goal. But videos can also expose similarities, which can, to some degree, actually work against the purpose of underlining the differences of a college that would make a prospective student decide upon that institution over another.  For example, when the infamous “That’s Why I Chose Yale...” video was released, I heard many Harvard students mention how very similar Harvard and Yale are—the video revealed to them a likeness between the two colleges they had not thought of before.
Indeed, what ineffective Harry Potter anecdotes and videos show us is that colleges cannot rely on specific mediums or gimmicks to do the personalizing for them; they must also focus on university-specific content. Harvard’s Admissions Office does in fact have a Harvard Video, but unlike Yale’s 16-minute long musical extravaganza, it is not nearly as well known. Despite its popularity, I don’t actually know any high school students who became more interested in Yale after viewing it; sure, those who wanted to go to Yale prior to the video release wouldn’t stop bursting into song all throughout J-Term, but it didn’t seem to incite the same level of enthusiasm in others.  Harvard’s video does a better job of portraying what Harvard in particular is about than Yale’s does for Yale because it features very personalized stories of Harvard, and Yale’s, though it is definitely more upbeat and catchy, is more general. This trend toward further personalizing admissions outreach efforts is one we should follow.
The best way to achieve personalization and promote our beloved college while retaining our unique Harvard identity is to encourage more student involvement with the process.  Tour guides can only do so much with an hour-long walk around Harvard and while we try not to generalize too much and involve as many anecdotes as we can, it is not always possible. Inviting interested students to spend a day in the life of a Harvard student and sending Harvard students to high schools to speak about their time here, which the Undergraduate Admissions Council enables students to do through the Return to High School Program, will help prospective students gain a better understanding of Harvard life. Personal stories that allow a glimpse into a Harvardian’s life and enable visiting students to better grasp Harvard life will help us in this endeavor.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For just $55 these days, you can bring yourself to within feet of fighters viciously attacking each other, and pay-per-view is always available if you cannot make the trip. While this may not be all that popular in your social circle, Ultimate Fighting has been known to gather audiences of over 21000 spectators, crowds whose sizes would exceed capacity of Madison Square Garden. In terms of its scope through television viewership, Ultimate Fighting, run professionally by Ultimate Fighting Championships programming, had the highest ratings for males aged 18-34 on its cable network affiliate. Although the current owners of this mixed martial arts league bought the company for $2 million, Forbes Magazine now rates the company at just over $1 billion. It is not the rise in the popularity of this brutal “sport” that is so shocking; rather, it is the shift in the nature of spectator sports in general that UFC signals that makes this new phenomenon so notable.
If professional boxing was ever in any way elegant, UFC has stripped away any of that grace. Based off a form of Brazilian jiu jitsu, which literally translates as “anything goes,” UFC fights, which take place in an octagonal cage, involve flurries of punches, kicks, takedowns, wrestling, and, every so often, a knee to the face. Ultimate Fighting does have a set of rules to which all play must adhere, but even when the prohibitions against eye gouging and against kicking the head of a grounded opponent are accounted for, the result is still a fierce and brutal bout. An onlooker of sports could, over time, feasibly point out that the recent surge of interest in this sport is not altogether different from the popularity of professional wrestling, but there is, in fact, a key difference between the two. Whereas a great part of the fun of professional wrestling stems from the universally acknowledged truth of its theatricality and phoniness, the comforting truth that none of its wrestlers are ever hurt  (except emotionally, when they maligned in the skits and costumes that come after each fight), UFC’s compelling quality is its inescapable authenticity.
The fake blood and traded insults of World Wrestling Entertainment are intended to excite fans with their dramatic likeness, but it is UFC’s actual fighting, real pain, and serious bodily harm that makes it so exciting. Although both venues allow for violence to serve as a form of mass entertainment, that UFC has progressed so far by riding a wave of enthusiasm for actual violence is far more disconcerting. There are many sports that incorporate physical contact, but unlike UFC, personal injury is always a secondary consequence of the game, never its purpose. Professional football and hockey are two truly physically violent games, but they each contain a constructive goal that supersedes the bodily contact in importance. Ultimate Fighting, on the other hand, puts the focus solely on its violence, which renders it a uniquely and distinctly destructive experience. In place of teamwork, sportsmanship, and health benefits, UFC places egoism, detachment, and physical harm.
As much as UFC perpetuates aggressive behavior and brutality, it not only increases the violence of our collective experience, but it also changes the way in which we view spectator sports and athletes in general. For many of us, the appeal of watching professional athletes stems from our amateur days of childhood athletics; we watch our favorite baseball players because we once wanted to be one of them (It is hard to find a youngster who does not want to be a professional athlete when they grow up). Ultimate Fighting changes this relationship by providing a sporting spectacle that few people were taught about as children or experience for themselves as adults. Onlookers of Ultimate Fighting thus know exceedingly little about the seriousness of the action and inevitably become distanced from the athletic experience. With less appreciation of the fitness, strength, and agility that is required of the athletes in these bouts, a fan will objectify these men rather than empathize with them as they might a baseball player or a basketball player.
While the popularity of the UFC may someday wane like any other secondary spectator sport in our culture, during its current moment of glory, it will send an unsettling message and provide an unsavory example of violence as substance. Even if our immunity from impressionability is as strong as we believe it to be, any dip in our ability to separate UFC from our own lives could have ultimately deleterious consequences.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One has to wonder what made Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) so eager to introduce their new tax reform plan last week. The problem is not with the plan itself, which is fine policy-wise. It simplifies the personal income tax into three rates—15 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent—and eliminating most deductions while tripling the standard deduction, which has the potential to make the tax more progressive, as many deductions are only claimed by filers well-off enough to hire accountants or to have the spare time to file long returns themselves.
The problem is that this has been tried before. In 1986, Senator Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) and Congressman Dick Gephardt (D-Mont.) wrote and President Reagan signed a similar proposal, which paid for a sharp cut in the top income tax bracket by radically reducing the number of deductions and tax incentives. While by no means perfect, it was a worthwhile measure that ended numerous special interest carve-outs in the tax code. Or rather, delayed them. Within a few years of passage, many of the same incentives returned due to aggressive corporate pressure, and eventually we arrived at our current code, which is complicated enough to spur simplification efforts like Wyden and Gregg’s. Do today’s reformers really expect a more permanent fate for their effort?
The reasons for the 1986 bill’s successful dismemberment are clear enough. While there is broad popular support for a simpler tax code, that support can only be mobilized every so often. Big efforts can gain momentum, but there cannot be major pushback every time a company wants a tax credit thrown its way. With those dynamics as much in place as they were in 1986, simplifying the tax code remains a Sisyphean enterprise unlikely to reap lasting rewards.
What would provide reforms with some degree of permanence is the inclusion of provisions to make the tax code fairer. Attempts to expand the welfare state are instructive here. Before passage, programs like Medicare or Social Security are hugely controversial, but once implemented become untouchable. By providing consistent and noticeable services to voters, they build up a base of supporters ready to react when the programs are threatened. While this is occasionally detrimental—witness the backlash to the health care reform bill’s Medicare changes—it does guard against threats that the program will be rolled back. There is no reason tax reformers cannot make sure changes last through the same method. By structuring the tax system so that it provides more obvious benefits to taxpayers, reformers can make it harder, though not impossible, for special interest to touch.
The best way to do this would be through a negative income tax. Made famous by the libertarian economist Milton Friedman but supported by economists and thinkers on the left as well, a negative income tax typically works by implementing a flat income tax and then transferring a set amount of money to the taxpayer. For example, suppose the tax rate were 25 percent, and the cash transfer $10,000. A family of four with a head of household working full-time at the minimum wage ($14,500 a year) would pay 25 percent ($3,625) in taxes, but receive $10,000 as well, leaving them at $20,875—not middle-class, but solidly better off. Affluent taxpayers would pay almost the full rate, the middle class would pay a significantly lower effective rate, and the poor would actually gain money.
The U.S. currently implement a variant of the negative income tax called the Earned Income Tax Credit, which is credit to low-income workers that can be claimed even if those workers owe no taxes. While a tremendously successful antipoverty program, the EITC still has its flaws. Twenty five percent of eligible families do not claim it, a problem the direct distribution of cash in a negative income tax would solve. Also, the EITC’s monetary value lowers the more income a recipient earns, which can function as a disincentive for recipients to work. A negative income tax would grant the same amount of money to all taxpayers, meaning it is always in a person’s monetary interest to work more.
Upon implementation, special interests would strive to carve out deductions and loopholes in a negative income tax. But by providing real relief to poor and middle-income Americans, the tax would build a political base protecting it far stronger than the current tax code has. Even if that does not prevent lobbyists from amending the tax, it should still be enough to ensure that the monetary benefits of the tax are kept intact. For those of us interested in combating poverty and raising middle class incomes, that ought to be worth it.

Only 3 percent of Harvard students do it, but that’s only because the other 97 percent don’t even think of it as a real possibility. No, I’m not talking about sex; I’m referring to living off-campus, which is even rarer than a horizontal tango on a twin-extra long. Take it from someone who’s recently changed her House affiliation for the third time (Mather to Currier to Dudley) while spending her senior year living in the Back Bay. Upperclass houses may be the supposed bedrock of Harvard social life, but that doesn’t mean you’re obligated to love or stay in the concrete monstrosity that contains the shoebox you call “dorm.”
The benefits of living off-campus are so numerous that I’m surprised students aren’t moving out of their rat-infested walk-throughs in droves. Here are just a few:
1) You get all the benefits of House life (Stein Clubs with trashed housemates!) without the drawbacks (brunch with awkward, sober housemates).
2) You can do semi-legal drugs. Marijuana, for example, is decriminalized in Massachusetts, but if you get caught smoking on campus, you’ll still have to deal with the Ad Board (conversely, you could just transfer to MIT, which has turned a blind eye to dorm room LSD production in the past).
3) You can pretend dormcest never happened. That HoCo chair you fucked two weeks into your three-year residence? Never have to see them again. Related, my next point...
4) There’s built-in social filtering. As a super-senior, this is especially crucial. I have nothing against hungover 19-year-olds brunching with their hungover 19-year-old pals (that used to be me, after all). I just don’t really want to be their friend, and I’d also prefer if they weren’t part of my Sunday mornings. Or, you know, my college experience.
5) You can indulge your quirks. Whether it’s going to sleep at 10 p.m., or enjoying the pleasures of recreational nudity, House life isn’t really compatible with eccentric habits. I fall into the latter category, and nudity is sadly not tolerated in dining halls (unless you live in Dudley Co-op), and can in fact sometimes lead to ostracization. At home, the only thing I risk when dining in the buff is first-degree burns.
So if living off-campus has so many upsides, why don’t more of us do it? Perhaps the reason is because Harvard students derive so much of their identities from their House affiliation—or, at least that’s what’s encouraged. The hype surrounding Harvard’s housing lottery is rivaled only by that of Hogwarts’ Sorting Hat. Consider the elaborate pre-Housing Day rituals, which include taking a shot at every coveted house and burning boat sacrifices for the “River Gods.” I’m an atheist, and yet even my freshman self wanted to believe that there was some higher power who was really invested in getting me into Eliot. Granted, not everyone gets the housing assignment they want, but in the end, even the most cynical new Quadling can be turned into an enthusiastic convert who chirps endlessly about “singles for life” (this is actually an old Mather slogan, but since they introduced partitioned rooms there during my junior year, the phrase is now really more applicable to the Quad).
Once we move in, there’s countless inter-House contests which fuel our unhealthy obsession with competition and bond us with our housemates by fooling us into believing that a recycling drive and an online game of Risk are proof of our superiority to people who live in that place called Dunster. What Harvard students lack in school spirit, we make up for in House spirit. Given that we have practically none of the former, we’re less than eager to let go of the latter, even though physically living in a House isn’t a prerequisite for being really proud that you were randomly assigned to it.
If what you’re worried about is paying for an off-campus pad, keep in mind that you, your parents, generous donors, or some combination of the preceding are currently shelling out $11,000 for your annual room and board fees. That’s enough to cover the cost of an apartment and groceries, even if you have to budget. If you’re on financial aid, you get reimbursed proportionally to your package.
Unlike sex, there’s not really an excuse not to move off-campus, unless, of course, you actually lucked out with your room assignment. I personally found the dorms to be much less satisfying than advertised, but maybe that’s just because I didn’t properly pay homage to the River Gods.

They have no titles. They cast off bureaucracy for what one member describes as “effortocracy.” They have “digs,” not meetings. So what is it exactly that the Diggers do?
According to member Talia N. Lavin ’12, the Diggers are committed to creating ways for students to come together and share ideas, feeding already-established  passions and sparking new ones. Frustrated with the “intellectual parochialism” she sees at Harvard, Lavin wants people—herself included —to feel free to abandon the “pre-formed self-definition” that makes many scared to venture outside their specialties.
As for the 1960s hippie collective in Haight-Ashbury that shares the Diggers’ name: “We’re a little more institutional and stodgy than they, but it’s all the same idea: freedom and self-empowerment,” Lavin explained.
The Diggers Society hosted its first event, a student lecture series, on February 5. Topics included democratic theory, flight map reading, modern Hebrew, and even happiness.
Leslie R. Rith-Najarian ’12, a psychology concentrator, spoke about the effect that stress’s role as the “weather topic” at Harvard has on students’ moods. She’s already had many listeners tell her that they’re applying her lessons; even Lavin now asks herself, “What would Leslie do?”
Speaker Joshua J. Nuni ’10 lectured on his thesis on political theory, using it to segue into a discussion about the Diggers. He attended Deep Springs, a two-year college of about 25 male students in the California desert. Listening to the student speakers at the event, Nuni says that he almost felt as though he were back at Deep Springs.
“Aside from an op-ed, how do you talk to the student body at Harvard? Where’s the forum? It’s literally non-existent,” said Nuni, who has been working to create a student center at Harvard.
Nuni would like to see the Diggers go further, holding events in the spirit of Tuesday meeting at Deep Springs, in which anyone present could go up and speak.
The Diggers have a similar idea—they’ll host their first storytelling exchange next Friday.
“Our tagline is ‘creating a sense of intellectual community and thriving public discourse at Harvard,’” said Lavin. “Storytelling is literal public discourse.”

In response to the new outreach initiative directed toward LGBT-identified applicants at the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 emphasized Harvard’s commitment to providing information to concerned applicants without invading students’ privacy.
Through Penn’s new program, announced last week, current Penn students involved in the LGBT community contact students whose applications indicate that they may be interested in gay life at Penn.
The Harvard admissions staff attends college fairs aimed at LGBT students and provides contact information online for staff and student groups who can answer questions about LGBT issues for interested students.
“We want to make certain that they understand that Harvard is a good place for students of all sexual orientations,” Fitzsimmons said. “We do everything in our power to make sure we’re reaching out to those students, given the discrimination in many high schools that LGBT students face.”
However, he said he worried that reaching out to specific individuals could be seen as a breach of privacy.
“We’re particularly concerned about some situations when a student may have real difficulty with their family because of their orientation,” he said, noting that this issue sometimes affects parents’ financial support.
Marco Chan ’11, co-chair of Harvard Queer Students and Allies, also said that privacy was an important concern. However, he said that avoiding such discussions would not help LGBT students feel more welcome.
“[Penn is] reaching out to students according to information the students volunteer, and the ones who would be comfortable enough explicitly stating their sexuality might not be the ones who need outreach most.”
Eva B. Rosenberg ’10, Chair of the Harvard Transgender Task Force, said that Harvard could avoid this dilemma by offering information about resources, policies, and support for the LGBT community to all applicants and not only those who may identify as LGBT.
“There are ways to let people know that they could be involved in queer movements or groups without assuming any particular identity,” she said. “I think students should be prepared to face and embrace communities of all kinds, and that’s what makes the Harvard experience unique.”
Chan said he would like to see a more formal outreach program from Harvard’s admissions office.
“High schoolers who identify as LGBT could definitely use a lot of outreach in knowing that their future college offers a welcoming community to people who identify with all kinds of genders and sexualities,” he said. “The onus is on the school and the school community to demonstrate that they are proactive in creating a safe environment.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Education Committee of the Undergraduate Council voted yesterday to advance legislation creating a student-run advising website called “Crimson Commons,” which will allow students to seek informal concentration advice from peers.
After some adjustments, the proposal was approved in a unanimous vote by the five members present.
The adjustments addressed concerns from members of the Committee on Undergraduate Education that the site’s prospective “concentration moderators” would be unqualified or would dispense advice that was inaccurate or conflicted with advice from other advising resources.
EdCom Chair Joseph Y. Kim ’12, who is spearheading the project, had a clause added stating that moderators would be chosen through an application process. The committee also added a promise to “reach out” to departmental directors of undergraduate studies before moving forward with the site.
Kim said the template for the forum has been created and the process of informally soliciting applications for moderators has begun, including reaching out to Peer Advising Fellows. However, the project is far from approval—the next step will be review by the UC Executive Committee.
The Education Committee acknowledged the likelihood of increased administrative involvement.
“We always thought of it more as a ‘College Confidential’ type thing, but I understand the administrators’ concerns,” said EdCom Secretary-Treasurer Peter Chen ’13, referring to the website CollegeConfidential.com, where students can exchange advice about college admissions.
PAF Evelyn R. Wenger ’11 said the program could fill a gap because there are not PAFs from every concentration, and added that administrative supervision could have benefits and drawbacks.
“I wouldn’t want adults to be interfering with the candid nature of the advice, but would want there to be some sort of responsible entity keeping an eye on things,” she said.
The committee also discussed the status of the proposed online “Expos Marketplace” where students could find  partners to trade assigned Expository Writing sections.
“Instead of a command and control system, we’d like to see a marketplace where students can trade,” EdCom member Youn Sang “Richard” R. Hwang ’13 said. “It would be great to have the maximum number of people get the choices they want.”
Senior Expository Writing Preceptor Karen Heath wrote in an e-mail that sectioning 800 students each semester is complicated, and concerns like concentration conflicts have to be prioritized.
“But we also care deeply about giving students the best possible chance to enroll in a section of their choice, and we’re delighted to work with students on developing additional ways to make that happen,” she wrote.

Internet censorship “runs exactly counter to what Google is all about,” Debby Soo, a former content acquisition associate at Google, said yesterday during a panel discussion on the ongoing conflict between Google and China.
Soo—who is currently a student at the MIT Sloan School of Managment—joined Kennedy School International Affairs Professor Anthony Saich and Harvard Law School Professor Jonathan L. Zittrain in a discussion organized by the International Affairs Council at the Kennedy School.
On Jan. 12, Google threatened to quit the Chinese market if the Chinese government did not discontinue its internet censorship practices. The company announced this consideration following China’s alleged attacks on its computer systems.
According to Saich, such censorship of information results in a “lack of transparency,” a “lack of trust,” and an “attitude of paternalism.”
Soo said the company’s headquarters did not like some aspects of the way Google China operated. For example, Google China often selected business partners based on personal relationships, she said.
When Google first announced that they might pull out of the country, the initial reaction of its employees was a skeptical one, Soo said, as the company was pouring a substantial amount of money into China and receiving noticeably smaller returns.
Zittrain told the audience that he ran a test to determine the words the Chinese government censors online and found that the four most censored topics are pornography, church, drugs, and politics.
Unlike internet censorship in other countries, the Chinese government does not inform internet users that the restricted Web site is blocked when they try to enter the site.
Instead, the page will simply say that there is an error with the Web site, Zittrain said.
Chinese internet users can circumvent the censorship with a number of techniques, including using a virtual private network, a type of software that allows users to connect to an internal network from computers outside the network.
The fact that people can go around the ban shows that the Chinese government is not determined to completely block the sensitive pages, Zittrain said, only to prevent a larger number of people from visiting them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lowell House will occupy a floor of the overflow housing at 20 DeWolfe Street next year, reversing efforts over the past three years to make the House smaller and more contiguous, resident tutors said yesterday.
Between 24 and 28 Lowell undergraduates will occupy the floor, which Kirkland House will be vacating next year, according to Lowell resident tutor Van C. Tran.
The decision comes less than a year after Lowell pulled out of Claverly Hall—a building now used entirely by Adams House—in order to make the House smaller and more geographically compact. At its peak, Lowell had more than 420 students, according to Tran. Last fall, the House had 362 students.
Kirkland House Master Tom C. Conley said last week that Lowell House’s agreement to accept a floor of DeWolfe overflow housing will help enable Kirkland to withdraw from the former apartment building.
“We were not excited about DeWolfe, but we felt a sense of responsibility—a sense of shared responsibility,” Tran said of Lowell’s decision to house students in DeWolfe.
For more than four years, the Kirkland House Masters have wanted the House to be able to leave DeWolfe due to unfavorable feedback from the residents—primarily sophomores—who occupied the building, Conley said.
To avoid a reccurrence of the same situation for Lowell, Tran said that a pair of current Lowell tutors, as opposed to new hires, will be placed in DeWolfe in order to help cultivate a connection between DeWolfe residents and Lowell House.
“We need a strong couple in DeWolfe,” he said. “We don’t want students, especially sophomores, to feel like they don’t belong in the House.”
Associate Dean of Harvard College for Student Life Joshua G. McIntosh would not confirm that Lowell will occupy DeWolfe next year, writing in an e-mail last week that “there is really no news to report related to DeWolfe.”
“I am continuing to work with the respective House Masters on this matter and expect to have more clarity on this issue later in March,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Faculty members confronted Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith yesterday with a barrage of questions about recently implemented budgeting measures that will grant him more authority than ever before in determining where FAS centers direct their funds.
Smith responded to faculty members’ concerns by saying that their angst was the result of miscommunication about the policy.
The new budgeting strategy, known as the “first-dollar principle,” requires that departments and centers spend their restricted funds according to thus far unspecified FAS “core principles.” Since area study centers—such as the Center for European Studies—are traditionally autonomous units that depend largely on restricted endowments and donations, center administrators were concerned about losing control of their spending priorities.
“The governance of the centers has always been in the hands of the faculty associated with them in partnership with FAS,” said Susan J. Pharr, director of Harvard’s Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies. According to Pharr, Smith had reassured center leaders at a meeting on Friday that he would refrain from taking full control of their budgets.
“But let’s be clear, under the new budget paradigm, the dean claims the right to do so,” she said.
David G. Blackbourn, the director of the CES, rose to support Pharr’s opening statement.
“What, sir, it seems you are asking now is to take control, and this raises serious questions of what a center director is trying to do,” Blackbourn said to Smith.
Blackbourn also emphasized his concerns that donors—on whom centers rely heavily—might be unwilling to contribute if they believe their funds will be used for FAS priorities rather than those of the particular center.
Responding to each of the five center-affiliated professors who voiced concerns, Smith confirmed that the “first-dollar principle” will not enable FAS administrators to use center restricted funds outside the precepts laid out by the donor.
Smith said that “core principles” for spending—a term used in a budgeting letter sent out to department and center administrators clarifying the new policy—would be determined in conjunction with center administrators.
“I have no idea what that priorities are of your center until you tell me,” he said.
University President Drew G. Faust supported Smith in his defense of the new FAS policy, asking centers to participate in what she said was a new phase of the school’s response to the budget crisis that has left FAS with an $80 million deficit—down from $220 last academic year.
“I would hope that no unit would want to be immune to that kind of questioning and priority setting,” Faust said.
But some professors proposed that Smith rewrite the budgeting letter and hold a town hall-style meeting for concerned members of the community.
At yesterday’s meeting, the Faculty unanimously approved the integration of global health policy into the current secondary field in health policy.
Economics Professor David M. Cutler ’87 said that the new Standing Committee on Global Health and Health Policy will create an “umbrella” for studies in domestic health policy—already a popular secondary among undergraduates. Studies in global health policy are currently limited to General Education courses and interdisciplinary courses in other concentrations.
“It will allow us to provide a home for courses that are currently taught where there is no home for them,” Cutler said.
Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will also see a new concentration in Biomedical Engineering following a unanimous vote at yesterday’s meeting. Bioengineering Professor David J. Mooney said that field is becoming increasingly relevant in the engineering world.
Though students have already been focusing on biomedical engineering studies, Mooney said the new concentration will build an academic path that includes courses in chemistry and biology in addition to other SEAS courses.
“Harvard has a responsibility to train the future leaders of this field,” Mooney said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Portraits of notable former University administrators grace the robin egg blue walls of the Faculty Room, and busts of the particularly eminent stand atop pillars.
But to the knowing eye, one guest was conspicuously absent from the arrangement of busts: former University President Abbott Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877.
Though portraits are animated only in the world of Harry Potter, this apparent disappearing act was the second of its kind this year. In September, the portrait of former University President Charles W. Eliot, Class of 1853, was missing—an absence pointedly observed by faculty meeting attendee and former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68.
So in his opening remarks at yesterday’s Faculty Meeting, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith was prepared to explain where President Lowell had been taken: the bust and its pedestal, like the portrait of President Eliot, had been sent for maintenance.
But “we still have a portrait of President Lowell hanging,” Smith said. “We are very pleased to have him here and”—eliciting a wave of laughter from the meeting attendees—“look forward to having his bust back.”
It was an airy beginning to what became a tempestuous gathering.
CELL PHONE
As the meeting moved into the question-and-answer phase, a series of irate professors stepped up to the microphone to contest Smith’s newest budgeting strategy—“first-dollar principle”—as it applies to various FAS centers. Professors said they were worried that the new strategy puts too much budgeting power in the hands of administrators.
After each of the five professors spoke, Smith stood to defend the plan, explaning that such issues were largely ones of miscommunication.
But in the middle of one such response, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Professor David J. Mooney’s cell phone began to provide an unplanned accompanying tune.
Mooney first grabbed at his pocket to silence the jingle, but his subtle grasp did not turn off the noise.
After a few moments and to the chuckles of some faculty members, Mooney stood and shook out his coat jacket for the offending phone.
Meanwhile, Smith continued to answer questions, and after a few more pocket-grabs, Mooney succeeded in quieting his phone. No one in the room full of professors chided the flustered culprit.
But when Mooney himself took center stage at the close of the meeting to move to establish a undergraduate concentration in Biomedical Engineering, nearly an hour after his phone made its debut, he apologized for the disturbance.
On the Faculty Meeting agenda, Mooney’s motion on a Biomedical Engineering concentration was listed as the second order of business.
“I had thought that the second agenda item would come up soon,” Mooney jokingly told the faculty present, who had been seated for nearly two hours.
Mooney had been teaching before yesterday’s meeting and thought he would need a reminder.
“I set the alarm to make sure that I made it,” he said. “Upon arriving at the meeting he forgot to turn off the alarm, and it tolled.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For any collegiate team, no matter its division or conference, the conclusion of the regular season does not usually mark the end of competition.
Instead, looming on the horizon, are postseason tournaments, which provide the final opportunity to reach one’s potential, to show one’s skill, and to claim a title for personal, team, and school glory.
The Harvard fencing team is no exception to this sentiment.
For the talented, young squad, the Ivy tournament last weekend did not mark the close of its season, but rather the start of even more intense and demanding competition in the coming weeks.
First, the Crimson will travel to Providence, R.I., for the NCAA Regionals on March 14 to determine which individuals will qualify for the prestigious NCAA Championship that will take place on Harvard’s campus on March 24 and 25.
Hosting the tournament affords the Crimson a special chance to truly demonstrate its strength and the growing popularity of fencing.
“The nice thing about this is, of course, it gives us the opportunity to showcase the sport right here at Harvard,” coach Peter Brand said. “We’ll have the chance to bring in a lot of spectators and show fencing to the larger community.”
This is the first time the Crimson will host the NCAA tournament for fencing, which has been held annually since 1990, despite the fact that Harvard boasts a national championship from 2006 and a number of individual champions before and since that time.
Although not always dominant in their Ivy bouts, the Crimson teams hold strong records this year both collaboratively and personally, and are in a viable position to do well in tournament competition.
The men posted a 14-7 record overall and a 3-2 conference record, finishing second as a team in the Ancient Eight conference.
Leading the squad are sophomore Valentin Staller and freshman Ben White, both of whom were named to the All-Ivy League first team, and captain Karl Harmenberg, who was named to the second team.
“Our men’s team has gotten stronger over the year,” Brand said. “Certainly, we’ve shown our strength, coming in second this season after finishing last the previous year.”
On the women’s end, Harvard finished the regular season with a 15-8 overall and 3-3 Ivy record, surrendering two conference losses in the tournament last Sunday.
Sophomore co-captains Noam Mills and Carolina Vloka, and sophomore Shelby MacLeod head the women’s effort, also garnering first team All-Ivy honors in the epee, sabre, and foil, respectively.
“[The women’s team] is not as strong or deep as it was maybe a year or two ago,” Brand added about his women’s squad, “but they’re peaking now and are reaching their potential.”
Brand, who has coached the Crimson since the 1999-2000 season, has seen teams that have had perfect 11-0 records, Ivy and National titles, and individuals that have gone on to bout for their countries in the Olympics.
As his team fights for national recognition, Brand sees the promise of its future, as well as the strength of its individuals, many of whom have a chance to vie for a top spot in the NCAA Championships.
“We’re not deep enough to win a national title, but certainly on the individual side we have top notch athletes who are contenders,” Brand said with confidence. “Valentin, James [Hawrot], Karl for the men, Noam, who won the silver last year, and Caroline each have a shot for a medal.”
The first challenge will be qualifying as many of the individuals as possible in Providence to make good on the opportunity to showcase on home turf.
For Brand, post-season tournaments do not mark the end of a year, but rather the beginning of a new cycle of recruiting, training, and competition. What Harvard is currently lacking is a strong third fencer in each weapon, an absence that is holding the Crimson back from title contention, and one that the coaching staff is hoping to fill. With a young team of mostly freshman and sophomores, accompanied by a powerful recruiting class, the possibilities will soon be endless on the Ivy and National level.
But for now, it’s all about the elusive postseason, the time when winners are made and dreams are broken. The future of fencing is around the corner, but for now, it must wait until after the NCAA Championships.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s lacrosse team made a major statement this past weekend, sending a signal to other teams that it is serious this season with a decisive 16-6 beating of the Canisius Golden Griffins.
With momentum from the victory, the team will look to continue its winning ways against the Georgetown Hoyas (0-1) tomorrow in Washington, D.C.
Though the eleventh-ranked Crimson (1-0) has just started the lacrosse season, its players are happy with the way the team is playing.
Junior Dean Gibbons scored an impressive five goals on six shots and sophomore Jeff Cohen had three goals and an assist in last week’s victory.
“I thought we played well,” junior midfielder Andrew Parchman said. “Everyone was pretty focused. We started out slow, but found our stride at the end of the match.”
“It’s good to get a win in the first game,” Harvard coach John Tillman said. “The guys will have some confidence going in against Georgetown and use that confidence to move forward.”
Yet, the Crimson will have to fight even harder to stay undefeated.
The Hoyas are currently ranked fourteenth in the country, despite losing a close battle to No. 7 Maryland, 15-13.
Harvard and Georgetown have a brief but exciting history. Last year, in the squads’ first meeting together, the Hoyas squeezed past the Crimson, 9-8 in overtime.
“We know that Georgetown is a better team than Canisius,” Cohen said. “We’re really excited and it will be a good test for us. We think it will be a great opportunity to show that Harvard is for real this year.”
Despite this confidence and optimism going into tomorrow’s matchup, the Crimson realizes it will have to prepare for the unique style of play that the Hoyas will bring to the field.
“They like to come out and pressure us,” Cohen said. “We’re going to see a lot of things we haven’t seen before. We just cannot get nervous and have to play like we play every other match. We can’t let the pressure get to us and we’re going to have to deal with the adversity if we get down early in the beginning.”
With hopes of beating Georgetown for the first time, Harvard is putting in extra time on the field and in the locker room to make sure that each player is ready for the test tomorrow.
“We’re watching tapes from last year’s game and focusing on what we can do better as a team,” Cohen said. “We really like to focus on each game individually rather than what team we’re playing.”
Even though the Crimson is excited about proving itself early in the new season, Harvard lost several of its seniors in key positions to graduation last year.
Now, the Crimson must turn to some of its newer members to fill in these gaps. As a result, Harvard had to train harder in the offseason to ensure that players would be ready for their new roles.
“We’ve just got to step our defense up,” Parchman said. “A few of the guys are stepping up into defense spots since a couple of seniors graduated last year. We just need to live up to the expectations and execute on game day.”
“The guys continue to raise the bar every day,” Tillman said. “We just keep working hard every day and continue to work at a higher and faster level.”
A win against the Hoyas would provide the momentum necessary for the Crimson to improve on last season’s 8-5 record. Even with the pressure on its shoulders, the team still remains optimistic in its chances of defeating Georgetown to continue its currently undefeated season.
“The feeling on the team is that we can beat anyone we come up against,” Parchman said. “I don’t mean to be arrogant, but we feel we’re going to work harder than Georgetown and the other teams.”
The outcome of the match is still uncertain, but one thing is clear: the Crimson’s confidence going into the match tomorrow. Pulling off the win against the Hoyas will prove it is a team to be recokoned with this season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jeremy Lin averaged 17 points and six assists in the last two home games of his career, earning the Harvard co-captain Ivy Player of the Week. The league’s Rookie of the Week award went to teammate Brandyn Curry, who averaged 17.5 points and five assists over two nights.
But the most memorable performances on the hardwood of Lavietes Pavilion this weekend did not belong to either of them—or to any basketball player, for that matter.
During halftime and timeouts on Friday and Saturday night, the Harvard cheerleading squad quickly scrambled into formation at center court. Pom-poms and signs at the ready, each member wore a neat crimson uniform, a clean, white ‘H’ adorning the chest. The team launched into its carefully synchronized routines, perfected through hours and hours of practice.
Among the numerous owners of bright eyes and gleaming smiles, one stood out above the rest. She soared gracefully through the air and tumbled like a veteran, and her energy was infectious.
“She’s very talented, confident, and obviously, a very skilled flier,” says Allyson McGinty, a spotter in the stunt group. “I was really impressed.”
She had never practiced with the team before. Yet, on Saturday night, the student section devoted an entire chant to her.
Her name is Amya, and she’s nine years old.
GIVING BACK TO DEE
The national cheer circuit is a rough-and-tumble establishment. High-stakes competitions take place across the country in pressure-packed environments, to which Amya [pronounced Ah-Mye-Ah] Giger is no stranger.
Every weekend over the next four weeks, she’ll be traveling to events all over the South with her teammates from Rockstar Cheer. She’s a flier on two teams—the Eagles and the Smashing Pumpkins—both of which are 18-years-and-under squads.
The life of a top-level cheerleader becomes even more difficult when a classmate’s flu or a family member’s cold could lead to an extended stay in the hospital.
Such is the life of Amya, who has been battling tracheobronchomalacia, severe asthma, and a compromised immune system ever since she was about a year old.
According to her mother, Amya immediately fell victim to a case of double pneumonia at birth in June 2000.
A year later came the diagnosis of TBM, defined as a weakness of the tracheal and bronchial walls due to softening of the supporting cartilage. In other words, Amya’s windpipe is especially susceptible to collapse.
Equally as critical has been her weakened immune system. Amya must take care to avoid any sources of disease-causing particles, as a relatively common infection can easily attack her lungs and lead to severe pneumonia.
Up until the age of five, Amya’s home was the hospital. Her mother, Chele, stayed with her at a nearby Ronald McDonald House, but her father had to stay at home, making the four-hour drive to Duke University every other weekend.
Since then, the going has been a little easier. Amya’s condition is managed today through 11 different medications, which she takes at the public school she attends.
Still, her childhood has been rife with frightening moments. Amya required early surgery to remove her adenoids and tonsils, and constant ear infections led to the placement of titanium tubes in her ears.  And just last year, surgery was performed to remove growths from her vocal cords.
The burden would have been a formidable challenge even for parents blessed with the luxury of focusing all of their attention on a single child.
But Amya is the youngest of a family of six children, one of which also has special needs.
As a result, her five brothers and sisters—Jessica, Demetrius, Makayla, Gaige, and Tai—have had to come together and rely on each other. Demetrius—who also goes by Dee—took the lead without complaint.
“He played [the role of] Dad and Mom when I was in the hospital with Amya,” Chele says. “He stepped up to the plate and didn’t complain; he maintained his grades; he still managed to play sports; all in all, he was the second parent for about nine years.”
One of Amya’s fondest memories came at the age of four, when the Make a-Wish Foundation organized a family vacation to Disney World to go see Mickey Mouse and Goofy.
It’s not as easy to make those trips now. Jessica has a family of her own, and Dee is off at college. He’s a freshman on the Crimson men’s basketball team.
That’s why Amya decided to go to visit Dee at school, as a way to show her gratitude for everything he has done over all these tough years, for “supporting me my whole life,” she says.
And she chose to thank her oldest brother by doing what she does best—cheerleading.
After one’s battled a life-threatening congenital disorder for nearly a decade, the 800 miles from Asheville, North Carolina, to Cambridge don’t seem so daunting. Neither does performing in front of a crowd of over 2000 at a Division I basketball game.
“I was kind of scared,” Amya says.
No one in attendance could tell. Arriving at halftime during Friday’s matchup against Brown, the 4’7 Amya—decked out in an official Harvard cheer uniform—showed off her tumbling ability.
The next evening, she participated in warm-ups with the cheerleading team and was able to take flight. Pausing momentarily from jeering Yale’s players, the raucous student section responded to her aerial acrobatics, coming up with a chant for Amya on the spot.
Dee, a 6’6 wing, played a total of 17 minutes against Brown and Yale last weekend and has seen action in all 26 of the Crimson’s games this season. Described by Scout.com as “one of the best shooters in North Carolina” coming out of high school, he’s still in the process of finding a consistent stroke as a part of the Crimson’s impressive freshman class.
It’s clear, though, that his talents are by no means limited to the basketball court.
“I was wanting to cheer for my brother because I think he’s awesome,” Amya says.
And doesn’t he know it.
“The first thing she did was waving at me, blowing kisses at me, giving me hugs,” Dee says. “She wanted me to know that she was there, because I was always there for her. It was special.”

Remember that nightmare you had where you were trapped in a precarious maze of teetering books and found yourself racing up and down five flights of stairs looking for an exit that didn’t have the word “emergency” stamped above it? That really happened—at least to Timothy S. Kim '10.
Kim found himself trapped inside the International Legal Studies building of the Harvard Law School Library late Sunday night.
It started out like any other trip to the library’s Langdell Hall. Kim’s research on the expansion of judicial power led him to visit the ILS building to obtain some Chinese language material. ILS is connected to the main library by a bridge and—unbeknownst to Kim—has different hours of operation than certain floors of the main building.
At 12:30 a.m., Kim began to pack up his books cheerfully beating what he thought was a 1 a.m. closing time. But that illusion was shattered when he reached the door.
The doors leading from the ILS building to Langdell Hall were locked and featured a distressing message warning that if anyone pulled on the doors for more than 15 seconds, the alarm would sound. Reaching out a tentative hand, Kim grasped the door for a split second, but when beeping followed he quickly retracted his hand.
Then, Kim weighed his options.
“I considered for about 20 seconds just triggering the alarm and running out,” he said.  “But then I figured I probably wouldn’t make it because the second floor of Langdell was still open for law school students and I figured with the alarm sounding they’d descend upon me and rip me apart.”
After stepping away from the door and breathing a sigh of relief that the beeping had abated, he realized that he had left his phone charging in his room. So, he did what any rational student would do in his situation: he updated his Facebook status. “Timo Kim is locked in the library,” it read.
Kim proceeded to try each of the ILS building’s five levels, looking for an exit that was not armed with an alarm, but he found none.
He turned once again to his only connection to the outside world: his laptop. He wrote a surprisingly calm e-mail to the PBHA and Dunster House lists, among others, in which he requested help escaping.
At about 1:30 a.m., someone suggested over e-mail that he call HUPD—but Kim still didn’t have a phone.
“There are some comfy bean bag chairs on fourth floor of ILS,” Kim said.  “I thought, if I have to spend the night here, that’s what will happen.”
Eventually, he decided to contact HUPD—via Skype.
“There was a strange person coming out of the elevator, which kind of freaked me out,” he said.  “But then I realized, oh, it’s just a HUPD guy.”
Safe and sound the next day, Kim had become a minor campus celebrity—his escapades had been referenced on ISawYouHarvard.com.
“I saw you... e-mailing the PBHA list to find an alternative exit to the law school library because you were trapped there. It instantaneously cancelled out the annoyance of having loads of PBHA e-mails come in every day, and made being on that list worth it,” read the entry.
So what’s the moral of the story?  According to Kim, it’s to check library hours before you go.
And when in doubt, Skype HUPD.
