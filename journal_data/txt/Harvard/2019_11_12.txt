Pristinely paced and unflinchingly political, "The Report" is a well-polished exposé on the inhumane Enhanced Interrogation Techniques deployed as counterterrorism measures in the wake of 9/11. Storied screenwriter Scott Burns (known for “The Bourne Ultimatum” and his frequent collaboration with director Steven Soderbergh) was in attendance at the Brattle Theatre on Friday, Nov. 8 to unveil his directorial debut.
"The Report" focuses on the Senate investigation, led by Senator Dianne Feinstein (Annette Bening) and Daniel Jones (Adam Driver), into the CIA's use of EITs in the War on Terror, both evaluating their success and weighing in on the moral repercussions of such reprehensible practices. At its core is a story about accountability and ethics, with a timely message that truth matters in today's political climate of "fake news."
“The Report” is thematically more consistent with Adam McKay’s “The Big Short” and “Vice” — films with a penchant for uncovering the truth in ways that invigorate a response from the audience, usually incredulity or disbelief. However, Burns couldn’t made a more diametrically opposed stylistic film. Where McKay uses comedic timing, fast edits, and breaking the fourth wall, Burns uses careful dialogue and a slower pace to concoct a political thriller more closely matching George Clooney’s “The Ides of March” or even Alan Pakula’s “All The President’s Men” in terms of pace and tone.
Burns' well-informed script peels back key revelations with an urgency that succeeds in stimulating audience interaction with the subject matter. "The Report" is told from Jones' perspective so as he peels back layers of the investigation, the audience does too. It's a key narrative framing technique that puts all viewers — even those without the faintest political background — on the same page in following a deeply technical story.
For such a taut political thriller, "The Report" surprisingly tackles its sensitive subject matter head on with an unflinching look at the EITs through undoctored scenes of waterboarding and physical abuse. These scenes are few and far between but are nonetheless harrowing and disturbing. While they can seem out of place in a dialogue-heavy film, these scenes shake the film with an otherwise inconsistent intensity and are essential in taking the audience from disbelief to disgust. Burns banks on the expectation that when the audience is invested in the subject matter, they will also be invested in the story, and in "The Report," that expectation is met.
However, Burns focuses so much on telling the story truthfully that he neglects to develop his static characters. Jones ends the movie at the same place where he started, and that's in no part due to Driver's committed performance. At times, it feels as if Burns was presented with a choice between thematic and narrative payoffs, and that he prioritized the thematic. This is often disappointing, because there are fragments that could have felt much more cohesive with integrated character development; for instance, when Jones is placed under imminent personal risk from the investigation, it's difficult to care about his character's fate beyond empathizing with his extensive efforts in the investigation.
For an Amazon Studios production that will make its way directly to Amazon Prime Video, “The Report” looks more like a television show than a theatrical experience: There's nothing spectacular cinematography-wise aside from some striking symmetrical long shots. There’s even a small, but noticeable (and sometimes distracting) amount of handheld camera shots that appeal to the small-screen approach but detract from the film's glossy finishing. At times, it's evident that "The Report" is Burns' first directorial effort; some of the scenes (which are mostly conversations) are blocked so simplistically one might expect such a layout from a theater play. Furthermore, the camera is extremely static, turning the audience into passive, rather than active, observers. Ultimately, these disappointing choices leave "The Report" feeling tedious and repetitive in short spurts — even when its script so adamantly isn't.
"The Report" succeeds as an informative and stimulating docudrama, but often loses itself as a compelling narrative with fleshed out characters. It marks a promising debut from Burns, but what stands out about his first directorial effort is still what he does best — writing. “The Report” will begin its limited theatrical run on Nov. 15 before being released on Amazon Prime Video later this month.

It’s 2019 — “vape influencers” are performing juul tricks on Youtube, the President of the United States is in a Twitter Feud with Chrissy Teigen, and TikTok is still a thing. Many might yearn for a simpler time just a decade ago — a time when Lady Gaga’s meat dress was breaking news, and the greatest threat to young livelihoods was a Sims 2 addiction.
Yet beneath the noughties facade of tiger-stripe highlights and Classic Short Ugg boots lies a society still reeling from the global financial crisis in preceding years. Indeed, it is a stunning testament to the persistence of human creativity that in the same year that brought the most dramatic employment contraction since the Great Depression also blessed the canon with “Twilight” and “Party in the USA.” Could this be a coincidence? Was 2009 pop a disturbing hyper-capitalist escapist fantasy, or simply symptomatic of fragmented artistic and sociopolitical spheres? And when the bops are this good, does it matter?
Trump Sues a Reporter for Calling Him a Millionaire Instead Of A Billionaire
Remember when Donald J. Trump counted as pop culture? Even over two years into the presidency Trump’s 2009 hijinks aren’t without their novelty, with a highlight being his two-year, $5 billion defamation lawsuit (which he eventually lost) against journalist Timothy L. O'Brien, who stated in 2005 that Trump "was not close to being a billionaire.”
"My net worth fluctuates and it goes up and down with markets and with attitudes and feelings," Trump, in a deposition, remarked upon the dispute. "Even my own feelings." Truly, a man of the people.
Miley Cyrus Releases “Party in the U.S.A.” at Age 16
The Wikipedia page for Miley Cyrus’ hit 2009 single “Party in The U.S.A.” states, “The song is a pop song.” This statement is woefully inaccurate. “Party in The U.S.A.” is not a pop song — it is ‘the’ pop song, the sonic identity for all teens, past and present, who just want to “put (their) hands up.”
The dance anthem isn’t without its controversies — young Cyrus’ live performances involved pole dancing on an ice cream pushcart, to the disapproval of mothers of tweens across the land. In later years, “Party in the U.S.A.” saw a surprising resurgence in popularity following the death of Osama bin Laden, becoming an anthem in the fight against Al-Qaeda.
All of Your Friends Were Either Team Jacob or Team Edward
Remember when the “Twilight” franchise was the talk of the town — amongst Abercrombie-wearing tweenagers, at least? Whether you were a die-hard Stephanie Meyer fan or just really bought into the Taylor Lautner body transformation narrative (the man had to gain 30 pounds for “New Moon!”), it is undeniable that the cultural landmark that was “Twilight” transformed youth culture — as well as bringing back brunettes, paleness, and moss-green zip-up hoodies in a big way.
A Lot of Subpar Cinema Was Released, And We Lapped it Up
Why was “Avatar” such a big deal? As fun those reusable IMAX 3D glasses were, it is tricky to explain why millions flocked to see a generic hero-type fall in love with a 10-foot tall blue alien called Neytiri. Perhaps it was because there weren’t many other options for entertainment — also released in 2009 were “Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel,” which saw the Chipmunks enroll in American public high school and tackle bullying, as well as “Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian,” which is basically the same as the first movie except Ben Stiller is three years older. In all cases questionable content — but with a crazy-eyed earnestness that we’ve grown to love, or, in other words: peak 2009 energy.

On Nov. 1, Apple TV+ launched with original, star-studded television shows including “See” (starring Jason Momoa), “Dickinson” (starring Hailee Steinfeld), and “For All Mankind.” Apple TV+’s flagship series is “The Morning Show,” which stars Jennifer Aniston (in her first major television role since “Friends”), Reese Witherspoon (hot off the second season of “Big Little Lies”), and Steve Carell (a.k.a., Michael Scott from “The Office”). Let’s just read that sentence again, and realize just how star-packed Apple TV+’s most high-profile project is.
The series focuses on Alex Levy (Aniston), the longtime host of “The Morning Show,” a popular news program. Her life and successful career, as well as the show itself, are upended when Levy’s co-host of 15 years, Mitch Kessler (Carell), is fired over allegations of sexual misconduct in the workplace. Yes, I know what you’re thinking — this show is similar in many ways to the fall of Matt Lauer on “Today.” Even worse for Levy, Kessler tells her that the network was planning on getting rid of her before his termination. As Levy fights to keep her job, she also engages in a rivalry with Bradley Jackson (Witherspoon), a younger and edgier journalist who is tapped to replace Kessler.
“The Morning Show” offers what may be the very best performance of Aniston’s career. As mentioned previously, Aniston plays a character who is fighting tooth and nail to retain her status as America’s top morning show anchor. Behind the scenes, she goes toe to toe with her male bosses in an attempt to be treated with more respect and dignity. The network executives seem to forget that Levy is actually the one waking America up every single damn morning. She also refuses to let the grossly inappropriate behavior of her former partner affect her own career path: a timely response that mirrors the career rises of Hoda Kotb and Gayle King after the sudden falls of Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose, respectively.
Witherspoon also churns out a well-rounded performance. Jackson’s life is completely turned upside down, going from a local journalist in West Virginia to a morning anchor on America’s morning show. Simply put, her story is true rags to riches, and yet, Jackson doesn’t change who she is as a person. As a result, Jackson often says things and asks questions that irritate the show’s executive producer, which lends the show its humor. To round things off, Carell plays a very convincing disgraced TV star, although I am very fearful that “The Morning Show” wants us to sympathize with a sexual predator. While the show wants us to start an important conversation about whether disgraced men not as “bad” as Harvey Weinstein should be able to make a career comeback, the show, more times than not, spends way too much time on the accused man and not nearly enough time on his actual victims.
Even though “The Morning Show” is enjoyable and highly bingeable, the show can’t help but feel as if it’s missing that extra something, especially given its stellar cast who deserve more. For starters, the show seriously lacks high-stakes drama, with most episodes moving at a sluggish pace until the last couple of minutes, in which something momentous happens that makes you want to click “Next Episode.”
For a show that reportedly cost over $300 million for its two-season order, the show is not actually that visually impressive. Sure, it’s high-definition, but the set of the show-within-a-show is underwhelming, to say the least. The fictional morning news program that Levy and Jackson host isn’t particularly exciting either, and it’s hard to see how it is supposedly one of America’s most watched broadcasts.
All this said, Apple TV+’s “The Morning Show” is by no means the next big TV show that gives Netflix a run for its money. As much as “The Morning Show” isn’t a particularly good show, it’s not bad either, and there is really nothing better than watching Aniston back on TV again.

In a cover interview with W Magazine, Frank Ocean shared that he is no longer sure if strength and vulnerability are compatible. From an artist whose albums delve deeply into his upbringing, past relationships, and fears and who shared his unreciprocated first love in an open letter he posted on Tumblr, this is a shocking revelation. In spite of Ocean’s avoidance of the public eye, his music is so powerful because it is honest and intimate. On “In My Room,” a single released on Nov. 2, Frank Ocean gives insight into what this turn away from vulnerability looks like. On the track, he moves away from R&B ballads and soulful lyrics, instead using pop-inspired beats and stream-of-consciousness lyricism.
The single opens with the repetition of a synth piano melody punctuated with smooth, thumping bass. Although the simple techno-pop beat doesn’t initially feel like Frank Ocean — most of his discography has mellow beats and instrumentals that are much more full — the change is far from an unwelcome one. The production is clean and spacious, and occasional laser sound effects prevent the beat from getting too repetitive. Frank Ocean enters the track with a long verse that explores fame, wealth, and sex with cleverly written wordplay. He changes subjects rapidly and seemingly at random, opening with the words, “No sleeper seat, that’s a mattress.” A few lines later he raps, “I’m not fake patient, I don’t fake sick / That kinda coffin don’t need lean,” using the word “coffin” to simultaneously refer to lean, the drug made with cough syrup, and deaths that it is associated with.
The song takes a quick turn in lyrics and delivery towards the end. Ocean’s abstract rapping about his wealth and confidence turn over to more melodic singing, where his armor seems to crack. He croons the line “Quit being violent with me” three times. After a short but weighty pause, the plea changes to something that feels more like a threat: “You make me violent.” In the outro, he sings “My room, my room with me / I guess I can't state my feelings too soon / I don't know you.” The paradox of someone being in Ocean’s room, an incredibly intimate space, but Ocean being unable or unwilling to take the emotional jump and share his feelings lingers on the closing beats of the song.
More than anything else, Ocean’s latest releases create even more anticipation for what is to come. The cover for “In My Room” features Ocean sitting on a bed, staring defiantly into the camera. This pose is replicated in one of the 17 silhouettes that decorate the bottom of the cover, hinting at the release of an album. If these tracks are representative of Frank Ocean’s direction following his critically acclaimed album “Blonde,” they suggest that Ocean is experimenting with abstract concept songs that lack clear narratives. Regardless of the change, Frank Ocean pulls us in with beautiful vocals, a style not found anywhere else in the industry, and just enough vulnerability to keep us waiting for more.

Julie C. Dao’s “Song of the Crimson Flower” is a frothy, contrived concoction of pleasure reading and little more, offering far more shallow style than substance.
The “Song of the Crimson Flower” begins when young Lan, a wealthy member of the aristocracy, rejects the heartfelt proposal of Bao, a poor orphaned fisherman and physician’s assistant. After such a vicious, flinty dismissal, Bao flees his home and proximity to Lan and her family, and on his journey encounters a powerful river witch who seems to know him and casts a spell upon him. She reduces Bao’s essence to a ghostlike form inside his flute and decrees that the only way to reattain his true form is if a declaration of true love is made before the next full moon. She tells him to head south to the Gray City, the ominous birthplace of black spice, an opium-esque drug that pollutes Dao’s fictional society, to find his mother, who should surely love him. When Lan finds Bao’s flute and discovers the tale, to amend for her former cruelty, she accompanies him on the long trek, avowing to atone.
On the one hand, Dao’s fictional landscape is richly envisioned and lavishly textured; she describes the docks near Lan’s home with luxurious care: “Boats swept over the water, packed with nets of wriggling fish, buckets of jackfruit and spiny durian, and baskets of sweet, fragrant pastries wrapped in banana leaves… Men and women who had once played as children on the riverbank now rowed their goods to shore.” Likewise, Dao paints the tainted opulence of the Gray City’s drug trade with sinful decadence; Bao’s “skin crawled at the sight of the bronze-and-cypress furniture, the rare painted scrolls, and the jeweled trays… Death and black space had gilded each table and upholstered each chair with silk.”
But “Song of the Crimson Flower” is unfortunately a novel of surface-level embellishments that lacks a concrete foundation. Though Dao lavishes pages on expositional descriptions, she skims other vital points of narration. She does not, for example, describe a large battle that happens at the Gray City; rather, she diverts the reader’s attention to the escape of the protagonists from the palace. They emerge to find that the battle has more or less been miraculously won. Difficult, all-encompassing questions of plot progression do not develop and build over time. Instead, Dao places her protagonists against a backdrop of a war that conveniently falls into place around them.
In fact, Dao charts both plot and character development unevenly. She does not introduce the concept of a larger war until a third of the way through the novel, which is not terribly long to begin with. Likewise, she introduces a tangential romance to a group of side characters that appears hastily constructed. She simply does not devote enough attention to the romance and its development to make it credible — or, in a much more real sense, interesting for the reader. Dao has the unfortunate habit of introducing plot digressions far too late into the novel that she does not fully resolve. If she does reconcile them, she does so in the last few chapters, with hastily murmured declarations of love and miraculous battle techniques that the reader never actually sees.
One of the larger issues with the “Song of the Crimson Flower,” though, is its tendency toward the trite. It’s a novel of tropes, many of them world-wearied and worn. The motif at the center of the story, after all, is the unrequited love of a hapless peasant at the hands of a member of the nobility. Look at Wesley and Buttercup in William Goldman’s “The Princess Bride,” Anne and Captain Wentworth in Jane Austen’s “Persuasion,” or, even in a less literary sense, at Rose and Jack in the “Titanic.” The romance at the center of the “Song of the Crimson Flower” is wholly unexcitable; even its eventual outcome is predictable. The love story is so formularized, in fact, that it makes its progression almost boring for the reader. It ends with Lan’s tearful remission: “I’m sorry I wasted so much time. I’m sorry I never saw how wonderful you were.” Forget trite: It’s tired.
This all said, the “Song of the Crimson Flower” is not an irredeemable read. It’s pleasant, light fare, if one does not pay too much attention to a somewhat slapdash plot and unoriginal storyline, and Dao is a skilled worldbuilder. It’s a novel meant for quiet, unconcerned escapism.

On Saturday, Nov. 9, the MIT Museum held a day-long special event celebrating Polaroid — the Cambridge-born camera that captured people’s hearts from its invention to its modern day resurgence.
The ongoing Polaroid Project exhibit, tied together by a wide strip of the signature Polaroid rainbow, showcases artwork of all styles as well as the various iterations of Polaroid cameras. Cases of artifacts dominate the center of the room, while artwork, grouped by style, lines the walls.
Beyond the exhibit, the day’s agenda included a storytelling hour, a showcase of historic Polaroid models at a “Polaroid Petting Zoo,” spotlight tours with the curators, and a presentation entitled “Lady Gaga, Polaroid, and the MIT Museum: A perfect trifecta.” The exhibit also featured interactive elements, including a community pop-up installation, where visitors were encouraged to bring their own Polaroids and add them to the wall. The opening day of the exhibit marked Polaroid Reunion Day, an open invitation for former Polaroid employees to talk and reminisce while surrounded by the products they helped create and the resulting artwork.
Former employees Peter Carcia and Ladan Homayoon discussed what it was like to work under the large and influential company that Polaroid has become.
“It was a hierarchy that didn’t think women would make good engineers,” Carcia said of Polaroid’s earlier days. “I made it a personal thing to go find a talented woman. Ladan is a talented engineer.”
“We were just laying the bricks as they were driving the train,” Homayoon added.
For the former employees, the exhibit inspired nostalgia: Some of the very cameras they helped develop were on display.
“I worked on SX70, the first camera you see here. I worked with TI to put together the circuit,” Carcia said.
The exhibit itself mirrored the art-meets-technology ethos of the company: The museum page notes that the display encompasses “various dimensions of the art-technology relationship through the exhibition of both art and artifacts.”
“It was something I really enjoyed about being there, that it was both an engineering company and that they were so interested in the arts,” Jennifer K. Ellwood, a former engineer in product design at Polaroid, said.
Homayoon also commented on Polaroid’s contributions to the evolution of contemporary photographic artwork. Just as the art of painting had its movements, the influence of various artistic styles appear in the show’s Polaroid artwork as well: The exhibit features impressionism, mixed media, still life, and collage, to name a few. Short blurbs on the walls highlight these vaguely grouped styles and explain each movement, as well as its applicability to Polaroids.
“The way Monet and the whole impressionist movement came about was because paint became portable and they were able to create paintings really fast and in real time,” Homayoon said. “Polaroid did that.”
Beside the artwork, display cases stand populated by different iterations of Polaroid cameras — some more robust, others more technical. From the very first Polaroid built to the more modern Polaroids of today, the exhibit holds a wide assortment of the company’s large, classic machines. Some display cases hold prototypes and moving parts, while still others spotlight the specific engineer that helped develop that camera.
“I’m kind of drawn to the cameras, they just look out of place — thinking about how your cameras always fit in your phone [these days],” Tin D. Nguyen, an MIT volunteer, said.
Though the older Polaroids may now be outstripped by slimmer, higher-tech cameras, many at the exhibit said they feel Polaroid has its place in the modern digital age — and that its current second wind is valid.
“There are so many different ways to use Polaroid products and film, like you can manipulate the images once the image comes out, you can have them instantly … there are things that Polaroid still offers that the digital cameras don’t. So in that way I do think they’re still valued,” Ellwood said.
Audience members and participants throughout the exhibit said that they saw limitless potential for Polaroids — and that this classic camera won’t be going away any time soon.
“I feel like… people rediscover these things, and for a new generation, it has a lot of novelty value,” Nguyen said.

“You gotta be loud, I only like loud girls,” Mikaela Straus, better known as King Princess, told a screaming and mildly aroused crowd at the House of Blues on Oct. 30. Shrieks of delight rippled from the section of the pit that received a wink from the artist. Someone threw a bra onto the stage.
Throughout the night, Straus made love to fewer than Joplin’s 25,000 people, making sure to mention her girlfriend so we knew she would not be going home alone. Her carnal stage presence is a true composite of the dirtbag rock icons who came before her — queer or otherwise. Though Straus flexes her originality as a songwriter on her new record, “Cheap Queen,” the Cheap Queen concert experience seemed intent on fashioning its star as an inheritor of, or merely a perpetual homage to, the music of sexual liberation and a long tradition of rock-star impetuousness. Yet she played the role so well that the audience hardly noticed long enough to stop dancing.
After performances by a handful of high-kicking drag queens and fiery guitar work from her backing band, Straus bounded onto the stage in a whirlwind of leather and skin — eliciting gasps of sexual confusion from the straight women in the room. She paused, in queer contraposto, at the top of a white staircase, framed by two pairs of daintily posed hands that cupped her from behind like the shell of Venus. The backdrop, a tranquil nature scene, provided a sharp counterpoint reminiscent of Wes Anderson whimsy.
Swaggering down the steps, Straus opened the show with a commanding rendition of “Isabel’s Moment,” played on an acoustic piano that sat just in front of the audience on the stage. She banged at the keys with the firm fingers of Elton John and the grandiosity of Lady Gaga singing “Speechless” (a song which Straus coincidentally covered) live and with a glass of whiskey.
Straus stood up and proceeded to play a few of the slower tracks from her new album — “Tough on Myself” and “Prophet” — with an upbeat intensity that enlivened the melancholic, sad-gay lilt which tinges her recorded music. She welcomed the audience with a twisted form of warmth — “Welcome to the Cheap Queen tour, bitch,” she spat. The crowd went wild.
Just under two years after releasing her first single, 20-year-old Straus has become something of a queer sex icon at meteoric speed. In September, she posed for Playboy as both a cheerleader and a varsity letterman. She recently cut her hair from a soft bob into a choppy, Joan Jett meets Mick Jagger shag. And beyond the explosively literal sexuality of her emergent discography — the song “Pussy is God” speaks for itself on this point — Straus has carefully cultivated the persona of a snide, unadulterated id: the mildly arrogant New Yorker who knows that everyone now wants to have sex with her. More acutely, everyone wants her to have sex with them.
The version of King Princess onstage — brash, pelvic-thrusting, leather-diaper-wearing — embraced this burgeoning dimension of Straus’s appeal. Her constant hip gyrations, some of which included the mic stand as a phallic prop, evoked a sexed-up Elvis. Midway through the show, a stagehand was summoned to unzip the aforementioned leather diaper from Straus’ body in a moment of pure, concertedly campy spectacle.
From her opening “bitch,” though, something seemed intentionally unpleasant about Straus. Sucking on a straw from a red solo cup, she repeatedly called offstage for “more juice” in between numbers even as she became visibly drunker — never mind the fact that she’s underage. During the final encore, a rockified rendition of the unreleased ballad “Ohio,” she persisted in kicking over the mic stand, not once, not twice, but three times, each time after which the same poor stagehand shuffled sadly out of the wings to right it once more. These choices seemed self-conscious, as if she were proving a point that she, too, could abuse her body and treat people miserably, just like the rest of her gender-transcendent (yet mostly, practically, male) rock ancestors.
Based solely on the industry weariness Straus projected throughout the concert, one would imagine she’d been around the block. She introduced “1950,” a candy-coated tale of repressed queer love that pays homage to its closeted ancestors — and undeniably the song that jump-started her career — as “the one I’ll be playing until I fucking die.” Considering that the song came out in February of 2018, it’s difficult to accept just how far this new, sexier, and drunker King Princess may feel she’s strayed from her sweeter teenage origins.
But to be fair, Straus is only 20, finding fame during the years of her life in which we all experience the greatest rate of change. Undeniably, she has broken barriers in pop, inspiring a legion of non-conforming folks and manifesting the most basic desires of the queer community — that we hear ourselves, explicitly, in the music that dominates airwaves. She bears the weight of a long legacy, one she both embodies in its radical queerness and resists accepting in its prescription. For better or for worse, King Princess matters, more so than the average pop star. What happens when the act of self-destructive degeneracy becomes more than just a performance? It may be unfair — but one cannot help worrying, somewhat selfishly, that she doesn’t age herself before her time.

On Nov. 8, eight Boston area artists faced off in a fast-paced, multi-round live art competition. The special event, hosted in the Studio Hotel Allston and sponsored by Q-Mixers, is part of the Art Battle U.S. National Championship series. The competition featured three rounds of live art in which the eight artists only received 20 minutes to turn a white canvas into an artistic piece. None of the artists were given prompts, so each painting was able to reflect the distinctive styles of the competitors.
The artists were split up into two groups of four, where the first group competed in round one and the second competed in round two. After each of the first two rounds, spectators were able to vote using the Art Battle app for their favorite piece. The two contestants from each round who received the most votes then moved onto the third and final round, where the winner would then be chosen to represent Boston for the next round in Miami. As the rounds commenced, spectators were allowed to move clockwise around the competing artists, giving them a chance to see the creation of the art from beginning to end.
The competitors included Rixy, Curtis, Sagie Vangelina, Massimo, Jameel Radcliffe, Esoteric (Ian Staber), Adam O’ Day, and Pete Cosmos. Radcliffe, O’Day, Rixy, and Curtis made it to the third round. And after the third and final round, O’Day was chosen to represent Boston in Miami.
After each round had concluded, the art pieces were put up for auction. Bids started at $50 dollars and any audience member, using the Art Battle app could make an offer.
Before the battle began, Ananda Toulon, an 18-year-old Boston artist, served as the event’s opener. An immigrant from Dominica, Toulon attends Boston Arts Academy and is an artist who works with Artists for Humanity — a nonprofit organization that provides under-resourced teens paid employment opportunities in art and design.
As the featured artist for Art Battle, Toulon was given 45 minutes to paint a piece of her choice. She described the painting as a self-portrait, and added that much of her art is inspired by human faces.
“I try to inspire myself because that’s where the idea factory is but in terms of life, people’s faces are my main inspiration. They are just so different,” Toulon said. “I try to capture personality and things and souls, instead of it just being a picture, I want it to have a feeling attached.”
Sean Bono, the co-founder of Art Battle, spoke highly of Toulon’s work. He said that one of the missions of Art Battle was to put a spotlight on talented artists — such as Toulon — who are not as prominent in the field.
“I used to believe that the art centers of the world were the places where we needed to make the biggest impact. But [what] I didn’t realize, which I realize today, is that the areas where incredible artists are is where we need to be. Our main goal is really to stay in line with our mission and provide a platform for emerging and professional artists all over the world,” Bono said.
For James Trevino, the Founder of Artpie Studio and the host of the next Boston Art Battle on Dec. 2, Art Battle is wholly unique experience.
“It’s cool because you are bringing art to the masses in a way but [artists are] are also getting immediate feedback, which kind of helps them in the process,” Trevino said. “Even though these are not hourly paintings, it gives [the artists] a clue of what the public really likes.”

“The lungs of the earth are on fire.” Newspaper headlines have inflamed people around the world with coverage of the climate-linked forest fires devastating the Amazon. The flames alight the largest tropical rainforest have drifted almost two thousand miles and blackened the skies of Sao Paulo since August. Amidst this unprecedented deforestation and burning threatening the planet’s biodiversity and oxygen supply, artists like ArtFashion Daria Kurtumulus refuse to remain silent. With massive deforestation and wildfires threatening the planet’s biodiversity and critical oxygen supply, they seek to awaken public consciousness to the existential threat of climate change by transforming business as usual in their respective mediums. Through innovative forms of public engagement from clothing-based performance art to botanical exhibitions, these artists occupy new spaces in public view, making clear the message sent by the Amazon forest fires in a time of climate emergency. Even as they approach the task using different mediums,they all work to bring these fires so near to people that complacency becomes a painfully active choice.
Making fashion a form of protest, Kurtumulus employs her design skills in Amazon-themed performance art. In one YouTube video, she represents the Amazon on a T-shirt by painting a pair of lungs — one half of which teems with life while its fire-consumed complement forebodes unparalleled destruction. For the first half of her video, Kurtumulus paints the life-affirming lung, which she comprises of mossy green tree leaves and surrounds with a hummingbird and butterflies. Its pastel colors induce mysticism in the vast and still much undiscovered biodiversity of the Amazon. The second half of the video, however, exposes the fragility of this beauty when after intersplicing her work with footage of the Amazon’s destruction, Kurtumulus’ second lung combusts into flames that leap across her chest. The work portrays the sharp contrast between the Amazon that viewers, present and future, may know — one of life or death — and challenges them to pick a side in the battle for its conservation. From a tranquil tone overlaid with peaceful bird chirps, the music in the second half of the video quickens in pace and strikes a tone of alarm, fomenting a palpable sense of anxiety in viewers that matches Kurtumulus’s race to finish the T-shirt design. Wearing her shirt, Kurtumulus coughs against her arm as if unable to stop herself and puts on a gas mask, staring straight into the camera. The moment issues a far more direct challenge to her audience — with the planet’s lungs at risk, so are her viewers’.
The Amazon fires are also inspiring a new activist edge in ecological art-themed exhibitions within gallery walls. Last month marked the end of the “Brazilian Modern: The Living Art of Roberto Burle Marx” show at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, New York, the tone of which rapidly evolved from one of pure tribute to the Amazon to one a fervor of resistance to its fires. Beyond paintings, sculptures, and landscape designs that harkened back to Burle Marx’s past projects in Brazil were more subtle works with signs later added by the curators that spelled out startling statistics about the fires and their horrific ecological impacts. Working to raise awareness among the show’s visitors, the signs also concretized inseparability of one’s local environment and daily experiences in nature from the greater global ecosystem. Also through an immersive experience for viewers, the Amazon fires have infused Brazilian artist Ernesto Neto’s “Children of the Earth” installation in Hollywood with new meaning. He creates a jungle of multi-colored fabric with crocheted sacks and knotted ropes hanging from a webbed ceiling and draping onto lazy red couch cushions. Immersing spectators together in the sense of a seamless natural environment — one whose feel sharply contrast to the quotidian of urban life — through physical interaction with the installation’s various components, Neto induces a feeling of collective stake in its preservation, while also hinting at dangers that humans pose to it. Every spectator is a “child of the earth” as they inhabit the installation — joining the fabric of the mystical world it creates. Like the Burle Marx show, this exhibit posits the inseparability of human and non-human life, exposing not only the interconnectedness but the mutual dependency of human existence with that of natural wonders like the Amazon, even as people may not always recognize such wonders’ pull on their lives.
Amazon artists also claim social media as a realm of resistance. Through easily shareable images and the use of hashtags such as #PrayForTheAmazon, they make the reality of destruction accessible — putting it at the forefront of Instagram feeds to awaken an impulse for action in the public consciousness. These evocative, vibrantly colored images convey the breath of life that the Amazon fires put on the line. Some, like those by Mariana Matija and Gretta ConGanas, blend striking visual, from angry smoke pillows rising arising out of a flame-engulfed canopy to gas mask-wearing mother and child duo stumbling upon a tree in an extinction-themed museum, with Spanish phrases to make poetic and explicit calls to action against the threat of mass extinction. Matija directly links her art to organizations working to protect the Amazon that spectators can support, effectively using the platform of social media to solicit a direct impact from her audience.
Across digital and physical mediums, artists are working fiercely to put one fire out — one that causes the destruction of the Amazon and the vast life it contains— and set a new one aflame — the public will for climate action.
— Contributing writer Ilana Cohen’s '22 column, “Expressions of the Climate Emergency,” is a nonfiction column that discusses artistic response and resistance to the climate crisis.

In a six-hour program entitled “Malleable Forms — Define Abolition,” visiting lecturer Xaviera Simmons set out to challenge social and racial norms through art. Held in the Annex of the Arthur M. Sackler Building on Nov. 6, the participatory experience incorporated film screenings, group activities, and talks by students and guest speakers.
According to an online description, the event explored the “undoing of ‘whiteness’ in its many forms” through analysis of systemic racism and the American carceral system. Simmons, the Department of Art, Film, and Visual Studies’ inaugural Solomon Fellow, has previously explored race relations and inequality in her interdisciplinary work, including photography, sculpture, and multimedia installations.
“There is simply no way that I can work in one medium and be fulfilled as an artist. Period!” she said in a 2014 interview with Caroline Picard for the David Castillo Gallery.
In her opening statement for the program, Simmons spoke about the struggles of people of color in contemporary America, citing a 2017 Boston Globe survey in which 54 percent of African Americans rated Boston as “unwelcoming” to people of color. She then discussed the inseparability of the United States’ current power imbalance and its long colonial history, describing systemic inequality as a “sensational, heartbreaking problem.” Among the injustices she named were the appropriation of Native lands, the persistent racial wage gap, and the frequent human rights violations in the U.S. prison system. Simmons called for a restructuring of America’s capitalist society, urging audience members to come to terms with the country’s historical exploitation and oppression of black and Native populations.
“Name what whiteness is and the centuries of harm it has done,” she said.
After Simmons’ speech, guest speaker Jackie Wang, a poet and Ph.D. candidate in the Department of African and African American Studies, took the stage. Wang began her presentation with a passage from the conclusion of her 2018 book “Carceral Capitalism,” blending prose and poetry in a discussion of prison abolition. She then shifted to a “meditation on images and what it means to look,” assessing the normalization of American public surveillance as a screen displayed an image of a confused Wang at a passport kiosk.
“What a person sees is shaped by the place from where they look,” Wang said.
Wang listed several “factors that shape perception”: wealth, power, and privilege. She then examined the media’s tendency to misgender transgender and non-binary prisoners, thereby depriving them of autonomy and “boxing them into normative framework.”
Soraya Shockley ’21, the afternoon’s first student presenter, said that taking a class with Simmons inspired her to “stretch PowerPoint to its limits” during her search for the ideal medium for her project. Her slideshow, “Somewhere Between Poplar and Cedar,” analyzed her own complicated relationship with slavery through the lens of her first trip to Lebanon at five years old, when she met her grandmother’s Filipina maid Leona. Shockley, who is of Palestinian-Lebanese descent, acknowledged the ongoing protests against the Lebanese government before explaining the country’s kafala system, a method of migration sponsorship for laborers which many have likened to slavery. As she narrated how Leona’s role under kafala taught her an early lesson about “work and coercion,” she noted that her family compensated Leona for her grueling labor.
“Our American money floated this kafala,” she said.
In a packet distributed to visitors at the entrance, Shockley explained the motive behind her work. “I felt there was no other option than to look inward, to scrutinize, and ask lots of questions out loud,” she said.
Next, Ayanna Aubourg and Mallory Hanora, representatives from an organization for incarcerated and formerly incarcerated women and girls, explained their goals to visitors. They defined terms central to their argument — white supremacy, criminalization, abolition — and asked the audience to brainstorm more sources of social and racial control. Hanora stated that the group’s mission is to “build compassion and solidarity.”
“Human conflict is real. What do we do when that happens?” she asked.
Hanora and Aubourg passed out flyers for local prison reform initiatives, including their group’s efforts to bail women out of Boston’s infamous South Bay prison.
Xochitl Morales ’22 and Carlos O. Agredano ’20 concluded the event with a performance commemorating the recent legalization of street vending in Los Angeles that ended a decades-long ban.
“[The installation] employs and manipulates traditional celebratory practices to illuminate how black and brown people are exploited by capitalistic structures,” the program notes read.
Dressed in blue aprons and caps, the pair danced around a replica food cart, handing audience members notes with calls for social justice. Morales described Los Angeles’ more than 50,000 street vendors’ defiance of the ban as a “bold display of civil disobedience.”
A reception following the program featured the music of Uri Schreter, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Music. As visitors discussed the afternoon’s takeaways, Schreter accompanied their conversation on a Kawai electric keyboard.

Prior to a panel discussion, the Longwood Symphony Orchestra (LSO) graced the Harvard Business School’s Klarman Hall with a classical performance. The LSO, an orchestra comprised of medical professionals who also happen to be highly trained musicians, combines music and medicine to serve the community. Moderated by Harvard Business School faculty member Amitabh Chandra, LSO members Lisa Wong, Leonard Zon, Psyche Loui, and Thomas Sheldon spoke on their understanding of the relationship between music and medicine on Nov. 4.
The program began with a performance of Aaron Copland’s ”Quiet City,” featuring solos from Thomas Sheldon and Leonard Zon on English horn and trumpet, respectively. The panel that followed highlighted the intersection of music, medicine, and innovation.
“In music we study to produce the sound of our instruments and how they blend with others,” Sheldon said. “We later realize that the most poignant moments in music are often in near silence or silence itself. In the clinic, a moment of quiet support — a hand on the shoulder — often means much more and is more healing than detailed explanations… Training in music helps us to recognize and see the value in these moments.”
Wong gave context to the tenets of the LSO, referencing the Healing Art of Music program that the group established to fundraise for medical nonprofits.
“[We] look at each concert as an opportunity to be the doctor for another organization. How can we heal another nonprofit organization? So we meet them where they’re at,” Wong said. “We’re healthcare providers, musicians, and stewards of the health of the wider world and community, and that’s what feeds our souls and keeps us coming back to rehearsals.”
Next, the 20-person orchestra filled Klarman Hall with instrumental sound once again, playing selections of Edvard Grieg’s Holberg Suite, Op. 40. Chandra then initiated a question and answer session.
“Another metaphor that I would use is the notion of dissonance. In music, sometimes things that aren’t harmonic…are actually very beautiful, and it’s something to listen for,” Sheldon said in response to a question about the parallels between working in a medical team and working in a chamber ensemble. “You have to be alert to dissonance — when people aren’t getting along, when patients aren’t happy — and not shun them.”
“It used to be you’re seen by a surgeon, you’re seen by an oncologist, but now many people are seen by everybody together and it’s kind of like its own little orchestra,” Zon added.
The LSO used Felix Mendelssohn’s Sinfonia No. 10 in B minor to concluded the program with a classical sound, and Mojib Z. Ghaznawi said he was pleased.
“The performance was amazing. As a classical artist…I absolutely loved it, and they said exactly what happened to me: music was able to place you in a different reality, or different place of qualitative existence, that’s part of the power of music and I felt that tonight,” Ghaznawi said.
The panel discussion made Sebastian V. Agignoae contemplate applications for mental health.
“I think this is an almost mission critical conversation to be had … Particularly, I’m thinking more in terms of mental health. I think a lot can be found in how music can be used as a platform to address people in conflict zones, people who have escaped traumatic situations,” Agignoae said.
The conversation augmented the curiosity of some audience members, including visiting physics scholar Hao Dou.
“I have several questions. What kind of music is more suitable for the patients? How does the musical treatment have a good effect for the patient?” Dou said.

What does a rhyming 9,000-word one-man play about an Irish bartender have to do with modern American immigration? Quite a bit, actually. Written and directed by Ronán Noone, “the smuggler” puts Tim Finnegan (Billy Meleady), an Irish immigrant, alone and center stage to tell his story and critique the idealized “American Dream.” Although at times the strict rhymed structure inhibits the show’s sincerity of Finnegan’s monologue, Meleady’s lively yet intimate expressions and boisterous storytelling still provoke sympathy for the morally questionable character as he navigates the dilemmas and sacrifices of immigrant life.
Award-winning director and writer Noone’s production of “the smuggler” will run from Nov. 7 to Nov. 24 at the Boston Playwrights’ Theatre. Around 70 minutes, the play features Tim Finnegan, a struggling Irish immigrant, who soliloquizes about the circumstances and events of his life that led him to own the very bar he stands in. On the fictional New England small town of Amity, a drunk driving accident has heightened tensions around immigrant communities, and controversy over the removal of a sycamore tree provides context for the local political scene. Against this background, Tim Finnegan describes his life as a jobless, alcoholic writer struggling to maintain his marriage and support his son. Out of desperation, Finnegan turns to theft and moral compromise, setting in motion a chain of personal justification and reckoning that both destroys and improves the lives of those around him.
The show begins with folk music, and Tim Finnegan descends the staircase into the basement of a bar, removes his coat, cracks open a beer, and sits on the black stool in the center of the stage. Meleady’s movements are exaggerated and comical, and as he begins his rhyming verse about his journey to America, his narrations seems more like an expositional theatrical monologue than intimate storytelling. However, Noone’s rhymes begin to feel natural as Finnegan’s personality, character, and flaws are revealed. Finnegan is not a lovable protagonist, his attitude is cynical and jaded, and he constantly tries to justify the mistreatment of his wife Tina and his crimes to himself. Yet Meleady’s moving expressions of true frustration and honest desperation make it difficult to entirely condemn his actions. This tension in Finnegan’s tell-all confession helps Noone express the complexity of immigrant communities on the most personal level, while still incorporating universal questions of moral compromise.
To introduce the characters of this story, from Finnegan’s mother-in-law to the mysterious “X,” Finnegan takes to attempting impressions of each to relay their dialogue. He is by nature an unreliable narrator, and pairing his bias with Meleady’s hilarious and exaggerated impressions adds an element of intimate storytelling. In the moments of greatest drama, such as a heated exchange between Tim and his wife or a confrontation between Tim and his cop brother-in-law, the rhyming aspect of the show and Meleady’s portrayal of other characters make the scenes captivating, turning a one-man performance into a drama significant to the contemporary world.
The web of relationships, secrets, and desires ultimately culminate with Tim Finnegan crossing the line, assuming the role of the smuggler and prospering. This ending, where morally-questionable actions and an immigrant-eat-immigrant mentality prevails, undermines the pedagogical face of the play, instead setting a harsh critique on the American Dream and its legacy.
In order to leave the debate and questions of ethics and morality in the spotlight, the play’s technical elements are subtle but effective. The set, a staircase leading from a well-lit door to a dirty but empty basement, is closed in by walls of red and black. Descending the staircase holds the imagery of a descent into Hell and sin, and mirrors Finnegan’s journey. Open and well-lit, the set allows Meleady to move freely, acting out dramatic moments without restraint, and heightens the confessionary aspect of his monologue.
As the play begins, the rhyming aspect of “the smuggler” seems to prevent intimacy in storytelling, but the candid portrayal of Finnegan’s flaws; Meleady’s personal, captivating performance; and the backdrop of a larger social conflict allow the play to transcend individual elements of its structure. In evoking sympathy for Tim Finnegan, Ronán Noone compellingly condemns an entirely black-and-white view of morality, immigration, and the American Dream itself.

The many elements of design –– design as art, design in service of utility, designing an exhibition –– took center stage on Nov. 5 for the Harvard Art Museum’s annual Curatorial Innovations Lecture.
Featured lecturer Paola Antonelli, senior curator of Architecture and Design at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, spoke for over an hour to a half-full but attentive Menschel Hall. Also on hand was Peter Galison, a Harvard professor of physics and history of science, who introduced Antonelli and moderated the question-and-answer session. Martha Tedeschi, director of Harvard Art Museums, spoke briefly to start the event.
Antonelli’s lecture, titled “Broken Nature and Other Design Exhibitions for the Real World,” focused on the ways design channels human behavior and society, and how to create exhibits to reflect that idea. To illustrate her points, Antonelli chronologically revisited the exhibits she herself has curated since 1995, pictures of which were projected overhead.
The first exhibitions Antonelli discussed dealt with the innovation that design promises. She mentioned her 2001 exhibition, “Workspheres,” which explored the promise of new technology to change how humans work. In this sense, Antonelli said, design captures human behavior.
“Design is about behaviors, and modifying behaviors is something that designers can do. As a curator, I can help stimulate that,” Antonelli said.
She then discussed a similar exhibit from 2008 that dealt with innovation through design, “Design and the Elastic Mind.” She stressed that it was important to her that this exhibition pointed to a “possible direction for design.”
“We don’t need to do exhibitions that are perfectly finite. Sometimes we can try new ideas,” Antonelli said. “The impact that design has on the world makes it so that whatever step we take has implications on everyone.”
Antonelli then moved to discuss the societal significance of design. Speaking about one of her exhibits that featured fashion, Antonelli examined how articles of clothing – Trayvon Martin’s hoodie or Colin Kaepernick’s jersey – came to represent the fight for social justice. Antonelli pointed next to her online exhibit “Design and Violence,” which featured objects such as a 3D-printed gun. She focused especially on how the interactive format of this exhibition lent itself to vigorous debate and discussion.
Antonelli finished by discussing at length her recently concluded exhibition in Milan, “Broken Nature.” She explained that the exhibit — which featured objects like a biodegradable pregnancy test and an apparatus to cultivate plants from an entombed body — sought to illustrate how the public can leave behind a respectful, environmentally connected legacy. Antonelli’s closing words encouraged curators to find broader meaning in their work.
“Designing exhibitions for the real world is about weaving what you do and feeling that you are working together with the people. It’s important to feel we are doing something for others and that our work goes to build a future, possibly a better one,” Antonelli said.
Antonelli’s approach to curation impressed many audience members. Vijay G. Rajkumar, an architecture graduate student at MIT, was struck by Antonelli’s notion that exhibitions have the potential “to change behavior.”
“The role of the curator [is] to design an experience that hopefully results in action beyond the walls of the museum,” he said.
Some audience members indicated they would take inspiration from Antonelli’s message. Daisy Zhang, also an architecture student at MIT, said she felt “empowered” as a student of design because Antonelli’s work demonstrated “the impact design can have on the world.”
Rajkumar also said he felt motivated by Antonelli’s work, particularly her “Broken Nature” exhibit.
“Paola expressed an urgency that we as designers need to accept as part of our profession and as our work, that it is not only important to design for today but to really consider what it might be like to design for a world after humans, how we design our departure from this world,” Rajkumar said.

Violinist Anna Luisa Volkwein and tubist Ole Heiland, both students at the Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy University of Music and Theatre in Leipzig, travelled to Boston this week to participate in the third annual Leipzig Week in Boston. Throughout the week, musicians from both the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO) and Leipzig’s Gewandhaus Orchestra (GHO) collaborated to produce a series of joint concerts and educational programs. Volkwein and Heiland, who were also both summer fellows at the Tanglewood Music Center, spoke with The Harvard Crimson about their experiences studying with two world-class orchestras and performing in the United States as German musicians.
The Harvard Crimson: Could you talk a bit about your backgrounds and careers as musicians so far?
Anna Luisa Volkwein: I started playing the violin when I was five years old. My parents are not musicians — they are hobby musicians — and I have older siblings who also played some instruments. I just wanted to play the violin, and I started to play in the youth orchestra when I was around 13, 14. That’s actually when I started to think about being a professional, or becoming a professional musician. And I went to university after graduation.
Ole Heiland: For me it’s actually quite similar. I picked up the tuba because I was a bit jealous [of] my brother because he played double bass — I wanted to play a big instrument too. I was five as well, but I didn’t start with tuba because it’s just too big for a five year old. I started with tenor horn, one of those Bavarian brass band traditional instruments.
THC: Ole, I read that you are also a jazz performer. Is that unusual in Europe?
OH: It’s a bit separate, yeah. I think most of the brass players do at some point [play] a bit of jazz. Often when you play the classical stuff, you’ll also happen to play some jazzy quintet — you start to play it, and [then] listen to it. A lot of players like to do it a bit. But, I don’t know, I didn’t try to get into jazz. It was just, like, happening, and it was like “Oh, it’s really nice and I really like it,” so I did it — since I was around fourteen or fifteen. It’s kind of strange because it is a bit separate in the education. For example, it’s kind of hard to find people in Leipzig to play with when you’re in school because the jazz faculty and the classical faculty [are] not one musical thing — which is bad, I think.
THC: You’ve both had a lot of experience playing with the GHO alone. What is it like playing in this mixed group with the BSO?
OH: It was really loud yesterday — we played a really, really loud piece! It was just one rehearsal, [but] the sounds are different, the group is playing different, and you feel that for sure. I think it just needs a few more rehearsals to get the same feeling. But it was just too short to really know — just ten minutes!
ALV: I heard from colleagues. They told me it’s really interesting, and everyone gave like 120 percent because everyone was really excited. It’s a really special thing for them.
OH: That’s true, because you don’t know the people next to you!
THC: Have you noticed any cultural or musical differences between American musicians/performers and European or German musicians/performers?
ALV: For me, I didn’t see such a big difference. Music is an international language, and we understand each other through the music. Maybe just the way of rehearsing was a bit different, but the way the strings were playing is quite similar to what I experience in Europe.
OH: There are some different sound thoughts, but that’s also in Germany or in Europe pretty different — just like a dialect, but the language is still the same.
THC: Is there anything unusual or striking about American audiences or concert etiquette?
ALV: They are more excited! In Germany, I often experience that they are really just clapping and not standing up or giving standing ovations — it’s not happening so often.
OH: But it depends on the city a bit.
ALV: Yeah, it depends on the city, on the audience, on the age of the audience. But that’s what I experience in America — they are really excited.
OH: I liked [playing] in Tanglewood — on the lawn, outside the shed — I don’t know any similar way to hear a concert [in Germany]. There are some open air concerts, but not an [indoor] concert which is also open air. Just to be there, and you can listen, you can picnic — that was cool.
ALV: I also wanted to say that the BSO — the way they welcomed us, it was so nice.
OH: That’s true.
ALV: We had a really nice reception yesterday...
OH: ...and a nice soccer game. But we won!

Tegan and Sara, the twin sister duo, are finally ready to talk about high school. While others might shy away just thinking back on it, the LGBTQ icons pored over music, journals, and film from those years — and went public with it. The result: their memoir “High School” published this past September, accompanied by a new album “Hey, I’m Just Like You.” As such, the album explores music they originally wrote during their tumultuous and explorational high school years, re-recorded. The sisters revisited the memories of their younger selves 20 years later, and their heartfelt performance at the Wilbur on Oct. 25 paid homage to this process.
The performance opened with Tegan emerging from stage right against a simple backdrop of neon light that split the stage in half, one side blue and the other yellow. A lone set piece — a bookshelf stocked with 12 thin booklets — sat center stage. Tegan began with a commentary on memory — a concept that permeated the evening. “It’s a great comfort to go through life with a witness,” Tegan said, referring to Sara, seated at the piano across the stage. With that, the lights dimmed, and Sara on piano and Tegan on guitar, the pair began their night of music with their latest album’s titular song, “Hey, I’m Just Like You.”
After the song, the two walked up to the microphones for a more official introduction. They set “ground rules,” including limiting noise during the spoken word portions of the evening and turning phones off. They emphasized that they wanted to make this year’s performances different from their previous tours.
“We’re trying to create a ‘90s, intimate space here,” Tegan said.
And that they did. The general pattern of the night consisted of spoken word by one sister in silence, sometimes accompanied by light acoustic backing, found footage from the pair’s early years, and acoustic versions of the album’s songs, with breaks indicated by the dimming of the lights. The variety of mediums breathed life and performance into the multifaceted perspective of the album and the duo’s high school years, as opposed to the limited story gleaned from just the music. Additionally, the musicians’ decision to not dichotomize the performance through only spoken word and music is ingenious — the use of multiple mediums alleviated the friction that would otherwise be present between just two opposing media. Through such a seamless delivery, Tegan and Sara immersed the audience in their coming-of-age story.
The twins used this format to cover a breadth of topics relevant to ‘90s adolescence. Tegan began by discussing sibling woes and how little she and Sara got along when they were young. Interestingly enough, drugs were the catalyst for their changed relationship.
“Sara and I, we noticed while we were high, we got along,” Tegan said. “It cracked open a creative mountain for us.”
They then spoke about euphoric discovery of music and how they both, independently of one another, became obsessed with this instinctive need to make it.
“I felt a jolt of excitement as the yellow body of a guitar revealed itself,” Tegan said, going on to talk about the long hours spent playing it. “What I didn’t know was Sara was doing the same thing when I wasn’t around.”
In a way, the whole performance is a period piece — everything the twins put together is so ‘90s. Through a patching together of spoken word, light ambient acoustic, music, and film, they transported their audience to their past lives. As the show nears its end, Tegan and Sara advised us on our own tendencies to dismiss our pasts.
“By rejecting your younger selves, you’re rejecting a big part of who your are,” Tegan said. The image of the duo’s younger selves obtained from the show is inseparable from their personas in the current, as the same is probably true for the rest of us.

The swirl of a silken sleeve. Eyes, batting behind a fan. The “Perfect Woman,” delicate as a butterfly — and not, in actuality, a woman.
On Friday, Nov. 1, “M. Butterfly,” presented by the Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club, opened at the Loeb Experimental Theater. Written by David Henry Hwang, the show originally premiered in 1988, and proceeded to win a multitude of awards, including a Tony for Best Play. Directors Shirley L. Chen ’22 and Eric J. Cheng ’20 (who also stars as the inimitable Butterfly) describe the show as “angry, raw, and fiercely critical,” a perception that shines through in their production.
In the play, a shamed French diplomat by the name of Rene Gallimard (Henry R. Lynch ’20) reflects on his life and the decisions that led him to the “four-and-a-half meters by five” French cell he finds himself occupying on counts of espionage. His story, intertwined with that of the famed Puccini opera Madame Butterfly, details his crimes — namely, treason against his country by way of an illicit affair with Beijing Opera singer Song Liling (Cheng). Gallimard calls Song “his Butterfly,” the “Perfect Woman” who turns out to be a spy for the Communist Chinese government, and a man.
Beyond the narrative on the page, however, are the darker themes that “M. Butterfly” contends with: ideas of Orientalism, differences between East and West, and the stereotypes of submissive Asian women and dominant, “cruel” white men. “M. Butterfly” does not mince words — it’s in-your-face about the issues with these types of stereotypes — but is still an incredibly complex, nuanced piece of writing that is handled with great care and understanding by the show’s cast.
Rene Gallimard is the primary narrator of the play, performing both omniscient speaker and actor in the flashbacks showing the events that transpired in his life. Lynch brings a stylized innocence to the role, convincingly articulating how and why the implausible events of Gallimard’s life came to be. His earnest explanations of his story when addressing the audience coupled with his simple charisma easily garner sympathy from the audience.
Though this is Rene Gallimard’s story, the real star of the show is Butterfly, or Song Liling, who eventually wrests narrative control of the story and becomes the speaker while Gallimard is silenced. Cheng dazzles as Butterfly, bringing a passionate anger and intelligence to the role and showcasing the critical elements of the play’s writing in its outright discussion of problematic stereotypes of the East created by the Western gaze.
This production was unique in that members of the production had the incredible opportunity to meet and work with BD Wong, the original Song Liling. For Cheng, whatever insight BD Wong imparted upon him worked: He captured the heat of Butterfly’s anger, feelings of trapped helplessness, and manipulative qualities. Along with his fellow actors, Cheng’s dedicated, energetic performed successfully animated the at times dense and dialogue heavy show.
The staging further brought the text to colorful, vibrant life, thanks to the direction of Chen and Cheng. The set is purposefully divided into East and West, with Gallimard’s cell/France/the West on the left, and Butterfly’s parlor on the right. Only Gallimard and Butterfly ever cross between sides. The center platform’s multiple uses as a traditional Chinese theater stage, an actual bed, and a judicial court creates even more nuance and meaning to how these physical locations connect in the story — the constant performativity displayed by Butterfly’s character in all locations.
Another standout aspect of the staging was the use of the balcony area. Placing actors physically above the other characters onstage immediately imbued them with authority, power, and in Butterfly’s case, otherworldliness. The scenes on the balcony thus took on a transcendent quality that was thoroughly captivating.
“M. Butterfly” is an incredibly thought provoking play that works through difficult topics of Asian identity with finesse, and asks audiences to consider their conceptions and prejudices about Asians and how they fit into the larger Western perception of the East. The production treats the original material with the utmost care, illuminating the messages between the lines of the text and placing its raw and emotional critiques on display. The show does important work in putting Asians and Asian-American identities on stage, and the creative staging and compelling acting elevate this already extraordinary story to new heights. All in all, Harvard’s performance of “M. Butterfly” is a must-see that will have audiences leaving the theater with a new perception of Asian identity.

Rex Orange County, the musical archetype of emotional adolescence, released his new album “Pony” on Oct. 25. If an artist’s third album is portentous of their longevity, “Pony” is an inauspicious omen. Like Chance the Rapper’s “Coloring Book,” it is a pleasant motley of lyrical authenticity and novel experimentation. But it is also unequivocally worse than his previous records. The problem is not that it lacks the potent grit of “bcos u will never b free” or the symphonic musicality of “Apricot Princess.” “Pony” grabs a pinch of all three, adds a bit more electricity, and then blends the musicality of the past with the newfound tools and problems of success. The ensuing potpourri is sweet at times and saccharine at others.
“It’s not the same anymore / It’s better, yeah, yeah,” he croons over an acoustic guitar in the final lines of the album, before an orchestral outro. Rex Orange County has come a long way from the bedroom floor, for sure, but at times “Pony” mistakes alteration for improvement.
The cover art suggests an album with the unreserved honesty that helped propel Mr. O’Connor from SoundCloud to stardom in a little over three years. He stands before a white background dressed in a white T-shirt and looks to the left of the camera. He has facial hair now, is no longer a teenager, and flashes a gap-toothed grin. “This is the real me, no foofaraw!” the cover art seems to scream, a message unreflected by the artificial instrumentation present in much of “Pony.”
The false promise was not without warning: “I wanted to put out this song that’s bridging the gap between “Apricot Princess” and where I’m going, as far as sound and melodies. More stripped-back,” he said in an interview with Pitchfork concerning the late 2017 single “Edition,” his first rendezvous with un-strummable electrical instruments. “I love things that are really linear and perfect and simple. Then again, that’s bullshit, because I’m still going to put out really massive songs as well.” The unreconciled tension between his aphorist aims and gaudy inclinations is the defining feature of “Pony.”
In “Every Way,” he strips away any ostentatious instrumental flair, extolling immeasurable affection with his voice, a piano, and a few soft organ touches. “Apricot Princess,” with its orchestral opening and jazz interlude “Rain Man,” more effectively channels the productive ethos of Queen’s “A Night at the Opera” than “Pony,” but the opening chords of “Every Way” are straight from Queen’s timeless ballad “Love of My Life.” No one will ever match Freddie Mercury’s vocals, but O’Connor’s sonic love letter to his girlfriend, Thea, is heartfelt and honest. “No one prepares you for the way in which things change / But you’ve been amazing, saw me through my darkest stage,” he serenades, slowly emphasizing the powerful closing words of each line. “I cry in front of you and it’s very necessary babe,” he publicly reveals in the penultimate line. The tears are audible.
“Never Had the Balls” is comparatively silent. Sure, it completes the line “Never had the / I’ve never had the” from “Face to Face” with bird chirps and droning synths and two types of guitars and a drum kit and many versions of the same voice, but emotion is muffled in the mix. Sure, the head-bopping rhythm communicates some of the song’s sentiment — especially the message that Rex Orange County is happily homeward bound — but his elation is not as palpably human as it was in the closing track of his last album, “Happiness.”
“Pony” is at its best when it avoids the seductions of the Sony studio and refuses to let expensive instrumentation hide its heart. The patina of Rex Orange County’s precipitous rise helps congeal its electrical cracks, but the album isn’t green anymore.

Book titles generally do a good job of encapsulating their contents, but few are as on the nose as “Little Weirds,” Jenny Slate’s memoir (of sorts). The book is composed of many chapters for such a slim volume, most of which live up to the weirdness Slate promises. Slate’s voice, unfiltered and unpolished, meanders through the strange thoughts that everyone’s brain produces. Even in the most irreverent moments, Slate’s writing gives the reader a clear understanding of how she thinks and who she is — precisely what the book sets out to do.
Slate writes like she performs her stand-up comedy — for which she is better known — full of starts and stops and circles until she finally addresses it head-on. It’s refreshing, however, to get such a voice so clearly in each of her short vignettes. In these moments, the frenetic energy of Missy, her character on “Big Mouth” shines through.
Slate focuses a great deal on the house she grew up in, referring to it over and over again. She even revives the New England Mobile Book Fair, a once-thriving, now dilapidated bookstore that puts any Barnes & Noble to shame in terms of size and variety of books sold. (Thanks to Amazon, it has considerably shrunk in size, but loyal fans still flock to it to find something they might not otherwise see in a national chain store.) Though “Little Weirds” often veers off into the abstract, it remains grounded in the places that have touched Slate, such as her home, Norway, and the plant shop.
Arguably the best chapters are those that have a concrete narrative. One of these is entitled “A Prayer,” and the entire chapter is one line: “As the image of myself becomes sharper in my brain and more precious, I feel less afraid that someone else will erase me by denying me love.” The best kind of writing is the kind that both makes readers pause and think, succinctly identifying a particular thought or feeling. Slate has done that with this one sentence.
The book is a metaphorical wandering through the expansive meadow that is one’s brain, but Slate nevertheless manages to have razor-sharp insight that can be taken beyond the confines of the book. Many of us have forgotten what it’s like to have an intimate connection to nature, but Slate reminds us that “information about art and nature feels like the best stuff to have, and if you have it, it is powerful and excellent to pass it on. That is an act of power, showing what you know, giving it to another person.”
Without telling her audience to take care of themselves, she basically tells them to do so (take note, Harvard students!). Near the end of the book, she writes, “it occurs to me that if anyone ever bullies me again I will warn them one time but probably start to stop loving them, and that if they do it again I will have my final, that a person who does that to me does not love me.”
The most poignant chapter was “To Norway,” in which she — not surprisingly — goes to Norway and does what she does best: observe others. One of her subjects is a woman who nonchalantly orders a hot dog, something that Slate thinks would comparatively be weird for an American woman to do. The chapter contains a beautiful description of her breakfast: a simple list of what she ate, but with an air of appreciation suggesting that she viewed the meal as more than just a meal. Slate exemplifies the beauty of observation.
Her musings on Hammurabi as the first patriarch inspire a pause too. Slate doesn’t necessarily say it, but rather floats the possibility of what it would be like if to undo 2,000 years of convention. Actually, the entire book does that: Is it possible to embrace the little rabbit holes of the human brain, and truly explore what’s there?

Eight years after the publication of “The Night Circus,” Erin Morgenstern returns to the spotlight to herald the release of her second novel, “The Starless Sea.”
On the night of its publication, fans of Morgenstern’s work flocked to the auditorium at the Coolidge Corner School in Brookline, Mass., to hear her speak. Liberty Hardy, a critic on the online platform “Book Riot,” host of the podcast “All the Books,” and reader of 300-400 books a year, mediated the discussion.
Brookline Booksmith, a local indie bookstore, hosted the event, and aptly so. When Morgenstern first published “The Night Circus” in 2011, Brookline Booksmith held her release party.
Her new novel, “The Starless Sea,” features an enchanted underground library and a graduate student named Zachary Ezra Rawlins. The book is layered — it features stories within stories, fables and fairytales interspersed within the pages of a larger novel.
It took Morgenstern eight years to write and publish another book. When Hardy mentioned the prodigious success of “The Night Circus,” Morgenstern expressed more discomfort than pride.
“It’s equal parts delightful and terrifying,” Morgenstern said.
The success of her debut did not spur Morgenstern on to prolificity. Rather, Morgenstern confessed that the fame and fortune of her first bestseller — accompanied by a host of avid fans clamoring for more and a cohort of unfettered critics — made her artistic progress difficult.
In fact, “The Night Circus” took five years to write, the finished product of a work first started in November of 2005 during National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo), an online challenge that asks writers to produce 50,000 words in a month. The initial draft included a sizable amount of circus imagery but did not include the main character, Celia, and the final copy did not hit shelves until September of 2011.
“I’m never going to be a book-a-year person,” Morgenstern said.
Still, Morgenstern admitted that she was glad that “The Night Circus” required the kind of revision and effort that it did. She added that “The Starless Sea” required a similar process of extensive edits and reimagining.
“I have to write it wrong to write it right,” Morgenstern said.
Morgenstern began the hour-long discussion with Hardy by speaking about her artistic process. She did not create the character of Zachary, she asserted; rather, the character came to her.
“I have this weird thing that happens where I just have people in my head. It’s a little disconcerting sometimes, actually,” Morgenstern said.
But before she ever creates a character, Morgenstern begins her books with “spaces.” She has the backdrop before the proverbial actors ever strut onto the stage. Before Morgenstern ever coaxed Celia and Marco, the protagonists of “The Night Circus,” to life, she had the circus. Before Zachary appeared in her head, she had the sprawling, underground library that defines “The Starless Sea.”
In fact, Morgenstern revealed that she doesn’t particularly like circuses. In “The Night Circus,” she created the kind of circus that she would have liked to visit: a magical, otherworldly space of performative art. In the library of “The Starless Sea,” she brought to life what she calls “the ideal introvert space.” She builds her novels around what she calls “curating” an “ideal fantasy space.” She said that while some people thought of fantasy as escapism, she preferred to think of it as “interesting travel.”
These ideal spaces have made for a devoted group of fans. During the portion of the discussion in which audience members asked questions, one woman stood up and confessed that the imagery of “The Night Circus” was so fantastic that, when she raised a newborn baby, she felt as if she were going out every night to the circus as she stayed at home.
Before the event began, outside the auditorium, members of the show lined up for a block and a half on the sidewalk. Some of them were longtime fans of “The Night Circus” and knew it well.
“I was amazed by [‘The Night Circus.’] I really liked the descriptions in the book, especially of the circus itself,” Emily Swanson, a Boston resident, said.
Others, who regularly frequented author events, expressed their appreciation for Morgenstern’s insights on her work.
“I really like hearing from an author their perspective on their work. I think you get another added layer of depth you don’t get from just reading their work on the page,” Katie Schneider, another Boston resident, said.
Still others were writers, hoping to learn about craft.
“I read ‘The Night Circus’ back when it came out and thought it was really richly envisioned and a really lovely book. I’m actually a writer, and I’m interested in hearing her talk about her process and what it’s like to be a first-time novelist,” writer and audience member Diana Doty said.

It’s only when you encounter a novel lacking in complex characters, plot, and motive that you realize how vital those things are. Without them, the story is dead.
Of course, if you like this kind of thing, Erin Morgenstern’s sophomore offering “The Starless Sea” will appeal to you. She sweetens the pot with endless descriptions of cups, libraries, rooms, and paintings to make up for the lack of her characters’ direction. It’s doubly disappointing to encounter these glaring issues in her second novel, because they are the same problems that plagued her first release, “The Night Circus.”
Because the characters lack motivation and cosmic desires beyond “wanting to tell their story,” it’s difficult to truly ascertain what happens in “The Starless Sea,” but the general premise is this: Zachary Ezra Rawlins studies Emerging Media at what feels like a fictional Ivy League school in Vermont. He discovers an odd book that uses part of his own life as the plot, leading him down a rabbit hole to figure out the book’s origins. He soon ends up at a costume party, the events at which initiate him into a world of aesthetic intrigue and opulent beauty.
The above is truly the most accurate plot summary possible, because to say anything more would be mere conjecture. A secret sea exists under the earth in the world Zachary finds himself, but why it’s there is unclear. It’s also made of honey, presumably to tie in with the bee, sword, and key imagery strewn throughout the book, but, again, why these symbols are vital and how they tie into the much-needed backstory is never provided to the reader.
Unfortunately, this novel also suffers from problems at the semantic and syntactic levels. Dialogue is followed by qualifiers like “if buttressed is a word.” This kind of indecisiveness is sloppy and distracting, especially since an omniscient narrator tells the story.
Morgenstern, to her credit, spends a great deal of time crafting a visual world, with the result being that many objects are overwrought. For example, she describes “a larger light above is not a chandelier at all but a cluster of glowing globes hung amongst brass hoops and bars.” As a layperson without any claims to chandelier expertise, it seems like this “larger light” is literally the description of a chandelier.
This sloppiness weighs down her prose, making it difficult to discern what is important and what is not. It lends her a seemingly masterful air, and thus a reader might defer to her authority because they do not understand what’s happening. Newsflash: If you, as a reader, don’t understand the prose because everything seems unconnected and intentionally vague, it’s not you — it’s the author.
The novel’s narrative tense is problematic as well. Morgenstern writes in third person present: “Dorian smiles at the statement, despite the truth of it or because of it.” The present tense is jarring from the first sentence of the novel all the way to the very last. It also serves no functional purpose in the book because it doesn’t even ostensibly provide narrative urgency.
At times, it is shocking that the novel made it past proofreaders and editors. The following is not a sentence: “In the bottom of the wardrobe there are several pairs of shoes and of course they fit, which bothers him more than the clothing since most of it is loose-fitting and adjustable, everything fits but that could be explained away by him on the slim side of standard but the shoes are scary.” That multiple people green-lighted this, is, quite frankly, appalling.
Morgenstern seems to have decided that metaphor, not plot, would be the story’s foundation. Unfortunately, metaphors require points of reference, and when the concrete images presented to the reader are all reduced to metaphors, the reader must them ask herself, “what is the real thing that’s happening here?” Unfortunately, because Morgenstern can’t be bothered with making choices about why things happen in the novel, she doesn’t know either.
Thus, “The Starless Sea” is roughly 500 pages of beautiful images that create no cohesive whole. The characters are not motivated to do anything beyond wander in and out of worlds — we don’t know why they’re connected or why this universe is truly imperiled — which comes as no surprise, because Morgenstern also fails to flesh out any of her characters beyond vague origin stories that are nothing more than filler. The characters are so loosely sketched that they have no real reason to do anything until the next image of a bee crops up.
To that end: Morgenstern never clarifies the purpose of the bee, the sword, the key, or the crown. Are these images remnants of an old society? Possibly, but they appear as tattoos, etchings, images on dice, and actual objects, and it’s difficult to tell why they do. Every single element of this story has no “why” underpinning it, which is particularly important in fantasy.
Morgenstern might disdain worldbuilding, yet for fantastical novels such as this one, in which the stakes are different and the terms set by the limits and extent of the world itself, worldbuilding is absolutely vital. Ignoring it results in a novel that has no stakes, no tension, no purpose, and, crucially, no intrigue. The lack of plot becomes almost insulting considering that Morgenstern herself admitted in an interview that she has trouble with it: Perhaps putting the brakes on indulgent descriptions of libraries to determine where the book is going would have been a good use of her time.
The only discernible villain dies early on, resolving nothing. The characters continue to wander — and no wonder, because Morgenstern never gave them any reason to do otherwise. It might be annoying to do as an author, but even within an unreal world, the characters, plot, and setting have to provide a logical answer to “why” things exist and occur the way they do. The reader never receives an answer, because Morgenstern is content to ask vague questions couched as answers — they’re “metaphors,” but for what, no one knows — assigning the reader instead to the task of answering. This demand inverts the relationship between reader and author, rendering the process of reading unenjoyable and purposeless.
Morgenstern appears to create a metanarrative about why we tell stories, how we tell them, who gets to keep them, where they go, and how we get lost in them. These are weighty, thought-provoking themes, worthy of exploration, but given that “The Starless Sea” is not a personal essay, but rather a large work of fiction, it is not too much to ask for concrete plot, detailed character desires, and backstory to serve as a foundation for attempted answers to those questions. Unfortunately, these three elements are basic, vital, and, crucially, absent from this novel.

This episode focuses mainly on two things: one of the most convoluted plot lines in recent “Riverdale” memory — the legal proceedings of the Lodge family — and the other one of the most hokey — Betty’s “serial killer” genes. The result is a mildly boring episode with the usual nonsense thrown in. It’s almost completely irrelevant, until the end when the episode flashes forward to show FP Jones (Skeet Ulrich) bursting into a classroom to accuse Betty (Lili Reinhart), Veronica (Camila Mendes), and Archie (KJ Apa) of murdering Jughead (Cole Sprouse).
“Riverdale” can’t decide how seriously it wants to take the Lodge family. On the one hand, Hiram Lodge (Mark Consuelos) is a scary mob boss who means business. On the other, are viewers really meant to believe that Veronica, a senior in high school, somehow owns a not-so-secret secret speak-easy underneath the local diner? Also, that she has the power to blackmail the state governor? Veronica says it herself, “Goals for this week: Get Mommy out of jail and make sure Daddy stays rotting in his.” And she has two papers due this week! The life of a Lodge is hard.
It gets even harder when it becomes clear that her mom, Hermione Lodge (Marisol Nichols), is guilty of the crimes she’s being charged for. They found her monogrammed Tucci bag (you read that right) full of money where Tall Boy Petite — the extremely poorly named would-be murderer from last season — was staying. Hermione can’t catch a break, because Hiram has called his other daughter (who viewers are just as surprised as Veronica is to find out about) to help clear his name. It’s unclear why the newly introduced Hermosa Lodge (Mishel Prada) is so eager to help Hiram, after being completely ignored by him for years.
But the truly ridiculous is yet to come. Betty has started taking classes in the Junior FBI program with Kevin (Casey Cott), only to realize she is able to identify a serial killer just by their picture. She’s able to do so not by their smell or their actions, but by picture alone, which feels like a slippery slope into profiling. She confirms with her doctor that she does, in fact, have the “serial killer” genes MAOA and CDH13, supposedly inherited from her father. Then, she starts to have an existential crisis.
Suddenly, repressed memories come to light. There is a flashback to when she hallucinated a second version of herself, who said, “Betty, we both know that we drowned Caramel.” Betty now remembers killing her childhood cat: First, she remembers hitting Caramel over the head with a rock; then, she remembers her serial killer father made her do it because the cat was suffering after being hit by a car. Certainly a traumatic event, but not necessarily an indicator that Betty is a future serial killer.
But, let us not forget that “Riverdale” showed us a flashback mentioning drowning then completely decided to change the script to fit their whims. They do so again when Charles (Wyatt Nash), Betty’s half-brother, reveals that he too has the serial killer genes. The problem is, he’s Betty’s half-brother through her mother, not her serial killer father. Once again, the plot holes widen. Unfortunately, it appears that “Riverdale” is going to run with this. Suddenly Betty is suspicious. She tells Kevin, “Forget ‘Is Charles gay or straight?’ I’m interested in ‘Is he a serial killer or not?’” Is this somehow connected to the VHS tapes from Episode Three? Or are we just forgetting about that?
Archie’s plot line continues to follow his battle against street gang leader Dodger (Juan Riedinger), which is so boring it barely deserves a mention. However, there is one scene where Dodger and Archie face off — Archie tells him to scram, Dodger pulls out a gun — and in the background there is a full-fledged dumpster fire, which feels a pretty apt description for this entire subplot.
Jughead is also struggling at boarding school, reveling in the opportunities of Stonewall Prep but facing bullying for being the only student in the class on scholarship. There’s some competition to ghostwrite a book for a series he’s loved since childhood, which is somehow tangentially connected to his grandfather. This could turn into a fun story, or it could get lost amid the nonsense. Time will tell.
All in all, “Riverdale” has failed — five episodes in — to establish exactly why viewers should be watching Season Four. No overarching problem has been identified and the episodes feel like an amalgamation of tying up loose ends and introducing lukewarm tensions between characters.

In spite of its impressive casting and promising Shakespearean roots, Netflix’s new retelling of young Prince Hal’s rise to the throne in “The King” is nothing short of humorless and grim. The story of the dilatory prince (Timothée Chalamet) has none of the joviality found in the Bard’s famously inaccurate, but much lauded depiction of history in the Henriad. Director David Michod’s film is all darkness to its core. This grimness is at times effective, but overwhelmingly bleak to the point that it does not leave room for other traits to shine and distract from the real issue: a major of lack in-depth character development. In spite of the vast number of central characters, Henry (who drops his nickname after he ascends the throne) is the only character that actually changes over the course of the film — which does not say all that much considering how little he does develop.
In this movie, Hal’s wild tramps through Eastcheap are never painted in a joyous light. While Shakespeare’s text his excursions are the way he gets to know the common people and thus become this beloved King of England (or so the Bard portrays), they hardly serve the same purpose in Michod’s vision. Rather, Hal’s London life is shown to be a constant desire for numbing and forgetting his roots. In one of the most disturbing shots of the film, the noise from the tavern is dialed down to a single screech while the future leader gets blind drunk and laughs hysterically at the goings on around him. There is nothing funny about this moment. Hal is never presented as a man who likes to have fun: Rather, he is a man who has purposely lost himself in a world diametrically opposite to the one he grew up in due to fierce disapproval of the court’s Machiavellian nature. He spends his evening in this manner due to extreme guilt he feels about his mad father’s decisions, which have cost innocent lives and close allies.
Hal stumbles onto the throne out of necessity, somewhat convinced by his best friend and former war hero John Falstaff (Joel Edgerton). Yet Hal’s ascent to the throne in this film is as unconvincing as Chalamet’s English accent. He has no real drive, merely a reluctant duty that stems from frustration with the world around him. Hal knows that he cannot recover England to its former glory, which is why he is so reluctant to attack France or to make any political moves. Nonetheless, he gets lost in the politics around him in spite of his understanding of the uselessness of war. The film’s tragedy is watching him walk into the hands of others.
As much as it is a historical film, “The King” is also a psychological dive into the mind of a man riddled with doubts and self-hatred. In spite of his troubling accent, Chalamet captures this self-loathing and confusion incredibly well. His careful acting, however, does not stop the role itself from being rather alienating considering how much brooding his character does. Henry has no other emotions. Unfortunately, Chalamet is clearly uncomfortable with the English accent since he only ever whispers or yells his lines. In the end, this might be more reflective of the unconvincing dialogue. This is most evident with Henry’s supposedly stirring, but rather silly nationalist speech to his troops at Agincourt. There is absolutely no comparison between this and Shakespeare’s rousing and iconic St. Crispin’s Day speech. Not that the film is meant to be based on Shakespeare’s work, but are we really supposed to believe that Chalamet repeatedly screaming “Make it England” about the battleground will spur these men to victory?
Though he plays a rather minimal role, Robert Pattinson is oddly delightful as the Dauphin. His accent is so unnecessarily thick and abrasive, that it is absolutely ridiculous — and yet somehow it works? When paired with his vicious cadences, the hefty French verbiage might not convince (especially in comparison to real French actor Thibault de Montalembert’s speech), but certainly entertains. It also cannot take away from how well Pattinson plays a foolish, mad man. Hal’s first confrontation with the Dauphin is equally terrifying and hilarious, and all credit goes to Pattinson for playing this savage beast so perfectly.
Sadly, as hard as he tries, Joel Edgerton cannot bring the same spirit to Falstaff, a character so popular Shakespeare had to write a spin-off play about him. Edgerton plays Falstaff with just the right amount of spirit, but the issue is that in this version Falstaff does not have much of a character. For this reason, it is difficult to feel any sympathy towards him when he loses his best friend. Even his death does not feel all that poignant. Like many of the most important characters of the film, such as the secret plotter William Gascoigne (Sean Harris), he is forgettable.
What the film lacks in character development, however, it makes up for in gorgeous cinematography, an exquisite set, and lavish costume design. The choreography involved in the battle scene at Agincourt in particular is simply stunning and so effectively filmed, bringing to life the claustrophobia of combat. The senselessness and violence is heartbreakingly portrayed with close up, silent shots. Without any sound, the battle is rendered absurd. And at the end of the day, in a story about the danger of war, this emphasis on absurdity is what really matters.
While it might have some redeeming qualities, the film cannot recover from its glaring issues. Its technical assets put their best foot forward, but cannot save a film that ultimately merited a good rewrite and different less nihilistic vision. Re-working a story as beloved and as historical as that of “Henry V” requires a lot more than just great cinematography.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lorde recently announced in an email to her newsletter subscribers that her unofficially announced upcoming album will be postponed because of the death of her dog, Pearl. She revealed that she had been working on new music in her home country of New Zealand, and that her adoption of Pearl in 2018 made her life “grow exponentially,” and he “brought an immeasurable amount of joy and purpose” into her world. He was also a muse for her — “he led me towards the ideas,” she lamented in the email. Unfortunately, Pearl suffered from various ailments in his life, and even with medication and help from specialists in October, he died after two cardiac arrests. Lorde called the loss of Pearl “indescribably painful,” saying that “a light that was turned on for [her] has gone out.” As she grieves Pearl, Lorde is asking her fans to understand that the release of her next album will be delayed.
Lorde’s statement has prompted many different responses on the Internet. Some of her fans empathize with her loss on Twitter and believe it will enhance her next album with more emotionally driven “sad songs.” Some find her reaction to the death of a pet overdramatic, and still other fans are unsympathetic because they want new music released as soon as possible. The majority of people, though, seem to be supportive and understanding of her grieving process, and many pet owners are especially empathetic, like one fan who said via Twitter, “my dog is an extremely bright spot in my life. I feel for her a lot and she deserves nothing but the best.”
Lorde’s open letter to her fans about Pearl is similar to her music in its honesty and emotional transparency. Lorde boldly bares her soul in this email, evocatively describing what her relationship with Pearl meant to her. While this honesty is partly what prompted some of the aforementioned negative reactions, it is also what makes her such a relatable and captivating artist. Without debilitating fear that her loss was insignificant compared to other losses, or that her fans would be disappointed by the album delay, she articulated her current heartbreak with commendable candor. She is ultimately helping to perpetuate a culture of empathy and emotional literacy in our society, especially among celebrities, whose lives are often viewed as perfect and transcendent of negative emotions.
“So I’m asking for your patience, as 2020 rolls around and you start to wonder where the next record is. I have lost my boy, and I need some time to see the good again, to finish making this for you,” she wrote at the end of her email. She continued by saying that she needs to let the loss “crystallize” inside of her. Considering her heartfelt description of the important role Pearl played in her personal and creative ventures, the delay of her next album is understandable. It’s safe to say that as long as Lorde remains her earnest and vulnerable self, it’s more than likely that her true fans will allow her all the time she needs to heal and create again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Oct. 14, in what some might call a Major Flex™, the Disney+ Twitter account blessed its attentive observers with a deluge of movies and shows that will be available for consumption when the seven-dollar-per-month streaming service goes live on Nov. 12. A few of its available options are original, but the majority are from Disney’s incomparable archive.
Today, I scrolled through the last few dozen tweets for a few minutes, and then, exasperated with my seeming lack of progress, rapidly thumbed through decades of Disney in reverse. My variegated reactions to the images and titles on the list, indubitably colored by nostalgia and “remake” fatigue, can be essentialized into three groups: “Wait, what?”, “This sh*t is how old?”, and “I miss my Mommy.”
“Wait, what?” 
“Wait, what?” 
There are bad titles, and then there is “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series.” I doubt the new series will be as sexy as some good ol’ Zac Efron, Corbin Bleu, and Vanessa Hudgens, but it would have to be worse than “The Last Airbender” to live up to its name.
Bad titles seem to be a long-standing Disney weakness. In 1972 the ailment was particularly pronounced, with “Justin Morgan Had a Horse” and “The Biscuit Eater” managing to slip through the cracks in the same 12 months. Not to be ignored, “The Cat From Outer Space” (1978), “Mr. Boogedy” (1986), and “The Secret of The Magic Gourd” (2007) are a few other films with names that border on self-parody.
Titles, though, are not all that stupefied me during my Twitter scrolling. I was shocked at how ridiculously antiquated and borderline insensitive the cover art of several of the older films was. “Swiss Family Robinson” (1940), which I have never seen and likely never will, has a poster so pasty and profuse with bad hairdos that it would shock a titter out of a closing prosecutor. It is, however, an above average film, according to IMDB. “Davy Crockett: King of the Wild Frontier” (1955), on the other hand, appears a bit too Brian Kemp-meets-Manifest Destiny for my liking.
“This sh*t is how old?” 
“This sh*t is how old?” 
The first two titular raindrops in the Disney+ downpour were “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” (1937) and “Pinocchio” (1940). I watched both of these films back in the days when applesauce and Disney ruled my afternoons instead of homework, but I had no idea that they were older than my grandpa.
Most Disney movies were, in fact, produced before I blessed the world with my presence. Other classics like “The Jungle Book” (1967), “Peter Pan” (1953), and “Dumbo” (1941) are also much older than I previously thought. I guess I never really looked at release dates as a kid.
Films like these have shaped generations past and present, and will continue to shape the prepubescent days of those to come (and the adult ones, for those like me). On one hand, it fashions a widely accessible form of magic. On the other, it inoculates each group of new observers with the thinly veiled social messages coded into many of Disney’s films, manifested, for example, in the crows in “Dumbo,” the hyenas in “The Lion King,” and the dialect of the monkeys in “The Jungle Book.” The very first Disney cartoon was, afterall, to the tune of song straight from a Minstrel show. 
“I miss my Mommy.” 
“I miss my Mommy.” 
College is tough, but nothing makes me miss my mom like “The Lion King,” which we watched together several times in both cinematic and theatrical form. Homesickness and nostalgia hit me hard scrolling through titles like “The Incredibles” (2004), “Ratatouille” (2007), and “Meet the Robinsons” (2007) as well.
To rehash the collective magic of Disney Movies mentioned above, rewatching some of these movies with friends might be a cool way to connect with one another or to others who are different from you. Not everyone will have watched them, but it is probably more likely that an English major and a Chemistry major are interested in “The Incredibles” than in each other’s classes.
Some aspects of Disney+, like “The Mandalorian,” look promising, and many others not quite. One thing is for certain though: Disney has not deviated far from its tried and true formula for success.

In our daily lives, much has changed in the past 20 years. Instead of streaming a movie on Netflix or Amazon Prime, you would drive to Blockbuster to rent — heaven forbid — a VHS! In 1999, if you had a cellphone you probably played Snake on your Nokia device. Now, you can play thousands of games while texting your friends and calling your parents.
Despite these monumental cultural changes, some things are eerily similar. Such indistinguishable change plagues American foreign policy.
Twenty years ago, if you picked up the November/December 1999 issue of Foreign Affairs, to get an annual subscription, you would have read the following headlines: “The Fall Guy: Washington’s Self-Defeating Assault on the U.N.”; “Understanding Taiwan: Bridging the Perception Gap”; “The Taliban: Exporting Extremism”; and “Saving NATO’s Foundation.” Had titles been reprinted in this month’s edition of Foreign Affairs, few would have noticed the difference.
The similarities, however, extend beyond 20 years. Last week marked the 40th  anniversary of the 1979 hostage crisis, where Iranian protesters seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. Shortly after the hostage crisis, Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, called America “the Great Satan, the wounded snake” as Iranians in the crowd shouted, “Death to America.” Four decades later, the rhetoric remains unchanged. This week, the commander of the Iranian army, General Abdolrahim Mousavi, stood in front of the American embassy, known as the “U.S. Den of Espionage” and called the U.S. a “scorpion.”
Actions from both sides remain unchanged. The U.S. and Iran continue to antagonize each other, except for a temporary respite in 2015, when both sides signed the nuclear deal. But now, that rapprochement is all but dead. While Iran is far from innocent, the U.S. could have done a better job handling this adversary by reframing its assumptions and strategies. It should realistically appraise the Iranian threat. As Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon recently noted, “[i]n balance-of-power terms, Washington’s obsession with Tehran is absurd” since the U.S. overwhelms Iran on nearly all military metrics.
Knowing that Iran lacks the revisionist vigor from 40 years ago, Washington should seek constructive engagement and negotiation with Tehran as it has done with Moscow in the 1980s and countless other “evil empires” and ruthless regimes. If the U.S. wants to stop Iran’s nuclear program while promoting Gulf stability, the Trump team should stop relying on a “maximum pressure” strategy that is based on Peter Schweizer’s 1994 book Victory, which argues that Reagan’s “maximum pressure” ended the Soviet Union. Especially since Trump’s approach to Iran “has little in common with the carefully calibrated approach… Reagan actually took toward the Soviet Union.”
This past Saturday also marked 30 years since the Berlin Wall fell, which “ushered in the end of communism and national reunification” and signaled the end of the Soviet Union. At the time, President George H.W. Bush had discussed a “New World Order” where the “nations of the world, East and West, North and South, can prosper and live in harmony.” His national security adviser, General Brent Scowcroft, envisioned a global system that was built “out of the collapse of the US-Soviet antagonisms.” In short, the fall of the wall signified a victory for liberal democracy. This triumph has been short-lived.
Even though the Soviet collapse signaled America’s “unipolar moment,” unlike in 1945, when the U.S. sought to restructure geopolitical institutions to build a world order of peace and prosperity, the post-1989 America just assumed the rest of the world would naturally fall in line with the ongoing order. Except it did not. Putin’s revanchist Russia has reignited East-West tensions, Britain has separated itself with Brexit, authoritarianism is on the rise in Europe and elsewhere, and the United States keeps looking inward.
Since the end of the Cold War, American foreign policy has been driven by complacency. We either fail to develop a strategy — and just assume everything will work out — as with Europe. Or, we just re-apply some old Cold War strategy that doesn’t quite apply, as with Iran. This laziness has obstructed peace and the creation of a world order similar to one the elder Bush had envisioned.
Change for the sake of change is not always good, but when our foreign policy relies on the same methods, assumptions, and strategies — with few positive results — then it is time to reinvent our foreign policy. A mentor once told me that each person only has two good ideas in their professional career — I hope a country has a few more than two.
But perhaps not. I, too, am part of the problem. As I wrote this column, which criticizes America’s unimaginative foreign policy, I stumbled upon an article in that same November 1999 issue of Foreign Affairs by Johns Hopkins Professor Robert W. Tucker. In it, Tucker writes that “the world has changed profoundly… Americans remain tied to a past that has become largely irrelevant, prisoners of ideas and policies developed in the long encounter with the Soviet Union.” Little has changed in U.S.-Iranian relations since 1979. Europe today shares many similarities with Europe from 1989. And, through it all, criticisms of U.S. foreign policy in 1999 are nearly identical to the criticism I am offering today. We can all do better.

Before arriving on campus months ago, sitting around a campfire in Vermont a week before orientation, other people from an outdoor program designed to integrate freshmen into Harvard scared the hell out of me. They told me they love programs like these because they get to meet a bunch of people who don’t hate Harvard yet.
It’s not like I hadn’t heard about the complicated relationship undergraduates had with the College. This place has a reputation. I was warned by my former boss not to be changed by “those Harvard people.” Yet, nevertheless, in the first few days, Harvard life had already begun to affect me. Caffeine, little sleep, and forced handshakes leveraged by an incessant need for everyone to remake and “find” themselves in college make for an insufferable combination of fake niceties and anxiety.
I’m from Palo Alto, but I hadn’t ever heard of the Stanford Duck syndrome until my second day of orientation. The Stanford Duck syndrome is a model that portrays students at elite institutions as seemingly calm on the surface but incessantly paddling below the water. Since the second day of orientation, the Stanford Duck syndrome has become a touchpoint in conversation on sleep, social affiliation, and midterms ad absurdum.
Unfortunately, I’m not much of a duck. My tense, breathful paddling is clearly apparent. I’m two weeks late on a response paper, my midterm was moved up a week, and I don’t think I’m impressing my teaching fellows. Discovering assignments I had no idea existed is becoming a worryingly routine hobby. While this level of total ineptitude is unlikely being repeated on a massive scale, we freshmen all swim in the same waters.
Still, before these first few weeks, my characteristic old-manliness left me partial to that notion that “today’s” college students were winners or quitters. Real growth only comes through doses of suffering. Without pain, how can we be expected to change?
On a recent phone call, my dad echoed this notion. He said something to the effect of “lean into the miserableness.” Indeed, I am learning from the “miserableness.” But I still wonder though Harvard is a campus of students predisposed to the adage “no pain no gain,” do we need to accept that misery is of inherent value?
In my mind, accepting that conclusion results in a kind of life I have no interest in leading. Growth ought not to be tied up in a need for self-inflicted pain. That kind of association is kryptonite to the many a burned-out consultant or hedge fund manager. Misery is a means and never an end. Misery can help you change, but you change because you don’t want to be miserable anymore.
It seems to me that this campus valorizes the opposite. So many of us choose to go onto live lives that require perpetual sacrifice for a future that will never arrive. Sacrifice is not bad. One can sacrifice in the name of public service, making sure one’s children grow up in a household that can give them a good life, or for the freedom that money provides. The flawed thinking comes when one sacrifices for an outcome that never materializes. Happiness, positive change, or freedom are ends. Misery is but one of many means. Only ends have inherent value.
There are several things the College can do to realign academic priorities and promote growth without misery.
Freshmen often struggle unduly in the mixed class course even though they can grasp the concepts and do the work. The disconnect stems from an easily explained difference between how college and high school courses are taught. Predominantly freshmen courses often have optional introductory meetings for new students like “Surviving Gov 20.” Mixed class courses should do the same. A sophomore who had previously taken a given course could touch on what they wish they had known going into X, Y, or Z course in no more than an hour lecture and Q&A.
While I have had a very positive experience with my freshman adviser, I’ve not heard the same from many of my classmates. The role of the freshman adviser ought to be extended from an individual with whom a freshmen meets once a semester in order to receive an electronic signature, to one who actually advises. Only faculty who have time to meet with freshmen at least three times a semester should be freshman advisors. Students should be encouraged to send a list of classes they’re interested in ahead of a first meeting.
Still, I have lingering doubts. Perhaps, I’m just a complainer and a year from now today's pain will make tomorrow's familiarity with it a useful adjustment tool. The argument remains that some degree of perpetual dissatisfaction or pain leads to continual self-improvement. As we are, by nature, imperfect individuals, this seems desirable. Yet, on balance, it seems that life is far from lacking in the department of pain. It produces enough misery to promote self-improvement without the College adding on.

When undergraduates vote in the Undergraduate Council presidential election this week, they can also vote on two referenda: a submission by Divest Harvard calling on the University to disclose its holdings in the fossil fuels industry, commit to divestment, and reinvest more sustainably by Earth Day 2020, and a submission proposing to extend the closing times of breakfast and dinner by half an hour in Harvard University Dining Services facilities.
So what of these two referenda? To the first we say, “Ay!” We have previously called for Harvard to “disclose, divest, and reinvest.” As such, we support the referendum submitted by Divest Harvard and hope, perhaps vainly, that the University take this call seriously. As for extending mealtimes and proportionally increasing payment for HUDS employees, we believe that the issue cannot be constructively addressed by a mere referendum, which does not deal with the logistics of implementation.
But regardless of our specific takes on these referenda, we are skeptical of using UC referendum as a platform for change in the first place. Over the years, variations of the divest referendum have been proposed and passed by a wide margin. In 2012, 72 percent of the student body voted in favour of a divestment referendum, and last year, 71.5 percent of the student body once again voted in favour of a divestment referendum. Neither, evidently, has made much change.
As the current UC cabinet ends its tenure, this divestment referendum will no doubt join the ranks of other overwhelmingly passed, but not realized goals: saving “Harvard Time” and extending Thanksgiving Break in 2017, and repealing sanctions on single gender social organizations in 2016. Moreover, by associating itself with the, to say the least, ineffectual UC referendum process, the Divest Harvard campaign has reduced its activism to a level occupied by banning student meetings during breakfasts, making the Harvard Turkey the official mascot of the University, and transforming the Pusey Library into a social space.
Though some may still see the UC referendum as a platform for gauging student opinion, the low turnouts in UC elections offers a contradictory picture. While presidential elections normally receive more attention and higher voter turnouts than midterm elections, in which “literally no one voted in the Quincy midterm elections” one year, the recent elections have not seen high turnouts that provide a convincing mandate: Last year, only 2,792 students voted, itself a significant increase from the year prior in which only 2,074 students voted.
To be sure, previous referenda have admittedly been a microphone, if a perhaps somewhat redundant one, for student causes — as in a 2007 referendum that jumped on the bandwagon calling for fall final exams to be held before winter break. The UC, albeit one of more than a decade ago, deserves credit for that. But the fact remains that UC referenda should inspire little confidence. If we were Divest Harvard, we’d steer clear. But, sure, referendize, if you really want to.

Hundreds of Harvard affiliates walked out of class and gathered in Tercentenary Theater Monday to demonstrate support for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and Temporary Protected Status ahead of a Tuesday Supreme Court hearing on DACA.
Act on a Dream — a student-led immigration advocacy group at the College — organized the walkout along with 21 co-sponsoring campus organizations, including Divest Harvard and the Palestine Solidarity Committee.
The walk-out fell one day before the Supreme Court hears a case on DACA, an Obama-era program that allowed children brought to the United States by their parents to live and work in the country. The case will determine the fate of the program, which has been challenged by the Trump administration.
The more than 200 walk-out participants congregated in front of Memorial Church for a series of chants and speeches Monday afternoon.
Education School Professor Roberto G. Gonzales said that upcoming hearings are a source of unrest for those who fall under DACA and TPS protections.
“The stress, anxiety of tomorrow on many members of our community is palpable, and the weight cannot be more excruciating,” he said.
Doris Reina-Landaverde, a custodian at Harvard who received TPS in 2001, told the crowd that TPS recipients live in fear because of the hearings.
“We are under attack. We are thinking every day — what will the court decision say?” she said.
A court case about TPS — a program that grants temporary refuge in the United States to residents of countries afflicted by conflict and natural disasters, among other dangerous conditions — has already commenced, and a decision from the appeals courts is projected to come out soon. The DACA and TPS court cases will determine the futures of one million undocumented immigrants, 700,000 DACA recipients, and 300,000 TPS holders.
Act on a Dream Co-Director Diego Navarrete ’21 spoke about the benefits of DACA, but also its limitations. He pointed to pathways to citizenship for all undocumented immigrants as the end goal.
“DACA is literally breadcrumbs,” Navarrete said. “We need it to exist, but it’s the bare minimum.”
During the walk-out, speakers and organizers condemned The Crimson’s decision to request comment from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson in their coverage of Act on a Dream’s “Abolish ICE” protest in September. After the protest had concluded, Crimson reporters emailed ICE’s press office for comment. More than 900 people and several student groups have since signed an Act on a Dream petition criticizing The Crimson’s decision to reach out for comment.
In her remarks, Act on a Dream Co-Director Emily A. Romero ’21 called on all walk-out participants to decline any interview requests from the Crimson.
Crimson President Kristine E. Guillaume ’20 wrote in an emailed statement that the publication seeks to hold itself to the “highest standards” of journalistic practice with its policies for reaching out for comment.
“Fundamental journalistic values obligate The Crimson to allow all subjects of a story a chance to comment,” Guillaume wrote. “This policy demonstrates a commitment to ensuring that the individuals and institutions we write about have an opportunity to respond to criticisms in order to ensure a fair and unbiased story.”
“We welcome feedback from our readers and from those we cover. In this case, we met with representatives of Act on a Dream to hear their concerns and explain our approach,” she added.
Romero, a Crimson editorial editor, also urged walk-out participants to consider the 2020 Democratic Presidential candidates’ immigration platforms when they vote.
“We who do not have the power to vote are relying on everyone extending a hand to support us,” she said.
Act on a Dream organizers said they would soon be circulating a petition calling on the University to extend support to undocumented students in the form of legal resources and additional “administrative staff.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After months of lobbying lawmakers, University administrators are “pleased” with the changes in a new bill proposed by House Democrats to reauthorize the Higher Education Act of 1965.
The United States House of Representatives Committee on Education and Labor introduced the Democrat’s version of the reauthorization — dubbed the College Affordability Act — last month.
The Higher Education Act authorizes the federal student financial aid program and includes provisions for funding sources like Pell Grants; the Federal Work-Study Program; and loan repayment plans for undergraduate, graduate, and professional students.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newtown wrote in an emailed statement that administrators are satisfied with proposed changes to higher education accessibility contained in the bill.
“We are pleased to see the College Affordability Act is taking steps to create greater access to a college degree for students from any economic background, including long-overdue increases to the Pell grant program and improvements to student loan programs,” he wrote.
The new bill includes provisions to increase the value of Pell Grants, ease the burden of student loans, and block United States Secretary of Education Betsy D. DeVos’s proposed Title IX rule that would redefine sexual harassment, require live cross-examinations in investigatory proceedings, and allow proceedings to be discussed with outside parties.
Title IX is a federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex for educational institutions that receive federal funding.
Harvard and a coalition of universities across the country condemned the new Title IX proposal at the end of the public comment period in January, writing that the proposed change to the cross-examination policy is “restrictive” and “inappropriate.”
Newton also wrote that Bacow has focused on financial accessibility in conversations with lawmakers.
“In his discussion with Members of Congress, President Bacow has emphasized the importance of these programs in ensuring equitable opportunity to higher education,” Newton wrote.
Bacow has met with lawmakers throughout his tenure about the Higher Education Act — a bill that Congress has attempted to permanently reauthorize. Bacow has met with U.S. Representative Robert “Bobby” C. Scott (D-Va.) and Senator Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) — who chairs the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions — about the bill’s reauthorization.
Despite support from Harvard administrators, experts have raised concerns about the long-term consequences of the bill, citing possible increases that colleges and universities may make to its tuition costs.
Neal McCluskey, director of the Cato Institute’s Center for Educational Freedom, said that institutions of higher education often raise their own prices to “capture” the increase in federal aid or reduce their own aid packages for students.
McCluskey said, however, that Harvard is a special case. Holding the largest university endowment in the world at $40.9 billion, the University may have the resources to maintain their costs despite any changes to Pell Grants or other student aid programs.
“Harvard works very hard to make itself affordable for people who would have difficulty paying the sticker price,” McCluskey said. “Many other colleges do not have the resources to do that.”
During the 2017-2018 school year, Harvard had 1,254 Pell Grant recipients who received awards totaling $5,601,702 and 1,120 students on Federal Work Study, collectively receiving $2,397,897.
Sixteen percent of the roughly 6,600 current undergraduate students receive Pell Grants, according to the Harvard College admissions website
A provision that could imperil Harvard’s social group sanctions is also on the table as the legislation moves through Congress. The College’s sanctions bar members of single-gender Greek groups and final clubs from leading extracurricular organizations, becoming athletic captains, and earning College endorsements for prestigious academic fellowships.
In a committee hearing about the College Affordability Act, U.S. Representative Elise M. Stefanik ’06 (R-N.Y.) introduced an amendment to the College Affordability Act denouncing the sanctions and seeking to guarantee “non-retaliation against students of single-sex social organizations.”
Newton wrote that the University was not in favor of that provision’s inclusion in the bill.
“We continue to be deeply concerned about efforts by Congress that would legislate student life and override Harvard’s policy on unrecognized single-gender social organizations which appropriately aligns institutional support and recognition with institutional values and our policies on non-discrimination,” Newton wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A woman accusing former Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez of sexual misconduct said she and three other women are “concerned” with the progress of Harvard’s external review into the circumstances that allowed Dominguez to perpetrate misconduct over four decades at the University.
Eileen Finan — a lawyer for the Office of the General Counsel — reached out in September to former Government Ph.D. candidate Suzanna E. Challen, former Government assistant professor Terry L. Karl, and former Government concentrators Nienke C. Grossman ’99 and Charna E. Sherman ’80. They, along with 14 other women, first publicly levied accusations against Dominguez in spring 2018, prompting a Title IX investigation into Dominguez and then the ongoing external review.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow commissioned the external review in May after the Title IX investigation found Dominguez engaged in unwelcome sexual conduct toward several people multiple times over a decades-long period. Bacow said the external review would not focus on the allegations against Dominguez but rather the “organization or culture” that might have prevented victims and bystanders from coming forward.
In September, Finan contacted a lawyer who represents the four women to arrange a meeting between them and the three academics conducting the external review, according to Challen.
The four women offered to fly to New York to meet with the committee in October, but Finan declined, according to Challen. As of last week, Challen said, Finan and Deputy Provost Margaret E. Newell have offered the women two additional dates to meet — one during the committee members’ internal planning time and another on the day they will visit Harvard’s campus.
Challen said she and the other women are concerned that the lack of available meeting time suggests that the committee will not adequately prioritize the review.
“I expect that the committee will meet with us, but my concern is just in the lack of time being allocated to this,” Challen said. “I really would like to see the investigators prioritize this in their schedule and make a commitment to conduct as many campus visits as necessary to meet with interested participants in this process.”
The reviewers will only visit campus once this semester, according to Challen. She said she and the other three women are “especially concerned” about accepting a meeting during the campus visit, which will take place Dec. 11.
“That's the day they're going to be meeting with graduate students, people in the Gov department, people in the Weatherhead Center, other students who are concerned about sexual harassment,” Challen said. “There's an opportunity for them to hear from a lot of people when they visit campus, so we certainly don't want to crowd out their time that day.”
“It sends a message of disinterest to have only one campus visit in the remainder of this calendar year and only to offer a 4:30 in the afternoon slot or for us to come to that one campus visit,” she added.
Karl and Grossman did not respond to a request for comment, and Sherman declined to comment, deferring to Challen.
Harvard spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that the review is ongoing and “remains a priority” for the University.
“The committee continues to work to engage members of the Harvard community through in-person meetings, as well as collecting information and perspectives through phone conversations and in writing,” he wrote. “The committee and the University are committed to ensuring this review is a robust examination of factors detailed in the committee's charge that may undermine the ability to prevent or address incidents of sexual harassment.”
Challen and the other three women have previously raised concerns about Harvard’s handling of its investigation into Dominguez.
In May — after Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay announced she would bar Dominguez from campus and strip him of his emeritus status — the same four women and their lawyers said Harvard “stonewalled” them out of the investigation, declining to accept information on their terms about their allegations.
Sophie Hill, a graduate student who serves on an informal committee within the Government department called the “External Review Working Group,” said the women’s frustrations with the external review reflect what she believes to be the University's lack of transparency in its review.
“There's just a lot of unanswered questions,” she said. “When trust is this low, that's just not the right thing to do.”
Hill said that some graduate students would like the opportunity to submit input to the external review committee, rather than speak in person, but she has not received word about whether she will be able to do so.

The renovated Smith Playground in Allston — boasting the City of Boston’s first pumptrack, a new multipurpose sports field, a street hockey rink, and an amphitheater — officially reopened to the public earlier this month.
The total budget for the $6.4 million redesign project, which underwent a public master planning process in 2015, included a $1.9 million contribution from the Harvard Allston Public Realm Flexible Fund — a local grant program for projects that enhance public spaces. The new renovations mark the end of phase one of the project.
University Executive Vice President Katie Lapp joined Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh and Boston Recreation Commissioner Ryan Woods at the playground’s reopening ceremony Nov. 2. She called the redesign an important step in promoting the “shared future” between Harvard and Allston.
“The Smith Field project has been one of the most exciting and rewarding of Harvard’s commitment to the community, and this incredible space will continue to strengthen ties between our campus and our community,” Lapp wrote in an emailed statement.
The park’s renovations grew out of public input from several open meetings. The project falls within the City’s Open Space and Recreation Plan, a six-year program aimed at promoting and protecting open space in Boston.
The central goals of the project are to increase the park’s green space, improve its accessibility and visibility, and serve residents of all ages, according to its master plan.
Harvard-Allston Task Force Chair John A. Bruno said the park will improve the livability and sustainability of the neighborhood, especially given its central location. He added that he is glad that Harvard had acknowledged its responsibility to give back to the city.
“I think for Harvard to understand and cooperate with the City of Boston and the neighborhood, in the quality of life issues — that they're an important component, you know, to create a useful community, a stable community, and a resourceful community,” Bruno said.
Planning for the second phase – which will include the construction of baseball and softball fields — kicked off Nov. 6 with a planning meeting open to Allston residents.
Brighton resident Jane McHale noted that the vast variety of amenities that the park offers — ranging from picnic spaces to outdoor exercise equipment — will ensure it is a space for everyone who needs it.
“It will be really a big gathering place for the neighborhood. And it’s far more beautiful than it ever was,” McHale said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria prepares to step down at the end of the academic year, Business School faculty have praised his innovative leadership in prioritizing diversity at the school and fostering closer relationships between affiliates.
Nohria announced that he would step down on June 30, 2020 in an email to Business School affiliates Wednesday. He spent 22 years as a Business School professor before becoming dean in July 2010. During his tenure, the Business School launched Harvard Business School Online, offering online business school courses for students and professionals. Nohria also oversaw a record-breaking capital campaign that raised nearly $1.4 billion as part of a University-wide fundraising effort.
Nohria was widely considered a potential candidate to succeed former University President Drew G. Faust. The position ultimately went to University President Lawrence S. Bacow.
Bacow wrote in an email Wednesday that he and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 will soon start a search for Nohria’s successor.
Under Nohria’s leadership, the Business School has focused on its “five I” priorities: innovation, intellectual ambition, internationalization, inclusion, and integration. Nohria wrote in the email announcing his departure that the school had made “good progress” on the five priorities during his 10-year tenure.
Multiple faculty said Nohria’s tenure reflected his dedication to the Business School and his commitment to listening to the concerns of its affiliates. From the start, Nohria articulated his priorities for the school to make his tenure more effective, according to Jan W. Rivkin, the senior associate dean and chair of the school’s MBA program.
“Nitin declared his strategic priorities on the day he was named the dean-to-be, and he has stuck with those five priorities through his entire tenure,” Rivkin said.
“[The “five I” priorities plan] has been extraordinarily helpful for the school. I think we all have known what he prioritized and so we could go out and do the things that he thought we should do,” Rivkin added.
During his tenure, Nohria also worked to promote gender equality and increase the number of female administrators and faculty at the school, according to Senior Associate Dean for Culture and Community Janice H. Hammond.
Hammond noted that five of the 13 senior administrative deans are women.
“There's never been demographics like that in the dean's management group at HBS. And it makes a difference,” said Hammond.
Nohria oversaw a 2015 push for greater gender equality in the classroom at the Business School. Under his leadership, the Business School undertook an initiative to double the number of female protagonists — central characters in the case studies dissected by Business School students — by 2019.
The class of 2021 at Harvard Business School is composed of 43 percent women, according to the Business School’s website.
Senior Associate Dean for Executive Education Luis M. Viceira praised Nohria for his “inclusive leadership style.”
“He's not someone who is going to be putting off people but quite the contrary, he's very good to involve everyone in the conversation to have every voice listened to, and to try to learn from, you know, the collective wisdom of a group,” said Viceira.
Several faculty said they will miss Nohria’s leadership and devotion to the school.
Gary W. Loveman, a senior lecturer at the Business School, met Nohria when both were Ph.D. students at MIT. Loveman said that the two young academics, despite being a year apart in school, bonded over their shared thesis advisor and a mutual love of the Celtics basketball team, of which Loveman now owns a small stake.
“He is deeply devoted to the school, and its mission — the education of leaders is something that he believes in very deeply,” Loveman said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first weekend of back-to-back road games, Harvard stole the home-ice advantage from its opponents, cruising to a 6-2 win over No. 7/7 Princeton and outlasting Quinnipiac in a 3-2 overtime thriller.
The Crimson’s spotless 5-0-0 start to the season is its best since the 2007-08 season, when the eventual national finalists rattled off 11 consecutive wins to open play; the 2012-13 NCAA quarterfinalist squad also won five to start.
HARVARD 3, QUINNIPIAC 2 (OT)
A flurry of action in the final minutes of play — minutes that bridged the gap from regulation to overtime — briefly threatened to halt the Crimson’s season-opening win streak on Saturday, before a quick start to sudden death dashed the Bobcats’ hopes of a comeback at home.
The match had held at 2-1 since a score by Harvard (5-0-0, 5-0-0 ECAC) from captain Kat Hughes in the third minute of the second period, a single shift after Quinnipiac (4-5-2, 0-4-1 ECAC) netted a game-tying goal in the opening plays back from intermission.
“We have that mentality of, ‘OK, they scored, now we’re gonna score,’” Hughes said. “Everyone’s attitudes are so positive and encouraging and confident in each other. I think that played a huge role in responding to goals against.”
Then, with exactly one minute remaining, the Bobcats earned a power play. Quinnipiac pulled its goalie, bumping the standard 5-4 advantage to a 6-4 tilt. The Crimson crushed a number of efforts, but the Bobcats collected a rebound with under 25 seconds to play. After a series of passes, co-captain Kati Tabin tapped the puck in to force extra time.
Harvard recovered quickly. Sophomore goalie Lindsay Reed and the defense fended off several attempts from Quinnipiac, and the puck found its way to Crimson sticks. Hughes flicked the puck toward the net, and sophomore forward Anne Bloomer was there for the follow-through. For the sixth time this season, her shot converted.
“It was really a great team effort,” Bloomer said. “It started with the shift before, getting it into the opponent’s zone, and us just working it and finding pucks on net.”
Back-and-forth play defined the entire match in a way that Harvard had yet to see this season. The Crimson never trailed — the 2019-20 vintage of Harvard hockey, in fact, has yet to trail in any game — but the Bobcats never fell more than one goal back.
The Crimson first struck seven minutes into the game on a shot from junior forward Keely Moy. Quinnipiac evened the score in minute two of the second, but Harvard responded moments later when Hughes cashed in on a rebound from junior forward Becca Gilmore.
The remaining time was all defense — that is, until the final minutes, when the Bobcats found twine to force overtime, and the Crimson scored to win its opening quintet.
“The Quinnipiac game was a huge moment for our program, because, as a senior, that was my first overtime win at Harvard,” Hughes said. “Getting scored on with 18 seconds left, and not getting down … speaks a lot to our team’s resilience, so that was an awesome feeling.”
HARVARD 6, PRINCETON 2
The Crimson struck early and often on the offensive, netting three goals by the end of the first period of Friday’s contest. The Tigers (5-2-0, 3-2-0 ECAC) cut the lead to 3-1 halfway through the second period, but Harvard’s fourth goal soon after stretched the lead to 4-1 and put the Crimson in control for the 6-2 final.
“Against a great like that with a strong defense, you’ve really got to take your chances when they give them to you,” Hughes said. “So, we really did take the puck to the net as much as we could, and we were able to capitalize a lot.”
A key feature of the Crimson attack was its balance. While Bloomer did contribute a multi-goal game, she was far from the only player to make a dent on the scoresheet — five Harvard skaters added goals, and four others added at least an assist.
“I think it [the scoring balance] just shows that we have a lot of depth,” Bloomer said. “Something that I think we struggled with last year is getting goals on the board, so having the ability and the skill and the work to put a lot of goals up means that we’re more likely to win games.”
In addition to balance, timely scoring played a major role in Harvard's fast start. A 2-0 lead going into the first intermission still would have buoyed the Crimson, but a three-goal lead could prove insurmountable for the Tigers. With just 25 seconds and change left in the first, junior defender Emma Buckles managed to collect a loose puck in front and stash it in the back of the net, taking the air out of the Princeton defense that had hoped to escape the period on a high note.
The scoring settled down for the first half of the second period until, at the 9:16 mark, Princeton broke the ice with its first response of the game. Winning the draw back to the point, the Tigers senior forward Carly Bullock fired a wrister on the ice through traffic before junior forward Sharon Frankel slid home the rebound to take the score to 3-1. Nonetheless, the two-goal deficit only lasted for 1:52, as Bloomer netted her second of the game. Tipping a centering pass from junior forward Becca Gilmore into the top shelf, Bloomer re-established momentum for Harvard.
“One thing that I think our team did really well this weekend was to respond immediately to our opponents’ scoring — which is huge, stealing the momentum right back,” Bloomer said. “A game has its ebbs and flows, and we just try to move on right after they score and take the game back into our hands.”
After taking the 4-1 lead into the locker room for the second intermission, the Crimson would score its fifth goal on a powerplay strike from sophomore forward Dominique Petrie before the Tigers responded with a powerplay score of their own to get game back to a three-goal deficit.
Harvard would have the last laugh, however, capping the scoring with 5:11 left in the contest on a breakaway deke from sophomore forward Kristin Della Rovere. In the cage, Reed contributed a stellar performance for the Crimson, turning away 40 of 42 shots faced. In particular, Reed set the tone for the Harvard scoring outbreak in the first by holding the Tigers scoreless on 16 shots. Princeton outshot Harvard in the opening act, 16-11, but Reed ensured that the shot advantage did not translate to a goal advantage.
After a 10-day layoff, Harvard will lace up for its first non-conference game of the year on Nov. 19 at 7 p.m. away at Boston University. The teams last went head-to-head in the 2019 Beanpot Championship, a heartbreaking overtime loss for Harvard that brought the Terriers their first Beanpot title. With time off, Harvard's biggest challenge will be to maintain the momentum of the fast start and push its win streak to six.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Parity is a classic buzzword when describing Ivy League football. Whether you have been a head coach in the league for 26 seasons or an Ancient Eight sports reporter for three years, you have heard the word parity used to describe the conference. “Anyone can beat anybody,” we constantly claim. Do I continue to say this so that I can justify any missed picks in my Around the Ivies columns? Perhaps. Am I writing this column so that I can further justify any missed picks from my co-writers and myself in the future? Also possible. Maybe we are scared that we are going to lose our touch.
Recently, this parity talk has been mostly lip service. Princeton rattled off an impressive 17 straight wins. Dartmouth had only lost one game in nearly two years, and its loss came at the hands of Princeton. The middle teams were extremely middling, and a loss meant you were well out of the running for teams hoping to lose less than four games. And Brown was, well, Brown.
But as Bob Dylan once mumbled through a song, “the times they are a-changin.’” While Brown continues to do much of the same, many teams are feeling the switching tide. The mighty mighty Tigers have finally fallen, and we will likely have a new champion once again. The Big Green has seemingly taken the throne as the new leaders. Middling teams are battling it out. As recent results have shown, Ivy League parity is back.
Anyone who has been paying attention to recent conference play can see that the parity is back in the Ancient Eight. We are seeing crazy blowouts followed by nail-biting classics. Princeton had not previously lost since 2017, and this past week they lost by three possessions. Games between Penn, Brown, and Cornell have been barn-burning matchups coming down to the wire each week. In the three games between these teams, the victorious squad has won by only two or less points.
For Harvard, a close loss on the road at the Tigers left hope for the future. A defensive battle against Dartmouth gave the Crimson an opening for a share at the Ivy League title. This is where Ivy League parity struck in classic chaotic fashion. Harvard was a mere six seconds away from an improbable victory and a great chance at a shared Ivy League title, assuming Dartmouth could defeat Princeton and the Crimson could win out against lesser teams than the Big Green. One Hail Mary later, Harvard found itself fighting for a hopeful two-loss conference season to stay near the top of an Ivy League race that was likely lost. One week later, the worst offense in the Ancient Eight topped the Crimson in overtime and Harvard will now need to win out in order to finish in the top half of the league.
As a History concentrator, I have little time for numbers. But as a sports fan, I love statistics. Taking a look at the recent box scores of the Ivy League and completely throwing out actual reliable statistical analysis, we can arbitrarily prove the return of parity to the Ancient Eight without actual mathematical principles. This season, Yale was pummeled 42-10 by Dartmouth. The Bulldogs were picked as the preseason favorite to take home the crown, yet seemed to be underperforming by sneaking by in tight victories and showing they do not belong with a big dog such as the Big Green Defensive MachineTM. Yale barely topped a struggling Penn, winning 46-41 thanks to its offense. This Penn team was crushed by a struggling Columbia, 44-6, yet the Bulldogs wailed on the Lions in an easy 45-10 victory. For a Harvard team that played Dartmouth to the final whistle, Columbia was seen by many as a speed bump on the Crimson schedule. An overtime loss later, Harvard was left scratching its head.
What does all this mean? Technically speaking, the transitive property is not a scientific way to look at the performance of sports teams. But I can tell you won thing: In any given week, do not count a single team out. This is the league of parity, and as long as you are not named Brown, you should never feel like you are out of a game. This league is all about chaos, and after a few years of dominating superpowers and underforming bottom-feeders, the Ancient Eight is chaotic once again. Ivy League parity is back and better than ever.

Concentration declaration is a rite of passage at Harvard. Some students know what they want to concentrate in from the moment they step foot on campus, and others are still wavering at 11:59 p.m. on declaration day. To get some perspective on concentration declaration, we asked Flyby sophomores studying the social sciences why they declared.
Economics: Ariana Chiu ’22
I’d be lying if I said I came out of the womb with a passion for drawing demand curves and maximizing utility. I knew coming into college, however, that I wanted to combine my interests in mathematics and the humanities, and I soon realized that economics was the sweet spot I was searching for. The courses I have taken over the past three semesters have revealed how omnipresent the principles of economics are, and I’m excited to explore more niche applications of economics in the coming years.
Economics is truly everywhere, and though I may not know exactly what career(s) I want to pursue in the future, the concentration provides me with a great degree of flexibility and freedom to discover just that. Courses in economics will enable me to develop invaluable skills, ranging from critical thinking to data analysis, and equip me with the tools to better engage with and propose solutions to global social, political, and economic issues.
I am also interested in human decision-making and the ways in which our decisions interact on a broader scale. So sure, concentrating in Ec is basically asking to be labelled either a snake or a sellout, but if you ask me, the benefits undoubtedly outweigh the costs in the end.
Social Studies: Rachel L. Reynolds ’22
First, a disclaimer: Concentration Declaration Day is coming up, and I’m still not entirely sure what I’ll be concentrating in. I’ve known since the beginning that I’ve wanted to concentrate in a social sciences field, but so far I’ve considered nearly everything: Government, History, Sociology, Anthropology, Psychology, and (of course) Social Studies. This indecision is one reason that I’m leaning heavily towards Social Studies with a secondary in Psychology, since it involves nearly all of these fields I’ve considered.
However, this indecision isn’t my only reasoning. While Social Studies is a good possibility for anyone wanting to get a little sample of everything, it has many of its own merits that I appreciate so much. One of the best descriptions I’ve heard of this concentration is that you can study a little bit about everything, versus a lot about one thing in other concentrations. While this has its pros and cons, I really like the idea of being able to pick a topic that I’m passionate about and explore it using a bunch of different disciplines. And while writing a thesis seems daunting, I am comforted by how the department encourages concentrators to start thinking of their focus fields from the very beginning (though there’s no pressure to stick with these original plans).
While a lot of my plans are still up in the air, I’m so excited to be taking this next step and actually declaring a concentration in Social Studies!
Psychology: Allison S. Barker '22
In high school, I found myself immersed in both the scientific and artistic communities, although I rarely felt as though either were completely right fits for me. For this reason, I suspected that I might find myself studying the social sciences when I came to college. Much to the chagrin of my mother and various Uber drivers who have helpfully warned me that I could be studying things that would make me employable, I have found myself drawn toward Psychology. The concentration is far from an unusual choice for the undergraduate body, and the sheer size of the department initially discouraged me from wanting to join the ranks of its loyal student body.
My attitude shifted solidly, however, over the course of my first semester at Harvard, when I took SLS20: “Psychological Science” (now PSY1: “Introduction to Psychological Science”) and ended up in a Psychology of Religion seminar. Both were highlights of my semester. Throughout my (almost) three semesters at Harvard, Psychology has been the only field of classes that I have consistently enjoyed taking. I always looked forward to finishing readings in my SLS20 textbook and am always intrigued by the papers that I have to pour through for my Psychology tutorial.
I joined Professor Daniel Gilbert’s social psychology lab during my second semester of freshman year, and that experience has been similarly positive. The staff members and graduate students of the Harvard Psychology department are some of the most welcoming and helpful humans that I have encountered at this school, and I have never felt anything short of fully supported and cared for as part of the community. I cannot wait to continue deepening my connection to the Psychology department (and the College at large) as I progress through college. Here’s to hoping I’ll still be able to get a job post-graduation!
