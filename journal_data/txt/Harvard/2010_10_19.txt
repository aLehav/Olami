New College Theatre
Directed by Meryl H. Federman ’11
Produced by Diana Michta ’11 and Annie E.M. McGrath ’13
“Think ‘Hamlet’—with more blood and death!” says director Meryl H. Federman ’11 about the Hyperion Shakespeare Company (HSC) production of “The Spanish Tragedy.”
Thomas Kyd’s play was exceptionally influential in its time and inspired more than a few elements in his contemporary William Shakespeare’s now more famous tragedy. Like “Hamlet,” it features a play-within-a-play and a vengeful ghost.
Thus it seems appropriate that the HSC has chosen “The Spanish Tragedy” as its first production where the Company’s namesake is nowhere to be found in the credits. “It is really the first modern revenge play,” says Federman, who is also president of the Company.
Set in the Spanish court, the play centers on the knight marshal of Spain, Hieronimo, who struggles with avenging the murder of his son Horatio. Also entangled in this tragic tale are Bel-Imperia, Horatio’s grieving lover, and Lorenzo, Bel-Imperia’s brother and one of Horatio’s murderers. As promised, violence ensues. The Spanish royalty set about stabbing and backstabbing each other as the plot unfolds.
“There’s lots of fake blood, and pretty much any type of physical violence you can think of,” says Harleen K. Gambhir ’14, who plays Bel-Imperia. “We even have a functioning gallows,” adds producer Diana Michta ’11, referring to a key scene where a character is hanged. A professional choreographer has been enlisted to hone the play’s many fight sequences.
After all that fake blood has been spilled, however, “The Spanish Tragedy” aims higher than the primitive impulse. The play is an exploration of how revenge and violence can tear apart a political body.
“The theme of revenge has resonance in a time where politics has become so personal,” Joshua O. Wilson ’13, who plays Hieronimo, notes.
“The Spanish Tragedy” is over 400 years old, but Federman promises that its action-driven plot and straightforward language make the play more accessible than Shakespeare’s.
“It didn’t need much updating,” she says—after all, “Revenge is a theme we find in movies all the time today.”

Loeb Mainstage
Directed by Scott Zigler
Produced by Danielle N. Drees ’12
Relationship complications, sex, and a love hexagon take the stage in “Trust,” the first Mainstage production of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club (HRDC) season, which premieres on Friday, October 22.
Composed of only six characters, Stephen Dietz’s play is this year’s visiting director’s project, which brings in a professional director for undergraduates to work with.
Scott Zigler has taken the reins as director of the show, marking his second time working on a visiting director’s project. Zigler has worked at Harvard for 14 years, as the director of the A.R.T. Institute and a Dramatic Arts professor.
He worked with the HRDC to produce a show that was both appealing to audiences and different from the rest of the productions coming out this time of year.
That happy balance was discovered in “Trust.”
“The play really shows what it’s like when you fall in love, [when] you’ve been betrayed or lied to [by] someone, or when you see someone you haven’t seen in a while,” Zigler says. “It captures the snapshots of different moments that occur to everyone sooner or later.”
Producer Danielle N. Drees ’12 agrees that the issues and experiences that arise in “Trust” are relatable to the vast majority of Harvard students. The array of new faces that worked on the production help to diversify and bring new perspectives to Harvard theater. “It’s sort of a turnover year, so we have a lot of new designers for elements such as set, lighting, and costumes. They’re already showing a great commitment to detail,” Drees says.
A minimalist set and basic costume design will accent the production, as the main focus will be on the characters’ relationships and conversations with one another. In fact, essentially the only piece of set design will be a bridge highlighted by an eastern city skyline.
This simplicity creates a sense of realism. Rheeqrheeq A. Chainey ’11, who plays Gretchen, adds, “The show is just normal people trying to push through and the hope in their lives, while still trying to get laid.”

Loeb Experimental Theater
Directed by Jesse T. Nee-Vogelman ’13
Produced by Kelly M. Conley ’11
In an environment that specializes in more experimental theater, Harvard undergraduates are blurring the lines between rehearsal and performance. Luigi Pirandello’s “Six Characters in Search of an Author” is already famous for experimenting with metatheater, but the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production will put this classic play in a new context: Harvard.
“Six Characters” takes place at a rehearsal for another play, when suddenly the stage is invaded by unfinished characters who demand an author to complete their story. The Director agrees, leading to an exploration of both the characters’ stories and the nature of art.
“The play is about figuring out where our reality ends and the reality of the show begins,” says director Jesse T. Nee-Vogelman ’13. For an audience of mainly Harvard undergraduates, “our reality” is literal. “It’s set as a group of actors for a Harvard production. There are references to a few groups on the Harvard campus,” says Daniel W. Erickson ’14, who is playing the Father.
These references are in part due to the new translation from the Italian by Brandon J. Ortiz ’12. The language is much more modern, and shies away from the more stylistic literary language used in previous translations.
This production has also taken the work’s play-within-a-play to a whole new level. “Usually when people do this play there is an actor to play the Director and actors to play the Tech Director and Lighting Designer. In this production the actors are actors and the characters are actors, but the Director is also the real director,” says Renée R. Donlon, who plays the Stepdaughter. This device plays with the division between art and reality in a way seldom seen in other productions both of this work and in the general realm of theater.
The Loeb Experimental Theater was created to showcase performances that push conventional boundaries, and this production is in keeping with this philosophy—both of the theater and the man who wrote the play.

Alfred Brendel reads his poem with a nonchalant, playful solemnity. It’s a whimsical, unobtrusive parody of a public service announcement, describing with the utmost sincerity how pianos should be “smoked” in chimneys rather than “cooked.” His audience roars with laughter.
Alfred Brendel is not a comedian, nor is he solely a poet. As those well-versed in classical music would attest, he’s best known as one of the world’s most accomplished and knowledgeable classical pianists.
But when Brendel appeared October 13 as part of the Conversations with Kirkland series and the Office for the Arts’ Learning from Performers program, two sides of him were present: the prolific, perceptive musician and the charming, creative man.
“He is such a titan of the music world. His performing and his knowledge of repertory is just incredible,” says Thomas S. Lee, the Learning from Performers program manager. “But I was also really struck by the other side of him, the more playful side.”
In the middle of the conversation, music professor Anne C. Shreffler, who moderated the event, played Brendel’s recording of Variation 20 from Beethoven’s “Diabelli Variations.” This piece, she said, had earned a particular nickname from German conductor Hans von Bülow—“the Oracle.”
As a musician, Brendel is himself somewhat of an oracle. As he discussed during the event, he is part of a school of performers who focus not on reinventing or embellishing the pieces they play, but on trying to understand and channel the feelings the composer meant to convey. “The main style is that you respect what the composer wrote down, respect that he took the time to write down all those markings,” Brendel said during the conversation.
Brendel and Shreffler discussed particularly the great European composers (whose pieces comprise much of Brendel’s famed repertoire) and the influences behind their style and works, topics ranging from the unique sensibilities of Chopin as a composer for the piano rather than for the ensemble, the inspiration from other genres in the works of Bach and Haydn, and the unexpected humor behind Beethoven’s “Diabelli Variations.”
“[Brendel’s] reading of the score is very, very precise. He’ll say, ‘this is a Beethoven kind of pianissimo,’ or ,‘This is a Schubert kind of pianissimo,’ and I think that is unusual. He has studied the complete works of these composers, so he knows that when [Beethoven] writes pianissimo he means a certain thing,” Shreffler says. “He’s not saying ‘I can read the composer’s mind,’ but he’s coming at it by studying and becoming familiar with the score and taking every notation seriously.”
Interspersed throughout the discussion were recordings by Brendel, such as several of the “Diabelli Variations” and a Schubert minuet, and the discussion concluded with a question-and-answer session.
When asked for advice, Brendel returned to the importance of understanding the composer’s intentions. “The most important advice I have to give is: study composition. Try to compose. It can help to see what it means to write these things down,” Brendel said. “When I studied composition, I was always interested in how one [composes], how the mind of the composer works and, more importantly, how the mind of this particular composer works.”
But Brendel is not all notation and interpretation. He also exhibited a more playful attitude, encouraging the audience not to always take art so seriously. In the discussion, he commented on the humor that can be found in musical interplay, but he was also prompted to read some of his own bizarrely funny, Dada-esque poetry.
“I was very glad that Anne Shreffler asked him to read, because I think that’s a side of Brendel that people don’t really see much of. I think seeing that side of him was interesting and eye-opening,” Lee says.
Those attending the conversation say they appreciated the small-scale setting of the event and the human connection to the artist it offered.
“It allowed him as well as the audience to really open up. When you’re a performer and you’re on a stage, you can’t pull out someone’s personality. Even if you’re in a lecture hall and you’re listening to someone discuss whatever it is, they don’t have that relaxed way of presenting material,” Danielle G. Rabinowitz ’14 says.
The day after the Conversations with Kirkland event, Brendel gave the Louis C. Elson lecture entitled, “Musical Character in Beethoven’s Sonatas,” in Paine Hall. Interspersing commentary with performance, he presented how each sonata was carefully structured to reflect its inspiration, which could be anything from a galloping horse to a divine messenger.
“To have the experience of an extraordinary intellectual point of view in lecture, which is underpinned by a series of sound worlds of that kind, is not something that anybody who attended that lecture can hope to experience often,” music professor Robert D. Levin ’68 says. “The apollonian view that Maestro Brendel has represented for his entire performance lifespan is the stance of truly lasting values that, to my mind, present the absolute ideal approach to artistry.”

Rebecca D. Costa is a sociobiologist whose first book, “The Watchman’s Rattle: Thinking Our Way Out of Extinction,” explores current problems plaguing society—from economic recession to global warming—and why we seem unable to resolve them. Costa argues that the accelerating complexity of world problems has outpaced the human brain’s ability to develop new skills to manage them. The book utilizes a new form of publishing technology, featuring not only a print foreword by E. O. Wilson, a research professor in the department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, but also multiple e-forewords authored by individuals including Tina Brown, Richard Branson, and Donald Trump. On October 19, at the Harvard Coop, Costa will participate in a dialogue with Wilson about the increasing complexity of the world.
The Harvard Crimson: Give us an overview of “The Watchman’s Rattle” and the idea behind it.
Rebecca D. Costa: “The Watchman’s Rattle” is an exploration that began for me about seven years ago. I became curious about why we seem to struggle with the same problems generation after generation, and we don’t seem to be able to get our arms around it, particularly now when we have so much more research and information and technology and options available to us.
The first third of my book is looking back into past history to see what happened to the people before the cataclysmic events occurred that caused them to collapse. I go into the history of the Mayans, the Romans, the Egyptians and the Khmer, and it turns out that there are two signs that begin to occur very early on prior to the collapse, several generations beforehand. That is, that they become gridlocked, unable to solve their problems, as the problems are getting worse and worse, until eventually, one of them can’t be stopped. The second thing that happens is, when the facts become too complicated, when the problems exceed the cognitive capabilities that we as a biological organism have evolved to that point… We substitute beliefs for facts. There’s an abandonment of rational problem-solving that goes on…and that leads to collapse.
THC: If our problems exceed our cognitive abilities, how can we fix those problems?
RDC: We have two things, in my view, available that ancient civilizations did not have. One: we have models for high failure rates, for situations when no amount of due diligence will allow you to pick the solutions that will work from the solutions that won’t work. The easiest one to grasp is venture capitalism. Venture capitalists are experts at failure. They’re not really experts at success. For every 100 companies they invest in, 80 are going to be average or fail. 20 percent are going to be so spectacular that it diminishes the failure.
The second thing is brain fitness and neurological tools… We have discovered by looking at images of the brain that every now and again, a little portion of the brain called the ACC [anterior cingulate cortex] lights up like a Christmas tree, and we suddenly have what scientists are calling an “insight.” It turns out all human beings—this is not nurture, this is nature—have these spontaneous ‘a-ha!’ moments where they make connections of data in their head and they solve an elegant and really complicated problem. This seems to be a method of problem-solving that is suited to high levels of complexity that exceed left and right problem-solving abilities that we have evolved.
THC: How can we maximize our use of insight?
RDC: What we need to do is develop insight on demand… But because we can’t evolve on demand, that’s why mitigation is so important. When you know that you’re up against complexity that exceeds what the human brain has evolved to be able to handle, then you can mitigate, but you must also do everything possible to catch the brain up to complexity.
THC: Your book is a bit of a hybrid in the way that you combine traditional publishing with new technology through the use of e-forewords.
RDC: I was very privileged and very honored to have Dr. E. O. Wilson offer to write the foreword to my book. Simultaneously, I had offers from several other people whom I truly respect… It occurred to me that it might be interesting to have a hybrid book. The book was coming out in a physical package, but what would happen if we just published all these different e-forewords and said, self-select the person whose thoughts about the book you care about the most. What authors are really doing [when they select someone to write a foreword] is saying, “Well, this person is important to me, and you can see the book through their eyes and not through anyone else’s.” That seemed to not really take advantage of electronic publishing in the flexibility that it offers.

In the modern era of sports, being a college coach carries with it the burden of constant media attention. Facing dozens of reporters at press conferences, head coaches have gotten savvier—they say what they need to and leave the rest up for speculation. Here at The Back Page, we’re happy to decode some of these media sessions, showing the average fan what we think coaches’ answers “really” mean. 
Lehigh coach Andy Coen enjoyed a nice comeback win after his Mountain Hawk squad stormed back from 17 points down to topple Harvard football last Saturday. The coach was humble going into the press conference, citing how fortunate his team was to walk away with the win. But when it came time to give the players some love, Coen got a little bit stingier.
What Coen said: “[Ryan Spadola] works incredibly hard. Just looking at him you can tell he likes the weight room, but he’s still young, and he’s still learning. Our first ballgame at Drake, he had an outstanding game, but this was certainly a breakout day for him. And he’ll be the first to tell you he’s got to keep working.”
What Coen meant: This is certainly some tepid praise for a gamechanger whose 206 yards receiving and two touchdowns made Harvard’s secondary look about as formidable as the Slovakian women’s national hockey team. Basically, Coen is admitting that he had absolutely no idea that Spadola—one year removed from practice-squad duty—was capable of this type of performance. “Breakout day” is head coach lingo for, “I wouldn’t have bet on that in Vegas if you gave me 500:1 odds.” But after Saturday, neither Coen nor opponents will underestimate the sophomore playmaker again.
What Coen said: “We gave up some big plays in the run game largely due to missed tackles. And [senior running back] Gino Gordon I think is a fabulous back, I think he’s proved that here. But we didn’t tackle him as well as we could.”
What Coen meant: It’s so strange that every week opposing coaches seem to lament poor tackling on Gordon. It’s as if the senior standout has a magical influence that makes Patriot League defenders leave their fundamentals at home. Oh wait, that’s just called being a good running back. Gordon has been one of the Ancient Eight’s most elusive backs for the past couple of years, making defenders miss with a combination of sharp cuts and powerful running. His spin move to escape a Bulldog tackler on a fourth down during last year’s playing of The Game was a classic Gordon moment, and the senior has made a habit of similar moves this season. While Coen was certainly right in pointing out the Mountain Hawks’ sloppy tackling, Lehigh is not the first squad to come up empty against Gordon.

Jail time doesn’t always equate reform. When T.I. was released from jail, his first album was one of repentance, meant to teach his audience that breaking the law is not the way. But take Lil Wayne, who pleaded guilty in October 2009 to weapon posession and has been in prison for seven months—he just released an album from his cell on his birthday, heralding everything he does that normal society doesn’t consider acceptable. Weezy’s new album, “I Am Not a Human Being,” proclaims “You can try to lock me up / You can try to break me down / But I stay strong / It’s my time / Can’t stop now cause that ain’t me.” It’s hard, in the best sense of the word, and Weezy uses his ever clever and current lyrics to bring extremely explicit rap to the mainstream.
It’s evident from the very beginning of the album that this is the true Lil Wayne and not the Lil Wayne you hear when he raps on pop songs. Unlike his appearances in songs like Jay Sean’s “Down,” in this album Weezy is back to rapping about his crazy life and his flow isn’t hindered by the tracks of others. The whole album has the quintessential Weezy lyrical form that builds up himself and his crew and makes references using similes. He sings “I’m just so ahead of my time like dog years,” and “I’m a young god, swagga un-flawed / Bitch I’m in the building, you in the front yard,” all in the first track “Gonorrhea.” It starts the album off with a bang and sets up the rest of the album—a joy ride of curse words, sex, and degradation of all other rappers.
The album features the real Lil Wayne to such an extent that even the effects of his famous cups of lean—cough syrup and vodka—can be heard throughout. “I’m Single” is dreamy and unaffected at the same time. He speaks almost objectively about breaking up with his girlfriend rapping, “Damn, she text me all day and night / So pissed off, she ain’t even spelling shit right / I text her back and tell her it’s life / Now somebody tell them ho’s I’m single for the night.” All of his songs include some aspect that alludes to Weezy’s current life—not the one of imprisonment, but the one of the decadence he was living when he started recording this album—but it is particularly noticeable in this track, which has Lil Wayne bragging about everything he can do as a single man.
Because the album is a manifestation of Lil Wyane himself, most of the songs are energetic, fast and continually building up the beat. However, “I Am Not a Human Being” also includes slower tracks like “With You,” which serve to break up what may have been a monotonous album. The title track even brings in elements of rock, which Weezy has been trying to incorporate into his style. This song does it right, unlike his past attempts. It includes recordings of real session musicians rather than from a synthesizer, but a beat that keeps it grounded in hip-hop roots.
The last portion of the album is a tribute to Lil Wayne’s label Young Money Entertainment and the songs are accordingly named “YM Banger” and “YM Salute.” Six of the 13 people on the label play some part in these two songs, and two other artists, Lil Twist and Nicki Minaj, are featured in some other part of the album as well. “I Am Not a Human Being” serves as kind of a debut of the record label and it highlights its strengths and weaknesses. The group works very well cohesively, but mainly because a couple of the people on the label, like Drake and Lil Twist, sing or rap with the same nasally voice that Lil Wayne has trademarked. This makes it a little bit confusing to pick out the other artists from Lil Wayne at times, and doesn’t have the intended effect of introducing new artists to the audience.
“I Am Not a Human Being” puts all of Lil Wayne’s current life on display. It provides tons of quick, adoptable one-liners and is driven by raw energy. Even though it slows down in some places, it doesn’t ever cut out the intensity. Though at face value it seems like one big ego trip for Weezy, it’s easy to ride along on the trip and adopt hisrockstar attitude.

Led by Antony Hegarty, the British singer-songwriter, composer and visual artist, Antony and the Johnsons have created a revelatory world of their own in “Swanlight.” This fourth album showcases a further development in musical artistry while maintaining the group’s unique style. Through soulful vocal expression and dynamic instrumentation, Antony and the Johnsons create a sublime alternate universe to be experienced and felt. ”Swanlights” is a spiritual journey and an attempt to free the soul from haunting pasts.
Even the cover image—a piece by Hegarty from his series, “Cut Away the Bad”—speaks to this mission. In response to the horrific images of hunted animals, the environmental advocate created this collection as a way of restoring the “essence” and the “dignity” of the dying animal by cutting away the image of the hunter and traps.
The successful, yet peculiar first minute of the album can only be described by the cliché adage “less is more.” Here, the simplicity of “Everything is New” acts to cleanse ears of whatever chaos surrounds, and prepares listeners for the journey of self-reflection in the ten tracks that follow. The intermittent piano flowing in and out like the tide paints an aural image of a plunge into the ocean: from the calm lapping of the tide to the cymbals mimicking the crashing of waves, with piano and violins phrases rocking back and forth with the movement of the imaginary waters. It is a fitting introduction to the next track, “The Great White Ocean.” As vast as the ocean, this track dives into hearts and impels them to recall deep affections for loved ones.
Especially reflective and redemptive is the track “Ghost.” The lyrics speak of renewal: “Leave behind your shadows’ memories / Leave me / This is your day.” The instrumentation communicates this mood as well, the piano and strings forming a strong partnership. The energetic piano drives the momentum while the collection of strings provides specialized melodic accents. This combination, with the added charge of Hegarty’s emotional vocals, conjures an intense, rocking spiritual energy.
Björk appears on “Flétta”—roughly translated from Italian as “slaughter”—to create a truly beautiful vision contrary to its title. The clarity of Björk’s voice complements the purity of Hegarty’s. Together, they express a unique soulfulness with the brilliant emotion consistent throughout the rest of the album.
Even the arrangement of “Swanlights” speaks to its ability to convey its own, distilled and introspective world. Throughout the album, Hegarty employs strategically-placed pauses in instrumentation and in vocals to emphasize delicate tones and allow for moments of reflection. Despite the interspersed musical pauses, one track flows naturally and unnoticeably into another. These seamless transitions between songs sew “Swanlights” together as one masterpiece rather than a collection of individual tracks.
Antony and the Johnsons have always created music that sounds simple despite its complex instrumentation. It is almost as though they are distilling a chaos of information and emotion into one harmonic aura in an otherworldly way. “Swanlight” carries on this tradition and does still more. It can reawaken souls, inspire revelations and remind us of the true beauty of music in an alternate, redemptive reality.

In recent years, Sufjan Stevens has become known for taking on large-scale ambitious projects. In 2003, after the release of “Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State”, a collection of 21 folk songs about the singer’s home state, Stevens announced that he planned to make an album for every state. In 2005, he released the 22-song “Come On Feel the Illinoise,” but since then has seemingly given up on this colossal idea. Instead, Stevens began working on an equally massive project about the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, which culminated in the release of an album and original film entitled “The BQE” in 2009. Though his previous indie-folk albums feature an array of instruments including banjo, horns, flute, and oboe,  “The BQE” is entirely orchestral and was performed by a 36-member orchestra.
Although “The Age of Adz,” Sufjan Stevens’s most recent release, is not inspired by any specific setting, it is just as grand as any of his undertakings. This time around, a host of synthesizers and electronic sounds are added to the already dense orchestration. His voice wanders and strains more, distinguishing it from the passive whispering used almost too often in the past. The greater intensity in his voice combined with the complex layering of sounds can be overwhelming at first. However, the sheer magnificence of the album eventually reveals itself as moving and emotive rather than overdone.
The album is most rewarding when the electronic and the orchestral compliment each other. “Get Real Get Right” combines horn swells and woodwind trills with a strong metallic beat and robotic noises. In the breakdown, the wind instruments and beat drop out, leaving Stevens to holler over top a single synthesized riff. When the horns eventually re-enter, even more majestic than before, the songs builds into a riveting, epic fury. “I Want to Be Well” accomplishes a similar feat through the vocal arrangements. As a choir chants, “I want to be well,” the track slowly builds until it eventually erupts with a pulsating beat and Stevens’s vigorous yells: “I’m not fuckin’ around!”
The track that demands the most patience and attention is also arguably the best. The last track “Impossible Soul” is a 25 minute journey that morphs hypnotically through several distinct suites. Despite its colossal length, the track never lets up, with each new melody just as aurally stimulating as the one before it. Thirteen minutes in, after a section of autotuned vocals, mournful piano chords, and what can only be described as the sound of cats screeching, “Impossible Soul” morphs surreptitiously into a danceable, disco-inspired single-along. “Boy we could do much more together,” Stevens and choir sing over blaring horns, swirling strings, and the—by this point expected—backdrop of ambient noises. After twisting the chanted melody into complete chaos, Stevens steps back and reflects. “Boy we made such a mess together”, he sings in hindsight, ending the track, and album, as simply as they began.
The success of Sufjan Stevens’s previous projects comes from his unbelievable ability to capture the essence, whether it be the history, sentiments, or the nostalgia, of a location through music. Yet “Age of Adz” shows that even without a central theme in which to ground his ingenuity, he is still able to create an album that is at once stirring and wildly inventive. This triumph is not the result of the place he chooses to write about, but of the sheer magnitude of his ambition—the scope of which no other musician could begin to device—which has repeatedly culminated in his albums. Although he may never make an album about the great state of Massachusetts, it is safe to say that whatever Sufjan Stevens decides to do next will be no less majestic.

Fourteen years after the release of their first album, Belle and Sebastian still understand what it takes to sound young, delightful, and most importantly, in love. “Write About Love” is timeless—true to the band’s sound with fun, foot-tapping, head bobbing tunes and raw, romantic, guy-girl ballads. While it will draw praise from their initial fan base, the album is also being released at a time when its theme and style will appeal to fans of small budget, soundtrack-oriented, young-love films like “Juno” and “500 Days of Summer.” The album explores the different facets of love—some tracks wax flirtatious, some romantic, and others nostalgic.
With love as the core of the album, it’s no surprise that some of the best tracks feature back-and-forth dialogue as well as overlapping harmonies between the male and female singers. “I Didn’t See it Coming” starts off with soft, surrendering female vocals, but then blossoms with lead male singer Stuart Murdoch’s lighthearted sound and an unexpected but fresh electronic bridge. The song is also one of the album’s standout due to its surprising use of washy distorted synths which, when dreamily layered over meshing male and female vocals, reminds listeners of a 1980s dance floor.
Belle and Sebastian also evoke young love through their light instrumentation and lyrics to match. “I Want the World to Stop” has a swirly, half-mellow, half-feel-good sound. The sultry repetition of “I want the world to stop / Give me the morning / Give me the understanding,” echoing off into the background is reminiscent of long, sleepless, lovesick nights. By pushing and pulling at the perfect moments—the vocals fading in and out and exchanging lines with one another—the band creates a catchy pop song full of whimsy, toying with sound as love toys with young souls.
“Come On Sister,” while a more upbeat song, still reminds listeners of what it feels like to be a teenager foolishly in love. Joyful piano scales and arpeggios run up and down in the background, and above it is sung “I can’t sleep, no I can’t sleep... / And it’s fun thinking of you like a movie star.” The song too evokes memories of being a silly adolescent who privately (and futilely) idolizing one’s crushes.
However, other attempts at playful songwriting sometimes flop, due to lyrics that don’t make sense. The title track, “Write About Love,” featuring guest singer Carey Mulligan, sounds clever and witty musically with its abrupt pauses and fluctuating melodies, but unfortunately, its lyrics can’t match the task. In fact, writing about love never seemed so scattered and confusing; ironically, the band opens the song by singing “I know a spell / That would make you well / Write about love, it could be in any tense, but it must make sense.” The rest of the song never clearly relates to the initial theme, with Murdoch singing about taking his lunch up to the roof of his office building and praying. Nevertheless, the song’s melody (which at times is reminiscent of the sped-up, Beach Boys-ified version of The Mamas & The Papas’ “California Dreaming”) is captivating, and makes it a worthwhile single.
Though through the course of the album love loses a bit of its excitement, there is only one real sore track on the album—“Calculating Bimbo.” With its uninteresting melody, it could easily be mistaken for a sleepy, old fashioned wedding song. Only halfway through does the band attempt to salvage the song in a minor-key interlude. Just when the track starts to get intriguing though, it returns to its initial lifelessness.
Despite this weak point, Belle and Sebastian, completely redeem themselves with the poignant finale, “Sunday’s Pretty Icons,” which ties together all the themes of love they have been exploring through the course of the album. The song not only starts by bringing all of the vocalists together as one, but it also transitions beautifully into a series of guy/girl responses. Furthermore, it grows from a youthful whisper into an enveloping blanket of sound supported by an amazing instrumental ending. After listening to the stripped-down “Read The Blessed Pages” listeners are rewarded with this powerful love anthem.
By mentioning “Every girl you ever admired / Every boy you ever desired / Every love you ever forgot” in this final track, Belle and Sebastian flood listeners with fanciful memories and good vibrations. They are fairly successful in conveying these feelings throughout “Write About Love,” reminding fans how fun it is to listen to the sounds of love.

An image that runs through Bragi Ólafsson’s “The Ambassador” is that of “the house on the hill / which we face towards / the mother, the window / the darkness of shadows.” This is an excerpt from one of the poems written by the main protagonist, Sturla Jón. The shadows that Sturla describes in his poem are echoed in his own life—he has a dark past and troubling recollections of his family—but like the figure of the mother in his poem, they are more of a presence than a force. Sturla’s troubles never quite germinate into something that can be resolved, but rather inform Sturla’s character in a way that’s far more realistic. He’s moved beyond the time in his life for tragedy, but these memories still shape his interactions with the world and other people. “The Ambassador” provides a close study of a few key days in the life of its quirky protagonist. But while its meditations on Sturla’s all-too-human conflicts are interesting, they are not compelling enough to carry Ólafsson’s novel.
Sturla is a middle-aged Icelandic poet travelling to a poetry festival in Lithuania. He is prone to remarking on his role as an ambassador of his small nation to this other, even more out-of-the-way place. But though he makes it clear that he is reading his poetry as a representative of Iceland, he is not entirely sure that wants to be a poet anymore. He’s not quite sure what his poetry means—in fact, he’s not sure that poets should know what their poetry means at all. He seems far more worried about the fact that he’s lost the hazelnut he’d picked up as a good luck charm than he does about poetic matters.
Sturla’s listlessness informs the tone of the entire novel. Divorced, Sturla works as the superintendent of an apartment building, and seems slightly at a loss for finding meaning in his writing. He seems to feel far more deeply about the overcoat that he loses than he does about his poetry. He drinks with an almost religious fervor—a trait shared by most of the people who surround him. As the book unfolds, the shadows of his past are revealed (the details of his relationships with his family are rather dark) but it is never entirely clear how much they really disturb him. This gives a realistic quality to the novel; though the past exists, 22 years later, life is centered on other matters. It is never entirely ruled out that Sturla is haunted by his memories, but Ólafsson seems rather to suggest that Sturla, like most people, is only sporadically troubled by the unresolved issues in his life.
The most compelling element of “The Ambassador,” though, is neither Sturla’s childhood nor his poetry, but rather the sporadic strangeness of Sturla’s present character. While he’s not always likeable, he’s entirely believable—even in the almost surreal moments when he justifies stealing someone’s overcoat because someone stole his or wandering into a strip club because of a sense that it’s a ‘writerly’ thing to do. Though he’s often a brutally sarcastic, mocking character, there are times when he shows himself to be very lonely and vulnerable. It’s possible that his is a farce only insofar as the world he sees is a farce—both Sturla and his world are only partially serious. Sturla’s exploits have elements of almost absurd slapstick comedy, but there is something serious in them, too. Though the tics of Sturla’s character are sometimes consuming, they’re not incomprehensible—in a world like this, after all, who doesn’t need a good overcoat?
There’s a kind of dark comedy which has a profoundly cathartic ending—one that is able to resolve the angst underlying a situation by reaffirming more powerful forces in human life, such as solidarity with other people. It seems, at some points in “The Ambassador,” that this is the sort of ending to which Bragi Ólafsson aspires—one with a sense of profound relief as his character finds a source of happiness that does not depend on his career or the international reception of his poetry, but rather on meaningful relationships with others. But, while there is an element of existential drama in the end of “The Ambassador,” Sturla seems too quirky to find this kind of affirmation. He is far too nervous about the idea of not having a good cup of coffee in the evening to really ever be happy.
“The Ambassador” is a novel which is frequently entertaining in its juxtaposition of farce, whimsy, and profound elements of character. It’s unpredictable, and this adds no small measure of interest to the work as a whole—but its unpredictability often seems to result in false starts, and the end concludes far fewer issues than are raised. It also makes it hard to be swept up in the work as a whole, for while Ólafsson manages to portray a great many emotions in the work, few are developed enough to be consistently compelling. Sturla is a man who, despite his profound quirkiness, seems to reflect a great deal of the contemporary soul—but it’s a dim reflection, and much of its depth remains unrealized.

“It’s very funny and very sexy… What more could you want?” asks director Stephen Frears, who delivers his characteristically ironic, British wit in his new adaptation of an adaptation, “Tamara Drewe.” Based on Posy Simmonds’s graphic reimagining of Thomas Hardy’s 1874 novel, “Far from the Madding Crowd,” the film revolves around heiress Tamara, who returns to reclaim her family farm after designing both a new identity and a new nose. Her return sets off a chain reaction of disastrous events.
Though set in a tranquil, rural Dorset village where there are more hills than people, the sequence of action is incredibly fast-paced. In order to achieve that frenetic pace in a serene environment, Frears needed to familiarize himself with it. “I have a house in Dorset, but where we filmed was more beautiful than where my house is. So I had to go out there and learn about it. It’s very, very beautiful,” says Frears.
Filming in Dorset was, overall, a pleasant experience for Frears. He says, “People were very, very kind.” Frears also notes that “Tamara Drewe” is, “quite possibly,” his favorite film so far. “The weather was nice, the countryside was beautiful, the actors were wonderful, and the script was very funny,” he says.
Many of Frears’s films, including both “The Queen” and “Tamara Drewe,” feature strong women. When discussing Tamara’s personality, Frears says, “Well, on the outside she’s strong and looks quite pretty, but on the inside she’s quite frail. So, you know, my guess is she’ll grow up and learn to be a strong woman because she’s made a lot of mistakes. And people tend to learn from their mistakes.”
Some may wonder if the strong female characters Frears includes in his films remind him of people in his own life. “Well, I know lots of women who do silly things. Don’t you?” Frears asks.  “I just know a lot of girls like that who make mistakes. I don’t mind if people make mistakes as long as they learn from them.”
As the film progresses and the adult characters become mired in romantic conflicts, two young female characters add a youthful spark to the film. Frears says that he “liked them [the girls] very, very much” and that he sees himself in their characters. One may wonder how the director sees himself in two teenage girls, but Frears notes that, like the girls, he saw himself as one of the “young people in Britain. Slightly desperate, you know, abandoned. But very spirited.”
Perhaps surprisingly, Frears’ initial attraction to “Tamara Drewe” did not come from either the graphic novel or the original novel. Instead, he was simply attraced to what he thought was a very original script. He says, “I read the script and I thought it was very, very fresh. It made me laugh and it wasn’t like other films. I thought it was great. When I read it I thought it was very funny and very sexy, and I thought people would have a great time, would enjoy the film.”
As for the film’s intended audience, there is no specific targeted group in Frears’ mind. He hopes that the movie will be watched by, “Anybody who likes to laugh. It’s very sort of straightforward isn’t it? You put a film on and people enjoy it.”

Conviction, a word that connotes both the condemnation of a criminal as well as the passionate fervor by which one defends a belief or principle.  Combine the two and you get “Conviction,” starring Sam Rockwell and Hillary Swank. The film is based on the true story of Kenny Waters (Rockwell), who was sentenced to life in prison for a crime he didn’t commit, and his sister Betty Anne (Swank) who subsequently dedicated her life to fighting for his release. Featuring a star-studded cast and a gripping true-life narrative, “Conviction” seems a recipe for box office and award-season success, yet the film veers disappointingly into overly sensational moralizing which frequently trivializes its source material.
With her brother in jail for robbery and murder, the stakes are high for Betty Anne to clear his name.  A high school dropout at the time of Kenny’s conviction, for the sake of her brother, she manages to obtain a GED, a bachelor’s, a master’s in education, and ultimately a law degree. Word of a single mother raising two boys while working part-time and putting herself through law school eventually leads to the enlistment of Barry Scheck, founder of the Innocence Project. The Innocence Project is a non-profit organization that works to exonerate wrongfully convicted individuals through DNA testing which played a large role in helping to achieve Waters’s acquittal.
Beyond the scope of simply telling Kenny and Betty Anne’s account, “Conviction” is also largely the story of both the Innocence Project and the greater struggle of working within a sometimes-flawed system of justice. Sometimes subtly done, mostly this approaches pedagogical moralizing: “You know your father’d be dead right now if Massachusetts had the death penalty,” Betty Anne tells Kenny’s daughter.
Perhaps as a result of the film’s desire to turn Kenny’s story into a moral lesson it simplifies the nuances and complexity. For example, the trial scene almost completely glosses over the specifics of Kenny’s involvement in the crime. From what is actually depicted in the movie it seems that Kenny was convicted on an extremely circumstantial basis—that is, a couple witnesses claiming to have heard Kenny admit to the crime and his blood type matching that of the perpetrator. The only real explanation for how he ended up wrongly charged of murder and robbery is that he didn’t bother to hire a more expensive and more qualified lawyer than the public defender because he was certain of his innocence.
Similarly, the film has a simplistic style so that all involved can focus on the plot. Director Tony Goldwyn engages in an occasional artsy camera angle but the film’s cinematography is underemphasized. Construction of the scenes is fairly straightforward and thus better attests to the weight of the narrative. However, the problem with “Conviction” arises when the arresting (no pun intended) account repeatedly devolves into mere theatrical melodrama.
Nowhere is this more evident than in Hillary Swank’s acting. A two-time Academy award-winning actress, Swank seems to have a natural predilection for heart-wrenching roles where she plays an underdog protagonist who ends up on top only through her hard work and perseverance. That may have worked for her in “Boys Don’t Cry” and “Million Dollar Baby”—nonetheless it not only falls completely short for her in “Conviction,” but also comes off as picturesque peddling to a sympathetic audience.
Swank’s acting may be fairly exaggerated but to her credit this may be due in part to the enormously overdramatic script. While visiting with brother Kenny in jail, Swank pleads, “You just have to promise me that you’ll never give up!” The script is pockmarked with clichés and perhaps bears most of the blame for Swank’s over-the-top performance.
Yet, while much of “Conviction” is overdone, not all of the performances are quite as bad as Swank’s. Sam Rockwell is very effective in his role as Kenny Waters, a character whose ethics are deliberately ambiguous. For though Betty Anne is certain of his innocence, Rockwell is able to convey the fine line Kenny walked between being a good person at heart yet also prone to violence. Minnie Driver, who serves as an ironic foil for Swank’s character, also adds a degree of realism to the film.
The writing isn’t always sensationalized, though, and sometimes manages to maintain an element of humor that balances out some of the intensity evident in other parts of the scripts. Betty Anne’s son, who fixes up a place for Kenny to live upon his expected release, exemplifies this when he says, “At least Uncle Kenny’ll  think it’s nice…compared to jail.”
“Conviction” is entertaining and funny but very much a production. Understandably, the film ends on the happy note of the case of Kenny Waters finally brought to justice, but chooses to omit the fact that he passed away only six months later after spending nearly a third of his life in prison for a crime of which he was innocent.  Between its didactic aspect and its tweaking of the truth, “Conviction” is definitely a missed opportunity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My mother once told me that almost all of current American culture is centered on baby boomers, generally regarded as those born between 1946 and the late 1950s. When boomers started having kids, she says, people started talking about the best way to raise kids. When the boomers’ babies started going to college, people started talking about the high costs of college.
My mother also told me that the boomers are in denial about getting old, her explanation for the explosive popularity of erectile dysfunction drugs. I’m not entirely sure about the truth of her theory, but the movie “Red” makes a lot more sense when considered in that light, especially because the first generation of boomers will begin to retire in January of next year. “Red” is a glorification of retirees and a testament to their desire to remain young.
Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is a retired black-ops CIA agent whose house is blown to pieces when he is attacked by a government-issue hitman (Karl Urban) for reasons unknown to him. Of course, he turns to his old friends, played by Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, and John Malkovich, for help, and numerous artillery-heavy adventures ensue on the way to finding out the truth behind Moses’s near-elimination. Eventually they come to the conclusion that they must kill the Vice President of the United States, and the movie turns into a variation of Ocean’s Eleven (or any heist film).
Willis, Freeman, Malkovich, and Mirren are perfect in their roles as unbelievably skilled former-CIA agents. As Moses, Willis is in top shape in “Red,” always one-step ahead of his opponents both physically and mentally. He manages to make Urban look small and unskilled in their fight scenes— “You just got your ass handed to you by a goddamn retiree,” says the hitman’s boss.
Freeman’s character is dying of cancer in a nursing home, but he still commands a domineering presence. Similarly, Malkovich, starring as a hilariously paranoid, armaments-obsessed man, is one of the sharpest tools in the shed. Mirren is perhaps most fearsome in her role, pumping out machine gun rounds with elegant ease and killing men without the blink of a perfectly made-up eye. With these particular actors in the roles of super-spies, “Red” places retirees on a pedestal. Because of their age and experience, these characters are always smarter, faster, and badder than any of the young whippersnappers that they have to contend with. In the same way, the older, more time-tested actors are simply better in their roles than the younger actors in the film.
Speaking of younger actors, the inclusion of Mary-Louise Parker as Willis’s love interest in the film is an odd choice. In reality, Parker and Willis are about 10 years apart in age, but the film conveys the sense that Parker’s character is much younger than Willis’s through her speech, dress, and aversion to Willis’s bald head. Her purpose in the movie is unclear; she seems to either function as a reminder that the other main characters are much older than she is or as a layman suitably impressed by how cool and crazy the older spies are. Her chemistry with Willis is unconvincing, probably because the circumstances of their meeting are so ludicrous, but her comedic skills are on par with those she employs in “Weeds,” especially in the early scenes when she is duct-taped, bound, and driven across several states, furiously protesting in the face of Willis’s patronizing calm.
Maybe Frank Moses’s love for Parker’s character represents his love of youth and his desire to continue to live a young life, even with the perks of experience and understanding that come with being older. And maybe the comedy that imbues the film is a mask for the more serious specter of aging and death that haunts the main characters throughout the film. After all, when all is said and done, “Red” is about what really matters in life when death is dangerously close.
But despite its thematic material, “Red” is not a film targeted solely at baby boomers, despite my mother’s conspiratorial thoughts about American culture. All ages and demographics should get a kick out of the film, and most will probably wish that they could be badass enough  to be classified “Retired, Extremely Dangerous” in old age.

“Human Chain,” the newest collection from Nobel Prize-winning poet Seamus Heaney, is filled with the sounds of different languages. “Is scíth mo chrob ón scríbainn” is the title of the first part of one poem; spirits are described as “animae, quibus altera fato Corpora debentur” in another; Guilleric’s “Herbier de Bretagne” is the source material for a third. Although Heaney writes primarily in English, it does not quite do his work justice to describe him as a solely English-language poet. Even when he does not directly cite source languages, the influences of Latin, Irish, Anglo-Saxon, and even a little French course through and shape his poetry.
The many source languages in “Human Chain” are not new developments in Heaney’s work. From excerpts of Virgil’s “Eclogues” to the Anglo-Saxon epic “Beowulf”, Heaney has proved himself time and again as a translator, and his scholarship of other languages is evident in much of his own poetry. This latest collection is not remarkable for any change in the poet’s style or subject. Rather, just as there are echoes of other languages in his verse, there are also echoes of his earlier poems, as Heaney returns to and refines many of the themes that pervade his career.
The experience of a young child picking fruit in the summertime, which Heaney depicted so memorably in “Blackberry-Picking,” from his collection “Death of a Naturalist,” returns once more in “Derry Derry Down.” In “Blackberry-Picking, he described the first ripening berry as “At first, just one, a glossy purple clot,” and recalled the wounds received while collecting the fruit: “Our hands were peppered / with thorn pricks.” Heaney recounts a similar memory in “Derry Derry Down”: “The lush / sunset blush / on a big ripe // Gooseberry: / I scratched my hand / Reaching in // To gather it / Off the bush, / Unforbidden...” But the echoes of Heaney’s earlier work enrich, rather than overwhelm, his newer poem, which still stands well as a separate entity. Its verse form is completely different from the pentameter of “Blackberry-Picking”; short lines are grouped into three-line stanzas, giving rise to a remarkable series of vivid but compressed images.
Heaney himself addresses the idea of echoed meaning and sound in his poem, “An Old Refrain.” In one section, he lists the images and sensations he connects with the sounds of particular words: “In ‘seggins’ / Hear the wind / Among the sedge, //… // In ‘easing’ / Drips of night rain / from the eaves.” Each word, the poet seems to argue, already brings with it an array of associations based on its sound and shape. Heaney is highly adept at using these associations to his advantage, a skill that is particularly evident in the poem “Eelworks,” where he depicts the strange feeling of catching an eel, rather than a fish: “not the utter / Flip-stream frolic-fish / But a foot-long // Slither of a fellow, / A young eel, greasy grey / And rightly wriggle-spined.” With these kennings (“Flip-stream,” “frolic-fish,” “wriggle-spined”), Heaney evokes not only the rhythm of Anglo-Saxon poetry, but also the very particular sound and movement of a flopping fish and a wriggling eel.
And of course, Ireland—its language, landscape, its history, and its mythology—is a constant presence throughout the collection. In the poem “Loughanure,” Heaney references a story about Caoilte and a fairy hill, while later, in “Wraiths,” he speaks of the Sidhe, one of the fairy peoples of early Irish mythology. But Heaney does not limit himself to the stories of early Ireland; his poetry is also informed by the country’s tumultuous modern history. In an earlier poem, “Casualty,” Heaney remembered Bloody Sunday: “PARAS THIRTEEN, the walls said / BOGSIDE NIL.” Now, in “Route 110,” the poet asks: “And what in the end was there left to bury / Of Mr. Lavery... Or of Louis O’ Neill / In the wrong place the Wednesday they buried // Thirteen who’d been shot in Derry?”
“Route 110” is perhaps the most stunning work in the collection. Calling on classical, rather than Celtic, mythology, it is a twelve-part poem in which the speaker maps out his own life, starting with the purchase of a book and his bus ride home, against the journey of Aeneas into Avernus. Although the mythology that Heaney invokes has been used by generations of poets before him, he uses this resonance to his advantage. As he pairs the speaker’s ordinary trip with his mythological vision, he focuses on the most striking images from classical mythology. In “racks of suits and overcoats that swayed” the speaker sees “their owners’ shades close-packed on Charon’s barge.” In the memory of his own bitter romance, he recalls Virgil’s description of the sight of Dido’s shade: “As one when the month is young sees a new moon / Fading into daytime.”
As he returns to ancient mythology, old memories, and early poems, Heaney is aware of his own age. He seems to posit, however, that even in his status as an aging poet, he can re-imagine the experiences of his youth: “As my uncertainty on stairs / Is more and more the lighteheadedness / Of a cabin boy’s first time on the rigging... It’s not that I can’t imagine still / That slight untoward rupture and world-tilt / As a wind freshened and the anchor weighed.” From the memory of sweet summer fruit to the grief for the thirteen men in Derry; from Anglo-Saxon kennings to Latinate similes, Heaney does not shy from revisiting memories and reusing literary techniques. Rather, he returns to them in his maturity with a fresh—if aged—poetic eye to create, in “Human Chain,” an astonishing new collection.

Meeting new people always poses a number of problems. There’s obviously the issue of making a good first impression. The most difficult problem, however, is posed by the very real possibility that you won’t like the people you end up meeting—that you are obligated to spend the next few hours with individuals you have no intention of getting to know better. Stephen Frears’s new film “Tamara Drewe” unfortunately forces such a situation onto the viewer, combining a cast of unlikeable characters with a convoluted, unfocused plot that work together to create a largely frustrating viewing experience.
“Tamara Drewe”—in an extreme display of today’s obsession with adaptations—is based on the comic strip by Posy Simmonds, which is itself a modernization of the Thomas Hardy novel “Far from the Madding Crowd”. The film transfers the story to an idyllic British town that is shaken apart by the return of Tamara (Gemma Arterton), coming back home to start a new career in journalism, both with new confidence and, more importantly, a new nose. Tamara draws the attention of Nick (Roger Allam), a philandering author whose home is currently functioning as a writers’ retreat; Andy (Luke Evans), an old friend and flame of Tamara’s who works on Nick’s property; and Ben (Dominic Cooper), a drumming, leather-wearing, earring-sporting bad boy who is in town with his band.
With a premise that already requires a diagram to sort through, Frears’s direction only serves to heighten the feeling of confusion and mayhem throughout the film. At times he is successful in adding a playful charm, poking fun at the story’s absurdity with quick cuts into Jody’s teenage fantasies, or using effects that heighten the lack of realism, such as the occasional split-screen or title card. Unfortunately he displays little of the control he showed in directing “The Queen,” 2006’s Oscar-nominated biopic—whereas in that film he accomplished a fine balance between sharp humor and heavy drama, here his attempts at barely-controlled mayhem give way to a sprawling, convoluted series of romantic and sexual liaisons that seem to have little point other than to show every possible pairing within the cast.
Of course, as primetime soaps prove time and again, watching endless romantic entanglements can be rewarding with engaging characters. Unfortunately, this is precisely what “Tamara Drewe” lacks. The titular Tamara is infuriatingly insensitive, flitting from one suitor to another regardless of the harm she causes, and—most frustratingly—it seems the audience is constantly expected to sympathize with her actions. At one point we see her crying in her car after seeing Andy with another woman while she herself had been seeing Ben, with everything from the muted lighting to a score heavy with melancholic strings indicating that this is a ‘touching moment’.
The one odd exception to this rule is the ever-present character of the British countryside itself. Frears and cinematographer Ben Davis highlight the breathtaking beauty of the Dorset landscape, with the camera framing characters in long shots that emphasize their surroundings, or casting lingering gazes over rolling hills, stone houses, and the simple goings-on of everyday life. These moments act as tiny islands of calm amidst the swirling chaos around them, and one only wishes that Frears could have maintained that sense of control throughout the film’s entirety.
As “Tamara Drewe” careens wildly from partnership to partnership, from love to sex to betrayal all the way to its surreal climax, it is easy to let one’s attention wander, and to begin to question what the point of this exercise was—perhaps how one ended up spending two hours with this group of selfish, libido-driven individuals. But soon enough the film comes to a close, and while the film on the whole may not have been a total waste, it’s pretty clear that “Tamara Drewe,” like so many chance acquaintances, is an encounter you’d just as soon forget.

“We are all just looking for an opportunity to be a hero,” says M. Ray Williams, the first Director of Education at the Harvard Art Museums. Williams refers to the Sackler Museum’s “Stories: The Epic Tradition” series, which consists of three sets of performances held two weeks apart on Wednesday afternoons and evenings through November 10. Storyteller Xanthe Gresham performed the Shahnameh epic during the first event last Wednesday.
The Shahnameh performance celebrated the millennial anniversary of the poem written by Ferdowsi, and long considered the masterpiece of medieval Persian poetry. “The museum has a small installation all about the story, so it seemed like the perfect reason to bring in a storyteller who specialized in this material,” Williams says.
The afternoon performances of the series are aimed at children, while evening shows are directed at adult audiences. The matinee show focuses on stories more appropriate for children, becoming interactive for these younger attendees.
“It is a natural thing to sit and listen; it’s nice to sit and tell stories to different generations,” Xanthe Gresham says.
“We have a mostly student and adult audience here at the museum, so this was an experiment to see if we could appeal to an after-school crowd,” Williams says. Although few children attended the first day, Williams hopes that this will change and allow these epics to reach a broader audience.
Attendees such as Cambridge resident Naomi C. Stephens and her friend Sabrina S. Dejoannis valued the exciting material and Gresham’s method of delivery. “I had really high hopes, and this is wonderful; this was a great performance,” Dejoannis says.
Stephens also appreciated that the series brings unfamiliar stories to a new audience. “Children [from places like Bangladesh] read these like children here read fairy tales,” Stephens explains.
Gresham agrees that epics are still relevant in the modern world. “When you tell a story you appeal to the child in the adult. Stories are a healing thing, but you can’t say how or why,” she says. “Through the ages people have used stories [in] different ways—that, in fact, is how religions use stories—but every storyteller has to be responsible for what meaning they want to get across to the audience.”
“We like something big in our lives, because our lives are small in comparison,” Gresham adds. “Epic characters, mythical characters, have big actions and big feelings—our actions will never be as big as their actions, but our feelings are. So when you put them into epic context we get an epic space for our epic feelings. Even if our own actions seem small, the epic will make them huge.”
The excitement surrounding Gresham’s storytelling inspired Williams to schedule additional performances devoted to the epic. “Having a storytelling series provides another link to art that we don’t normally display in the galleries,” Williams says. “Our audience isn’t necessarily expecting storytelling. They are expecting art history lectures—this is what we’ve taught them to expect—so it just seemed like it would be thoughtful in terms of building momentum to have a series of stories.”
Continuing the series, storyteller Odds Bodkin takes the stage next with a performance of the Odyssey on October 27. The final presentation will be of the Ramayana on November 10, performed by Surabhi Shah and Mesma Belsare. This new version of the Ramayana will be told through the perspectives of three female characters, bringing novelty to a canonical text. These storytellers also plan to integrate such forms as dance and music into their presentations.
Even with these new interpretations of classic pieces, the core of the performances remains to tell stories of the human experience. As Williams says, “These stories, even when they are from long ago and far away—they speak to us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Elif I. Batuman ’99 paused as she read from her new collection of autobiographical essays, “The Possessed: Adventures with Russian Books and the People Who Read Them.” At a passing reference to the white gates of Yasnaya Polyana, Leo Tolstoy’s estate, she glanced at the audience with a grin and interjected: “Spoiler alert. This is actually a very cleverly placed detail.”
The gates are one of the locations Batuman visits during her investigation of whether Leo Tolstoy was murdered. A piece chronicling the matter, titled “The Murder of Leo Tolstoy: A Forensic Investigation,” ran in Harper’s Magazine last year, but the research began in Stanford’s comparative literature department. Batuman has built a career around straddling the divide between academia and creative writing, alternating between literary criticism and essays on topics from comedy traffic school to the return of Lowell House’s Danilov bells to Russia.
Batuman’s talk last Friday, hosted by the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at the Center for Government and International Studies, quickly departed from the content of “The Possessed,” as she engaged in repartee with the audience about her travels in Turkey, Russia, and Uzbekistan, and the challenges of balancing creative and academic work.
“When you write a book, you’re always having to talk about it,” she said. “Mine is very small, and is partially about its own writing, so [book talks] get really, really meta, really, really fast.” She then discussed the implications of her controversial review of Mark McGurl’s “The Program Era,” in which she criticized graduate creative writing programs for their “relentless paring down, and transforming of ‘writing’ into ‘technique.’”
“If you feel like writing is inherently self-indulgent, then don’t do it,” she said.
Throughout the event, Batuman returned to her conviction that creative writers should practice their craft “in conversation” with the existing literary canon. “What if,” she said, “instead of imitating ‘Lost Illusions’ and living in a garret in New York and just writing poetry and making love, you go to Balzac’s house, and read everything you can by him, and then write?”
The attendees focused their questions on the overlap of academia with fiction and creative non-fiction. When one asked whether there was “something that you can’t get from fiction that you can get from academic writing,” Batuman exclaimed: “Yeah, the truth! I used to be only concerned with beauty in fiction, but I’ve learned that truth and beauty overlap.”
The conversation touched briefly on the reactions that the people Batuman describes in “The Possessed” have had to the book’s often irreverent depiction of academia. She acknowledged that one person had been angry upon reading the book, while others were uncomfortable with their portrayals, but pleased that the humor would attract interest to Russian literature.
“When you write memoir,” Batuman said, “you write about your life, and at some point it intersects with other lives, and the perceptions aren’t always the same. The tradition in memoir is not that you call people up and make sure everything’s true, because it’s about one person’s perspective.”
She admitted some trepidation about her recent success. “When you  achieve even a tiny amount of success, your life changes and becomes  less like real life,” she said. “I’ve done less writing this year [while  promoting the book] than I have since I was seven. In this book, I can  sort of be belligerent and make certain jokes, but when people start  being nice to you and inviting you to Harvard, you sort of stop doing  that—you have to be careful.”
This need to consider how an audience will react to her writing can be  paralyzing, Batuman said. “Ultimately I have to just sit down and write,  and then worry about what people will think later... Usually you wait  for everyone to be dead and then you write. But I can’t wait that long.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’m a little embarrassed by the fact that I check my mailbox daily. But I do love getting mail, especially mail from home. For me reading a letter is like a short trip away from Cambridge, a reminder of the scope of the world outside--outside of Harvard and outside of me. Yet that feeling, though itself sweet, has a certain bitter aftertaste. Letters from home leave me with an unsettling question: if I loved the place so much, why’d I leave?
It’s a question that stings. And maybe it’s an unfair question; many leave home for college or work, whether half a state or half a world away. My own parents moved away for school, leaving the small Appalachian coal town in eastern Kentucky (Inez, two creeks past Tomahawk—blink as you pass the stoplight and you’ll miss it) where generations of their families had lived. But, unlike their somewhat-economically motivated decision, my choice seems to me terribly free, a decision motivated more by some yearning opposite to my affection for home than by any necessity.
I could cite academic and career motivations, but there’s some less-easily explained impulse at the root of that decision, some kind of wanderlust. It’s an impulse that I feel poems and songs have come much closer to explaining than I have.
When I do find something that expresses an unresolved feeling like that, I get attached to it immediately. I listened to Led Zeppelin’s “Going to California” an embarrassing number of times this summer. To illustrate: it takes one hour and 45 minutes to mow my lawn—or just one Led Zeppelin song on repeat. The song, said to be inspired by Robert Plant and Jimmy Page’s mutual affection for Joni Mitchell, is a gentle mix of acoustic guitar, mandolin, and Plant’s voice at his most achingly restrained.
For me it’s become a song that not only describes but manifests my impulse to leave home. When I hear Plant sing “Someone told me there’s a girl out there / With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair,” I feel that longing for something other, something new, and I can understand—if not exactly why I left, at least what feeling made it possible for me to leave.
Only recently have I come any closer to understanding. I’m a sucker for seasonal art. Sufjan Stevens’s Christmas album will become my homework soundtrack as soon as Thanksgiving’s out. So it’s no surprise that I looked up Mary Oliver’s poem “October” midway through this month; however, Oliver’s insight into that very feeling I’ve been struggling to understand entirely surprised me.
It is, on the surface, a poem about a bear waking up in the cold weather to stalk its prey; but the last few lines, from the perspective of the hunted, felt to me like the roots of that longing to wander: “Look, I want to love this world / as though it’s the last chance I’m ever going to get / to be alive / and know it [...] and I thought / so this is the world. / I’m not in it. / It is beautiful.”
I couldn’t at first understand why that poem reminded me of leaving home, but I think now I’ve begun to figure it out: is it possible that part of my leaving home was not so much wanting to leave behind the familiar as wanting to leave behind myself. That is, to escape the feeling that I understood my surroundings, the feeling—no matter how illusory—that I somehow controlled my surroundings? Isn’t there something beautiful about coming somewhere both new to us and somehow free from us, some beauty we can see only when forcefully freed from the inescapable but illusive conviction that we already understand our surroundings?
It’s a sentiment I find echoed by one of my favorite poets, Gerard Manley Hopkins, who coupled the self-denial befitting his priesthood with an enthusiastic, inexorable affirmation of the goodness of all that is wild and challenging, new to us and outside our control: “O let them be left, wildness and wet; / Long live the weeds and the wilderness yet.”
I wrote a story a couple weeks ago for a fiction workshop. It’s about a character living in Kentucky around the turn of the twentieth century, a character who leaves home around the age of 20 and returns only 20 years later when his father is deathly ill. The biggest problem my classmates had with the plot was a simple matter of motivation, something I’d glossed over in telling the story of a character whose identity was otherwise bound up with his Kentucky heritage: why did he leave in the first place? I thought about it much since class, but I’m still not sure how to answer that question. Why does anybody leave?

On Oct. 12, U.S. District Judge Virginia A. Phillips issued a landmark injunction, ordering the Pentagon to stop enforcing the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy whereby gay members of the military who display their sexual orientation are discharged. Phillip’s ruling held that the policy “irreparably injures service members by infringing their fundamental rights.” Gay rights groups have applauded the decision, the Department of Justice has argued that this was a matter for the Congress, and DADT proponents have argued the policy itself is necessary to protect military morale and unit cohesion in wartime. Indeed, the latter two arguments are misguided. Judge Phillips acted rightly in striking down a law that violates Constitutional protections.
This ruling was a clear exercise of proper judicial power. Federal judges are obligated to strike down unconstitutional laws, and Judge Phillips correctly observed that DADT violates the rights to due process, freedom of speech, and petition. Furthermore, it is an important function of the judiciary to concentrate its attention on laws that target minorities who cannot protect themselves through the democratic process; the court serves as an important balance against potential tyranny of the majority. The most admirable parts of American judicial history have been when the courts stepped in to do just that—ruling legalized prejudice not only immoral, but also unconstitutional.
Yet this injunction does not excuse the administration or Congress for their actions regarding DADT. Although it is the judiciary’s responsibility to overturn unconstitutional laws, both the Obama administration and Congress should have done far more to stop DADT before the courts had to come into play. Congress could and should have simply repealed DADT long ago.
Likewise, this injunction gives President Barack H. Obama the opportunity to deliver a long overdue statement on DADT, living up to the commitment he made during his campaign of repealing the law. At this time, the President can also take real action by refusing to appeal Phillips’ decision. The President’s commitment to the legislative process is admirable, but he is not compelled to defend an unconstitutional law.
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates has also wrongfully delayed the process by insisting that a study must be issued before action can be taken on DADT. We understand Gates’s concern about implementing this repeal and his reasons for issuing a study in advance, but persuasive evidence submitted during the trial showed that militaries that allow gay members to serve do not suffer from any of the commonly asserted problems, and there is no reason to suppose the American military would either. Even more importantly, DADT is a moral issue and not something that should be decided based on a study. In this sense, Gates’s concern for the armed forces is admirable but misplaced. He should concern himself instead with doing the right thing, as quickly as possible: supporting the repeal of DADT.  The time for delay, for studies, and for unsubstantiated statements of qualified repeal is over. It is time for all of our nation’s government officials, following Judge Phillips’ example, to oppose this immoral and unconstitutional policy, and end it once and for all.

With all the accents floating around Harvard Yard, why is a “y’all” still accompanied by a head turn and a snicker? Almost twenty percent of the Class of 2014 hails from the South, yet students seem genuinely shocked to meet someone from under the Mason-Dixon line. The haze of stereotypes that surround southerners, ranging from the supposed lack of education in the South to the fact that all Southerners are a little bit racist, is highly offensive. The South has a lot to offer, and Harvard students could do with some Southern charm.
Although I wasn’t born in the South, Charleston, South Carolina has been my home for nearly seventeen years. For most of those seventeen years, I couldn’t wait to get out. At times, the political climate was oppressive, and the sense of tradition was overwhelming. However, once I prepared myself to move to the Northeast, I realized that everything I had found infuriating was actually quirkily endearing.
Let’s talk Southern hospitality. Tourists snake through the Yard, snapping pictures on every single path between the Science Center and Widener steps. Most Harvard students stick to the official policy: Keep your head down and look busy. Would it kill us to offer to take a picture? Would it cause us physical pain to smile as we fall victim to yet another candid shot of a “typical Harvard student?” Just because the weather is frigid doesn’t mean we should be. Aside from hospitality, people in the South give a lot of importance to respect. It makes sense that students and professors should work together as colleagues; however, tacking on a “sir” to the end of an answer isn’t too difficult. There’s something pleasant about that Southern politeness which gives respect without implying deference.
Let’s talk Southern class. The essence of the South lies in the dress code and social mannerisms. Be honest—is the clubbing scene fulfilling? Skirts which leave nothing to the imagination, with music that spells out the acts that are performed on the dance floor, have overstayed their welcome. Polo shirts, slacks, dresses, and cardigans are now such a novelty on a Saturday night. Wouldn’t it be nice to enjoy a touch of class over dinner and a bout of swing dancing? Every girl wants to be swept off her feet—literally.
Finally, let’s talk Southern food. Everybody loves barbeque and would love sweet tea if it were available. Sweet tea adds an infinite amount of deliciousness to any meal. How about grits, a more fatty and buttered-up version of oatmeal? Sign me up for the perfect breakfast food. The most noticeably lacking aspect of Southern cuisine in New England remains the absence of Chick-Fil-A. Any town, especially Cambridge, would benefit from those flaky biscuits and that delectably fried chicken.
The charms of the South could knock sense into any naysayers to the ways of Dixieland. Hopefully, next time a Southerner attempts to bring a piece of home with them, whether it’s in the accent, the food, or the general demeanor, the Harvard community will embrace them with open arms. The South has their stuff figured out. As the line from Sweet Home Alabama goes, “Just ‘cause I talk slow don’t mean I’m stupid.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As we enter the final stretch of the midterm elections, Republicans look poised to take the House and possibly the Senate, as Americans seem to want a different direction for the economy and the country. Before we take that leap, it’s important to examine just what economic policies we will be choosing. The Republicans recently released “The Pledge to America,” a plan that they claim will create jobs and reduce the deficit. In reality, the Republicans have an absolutely incoherent platform that will place an enormous burden on the poor, unemployed, and middle class, increase the deficit, and fail to create jobs or growth. It’s a pledge to the top one percent, a document that helps the extremely wealthy at the expense of the least fortunate.
The Republicans have a lot of old, tried, and discarded ideas in their plan. One of them is to extend the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, which will have little positive economic impact at an enormous cost to the deficit. It’s confounding that the Republicans are viewed as a party of fiscal sense when they aim to pass a deficit-busting tax cut extension that will carve an enormous hole in our budget.
Another hallmark Republican idea is to repeal the healthcare reform law, which was the first major legislation to combat inequality in decades and finally will ensure that healthcare is a right, not a privilege. The law is far from perfect, but it is already one of the largest deficit-reduction packages in years, reducing the deficit by $118 billion over ten years, while allowing the poor and middle class to live secure and healthy lives. If Republicans really cared about fiscal sustainability and the welfare of those without health care, they would aim to make this law better by implementing more cost controls and improvements. Instead, the goal of repeal betrays their true motives of lower taxes on high-income individuals, regardless of the cost to society as a whole.
The Republicans have claimed that they will implement drastic spending reductions, but that senior citizens, veterans, and defense spending will be exempt from any of these cuts. Medicare and defense spending are where a vast amount of savings can be found, and exempting these politically uncomfortable areas leaves discretionary spending, which is much easier to cut in theory than in practice. Especially in today’s economy, where poverty is at a 15-year high, Americans desperately need services such as Medicaid, food stamps, and aid to poor families and children, which will be the first things to go in “discretionary” cuts. This is not to mention essentials such as infrastructure and education spending—investments in our country’s future that will certainly not be made under a Republican Congress devoted to cutting discretionary spending.
The Democrats, on the other hand, have made America a far more just society with a bright future over the last two years through smart and fair policy. The stimulus plan, while not large enough, put millions of Americans back to work, helping poor and middle class Americans find jobs during tough times. In addition to universal healthcare, the Democrats have also passed a financial regulation law that makes markets far safer for everyday consumers and the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which should help level the playing field for women in the workforce. They have taken steps to unlock our struggling schools from stasis through education reform, helping the poorest students and have ensured that workers out of jobs still have access to the social safety net. Their efforts to pass more job creation measures have been filibustered by Republicans, but they have implemented countless policies that are creating a more fair and dynamic society.
The two parties offer a clear choice in the November elections. The Republicans offer giveaways to the wealthy and seem to have little else guiding their motives. The Democrats have moved America forward through policies that strengthen the weakest Americans, giving them health care and protecting them from the excesses of the financial system and the swings of the economy. Democrats have built a society with a more productive and just future; the Republicans hope to tear it down for a few wealthy citizens.

Omar A. Khadr, a Canadian citizen, was 15 years old at the time of his capture and arrest, after a firefight in Afghanistan, in 2002. He is accused of throwing a grenade that killed Army Sergeant Christopher Speer even though Khadr, at the time, was blinded in his left eye and shot twice in the back. It is not clear that he actually did this, yet he has spent eight years in the Guantanamo Bay prison without trial. His father, an Al Qaeda associate who is now dead, brought him to the battlefield. He is now 24, without hope of justice. Many in Canada regard him as a child solider, with the Canadian government refusing to request the repatriation of Khadr.
The question that remains is why is the Obama administration putting a child soldier on trial? Perhaps it is because the Canadian government has shown little to no interest in getting Khadr back. His father after all, was a part of Osama bin Laden’s inner circle of confidants when Khadr was 10. The idea that we are comfortable with punishing the son for the sins of the father is alarming.
Khadr is the youngest of the 176 detainees and is the only Westerner currently being held at the facility. All other nations have successfully repatriated their detainees. The United Nations and Amnesty International have expressed grave concern over Khadr’s case and the trial
The Supreme Court of Canada unanimously declared that Khadr’s human rights had been violated but opted not to suggest a remedy such as bringing Khadr back to Canada. Canadian intelligence officials also interrogated Khadr without legal counsel after systemic sleep deprivation.
Since his trial began, the proceedings have already had their share of complexities. In July, having lost faith in the legal process, Khadr fired his legal team and boycotted his own trial. He then turned down a plea bargain of 30 years in lieu of life. And on 2010 Aug. 12, his lawyer, who had gotten a gall bladder surgery six weeks before the trial, collapsed near the end of the first day of proceedings. As such, the trial has been postponed until Oct. 18.
Khadr has been in American custody for nine years. He says that when he did not say what the guards wanted to hear, he was tortured and threatened with gang rape by “four big black guys.” Furthermore, Khadr’s chief interrogator testified to doing this in order to scare Khadr into confessing. All the while he was merely 15 years old with severe wounds. He suffered from bullet holes in his chest and his eyes were full of shrapnel. Yet despite this, the judge at his tribunal said that the statements he made in those circumstances are “perfectly admissible.” It appears the case is based largely on confessions he made under duress.
Interestingly, Khadr’s case—“a proceeding condemned by legal and humanitarian groups around the world”—will be the first full military commission under Barack Obama, even though he had promised to shut down Guantanamo within his first year of office.
Daphne Eviatar, a decorated human-rights lawyer, goes so far as to argue that the acts committed by the U.S. government are war crimes themselves. David Glazier, a professor of law, says that the crimes Khadr is charged with fall under the new Military Commission Acts, which in themselves and with the USA PATRIOT Act, are an affront to the U.S. Constitution. Furthermore, the U.S. federal government then went forth to unilaterally change international law, allowing them to redefine conspiracy and aiding in a crime. Because the laws were not actually in place when Khadr supposedly committed the crimes, such a trial is also a violation of the prohibition on ex post facto laws.
Such a mockery of America’s justice system bodes poorly for the Obama administration, which relished a clean slate. The majority of cases that ever see a civilian criminal court have been dismissed, showing the complete lack of any real evidence.
Even more disturbing is the fact that the charges Khadr is facing are not actually war crimes under the Geneva Conventions. For the sake of argument, let us just assume Khadr is guilty of the charges brought against him. Even if this were true, since when has killing the enemy on the battlefront become a war crime?

With the midway point of the season having come and gone, the Harvard sailing team began the second half of the campaign on a less hectic note than usual. Competing in only two regattas this weekend compared to the usual four or five, the Crimson couldn’t underestimate the importance of these two events to kick off the remainder of the season.
The highlights of the weekend for Harvard were provided by the co-ed contingent sent to New Hampshire for the Captain Hurst Bowl Regatta hosted by Dartmouth, as the Crimson captured a first-place team finish for the first time in three weeks.
“It was good to have a good regatta in the breeze,” senior skipper John Stokes said. “All of us sailed really well in the breeze. We’re going to use this as a building block and a confidence builder for the Hoyt Trophy [at Brown] next weekend and the qualifiers the week after that.”
Harvard also had an all-freshman female delegation compete at the Yale Women’s Regatta held in New Haven, Conn., where the Crimson placed 17 out of a field of 18. While the outcome was not ideal, it was important to the team that the rookies gained valuable time and experience on the water.
CAPTAIN HURST BOWL
Harvard’s top co-ed sailors traveled up to Hanover, N.H., to compete in the Captain Hurst Bowl regatta, where the Crimson took home first-place honors behind the strength of a first-place A division win and a third-place B division finish. The team would sail to victory by a margin of 17 points, earning its first team victory since the end of Sept.
After being recognized as the Sailor of the Week by U.S. Sailing just a week prior, senior skipper Alan Palmer was instrumental in the team’s capture of top honors in the A division.
The senior duo of Palmer and crew Quincy Bock, along with sophomore crew Ryan Byrne, took care of business in their division, finishing in the top five positions in 11 out of the 14 races, including seven top-three finishes. They finished 13 points ahead of the second-place sailors from the Big Green.
At the 20-team intersectional, Harvard also sent out Stokes alongside fellow fourth-year crew Meghan Wareham and freshman crew Luke O’Connor to compete in the B division. The trio started each day of sailing slow but quickly built up momentum with four top-two finishes, ending the regatta in third place.
“It was a really close regatta for most of the weekend,” Stokes said. “We largely pulled it out because of the performance from our heavies Alan [Palmer], Ryan [Byrne], and the performance from our A team. There’s room for improvement but we’re really happy with how we performed.”
YALE WOMEN’S INTERSECTIONAL
Harvard sent a squad of four freshmen to compete at the Women’s Intersectional regatta over the weekend held at Yale, where the women sailed to a disappointing 17th place finish out of 18 teams. But the team continued this season’s trend of giving the rookies a chance to race and gain some experience, which the veterans on the squad hope will prove very valuable to the team in the future.
“We’re pleased with the performance of all of our freshman,” junior captain Emily Lambert said. “Unfortunately for our girls, the regatta was just too windy, and they weren’t able to perform as well as we know they can. But it’s a good learning experience for them, and they’ll be able to grow from it.”
Skipper Morgan Russom and crew Isabel Ruane sailed in the A division, where they placed 17th out of the field of 18, but the two gradually performed better as the event proceeded, notching a pair of top-ten finishes in the last four races.
Classmates Caitlin Watson and Louisa French took care of the skippering and crewing duties in the B division, respectively. Unable to complete the first two races of the regatta, the two were nevertheless able to squeak out of a last-place finish with a narrow one-point edge over Boston University.

In the wake of their successful collegiate squash careers, former Crimson athletes Gregory Lee ’87 and Russell Ball ’88 have recently announced Harvard’s 11th endowed coaching position.
“Russ and I had a great experience at Harvard playing squash,” Lee said. “We made some of our best friends at college from participating in squash, and so we really wanted the program to have the support and also the leader that we had had when we were at Harvard.”
Lee and Ball also made some serious plays for the Crimson record books.
During their four years playing for Harvard, Lee and Ball helped their teams take home four national championship titles. Ball, a three-time All-American and four-time first-team All-Ivy League selection, also captained his squad as a senior.
The pair credited much of its success, however, to the passion and dedication of then-squash coach Dave Fish ’72.
“He really is like an institution,” said Lee of Fish’s coaching legacy. “He understands the standpoint of hitting the ball as well as the psychological side.”
This nuanced understanding came, at least in part, from Fish’s own experience as captain of both the tennis and squash teams—he led the squads to three national squash championships and one Ivy League tennis championship.
Afterward, in his 13 years as the men’s squash coach, Fish led the Crimson to seven national titles, including a six-year winning streak.
But Fish was forced to redirect his efforts as Harvard tennis gained momentum and expanded its schedule.
“Fish became solely the [men’s] tennis coach because tennis became more of a two-season sport,” Lee explained. “It was too hard to coach squash at same time.”
Now, fast forward two decades to the summer of 2010 in which the Crimson was in desperate need of a new Director of Squash.
An advisory board comprised of the Nichols Family Director of Athletics Bob Scalise and a group of alumni including Lee and Ball conducted a search that spanned across North America and, according to Lee, possibly “around the world.”
But financial concerns grew as the board crunched numbers and considered the salaries of many of the top candidates.
“To really put the squash program in the shape where it could hire among the best candidates and then provide a job where they could be there for a long time,” said Lee, ”The squash program needed some financial support.”
And so the idea of the endowment was born.
Enter Canadian Michael Way, coach and mentor to dozens of world and national champions, All-Americans, and junior national champions. In an interesting turn to his career, Way is now coach and mentor to the men and women of Harvard squash. And he is just as excited about the distinguished alumni’s idea as the rest of the Crimson squash world.
“[The endowment] gives squash a new level of importance at Harvard, a new level of prestige,” Way said. “I’m just extremely proud to be a part of this, especially as so few [coaching] positions have been endowed. It is just tremendous.”
During his illustrious career, Way coached fellow Canadian Jonathon Power to a world championship title and also seven Canadian championship victories.
But that’s just the tip of the iceberg.
Way has also worked with Australian world champion Sarah Fitz-Gerald and Canadian national champions Graham Ryding, Shahier Razik, and Marine Baizley­­—the athletes won three, four, and two titles, respectively.  He also worked with many younger squash prodigies in the Canadian National Squash Training Centre.
One of these decorated young athletes is none other than Harvard’s own Laura Gemmell, the sophomore phenom who took home the CSA individual national title in her rookie season. The pair worked together in the U13 circuit, and Gemmell is eager to work with Way again.
“We’re really lucky to have him,” Gemmell enthused. “I think he’s going to do a lot of good things for the program.”
Despite Way’s lack of experience at the collegiate level, Gemmell is confident in her coach’s abilities.
“He’s working on improving everyone’s game and making sure we remain a dominant team,” Gemmell said. “He’s running recruiting and he’s already getting a lot of good girls for next year to make our team even stronger.”
“I can’t speak for the guy’s team,” she continued, “But Mike is completely new energy for them and they’re pumped up and really ready to play well this year.”
The squash program’s most recent addition is eager to help the women’s team defend its national title and also lead the men’s team to a shot at its 32nd national championship victory.
“We’ve got two squads that have great attitudes and very strong work ethic,” Way said. “That’s as much as any coach could ask for.”
And with all of Way’s likenesses to Fish, Lee is confident that the first-ever Gregory Lee ’87 and Russell Ball ’88 Endowed Coach for Squash can help the program accomplish its goals.
“The thought that he’s put into [squash]­—all the technical ways of hitting the ball, the ways of playing the game—reminds me so much of Dave Fish who knew the game just like that,” Lee said. “After only a few minutes with [Way], almost anyone who loves squash can see that he has a tremendous gift.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Save the best for last, they say.
The stage was set up so that many would not fare so well. With temperatures teetering between the 30’s and 40s and wind speeds matching those numbers, the conditions were far from ideal to compete at the Northeast Invitational, hosted by the University of Rhode Island this past weekend. But, since it was the final event of the season, junior captain Tony Grillo made no excuses and had his best outing yet.
“His performance this week was really cool to see because he had been struggling earlier in the season,” freshman Seiji Liu said. “I’m really proud of him for just coming through and playing well. Hitting some great shots in these tough conditions was really great for him.”
In the final competition of the short fall season for men’s golf, the Crimson had its highest first-round score of the year with 300, but it was Grillo’s play that helped keep Harvard in contention. On Saturday, the junior came out strong and posted 16 pars, 1 birdie, and 1 bogey to finish even par at 71.
This performance was followed up the next day with a round of 73—a score that could have been lower had it not been for Grillo’s triple bogey in the 10th hole that nixed his chances of winning the tournament.
“I was playing as well as I was playing [Saturday], but I had a really bad 10th hole and that set me back quite a bit unfortunately,” Grillo said. “Either way I was able to hold it together and gained another stroke coming in, so I was very happy with that.”
Sunday’s score of 73 was matched by teammate Liu, and both results contributed to a better second-round score of 297, which was good enough to help the Crimson place second overall with 597 points, nine behind winner Columbia.
Going two over par the entire weekend was by far the best performance for Grillo and one of the best for the team this season. He finished tied for third place individually, improving from the 42nd-place finish he achieved last week at the Big 5 Invitational.
“I think it all just kind of came together,” Grillo said. “I went back and worked on my swing a couple of weeks ago. This week I planned on being able to stop thinking about it so much.”
“Like I said, I think the weather helped me to do that,” he added. “I was more worried about my shots than about what my swing was doing.”
As a result, Grillo produced a consistent performance that propelled Harvard to its highest finish this season in a tournament that had at least 14 competitors.
For much of the fall campaign, the seasoned veteran placed among the top three performers on the team, among talented rookies Liu and Theodore Lederhausen and junior Mark Pollak, but never leading the pack.
Before this weekend’s event, Grillo’s top performance came two weeks ago at the MacDonald Cup hosted by Ivy League rival Yale. Grillo posted two rounds of 71 and 75, going six over par and coming in sixth place individually and second on the team.
In the competition previous to that, the Crimson participated in a 54-hole tournament in which the team had its best finish in its history, placing seventh out of 15 teams. Grillo had a significant contribution to that result as well, finishing only four over par, with his second round going two below par–the best round for Harvard all season.
The junior’s strong play this semester has built off a successful season last year when he was named to the Ping Division I All-New England Team. In Ivy League championship play, Grillo came in sixth place, enough to earn him a spot on the 2010 All-Ivy League second team.
His credentials merited him the title of captain this season, and his teammates have appreciated the junior’s guidance and experience in and out of the classroom thus far.
“I think Tony is doing a fantastic job as captain,” Liu said. “His leadership has been really great, especially in helping me transition to the college athletic life…He’s just been a really good mentor to me [in regards to] countless things.”

A team of computer scientists and education researchers at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences has been awarded a three-year, $2.3 million grant from the National Science Foundation to develop interactive educational software on the topic of evolution.
The grant will fund the creation of a digital museum exhibit that utilizes touch-screen technology to allow users to explore a “Tree of Life,” which will visually catalogue nearly all of the known plant and animal species on earth.
The exhibit will also include collaborative games that allow users to informally learn about topics like natural selection and competition among species.
Once the software for the exhibits has been completed, it will be displayed in at least five museums across the country—including the California Academy of Sciences and the Boston Children's Museum—providing the new technology with a potential user base of 4.5 million or more visitors every year.
The initiative brings together a “variety of people” in fields as diverse as computer science, evolutionary biology, and cognitive developmental psychology and learning sciences, according to Chia Shen, the director of the Scientists’ Discovery Room Lab at SEAS, which will be spearheading the project.
“This is a highly interdisciplinary, highly collaborative proposal,” Shen said.
She added that the project’s unique focus on how to educate the public using cutting-edge technology may have made the project an attractive candidate for the NSF grant, which was awarded by the Division of Research on Learning in Formal and Informal Settings.
“Part of the focus from the NSF perspective is really enhancing informal science education,” Shen said. “It’s very hard for the public to understand evolution without some type of interaction and visualization that makes it more intuitive.”
Shen noted that the grant was awarded in an extremely competitive application process. She said that the NSF received roughly 600 preliminary proposals for the grant money last year, but that only 40 projects were ultimately funded.
Shen said that the greatest challenge for the project lies in the complexities of designing the exhibit itself.
“We are writing the algorithms to visualize 1.8 million species on the tabletop,” Shen said. “Obviously you cannot visualize 1.8 million dots, so we need an intelligent way to allow you as a user to focus on a region of interest.”
She also highlighted the challenges of designing a “multiuser adaptive interface” which will allow users to join and leave an interactive game as they come and go.

Foreign Minister of Pakistan Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi discussed the ways to improve the sometimes-tense partnership between his country and the United States during a packed Institute of Politics forum last night.
Qureshi, who spent the earlier part of the day touring Harvard and visiting classes, told the audience that he hoped to “bridge [the] trust deficit” that currently hinders relations between Pakistan and the United States by working toward a deeper understanding—and a greater sense of compassion—between the two countries.
“I think we have taken some steps forward, but we have a long way to go,” Qureshi said, adding that the United States could improve relations with his country by approving a free trade treaty and appropriating more aid for the millions of Pakistanis affected by recent flooding in the nation.
Qureshi will be in Washington D.C. today to lead the Pakistani delegation in the third round of talks with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about the two nation’s relationship and future.
During his IOP appearance, Qureshi highlighted several of his nation’s recent achievements, including forming a democratically elected government, criminalizing violence against women, and developing a free press.
He addressed Pakistan’s relationship with India and Afghanistan, advocating diplomacy and dialogue to resolve regional disputes. In discussing Pakistan’s relationship with its neighbors, he also affirmed Pakistan’s commitment to fighting the Taliban within his nation’s own borders, noting that both the United States and Pakistan have suffered due to the “terrorist cancer.”
But Qureshi also spoke about the tensions that continue to make Pakistanis distrustful of the American government. He cited a recent Pew Research Center poll, which indicated that 60 percent of Pakistanis view the United States as an enemy.
“There is a reason why our people believe what they believe,” Qureshi said, adding that many Pakistanis distrust the United States because the American government has supported Pakistani military dictators in the past and caused instability by pulling out of the region following the Cold War.
Can Soylu ’14, who attended the event,  said that he was impressed by Qureshi’s willingness to openly voice his opinion that the United States has not always been a good ally to Pakistan.
Omer Aftab ’11, a native of Pakistan, said that he found Qureshi courageous, in that he “didn’t shy away from any questions” posed by the audience. Aftab also applauded the foreign minister for his willingness to present the Pakistani case to an American audience, and his directness in addressing Pakistan’s relationship with neighboring countries.

Robbers stole $30,000 worth of iPhones, along with more than $1,800 in cash, from the RadioShack on 28 JFK St. late Sunday night, according to a report filed by the Cambridge Police Department.
The report stated that the robbery occurred as the store’s assistant manager on duty was in the process of closing up for the night. According to his account, the assistant manager was kneeling to set the alarm on the storefront door when he was grabbed from behind by several unidentified male figures.
He was then forced into the back room and held to the floor while the suspects proceeded to carry out the robbery, stealing the keys to the store and the contents of the cash register along with a large number of iPhones and $1,600 which was to be deposited from the RadioShack’s sales that day.
The suspects were able to make a clean escape before the Cambridge police arrived.
According to the police report, the assistant manager was unable to see the faces of any of the robbers and could not identify any of them.
But in his statement to officers, he said that he believed that at least one of the robbers had to have prior knowledge of the equipment in the store, as the group was able to unlock the cash register, which requires a specific sequence of buttons and levers to open.
Individuals arriving at the scene were advised not to touch the cash register to preserve any fingerprints that may help to identify the suspects.
The police report also noted that the robbery occurred at 10:58 p.m., much later than the store’s typical Sunday closing time of 7:30 p.m. The assistant manager said he was forced to keep the store open late due to the presence of a lingering customer.
Despite the significant loss in merchandise, RadioShack carried on business as usual on Monday. When asked about the previous night’s events, employees declined to comment.

University President Drew G. Faust joined the crowds that flocked to see “The Social Network,” and she said she emerged from the theater thoroughly entertained—though a bit skeptical of the film’s depiction of Harvard.
Faust said she was particularly tickled by a scene that takes place in a fictionalized version of her office in which two characters—the Winklevoss twins—meet with then-University President Lawrence H. Summers to air their complaints against Facebook founder and former Harvard student Mark E. Zuckerberg.
“One of the things that amused me most was the portrayal of Mass. Hall—where are my ancient books?” Faust asked, gesturing around her office, which contains more international tchotchkes than the sorts of old volumes shown in the movie.
As a fan of the “The West Wing,” Faust said she appreciated screenwriter Aaron Sorkin’s snappy dialogue for the movie. But she said that she was troubled by the lack of strong female characters.
“I was very concerned about the portrayal of women,” Faust said. “All the people who had agency in this movie who were important were all men...There are the spurned girlfriends, there are the people at parties, but women don’t seem to be full participants in Harvard student life.”
That depiction, Faust said, does not line up with the Harvard she knows.
According to Faust, Sorkin failed to deliver the powerful women that consistently confronted—and often deflated—the large male egos of the Bartlet administration in his long-running television series.
“I think Aaron Sorkin wrote such great female characters in ‘The West Wing,’” she said. “C.J. and Donna were fabulous, but there’s no similar representation of terrific female characters in ‘The Social Network.’”
Faust also said that she thought the film played excessively on stereotypes of the Harvard experience.
“People just have ideas of what student life is like,” Faust said. “They have in their head certain images that are associated with Ivy League institutions, or what youth do in Ivy League institutions, or what athletes are like.”
And who was Faust’s favorite character?
“I thought one of the most interesting and complex characters was Sean Parker,” she said, referring to the Napster co-founder played by Justin Timberlake. “He was seductive and yet so complicated. He was sort of Mephistophelean. There was something both attractive and repulsive about him.”
“The Social Network,” which opened on Oct. 1, documents the creation of the social networking site Facebook and has been received with general critical acclaim. Many of the scenes in the movie take place at a fictionalized Harvard, where Zuckerberg founded the site.

In a vote of 26-7-4, the Undergraduate Council said it “fully condemns” the University’s decision to accept donations in honor of former professor Martin “Marty” H. Peretz, who has attracted criticism following a Sept. blog post in which he described Muslim life as “cheap, especially for Muslims.”
In the aftermath of the post, student groups such as the Harvard Islamic Society, Black Students Association, and Latinas Unidas have denounced Harvard’s decision to accept a $650,000 fund for undergraduate Social Studies research named for Peretz.
In its resolution, the UC said that Peretz has a history of making “bigoted statements against Muslims, Arabs, Latinos and African Americans.”
The Council decried the University’s decision to accept gifts in Peretz’s honor, calling on the administration to convene a “commission” to consider removing Peretz’s name from the fund.
The UC decided to add its voice to the debate after several student groups that have been active in the protest against the Peretz Fund approached the Council.
“This issue [is] going to fade out in January,” said Student Life Committee Chair Senan Ebrahim ’12, one of the sponsors of the legislation. “There’s a time to talk and a time to act, and I really think the time to act is now.”
While the Council passed the motion after a heated discussion, some members expressed reservations, including hesitation about whether the UC should register an opinion on the matter in its role as a representative of the entire student body.
“I think that the UC didn’t have a very good understanding of the grant and how the grant was structured,” said Adams House representative Ellen V. Lehman ’11, who voted against the motion. “I think it’s unrealistic to have the name removed from the fund, and I think it’s important for Social Studies students to get the money they deserve.”
During the meeting, the UC also approved the creation of the Hack Harvard Campus App Incubator program. This program will give the creators of five promising computer applications—most likely those created as final projects in Computer Science 50—seed money and mentorship to further develop their projects.
“[CS50 is] one of the few areas anywhere in an undergrad course where your assignment is basically, ‘Do something cool,’” UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11 said. “A lot of [the projects] would be really useful for the whole campus...We just need to actually give these groups a couple more resources.”

Two recent studies with ties to Harvard Medical School have discovered new genetic variations that predispose people to obesity and affect general fat distribution within the human body.
The studies examined 32 genetic obesity susceptibility loci, 18 of which were new to the researchers.
Joel N. Hirschhorn ’86, associate professor at the Medical School and senior associate member and coordinator of the Metabolism Initiative at the Broad Institute, and Elizabeth K. Speliotes, an instructor in medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Broad Institute, worked with hundreds of other researchers as part of the Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium beginning in 2007 to isolate specific genetic arrangements that might predict a person’s likeliness to be obese.
The researchers investigated the possibility that these genetic variations might determine a person’s Body Mass Index, a measurement of body density that scientists and researchers use to gauge obesity.
The study on Body Mass Index was conducted on a sample size of over 249,796 individuals, while the second one on fat retention was conducted on 190,803 people.
The benefit of working in a consortium was that the researchers were able to accumulate a significant body of knowledge on a topic they believed may prove valuable but had little supporting data, according to Speliotes.
In their study of fat distribution throughout the body, the researchers used the waist-to-hip ratio of men and women to examine the gender differences in bodily adiposity and the metabolic effect of different types of fat.
“Fat is not homogeneous throughout the body,” said Lee M. Kaplan ’75, associate professor of medicine and director of the MGH Obesity Research Center. “Fat around the abdomen is associated with metabolic disorders such as heart diseases while subcutaneous fat just under the skin sometimes has a protective function.”
Speliotes said that the studies have important policy implications.
“Through work like this, it opens up a lot of areas into possible research that could better classify types of obesity and could offer better care for obesity in the future,” she said.
Speliotes added that there are similar health care implications for the second study about fat retention throughout the body, which she said might lead to more adequate and patient-specific care options—such as individually tailored diet plans and the development of new drugs—that might help combat the U.S. obesity epidemic in the future.

Known fondly as “the Green Sheikh,” Sheikh Abdul Aziz bin Ali Al Nuaimi of the United Arab Emirates discussed environmental sustainability in the UAE in a presentation hosted by the Center for Middle Eastern Studies.
Aziz is the chairman of the International Steering Committee for the Global Initiative Towards a Sustainable Iraq. He is a member of the ruling family of the Emirate of Ajman, and environmental adviser to the Government of Ajman.
The Green Sheikh is known for his cultural understanding and message of “holistic living” for the world. He champions the use of Middle Eastern cultural traditions to help preserve the environment.
“The best sustainable transport is the camel,” he said. “It carries you, then dies and passes through the earth and renews the soil.”
Later, in response to a question about the value of dates, Aziz said that they are “fruits of heaven” and that people can survive for a lifetime on dates and water.
Moving beyond the Middle East and the environment to cultural intelligence among different peoples, Aziz contended that by recognizing their similarities people can appreciate individuality.
Besides the United States, Aziz has travelled to Iceland and Japan, among many other nations.
“We need the West, we need the East,” he said. “That’s why we call it ‘we.’”
With support from the Quran, Aziz asserted that people were created in order to help, not hurt, one another.
“O mankind! We created you from a single man and woman and made you into nations and tribes that you may know each other, not that you may despise each other,” Aziz quoted.
Anthony C. Donofrio, a New York attorney and friend of Aziz, sat in on the discussion and recounted the sheikh’s first visit to New York City, where Aziz experienced a Broadway play and a Yankees game.
Donofrio later mentioned his own visit to Dubai. Aziz bought his friend traditional Muslim garb and took him to a traditional Muslim wedding ceremony, a wake, and a Muslim burial ceremony to help him better understand Muslim culture.
When asked how his life might affect society as a whole, Aziz said, “I want to impact people not by saying, but by living.”

Updated Oct. 20, 2010
Brooklyn-based bus service World Wide Tours will launch on Oct. 27 a new bus line called World Wide Bus, which will travel between Cambridge and New York City.
Regular one-way fares will cost $15 on weekdays and $20 on weekends. World Wide Bus is offering an introductory price of $10 for one-way trips any day of the week in a sale that ends Nov. 18.
Passengers will be picked up at the Alewife MBTA Station in Cambridge and then at Riverside Station in Newton. They will be dropped off in Manhattan at 31st St. and 8th Ave., near Penn Station.
The new line, which features free wireless internet access, will leave four times a day during the week and eight times a day on weekends.
When asked about the new competition, Timothy Stokes, company spokesperson for BoltBus, said that he cannot speculate on World Wide Bus' effect on BoltBus' short- and long-term sales, adding that he welcomes competition.
"We...see it is as proof that intercity transportation is growing," Stokes said. "Competition brings an advantage to the industry as well as the public, by continuing to provide affordable transportation services with popular amenities customers seem to enjoy."
Lucky Star Bus and representatives from several other bus services declined to comment.
Harvard students are cautiously enthusiastic about the creation of a new direct route.
“That’s awesome, as long as it’s not ridiculously crowded,” said Thomas C. Foley, Jr. ’13, who said he rides Amtrak trains to the Big Apple.
Benjamin K. Moss ’13 said that he would only ride the World Wide Bus if it proves better than the BoltBus. “I’d only use it if it had the same amenities, like WiFi,” he said.

Amidst a recent surge in reports of suicides by gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered youth suffering from harassment, gay author and activist Marc Adams spoke at the Harvard Graduate School of Education yesterday about the challenges facing queer youth in religious schools.
Over the course of the discussion, Adams, an award-winning author of nine LGBT-themed books, shared his experiences of being raised in a fundamentalist Baptist home and educated in various religious institutions.
Adams became aware of his attraction to his male friends at the age of seven, and soon entertained suicidal thoughts: “I felt like I had two options—either end my life, or change my life and become ‘ex-gay,’” he said.
At 19, Adams finally started his journey towards self-acceptance. “I never felt like a whole person,” he said. “I realized that what I needed to do was learn how to accept myself not only as a gay person, but as a human being.”
He dropped out of Liberty University, a private Christian university, and founded HeartStrong, Inc., a nonprofit, nonsectarian organization to provide outreach to LGBT individuals adversely affected by the anti-gay environment at religious educational institutions.
“There’s a clock ticking on the emotional life of students in these schools. Our work is a rescue mission, and it is more relevant today than when we started 15 years ago,” he said. “All they look for is hope, and we give them hope.”
Adams concluded his speech by calling on the media to pay more attention to the situation facing LGBT youth in public institutions of education, as well.
“We need people to assume leadership in this country to move things in the right direction,” he said.
GSE student Quyen T. Truong, who attended the event, said that Harvard ought to do more to support its gay community.
“There should be more representation of queer students and students of color at Harvard’s various graduate schools,” she said.
James F.L. Croft, chair of QueerEd, the LGBT student group at GSE that organized yesterday’s event, echoed Truong’s call for increased effort by the University to create a more accepting environment for LGBT individuals.
“Just because we’re in the ‘People’s Republic of Cambridge’ doesn’t mean that there isn’t some fear and discrimination toward LGBT individuals,” he said.
Adams’ talk was followed by a planning meeting to create a Harvard entry to the “It Gets Better” campaign, a project started by relationship and sex advice columnist Dan Savage to send messages of hope via YouTube videos to young LGBT people around the world.

The Cambridge City Council voted at a meeting yesterday to increase the residential parking sticker fee for 2011 from $8 to $20 per permit, and to further raise the fee by $5 in 2013.
The additional revenue will be used to fund the expansion of the City’s transportation and environmental programs, according to a letter addressed to the Council from City Manager Robert W. Healy. But he did not specify the exact nature of the “programs,” causing some councillors to express concerns about the ultimate destination of the money.
“We owe the people [of Cambridge] an explanation of where this [money] is going to be spent on,” said Timothy J. Toomey, Jr. the only councillor who voted against the proposal.
He said that the fee increase is “arbitrary” and “unfair” to Cambridge citizens who might not be “financially comfortable” with the change.
Although Councillor Marjorie C. Decker voted for the proposal, she conceded that “the Council should have spent more time on what the money should be used for.”
The permit increases for 2011 and 2013 passed by an eight to one vote at the Council meeting.
The first change will be effective this coming January, and seniors—who do not have to pay parking fees under current regulations—are exempt from both increases.
“I have never been a fan of increasing fees, but I do see the worthiness of this [increase],” said Cambridge Mayor David P. Maher, adding that he is “pleased” that senior citizens will continue to be exempt from the tax increase.
Echoing the mayor, Councillor Sam Seidel said that the “moderate” increase “is not an undue burden for the vast majority of the citizens.”
In support of the decision, Cambridge citizen Minka VanBeuzekom said that the increase in the permit fee could lead to a decrease in residential parking and an increase in pedestrian and bike traffic. “I urge the Council to pass this increase tonight,” she said.
The Council last increased the parking fee in 1992, when it doubled the $4 parking fee that had been in effect since the mid-1970s.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two characters are rehearsing a scene on stage. To the audience, as well as the show’s staff, their conversation is inaudible. After a few moments of apparent silence, an actor interrupts, urging the pair to “project!” To this, one objects: “I can’t. These are the kinds of things you can’t say out loud.”
The director of the show then steps in. “Well that’s very poetic and all, but you’re going to have to project anyway. We can’t hear you at all and we’re up here onstage. How is an audience out in the house going to know what’s going on?”
The tradeoff between realism and the requirements of performance, explored here in a play within a play, is a major theme in nineteenth-century playwright Luigi Pirandello’s meta-theatrical “Six Characters in Search of an Author.” Theater, like all other art, relies on illusion—the credibility of clearly fictional scenes. It is unadulterated praise for theater to be labeled ‘realistic’ or ‘honest.’ Yet theater is also deeply conventional, relying on methods that are consummately unrealistic in order to simulate reality.
“You can’t just whisper on stage,” says English Professor Martin Puchner. In April he released a book entitled “The Drama of Ideas: Platonic Provocations in Theater and Philosophy,” a discussion of philosophical playwrights like Pirandello. To the audience, he says, a whisper would be inaudible: “You have to use a stage whisper.”
Such conventions, which work artificially to make theatrical action immediate and comprehensible to the typical audience, are firmly entrenched in the customs of theatrical production. But two productions happening in Cambridge in the next few weeks directly challenge these conventions through the theatrical medium itself. A Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club (HRDC) production of “6 Characters”—billed as “6” instead of “Six,” and incorporating a Harvard College setting—will run in the Loeb Drama Center Experimental Theater from October 21 to 23. In November, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) will host a production of 30 plays from “Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind,” a show created by a group of Chicago dramatists known as the Neo-Futurists to bring more direct reality to the stage.
According to Puchner, philosophical concepts have historically been viewed as antithetical to the action of dramatic art—but both of these productions manage to address the issues surrounding artistic representation while avoiding tedious pedagogy. By adding layers of illusion into its plot, “Six Characters” uses meta-theater to explore the philosophical dialectic between performance and reality. The Neo-Futurists take a drastically different approach, destructing the proverbial fourth wall between actor and audience in order to create what they believe is a more honest form of theater. Through unconventional yet different understandings of the balance between illusion and authenticity, Pirandello and the Neo-Futurists seek to test the limits of drama’s capabilities and redefine theater’s relationship with reality.
MOMENTS OF CROSSING
In “The Drama of Ideas,” Puchner argues that philosophy and theater have a conflicted history of mutual attraction and repulsion. Their first intersections occurred in Plato’s dialogues, with fictional discussions of philosophical matters. “He invented characters and placed them in settings and scenes,” Puchner says. “They exchange dialogue but its not just dry abstract philosophy. There’s a lot of human interaction in the course of these dialogues: characters get embarrassed, they tease each other.”
After a period of independence, the two forms merged again around 1900 in the dramas of George Bernard Shaw, and the works of existentialist playwrights like Samuel Beckett and Jean-Paul Sartre, and Pirandello himself. The resurgence has continued unabated, and even, in the case of Tom Stoppard, developed a major following. Still, Puchner adds, “I don’t think that all of a sudden there will be tons of Broadway shows that are philosophical dramas.” The HRDC, itself has produced numerous productions of plays by August Strindberg, Bertolt Brecht, and Sartre in recent years.
Despite this renaissance, Puchner identifies a conflicted relationship between philosophy and theater. “Both have often dissociated themselves, but then again and again there are moments of crossing,” he says.
Their frequent divergence demonstrates some mutual distrust. This tension stems in part from the apparent incompatibility of theatrical action and philosophical cogitation According to Puchner, “when you start to study theater, often the first thing you’re told is that ‘drama’ in Greek means ‘action.’ So drama should be based on action, not ideas, and if you introduce too many ideas you ruin it.” Jesse T. Nee-Vogelman, Director of the HRDC’s “6 Characters,” appears to agree. “A lot of people don’t have tolerance for that kind of thing... they want something that’s very straightforward and relaxing to watch. You want to stay away from being preachy,” he says.
Historically, philosophers have also criticized theater. “Philosophers often considered the theater a place of mere appearance, not essence, deceit rather than truth, and so felt that philosophy should actively steer away from it,” Puchner says.
On the other hand, dramatic expression can keep abstract ideas grounded. “Suddenly, philosophy is not only a question of abstract deduction and arguments, but anchors those arguments in some kind of character, in a particular situation, and therefore makes it more concrete,” says Puchner.
The collision of the two disciplines can also inspire light comedy. “One of the earliest anecdotes in the philosophical tradition, attributed to Thales, is that he was walking along, looking at the sky, and he fell into a ditch. This is the origin of the absent-minded philosopher, who has his mind in the clouds,” Puchner says. The Father in “Six Characters,” the philosophical center of the play, also plays into this comic tradition. This does not mean Pirandello thinks these ideas are ludicrous—rather, Puchner says, “both Shaw and Pirandello were masters of the comedy of ideas.”
“THE TRUTH IS WHAT WE SAY IT IS”
Part of the success of “Six Characters” is derived from its comically self-conscious treatment of these esoteric concepts. As the audience takes their seats at a performance of “6 Characters,” a cast is on stage rehearsing another play: “Rules of the Game,” also by Pirandello. “They’re talking about what a terrible play it is and how Pirandello writes this stuff that’s over the audience’s head,” says Jesse T. Nee-Vogelman ’13, Director of the HRDC production. In the midst of the rehearsal, the titular characters enter. Abandoned by their playwright and creator, they demand that their life story be finished and staged. “These characters have a story within them, they’re defined by a story, but they exist in a suspended state until they can perform their story in the theater,” Puchner says. Their interactions with the actors whoplay them are the platform for Pirandello’s meditations on theater itself. His meditations are marked by comical exaggeration of the illusions that complicate that relationship.
“The six characters inhabit several planes of existence,” writes Brandon J. Ortiz ’12, the dramaturge and translator for the production, in an email. “At their lowest level of consciousness, they are the fictional family of their potential play that was never completed by the author. They are also characters that would have been billed in that would-be drama, had it made it to the stage—characters who are now appearing in ‘real life’ during a company’s rehearsal.” And these are just the layers of which the characters are aware.
The great tragedy of the characters, according to Pirandello, is that they cannot break through the final layer of illusion to realize that they serve as amusement for another real audience. At one point, the Lead Actress uses the word ‘illusion’ in passing and elicits signs of discomfort from the six characters. The Father clutches his chest and groans with pain. “It’s just cruel, really cruel to say that word to us,” he says. “Your illusion is the only reality we have.” “They’re not so much acting out the scenes happening to them as living them,” Nee-Vogelman says.
In another seminal moment, the ‘Director’ stops the characters partway through performing a scene and has the actors take their places. The Father quickly objects to his replacement. “He doesn’t look like me, he’s not wearing the right things. This isn’t truth!” The director replies, “Truth? What truth? This is theater, the truth is what we say it is!”
“It’s a really powerful moment of self-questioning,” Ortiz says. “Here are these characters being told by actors that they’re not playing themselves right. It’s a collapse of traditional theater, saying that what we considered to be theater is actually not close to real­—and if you put something real on stage, no one would be able to handle it.” Pirandello’s play thus becomes a meditation on the inadequacies of theatrical representation.
THE SUSPENSION OF BELIEF
“Six Characters” addresses these questions by adding extra layers of illusion to the dramatic experience. To the same end, the Neo-Futurists push in the other direction: they attempt to deconstruct the fourth wall completely. “Neo-Futurism is a new approach to theater which espouses the idea that we are ourselves on stage, where we are, at all times,” says Greg Allen, the movement’s founder.
Allen launched the Neo-Futurists as an experimental ensemble in Chicago in 1988. Their first and most famous show, still running after 21 years, is titled “Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind.” It consists of 30 plays performed in 60 minutes. At the beginning of each show, the audience is given menus with a numbered list of the 30 plays to be performed that evening and asked to shout out the name of the show they wish to see next. “It’s kind of this rollercoaster of different ideas and impulses and all sorts of things being thrust at you in a random order, both for the performers and for the audience,” Allen says. An adaptation of the show will run at MIT’s Kresge Little Theater on November 19 and 20. “The Neo-Futurists have written so many plays (they’ve pretty much been continuously writing this show since the 1980s) that we can do it again without having to repeat anything,” writes producer Lindsay Stone in an email. “Additionally, in the fall we like to do shows that involve a large cast so that we can attract lots of actors and designers who hopefully will stick around for our shows for the rest of the year and years to come,” she adds.
To preserve an element of randomness, the Neo-Futurists vary their selection of short shows greatly from week to week based on audience dice rolls. As a result, the Neo-Futurists have produced over 7,500 plays since their founding. “They run from deconstructions of King Lear, to dance pieces, to simply answering questions the audience asks us honestly, to personal monologues, to puppet adaptations of Othello where Othello is an Oreo cookie,” Allen says.
Neo-Futurist shows intend to eradicate the divide between performer and audience. In one show Allen wrote, entitled “Acme,” he comes on stage with an axe. “I find the biggest, toughest guy in the audience, ...hand them the axe and put my head on the chopping block and badger them to chop off my head,” Allen says. The play requires a great deal of faith in the chosen stranger. “It tests our preconceived notions about who he is and what he would do,” Allen says. “We trust [him] to make the right choice.” And if he doesn’t? “Well, it would be big press,” he says.
OPENNESS AND TRUST
This trust represents the central mission of Neo-Futurism. “We try to influence individuals in the audience to take control of their lives, to live thoughtfully and not be passive viewers to what they see everyday. That’s kind of the bottom line, to get people to interact, to engage, and to act with compassion and responsibility,” he says. Allen believes the Neo-Futurist format accomplishes this humanist goal precisely by making the audience an active participant in the theater. The Neo-Futurists claim the originality of their approach creates a format that in itself is intellectual property.
Recently, Boston’s Independent Drama Society (IDS) was planning their own “Neo-Futurist Project” to show at the Democracy Center on Mount Auburn Street and at Boston Latin School. The production would have included 30 plays of varying subject matter, including one based on the classic video game “Duck Hunt,” and one commenting on the practices of the fast-food industry. Joe Gels, the creator of the “Neo-Futurist Project,” had many of the same goals as Allen. “There’s something very rewarding...about the fact that we can get the same kind of reaction from the audience with our own honest feelings about things that we could by pretending to be someone else,” he says.
However, a dispute with the Chicago Neo-Futurists, who permit others to use their model only in limited educational settings, forced the IDS to cancel their production. According to Allen, “one guy made a huge mistake. He didn’t get the rights to do what he was doing.” Allen claims the Neo-Futurists prescribe imitations so strictly is because they don’t want others to misuse their invention and distort its humanist philosophy. “It’s too scary to release the rights to the format. I’ve always used the Nazis as an example—‘30 fascist plays in 60 minutes.’”
Naturally, the IDS was disappointed by the cancellation. “It was difficult to lose all the hard work that the cast invested in the show,” writes Christine Toohey, Director of Marketing for the IDS. She declined to comment on whether or not the Neo-Futurist format should be protected in the realm of intellectual property.
Allen feels strongly about protecting the honesty and humanism behind Neo-Futurism. He equates the illusion of the fourth wall, a kind of dishonesty associated with traditional theater, with emotional deception he has observed in everyday life. “I felt like [actors on the traditional stage] were lying to me, treating me the same way people in my community were treating me... People had this performative sheen going on to express themselves as happy people, and yet my high school had one of the highest suicide rates in the country. It was a reaction to people not being emotionally honest with each other, and that was destroying lives. And I saw that being reflected in the theatrical conventions of fourth-wall theater.”
USE YOUR ILLUSION
At first, Pirandello and the Neo-Futurists seem diametrically opposed in their approaches to theater. Pirandello builds a “hall of mirrors,” according to Puchner, which is precisely the kind of illusion that the Neo-Futurists seek to shatter. Yet they both recognize the inherent falsehood of illusionistic drama, often pointed out by skeptical philosophers, and push theater to its limits to investigate the possibility of greater honesty.
Pirandello uses meta-theater to draw out drama’s conventionalized lies and “poses the question that theater maybe could be something other than what it is – something closer to life,” says Ortiz. Puchner takes a slightly different stance on Pirandello’s mission. “He admits that the theater is an art, and this means artificial, but he does not want to get rid of this feature,” he writes.
The Neo-Futurists take Pirandello’s investigations one step further. Instead of reflecting on the condition of theater, they tear the veil down entirely, creating a new type of performance that is totally real. “If the whole goal of the art form is human connection, then I’m going to have to be myself,” says Allen. “Anything that would create artifice would then also tarnish that connection between audience and performer. It becomes an aesthetic about wiping away any sense of pretending.”
Both also manage to incorporate a kind of philosophy – “Six Characters” in its content, the Neo-Futurists in their mission – without being entirely derisive of action, which Puchner calls one of the main pitfalls of philosophical theater. Neo-Futurism takes a philosophical approach to justify an entirely action-based form, while Pirandello, Puchner claims, uses meta-theater to “turn the theater itself into an occasion for action”—for example, in the interactions between actors and the six characters.
Thus, not only do Neo-Futurism and Pirandello undermine the idea that theater’s deceitful nature is incompatible with philosophy, they also reject suggestions that philosophy’s pedagogy may have no place in theater—bringing the two together into a harmony of form which both entertains and challenges their audiences.

Harvard students are ambitious as usual, always one step ahead of the game. Rather than waiting around for law school to join a prestigious law journal, the Harvard College Law Society created its own “Harvard Undergraduate Law Review,” publishing the inaugural issue on Sept. 15.
The journal marked the culmination of nearly a year of planning and writing by the law society, which in the past educated the pre-law community largely by hosting talks with prominent guest speakers. The 54-page journal includes articles ranging from informative pieces on the law school admissions process to analyses of court rulings and current events.
The society, under the leadership of senior Charles J.P. Hernandez ’11, is in the stages of planning for the second publication in the spring. In addition to the law society compers who will each contribute an article, certain professors will also write pieces. Also, the club will obtain articles from pre-law societies at Yale, Stanford and law schools in Mexico through an article exchange.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last weekend Harvard women’s golf hosted the first-ever Harvard Invitational in Bolton, Mass. Although the Crimson fell to Ivy foe Yale, the team and its young talent showed they could hold their own among the Ancient Eight. Here, sophomore golfer Katie Sylvan gives the inside info on what it’s like to play a sport that seems to sneak under the radar of just about every Harvard sports fan, the positive side of being called a dog, and the universal appeal of hot men with foreign accents. Every week, The Full-Court Press will give you the sort of personal scoop that you’re not likely to hear at a typical press conference.
 
Name: Katie Sylvan
Year: 2013
Stats: Sylvan established herself as one of the elite West Coast-golfers during her high school career, racking up numerous honors including a spot on 2009’s prestigious Cannon Cup West team. As a freshman at Harvard she was named first-team All-Ivy and was the conference coaches’ unanimous choice for Ivy League Rookie of the Year. In fall play this season, Sylvan has helped her team to favorable finishes in the Penn State Tournament and Harvard Invitational.
 
1.Typical pre-game meal.
I don't really have a typical meal per se. I just make sure to eat plenty. There's nothing worse than getting hungry on the course. My empty stomach tends to demand the majority of my attention. I have been known (by my team and others) to eat a rather obscene number of apples on the golf course. I believe my record was 8.
2. List four songs you listen to before games to get pumped up.
Sunny Hours-Long Beach Dub All-Stars
Little Secrets-Passion Pit
You've Got the Dirtee Love-Florence + The Machine & Dizzee Rascal
Good Day-Nappy Roots
3. Favorite team to play against and why?
I don't really have a preference of which teams we play. As long as I'm paired with two people who are willing to talk to me, I'm all set.
4. Most ridiculous thing that has taken place in your locker room team van.
What goes on in the van stays in the van (I'm sure you've never gotten that one before).
5. Most embarrassing moment you've had on the court/field/pool/track course, etc.
I may or may not have been running on a golf course. I wasn't exactly paying attention, and ended up running over the high side of a bunker. I did one of those midair cartoon runs before face planting into the sand.
6. Animal that best represents your style of play and why.
I've been told that I remind people of a golden retriever. I'm easy-going, friendly with my competitors, and let the bad stuff roll off my back pretty easily.
7. Most ridiculous thing you have heard a fan yell at a game you were playing in.
Fans?
8. If you could play for another sports team at Harvard, which would it be and why?
Football. I would want to see what it's like to play a sport that people actually watch.
9. Position you would play in Quidditch.
Beater. I could get out all of my pent-up aggression.
10. If you could go on a date with any professional athlete, who would it be and where would you take him/her?
Adam Scott. I don't typically watch golf on TV, but he is beautiful. Have you seen him? He's like the hot golfer reincarnate of Heath Ledger–Australian accent and all. I'm not exactly sure what we would do, but food would definitely be involved.

Don't want to miss the Harvard-Dartmouth football game but can't make the trip to Hanover? NESN has Crimson fans covered. On October 14th, the station announced that it would broadcast the game live on Oct. 30th, starting at 1:30 p.m.
The contest against the Big Green is one of only three Harvard football games that will be on TV this season. The other left on the schedule is The Game against Yale. The contest against the Dartmouth hasn't recently been one of the Crimson's marquee games–Harvard hasn't lost to the Big Green since 2003–but the game never fails to entertain. Just last year, in fact, the game turned into a heated contest–between two of the Crimson's running backs, senior Gino Gordon and sophomore Treavor Scales, to rush for more yards (Scales racked up 120 yards to Gordon's 119).
But the schools used to be much more competitive with each other. In Buddy Teevens's first year as Dartmouth head coach, the Big Green took two of its five games from Harvard, losing two, and tying the last, a 31-31 draw in Cambridge in 1991. The schools stayed competitive through the mid-90s.
The tide finally turned in 1997 when Harvard stomped on Dartmouth, 24-0, and the Crimson has hardly looked back since. Only the 2003 loss and a narrow 13-12 win in 2004 mar what has otherwise been a Harvard-dominated scene. The Big Green has been doing better this year, and currently boasts a 3-2 record though its Ivy mark stands at 0-2. Will Dartmouth ride homecoming weekend momentum to defeat the Crimson on TV? Or will Harvard win its seventh straight against the Big Green? Only time–and regional television–will tell.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra, under the direction of Federico Cortese, Senior Lecturer in Music, opened its concert season last Friday at Sanders Theater. The orchestra, now in its 203rd year, presented a diverse and demanding set of works, challenging its musicians to scale the loftiest of musical heights. They did so with apparent ease, especially in a riveting “New World Symphony.”
HRO began with Giuseppe Verdi’s overture to “I vespri siciliani.” Although this 1855 opera never achieved the same renown as Verdi’s other dramatic works, its dynamic overture remains popular in concert halls. HRO successfully conveyed the work’s central conflict between love and war. Ominous, textured chords punctuated by percussion foretold tragedy. Soon subtlety faded, and the orchestra embarked on a whirlwind journey through delicate pizzicato waltzes and percussive, militant rumbles. Exuberant brass evoked the spirit of battle, while cellos implied pure romance. HRO thus constructed a dizzying orchestral seesaw with expert dynamic control.
HRO next performed “Ritual Images,” by Dr. James Yannatos, conductor emeritus. Billed as a pastiche of classically American tunes—from Gershwin to the military ceremonial “Taps”—and passages from Johann Sebastian Bach’s “Mass in B Minor,” the work seeks to portray America’s cultural rituals through its musical traditions. Ultimately, these “images” came off as little more than a confused goody-bag of musical quotations, moving perpetually nearer to nowhere.
HRO ended their evening with Antonin Dvorak’s “Symphony No. 9, ‘From the New World,’” trekking every inch of the composer’s imagined frontier in a rampant display of collective virtuosity. Cortese took an unexpectedly brisk tempo in the opening movement, creating a strong sense of urgency and danger. This approach worked wonderfully for the movement’s robust first theme. For the second, contrasting theme, however, this tempo felt unnecessarily hasty. The symphony’s famed “Amen” movement was perhaps the highlight of the entire concert. Led by brilliant English horn soloist Miriam R. Farkas ’14, the orchestra conveyed a sumptuous, patiently resolved rendition. A fierce Scherzo and lightning-speed Allegro—especially in its ecstatic “Hiawatha” romp—closed the symphony with exhausted triumph.
