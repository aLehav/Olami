As the yellow curtain lifted and the lights slowly dimmed at the Boch Center Shubert Theatre, the audience beamed with enthusiasm awaiting the worldly- renowned Paul Taylor Dance Company, which hadn’t returned to Boston since before the pandemic in 2013. Pastel paint strokes hung from the ceiling adorning the stage, creating a vibrant and lively atmosphere even before the dancers leaped onstage. Suddenly, a saxophone tune broke through the silence and dancers wearing colorful costumes began to appear, signifying the start of a memorable night.
This performance, which ran from April 14 to April 16, featured two of Paul Taylor’s most popular works, 1998’s “Brandenburgs” and 1991’s “Company B,” as well as Amy Hall Garner’s recently commissioned piece “Somewhere in the Middle.” Taylor’s brilliant choreography created a blend of light and dark themes, carried out through seamless movements and intimate interactions between the dancers, weaving together a storyline that tugged at the heart.
Although Garner’s choreography shined on its own, the performance still managed to preserve Taylor’s timelessness. As the dancers floated across the stage with a childlike wonder and brilliant facial expressions in a fusion of athleticism and elegance to the sound of upbeat, vibrant jazz music, the performance took off with a captivating start. The dancers filled the theater with cheerfulness as they leapt, turned, jumped, and landed gracefully. The swift and rigorous movements contrasted with the dancers' gleeful faces and high-spirited hand gestures, making the dance all the more exciting: Truly, there was never a dull moment. The energetic choreography included soloists, partners carrying one another while one spun, and dancers who chased each other from the sides of the stage. There were even little surprises throughout the performance that caused the audience to erupt in laughter; a kiss on the cheek, waves towards the crowd, and snapping. The dancers executed perfect movements in a synchronized manner, but there also seemed to be a sense of freedom in their step, as if the dancers were letting the music guide them. Joyfulness radiated off the stage onto the audience, causing them to sway in their seats to music by Count Basie, Sarah Vaughan, Duke Ellington, and Bill Evans among others.
After the fascinating first act, the curtains lifted to reveal a darker scene where the dancers wore green velvet costumes with gold detailing. The atmosphere shifted from cheerful to poignant as the dancers walked softly to a beautiful string and piano melody. The second act performance of “Brandenburgs” evoked a sense of internal struggle and agony through powerful, precise, and efficient movements. A story of deep pain and anguish came through in the strenuous and vigorous athletic jumps, with the structured movements maintaining a flow to it all. John Harnage delivered a moving and emotional solo dance under a spotlight. Against a dark background that simulated a void, Harnage stood out with his classic ballet movements and heartbreaking facial expressions. As he managed to stay in one place while he spun and dropped to the ground, he gifted the crowd with an astonishing performance. To the music of the concertos of Johann Sebastian Bach, with a tempo that started slow and gradually sped up, the ensemble carried out a formal, synchronized, and linear performance. Furthermore, their ability to make a physically demanding choreography appear elegant and effortless was truly magnificent. The dancers Eran Bugge, Madelyn Ho ’08, Lee Duveneck, Alex Clayton, Devon Louis, Maria Ambrose, Shawn Lesniak, and Jake Vincent created something marvelous out of dark chaos with regal stances and smooth sprints across the stage.
Paying homage to Taylor’s brilliance and unmatched creativity, the full cast flooded the stage for “Company B,” with ten musical selections covered by the Andrews Sisters. The dancers shimmied, tapped their feet, and dipped their partners with wide smiles that radiated a spirit of joy. Set in the 1940s, the female dancers wore long flowing skirts and pants, white collared shirts, and red headbands, while the male dancers wore khaki pants and red belts. The music was uplifting and full of swing, but there was a stark contrast in the story being told through the movements. While the spirits were high, the dance forced the audience to grapple with the disheartening reality of a nation at war, death and loss haunting those home and abroad.
Once more, Harnage mesmerized the audience with his powerful leaps and charming ways as he danced to the tune of “Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy.” What at first appeared to be an upbeat and carefree performance in which Harnage let the music take control of his body eventually turned bone-chilling as it ended with another dancer being shot behind him. Similarly, the duality of light and dark was portrayed in the romantic and pain filled pas de deux performed by dancers Ambrose and Louis. The song “There Will Never Be Another You” was a sudden shift to a soft piano tune and melancholy singing. Notably, the dancers mirrored each other’s movements but never quite touched; at the same time, they moved in slow motion while shadows of men passed by. The dance ended on a heart-wrenching note as Ambrose rushed to Louis’ legs, holding on with all her might, only to be abandoned, leaving the audience with a distraught and empty feeling.
As the night came to an end, the full cast danced to the same song with which they opened: “Company B.” The lights shone brightly, as the cast snapped their fingers and spun in unison with an enchanting passion once more. But as the lights dimmed, a mournful look replaced their once joyful smiles, signifying that suffering had changed the world. The Paul Taylor Dance Company left the audience completely stunned and in awe of the emotional journey it took them on, abundant with vitality and touching on human emotion.

All for arts and arts for all. Presented by the Office for the Arts, the Harvard ARTS FIRST Festival is an annual, four day celebration of the visual and performing arts at Harvard College. Every year spawns new acts and representations of art, and this year was no exception. This year’s festival featured an assortment of senior theses, the 28th Harvard First-year Musical “Post Mortem,” a number of public art pieces displayed throughout the Yard, several craft stations in the Science Center Plaza, and so much more. The scale of this event itself represented the time and effort Harvard students, faculty, staff, alumni, and affiliates dedicate to their creative endeavors.
Claudine Gay, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean and Harvard President-elect, attested to the festival’s allure.
“I don’t even know when I started attending ARTS FIRST, it’s been a long time, but every year it’s incredibly inspiring” she said. “It seems to get better every year, if that’s even possible.”
Gay cited the event’s infectious joy as a reason to keep coming back.
“Realizing how much joy the arts bring to not only everyone in the audience but clearly the performers.”
The energy and enjoyment of the arts was impactful and memorable, and something that everyone — not just those affiliated with Harvard College, but the City of Cambridge as a whole — looks forward to each year.
“I just think it’s a great way of bringing our whole community together,” Gay said.
Julia M. Yanez ’24, a Crimson editor, saw this community-building first hand while working on the “Wheel Throwing” exhibit. Here, Yanez and fellow student Maya Peña-Lobel ’24 demonstrated how to create ceramic pieces using a potter’s wheel.
“I wasn’t someone who grew up around having art, so it’s been really nice to be able to pick up ceramics this year, and, now, being able to share that joy with someone else has been really lovely,” Yanez said. “It seems like there’s a lot of really happy faces around here, so it’s nice to be a part of it.”
In addition to her work with ceramics, Peña-Lobel also performed with Harvard Fallen Angels acapella group.
“I do Environmental Engineering, and I feel like I don’t get to express the artistic side of myself, or engage with the arts community here on campus or in the larger Cambridge community, so it's really special to promote that and let arts take the center stage,” she said.
Art offers a unique balance and refuge. Both Yanez and Peña-Lobel agreed that this is an event that they would return to next year.
Alexa Albanese, an Administrative Staff Member of the Office for the Arts, defined the Festival as a space to admire, create, and find joy within each other through art.
“This is the culmination of the artwork at the Office of the Arts that we do every year. It's being able to share creativity and art with the community,” she said.
Many members in the crowd attended the festival for the first time this year — many came in support of a friend, or roommate who was performing. Regardless of the purpose for being there, the diversity of the artists alongside the diversity in the types of art was apparent to all.
Experiencing such artistic vision sparked confidence among some members of the crowd — in fact, many audience members could be overheard expressing their excitement to return again next year — even as performers.
Much like the events from the festival ignited curiosity and wonder in viewers, the ARTS FIRST Festival sparked a sense of unity across the Harvard community.

As one of Max (formerly known as HBO Max)’s newest shows, “Love and Death” is set up as an enticing retelling of a small town Texas true story. In the ’80s, an otherwise white picket town is sent reeling after a brutal ax murder is committed and dark secrets seep into the spotlight.
Candace “Candy” Montgomery (Elizabeth Olsen) is a bored housewife seeking fulfillment who falls into an affair with a married man, Allan Gore (Jesse Plemons). Throughout the premiere episodes, the story progresses through the extent of the affair and the impacts it has on both of the marriages involved. Everything seems cozy in Wylie, Texas until Betty Gore (Lily Rabe), Allan’s wife, confronts Candy about the past affair, pulling an ax from behind her back. The following episodes explore both the shocking murder and the disgraceful affair which may have caused it.
In the first three episodes, it feels as if the story’s accuracy comes at the expense of audience satisfaction or pacing. With the series description focusing on the effects of a murder on a small town, it seems odd to spend three episodes of a one season limited series devoted to background information. Yes, the intimacy developed with the characters is necessary for viewers to be invested in the outcome of the story. However, the slow introduction could have performed better as a single, traditional premiere episode. With only seven episodes to complete the story, “Love and Death” suffers from false marketing. With the increasing popularity in true crime, and the way that “Love and Death” was situated as the next up and coming true crime show, it is disingenuous to instead present an audience with yet another bored housewife drama.
As a true story, the tale of Betty Gore’s murder may demand an emphasis and exploration of the years leading up to the event, a sacrifice by David E. Kelley to portray the story as honestly as possible.
The coming episodes might still redeem the first three, but currently they feel like a cheap recreation of the compelling narrative used in Kelley’s “Big Little Lies.” There are the same initial teases of what tantalizing, blood-wrenching event will befall a comfortable community, but perhaps this true story didn’t require a tease and instead a succinct introduction — allowing for the victim’s narrative to shine through as these true stories garner the attention they deserve. True crime shouldn’t be about pulling drama out of the woodwork, but should be an opportunity to bring previously-silenced stories to the forefront. As it stands, “Love and Death” seems more focused on dramatizing Betty Gore’s life than telling the horrible tale of how it came to an end.
Despite the frustratingly dramatic and slow crawl of the first three episodes, there are some occasional highlights. The first of which is Elizabeth Olsen’s harrowing depiction of a mother and wife turned unabashed adulterer. Olsen’s portrayal is calculated, down to the cunning looks shared during coffee hour at church or the tense laughs when spouses are nearby. Every scene revolves around Candy because Olsen makes this character come to life.
The second redeeming quality of “Love and Death” so far is the scoring, done by Jeff Russo. With subtle emphasis given to the tense moments where Allan and Candy begin outlining the rules of their affair and the crescendos as they begin falling in love over the course of their forbidden relationship, the music throughout the show acts as the perfect emphatic device. Not a single interaction or scene contains generic music simply intended to fill empty space. Instead, the variety of ’70s and ’80s era chart-toppers bounce perfectly off of composed auditory backdrops to even the most mundane tupperware-laden pre-lunch scene.
At its core, “Love and Death” is a story worth telling, but it currently feels like none of the story has been unearthed. While Olsen shines in her role and is excellently emboldened by compelling scoring, the rest of the show is noticeably lacking. With new episodes coming out every Thursday, it will be interesting to see if the rest of the show can find its footing once the infamous crime finally takes place.

A New Hampshire man was arrested Tuesday by the FBI and is accused of planting a fake bomb on Harvard University’s campus last month as an accomplice in an effort to secure a “large” amount of Bitcoin from the University, court records say.
William A. Giordani, 55, is alleged to have placed a tool bag containing a metal safe, wires, and fireworks, which authorities believed to be a bomb, on a bench in Harvard’s Science Center Plaza — leading to the plaza’s evacuation on April 13. He has been charged with aiding and abetting interstate conspiracy and making extortionate threats following a joint investigation by the Harvard University Police Department, the Cambridge Police Department, and the FBI.
FBI spokesperson Kristen M. Setera confirmed Wednesday that the FBI took Giordani into custody “without incident” in Nashua, New Hampshire on Tuesday. She declined to provide further comment.
On April 13, Harvard University Police received a series of seven phone calls starting at 2:27 p.m. from a caller with a seemingly “computer-generated male voice” who claimed to have placed three bombs around Harvard’s campus, according to a criminal complaint unsealed Tuesday. The caller demanded payment in the form of a Bitcoin transaction and told authorities that the bombs would detonate if the demands were not met within 100 minutes.
“There are three bombs planted around the Harvard Campus and we are ready to provide undeniable proof,” the voice said, according to the complaint. “Non-compliance with our orders will result in immediate detonation of all three devices and the death or injury of hundreds of students.”
After the caller revealed the Science Center Plaza as the location of one of the alleged bombs, HUPD located the tool bag and began clearing out the area at around 3:40 p.m. According to an officer’s affidavit, the Cambridge Police Department’s Explosive Ordinance Disposal Unit completed a “controlled destruction using a robotic device.”
A loud noise was heard in the area, but HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano previously said that there “was not an explosion” and that the noise was from the use of a water cannon.
Catalano declined to comment on Giordani’s arrest.
Officials spotted Giordani — described as “white male wearing a blue short sleeved shirt and shorts” — placing a red and black Husky tool bag on a bench between two food trucks at approximately 2:10 p.m. on a YouTube livestream of the Science Center Plaza operated by Harvard Common Spaces, according to the complaint.
Giordani told authorities that he had been directed to place the bag in Science Center Plaza through an April 11 Craigslist ad by someone under the name “Nguyen Mihn” who claimed to be the Vietnamese parent of a Harvard student, according to the filing.
Giordani explained when he traveled to Worcester for payment, the complaint reads, the person refused to meet with him and told Giordani that he was not Asian, nor did he have children as the ad had claimed. The person then began “spouting off” racist and anti-Semitic comments, Giordani said according to the complaint.
When officers asked about the incident at Harvard, Giordani said he “just put some fireworks in a safe and put them at Harvard,” according to the complaint.
Federal Public Defender Jane Peachy was temporarily appointed as Giordani’s attorney at an initial hearing Tuesday. Peachy confirmed that she is representing Giordani but declined to comment.
Giordani will appear in U.S. District Court Friday for a detention hearing.
Correction: May 3, 2023
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the evacuation of Harvard’s Science Center Plaza took place on April 14. In fact, the evacuation took place on April 13.

Jane J. Kim, a professor of health economics, will serve as interim dean of the Harvard School of Public Health as the search for the school’s next permanent dean continues, University President-elect Claudine Gay announced Thursday morning.
Kim, who currently serves as dean for academic affairs at HSPH, will officially assume the role on July 1. The announcement is the first major public update in the four dean searches Gay inherited as president-elect. She is leading the search for the next School of Public Health dean with University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76.
Outgoing HSPH Dean Michelle A. Williams announced in November that she would depart at the end of the 2022-23 academic year, after serving seven years in the role. High leadership turnover marked Williams’ tenure as dean, with faculty weighing a rare vote of no confidence against her amid allegations that she and her deputy fostered a toxic culture at the school.
Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow launched the search for Williams’ successor, before handing it over to Gay after her selection in December 2022 as the University’s 30th president.
Kim’s selection as interim HSPH dean is the second major personnel decision Gay has made in recent days, announcing on Tuesday that University Marshal Katherine O’Dair will serve as her presidential chief of staff.
In an email to School of Public Health affiliates, Gay praised Kim as a “highly regarded colleague, mentor, and leader.”
“Since 2020, through her work in the dean’s office, she has helped to augment support for junior faculty, to strengthen educational offerings, and to articulate and develop research priorities,” Gay wrote. “At the same time, she has expanded knowledge of health policy issues related to women’s health and has built partnerships between Harvard and the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Cancer Institute, among others.”
“Her ability to imagine, create, and sustain connections will serve her well as she serves the School,” Gay added.
Kim graduated from HSPH in 2001 with a master’s degree in Health Policy and Management and from the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 2005 with a doctorate in Health Policy and Decision Sciences before joining HSPH as professor in 2006. Her research centers around evaluating women’s health policy issues through the development and application of mathematical models. She has used her models to analyze the cost-effectiveness of cervical cancer screening methods across several countries.
Kim was formerly co-chair of the Faculty Council and of the Committee on the Advancement of Women Faculty. She has also served as a member of the Committee on Education Policy and the steering committee of the Zhu Family Center for Global Cancer Prevention.
