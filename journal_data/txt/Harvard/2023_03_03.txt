After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I was a kid, I would go to a theme park in Colombia called Divercity that simulated adult life for children. I would work different jobs, like putting out fires or driving a taxi. I’d then get paid fake money, which I could then use at a variety of stores and restaurants within the park.
I found the whole concept very interesting. I’d perform useless routines that had no value in and of themselves. Yet because they were performed within the context of a larger game, I’d get rewarded with real food.
Sadly, in 2020, the financial crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic forced Divercity to close. That’s why I was surprised to find it again just off Mass Ave.
This Divercity was different, though. It was more polished, more academic. Instead of fighting fake fires, its participants studied tort law. Instead of redeeming fake pesos for tasty pasta dishes, they redeemed other pieces of paper for six figure salaries.
The Divercity I’m talking about, is of course, Harvard Law School, the subject of this week’s column. Throughout my conversations with students, I arrived at a picture of a school that, although lauded by its students for its academic excellence and collaborative student community, still felt, in some ways, fake.
***
Let’s back up. Overall, students at HLS seem to have a positive view of the school. Henrique D. Neves ’22, a first-year law student at the school, told me that he found the academics to be quite rigorous.
“I often tell people that nothing that I could have done before law school could have possibly prepared me for 1L,” he said.“It’s definitely tough.”
Even amidst the rigorous curriculum, Neves emphasized that the collaborative environment within the student population has been invaluable.
“Despite the general level of exhaustion, the workload that comes with it, there’s nothing more rewarding than having people that you’re doing it alongside with that are going through the same things,” he said.
Owen L. Averbuch, a first-year law student at HLS, echoed these sentiments.
“In the end,” he told me, “it’s going to be the people in my class who are going to be caring, who I’m going to stay in touch with.”
Slowly, though, I began to notice a specter hanging over this rosy picture.
Many students enter law school looking to serve the public good through public interest work. Neves, for his part, told me that “the majority of people that I’ve interacted with have been really on the more advocacy-centered side of things, where they have a particular cause that they’re really passionate about.”
Yet despite this interest, limited opportunities in public service law often force students to take jobs at large corporate law firms instead. Financial incentives certainly play a large role here as well. The median salary for first years at private law firms is $165,000, while at some public interest firms, salaries start between $40,000 and $50,000.
Averbuch told me that for students interested in public interest law, “you kind of have to carve out a little bit of a niche here to… not get so crazy, because people were talking about making $200,000 a year versus 50 or 65 with a quarter of a million dollars-plus of law school debt.”
There may be more than just the price tag attracting students to these jobs, though. In the past, some students have argued that besides the financial incentive, there is an institutional push at HLS towards the private sector.
Many post-graduation jobs at corporate law firms are secured by receiving a return offer after working as a summer associate at the firm the summer after your second year. These summer associate jobs are in turn obtained through HLS’s Early Interview Program, a two week recruiting program for private law firms held at the start of your second year. The EIP is such an integral part of the system at HLS that if you miss the sign up, the school will send you an email reminding you to do so. The same policy doesn’t seem to be followed for public sector jobs.
This debate is nothing new. People have been making this critique of HLS for years. In his 1999 book “Broken Contract: A Memoir of Harvard Law School,” Richard D. Kahlenberg critiques the school’s role in pushing students away from pursuing jobs in public interest and towards corporate law firms.
Potentially in response to complaints like these, HLS began emphasizing public interest law. In 2008, in an effort to encourage students to consider these careers, HLS waived tuition for third-year law students who promised to spend five years working for either nonprofit organizations or the government. In addition, the school began offering a variety of fellowships aimed to support students who pursue public sector or nonprofit jobs.
Yet the problem seems to continue. Josh M. Alpert, a second-year student at HLS, told me that students are still either “forced to do things like big law, because they have a lot of student loans, or they feel like they're forced to do it. Either one ends up having the same result, which is why you see increasingly low public interest numbers.”
Only 68 graduates of the class of 2021 went into public interest, while 456 went into private law firms or judicial clerkships.
If HLS has made such an active effort to facilitate entry to a public interest career, why do some students still feel as if they’re being groomed for corporate law?
One possible answer is simple: That’s the way the world works. No matter what law school you attend, you’ll be faced with the same dilemma. We’ve seen this at the College, too, with students feeling that six figure salaries offered by finance or consulting firms are pulling them away from their true career goals.
But I think that the problem goes beyond simply an attractive salary. The prevalence of corporate law within student life at the law school is a product of the fetishization and commercialization of success.
Harvard Law School defines itself through success. The school doesn’t attempt to emphasize its role in, say, promoting upward mobility. Instead, it recognizes that its goal is excellence in the legal field. It aims to produce the best lawyers, the best teachers, the best entrepreneurs, and the best leaders.
Many HLS alumni have vindicated that mission. Yet not every HLS graduate is going to be President of the United States. This presents a problem. Are a couple of famous alumni every few years really enough to satisfy the school’s thirst for success?
This is where corporate law comes in. If you can’t be president, why not settle for a six figure salary? In a country where the median worker makes around $40,000 a year, making four times that your first year out of law school seems like success to me.
Of course, it can’t be too easy. In reality, success is the uncertain product of hard work and failure. For most, success is never ensured, and only comes after moments of deep frustration.
Thus, if every Harvard Law graduate could breeze through three years of legal education and expect several hundred thousand dollars placed in their hand purely by virtue of the “H” stamped on their forehead, the illusion of success would be shattered. Instead, there needs to be a way to ensure that students undergo the hardships necessary to merit “success.” This is where grades come in.
Grades are perhaps the most important factor in determining your job after law school. This makes them the perfect tool to simulate the hard work that real success necessitates.
HLS takes the epic journey that is the search for success and condenses it into a more palatable three years of academic struggle. While the 1L curriculum for most law schools is only four courses, at Harvard, students take five. These courses culminate with eight hour exams that often count for your entire grade. With corporate law summer associate positions on the line, students compete for the top grades during an academic year that has become notorious for its rigor.
Institutions like the Harvard Law Review also serve as proxies for real world struggle. Alpert told me that “a lot of either judges, or firms, or organizations care a lot about the Law Review.”
Alpert added that spending time working at the Law Review is “definitely a brutal two years.”
“Not a lot of people I met enjoyed it,” he said. “They do it because it’s part of the thing that’ll help you out.”
Save for those students who want to go into legal academia or do specific appellate clerkships, he told me, “it’s not really relevant to what you’re doing.”
This is where I see the link between HLS and Divercity, the Colombian theme park. When I put out a fake fire, there wasn’t any real value in what I was doing. Similarly, it seems to me that the academic intensity of HLS, both through classes and organizations like the Harvard Law Review, has minimal value in and of itself. Instead, its value comes partly from the fact that corporate law firms have implicitly endorsed the rules of the game.
At HLS, students go through what Alpert called a “three year hazing” to receive a degree that corporate law firms have agreed to value at hundreds of thousands of dollars.
This isn’t to say that students learn nothing of value at HLS. They certainly do. The Law School has not gained the reputation it has now without providing one of the best legal educations in the country. You see this in its innumerable alumni who have found real success outside of large salaries.
However, HLS adds a culture of intensity to their education that seems to me to be of no educational value, and rather only serves as a token within the game of corporate law.
Corporate law firms offer HLS students a 10 step plan to success. Together with HLS, they take the idea of success, remove the risk, and return it to students as a simulacrum of the real thing.
This is a problem familiar to most students at the College. Why take a risk and become a writer when you can ensure a hefty salary in the finance industry and pay off loans? The latter version of success seems just as enticing as the first.
My conversations with HLS students have led me to rethink my own definitions of success. Sometimes it’s easy to get caught up in the game, and to rely too heavily on the safe route. Yet when given opportunities like those offered by Harvard, it might be worth it to take the path less traveled.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many experts have considered the United States the dominant world power since World War II, a timeframe spanning the lives of all current Harvard undergraduates.
But this status may change within our lifetimes. It increasingly appears that China might displace the U.S. as the world’s leading superpower. This isn’t shocking news; it’s a story that has been unfolding over several decades and is top-of-mind for many American political and economic commentators — as well as students here, in courses tracing China’s recent ascent.
There are two tailwinds that continue to support China’s climb.
The first is a fundamental economic fact: China’s economy is growing faster than the U.S.’s. Today, the American GDP is still bigger by roughly $5.6 trillion, but this might change soon. According to the Centre for Economics and Business Research, China will overtake the United States as the world’s largest economy by 2036 — just around a decade after most of us graduate.
While the first tailwind is well-understood, the second tailwind is not. Technology is an equally powerful force reinforcing China’s growth, but not in the way you might expect.
China has invested heavily in artificial intelligence — and has state surveillance feeds that can provide the large datasets needed to improve their models. Some have started to see an “AI race” between China and the United States, with similar “races” happening across other fields, such as biotechnology and cybersecurity.
But what might prove to be more impactful than China’s use of technology is its non-use of it. China’s authoritarian government tightly controls technology on a large scale: restricting some kinds (gaming) and outright banning others (cryptocurrency).
Why? In our last piece, we explored the history and impact of the printing press, which, while definitely much older, reflects many of the same patterns of new technologies. The printing press undeniably kindled lots of good — such as increased knowledge transfer and monumental leaps in scientific discovery — but it also supercharged the spread of disinformation and spurred political and religious conflicts.
It’s always difficult to prognosticate, but today’s technological waves — including artificial intelligence, decentralized ledgers, and biotechnology, to name a few — despite their appealing applications, could have similarly destabilizing effects.
To take a topical example, large language models (like ChatGPT) could at some point do human-quality knowledge work, leading some to predict large-scale layoffs in white-collar service industries in the next five years. This would leave millions needing to “re-skill,” potentially translating to widespread unrest. It would put our institutions — and our social fabric — to the test.
Further, as technologies become increasingly powerful, the possible harm that can be caused by bad actors using those technologies also increases. This “dual-use” dynamic of technology appears in many cases. For example, synthetic biology has been used to advance breakthrough treatments in blood cancer research, but also to develop pox viruses from scratch. In a future where the barrier to creating a deadly virus might be dangerously low, how can society be protected?
China seemingly has the answer. Their strictly-enforced bans, restrictions, and regulations appear to minimize dual-use risk and destabilizing forces of technology. This extent of control is a lever that the United States realistically does not have. This raises an important question for the United States: Is the Chinese model better suited for the 21st century? Perhaps restricting freedom can lead to prosperity, as Lee Kuan Yew argued for many decades in Singapore. Should governments emulate China in response to potentially destabilizing frontier technologies?
The answer is no, for two reasons.
First, aggressively restricting technology can lead to missing out on progress. The United States prides itself on its experimental ethos, a core value that has historically led us to a better future. We’d be mistaken to turn back on it now.
Second, and more importantly, trying to manage the adverse effects of technology through heavy governmental interference creates a new danger: an uber-powerful government capable of using these sophisticated technologies maliciously. It’s unclear what the future of advanced technologies will look like — whether highly positive, negative, or, more likely, falling somewhere in between — but regardless, we should prioritize maintaining our current liberties.
From biotechnology labs to classrooms in Harvard Kennedy School, we’re fortunate to be part of an institution that plays multiple roles in the unfolding story of technological advancement and U.S-China relations. But as we think particularly about these so-called technology races with China, it’s important to remember that technological competitiveness is not all that matters.
Given the American inclination towards free experimentation over authoritarian regulation, the work we do here — both technological and governmental — to protect ourselves against the ugly side of technological progress is crucial to the national interest. The challenge is more than simply building the better mousetrap; it’s also making sure the hammer doesn’t backfire.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Low voter turnout, uncontested positions, and Sidechat scandals, oh my! For the second-ever time since the dissolution of the four-decade-old Undergraduate Council last spring, the Harvard Undergraduate Association concluded an election featuring an all-too-familiar menagerie of beasts — and unfortunately, it looks like no amount of tapping our ruby slippers together will allow us to escape.
From the HUA to its predecessor, our apathy is a structural feature of these elections, rather than their particular exception. In each cycle, Harvard students wonder how so much toxicity can surround an organization so detached from their lives.
It appears that the HUA does not truly ‘govern’ the study body, in any practical sense of the term. Stuck as the intermediary between Harvard’s administration and its mass of students, the HUA has a cramped area of power to enact policy in. While we value the HUA’s prior advocacy in bringing us low-cost summer storage, textbook stipends, and a professional clothing closet, it is only one among many organizations that meaningfully change our campus.
Nor do its members serve as venerable ideological or ethical leaders for the student body — this would stray too far from their role description. We look not to the HUA, but to a diverse mosaic of clubs and Houses more representative of our individual values and experiences, to direct our day-to-day and overarching ambitions.
Instead, the primary function of the HUA is pecuniary: allocating the hundreds of thousands of dollars generated by our term-billed Student Activities Fees to various student initiatives and organizations.
There are those who would relegate club funding to the Dean of Students Office for the neutrality and maturity its adults hold. But we believe that a centralized funding body should remain in the hands of students who can speak to undergraduate needs — as long as they withdraw from other organizations to diminish conflicts of interest. While neutral on face, a University administrator making value judgements about which student-led initiatives deserve to stay afloat each year is a perilous system.
Ironically, we may have the HUA itself to thank for helping us realize its true purpose. When the HUA constitution dissolved the prior UC-led system of House and Yard representation, the illusion of a representative entity dissolved as well. This recent election, just slightly over a quarter of undergraduates could be bothered to fill out a ballot that was, given its virtual nature, literally delivered to the palms of their hands; plus, all but one non-presidential officer election ended up uncontested.
Such a student government cannot be said to represent our vast student body — but we can hold it accountable for funding.
For too long, the central funding function has been drowned out by campaigns encapsulated by performative gestures and unnecessary character attacks. A fiery, sensationalized campaign season exemplifies the glorification of the humble, dull work we want from the HUA, and the toxicity this overemphasis invites.
We hope that a reprioritization of funding as the HUA’s singular responsibility can redeem the student body’s perception of student government. The current hatred of the HUA actively hurts the credibility of the opt-in Student Activities Fee, potentially disincentivizing students from investing in the one operation that student government should perform and that all students benefit from.
To protect and prioritize this essential function of the HUA, the administration should cover the Student Activities Fee with financial aid. At the same time, the ability of the administration to restore our engagement with a form of student government that has been marred by controversy in each of its lifetimes is limited. It’s up to students to reject the illusion that the HUA’s dominion extends beyond the monetary. It’s time to recognize the student government behind the curtain for what it really is.

Joseph D. Harris ’72 is a mathematician in the field of algebraic geometry and Harvard’s Math 55 professor.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
FM: You’ve been studying math for the majority of your life. What do you think initially drew you to the subject? 
JDH: I don’t know. I’ve wondered about that myself. I think it might have been that my father wanted to be a mathematician, but he was growing up during the Depression and that wasn't an option. Among other things, he was Jewish, and at that time, universities, by and large, still had quotas on the number of Jews that they would hire. In any case, he wound up going into medicine, but I suspect he always maintained that interest in math and somehow communicated it to me before I knew any better.
FM: What part of your research into algebraic geometry is most exciting to you? And can you explain it in a way that would make sense to a high school math student?
JDH: Algebraic geometry, it’s something that you’ve encountered already, I suspect. When you describe a geometric object like a circle as a locus of points in the plane xy, whose coordinates satisfy a polynomial equation. So in this case, x squared plus y squared equals 1. And the question of algebraic geometry in general is what’s the relationship between the algebra of the polynomials and the geometry of the figure that they describe. The subject has undergone a lot of revisions, but that’s fundamentally the question.
FM: In the past, you’ve said that nothing you think about could not have been imagined by the Italian geometers who were foundational to the field of algebraic geometry, and that if you enjoy greater success than them, it’s because you have access to better tools. Could you elaborate on this and how technological development has been helpful? 
JDH: I think in very rough terms, in the 19th century, when the subject really got underway, people still had a relatively informal style. And ultimately, that reached its limits, and a large part of the 20th century was devoted to putting the subject on a more rigorous foundation. And the result of that was the introduction of a lot of new ideas and techniques that made it possible to revisit some of the problems that they had talked about or thought about in the 19th century, but were unable to resolve then. In some sense, that’s how I make my living.
FM: More so than ever before, today many students opt for what they consider “practical” concentrations that can easily be applied to careers. Why do you believe that pure math should still hold a place in higher education, despite its abstractness? 
JDH: There is, certainly, applications of mathematics to adjacent fields — computer science, physics, even economics — and I can get out of the question by citing those. But in fact, I think there’s also a framework of mind that mathematics teaches that I think is valuable, no matter what you go into.
FM: And what do you mean by that — “the framework that it teaches?”
JDH: It’s a very, very strict logical structure, that things are either true or not true, and they’re either provable or not provable. And occasionally, by dint of effort, we can move something from the first column to the second column, or rather from the second column to the first. But, the basic idea that there is a logical structure that is determinative — is fundamental — to the subject, and I think it’s a useful framework to have in other respects.
FM: Math 55 is known as one of the hardest undergraduate classes at Harvard — and in the country. Do you think that Math 55’s notorious reputation is accurate? 
JDH: No. I became aware last year that Math 55 was having a moment on social media, and I looked at some of the videos and things, and they’re wildly inaccurate. The fact is, it is a very hard, challenging course. We cover a lot of material, and we do so in what I think is pretty rigorous fashion. But we have the students. The students who show up in 55, they can handle it. They can do it. So I don’t think it's that much of a killer course as it’s made out to be.
FM: How would you describe the students that are drawn to the course — aside from their passion for math? Do you worry that capable students who don’t think they fit that mold turn themselves away from the course? 
JDH: Well, we try to make it accessible to everybody. Especially if you haven't seen a lot of the material already in one form or another, I suspect it probably would be pretty time consuming. But I think basically, we’ve encouraged everybody to just give it a try, come to a few lectures. The math department — I don’t know how it is in other departments — but we were all unanimously very upset at the end of shopping period.
Because that was what we would tell students — if you’re not sure if you want to take 55, come to the first week of lectures and then decide. But I think the students who do take it and succeed, they’re mostly kids who were sort of outliers in their high school. And I think for them, what's really a wonderful experience is being in a community of peers, for the first time for most of them.
FM: In 2017, The Crimson published an article about the Math Department at Harvard and the gender divide within it, and it stated that less than 7 percent of Math 55 students were women between the years of 2012 and 2017. How does that statistic compare to today, as far as you know? And how do you think the math department should or is expanding its reach to female students? 
JDH: Wow, 7 percent, you said?
FM: Less than 7 percent, in those five years. 
JDH: That’s fairly upsetting. But I have to say that it’s not like that. We’re not up to 50 percent, but we’re getting there. I think we’ve just basically tried to make the course as accessible to everyone as we possibly can. And I don’t know. I think we’re succeeding. But I’m not the one to judge.
FM: Despite the difficulty of Math 55, many students laud the wonderful community they are able to build through the class. How have you built, or seen students build, that community in your own class? 
JDH: I think the idea is that — and this is something we really encourage the students to do — if the students will talk to each other about basically the material and specifically about the problem sets that are due every week. The course is based on weekly problem sets, and students can talk about them in section and office hours and with each other.
It really doesn’t take long in my experience for the students to get to know each other, or at least a subset of the rest of the class that they can talk to and work with. That’s, in fact, I think that's the great thing about the course is exactly building that community.
FM: You went to Harvard as an undergraduate. Did you take Math 55 when you were here? 
JDH: I did, but it was a completely different course back then. It didn’t serve the same purpose either. One thing that’s changed since back then is that students coming out of high school have a much more solid foundation in abstract mathematics than they did back then. So we can do very different things in 55 now than we did back then.
FM: What house were you in? 
JDH: I was in Adams House for a year and then I moved off campus so I was officially Dudley. And I wound up my last semester at the Co-op house.
FM: Did you like it? 
JDH: Oh, I loved it. That was where I felt I belonged, somehow.
FM: So you’ve been here for a long time. Do you have a favorite hidden gem location at Harvard or in the Square? 
JDH: I used to like to hang out in the stacks in Widener, but I haven’t been there for decades now.
You just wander around and pick up random books and see what they’re about.
FM: Often, our 15 Questions series focuses on the successes of the people that we profile. Can you share one of your failures?
JDH: Well, it’s funny because in math, it’s rare that you would decide to fix on a specific concrete goal, and then either achieve it or not. Usually, it’s a matter of exploration. And if you think of it in those terms, you know, you’re trying to explore new territory. There really isn’t a notion of success or failure. If you’re trying to climb a mountain then you either get to the top or you don’t, right. But here it’s more a matter of just wandering around and seeing what you can find.
FM: If you weren’t a mathematician, what do you think you would be doing instead? 
JDH: I’ve fantasized about being a cook. But that’s, you know, that’s a fantasy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Panelists discussed Chinese energy policy, surveillance, artificial intelligence, and leader priorities at the fourth Dean’s Symposium on Social Science Innovations on Thursday.
Titled “China in Focus: New Social Science Approaches,” the event was hosted by Harvard Dean of Social Science Lawrence D. Bobo as part of the running Dean’s Symposium series that began in 2021. Vice Provost for International Affairs and History professor Mark C. Elliott moderated the discussion.
Panelists included Sociology professor Ya-Wen Lei, History of Science professor Victor K.G. Seow, Government professor Yuhua Wang, and Economics professor David Y. Yang.
“The world’s attention seems focused on China in a way that just is relentless,” Elliott said. “I can tell you that was not always the case.”
Lei and Yang both expressed concern about what they described as China’s growing use of technology to constrain personal freedoms.
Lei said China has employed “surveillance capitalism” to maintain power, adding that China has a “mixed ideology of techno-nationalism, technological fetishism, and meritocracy that tend to justify social exclusion and inequality.”
Though Lei said she believes China approaches policy making with science and objectivity, she said many times “the real outcome diverges from what they want.”
Yang, who discussed the mutually beneficial relationship between AI and autocratic states like China, said technology has the potential to shift the world’s political equilibrium in favor of authoritarian governments.
He added weak democracies and other governments tend to buy AI technology from China when experiencing public unrest.
“In the year when there is local political unrest, there is a substantial increase in the likelihood that that country is purchasing facial recognition AI services from China,” Yang said.
“It could generate a spreading of similar autocratic regimes to the rest of the world,” he added.
Wang argued that Chinese rulers cannot prioritize both staying in power and creating a powerful state because a strong state requires empowering elites, who can then overthrow the leader.
“If you want to stay in power as long as possible, you have to have an incoherent elite — you need to fragment the elites,” Wang said. “If the elites are too coherent, if they trust each other, they can take actions; then the ruler is in danger.”
Wang added that a fourth of all Chinese emperors were assassinated by elites around them.
Seow said China, along with many other countries, embraced what he called a “carbon technocracy” in development by using mass energy extraction.
Historically, energy extraction has carried “staggering human and environmental costs,” he added.
“Some scholars say that China has been experiencing a gilded age, but there is a dark side behind the gilded facade,” Lei said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many student organizations, faculty groups, and House Committees will need to replace their current mailing list infrastructure after the Harvard Computer Society announced in January that it plans to retire its longtime list server offering at the end of the spring semester.
Founded in the 1980s, HCS is the largest student-run computer science club on campus. It began offering its mailing list service to student organizations in 1993 — before Harvard developed its own offering. Though some organizations have since pivoted to alternative methods, HCS mailing lists remain crucial to many Harvard organizations’ communications.
HCS Co-Presidents Michael Y. Zhao ’25 and Kelly J. Ding ’25 wrote that the group made the decision to phase out the mailing lists because the service’s infrastructure is “quickly aging.”
“Large-scale email communication has become easier for individuals and organizations to achieve without necessarily relying on HCS systems and resources,” Zhao and Ding wrote in an email. “As interest in computer science continues to skyrocket, we are now planning to retire our mailing list services in order to focus more on our mission of fostering a vibrant, diverse, and welcoming CS community on campus.”
The mailing lists system’s shutdown follows a series of controversies in recent years, including security concerns and technical failures.
In February 2017, The Crimson alerted HCS and Harvard affiliates that more than 1.4 million emails containing sensitive information about users of HCS’s mailing lists were publicly accessible — prompting the club to make their lists private.
The emails included professors’ discussions of students’ grades, private correspondences from Harvard College administrators including Dean Khurana, financial aid information, membership of LGBTQ+ organizations, drafts of a final exam, and at least one person’s social security number.
In April 2022, HCS mailing lists went down for a week due to an expired SSL certificate and connectivity issues with the organization’s remote Amazon Web Server. Students subscribed to the mail lists lost the ability to send and receive emails to their mailing lists.
HCS has said that its email lists will remain operational until the end of the spring semester.
In a Jan. 18 follow-up email, HCS outlined alternative offerings for organization leaders to utilize after HCS’ email lists are terminated. William C. Cooper ’23-’24 wrote in the email that student organizations should adopt the Student Organization Center Online communication system, which was introduced last year, and suggested house mailing lists transition to the mail system provided by Harvard University Information Technology.
Cooper recommended other groups and unrecognized clubs set up mailing lists using personal email addresses.
“If you are an organization leader who needs access to your email list membership or archives, or have any other questions, you can reach out to the HCS Board,” Cooper wrote. “We are happy to help assist in making as smooth of a transition to new mailing list services as possible, whether that be to Google Groups, the new SOCO platform, or any other service.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University President Lawrence S. Bacow will travel to Jordan, Israel, and Palestine later this month in one of his last international trips before leaving office later this year.
Bacow is scheduled to meet with Harvard alumni throughout the trip. He will speak to affiliates at the five-star Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Amman, Jordan, on March 11. Two days later, Bacow will attend a similar event at the Carlton Hotel in Tel Aviv, Israel, before meeting with Palestinian alumni on March 16 at a restaurant in Ramallah, a city in the West Bank.
A Harvard spokesperson confirmed Bacow’s travel plans in a statement on Thursday. In addition to meeting with Harvard alumni, Bacow will visit a number of universities and meet with higher education leaders at each stop, according to the spokesperson.
In particular, Bacow will visit the University of Haifa and tour its new downtown campus during his time in Israel, according to the spokesperson.
The University of Haifa awarded Bacow an honorary degree two years ago in a ceremony that took place virtually due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In Haifa, Bacow will meet with university affiliates in-person, the spokesperson confirmed.
Bacow’s trip initially included a stop in Istanbul, Turkey, to meet with Harvard alumni and higher education leaders, but Bacow canceled the trip in consideration of the country’s continued efforts to recover from several recent earthquakes, according to the spokesperson.
Bacow drew criticism from Harvard affiliates last month because, at the time, he had not issued a public statement about the earthquakes, which left more than 50,000 people dead in Turkey and Syria. More than 650 Harvard affiliates signed an open letter addressed to Bacow that called on the University to raise awareness about the crisis.
On Feb. 15, one day after The Crimson reported on the open letter, Bacow sent a note to Cemal Kafadar — the director of Harvard’s Center for Middle Eastern Studies — to express his “utter disbelief” at the devastation caused by the earthquakes.
“Though words fall short at a moment such as this, I want to offer my deepest condolences to you and your colleagues and students — and to all of your loved ones,” Bacow wrote.
Bacow’s trip to the Middle East comes two months after Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf faced backlash for allegedly denying former Human Rights Watch head Kenneth Roth a fellowship at the school over his criticism of Israel. Elmendorf later reversed his decision and apologized, a move Bacow praised.
Undergraduates had mixed reactions to Bacow’s Middle East trip.
Shraddha Joshi ’24, a spokesperson for the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee, wrote in a statement that the group expects Bacow to “performatively mention the importance of peace and dignity while denying the crime of apartheid on the ground.”
“After repeatedly calling on President Bacow and Harvard to disclose Harvard’s financial ties to companies that violate international law by operating within illegal settlements, and acknowledge the university’s complicity in violence against Palestinians, this trip only serves to exacerbate PSC and Palestinian students’ disillusionment with Harvard’s administration,” Joshi wrote.
The Harvard spokesperson declined to comment on the statement.
Harvard College Israel Trek — an annual subsidized spring break trip to Israel and the West Bank — coincides with Bacow’s trip this year, but participating students should not expect to see him. The PSC has led campaigns to boycott the trip for several years, alleging that it promotes an unbalanced perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The itineraries of the student trips to Israel and Palestine do not align with Bacow’s schedule, according to the Harvard spokesperson.
Harvard Hillel President Jacob M. Miller ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, wrote in an email Thursday that the group is “heartened to see” Bacow travel to Israel.
“We hope that Bacow’s visit to the country reveals the on-the-ground reality in Israel and inspires Bacow to counter students’ efforts to single out Israel as the only nation worthy of boycott,” Miller wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge School Climate Subcommittee in a Wednesday meeting reviewed a survey of the upper-school student populations, revealing a dramatic increase in mental health concerns and cases of discrimination experienced by students.
Fielded in May 2022, the anonymous and voluntary Teen and Middle Grades Health Survey saw responses from 1,282 high school students and 918 middle schoolers in the Cambridge Public School District.
The survey revealed that schools saw roughly triple the number of sixth to eighth grade students experiencing discrimination compared to the previous year. Students reported discrimination increased across multiple categories, including race, sexual orientation, faith, and gender identity.
Gender non-conforming students comprised the group facing the highest reported discrimination in both high schools and middle schools.
Kimberly Huffer, director of social emotional learning — a new position established in CPS this year — said it is crucial to recognize this trend in order to promote inclusivity in the district.
“This is important to us because it is one of our values within Cambridge Public Schools — our sense of belonging,” she said. “It’s one of our core values.”
The report also revealed sustained high rates of mental health issues within the student population. According to the survey, 27 percent of respondents said they struggle with their mental health “most of the time/always.” Huffer said this trend is a manifestation of continued impact from the “isolation of the pandemic” on students.
“Our students are still carrying a lot of worries and anxiety,” she said. “One of the biggest worries that our students are identifying is around school — so thinking about academic performance, life after high school, just kind of all those worries.”
Alongside anxieties related to school and academic life, the district identified depression and suicidal ideations as two major mental health concerns faced by the CPS student body. In order to address these concerns, the district is offering mental health support programs and providing suicide prevention training to its educators.
Along with professional training, the district said it is taking a “multi-tiered approach” to address the data, per the report. According to Huffer, initiatives placed in the first tier — which targets all students — focus on developing students’ “social emotional learning.” The district added it conducts biannual universal social emotional learning screening and includes curriculum focused on SEL in classes.
“While that isn’t necessarily mental health, we also know that social emotional learning skills can really help serve as a protective factor,” Huffer said.
Second-tier initiatives focus on providing early intervention to students in need, including individual and small group support in addition to timely mental health services in partnership with outside teletherapy counseling services, per the district.
“This is not just a CPS only kind of piece, but really working with the community and partnering with the community to make sure that there are resources for students and families,” Huffer said.
Michelle Madera, assistant superintendent for Cambridge public elementary schools, said while the results from the survey can be “pretty depressing,” it is important for the district to recognize the problems presented in the data and focus on improvement.
“We want to make sure that we use the data to inform our practices, our resources, and our supports to students,” she said. “I don’t want to lose sight of the purpose of this data and how we use it.”

Harvard’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Student Council discussed potential constitutional changes during monthly open meeting on Wednesday, spurring debate over potential issues of power consolidation and alleged lack of voting rights.
During a preliminary vote on the tentative language of the amendments at Wednesday’s meeting, the Council voted unanimously in favor of the proposed changes, excluding abstentions. The Council will vote upon and ratify the final changes in the April open meeting, according to GSC Vice President Jessica Chen.
The revisions include changing the chair of support, who is “responsible for allocating funds in both the conference grants as well as January@GSAS,” to a co-chair position overseen by the treasurer; allowing the president to appoint the Council’s adviser; making traveling scholars mandatory members who must pay the GSC student fee of $25; authorizing the parliamentarian to lead the Constitutional Revision Committee; and allowing committee chairs to appoint representatives as required.
During the meeting, participants also discussed the current lack of attendance of multiple program representatives.
“In the past, we’ve had a requirement for students to show up, which is why we had a lot more attendance,” GSC President Zachary Lim said. “One of the reasons why we removed the requirements was because we wanted people to come because they had something to share.”
In response to Lim, Aaron B. Benavidez, program representative for Sociology, said attendance was more “robust” before the Covid-19 pandemic.
“People were a bit more politically conscious, or at least, there was more fervor, more enthusiasm than maybe what we are experiencing now,” Benavidez said.
He also argued that allowing the president to appoint the adviser of the Council could consolidate power in the presidency.
“We can imagine a world where there’s a president this year, and then the president next year decides to appoint that person, even though that person might be unfavorable to GSC members,” Benavidez said. “We’re actually truncating political power even for people in the room.”
Meeting participants also discussed changes to the election process passed in October, including a move to an online platform. The new constitutional language excludes officers from voting, while continuing to allow all other elected members to cast a vote.
Benavidez said he believes the current system does not sufficiently address barriers to participation in student government.
“On one hand, we’re expanding fiscal responsibility to include all students including traveling scholars, while at the same time really not taking seriously this idea of universal enfranchisement and the right to vote for every student,” he said.
Sarah Y. Hoback, program representative for Physics and a first-year graduate student, said she prefers a system where all present participants can vote if the process to become an eligible voting member is highly competitive.
Benavidez said this method may present fairness issues due to “some barriers to attendance” in person, such as the distance between the Longwood campus and the main campus, as well as some members’ responsibility to care for young children.
Citing emails, posters, and social media — such as the GSAS Slack — Lim said the Council is actively trying to drive further engagement.
“I don’t think it would be a fair assessment, based on the work that we’ve done, that we’ve been trying to curtail any kind of participation,” he said.
Still, he said that many students possibly “don’t see enough things being done” to justify engagement with the Council.
“For many years, I think the GSC has failed to address certain needs that are very important,” Lim said.
Closing out the discussion on election policies, Lim further said that the current system has continued because “it’s just the easier thing to do.”
“We are already completely underwater, on a day-to-day basis,” he said. “And I don’t know if we have the capacity to revisit creating a whole new system.”

Cambridge’s Human Rights Commission discussed housing discrimination and ways to facilitate household participation in a Massachusetts rental assistance program to obtain housing in the city in a Thursday meeting.
The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program, introduced in Massachusetts in 1978 following the passage of a 1974 federal housing law, helps 20,000 households find apartments in Boston, Cambridge, and Brookline. In 2019, the three cities asked the federal government to allow them to vary housing payments by ZIP code, a change that has led to increased payments to households living in affluent areas.
Josh Stadlan, chair of the Human Rights Commission, said Section 8 program tenants are often denied housing due to credit score screenings — a barrier Human Rights Commission Attorney Investigator Carolina Almonte said the CHA is working to reduce.
“We are trying to look at alternative credit — guidance for landlords and property owners in Cambridge — because credit scores are used, in our view, way too often,” Almonte said. “It’s definitely a hurdle that folks face in terms of getting housing — voucher holders or not.”
“We are trying to encourage landlords to look at different metrics such as rental history, other bills that are paid on time — especially folks that are immigrants or just don’t have a credit history,” she added.
Almonte said the Cambridge Housing Authority receives a “high number” of complaints that landlords are denying housing to tenants participating in the Section 8 program.
“Sometimes we see that with just flat out, ‘I don’t want to accept Section 8, or I don’t know what Section 8 is,’” Almonte said. “Other times it’s using credit scores to say that someone’s not eligible for housing or just writing off folks based on their source of income.”
Still, Almonte said landlords in Cambridge “should be accepting Section 8.”
The meeting also addressed housing discrimination in the city, with the commission discussing a WBUR article published last December detailing racial discrimination by landlords.
Cambridge City Councilor Judith Laguerre recounted an anecdote of an immigrant couple from Somalia and Morocco who struggled to find affordable housing due to their skin color.
“And people are talking, ‘It’s ten years ago; it’s eight years ago,’” Laguerre said. “This is an example. It’s alive and well, and it’s not going away like this.”
During the meeting, the Human Rights Commission also discussed discrimination arising from the use of artificial intelligence in hiring practices and workplace settings.
“The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission put out in their new draft strategic enforcement plan — mentioned for the first time — that they are going to be looking into discrimination, employment discrimination that takes place over artificial intelligence or machine learning,” Stadlan said.
Commissioner Mercedes Evans said she opposes the use of software to screen for employee applicants, adding it would not remedy extant discrimination.
“I do think that one of the bigger questions is the baked-in discrimination that may show up because of who is actually doing the programming,” Evans said. “And there have been studies already that have shown that if you have a name that is ethnic — however they define that — then more often than not, that counts against you.”
“AI is probably not going to help it. But we do still have those other underlying kinds of prejudices that are going on and have gone on for some time,” Evans added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Massachusetts Representative Joe Kennedy III discussed the importance of expanding civic participation through grassroots organizing at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum Thursday evening.
The event, moderated by Boston Globe journalist Marcela E. García, also featured political strategist Tracey Lewis and NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson.
During the discussion, Johnson said collaboration between people from different regions of the country is important to find solutions to pressing issues.
“If you begin to put communities together — talk about mutual strategies and approaches — you can address systemic problems that are national in scope from a very local perspective,” he said.
“There’s real human consequences and repercussions from not being able to have that infrastructure in place, where people can build not just capacity but support and networks to take on challenges at a local level,” Kennedy added.
Kennedy, who serves as a member of the IOP’s Senior Advisory Committee, said both Republicans and Democrats do not build party infrastructure in many regions of the United States.
“There’s large sections of the country that Republicans don’t invest in, and Democrats don’t invest in; and the Democrat party has actually ignored the plains, the deep South, Appalachia,” Kennedy added.
Even in the “tried and true” blue state of Massachusetts with “robust Democratic infrastructure,” Kennedy said the party’s operation in the state often leaves many voters behind.
“It ends up, oftentimes, focused on turning out the folks that vote, and not so much focused on the places that don’t,” he said. “The consequence of that, with regards to political power — the political power gets concentrated in the places that do vote.”
During the event, Kennedy and Johnson also criticized the use of social media as an avenue for political outreach.
“Because the platforms profit off of hate speech and misinformation, it is causing a level of chaos in our democracy.” Johnson said. “It’s a powerful tool — in the wrong hands will and has caused harm.”
“Put people and faces behind bots and screens, then engage in conversation,” Kennedy added.
The panelists also gave advice to students attending the forum who aspire to engage in political activism and grassroots organizing.
“Harvard is an incredible place that will provide you extraordinary opportunity. It is also a bubble unlike any other place on the face of the planet,” Kennedy said. “The question is how do you take advantage of all that it offers in the time that you have here.”
“Don’t forget why you are here,” Johnson added. “The biggest change is you absorbing as much knowledge as possible.”
The event marked Kennedy’s first IOP appearance since his appointment as special envoy to Northern Ireland. The last remaining Kennedy family member serving on the IOP’s Senior Advisory Committee, he will continue his role at the IOP while working in the Biden administration.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel A. Cardona called on institutions to “stop worshiping at the false altar of U.S. News and World Report” during a conference hosted at Harvard Law School on Wednesday.
The event, jointly organized by Harvard Law School and Yale Law School, invited representatives from more than 100 law schools, 30 other institutions of higher education, and the U.S. Department of Education to discuss “best practices for law school data.”
The convention comes after top law schools, including at Harvard and Yale, opted to boycott the U.S. News rankings late last year, citing methodological concerns and potentially perverse incentives. The magazine announced in January that it would continue to rank Harvard and other boycotting schools in its 2023-2024 rankings using publicly available data from the American Bar Association.
In the conference’s keynote address, Cardona said inequities in higher education are perpetuated by ranking systems.
“Rankings discourage institutions with the largest endowments and greatest capacity to enroll and graduate more underserved students from doing so because it may hurt their selectivity,” he said. “Instead, the most life-changing higher education opportunities go to young people who already have every socioeconomic advantage.”
Citing similar departures of medical schools — including Harvard Medical School — from the U.S. News rankings, Cardona urged those in attendance to “tell your colleagues across higher education that they set the agenda, not some for-profit magazine.”
In an open letter to Cardona on Wednesday morning prior to his remarks, U.S. News wrote that Cardona should ask for “more data, not less” from school deans.
“U.S. News will continue to fight for access, transparency, and accountability of data that empowers students to make informed decisions,” the letter said. “You recently stated ‘As leaders, it’s time for us to stand up for students and expect more in education.’ We couldn’t agree more.”
In opening remarks, Yale Law School Dean Heather K. Gerken said she believes rankings “squeeze what cannot be measured into a system that has an impossibly wide range of institutions inside of it.”
During the first panel, Harvard Kennedy School professor Christopher N. Avery ’88 — who studies college ranking systems — emphasized the need for transparency during admissions processes, but he cautioned against replacing “one bad system” with “another system that may be bad in a wide variety of other ways.”
In another panel, Harvard Graduate School of Education Dean Bridget Terry Long ’97 spoke about the inherent difficulties in ranking schools.
“Even if we get some better measures of quality, let’s also just acknowledge, we’re not necessarily going to agree and all have the same definition of quality,” Long said.
Florida A&M University College of Law Dean Deidré A. Keller, who spoke at the conference, said in an interview that the event made her feel “hopeful and inspired.” Still, she said she believes it will be difficult for schools to move away from rankings.
“U.S. News and World Report has been ranking law schools since the 1990s, and so that’s 30-odd years of one system,” she said. “It will take, I think, a lot more work and collaboration to shift and alter that framework.”
In a statement after the event, Gerken expressed a desire for solutions that provide students with better access to data.
“We will build on the strong foundation provided by the American Bar Association reporting, an independent organization with deep expertise that has made available free, publicly available data on the issues that matter most to prospective students and our profession,” Gerken wrote.
U.S. Under Secretary of Education James R. Kvaal said in his remarks that attendees should “not lose sight of why the rankings are important.”
In an interview after the event, Kvaal said he believes there are ways to make current rankings more equitable and that the Education Department has reached out to U.S. News with suggestions for how to do so.
Kvaal also responded to the comments made by U.S. News in its open letter to Cardona.
“We welcome a conversation with U.S. News about how to best measure the value created by colleges and universities,” he said.

The former president of the Harvard Undergraduate Foreign Policy Initiative, just weeks after the conclusion of her term, transferred approximately $30,000 from the organization’s bank account to her own.
In the months since the Jan. 1 transfer, HUFPI has tried — and failed — to recover all the funds from its former president, Sama E.N. Kubba ’24. Communications obtained by The Crimson show that Kubba froze the club’s bank account, withheld access to social media accounts and the group’s website, and canceled travel arrangements without HUFPI’s approval.
Kubba has not responded to requests for comment on the current status of the funds. In a Jan. 9 email to HUFPI leaders obtained by The Crimson, she offered to return the money and social media accounts in exchange for more than $10,000 for “emotional distress and wrongdoing” and the club trips she was removed from following the dispute.
Over the past two months, The Crimson spoke with 10 current and former HUFPI members and reviewed more than 100 organization documents and emails, uncovering a pattern of internal conflict and financial misconduct around Kubba’s presidency.
As president, Kubba allegedly leveraged her control over HUFPI and its finances with little oversight, according to current and former club members. These sources allege Kubba took improper actions, including spending club funds for unauthorized personal use, threatening to freeze HUFPI funding during a summit, and refusing to aid in the transition of the club’s next leaders.
Kubba, who spoke to The Crimson regarding some of the allegations, said in a January interview that she transferred the funds to protect the HUFPI account from fraud. She also denied accusations of improper personal spending with a HUFPI credit card and said unauthorized transactions may be fraudulent. In an email to current HUFPI leadership on Jan. 7, Kubba claimed she canceled the travel arrangements accidentally.
Due to the sensitive nature of the dispute and sources’ concerns over possible disciplinary action, The Crimson has granted anonymity to several current and former members of HUFPI to discuss Kubba’s tenure and the fallout from her departure.
HUFPI declined to comment on specific allegations against the club or its former president.
“While the organization is unable to comment on any current investigations relating to the conduct of former members, HUFPI and its Board have taken the appropriate steps to strengthen financial security and promote a positive extracurricular culture,” HUFPI Co-Presidents Cosette T. Wu ’25 and Joyce Chen ’25 wrote in an email on behalf of the organization.
“The situation is still unresolved,” they added.
Since speaking to The Crimson on Jan. 11, Kubba subsequently sought to retract all on-the-record statements. She did not respond to later requests for comment regarding freezing HUFPI funding or refusing to cooperate with the club’s transition process.
“I’m gonna welcome anything that is needed to clear my name,” Kubba said in January. “I believe in what I did, and I believe that the intentions that I had for what I did were good.”
“I’ve spent too much on this organization to not act in its interests,” she added. “At the end of the day, I’m going to try to be an open book.”
Soon after Wu and Chen, Kubba’s successors, began their tenure, they found themselves locked out of HUFPI’s bank account and unable to control the group’s website or several of its social media accounts.
At the end of December, shortly after Kubba exited HUFPI’s presidency, she froze the club’s Bank of America account, according to internal documents obtained by The Crimson. HUFPI leaders were able to regain access to the account and subsequently changed the password.
But on Jan. 1, HUFPI received an email that there had been a modification to the club’s Bank of America user ID. Bank of America also sent emails to HUFPI indicating its bank account’s password had been reset and the senior director of finance’s debit card had been locked.
That day, approximately $30,000 was transferred from the HUFPI bank account into an account under Kubba’s name, multiple financial records obtained by The Crimson show.
On Jan. 2, a report of “stolen U.S. currency valued at $29,996.00” was filed with the Harvard University Police Department. The address for the report is listed as the Student Organization Center at Hilles, a Dean of Students Office building that acts as a physical space for undergraduate clubs.
The report was later reclassified as “Assist Citizen,” before the case was later closed on Feb. 1.
Following the discovery of the missing funds, the club contacted Kubba and requested that she “renounce access to all HUFPI financial assets.”
“It has come to our attention that you have breached your duties to this organization, interfered with the activity of this organization, violated its rules and policies, and have apparently engaged in financial self-dealing,” reads a Jan. 4 email to Kubba, signed unanimously by the club’s executive committee.
HUFPI executives also allege they saw their access to the club’s LinkedIn and Instagram accounts revoked during the transition, according to internal communications obtained by The Crimson.
The club received notification on Jan. 1 that its Wix premium account — which hosted HUFPI’s public-facing website — had been canceled.
As of this article’s publishing, HUFPI’s website is offline and the club’s most recent Instagram post is dated Jan. 1.
In response to the executive committee’s email, Kubba wrote on Jan. 4 that she believed the account had been compromised and that changing the login information and transferring the funds was done in an effort to protect club funds.
“When the login information was changed without my knowledge, Bank of America notified me because I am the primary account holder and informed me they believed it was fraud,” Kubba wrote in a Jan. 4 reply to HUFPI leadership.
“The money remains untouched and safe, and it will be deposited in-person at our BoA appointment after Jan 20th once our account is secured from further fraud,” she added.
In a separate email on Jan. 4, HUFPI leadership notified Kubba that she would not be joining the club on upcoming trips to France, Costa Rica, and South Korea.
Three days later, Kubba said she planned to take a “new approach,” and froze the account again.
“I froze the funds of the HUFPI account until the handover of the BoA account officially happens,” wrote Kubba in a Jan. 7 email to HUFPI executives.
“Until the account is unlinked to my social security number, I locked our account,” Kubba wrote. “That way, no more purchases or transfers are happening until there is a handover, and my name is thereby protected.”
HUFPI leadership disputed this line of reasoning in an emailed statement to The Crimson Thursday.
“Sama has never ‘owned’ the Bank of America account. HUFPI’s bank account cannot be owned by any individual; it is a business account owned by the organization itself. As such, the account had no impact on her, her credit score, etc. Furthermore, Sama neither is nor ever was a guarantor on the BOA credit accounts,” Chen and Wu wrote on behalf of HUFPI.
“These facts were confirmed many times by Bank of America’s representative to HUFPI and relayed directly to Sama (by the Bank representative) at the time of account opening,” they added.
Kubba did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the statement.
In a Jan. 7 email to the executive committee, Kubba defended her actions.
“I was not going to sit by and wait for a disaster to happen, especially knowing the problems with past financial management,” Kubba wrote. “With no communication, and the bank account still under my name, I took the steps I thought were necessary to protect myself, without in any way preventing the organization from continuing to work as normal.”
Kubba told The Crimson in January that she was advised by a “lawyer friend” to promptly return the money to HUFPI.
On Jan. 8, Kubba attempted to transfer $26,496 to a HUFPI account through PayPal. She also transferred $3,500 to the club via Zelle. However, the PayPal transfer was later reversed.
Around this same time, Kubba discovered that roughly $15,000 was frozen in her personal bank account, leaving it in the negative.
On Jan. 9, Kubba emailed HUFPI leadership to request roughly $5,600 in compensation for the three HUFPI-funded international trips that she had been barred from. She also requested $5,000 for “distress caused by the false police report and dramatic cut from the trips without a fair trial.”
In emails obtained by The Crimson, HUFPI leadership responded by suggesting mediation through the Harvard Ombuds Office. In addition, the two parties emailed to understand the $15,000 hold against Kubba’s account. HUFPI claimed it was not responsible for the freeze.
On Jan. 21, Kubba appeared to attempt to negotiate a resolution with HUFPI.
“This is my proposal to move us forward to a resolution: compensation for the trips I was removed from in exchange for the social media accounts and the money that Paypal returned to me,” Kubba wrote. “The requested compensation amount is $10,613.36, but I am willing to negotiate.”
As of Thursday, the situation is still “unresolved” according to a statement by Wu and Chen on behalf of HUFPI.
Internal communications obtained by The Crimson show that Kubba canceled the club’s flights to Costa Rica, incurring a large cancellation fee. Kubba claimed she had intended only to cancel her own ticket but canceled the group order by mistake.
“That was an accident, and I didn’t realize until I saw the email confirmation,” Kubba wrote in a Jan. 9 email to HUFPI executives. “I will not be paying up the difference, nor am I ‘liable’ to do so.”
HUFPI got its start like any Harvard club — with a niche.
Sahil S. Lauji ’21 said he noticed a dearth of foreign policy opportunities at Harvard and decided to start an organization where undergraduates could research policy projects with professionals.
In spring 2020 — HUFPI’s first semester — the organization consisted of several dozen members working on six policy projects. By its second semester, HUFPI had ballooned in size to surpass 100 members working across as many as 20 policy projects, according to Lauji.
Lauji left the group with the idea to host a conference to expand the club’s work to high school students — a program that became the Harvard Undergraduate International Relations Scholars Program.
Kubba, whom HUFPI’s website credited as the conference’s founder, said the impetus to create the Scholars Program was also based on the club’s bottom line. In spring 2021, according to Kubba, HUFPI had “barely enough to pay for the website.”
The 615 students who were accepted to the inaugural conference, which took place virtually in summer 2021, heard keynote presentations from foreign policy titans including former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger ’50, Blackstone CEO Stephen A. Schwarzman, and former U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta.
Attendees interviewed by The Crimson said the conference delivered on its mission of teaching high school students about foreign policy.
Scholars Program alumni Kaushik Pardeshi said the conference was “totally worth it” and lauded its “informative, novel, and interesting” programming.
The conference also delivered on its fundraising mission.
Though the program distributed scholarships, participants paid as much as $450 to attend the inaugural conference, with fees jumping to $750 the following year. According to a May 2022 email Kubba sent to club leadership obtained by The Crimson, the first high school conference earned the club roughly $188,000.
Still, budgets of this size — or larger — are not unheard of among Harvard student organizations.
According to public tax filings, undergraduate-run groups such as the Harvard College Association for U.S.-China Relations and Harvard Student Agencies have boasted annual revenue figures in excess of $100,000.
Unlike HUFPI, these clubs have alumni advisory boards, composed of graduates who provide advice and oversight to the groups.
HUFPI’s newfound revenue from conferences enabled the club to expand, providing members with the opportunity to travel domestically and internationally to advise some of the world’s most powerful foreign policy players.
The organization also invested some of its funding into internal club perks.
Documents obtained by The Crimson show the club purchased a corgi in 2021. HUFPI’s website referred to the dog, named Smoky, as the club’s “Ambassador of Love” until fall 2022.
Internal budgets from 2021 and 2022 obtained by The Crimson list more than $4,000 in spending on the dog, including $50 for travel costs and “damages to a personal item” as well as four payments of approximately $300 each spent on “pet-sitting” and dog care supplies.
Kubba said College administrators cautioned HUFPI against continuing to spend funds on the dog, and the club subsequently placed Smoky in the care of a HUFPI alumnus.
College spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman declined to comment on HUFPI spending on Smoky.
Kubba joined HUFPI as a policy researcher during her freshman year in fall 2020. By the end of the academic year, she had ascended to the club’s vice presidency, playing significant roles in club operations and policy research.
In December 2021, Kubba became HUFPI’s president.
As president, Kubba initiated HUFPI’s first Women in Foreign Policy Conference, which featured remarks from Secretary of State Antony Blinken ’84, a former Crimson editor.
In an internal email sent on Dec. 10, 2022, Kubba described her work to launch new diversity initiatives and organize a board retreat. Kubba also discussed launching a new stipend program for board members, which she described as “compensation for their time” in the email.
Three sources familiar with the program said the club paid stipends to deputy and senior directors in the organization for the fall 2022 semester. The stipends, which included a base amount and a bonus, totaled as much as $250 dollars for senior members — including Kubba.
The amount of the bonus depended on criteria that included board meeting attendance, according to three sources familiar with the program and internal emails obtained by The Crimson.
“Members must attend at least 50% of board meetings in the summer and fall or the President going to have a commitment meeting with them and their compensation is at stake,” an October 2022 email from a senior director reads.
Another email conveys members’ compensation was based on their use of ClickUp, a project management site. “Use clickup if you want a stipend bonus this semester,” Kubba wrote in an August 2022 email to the HUFPI board.
A 2022-2023 budget document obtained by The Crimson suggests Kubba originally advocated for performance-based bonuses, but the idea was opposed by the club’s finance team, who cited the difficulty of objectively measuring performance.
“i only want outstanding people earning--its not a [bonus] if everyone gets it,” Kubba wrote in the sheet. “not everyone deserves it.”
This practice was likely in violation of the guidelines set forth by the Dean of Students Office, a Harvard College body that oversees undergraduate social life and activities.
A 2022-2023 resource guide published by the DSO states that “no earnings of an undergraduate organization may accrue to individual members” without approval — which Associate Dean for Student Engagement Jason R. Meier said was more of a formality.
“Harvard College treats our student organizations as independent entities and organizations are therefore free to conduct business as it best behooves them,” Meier said. “We would not intervene in that.”
In a January interview, Kubba said the payments were meant to compensate low-income members for their work, and members were forbidden from using the stipends for certain purchases, such as alcohol.
“We were basically just trying to compensate people fairly for a lot of the work they put in,” Kubba said. “We basically categorize those as financial hardship scholarships.”
Other clubs — including the Harvard College Consulting Group and The Harvard Crimson — pay some members through need-based financial aid programs, but these stipends are typically monitored by alumni boards and not subject to discretionary withholding by student leaders.
Nicholas J. Brennan ’23, who served as senior finance director during the program, claimed the newly formed finance team was given “little influence” over the stipend program.
“At no point did the finance team either disburse stipends or have the power to formally amend the program,” Brennan wrote in a statement Thursday. “The stipend program was abolished shortly after the turn of the year.”
Kubba did not respond to a request for comment on this characterization.
Separate from stipends, some club executives also received credit cards linked to HUFPI accounts for paying club-related expenses. HUFPI accused Kubba in its Jan. 4 email of having improperly used her credit card during her tenure as president.
A list of the transactions on Kubba’s HUFPI credit card obtained by The Crimson includes $275 in expenses accrued at hair and nail salons, with one transaction taking place in Virginia Beach — Kubba’s hometown.
The transactions list also shows more than $1,200 spent in a single day in May at an upscale French department store, while HUFPI was in Paris for a foreign policy trip.
Kubba did not comment on the specific transactions, but she denied improper use of her HUFPI credit card and suggested there may have been fraudulent purchases made on the card in a January interview.
“If I get more clarification, I’m happy to either explain what the charge is and how it related to HUFPI, or probably label it as fraud — something that needs to be reported to the bank and not to me,” Kubba said.
In June 2022, HUFPI ratified a new constitution authored by then-president Kubba, which gave expansive power to the club’s president.
Though it was previously ambiguous, the new document explicitly tasked the president of the organization with unilaterally appointing all senior directors — the highest-ranking officers in the club after the president and vice presidents.
The new constitution also granted the president veto power over all board votes, which could only be overridden by a subsequent unanimous board vote. Another provision of the constitution held that the club’s board is unable to hold votes in the absence of the president.
Another change gave the president the choice of whether or not to elect vice presidents. According to two sources with knowledge of the situation, Kubba originally served with two vice presidents before they both resigned simultaneously in March 2022.
Though several current and former HUFPI members described Kubba’s work ethic as impressive, Irati Egorho Diez ’25 — the club’s current senior director of speakers — said Kubba’s position as president gave her power over advancement within the organization.
“I think it became very clear to me early on upon joining HUFPI that a lot of positions and vertical movement within the organization was contingent on Sama and Sama’s opinion of you,” Egorho Diez said, though she added she felt delegations were chosen based on merit. “Particularly I felt this when it came to going out, positions, and travel opportunities.”
Kubba did not respond to a request for comment on her perceived power in the organization.
As her presidency came to a close, Kubba wrote a farewell email to the organization.
“This is an org that gave me the freedom to be me and chase my wildest dreams,” her email reads. “I never thought I would have this much autonomy to have a platform to government leaders and make so much money.”
On Dec. 10, 2022, Kubba appeared to prematurely leave her presidency, which was set to conclude at the end of the month.
“I’ll spend the next couple weeks getting our new Co-Presidents-elect set up, help as I can and transition them over, but I’m on my way out as the official head of the organization,” she wrote in the farewell address, with the subject line “bye.”
But as Kubba’s successors — Chen and Wu — began to take up leadership, Kubba abandoned an official transition amid a dispute over how to pay for a sudden change to travel plans. Chen and Wu wrote in a statement on behalf of HUFPI that they had offered to purchase tickets for members whose flights had been canceled with surplus club funds.
In response, Kubba texted the pair on Dec. 18 that she would not aid in their transition.
“Since you guys are making calls without me and have zero respect for what I have to say, you can transition yourselves,” Kubba wrote in a text, according to records obtained by The Crimson.
Kubba did not respond to a request for comment on Chen and Wu’s statement on the trip planning conflict.
Ten minutes later, Kubba also sent a message to the HUFPI directors group chat communicating that she would be departing from her presidency early.
“There is no reason for me to stick around longer,” she wrote shortly before leaving the group chat. “No one cares what I have to say and I have repeated felt disrespected and like my work has meant nothing.”
Internal communications obtained by The Crimson show that Kubba denied attempts by the new co-presidents to facilitate an official transition, including leaving a group chat in which Chen and Wu requested access to club bank accounts.
Still, Kubba was set to attend policy and summit trips with HUFPI that she had helped plan, such as a January summit co-hosted with the Sciences Po Policy Project — or SP3 — a student-run policy organization based at the Paris Institute of Political Studies.
In text messages obtained by The Crimson, Kubba created a group chat on Dec. 29 with Chen, Wu, and SP3 organizers to sort out what she called “a misunderstanding on the schedule,” appearing to take issue with the fact that she was set to speak after Chen.
“And this conference is funded by Harvard,” Kubba wrote. “We should be speaking first and I should be the one as I was the president who even CAME UP with the idea of fucking doing this shit.”
Kubba later created a separate group chat with Chen and Wu, where she told them she would not turn over HUFPI financial accounts and passwords until the schedule was changed.
“The bank account transfer nor any logins are happening until you fix the speech situation,” she wrote on Dec. 29. “I was promised and told one thing, deliver on it.”
Kubba wrote to the group chat with SP3 a few hours later, threatening to freeze funding to the summit over the speaking order. In texts, Kubba specifically questioned why she was slated to speak after SP3 President Louai Allani.
“Why do you get to speak twice Louai and why do you speak before me?” Kubba wrote in a string of texts obtained by The Crimson. “You bid to OUR program. Scratch that you bid to MY program.”
“The money in HUFPI is still under my name and I have no issue resolving this by freezing funding if you can’t honor me as your equal Louai,” she added.
Allani and other members of SP3 leadership did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
The next day, Kubba wrote to the conference planning group chat that she should also be able to moderate discussions with former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, a keynote speaker at the summit.
“I’ll remind you all that freezing funds is within my capacity,” Kubba added. “Takes me 2 mins.”
Emails between Kubba and HUFPI executives suggest Harvard administrators hesitated to directly involve themselves in the dispute over the nearly $30,000 transfer, instead proposing the two parties resolve their conflicts through the Harvard Ombuds Office.
The approach aligns with the College’s historically hands-off policy toward club finances, which it has maintained even following significant financial misdeeds.
In 1994, two Harvard undergrads were indicted after they stole more than $130,000 from a school-sponsored fundraiser to benefit cancer patients. One year later, a student was charged with pocketing more than $7,500 from the Currier House Committee.
“We’re not planning to change our policy if we can possibly avoid it,” then-Harvard College Dean Harry R. Lewis ’68 said after the cancer charity scandal. “The autonomy of the student organizations can be maintained.”
Administrators took a similar stance following the embezzlement of roughly $100,000 from the Hasty Pudding Theatricals in 2002, under the rationale that stringent monitoring would not prevent similar misconduct.
DSO administrator Meier said in a January interview that the body’s policies are intended to protect students from legal and reputational harm. They are not necessarily meant to be enforced by the DSO, which describes its staff as mediators or guides for student organizations rather than enforcers, Meier added.
“We’re really trying to help our students not to get into something that they can’t handle,” Meier said. “You can find yourself and your name in some significant challenges, and we really are doing this to protect the individuals and to help make it an easier process for them.”
Kubba described a “mental health crisis” following the initial accusation of financial misconduct she received from the HUFPI executive committee.
“My heart is broken after this,” Kubba wrote in a Jan. 7 email to HUFPI leadership. “I am broken after this.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s baseball team opened the 2023 season with a series loss against the University of Pittsburgh last weekend in Port Charlotte, Fla., dropping three of its four games. The Florida sun, however, did not help the Crimson not shake off its Cambridge frost as it was overpowered by the Panthers during the series.
The series saw the Crimson play its first competitive baseball games since the end of Ivy League play last year, more than nine months ago. In an interview last week before the series against Pittsburgh, Coach Bill Decker said the team was “just itching to get going.”
Harvard lost a heartbreaker on Opening Day, entering the bottom of the ninth with a two-run lead before allowing a walk-off grand slam to drop the game 12-10. During the first game of a Saturday doubleheader, the Crimson got some revenge by staging an impressive come-from-behind win in the ninth inning to shock the Panthers and win its first game of the season 8-4. Harvard had less luck in game two on Saturday, losing 11-3 in seven innings, and on Sunday, the Panthers sealed their series victory over the Crimson with a 17-7 win.
The Crimson, which was ranked fourth in the Ivy League in a preseason poll, has a long way to go before it opens Ivy League play against the University of Pennsylvania later this month.
Decker, however, said he is not paying attention to any preseason polls.
“We want to do the best we can, obviously, in every series, and our goal is to get into that initial four-team tournament,” he said. “That’s it. We want to be one of the top four at the end of the year, and then we get a chance.”
PITTSBURGH 12, HARVARD 10
Harvard wasted no time scoring its first run of the season during the first game of the series on Friday. Junior outfielder Peter Messervy led off the first inning with a single to center field and quickly advanced to second base on another single by senior first baseman Logan Bravo. The next batter, junior third baseman Jake Berger, hit the third single of the inning down the right field line to score Messervy. The Crimson could not extend its lead in the opening frame, stranding two runners on base.
Junior right-hander Jay Driver took the mound for the Crimson on Opening Day, starting off his season with a six pitch walk. Driver quickly rebounded, getting the next two batters to strike out and fly out, but could not get out of the inning. Driver walked his second batter of the inning to put runners on first and second with two outs, before allowing a run scoring single to tie the game. A throwing error by Messervy allowed another run to cross the plate, leaving the Crimson down 2-1 after the first inning.
Harvard kept pressuring the Panthers in the top of the second, loading the bases with two singles and a walk and only one out. Junior right-fielder Ben Rounds then reached base on a throwing error by Pittsburgh’s shortstop, scoring two runs and allowing the Crimson to regain the lead. After a walk by Bravo to reload the bases, the Crimson extended its lead with some more help from the opposing team. The Panthers’ shortstop committed his second error of the inning, dropping a fly ball and allowing two more Crimson runs to cross the plate to extend Harvard’s lead 5-2. The top of the second ended after Bravo was tagged out in an attempted steal of home plate.
The Panthers managed to load the bases in the bottom of the second inning, but they only managed to squeeze out a single run after Driver allowed a walk with the bases full. Driver escaped the inning without allowing any more runs by getting Pittsburgh senior designated-hitter Jack Anderson to strike out swinging and strand three runners on base.
The Crimson added a run in the top of the third inning after junior left-fielder Chris Snopek and sophomore catcher Sawyer Feller hit back-to-back singles to start the inning. Driver allowed two runners to get on base in the bottom half of the third inning, but induced a fly out to end the inning to avoid any damage.
Driver started the bottom half of the fourth inning by getting a quick out on a ground ball that was hit directly to Bravo at first base, but then allowed back-to-back walks to end his first start of the season, with Decker bringing in senior right-hander James Kirkpatrick to pitch in relief. Kirkpatrick struck out the first batter he faced on three pitches, but then he gave up back-to-back singles which scored the two runners Kirkpatrick inherited from Driver. Kirkpatrick stranded the bases loaded to avoid giving up any more runs and keep the Crimson in the lead with a narrow 6-5 lead after four innings.
The Panthers added two runs in the bottom of the fifth inning and one more run in the bottom of the sixth inning while the Crimson was kept off the scoreboard, allowing Pittsburgh to take a 8-6 lead into the seventh inning.
The bottom half of the Crimson’s lineup fought back in the top of the seventh inning to regain the lead. With two men on base, senior shortstop Hunter Baldwin smacked an RBI double down the left-field line to score a run and put two runners in scoring position with only one out. The next batter, sophomore second baseman George Cooper, hit a single up the middle to score two runs and allow the Crimson to retake the lead 9-8. In the top of the eighth inning, Harvard added another run on an RBI double to extend their advantage over the Panthers to 10-8.
With a 10-8 lead going into the bottom of the ninth, Coach Decker brought in junior left-hander Uday Narottam to seal the victory for the Crimson. Narottam allowed a leadoff single, followed by back-to-back walks to load the bases with no outs. The next batter, Pittsburgh’s senior first baseman Noah Martinez, worked a 2-2 count against Narottam before smashing a walk-off grand slam to spoil Harvard’s Opening Day in Florida.
Driver ended his first start of the season with four strikeouts and only two hits over 3.1 innings. However, the junior struggled to find the strike zone during his outing, allowing seven walks and three earned runs. The Crimson’s best pitching performance came from senior left-hander Tim Williamson, who gave up just one run and one hit over four innings of work while recording three strikeouts. Narottam, who failed to record an out in the ninth inning, picked up the loss and was charged with four earned runs in his first appearance of the season.
Driver said in an interview after the game that he holds himself to a “higher standard.”
“I’m looking forward to getting back out there and improving upon what happened last time,” Driver said. “I gotta throw more strikes and be more efficient out there, so I can stay in the game for longer and put my team in a better position to win.”
HARVARD 8, PITTSBURGH 4
After the Crimson got shocked in the ninth inning on Friday, it flipped the script and did some shocking of its own in the ninth inning during the first game of a Saturday doubleheader. Game one was a pitcher’s duel until the Crimson’s bats came to life in the top of the ninth inning to score seven runs and secure its first of the season.
Junior right-hander Chris Clark shined for Harvard, as the Panthers could not hit the ball out of the infield in the bottom of the first inning. The Crimson’s offense made some noise in the top of the second inning. A leadoff walk and two singles loaded the bases with no outs, but Harvard only managed to score one run from a wild pitch. A walk by Messervy reloaded the bases, but the Panthers put an end to the Crimson threat by striking out Cooper and Bravo to hold Harvard to just a 1-0 lead.
Clark dominated throughout the first five innings, facing the minimum his first time through the Panthers’ lineup. In the second inning, Clark struck out the side on just 12 pitches. In the sixth inning, Clark gave up a walk to start the hitting and drilled the next batter he faced to put runners on first and second base with no outs. A throwing error by Berger, the Crimson’s third baseman, allowed the two runs to score. Clark managed to get out of the inning without further damage, but he exited the game with the Crimson down 2-1.
The score remained unchanged until the top of the ninth inning. With the Crimson just three outs away from losing their second game of the season, Rounds belted a solo home run to tie the game 2-2 and let the Crimson breathe a little easier. The next batter, Messervy, worked a full count before drawing a walk. After a strikeout by Cooper, the Crimson’s bats came alive: Bravo drove in Messervy with a double down the left-field line, Berger scored Bravo with an RBI single, and senior designated hitter Will Jacobsen extended the lead with an RBI double that brought home Berger and gave the Crimson a three-run lead. Harvard scored three more runs in the top of the ninth inning, batting around their lineup and increasing their lead to 8-2.
The Panthers attempted to stage another comeback in the bottom of the ninth, hitting three singles to start the inning and loading the bases with no outs. Senior lefthander Harrison Stovern, who pitched three innings in relief of Clark, got the next two batters to ground out, trading two runs for two valuable ninth inning outs. Stovern sealed the Crimson’s victory with his third ground out of the inning and picked up the win for his three innings of work in relief.
Clark did not earn the victory, but finished his first start of the season with 10 strikeouts over six innings of work. Clark only allowed two hits, two walks, and no earned runs in the Crimson’s strongest starting pitching performance of the weekend.
Driver, one of the Crimson’s co-captains, praised Clark’s performance in an interview after the four-games series. Driver said that Clark “pitched really, really well” and was one of the team’s highlights over the weekend.
PITTSBURGH 11, HARVARD 3
After waking up for the ninth inning in game one, the Crimson’s bats went back to sleep during game two of the Saturday doubleheader. The Panthers outscored the Crimson 11-3 in a seven inning game to hand the Crimson its second loss of the series.
Sophomore right-hander Sean Matson started for the Crimson and he was rudely welcomed into the new season by the Panthers. Matson gave up a single to the first batter he faced, before allowing a two-run home run to the second Pittsburgh hitter of the game as the Crimson quickly found itself in a 2-0 hole after the first inning.
The Crimson had a chance to retake the lead in the second inning. Berger hit a leadoff double, Snopek walked, and Feller singled to load the bases. The Crimson was unable to go in front of the Panthers, only scoring one run on a fielder’s choice and leaving two runners stranded on base.
Harvard had to wait until the third inning to tie the game. Messervy hit a leadoff double down the left-field line and was quickly driven home after a double by Rounds. However, the Crimson continued to miss opportunities to jump in front, stranding another two runners on base at the end of the inning.
The Crimson would never get another chance to take the lead. The Panthers scored three runs in the third inning, knocking Matson out of the game after just 2.2 innings. Coach Decker brought junior right-hander Porter Jordheim into the game from the bullpen, but Jordheim immediately gave up an RBI single to the first batter he faced, allowing the one runner he inherited from Matson to score.
Jordheim struggled to record outs in the fourth inning as well, hitting a batter and giving up a walk, forcing Coach Decker to turn to his bullpen again. Decker brought in freshman right-hander Jack Smith to face Pittsburgh’s Martinez — who hit the walk-off grand slam in Friday’s game — with one out and two runners on base. Martinez smashed the third pitch he saw from Smith over the fence for a three-run home run that gave the Panthers an 8-2 lead over the Crimson.
The Panthers added two more runs in the bottom of the fifth inning and another run in the bottom of the sixth inning, while keeping the Crimson off the scoreboard until the top of the seventh inning. Harvardmanaged to get a couple of runners on base, but it was unable to jumpstart a come-from-behind rally in the final inning of the game, dropping their second game of the series to the Panthers.
PITTSBURGH 17, HARVARD 7
In the final matchup of the four-game series, the Crimson took an early 3-0 lead against the Panthers on Sunday. Rounds hit a double in the top of the first inning and quickly came around to score on an RBI single from Bravo. Berger drew a walk to put runners on first and second for Snopek, who hit an RBI double to drive in Bravo. Berger scored the third run of the inning after he raced home on a wild pitch.
Senior right-hander Will Jacobsen, who appeared earlier in the series as a designated hitter, started for the game for Harvard. Jacobsen retired the Panthers in order in the first inning, but ran into some trouble in the second inning. Pittsburgh loaded the bases against the Crimson, but Jacobsen induced an inning-ending double play to escape the jam and keep the Panthers off the scoreboard.
Jacobsen had less luck in the third inning, allowing two unearned runs after an error by Bravo allowed a runner to reach base and extend the inning. Harvard remained ahead, with a narrow 3-2 lead after three innings.
In the fourth inning, the Panthers burst open the floodgates and scored six runs against Jacobsen. After allowing a two-run RBI double, Jacobsen walked a pair of batters to load the bases. The next batter blasted a grand-slam to left center-field and increased the Panthers’ lead to 8-3, the second grand-slam surrendered by the Crimson’s pitching staff in the series.
The grand-slam knocked Jacobsen out of the game, forcing Coach Decker to turn to Narottam in relief. Narottam, who struggled in the first game of the series, successfully retired the Panthers to end the fourth inning.
In the fifth inning, Narottam’s struggles returned as he failed to record outs against the Pittsburgh batters. Narottam surrendered five hits, one walk, and hit one batter in the inning, getting charged with seven earned runs over a 1.1 total innings of work as the Panthers jumped out to a 15-3 lead over the Crimson. After his two appearances over the weekend, Narottam finished the series with a 74.25 ERA.
Harvard made some offensive noise in the top of the sixth inning, scoring four runs after home runs by junior catcher William Lybrook and freshman outfielder Max Lane, and an RBI single from sophomore outfielder Matt Giberti. However, it was not enough to threaten the Panthers’ lead, with the Crimson losing the final game of the series 17-7 in eight innings.
Driver said Harvard’ss pitching staff needs to improve its performance this weekend when it returns to Florida to face Florida International University in a four-game series starting on Friday.
“As a whole, the pitchers can do a better job, myself included — keeping runners off base, keeping the score down, putting up the zero,” Driver said.
Driver also said that the Crimson getting ranked fourth in the preseason poll of Ivy League baseball teams is “definitely something that we’re not happy with.”
“We believe that we’re better than that,” Driver added. “In the end of the day, it’s up to us to prove that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s lacrosse team took the field two weekends ago for its first game of the 2023 season in Charlottesville, Va., battling the Cavaliers of the University of Virginia. The first contest of the season did not prove to be fruitful for the Crimson in a 25-21 loss to the No. 1 ranked team in the country, coming out to a slow start that saw UVA jump out to a 9-0 lead in the first ten minutes of action.
The Cavaliers’ offense proved to be too dynamic for the Harvard defensive unit, taking advantage of small gaps given up by the defense both down on low attack and in transition. The UVA attackers and offensive-middies came out gunning for the ball. This started out with the team’s face off group, which did a solid job of winning the ball outright and completely shutting down Harvard offensive attempts when sophomore FOGO Andrew DeGennaro or first-year Matt Barraco were able to win the initial clamp. With this unequal possession time, UVA capitalized on their sets and took advantage of the Crimson’s defense, which came out a step slow. Virginia’s attackmen were especially successful shooting on the outside, using Harvard defenders as screens and preventing junior goalie Christian Barnard from reading the shots in the first quarter.
“Speaking defensively, we need to do a better job guarding guys straight up, and we have been working on that a lot this week. We have some of the best athletes in the country on our team and I can say with full confidence that we can keep up athletically with UVA and any other team,” first-year defender Charlie Muller noted. “With that being said, we have to master some off-ball things, and work on smaller things, but it all starts with on-ball guarding.”
Working on the small things and focusing on each and every play seemed to be the message head coach Gerry Byrne instilled in his players during halftime. Muller commented on this message and Byrne’s ability to rally his players to come out and play what looked like a completely different game in the second half.
“We had a really big improvement in the second half. Coach Byrne took us to the locker room and talked to us about how we were going to respond, and how we were going to react, and I think our second half proves that we are a team that won't quit, and that we have what it takes,” Muller stated. “We were caught off guard, and we made some mistakes that we have been working on throughout the week that should not have been made.”
First-year offensive-middie Teddy Malone commented on what the team needed to work on before its second game facing off against the Bucknell Bison, citing chemistry as the key to the Crimson’s future success. Before taking on UVA, the squad had only battled together for about three weeks.
“Something we’ve been working on is just our overall chemistry I’d say. Although we still have a majority of our team back, there are some new additions,” Malone said. “We’ve been concentrating on making sure everyone is on the same page, whether that be offense, defense, or the riding and clearing. Dissecting different schemes on film really helps us as a team.”
Film was definitely crucial in helping the team shape up for its second game against Bucknell, which proved to be a smoother fight for the team. The second regular-season battle took place on Saturday and marked the team’s home opener at Jordan Field, as both the men’s and women’s teams competed on the turf in honor of the One Love Foundation. This foundation is built on teaching young people about healthy relationships. It was founded in the memory of Yeardley Love, a former UVA lacrosse star who was tragically killed by her boyfriend. The teams dedicated their games to One Love.
On the field, the Crimson looked much more cohesive than in its first game. The first quarter saw Harvard jump to a 5-1 lead, ending the first quarter with the momentum of a four goal unanswered stretch. A theme throughout the game was man-up and man-down play: the Crimson saw six extra man opportunities and the Bison were man-up five times.
One extra-man opportunity defined the entirety of the game, however. A high-hit to the head saw Bucknell go man-down locked in for three minutes, and also caused a Bison player to be ejected for dangerous play. This hit halted action, and first-year LSM Sean Jordan was taken off the field in an ambulance. Coach Byrne has since tweeted that Jordan is doing well and is with his family out of the hospital, and gave insight into how he coached his players through the ordeal.
“Having had three children who played lacrosse, it is a parent’s worst nightmare to see their child on the ground and obviously you want to leave room for the experts to go there. Sean was alert and conscious and he was caring about the play and the game more than about himself,” Byrne praised. “So, as far as for the team, you can’t be thinking about revenge or being vengeful. You have to put your thoughts for your teammate in your heart and get on to the next play.”
According to senior middie and captain Nick Loring, the incident sparked intensity within the team to win for Jordan. He emphasized that they all agreed they wouldn’t get chippy, but that they would let their skill talk for them, and the team ended the second quarter ahead 9-3.
“It was a really tough moment seeing Sean go down and we are all thinking about him and praying for him. The mindset is that we are doing this for Sean now. We have to keep our heads and keep playing the same way we had, we had been playing really well up until that moment,” Loring said. “I was really proud of how the guys responded after that moment.”
Sophomore defenseman Martin Nelson spoke about what it was like playing both up and down a man. He noted that safety is the priority of the refs this season, and by calling the games tightly, there is a heightened need for a solid man down and man up unit.
“This season they are really focused on the high hits and protecting the players, which is obviously very good, but it’s leading to a lot more man-down situations, and so it is something that we have really focused on in practice,” Nelson said. “We are going to keep focusing on it, we just have to keep flying around out there and making plays.”
On the offensive end, play looked solid; the offensive unit had 54 shots, 27 of which were on goal, an indication that the team was creating motion on attack. Sophomore middie Owen Gaffney noted that despite the team’s win, there is always room to improve, especially going into this weekend’s battle against the University of Vermont, a scrappy team that plays Canadian-style crafty lacrosse.
“We did things really well as a team, but in terms of doing better, I think we want to work on improving everything,” Gaffney said. “Going into next week, getting one-percent better each day, and just going from there. Riding, clearing, offense, defense, there is always room to improve”
On the defensive end Nelson noted that compared to last week, the team looked a lot more solid, but that there are still areas that they hope to improve going forward.
“In particular, I think our rotation could continue to improve, but I think that we are getting there; and just clearing the ball once we get those opportunities to kill some possessions,” Nelson said. We communicated better, and I think that we were picking up inside guys and not freeing up on the slides while they had their hands free on the outside. Overall, I think that we played a lot better as a team defense.”
Byrne has high hopes for his squad, and is happy with the improvement his team made in practice between the UVA and Bucknell games.
“I think that we were better in nearly every area,” Byrne said. “We had better goaltending, we were better off the ground, we competed in the middle of the field much better than we did against Virginia, so I think it was a great opportunity for us to get back to the way that we play”
Despite this increased success on the field, Byrne is not resting on his laurels, and he is not underestimating the team’s next opponent.
“With Vermont, they have some Candaians on their team, they play a Canadian-style offense, and they are very skilled with stick-handling, and are very unbelievably well-coached too; they won their league the last two years and played in the NCAA tournament the last two years, so I expect them to be a challenge for us,” Byrne said.
The men’s lacrosse team returns to Jordan Field on Friday, March 3 at 4:30 p.m. against the University of Vermont. The action will also be streamed live on ESPN+.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard squash certainly has a decorated past – the team has a history of record-setting winning streaks, championing many Ivy League titles, and consistently taking home the College Squash Association (CSA) prize for the post-season success. And after what the Crimson squash program produced over the past two weekends of CSA team competition, Harvard also has a decorated present: both the men’s and women’s teams managed to overcome two very talented Trinity College squads to win the CSA team title for the fourth and eighth consecutive time, respectively.
The victory on the men's side comes as little surprise. This season, No. 1 Harvard (17-0, 6-0 Ivy) has been nothing but dominant, and the Crimson was a heavy favorite all year to win the Potter Cup. Nonetheless, when senior Marwan Tarek won the last point against his No. 6 Trinity College (17-5) opponent to seal the win for the Crimson, the George A. Kellner Squash Center in Hartford, C.T. erupted into cheers that made it seem as if Harvard had just completed the upset of the century.
The true underdogs in the match-up were the Trinity College Bantam. The route to the CSA finals forced the Bantam to make two impressive upsets. Even in the first match, the relatively low-seeded Trinity College team was pitted against a strong No. 3 Princeton (11-4) that had managed to take two individual matches off of the Crimson back in January.
Fuelled by a rowdy Hartford home crowd, the Bantam found them up four matches to one very quickly against the Tigers. From there, it was Trinity’s game to lose. After recovering from the shock of the first five matches, Princeton, an experienced team, would not go away that easily, as the Tigers rallied to take the next two. But ultimately, in the eight match of the day, the Bantam found  its fifth point for the win.
The narrative was similar, albeit more intense for the semifinal bout between Trinity and No. 2 University of Pennsylvania (16-3, 5-1 Ivy). Going into the tournament, the second ranked Quakers’ squad, which Harvard narrowly defeated in last year’s CSA finals in one of the decade’s most thrilling matches, was expected to give the Crimson another challenge for the Potter Cup. Penn had comfortably dispatched the Bantam in the regular season, and only took one loss, which was awarded in a duel against the Crimson, which saw Harvard prevail 5-4. If Penn emerged from the semi-final to play the Crimson again, it was bound to be a competitive game.
However, instead of pulling away from the Bantam after the first match win went to Penn, Trinity stayed within striking distance. With the points tied 4-4, and the Bantam holding the momentum, Harvard began to adjust its expected strategy to plan for a Crimson-Trinity College Potter Cup final.
Harvard’s side of the tournament bracket seemed to be a more solid path. In an expectedly easy victory, the Crimson defeated the No. 8 Cornell Big Red (8-9, 3-4 Ivy), posting almost exclusively sweeps. The battle set a good tone for Harvard’s CSA tournament campaign, with fundamentally solid play and well placed shots dropping in the Crimson’s favor.
The semifinals against the second Connecticut school in the tournament proved to be much more demanding. Harvard ultimately clinched the win against No. 4 Yale (11-4, 3-3 Ivy) after only six matches played; however, each of these matches was a true battle. Senior George Crowne had a particularly tough bout that lasted longer than 70 minutes, as he managed to oust his opponent in five games at the number two spot. Other notable performances came from senior Marwan Tarek and junior Ido Burstein, who were the only two Crimson to sweep their opponents. Worn and tired from the long clash with the Bulldogs, Harvard had to dig deep the next day in the CSA final.
Whether it was Harvard’s fatigue from the day before, or the eternal roar from the Trinity College supporters in the stands, the Potter Cup final saw the Bantam push the Crimson harder than it had been pushed before. Coming off the momentum of two upset wins against top-three teams, Trinity College came into the match with nothing to lose, looking to complete the upset. Harvard fell behind 0-2 after the first two games until great play by sophomore Tate Harms, who  posted an incredibly solid tournament, put the Crimson on the board.
Follow-up wins from Burstein — who was last year’s Potter Cup hero in the ninth-match thriller against Penn — and first-year Denis Gilevskiy placed Harvard within one victory of claiming the crown.
In perhaps the most appropriate exit from college team-squash, it was the Crimson co-captain Tarek who posted the final and deciding win to send Harvard home to Cambridge with another trophy. Trading the first two sets with his Bantam opponent Mohamad Sharaf, Tarek dug deep to find composure in a squash facility ready to explode with noise. Claiming a crucial game three, the Cairo native carried his momentum to take over in his fourth and final game of the tournament; up 10-5, Tarek hit a stinging, rising backhand forcing his opponent Sharaf to take a risky overhand spike. And as the tinny sound of the ball hitting the out-of-bounds runner tapered out, a new sound of celebration echoed from the whole Crimson team, who had been standing holding their breath for the final point.
The players flooded the court and piled on to Tarek, celebrating their collective success. This marked the fourth consecutive year that Harvard raised the Potter Cup as national champions of the college squash circuit. Crowne and Tarek played a key role in the Crimson’s wins this season, and the two athletes will leave spaces on the roster tough to fill. However, with a rather young lineup — retaining seven out of nine players — Harvard men's squash will certainly be a team to watch next year as it will look to continue its dynasty.
In the women's side of the CSA tournament, the Bantam also played the foe to the Crimson. Earlier this year, No. 1 Trinity College (18-1) defeated No. 2 Harvard (14-1, 6-0 Ivy) to break Harvard’s 102-match winning streak. Though the Crimson responded to this loss in the second half of the season, winning the Ivy League title, its prospects at the CSA title were still uncertain.
As soon as the CSA tournament weekend began, it seemed fated for these two squash giants to meet again in the finals. On day one, Harvard and Trinity College cleared their opponents from the quarterfinals comfortably. While both matches were tougher, the Crimson and the Bantam both made it out of the semifinals relatively unscathed. The greatly anticipated match-up had come into fruition: it was Harvard’s chance at redemption and Trinity’s chance to finally take the throne once and for all.
“We went in as the second seed and knew that all three matches of the weekend would be challenging. Getting to face Trinity again in the finals was the perfect opportunity for us to avenge our regular season loss,” explained sophomore Brecon Welch on the second chance opportunity to play the top team in a CSA final. “We were definitely excited to play and had the mindset that we wouldn’t come off the court unless we had given everything we had.”
This drive to win seemed to be on display from the beginning. Welch put the Crimson on the scoresheet with a hard fought victory over the Bantam’s Lujan Palacios. Welch, who had fallen to Palacios in the regular season in five games, saw herself in a similar situation again, down two to one heading into a fourth set. This time around, though, Welch found the upper hand. The second-year from Greenwich, C.T. played some of her best squash all season when it mattered most.
“After that [regular season] match [against Trinity College] each and every one of us took it upon ourselves to train hard and look after our bodies so that we could put ourselves in the best spot come Nationals,” Welch stated.
Though sometimes settling for safer shots, Welch was able to keep incredible composure in high-stakes points, outlasting her opponent with endurance and consistent pressure. She secured a close fourth game 11-9, and with the same energy as if playing the first match of the tournament, powered through the fifth, taking it 11-3 and getting Harvard its first point.
First-year Saran Gregory-Nghiem, who has had an impressive rookie season with the Crimson playing at the number two spot, grabbed another point, also winning in a tense five-game match. Harvard’s number three, sophomore Habiba Eldafrawy, added to the Crimson hot-streak, winning her match in straight games, only conceding 16 points. This victory for Eldafrawy marked her twelfth individual win of the season, a Crimson best.
With Harvard on a roll, the Bantam was forced to respond, taking two more games from Harvard. As the dust settled in the Penn Squash Center, though, the scoreboard showed that the Crimson had four points, and Trinity College only had two.
Left to play was junior Marina Stefanoni, taking on Trinity College’s Jana Safy. Stefanoni won the pair’s last encounter, and looked to repeat to clinch the championship for the Crimson. Stefanoni applied continuous pressure to her opponent, taking an early lead. Safy put up a strong fight, making the Harvard number one earn each point. But eventually, the moment came for Stefanoni and the Crimson. Up 10-9 in the third game with the match and the championship on the line, locked in an intense duel along the right wall, Stefanoni made a fake shot left, drew her opponent off balance, and forced an error. The entire Harvard team, that had been watching behind the back glass, burst into cheer. It was evident that this win was important for the entire program.
“Squash is an individual sport but this couldn’t have been more for a team win. Whether it was playing, coaching, or cheering, we all fed off each other’s energy,” said Welch of the winning moment. “It was really amazing to see all of our hard work pay off.”
The Crimson has been putting in immense work in its squash program. Directed by Ivy League Coach of the Year, Mike Way, Harvard squash has been at the top of the league for years. The victory this season marks the eighth straight Howe Cup victory for the women's program. Winning the CSA title in a season that called for perseverance demonstrates better than any just how strong this Crimson squad is, and how strong it will continue to be in the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Princeton (20-5 overall, 11-2 Ivy League) reasserted its dominance after a 10-point Harvard (15-10, 8-5 Ivy League) lead vanished on Friday night at Princeton’s Jadwin Gym. The Tigers thundered back to beat Harvard 51-47 for a senior night win.
“Our team did a great job of focusing on only ourselves, and not everyone else in that gym,” first-year forward Katie Krupa said.
With this focus on playing above the buzz mounting in the arena, the Crimson took the floor ready to play and came out firing on all cylinders. It scored off the tip and earned a stop on Princeton’s first possession. The team shot 50% from the field in the first frame, and by the end of the quarter, Harvard held the lead, 14-12.
Its play in quarter two continued to display both the Crimson’s depth and defensive prowess. Five players — sophomores Elena Rodriguez and Harmoni Turner, senior McKenzie Forbes, and freshmen Saniyah Glenn-Bello and Krupa — provided the scoring.
On the defensive end, Princeton only mustered eight points across the ten minutes. All eight were scored by one player: Kaitlyn Chen.
Chen proved the spark plug for the Tigers all game, netting 18 points and bringing intensity and toughness for 35 minutes. Her quickness off the dribble and creative cuts through the lane were all but unstoppable from the tip to the last buzzer.
“That's what fuels us every single game,” said Chen regarding her squad’s team defense.
Princeton seniors Grace Stone, Julia Cunningham, and Ellie Mitchell consistently backed Chen up with strong play and good looks at the hoop.
Stone stepped up with seven points to launch her team to a 15-9 third-quarter run, a momentum shift that proved fatal for the Crimson.
“We had control of the game for the first 37 minutes of the game,” Krupa said. “The last three minutes got away from us.”
Harvard was rattled down the stretch, and their shot selection and percentage suffered as a result. It netted only 27% from the field for the final quarter; when Chen tied the game with a jumper with 2:15 remaining, the Crimson had no answer.
On paper, the matchup did not necessarily promise a thriller. Princeton was riding eleven straight wins, playing on their home floor in front of 1700 fans, and sitting pretty atop the Ivy League standings. Nonetheless, the Crimson took the floor with palpable pride and enthusiasm, buoyed by its previous showdown with the Tigers on New Year's Eve in Lavietes Pavilion.
In that first matchup of the season with Princeton, Harvard pulled off an extraordinary upset of the Ivy League powerhouse. The Tigers had put together a string of seasons that left the loss column practically empty, but the Crimson snapped their streak of 42 straight conference wins. It was an exciting start to the first season under head coach Carrie Moore, who worked as a part of the Princeton coaching staff as recently as 2019. Moore has led Harvard to a solid 8-3 record in conference play, improving on last season’s seven regular season Ivy League wins.
“Coach always says we have inches…we are just inches away and we need to make those strides,” Krupa commented.
Harvard won’t have to wait much longer to stride toward a rebound. They will host Dartmouth (2-25, 0-13) this Saturday at 4:00 p.m. The team will celebrate its seniors as they take the floor in Lavietes Pavilion one last time.
Harvard will start its Ivy Madness tournament run on Friday, March 10 at Jadwin Gym.

You might have looked at the title and my graduation year and thought, “What does she know about Housing Day?” Honestly, not much. But I can say that Annenberg in the days leading up to the grand event provides an ocean of information. Some people want Adams (Insomnia Cookies?!), some want Eliot (hello, in-suite bathrooms!), and some are just going to go with the flow (liars). As an independent observer with no stake in this at all (it could make or break my college experience), I can almost guarantee that there will be some absurd reactions and some fascinating strategies. From a fellow first-year, here’s a rundown of seven types of first-years you’ll find on Housing Day:
Did River Run and it worked
You will go to your grave swearing that River Run works if you do it right. Sure, everybody says it’s random, and sure, there’s literally no evidence suggesting otherwise, but you were extra special and you really did it right. To all the people who did River Run and got Quadded, are you sure you took every shot? Did you leave any drops of cheap vodka on the rim of the glass? Whisper the magic words? Either way, you get to tell everyone that luck (and the River Run gods) were on your side.
Did River Run and got Quadded
You probably feel like the world hates you. You took so many shots at so many houses (no one needs to know why there’s puke in the grass outside Eliot) and it was all for good luck — all to increase your odds of being that much closer to Felipe’s. But now you’re rocking the worst hangover of your life, and in a couple hours you’ll have to trek over to the Quad and eat dinner there. But then you realize, maybe you’re just being dramatic. People love the Quad, for the community, for the vibes. And hey, you’ll come to love it too.
Just happy to have a blocking group
February was a tough month for you. Your roommates all blocked with each other and some other kid (“We didn’t do it on purpose, we just all know her from a separate mutual acquaintance!”). You were going to block with your girlfriend, but she dumped you on the 13th. Somehow though, you all-mighty hero, you managed to scrounge up a pset buddy and the kid you see in the bathroom every Saturday night when you’re both drunk and can’t find the toilet. This was an act of God. So, when six juniors burst into your room on Housing Day you don’t even care what they’re screaming. Pfoho? Quincy? Adams? Doesn’t matter – at least you’re not going alone.
Has a midterm in an hour
“Winthrop!” “Leverett!” “Cabot!” “LS50!” Oh no. You’ve got about 27.5 more minutes of celebrating and then it’s off to Cabot Library to fake-study for a midterm you’ve had three weeks to prepare for. Will you sit there and make a list of all the things you won’t learn in the next hour-and-a-half instead of actually studying? Maybe. Will you stare longingly at the Yard and wish you’d just studied yesterday like your blockmates told you? Probably. But hey, at least after your midterm, you can celebrate with a tour and dinner at your new house!
Still Asleep
Look, we get it, it happens to the best of us. Just last week, I slept through my 9 a.m. (aka I woke up an hour before and turned off all my alarms). Unfortunately, you just happened to sleep through one of the most exciting days of the year. Don’t worry though, if the first couple knocks from upperclassmen lathered in body paint and not enough clothes don’t rouse you, they will break down the door and yank you out of bed themselves (probably? I’m a first-year, I don’t know). This is an unofficial official reminder to set your alarm. Heck, set multiple alarms. It’s Housing Day. Get up.
Already hates their blocking group
You’re out in the Yard and you’re already trying to convince everyone that your new house is the best house, but… hold on. Where are your future roommates? Oh god, one of them is trying and failing to climb onto the John Harvard statue, fighting for the perfect spot to get on Dean Khurana’s Instagram feature. Another is screaming in your ear for no apparent reason. Where’s number four? Gotcha. He’s already inviting a girl over and… wait, is he wearing your favorite sweatshirt? Oh no. What have you done?
The Vlogger
People look down on your camera hugging, ring-lit ways, but you swear it’s just because they’re jealous. The poor Dunkin’s manager unlocked the doors at 5 a.m. and there you were, video camera in one hand and notes app open with a list of coffee orders in the other (please tip him, no one should have to make eight oat milk matcha lattes at 5 a.m.). In a few hours, when you and your blockmates are all crammed into one room for dorm storm, your dearest friends will cheer and celebrate and hug. But where are you? By the window sill, recording the moment for the “Day in my Life: Harvard Housing Day Edition” video you’ll upload onto YouTube in a couple hours. Like and Subscribe!
I’ve heard a lot of excuses in my life. I panicked! It all happened so fast! I got caught up in the moment! People seem to think that exciting, overwhelming times can make you do things you’d never do otherwise. Unfortunately for the worst behaved among you, I’m inclined to think that Housing Day brings out our truest selves. Whether you’re crying, passing out, or holding on to that camera for dear life, March 9 should be the day you let loose. If the upperclassmen can do it (see: spandex blue shorts and Lowell body paint), why can’t we?

It’s Thursday, March 9, around 8 a.m. You and your blockmates are nervously and not-so-patiently sitting in your dorm, staring out of your window trying to identify and spot the group of students rushing towards you, and waiting for the fateful knock at your door. You are sleep deprived, nervous, maybe a little hungover hungry, but most of all, coming to terms with the fact that you could get (dare I say it?) quadded. You committed to River Run and prayed to the Housing Gods, but you never know where fate will take you.
Fast forward to 9:30 a.m. Footsteps accelerate as they make their way to your door. Voices shouting “Lowell! Lowell!” fill the stairwell, and your heart swells. Loud knocks at your door echo through your room, and your blockmate rushes over to let the dorm stormers in.
POV: It’s 9:32 a.m. and you just got Quadded.
If this series of events is a description of your worst nightmare, don’t worry. Flyby has got you covered in terms of how to respond and how not to respond to getting Quadded.
Don’t: cry. This one is simple (and pretty intuitive). You will be living in the same House as your dorm stormers next year, so this wouldn’t be the best way to respond.
Do: look forward to guaranteed (ish) singles, no moldy carpets (I’m looking at you Mather) and the lack of rats/mice/rodents in general (I’m looking at you Eliot, Leverett, Kirkland, Mather again…).
Don’t: jump under the covers and hide from your dorm stormers. Again, you are going to be living with your dorm stormers, and this isn’t the best first impression to make.
Do: jump with joy. The Quad is guaranteed to give you great community and lots of fun memories over the next three years, including studying at Cabot Cafe with its immaculate vibes, playing spike ball or sunbathing in the Quad lawn and getting Sunday morning Bagelsaurus bagels.
Don’t: throw anything at the dorm stormers. Not sure if this has ever happened, but just as a reminder.
Do: get hyped for Housing Day 2024 — one of the best parts of living in the Quad is getting to be the bearer of bad news to first-years! Just kidding, of course.
Do: forgive the dorm stormers for gaslighting you into thinking you got put into Lowell.
Do: remember that while there is somehow some sort of stigma surrounding getting Quadded, it will all soon fade. The hype of Housing Day will eventually die down, and you will develop a sense of quad-pride. After all, the final stage of the 7 stages of grief is acceptance—you’ll get there.
Don’t: cry. Did I say this one already?
Do: know that housing is completely arbitrary, and that each house will only be as good as what you make it!
As a brand newly sorted fish, tree or polar bear, getting Quadded comes with a series of inevitable emotions. We promise that happiness, new friends and exciting memories await you however Housing Day ends up. Especially if you get Quadded.

At 11 p.m. on a Thursday evening, students crowd the Winthrop Grille on the first floor of Beren Hall. Entirely student-run, the Winthrop Grille is one of four across the residential houses. The Crimson Multimedia staff visited the Grilles to get a slice of student nightlife.
Above, Angela P. Caloia ’23 serves lobster rangoons, one of over half a dozen fried options at the Winthrop Grille.
The Winthrop Grille reopened in December 2022 following a two-year closure because of the pandemic. Their new menu features churros and Oreo milkshakes. Camille N. Baker ’25 and Caloia prepare dino nuggets and churros.
Further up Plympton St., Quincy Grille is in full swing. The Quincy Grille reopened at the start of the fall semester along with the Dunster and Quad Grilles.
Jacob R. Jimenez ’23-’24, left, is the Dunster Grille manager. In this position, he’s responsible for creating the menu, setting prices, and hiring staff.
On the right, students staffing the Quincy Grille fetch supplies in a backroom. In the center, burgers and a quesadilla sizzle.
The Quad Grille reopened on Halloweekend of last year with a special themed menu, featuring fried cheesecake with berry blood and a Frankenstein milkshake. Located in Pforzheimer House, the Grille serves all three houses in the Radcliffe Quadrangle.
The house grilles are open to students in all grades — their schedules can be found on the house websites.
