After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While common students spent the first Sunday of the semester reuniting and catching up with friends, student organization officers, stashed away at a meeting in the distant and dreary Student Organization Center at Hilles, were presented with a high-stakes and urgent update pertinent to the improvement of student life on campus.
What could possibly be so important? The Harvard College Dean of Students Office announced that it would begin enforcing a rule restricting Harvard branding in student organization names. According to the policy, club names must contain either “Harvard Undergraduate” or “Harvard College” and “Student(s)” if they were founded after 1998, the year in which the previously-unenforced rule came into effect.
We commend Associate Dean for Student Engagement Jason R. Meier for this worthy crusade, an indisputable institutional priority. In an era of political polarization, state interference in University syllabi, and catastrophic climate change, we are comforted by the administration's close focus on branding accuracy.
With Meier’s help — hand-in-hand with undergraduate, and undergraduate only, student club leaders — Harvard’s campus can usher in a new age of revived and inclusive student programming, lofty goals that current naming guidelines had (somehow) clearly hindered. In the spirit of the changing times, we, The Crimson Editorial Board, humbly offer some new naming policy ideas to implement alongside this new one.
1. The DSO must lead by example in this crucial, valiant endeavor to make names more accurate. The office ought to rename itself, and do so fast, lest any students or bureaucratic processes be harmed in the most terrifyingly intangible ways. The “Dean of Harvard College and Undergraduate Students Office for Harvard College Undergraduates” is a feasible replacement.
2. Similarly, Meier’s position should henceforth be known as that of “Chief Undergraduate Engagement and Student Life Improvement Czar at Harvard College.” Associate Dean for Student Engagement is obviously far too vague for our new philosophy.
3. In that vein, Harvard should require all professors to vocally introduce themselves, in every setting, as “Harvard College Professor of Students,” promptly adding their area of study and main doctoral thesis advisor, if applicable. After all, if student organizations can (and, for some reason yet to be clearly explained by the DSO, must) go to absurd extremes to clarify their membership, our campus deserves a more easily identifiable faculty body.
4. In order to be clear “in all instances and contexts,” House name abbreviations such as “Eliot” ought to be prohibited under punishment of “Being Forced to Appear Before the Harvard College Administrative Board”-ing. “Charles W. Eliot House” barely provides sufficient clarity; "Charles W. Eliot House for Undergraduate Students of Harvard College" is best.
5. The Harvard Corporation should only be referred to by its legal name, “the President and Fellows of Harvard College,” and, as usual, should be brought into conversation only if strictly necessary (discussion of undergraduate politics, the most influential arena on campus, remains preferable to analysis of the power brokers).
6. No more acronyms. They’re clearly too confusing and misleading, far too complex for the average Harvard affiliate. All student organizations must always be referred to by their full legal name.
7. In this spirit of tautology and specificity, the Quad should now be known as the “Radcliffe Quadrangle,” and the “Radcliffe Quadrangle” only. Any colloquialisms only cause confusion and should be disallowed.
8. Similarly, to eliminate confusion, Annenberg Hall should officially be renamed “Berg.” Everybody already calls it that anyways. Do better.
9. On the subject of Berg, it’s imperative that we change the lettuce options in the salad bar to iceberg lettuce only. Other offerings are inconsistent with its naming and visual culture.
10. Meanwhile, our beloved Harvard-Yale must be renamed the “Harvard Undergraduate-Yale Undergraduate Sporting Event Featuring the Sport of Football,” for clarity. A name like “Harvard-Yale” implies some sort of moral equivalence. Surely, that can’t be the case.
11. When Housing Day arrives, Quadlings — or undergraduates living in the Radcliffe Quadrangle — ought not to pose as Riverlings. Many of the freshmen are confused by it. This is why they cry.
12. Also on that note, the Dean of Harvard College and Undergraduate Students Office for Harvard College Undergraduates should implement a new policy prohibiting ’Throp, Eli-lit, Kirk or any of the other House sign names on Housing Day — doing so runs counter to our new mantra of name accuracy.
13. The freshman union dormitories shall never again be called the union dormitories, but rather the “Harvard Freshman Undergraduate Not-in-Harvard-Yard” dormitories. They are not in Harvard Yard and therefore not in the union.
14. As for Harvard College — well, it should model maximal adherence to its rules in its own name. Perhaps “Harvard Undergraduate College”? Or “Harvard Place for College Students”? No — “Harvard Undergraduate College and Students Learning Institute for the Acronymically Inept” is most apt.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To be a descendant of slavery is to be an “other” within the Black community at Harvard. The time is now to dig beyond the surface of a diverse community and interrogate all facets of Black representation: Who is being left behind and how can Harvard reimagine what diversity looks like as it remembers the mark that slavery has left on its descendants?
According to Harvard professor Henry Louis “Skip” Gates Jr., between one-half and two-thirds of Black students at Harvard in 2004 were either West Indian and African immigrants or their children, or children of biracial couples. This would mean that descendants of slavery in America — those known as Generational African Americans — are starkly underrepresented.
The term “Generational African American” was coined by Reverend Isaiah Webb, grandfather of Samantha C. W. O’Sullivan ’22. O’Sullivan was the founder of the Generational African American Students Association at Harvard.
In 2015, U.S.-born Black households had a median income and educational attainment level that was about 30 percent and 7 percent lower, respectively, than that of Black immigrant households. This likely causes more Generational African Americans to sit at the intersection of low socioeconomic status and being first-generation college students — a combination that has both proven to serve as a barrier to college admission and has strong ties to slavery.
The Generational African American identity is one that has endured more pain and perseverance than one can imagine — pain and perseverance that has not ceased to penetrate our lives today. The socioeconomic effects of slavery and oppression under Jim Crow are alive and well and continue to exist as a boundary to higher education for those who are descended from those who experienced its restrictions.
Harvard is an institution that, given its ties to slavery, has a reparative responsibility to Generational African Americans.
Previous instances of this conversation have incited conflict amongst Black groups across the diaspora. College admissions is not a zero-sum game and the purpose of this discussion is to point out a disparity, not to disunify the Black community. Rather than this raising a question of whether Black immigrants are deserving of their hard-earned seats at these elite institutions (which is not even up for discussion), I wish to call on Harvard to recognize their failure at ensuring the representation of Generational African American descendants of slavery.
It is integral that college admissions committees stop treating Blackness as a monolith. Harvard is hiding behind the checkbox of “Black/African American.” Rather than taking time to truly appreciate the unique perspective that each and every Black person brings with them, and allowing space for more nuanced identification, this checkbox collapses the multifaceted Black experience into one category.
In the wake of the lawsuit between the Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard College, universities across the country are looking to Harvard to stand for diversity. Even if affirmative action is deemed unconstitutional, institutions like Harvard are responsible for ensuring that diversity is maintained. Harvard should set a precedent — one that takes accountability for its part in the legacy of slavery not solely through a public report, but through the recognition of the deficit of descendants on this campus.
So where do we go from here? As a Generational African American at Harvard myself, I wish I had the statistics to describe the feeling of otherness that stems from being a minority within a minority. Therefore, the first step to improving representation among Generational African American students is to offer a more specific breakdown of Black identities. Then, the schools can quantify the disparity and potentially understand the drivers and its connection to the legacy of slavery. Whether Harvard is aware of the issue and simply chooses to ignore it, or if they do not notice it at all, it is their responsibility to fix it.
Either way, to be a school so publicly claiming responsibility for its part in perpetuating the egregious legacy of slavery, Harvard must grapple with the fact that it so often closes its doors to those same students whose ancestors built it.

Melanie Matchett Wood is a professor of mathematics at Harvard University and a Radcliffe Alumnae Professor at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. In October, she was awarded the MacArthur Fellowship “Genius Grant” for her creative work in number theory.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
FM: In online articles profiling you and your research, one of the first questions they always ask is: “What is number theory and arithmetic and algebraic geometry?” It’s an important one for me and for our readers, so could you pare it down from the high level at which you’re working to middle school or high school math?
MMW: Number theory is the study of the whole numbers, and in those, especially the prime numbers, how other whole numbers can be constructed by multiplying together primes and the patterns in which that happens. And it turns out almost all of math is very richly interconnected, and certainly number theory is.
Part of my research and how I try to answer questions about numbers is by using other tools. Algebraic geometry refers to understanding the geometry of shapes that are cut out by polynomial equations, so a very familiar one of these might be a parabola — it’s cut out by this polynomial equation y equals x squared, y and x polynomials. You could graph some shape that equation described, and algebraic geometry is the study of the geometry of the shapes that can be cut out by polynomials. It turns out that these things are very related even though at first it doesn’t sound that way.
FM: I’ve taken advanced math classes most of my life, up through calculus and linear algebra. But how come I’ve never heard of this before? Where does it fit in within the math chronology that people grow up knowing in school? Or if it doesn’t fit in, why not?
MMW: The math chronology in schools is quite different from the lay of the land of math research. It doesn’t fit very well. It’s not that they’re unrelated. The math chronology in schools is not a path through the math that is out there, probably because it’s focused on teaching people certain practical skills. Where you would have seen some bits of something like number theory is probably you learned, at some point, to be able to take an integer and factor it into primes, especially if you were trying to put a fraction in lowest terms.
You see little touches of number theory in the traditional school education but not so much, which is interesting because it’s one of the oldest topics of mathematics that has been studied. A lot of the questions about the whole numbers have been studied for thousands of years.
FM: What are the real-world implications of your work? Like, if we discover answers to these unanswered or open problems, how would that translate into you know, like, real-world applications?
MMW: My work is in what some people call “pure math,” but the basic science of mathematics. I’m trying to understand the foundational things that seem most important to know about numbers, not with some particular application in mind. There’s lots of wonderful applied mathematics, but that's not what I’m doing. However, throughout history, we see that much of science has been built on mathematics that was developed before that science or those applications were even imagined.
For example, today’s entire digital economy and world relies on the fact that we can encrypt information, that we have some way to reasonably easily encode things so that only people with a certain key can decode them. All of today’s encryption systems are built on number theory, on properties of prime numbers in particular, and on mathematics that was developed before there were computers. That’s the picture of how things are. I think we develop basic mathematics, we try to understand the most foundational things behind numbers, shapes, patterns, and it has paid off over time that the mathematics that we’ve developed has been used for things that we might not have imagined when we developed it.
FM: You’ve earned the title “first woman” to do something in your field quite a few times in your career, starting with being the first female competitor on the U.S. Math Olympiad Team. What was it like to come of age in the math competition circuit as one of the only women performing at that level?
MMW: It was difficult in a lot of ways, in different ways. Ways in which I felt like I didn’t belong. It was hard to be the only girl at a month-long summer training camp of 30-something students. It was also hard in ways in which I felt that there was a tremendous amount of attention and focus and pressure, because I was the only girl — as if, how I performed, I was representing girls as a whole. That was hard.
FM: How has women’s role in mathematics changed over the last two decades or so that you’ve been involved?
MMW: Frustratingly slowly. There has been some progress but the percentage, say, of math Ph.D.s that are women has been frustratingly stubborn. There are still many times when I’m the only woman in the room. I don’t want to forget that there has been some progress made. I think in general, there’s a lot more attention now to how we can make the field welcoming to everyone, to men and women and people from all sorts of backgrounds, and I think that’s an improvement. But still, the progress is slow.
FM: What initially drew you to math?
MMW: It was actually math competitions. In seventh grade, I got involved in this Mathcounts competition. And that was the first time I had seen problems where I hadn’t been taught how to do that problem. For me, math in school previously had been: they teach you how to do a problem, and you do the problems in the way that they taught you. What I really loved about the Mathcounts problems for me at that stage was that I hadn’t been taught how to do that particular problem. It was like a puzzle. You had to think and try different things, and then something would work. That was the hook for me into math, the opportunity to figure something out on my own.
FM: What continues to hold your interest?
MMW: Still that same thing. When I started college, I didn’t realize that there was still math that people had to figure out and that was something you could do as part of your job. I didn’t realize until later in college that that was something that my math professors were doing and that was a job. That’s still what I love. I love figuring things out that we didn’t know.
FM: Your work and your research has been lauded for its creativity. Where do you find the creativity? When one approach might fail, how do you find the next thing to turn to?
MMW: There are a lot of different sources of new ideas when the ones you already had weren’t working. Good collaborators is important, having someone to talk to and bounce ideas off of back and forth is really helpful. I often find it helpful to play devil’s advocate. If I’m trying to show that something is true and the things I’m doing aren’t working, I think, “Well, what if I were trying to show it’s false?” Even if I think it’s true, I try to find a counterexample. Sometimes, you can sort of feel where you’re being blocked to find a counterexample, maybe that’s the hint. For me,also bringing in perspectives from a lot of different kinds of mathematics, sometimes directly tools from other parts of mathematics but also sometimes just even the perspective, the way of looking at things, organizing things, thinking about them, has been useful.
FM: The MacArthur Fellowship ‘Genius Grant’ comes with a $800,000 “no strings attached” prize. How are you planning to use the grant for your research? Or is there anything else you’re planning on doing with it?
MMW: I’ll be honest: At first, I was imagining organizing conferences and workshops that were a little off the beaten path, that got people talking to each other and learning from each other more than traditionally happens. But upon further reflection, I realized that is something I can probably do through more traditional means and that this fellowship is a really special opportunity. Part of “no strings attached” was that there wasn’t a hurry to decide what to do with it. And so I’m now thinking that I don’t know yet, but that it's worth waiting and thinking and trying to find something that I really couldn’t do any other way.
FM: Tackling problems in number theory that have stood unanswered for decades, if not centuries, seems like a daunting task. What’s the day-to-day like of your job?
MMW: The day-to-day involves a lot of things that of course aren’t just tackling those problems. Working with students and mentoring and teaching and going to seminars and working on things with my colleagues and the department.
When I do sit down and research, for me, it’s a lot of filling sheafs and sheafs of paper. I write a lot and I try a lot of things. And if you saw me, I would just be filling pages and pages of different things and trying things, so perhaps not very exciting to watch. It’s slow, many of the things take many years. But the day-to-day is trying different ideas and looking for examples and following different leads and seeing where they go and all of that that physically comprises filling sheafs and sheafs of paper.
FM: Do you have any tangible goals for 2023?
MMW: I have a paper that I’m working on with a colleague at Columbia. It was a paper that we set out to write a couple of years ago but we kept finding that before we could finish that project, we needed to do another project first. So now we have completed three projects that we found in the way of the project we really wanted to finish. Now we’re working on that, and I’m hoping we can get it finished, though there was recently an article about this project in Quantum Magazine and my collaborator was quoted saying, “I don’t think this project is ever going to end.” So we’ll see. The things that we discovered along the way have been fun and exciting as well, so if it keeps happening that we discover surprising and exciting things along the way, I guess I’ll be thankful for that too.
FM: Are there any big open questions that you predict might be answered in the next 10 years? Or is that too short of a time span?
MMW: In terms of famous open questions, I don’t know of any that seem likely to be solved in the next 10 years. But one of the things about math is that sometimes it is hard to predict. You don’t know where the ideas might come from. It’s hard to say. Often, many big developments come as a surprise.
FM: Do you have any hidden talents or interests besides math that people might be surprised to learn?
MMW: The thing that I studied most in college after math was theater, particularly classical theater like Shakespeare.
FM: What's your favorite Shakespeare play? And what roles did you remember loving?
MMW: Perhaps the thing that really stands out to me most: I assistant-directed a production of “Macbeth” that I was very proud to be part of. Now, I only enjoy theater as an audience member.
FM: What was the last show you saw that was really memorable?
MMW: I just, actually, last Friday night took my kids to see “Hamilton.” That was maybe my fourth or fifth time seeing it.
My daughter and I were supposed to see it in 2020. We had gotten tickets, and they got canceled because of the pandemic.
FM: Dean Khurana of the College recently shared a resume of his rejections — projects that never came to fruition, grants, fellowships, and academic appointments that he was turned down for — as an exercise, and others have posted resumes of rejections or failures online as well. What’s one item on your resume of failures, and what advice do you have for students or researchers who are dealing with their own share?
MMW: I first think of many examples in my current life when I submit papers for publication. A lot of the process of submitting papers for publication is you get them rejected, and you try again. But to something closer to the student experience, when I was applying to grad school and applying for fellowships, I applied for a Defense Department graduate fellowship, and I didn’t get in. But I applied again the next year, and I applied for other things.
I think this is a nice idea to share since people share their successes but not their rejections and you don’t realize that everyone has lots of rejections. That’s part of the process of life. If you’re not ever getting rejections or failing, you’re not trying hard or interesting enough things. You have to keep trying and interpret that as a sign that you’re on a good path of challenging yourself and striving when you run into failures and rejection.
FM: There’s a lot on the internet about how mathematicians love their chalk. Do you have a favorite chalk?
MMW: Absolutely. When the news broke that Hagoromo was going out of business, I calculated what I thought would be my lifetime supply and purchased a personal lifetime supply of Hagoromo chalk. It turned out that they sold the formula to another company and so it was perhaps unnecessary, but just in case, I am prepared.

Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui is developing the “Cambridge Promise” program, which would fund free community college for all Cambridge residents, she said in an interview Thursday.
While the proposal remains under development, Siddiqui said she hopes the city can launch a pilot program in the near future, adding that college access is a “priority.”
“A lot of our students are unable to afford college, right, and so that’s been an issue that’s come up,” Siddiqui said. “What do we do in that respect?”
Siddiqui said she hopes the program will address the “key issue” of college affordability and will “make a difference for students.” She added that she hopes Harvard will invest in the Cambridge Promise program to continue the University’s involvement in local public education.
“I think they are such a big player in our city, and they shape the city in so, so many ways,” Siddiqui said. “So inherently, I think it’s important that they get involved.”
Siddiqui — a graduate of Cambridge Public Schools and current chair of the district’s School Committee — said that while Cambridge is a well-resourced public school district that spends “a lot of money per pupil,” she is determined to reduce the “persistent” opportunity gaps.
“We’re a diverse community with a strong commitment to investing in our public school system,” she said. “We have a lot of opportunity for growth and how we improve outcomes, especially for students of color — and that’s something that is important to me.”
To close these gaps, Siddiqui said she has prioritized the development and implementation of universal pre-K programs within CPS. Earlier this week, the city shared plans to fund preschool access for all four-year-olds in the district beginning in the 2024-2025 school year.
“Access to early childhood education really can set up a framework for future success,” Siddiqui said. “We’re seeing right now, in our data, really the disparities in education when it comes to race and your background, whether you’re low-income or not.”
Beyond early childhood education, Siddiqui said she also aims to provide equitable paths to higher education.
Siddiqui has worked with the district on the Early College Program — a Massachusetts state-designated Early College Initiative program in partnership with Lesley University — to allow Cambridge Rindge and Latin School students to receive up to two years of college credits for free.
“We’ve heard feedback from our students that ‘Wow, I’m going to a college classroom and getting that experience,’” Siddiqui said. “I’m just glad we’re able to help our students with some of that.”
Siddiqui said her time as a student at Cambridge Rindge and Latin “shaped” who she is today.
During her time in high school, Siddiqui co-founded The Cambridge Youth Council — a group committed to improving the lives of youth through “social justice, education, and community building” that remains active 20 years later.
“From the Cambridge school system, I really gained that skill set in the beginning of advocacy and wanting to help people,” she said.
Siddiqui said her early advocacy experiences prompted her to work with CPS students.
“I love working with the students, and I think they really help draft great policy,” she said.
“My role is to hear your voices,” Siddiqui added.
Correction: February 19, 2023
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Early College Program at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School is in its pilot stage. In fact, the program was piloted in January 2022 and received state designation in April.

More than 50 Harvard affiliates gathered on the steps of Memorial Church for a candlelit vigil on Thursday to mourn the victims of earthquakes in Turkey and Syria earlier this month.
The magnitude 7.8 earthquake, which struck Feb. 6, killed more than 40,000 people and left tens of thousands injured or missing. The initial earthquake was followed by more than 30 aftershocks of at least magnitude 4.5, leaving hundreds of thousands facing freezing overnight temperatures without shelter or power.
University Muslim Chaplain Khalil Abdur-Rashid spoke at the vigil, offering prayers to victims, rescue workers, and volunteers who are responding to the ongoing humanitarian crisis.
“We are deeply moved in our own community, not only by the catastrophic loss that affects us all, but — more importantly — by the news that some of our own students here on campus were directly impacted by both of these earthquakes,” he said.
Abdur-Rashid added he was “inspired by the glimmers of hope and survival” in the aftermath of the earthquakes, referencing the rescue of a young woman who was trapped underneath rubble for 10 days.
“Throughout this huge — this tremendous — catastrophe, there are amazing inspirational signs of human resilience, strength, courage, and hope,” he said.
Sarah Aziz, a Ph.D. candidate in Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, said she attended the vigil to support her friends and colleagues who have been affected by the earthquakes, adding that it offered an opportunity to reflect on the “human connection” to victims in Turkey and Syria.
“This is the least I think we can do being so far away. So I came here because I think I need this. As a human being, it’s good for me,” she said. “It’s good for us to come together.”
Jana Amin ’25 said in a speech that she has felt “vulnerable, empty, exhausted and lost” since the earthquakes.
Amin, the vice president of the Harvard Society of Arab Students, thanked attendees for their support in the wake of the earthquakes but called for more recognition for students on campus who are grieving.
“In the past two weeks, I’ve watched as collective processing here on campus has turned into mobilization, solidarity, and community. And for those efforts, I am so, so grateful,” she said. “Sadly, I’ve also watched as fundraising efforts have been met by blank stares, disrespectful comments, and exhausting apathy.”
At Harvard, two ongoing fundraising campaigns by the Harvard Society of Arab Students and the Harvard Turkish Students Association have collected over $35,000 in donations since the earthquakes.
Hundreds of Turkish Harvard affiliates also penned an open letter to the administration to call for increased recognition of the earthquakes.
“The Harvard community has done a lot so far, and we’re really grateful for all those efforts,” Amin said in an interview after the vigil. “But I think they can continue and do more.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just over three years after setting up shop at one of the most prominent storefronts in Harvard Square, Milk Bar is officially shuttering its doors this Sunday.
Serving cakes, shakes, cookies, and ice cream, Milk Bar — the brainchild of award-winning pastry chef Christina Tosi — debuted its desserts in 2008 at its first shop in New York’s East Village. Since then, it has expanded to major cities across the United States and Canada.
Joe’s Pizza is expected to open in the vacated space in about half a year, according to a statement from the New York-based pizza chain.
Following years of delays, Milk Bar’s Harvard Square location at 1-3 Brattle Street opened shop in February 2019, with swarms of eager customers gathered outside to snag a $1 soft serve opening special. Milk Bar opened as a combination store, sharing a dining space with &pizza — a Washington-based customizable pizza chain.
&pizza closed its Cambridge location last spring, leaving its half of the space empty save for some black and white wallpaper.
Earlier this month, a poster was plastered on Milk Bar’s door, stating that Feb. 19 would be the shop’s last day of operation. The Harvard Square outpost is Milk Bar’s sole shop in the Boston area.
A spokesperson for Milk Bar wrote in an email that the departure of &pizza from the space contributed to the shop’s closing.
“Once the primary tenant (our sublandlord) left the space, we were able to continue to operate our small portion of the space under a direct agreement with the landlord for a period of time, but ultimately it is our understanding that the landlord found a new tenant to take over the full space,” the statement reads.
Milk Bar’s Cambridge location is the second in the chain to close in the last few months, with the Toronto location ceasing operations last December.
Some Harvard students say they will fondly remember the dessert destination.
Reza M. Shamji ’25 said he first heard of the chain when he was nine years old and was able to visit it for the first time in New York at age 11.
“I always wanted to try Milk Bar because I saw pictures of the cereal milk ice cream and birthday cake bowls from my friends in LA when they went to New York,” he said.
“I made my dad, brother, and I trek. It was far from us,” Shamji added.
Katharine A. Forst ’25, a Crimson Sports editor, said she will miss the Milk Bar Pie, which is described on Milk Bar’s website as a “sticky, buttery, salty-sweet filling in a hearty oat cookie crust.”
“It’s just out of this world,” Shamji said when describing the pie.
Meanwhile, Shamji said that his go-to at Milk Bar is the “cereal-milk ice cream with cereal topping” but orders the cereal milkshake when he prefers to sip on something.
With Milk Bar set to close, Forst said Tatte would be a “good alternative.”
In the past few months, multiple new establishments have opened in Harvard Square, including WakuWaku Ramen, Taiyaki NYC, and Faro Café.

In early December 2007, then-University President Drew G. Faust and Harvard Corporation Senior Fellow James R. “Jamie” Houghton ’58 unveiled an extensive overhaul of Harvard College’s financial aid policies to make undergraduate tuition more affordable for middle- and upper-class students. Then, the Great Recession started.
Despite the University’s expensive pledge days ahead of the financial crisis, Faust said Houghton remained by her side through all the challenges.
“We agreed that we needed to make a fundamental commitment to not reducing financial aid, even as we were reducing other things in the budget,” Faust said. “That was a sign of his support and enthusiasm and deep belief in accessibility and affordability of education.”
As a longtime member of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, Houghton navigated Harvard through the resignation of President Lawrence H. Summers and led the presidential search that selected Faust. Houghton died on Dec. 20, 2022, at his home in Boston after a long battle with dementia. He was 86.
Houghton was born in Corning, New York, on April 6, 1936. Hailing from a prestigious family, Houghton was the third generation to attend the same elite educational institutions: Houghton, his father, and his grandfather attended St. Paul’s School and Harvard College. Houghton later obtained a degree from Harvard Business School in 1962.
Both Houghton’s father and grandfather worked in politics. His father, Amory Houghton, Class of 1921, served as U.S. Ambassador to France. His grandfather, Alanson B. Houghton, Class of 1886, served two terms as a U.S. Representative from New York and founded Corning Glass Works — a company that would remain in the family for over a century.
The Houghton Library, which houses Harvard’s collection of rare books and manuscripts, was named after James Houghton’s uncle, Arthur A. Houghton ’29.
During James Houghton’s second year at the Business School, he met Maisie Kinnicutt Houghton ’62, then a senior at Radcliffe College. They married during their final year as Harvard students, in 1962, but Maisie Houghton said it took some persuasion on her end.
“He was quite keen to be married,” she said with a laugh. “I wanted to be a school teacher, and I had no intention of getting married right after graduation.”
Maisie Houghton said she nonetheless accomplished all of her life goals over the course of their marriage. They spent a few years living in Europe, splitting time between Zurich and Brussels. When the family moved back to James Houghton’s hometown in Corning, Maisie Houghton said she became involved in several women’s rights organizations.
“I didn’t think of myself as the perfect corporate wife,” Maisie Houghton said. “I had my own interests and my own life, which Jamie totally encouraged.”
Houghton quickly rose through the ranks of Corning Glass Works, now known as Corning Incorporated. In 1983, he succeeded his brother as chairman and CEO, a role he held until 1996 before he was asked to return for a second stint as CEO in 2002.
The first time Houghton attempted to become a member of Harvard’s governing boards, he failed. Houghton stood for election to the Board of Overseers, the University’s second-highest governing body, but did not garner enough votes to win a seat on the board.
But in 1995, he was selected to join the Harvard Corporation. Houghton would serve on the board for 15 years, rising to the top post of senior fellow in 2002.
Four years into Houghton’s tenure as senior fellow, he faced his greatest challenge at Harvard. The faculty had lost faith in Summers, and Houghton asked the president he once helped select to step down from the role.
A week after Houghton informed Summers that he no longer had confidence in his leadership, Summers announced on Feb. 21, 2006, that he would resign from the presidency.
Tasked with navigating the Corporation through this fraught moment, Houghton turned to Derek C. Bok — Harvard’s president from 1971 to 1991 — in hopes of recruiting him back to the University on an interim basis.
Fortunately for Houghton, the task wasn’t a difficult one, and a short trip to Sarasota, Florida, saw Houghton return to Cambridge with a returning Harvard president in tow.
Though Bok spent only one year back in the presidential office, he said he found Houghton to be an “exemplary” help during the transitional year.
“It was, in many respects, the easiest and most peaceful year that I ever spent in office,” Bok said.
With Bok at the helm to “keep the ship steady,” as he described his mandate, Houghton turned his attention back to the presidential search at hand, guiding the University to recovery after the fallout of Summers’ resignation.
From 2006 to 2007, Houghton headed the presidential search committee that chose Faust, Harvard’s first female president. Former Senior Fellow William F. “Bill” Lee ’72, who served on the Board of Overseers during Houghton’s tenure, said the appointment of Faust was Houghton’s greatest legacy at Harvard.
“He led the selection of Drew at a time of some dysfunction in the Harvard community,” Lee said. “He led a process that resulted in a president who then had a more than decade-long tenure, where she and Harvard accomplished many important things — that has to be his most important and most defining achievement.”
Still, the conclusion of the nearly ten-month presidential search did not immediately silence critics of the University’s direction under Houghton. Some questioned his decision to appoint Faust to the presidency.
“It was a brave thing of him to be the senior fellow who was willing to select a woman,” Faust said. “A lot of people were dubious, like, ‘What? Could she possibly do the job?’”
Even before her selection as University President, Faust said Houghton had already proven himself an advocate for women in higher education. When Harvard and Radcliffe merged in 1999, James Houghton and his wife, Maisie, were staunch supporters of the newly minted Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, establishing a fund to support female undergraduates during the transition period.
“He had been very supportive of women in a number of ways,” Faust said. “He was a person who really believed deeply in inclusion and moving Harvard more rapidly towards embracing those kinds of principles.”
The Corporation itself also saw lasting changes as a result of Houghton’s time at the helm of the board.
During his years as a member of the University’s highest governing body, Houghton sought to bridge the long-standing gap in communication and influence between the Corporation and the Board of Overseers.
Even as the mounting tensions between Summers and the Harvard faculty forced Houghton to take action, he took the time to consult both governing bodies before reaching the decision to encourage Summers to step down.
“At the time, the two governing bodies operated very much separately, independently,” Lee said. “He brought the leadership of the Overseers — Patti Saris, the president, in particular — into the discussion.”
Under Houghton’s leadership, the Harvard Corporation began an internal review of its relationship with the Board of Overseers in 2010, resulting in reforms that Lee said strengthened the partnership.
Later that year, the Corporation rolled out a significant overhaul of the University’s governance structure, doubling the size of its membership and establishing term limits.
In addition to broad reforms, Houghton’s colleagues said he also worked to make sure that more voices were heard and represented in the two bodies. Nannerl O. Keohane, who joined the Corporation in 2005, said Houghton helped ease the transition as she adjusted to her role.
“He supported me as a new member of the Corporation in ways that I shall always be grateful for,” she said.
Having joined the Corporation as the sole woman and with only an honorary degree from the University, Keohane said she worried that lacking a Harvard background would lead her to make mistakes.
“Jamie made it clear that that really didn’t matter,” she said. “He wanted me to contribute everything that I could and to succeed and to relax, and he basically made me feel that in a very gracious way.”
Not only did Houghton facilitate smoother working relationships between his colleagues, Lee said, he also helped members of the University’s highest boards to become better friends.
“At the end of the day, he was a wonderful Corporation colleague, he was a wonderful senior fellow, but to me, he and Maisie were better friends,” Lee said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Kennedy School students advocated for need-based application fee waivers and emergency funds for students with unexpected expenses in a letter to the school’s dean, Douglas W. Elmendorf, Wednesday.
The letter, authored by the First-Generation and Low-Income Caucus, was endorsed by the Kennedy School Student Government, as well as 14 student affinity groups. HKS, which requires its applicants to pay a $100 application fee, is the only Harvard school aside from the Extension School that does not provide a fee waiver for financial need.
“If HKS truly cares about diversifying its class, the very least it can do is implement a clear, streamlined process for getting fee waivers, if not waiving them for low-income and FLI students altogether as other universities have done,” the letter reads.
HKS spokesperson James F. Smith confirmed in an email that Elmendorf received the letter.
“He looks forward to meeting with the students who raised these issues,” Smith wrote.
FLI Caucus co-president Viet A. Nguyen said in an interview that the letter presents proposals that would be “really easy, quick wins” that the school can implement to improve the diversity of the student body and bolster the support HKS students receive.
Nguyen added that when he applied to HKS, his request for an application fee waiver was denied — an experience he said is common among FGLI students at HKS.
“There are so many other students who probably didn’t even apply because of the fee application,” he said.
The letter also outlines the FLI Caucus’ plan to reach out to program managers of emergency student funds at other Harvard schools — including Harvard College, Harvard Medical School, and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences — to understand the cost of the funds and how they disperse money.
The College offers a Beneficiary Aid Program that provides additional assistance to financial aid recipients who face emergency medical or dental costs during the term that constitute “extreme financial hardship.”
The letter advocates for the creation of a “hardship fund” for HKS students.
“The expense of being at the Kennedy School [is] high and for many low-income students here, we are one emergency away from dropping out,” the letter reads.
Nguyen also criticized HKS’ merit-based aid system rather than awarding assistance solely based on financial need.
“Oftentimes, when we bring up this issue, we get stonewalled with ‘We can’t afford it,’ ‘There’s not enough money,’” he said. “We just want to know: We don’t have enough money now — how much money do we need, so that we can begin fundraising and thinking about long-term goals.”
Quint Forgey, vice president of communications, technology, and operations for the Kennedy School Student Government, said the student government is “proud” to co-sponsor the letter to the Dean.
“We reviewed its priorities and they represent the type of practical, actionable change the KSSG always hopes for on campus,” he said. “We are all confident that its proposals will affect the lives of HKS students in immediate and actionable ways, and we’re going to stand by the FLI Caucus as a lobbyist on behalf of these comments as policy changes to the HKS administration.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2014, after former Harvard Business School associate professor Benjamin G. “Ben” Edelman ’02 ordered takeout food from the Sichuan Garden — a Chinese restaurant in Brookline — he discovered a $4 overcharge.
Edelman then emailed the restaurant demanding a refund and threatening legal action, sparking an ugly back-and-forth that made headlines nationwide.
In a civil lawsuit against Harvard filed Tuesday in the Suffolk County Superior Court, Edelman alleges that the 2014 email correspondence — for which he later apologized at the Business School’s request — resurfaced when he was being evaluated for tenure, among other concerns of misconduct.
The complaint also alleges that internal HBS inquiries into Edelman’s behavior “unlawfully and brazenly” flouted the school’s policies. The inquiries culminated in a report that Edelman claims led to his tenure denial.
In an interview, Edelman — now a chief economist at Microsoft — said the inquiries reached an “incorrect conclusion” about his character with “serious consequences” for his tenure consideration.
“The core of it is that the school raised these charges against me that were pretextual — they weren’t what anyone was really concerned about,” Edelman said. “They managed to create this narrative that this guy is a bad guy. He’s someone we can’t have around. He’s always causing problems for us.”
In the complaint, Edelman asked the court to award him damages and order the school to review his application for tenure once again. In the interview, he said he was qualified, a “good fit” for tenure, and would accept a tenured position if the school gave him an offer.
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on Edelman’s complaint.
According to the lawsuit, HBS convened a Faculty Review Board in 2015 to investigate concerns about his personal conduct, including the Sichuan Garden incident, during his tenure evaluation.
The investigation — which concluded that Edelman had failed to uphold the Business School’s statement of “Community Values” — led the committee reviewing Edelman’s tenure to recommend his associate professorship be extended for two years, thereby delaying his tenure case. During that time period, Edelman was asked to take several actions to demonstrate his growth from the 2014 incidents, including teaching a business ethics course, per the complaint.
In 2017, the suit alleges, HBS reconvened the FRB to examine Edelman’s behavior further, despite Edelman addressing concerns raised in the 2015 investigation. According to the complaint, the 2017 FRB report violated HBS policies by presenting a list of 12 “conclusory derogatory comments” that served as “effectively a string of personal attacks” against Edelman without evidence or context.
A 2015 document outlining HBS policies for faculty misconduct investigations requires that FRB reports include the “evidence gathered” in its investigation, a conclusion on whether misconduct occurred, and an analysis of the severity of the offense, according to the complaint.
The filing alleges the FRB failed to meet these requirements.
“Neither Plaintiff nor the members of the Appointments Committee ever received the evidence that the FRB gathered. Indeed, the FRB provided no notes, recordings, or ‘interview transcripts,’” the lawsuit reads. “Instead, the FRB relied on decontextualized anonymous criticisms to reach its conclusions.”
In the interview, Edelman said the comments in the FRB report were “devoid of context.”
“It doesn’t say who said it; you can’t tell if it’s one person or 12 different people or something in between; it doesn’t tell you what they were talking about,” Edelman said. “They’re not direct verbatim quotes. They’re just some paraphrases of something that someone maybe said.”
The lawsuit also alleges that one member of the FRB investigating Edelman’s conduct and one staff member who did supportive work for the board had “incurable” conflicts of interests with Edelman.
One of Edelman’s attorneys, Ruth K. O’Meara-Costello ’02 — who also is representing embattled Harvard professor John L. Comaroff — said she believed those two individuals, referenced in the complaint as S1 and S2, are still employed at HBS and are “fairly high-level administrators.” She declined to comment on their identities.
Edelman’s legal team also includes David A. Russcol and Harvey A. Silverglate. Silverglate is also running a write-in campaign for the Harvard Board of Overseers — Harvard’s second-highest governing body.
Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig said there was “no ambiguity” that Edelman was deserving of tenure.
“I don’t think anybody who looked at his record thought that his record was anything other than at the very top of the tenure performance at the Business School,” Lessig said.
Edelman said he believes the negative publicity from the Sichuan Garden incident was a key reason for his tenure denial, adding there is “some fundamental truth to the centrality of that media disaster.”
“Had it not been for those stupid restaurant emails, I would have been just fine,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jeff Marootian — President Joe Biden’s nominee for Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy in the Department of Energy — spoke about implementing “the President’s vision” and offered career advice at a Harvard Law School event Wednesday.
The event was co-hosted by the Environmental and Energy Law Program, Environmental Law Society, and Armenian Law Students Association at HLS. Marootian, who currently serves as a senior advisor in the Department of Energy, previously worked as director of the District Department of Transportation.
During his talk, Marootian said he “fell in love” with working within the transportation space in government because of the ability to “reduce carbon emissions and create healthier neighborhoods and communities.”
“The position that I’ve been nominated for at the Department of Energy, essentially it houses the nexus between transportation and clean energy,” he said. “It connects to transportation in such a critical and important way and in a way that’s really important for this Administration.”
Prior to the nomination, Marootian served in the Obama administration as Assistant Secretary for Administration and Chief Sustainability Officer for the U.S. Department of Transportation and as a member of the Biden-Harris transition team.
Marootian said his priority as Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, if confirmed, is to “help execute and implement the President’s vision.”
“Largely, the portfolio that I am working on at the Department of Energy is really focused on renewable energy and energy efficiency in particular, but implementing Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the CHIPS and Science Act — three signature pieces of legislation of course, to this administration,” he said.
Marootian said, despite the fanfare surrounding these enacted pieces of legislation, implementing these policies requires additional work.
“Most of the fanfare is around the passage of the law, and getting those things kind of over the legislative finish line,” he said. “But the real details are the implementation of it, and so getting to be a part of the team that’s helping to drive progress on implementing is particularly important.”
Marootian also reflected on the role his Armenian heritage has played in his life and shared his appreciation for the Armenian Law Students Association, which co-hosted the event.
“I grew up in North Jersey,” he said. “I was probably the only Armenian kid that I knew anyway, other than my sister, so I always welcome the opportunity to be a part of any other Armenian community that will have me.”
“A lot of what I’ve done in my career, and a lot of the relationships and networking that have helped get me to where I am today, has been through many folks in the Armenian community who have always looked out for me,” he added. “It’s really important that we as young adult professionals and as professionals just continue to look out for each other — so appreciate the opportunity to be here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students will have the opportunity to vote on eight proposed amendments to the Harvard Undergraduate Association’s constitution during the body’s elections this weekend.
The eight amendments include proposals to push back the election timeline, rename the co-presidency, and restructure the body’s teams. The spring election will mark the first time undergraduates have voted on amendments to the constitution of the newly-formed HUA.
Because the Association is not a legislative body, amendments should be “initiated rarely,” according to the HUA’s constitution. Amendment processes can start with a petition signed by at least 5 percent of College students or by a unanimous vote of the HUA executive team.
Over winter break, the HUA convened a working group that developed recommendations for the constitutional amendments, according to documents sent to undergraduates this month.
A proposed amendment can only be approved by a two-thirds majority of voters, according to the HUA’s constitution.
Voting on HUA officers, co-presidents, and constitutional amendments is set to commence on Feb. 17 and conclude at midnight on Feb. 19.
Here is The Crimson’s guide to the HUA’s proposed amendments to its constitution:
The first change proposes adding a new clause that formally recognizes that the HUA is run in accordance with the bylaws, which support the constitution and operations of the body.
“The Bylaws may not contradict the Constitution, only supplement it,” a description of the first proposal reads. “The Bylaws may be updated with a vote of the Executive team, requiring all but one member voting in favor.”
The second proposal which students will vote on would divide the Well-Being Team into two separate teams, the Well-Being Team and the Inclusion Team.
The Well-Being Team would be responsible for “helping students navigate resources on Harvard’s campus regarding emotional, mental, and physical health,” including working with Counseling and Mental Health Services and Harvard University Health Services.
Several of this year’s HUA presidential candidates have supported improving mental health resources for students.
The Inclusion Team would focus on identity-related resources, working with the Office for Gender Equity; the Office for Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging; the Harvard Foundation; and the Accessible Education Office.
The HUA allowed candidates to run for the inclusion officer position this election, noting that if the proposal is not passed, the role will not be instated.
Next, students will have the chance to vote on the creation of a First-Year Team led by the next pair of co-presidents.
The team would be composed entirely of freshmen — except for the co-presidents — and gather information on topics including freshman seminars, pre-orientation programs, and comp processes for joining extracurricular clubs. The group would also aim to educate freshmen about the HUA and its resources.
The fourth proposal would modify the HUA constitution to add a co-treasurer to the Finance Team, which administers funding for student organizations.
Co-treasurers would not be permitted to run on the same ticket, and the winners would be the two candidates who receive the most votes.
Another proposal would push back the timing of the HUA’s spring elections for officer and co-presidency positions. In the proposed timeline, voting will be held two weeks after the end of spring break. Under the current constitution, elections are held in the third week of the spring semester.
In addition, officer terms would begin and end on April 20, with a shadowing period for incoming officers to learn from their predecessors.
The sixth proposed amendment would specify that a referendum can only occur in the middle of the fall semester. The language would clarify that a constitutional referendum process can only occur once per semester.
The HUA solicited votes in the fall for what would have been its first-ever referendum — which included three provisions to change the Association’s bylaws and constitution — but the results were voided after a misunderstanding with the Dean of Students Office.
The next amendment would remove language that provisions for special event grants and explains the timeline for grants.
For semesterly budget requests, the amendment would remove language around when requests are due and approved, and for monthly processes, it would remove language indicating that applications are reviewed by the end of each month.
The amendment would also completely remove the section on post-grant evaluation for special event grants.
The final amendment would rename the current title for the body’s leaders, replacing every occurrence of “co-president” with “co-coordinator” in the HUA’s constitution.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge city officials pledged reforms to the city’s policing practices in a set of statements released Tuesday in response to the killing of Sayed Faisal in January.
The killing of Faisal by a Cambridge Police Department officer sparked ten Boston-area protests and a city-wide reckoning on policing. Faisal, who was a 20-year-old Bangladeshi American at the University of Massachusetts Boston, was shot and killed by a CPD officer after he allegedly approached officers wielding a knife.
Tuesday’s release included specific promises from City Manager Yi-An Huang ’05 to equip CPD officers with body cameras, create an alternative emergency response program independent of the police, and “evaluate additional less lethal options.”
The City Council voted earlier this month on a policy order to initiate the process of obtaining body cameras. CPD Spokesperson Jeremy C. Warnick wrote in an email that CPD is looking to “fast-track” the “implementation as quickly as possible.”
All present councilors voted in support of the order with the exception of Quinton Y. Zondervan, who has previously spoken out against the implementation of body cameras, citing privacy concerns.
“The problem is the guns, not the body cameras,” Zondervan said in a Feb. 6 City Council meeting that was conducted virtually after a protest broke out in City Hall.
The funding of an alternative emergency response program is an ongoing demand from protesters. Last year, City Council put forward $3 million in funding for a Community Safety Department, which would respond to some 911 calls, such as emergencies involving mental health crises, substance use disorder, and unhoused residents. Some advocates have also called on Cambridge to fund Holistic Emergency Alternative Response Team, a police alternative independent of the city’s emergency services.
Though protesters have repeatedly called for the release of the unredacted police report and for the officers involved in Faisal’s killing to be named, fired, and prosecuted, Huang reiterated that the names of the officers would not be released until the investigation by the Middlesex District Attorney’s Office concludes.
“I hope that we can recognize that our police officers sometimes face complex, difficult, and dangerous situations — and that there are cases where we can’t make an immediate judgment,” Huang wrote in the Tuesday release.
In a statement, CPD Commissioner Christine A. Elow wrote that CPD “has not identified any egregious misconduct or significant policy, training, equipment, or disciplinary violations.” The officer who shot Faisal is currently on paid administrative leave.
Suhail P. Purkar, an organizer with the Party for Socialism and Liberation who has been involved in several recent protests, wrote in an email that Huang’s latest commitments do not go far enough.
“It is disappointing and shameful that he didn’t agree to a single demand from the community,” Purkar wrote.
Purkar wrote he will continue to advocate for the demands demonstrators have continually voiced at protests.
“This movement is only growing and more people are joining in the hundreds,” Purkar added. “We will win Justice for Faisal and ensure this never happens again in Cambridge.”

A Harvard University Health Services physician was terminated last year after receiving several complaints from female patients aged 18 to 31 who alleged misconduct and inappropriate behavior during physical examinations.
Jeffrey R. Schapiro worked as an urgent care physician at HUHS from July 2018 until his dismissal in March 2022, following at least eight formal complaints from patients to HUHS in the span of a year. Schapiro has disputed the complainants’ interpretation of his actions and their severity in written statements and an interview with The Crimson.
According to now-impounded court documents obtained by The Crimson from a civil proceeding before the Massachusetts Superior Court in Middlesex County, the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine — which is responsible for licensing, regulating, and disciplining Massachusetts-based physicians — subpoenaed HUHS on May 4, 2022, for the unredacted and identifiable medical records of four of the complainants.
The records, which remain sealed, are required for the Board’s investigation of the practices and quality of care Schapiro provided, according to the court documents.
The subpoena drew resistance from HUHS, which objected to the release of the patients’ de-anonymized medical records on the basis of individual privacy concerns.
Despite opposition from HUHS, following a hearing, a Middlesex County Superior Court judge allowed the subpoena against HUHS to move forward in December, forcing the University’s health service to provide the Board with the students’ records and names under seal.
HUHS has raised privacy concerns with the release of the unredacted medical records, though the health service’s privacy policy as well as health and educational records privacy law allow for the release of records in response to lawful subpoenas.
Schapiro’s name is redacted in the court documents, which describe him as “John Doe.” Schapiro confirmed in an interview with The Crimson that he is the subject of the complaints and described many of them as “reasonably accurate accounts,” but he said his behavior was routine and misinterpreted.
“I do not believe I have ever examined anybody in a clinically irrelevant or not pertinent manner,” he said. “I think that is something that fully is not appreciated or not believed by some of the people who have made accusations towards me.”
Schapiro remains a fully licensed physician in Massachusetts, according to the Board’s website. As of Thursday, he has not been disciplined by the Board.
One of the complainants, who visited HUHS on Feb. 13, 2022, described her appointment with Schapiro as “a very bad experience” in the obtained court document containing patient satisfaction comments.
“He touched my right inner thigh during my first visit (not during my ankle exam, but while he was explaining next steps and I was sitting in the patient chair next to the computer and desk),” the anonymous complainant wrote.
The patient added that he made “weird, presumptive mumbling comments” after asking her if she could be pregnant and continued inappropriate behavior during her visit the next day.
“I had the sense during both visits that he was ‘hitting on me’ or something of the sort,” the patient wrote. “While he does not categorically assault women, I think that his conduct is highly unprofessional.”
In an emailed statement, Schapiro wrote that “any touching of the inner thigh was still part of the broader neurovascular evaluation” and that he asks “all women of childbearing age if pregnancy is a potential concern” before beginning an X-ray.
One woman wrote that the doctor was “weirdly touchy” and “would touch my back,” and another wrote she felt “unsafe and creeped out because he kept touching me.”
“I would not recommend this provider to any woman,” the complainant wrote. “The whole time I just had this gut feeling that I was in danger and I needed to get out of there.”
Schapiro wrote that he does “get close to all patients, regardless of gender” for examinations and to go over written instructions with them.
“I am very proud of my efforts to communicate fully and openly with patients and am quite distraught to be learning now for the very first time that this well intentioned practice was actually being perceived as being too intrusive by some patients,” he wrote.
Five of the eight complaints explicitly mentioned inappropriate touching, three expressed concerns over his medical practices, and two alleged inappropriate comments during exams.
In one of the complaints about Schapiro’s medical procedures, a patient wrote that she was concerned that he did not initially use lubricant gel during a pelvic exam when swabbing her for bacterial vaginosis.
“When I expressed that it hurt, [he] did not move hastily to take it out,” wrote the complainant.
Schapiro wrote that he does not typically use lubricant because it makes diagnosis via microscope slides more difficult, adding that he was “certainly not attempting to be cruel.”
“I did not like to use lubricant to obtain the sample for the microscope because the lubricant distorted the appearance of the slide and made the accurate diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, in particular, quite challenging,” he wrote.
Schapiro said he does not believe he has been “treated fairly” by HUHS officials.
“This was not a heinous crime that I committed. These were minor issues. I was not perfect in my behavior. I did touch somebody. I acknowledge that,” Schapiro said.
Schapiro wrote in a follow-up comment that he had never seen any of the patient satisfaction complaints provided to the Board and that he continues to believe his behavior was appropriate and consistent with “medically indicated” examinations.
“I find this failure to make me aware of the accusations quite negligent and perhaps malicious on the part of the Harvard administration,” Schapiro wrote. “I had no opportunity to respond to the specific complaints, either to defend myself against false or exaggerated reports or to appreciate that some of my habitual practices, performed in an effort to provide good medical care, were being perceived as inappropriate.”
“I sincerely believe that none of these complaints provides evidence of malicious or inappropriate behavior,” he added.
HUHS spokesperson Cherrelle L. Norris declined to comment on Schapiro’s criticisms, citing policy against commenting on personnel matters.
Following the complaints, HUHS put Schapiro on leave on Feb. 18, 2022, but according to an email from HUHS to Schapiro, he attended grand rounds — a remote medical seminar — and continued to contact colleagues.
“You utilized the electronic medical record and sent multiple messages to other HUHS providers and issued orders for patients,” HUHS wrote to Schapiro. “In addition, you were insubordinate to Dr. [Redacted] during grand rounds by refusing to leave despite his instruction to do so.”
Schapiro said in an interview that he was not initially made aware of the terms of his administrative leave and complied with the leave after he was advised that he had violated its rules.
“It was not something that I had been advised that I shouldn’t do,” Schapiro said of attending grand rounds. “I had no idea of what administrative leave was, except the fact that I wasn’t going to come into work and see patients.”
In a Feb. 20, 2022, email, Schapiro wrote to HUHS saying that he was “clearly at fault in one of the complaints.”
“While I had no lascivious or solicitous intentions, I without question placed my unappreciated hand on one patient’s knee multiple times,” Schapiro wrote in the email. “The touching took place outside of my exam and was well-meaning but unprofessional. She made me aware at the time that my hand was unwelcome and I acknowledged her discomfort.”
Schapiro also wrote in the email that he was shocked by “the revelation that I was the provider who generated the most complaints in the health center.”
On March 4, 2022, Schapiro was terminated by HUHS in a letter which named a “violation of Harvard and HUHS policies” as the reason for his dismissal.
The letter also referenced two additional complaints, including an allegation that he told a patient, “If you keep coming back, people might talk about us.”
Schapiro said in an interview that he had seen the patient who leveled the complaint on three separate, unscheduled visits, which he said he thought was a “strange phenomenon.” He said his comment was “not a solicitation.”
Schapiro added that the letter misquoted him and that he told the patient, “We have to stop meeting like this, people might start talking.”
“This is more a reflection on the perception of the outside world that you can’t have an innocuous encounter three times or so,” Schapiro said in the interview. “The tendency is for other people to jump to conclusions.”
Schapiro said he views HUHS’ decision to terminate him as “swift and drastic,” adding that he believes the University’s health service “overreacted” to his conduct due to controversy over other high-profile investigations of professional misconduct at Harvard.
In recent years, several Harvard academics — including African and African American Studies and Anthropology professor John L. Comaroff, Economics professor Roland G. Fryer Jr., and Government professor Jorge I. Domínguez — have faced sexual misconduct allegations and subsequent investigations.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton and HUHS spokesperson Norris did not comment on Schapiro’s criticisms of Harvard’s misconduct procedures.
The Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine also declined to comment on their open investigation into Schapiro’s quality of care.
“This has been devastating to my career,” Schapiro said. “I don’t know what to expect. Potential employers don’t know what to expect, and it makes me an undesirable candidate.”
HUHS’ March dismissal of Schapiro triggered a notification to the National Practitioner Data Bank, a database operated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that contains records of medical malpractice and other misconduct. The notice prompted the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine to begin an investigation into Schapiro’s medical care, according to court documents.
The Board first issued HUHS a subpoena on April 5, 2022, for Schapiro’s employment records. HUHS complied with the initial order, but on May 4, the Board subpoenaed HUHS for medical records containing identifying information of four of the patients whose complaints appeared in the employment file.
HUHS resisted the subpoena of student medical records, citing education and health records privacy laws, and instead offered to provide copies of the records with all identifying information redacted.
“HUHS will not comply with the May 4, 2022 subpoena as it is an illegal and unwarranted invasion into the privacy of the students,” Ingrid S. Martin, an attorney for HUHS, wrote on June 24.
“We do not believe that HUHS can legally provide these materials to you in an unredacted form, nor do we see any exigent need by the Board that would justify such an invasion of the four students’ personal and medical privacy,” Martin wrote.
But the Board rejected HUHS’ offer to provide redacted documents, arguing that they needed the patients’ records in order to adequately investigate Schapiro “for potential substandard or inappropriate care.” On Aug. 11, the Board filed a civil action against HUHS in the Middlesex Superior Court to compel them to provide unredacted documents in support of their investigation.
HUHS opposed the motion in an Aug. 26 filing, writing that the Board often evaluates a doctor’s quality of care based on redacted documents.
“It seems likely that the Board’s true intent is to try to contact the four female patients and to interview them,” HUHS’ filing read. “As HUHS has made clear, such an outreach, which would ask these patients to relive the trauma of their experiences again, is unnecessary and unreasonable in this case because Dr. Doe has already admitted to the underlying misconduct.”
Months later, on Dec. 12, Middlesex Superior Court Judge Brent A. Tingle ruled in favor of the Board, compelling HUHS to release the sealed, but unredacted, medical records.
“After review and hearing this motion is allowed where the Board is a healthcare oversight organization as defined in HIPAA and where FERPA requires production of the requested patient records in response to a lawful subpoena and notice to the patients,” Tingle wrote.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and FERPA, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, regulate privacy practices for medical records and educational records, respectively. Both FERPA and HIPAA allow for the disclosure of records without consent due to a subpoena or judicial order.
Lawyer Steven D. Zansberg, who has written about FERPA, said HIPAA is more relevant to the students’ medical records.
“The statute that applies here is not FERPA, but HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which is a federal statute that protects patient records from public inspection, and imposes penalties on the medical care providers for wrongfully disclosing such records,” he said.
According to a 2019 HUHS privacy practices document, HUHS can disclose medical information without written consent for reasons including health oversight activities, lawsuits and disputes, and law enforcement.
Norris, the HUHS spokesperson, wrote in an emailed statement that patient confidentiality is an essential part of providing health care.
“A judge has clarified what the Board of Registration in Medicine may legally obtain from HUHS, and we are fully cooperating with the process and have notified the patients prior to any disclosure,” Norris wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s and women’s track and field teams ran historic races and set new records for events this past weekend. The Crimson competed at the Clemson Tiger Paw Invite at Clemson University and the Valentine Invitational at Boston University over February 10 and 11, and the team saw great success.
“The [two meets] that the team competed in this past weekend were two of the five most competitive, most anticipated meets of the indoor track season in the country,” junior Lance Ward said. “We stepped up and performed at that high level.”
Up first, the throwers and pole vaulters posted a dominant performance at the BU Valentine Invitational.
Sophomore Anastasia Retsa won the women’s pole vault event, setting a new school record in the process. Retsa set a mark of 4.17 m, making her the only vaulter to surpass the 3.90 m mark at the entire meet. Senior Estel Valeanu improved on her previous personal bests in the throwing events. She first won the shot put event, throwing a mark of 13.93 m that bumped her up to third place in the Harvard record books. She then secured another victory in the weight throw event as well, throwing the first place mark of 19.08 m, which was also good enough to get third place in the Harvard record books.
On the track, the Crimson smashed school and Ivy records.
Sophomore Graham Blanks secured his third Harvard and Ivy League record with his 7:44.76 second run in the 3000 m. The time earned him second place in a field of 219 runners. Junior Acer Iverson was right behind him, running a personal best of 7:47.74 seconds, which puts him in second place in the Harvard and Ivy League record books. First-year Vivien Henz, who just set the Luxembourg indoor mile record at the Scarlet and White meet this past week, earned himself another record. The Valentine Invitational set the record for the most men to run a mile under four minutes at one meet with 52, doubling the previous record of 26. Henz was a part of the mix, running a 3:57.87.
When it comes to the records the Crimson are breaking, the team is looking to surpass the previous number broken in a season.
“Last year we set a record in terms of how many records we broke, which was around 20, counting both indoor and outdoor seasons,” Ward said. “But this year, we’re on pace to crush that as well. I think we’re up to the mid to high teens of records being broken this indoor season alone, so it’s pretty exciting.”
At the Clemson Tiger Paw Invite, Harvard continued to set historic marks.
Ward beat his previous school record in the indoor 200 m race, running a time of 21.07 seconds. The time was the best he ever ran in the event, indoor or outdoor.
“It was pretty awesome,” said Ward about his record breaking race. “The meet at Clemson had a crazy atmosphere. There were tons of big schools, lots of top ten times were run in the NCAA at that meet, so the environment was just electric. When the time came, I was just like, you gotta kind of trust it.”
Sophomore Victoria Bossong ran a 2:08.81 second 800 m, which was enough to bump her up to eighth all time in the Harvard record books.
“This meet was the first competition during our indoor season where we had fantastic competition surrounding us,” said Bossong. “Our coach’s advice was to take advantage of the opportunity presented to us and to compete with intensity and heart.”
The meet ended with the Crimson’s women 4x400 team setting a new school and Ivy League record in the event, running a 3:34.17 to beat the previous record by almost a second. The team included Bossong, sophomore Izzy Goudros, senior Tina Martin, and sophomore Chloe Fair.
One of the biggest motivations for the success the team has had is the community and bond the team maintains.
“I’m just fortunate to be able to train alongside those other awesome athletes,” Ward reflected. “We really push each other in practice. When that translates to success on the track, we all celebrate that with each other.”
Looking towards the Ivy League Indoor Championships, Harvard is looking to be competitive with the rest of the teams in the Ivy League, especially their biggest competitor, the Princeton Tigers.
“The women’s team is ranked 20th in the country right now, and they’re looking to annihilate the rest of the Ivy League at indoor championships,” said Ward. “I think they’re very equipped and ready to do that. The men’s team is pretty neck and neck with Princeton this year, and we’re looking to topple them. I think we can. I think I know this program can accomplish that if everything goes right.”
Next up, Harvard competes at the Alex Wilson Invitational at Notre Dame on February 18, which will be their last regular season meet. Their indoor season commences with the Ivy League Championships the following weekend.

So to celebrate this momentous occasion, here’s a playlist full of sun-inspired bops to enjoy on your walk to class. Listen hard, but don’t listen too hard. The last thing we want is a good jinx sending a mountain of snow to dump on us next week.
