After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What do Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg have in common? Other than serving time, these long-time friends share a passion for food and entertainment. It is of little surprise then that they are the hosts of VH1’s latest show, “Martha & Snoop’s Potluck Dinner Party”. While this show might appear to be a bizarre venture, its premiere episode proved to be entertainment genius and one of the most enjoyable ways of learning to cook.
In the premiere episode, Martha and Snoop battled it out to see who could make the best fried chicken, tapping actor Seth Rogen and rappers Ice Cube and Wiz Khalifa to be the judges of their friendly competition. This star-studded fest was peppered with a joviality and sharp repartee that made it much more exciting than the usual Food Network cooking show. Snoop prepared his very own potato chip fried chicken with Rogen, while Martha and Wiz (as she endearingly calls him) prepared a much more demanding traditional buttermilk variation. Wiz, ever the gracious guest, brought his hostess a gift basket of rather suspicious-looking homegrown green herbs which he helpfully sprinkled into the batter to tingle the taste buds. Needless to say, Martha and Snoop Dogg appreciated the gesture.
Unlike other shows, “Potluck” presents the perfect balance between cooking and discussion. Though the hosts appear to be polar opposites in terms of personality and background, it was the juxtaposition of these two and the reversal of their stereotypes that made the episode so unexpectedly delightful. Naturally, plenty of the jokes centered on weed, but most of them were delivered by Martha. Her dry and blunt (no pun intended) humor formed the perfect contrast to Snoop’s more relaxed quips. She even went so far as to add her own “bling” to her usual uniform of J. Crew and Brooks Brothers—if one would go so far as to count a single necklace as bling. At first, it was rather astounding to hear her puns and innuendos, especially as Rogen so lovingly commented: “If there is one person who knows how to make shit whiter, it’s Martha Stewart.”  Ultimately, it was refreshing to witness this masthead of WASP culture and tradition finding her inner “hood.” Snoop Dogg, on the other hand, proved to be as equally versed in cooking as he is in rap. There was something about him sipping vodka cocktails and marinating chicken that screamed Stepford wife, in the best possible sense. His ease in the kitchen also made one wonder: Why hasn’t he had a cooking show before?
Along with their duties as chefs, the duo played the effective talk show hosts by making their guests participate in an informative round of Two Lies and a Truth, aptly called Two Thighs and a Truth. (Spoiler: Ice Cube did go to architectural drafting school). The show rounded off with a lively performance by rapper Anderson .Paak, in which the audience saw Snoop and guests break into some impromptu dancing. Regrettably, Martha did not join in.
Judging from this first one, the rest of the episodes in the series promises to be equally as charming and humorous, with a lot more delicious recipes, booze and special guests. I, for one, cannot wait until the next episode.

There is a certain tragedy when—despite the saying that you can pick your friends but you can’t pick your family—a young girl cannot choose her friends. Restrained by hierarchical social systems at school, caged inside changing bodies, suffocated by parents, young girls often have to deal with not only choosing with whom to be friends but also being unable to be friends with those they like. Such is the predicament in which the narrator in Zadie Smith’s fifth novel finds herself as a child; she is jealous of her best friend, Tracey, who represents everything she desires. Little does the main character—who remains unnamed—know that she too represents what Tracey dreams of having. Spanning several decades of the main character’s life, the story follows her as she grows under the shadow of the Tracey and the two other women who rule over different aspects of her life, whether by her choice or not: her Jamaican mother and her celebrity of a boss, Aimee. Smith jumps between different periods of her main character’s life to paint a slow-forming but sincere mosaic of her identity, relationships, and sense of self; though the novel addresses issues of race and womanhood, it nevertheless represents a platform through which anyone can connect with the main character.
The narrator’s relationship to the three important women in her life is central to the novel, and their importance hinges on Smith’s uncanny ability to reveal the layers that both make up common ground and make two people fundamentally different. Tracey and the narrator, for example, are both biracial with the same skin tone, but their experiences as mixed children are completely different. The failure in the relationship lies in their mutual jealousy for the other’s situation without realizing each is the epitome of what the other envies. “‘With everyone else it’s the dad,’ [Tracey] said, and because I knew this to be more or less accurate I could think of nothing more to say. ‘When your dad’s white it means—’” Had Tracey finished her sentence, she might have said, “stability, comfort, presence,”which is exactly what the narrator had that Tracey didn’t: a white father who didn’t neglect his responsibilities to his daughter. Meanwhile, the narrator is jealous of Tracey’s freedom and maturity, failing to realize that Tracey is free and mature because she has had no other choice but to be, growing up with a single white mother and a constantly-imprisoned black father.
Similarly, Smith gracefully describes the narrator’s complex struggles with her relationship to her mother, a Jamaican immigrant whose ideals simply do not overlap with her daughter’s, to the detriment of their relationship. Where her mother wants her to go to the best schools, the narrator fails her entry exams and pushes to audition for a dance school, like Tracey; where her mother wants her to settle down and build a concrete life for herself, the narrator travels around the world, never belonging in any one place and wading through life in the shadow of her boss. While her mother tries to teach her how other people live, the pair lack common ground due to a disconnect that ultimately denies the two the possibility of mutual understanding:  “‘...Poverty is not just a headline, my love, it’s a lived reality, on the ground—and education is at the heart of it.’ [said my mother]. ‘I know what poverty is, Mum.’ [I replied]. My mother smiled sadly, and bit down on a forkful of food. ‘No, dear, you don’t.’” It is precisely this beautifully portrayed distance that causes the narrator to grow up too fast, as well as to constantly seek female guidance and connection to no avail. Searching for a mother but finding none in her eccentric boss, Aimee, the narrator becomes one of the “tragic heroes who have no choices before them, no alternative routes, only unavoidable fates,” like the one she eventually faces.
A book centered around relationships and race is no novelty in Smith’s bibliography, and yet her dedication to changing the way she tells stories from novel to novel is what makes her so deserving of the praise she has received. Her attempts at innovation within her own repertoire of styles not only coincide with but also complement and enhance the content of whatever story she is trying to tell. While Smith employed both first- and third-person narration in “NW”, “Swing Time” marks the first time Smith writes completely in the first person. Furthermore, Smith’s refusal to name her narrator allows her to redefine the things that characterize a person; a name is central to anyone’s identity, but not here. For what is a person’s name compared to her life, memories, relationships, thoughts, and ignorance?
“Swing Time” may be her fifth novel, but Smith is far from losing her edge. This book, perhaps more so than all of her previous novels, succeeds in its attempt to touch others. Be it race; relationships with friends, family, or coworkers; heartbreak; or attempting to find yourself, there is something in “Swing Time” that any reader will be able to identify with, especially because Smith provides a way to connect through a lack of connection. Two very similar people on paper can live completely different lives, while two people who seemingly have nothing in common might actually understand each other best. Like the dance at which Tracey excels, the dance the narrator can only dream of being good at, Smith’s words have a movement in them that allows Smith to capture the essence of the subtle intricacies of life.

In her newest collection of prose, poetry, and essays, “The Needle’s Eye,” National Book Award finalist Fanny Howe delves into definitions of adolescence, a universal period of perpetual uncertainty and self-discovery. Through experimental language, Howe examines our collective societal relationship with the “struggle on the part of a youth to transcend and escape the ugly fate of adults,” recontextualizing youth in both contemporary tales and stories faded by the passage of time. Howe’s writing dovetails inventive format with original technique, unified by a topical theme, in an enriching and visceral reading experience.
Howe subverts what might otherwise be blandly erudite anecdotes, infusing them with an emotionally resonant vitality. The poem “In Prism” draws upon the story of the medieval saints Francis and Clare of Assisi, who become vivid characters in a complicated historical narrative. The writing draws upon many historical, artistic, and literary sources, with varied references ranging from Nathaniel Hawthorne to Lionel Rogosin’s documentary “On the Bowery” to the Upanishads. While this blend can sometimes make for a jarring experience, it is also thrilling to embark on a narrative journey that jumps from era to era. In one instant, we travel alongside the medieval romance of Francis and Clare; in the next, we examine the upbringing of the Tsarnaev brothers, responsible for the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. The latter story is controversial, but Howe has a unique capacity for humanizing those with deviant psychologies as much as she can humanize those who have faded in the hazy depths of obscurity, who would otherwise be one-off mentions in a history textbook.
Howe’s writing transcends not only the limitations of time but also those of genre, surpassing limits of conventional form and structure. Her experimental language, though sometimes verging on the inaccessible, creates complex stories with layers of nuance to parse through. “I met a person who could taste the grass and herbs a beast had eaten in the meat on her plate,” she writes in “F Plus.” “I only taste my tongue in a leaf of lettuce, a strawberry.”  Other sections, though, prove more emotionally accessible to the quotidian reader. “How strange it is to grow from childhood, to have to discard your clothes, now tight and short,” Howe writes in “The Child’s Child,” “like Alice to find yourself bending where once you were tiny. To rise higher than the knees of your father, to watch your fingers and shoes lengthen.”
Memory and human perception also play a thought-provoking role in “The Needle’s Eye.” Howe questions the legitimacy of human perception in shaping the objective truth. In “On the Bowery,” Howe cites the work of Innokenty Annensky, a Russian poet, who writes, “To the human brain, a hallucination is the exact same thing as seeing the world just as it is.” The human memory, Howe suggests, will never be quite as adequate as the experience of reality in the present. “Memories blink and flash and capture moments of the past in sepia and gray, like the glimpse of a distant place, far beyond where you are standing,” she writes. “The distance, like the past, is blurred. Kids and old people forget about keys and phones and scarves and pills, because these are not primal needs but secondary to the animal who is half asleep in us. They join like shadows at the end of the day.”
“The Needle’s Eye” sounds experimental enough to be incoherent, yet Howe narrowly evades an overly disconnected reading experience by infusing each prose-poem with ties to relevant counterparts in the rest of the collection. Working deftly with symbolism and motif, Howe links each piece through subtle, thematic connections. The repeated image of pure gold and the mirror, for example, links the stories of Francis and Clare to modern psychological case studies. And the underlying theme of societal treatment of women and girls proves relevant to stories as eclectic as that of Alina Tsarnaeva, younger sister of the Tsarnaev brothers (in “Alina Tsarnaeva”), as well as that of Greek nymphs (in “Nymphs Without Names”). These logical ties facilitate the drawing of connections, unifying separate chapters in one cohesive work of writing.
Perhaps what infuses “The Needle’s Eye” with such presence, such urgency, is its tendency to draw existential questions from historical anecdotes. In “Like Grown-ups,” an account of French philosopher Simone Weil, Howe questions, “What could the value of one human person be among hordes of others? What would make a single individual matter in a vast and uprooted world? Why not silence or step on anyone who gets in your way?” In the same page, Howe references Rossellini’s “Europa ‘51” to provide an answer to the existential question, an eloquent line that resonates deeply. “There is something that goes on indomitably expecting, in the teeth of all experience of crimes committed, suffered, and witnessed, that good and not evil will be done,” she writes. “It is this above all that is sacred in every human being.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this year, I was adamant in my decision to avoid publicly participating in political discourse. The ugliness of the presidential race, combined with the animosity and arrogance that still dominates most online forums, led me to dread politics, a topic that once enthralled my younger self. However, last Tuesday’s result and the ensuing wave of rage that continues to engulf social media have finally convinced me to emerge from my hole.  
Despite the interconnectedness that the proliferation of social media supposedly fosters, it seems that most people willfully lock themselves in online echo chambers. Students share eloquent posts on Facebook addressed to the public yet accessible only to their friends and allies. Our classmates suggest articles that support a particular view, and our newsfeeds guide us towards opinions, groups, and memes that align with our preconceived notions of right and wrong. As such, each of us strongly holds that we represent the “correct” side of history. As a Democrat myself, I believe our groupthink and hubris compromised our ability to wage an effective campaign and, more importantly, led us to mistakenly dismiss Trump as a joke.
In the prelude to last Tuesday’s election, Clinton’s victory seemed inevitable—or at least according to my newsfeed. Polls and pundits spoke of the election as all but determined, and their certainty was only matched by our confidence in our belief that liberalism represented the future, dominant political culture.
Our confidence is reflected in the way that we seek out our conservative compatriots—not to debate, but rather to humiliate them. We take pride in flagging down racists on campus, on calling out others on their privilege for all to bear witness to our newfound awareness on Facebook. Social activism threatens to become a spectacle of sorts, with everyone attempting to prove the sincerity of their struggle.
For years, college campuses created the illusion that conservative philosophy was dying. In outnumbering our Republican brethren, we liberals mistook the college cultural imbalance for a larger, nonexistent trend—that America’s population was more liberal than conservative. Meanwhile, political entrepreneurs took advantage of our zeal, portraying our efforts—sometimes accurately—as the product of liberalism’s hubris and disdain for our “bigoted” opponents. Rather than represent the party of the people, liberals were seen as a privileged class of naggers whose primary form of service was the belittlement of our countrymen.
Of course, some Democrats may feel as though these accusations are unfair. After all, social activism plays an important role in eliciting political change. When fighting oppressive systems, confrontational techniques understandably seem the most effective. However, even our best intentions are largely irrelevant when discussing our country’s political process. Elections determine who holds power, not the truth. As such, our political correctness doesn’t matter as much as our reputations in the eyes of those whose political loyalties remain uncertain. Lest we forget, witch hunts only work when you outnumber the witches, and as was demonstrated last Tuesday, conservatism is far from dead.
Our eagerness to abolish the term “House Master,” whilst Eliot and Lowell House retain the namesakes of a eugenicist and an anti-Semite, respectively, seems hypocritical at best. For the privileged, white class of college liberals, social activism has devolved into another trend, a cause to take up when one’s campus deems it popular.
A member of the Wu-Tang Clan gets a single vote. The disgruntled, middle-aged, formerly employed white male mechanic gets a single vote. No matter who you are, you only get one vote. So in order to win an election, a candidate needs to convince as many citizens as possible that his or her cause is just. And yet, despite this seemingly simply requirement, college liberals seem more concerned with looking smart at the expense of conservatives, rather than persuading the opposition or coming to an understanding.
I understand the appeal of smugness; the intoxication provided by satirizing your opponents whilst your friends and allies laugh proves empowering. However, as I stated in an earlier piece, this past election taught me that, in all my years of ranting, I have yet to convince a single conservative to join the Democratic cause. Whether we like it or not, educating others requires a conversation, not a self-righteous sermon.
Many argue that it shouldn’t fall on the oppressed to explain their suffering, particularly to those who take part in perpetuating their oppression. But Native Americans shouldn’t have to explain the political and cultural mechanisms through which they’re marginalized. And veterans shouldn’t have to explain the manners in which the VA continuously leaves their comrades out to dry. Immigrants shouldn’t have to repeatedly prove the humanity of their loved ones. However, we don’t live in a world that embodies our egalitarian ideals; instead, we inhabit a world that demands deep, personal sacrifice. Educating others will certainly prove exhausting, but such is the nature of necessary work. If you don’t educate others, no one else will.
I’m not condemning those who express fear or rage online in the wake of this election. If anything, I share their fright. Come late January, Trump will assume his place as my president, and for those of us in uniform, the term “Commander in Chief” represents something far more literal. Furthermore, I don’t want to dismiss the discriminatory elements embodied by the actions of Trump, as well as those of many who voted for him. However, the calls on social media to “unfriend” and stigmatize Trump supporters only serve to further mobilize the right to vote against the very same causes we hold so dear.
The future of the Democratic Party lies within the quality of our political counterattack. If we redouble our efforts and focus on convincing our opponents that our cause is not only just, but also accessible to all Americans, then the Democratic Party still has a future. However, if we instead choose to further isolate ourselves from those we disagree with, then our political suicide is all but complete.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the two weeks since the presidential election, immigrants—documented and undocumented alike—are grappling with the possibility that they will be deported from the country under a Trump administration. For these people, the existence of sanctuary cities is a saving grace.
Sanctuary cities, like Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville, are cities that don't generally cooperate with federal immigration authorities except in cases involving violent criminals. In line with his proposed stringent immigration policy, President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to go after these sanctuary cities, of which Massachusetts boasts six. So far, Boston and Somerville are standing firm against Trump, vowing to remain safe havens.
Given that the cities of Cambridge and Boston are engaging in dialogue surrounding the safety of immigrants in this country, we think it important to consider the role that Harvard can play in doing the same. In recent weeks, universities have grafted the idea of the “sanctuary city” onto campuses, and we believe that Harvard should pursue this idea. Despite the upcoming change in presidential administration, Harvard’s commitment to taking care of its students regardless of their immigration status should not change.
We are concerned that immigration regulations might change under Trump, and we hope that Harvard would combat any changes made with the purpose of rendering it more difficult for undocumented students to stay in this country. Though the administration certainly has not always reacted quickly to the demands of Harvard’s undocumented students, we are heartened to see that a general trend leans toward administrative support for the protection of undocumented students on this campus, especially in the current political climate.
At Harvard and beyond, the issue of immigrants’ safety in this country transcends politics—it is a human rights issue. Immigration detention conditions are often poor, and immigrants sent to them often only escape by being deported to dangerous countries. Meanwhile, in non-sanctuary cities, the fear of being caught de-incentivizes immigrants from reporting serious crimes that they witness or suffer for fear of deportation. Needless to say, students at Harvard should not need to worry about being sent to a detention center with inhumane accommodations or even fear deportation while trying to pursue an education.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The nation's highest glass ceiling didn't shatter on November 8th. Many of us hoped it would. Many of us waited with bated breath, ready to hear the sound of millions of tiny glass shards crashing down, ready to bask in the sight of a limitless blue sky stretching up above, ready to live in a world where a woman can be President of the United States.
It looks like we have some more waiting to do. And in the meantime, many people, especially men, have been quick to blame Hillary Clinton’s defeat on the fact that she was a “weak candidate.” But what they fail to understand is that in a world so misogynistic, for a woman to even come close to shattering the glass ceiling is a superhuman feat of resilience and strength, and a testament to Hillary Clinton's unstoppable willpower in the face of male dominance.
It’s not just Hillary Clinton: Many women who dare to exist in the public sphere are deemed transgressive and punished accordingly. When Leslie Jones dared to speak up against the criticism of the “Ghostbusters” reboot, she was verbally assaulted with racist and sexist slurs by Milo Yiannopoulous and the alt-right community, which then went on to leak her private documents and nude photographs. When Anita Sarkeesian dared to talk about the sexist portrayal of women in video games, she was attacked by Gamergate, a loosely organized movement of anonymous Internet harassers, who promised to shoot anyone that showed up to Sarkeesian’s talk at Utah State University and who threatened to “come to your house and violently rape you in front of your family.” When Jessica Valenti dared to write about feminism, she received rape and death threats directed at her 5-year old daughter.
And just in case you think these are empty threats or that feminists are getting “triggered” for no reason, you might remember the story of Jyoti Singh, who was riding a bus in Delhi with her male friend when she was viciously attacked by six men, beaten, gang-raped, and violently assaulted with a rusty iron rod causing her to die two weeks later from internal damage—all because “a decent girl won’t roam around after 9 o’clock at night.” You might remember the story of Qandeel Baloch, a social media celebrity who embraced her sexuality and talked about the role of women in society, recently strangled to death by her own brother because “girls are born to stay home.”
This is all caused by fragile masculinity, by men who have been raised to conform to a construction of manhood that emphasizes dominance and aggression. It is fragile masculinity that tells men that the only way they can be a man is by being aggressive, stoic, and competitive. It is fragile masculinity that instills in men a crushing fear of being seen as “gay” or “girly,” and drives them to reassert their dominance by lashing out in misogynistic and homophobic violence.
But masculinity is a fragile thing. So fragile that, no doubt, even this simple statement will be threatening—dare I say, “triggering”—to many male readers. So fragile that bath bombs marketed for men need to be shaped like grenades, rose gold iPhones are considered strictly off-limits unless they call it “bro's gold,” male body spray comes in fragrances like “really ripped abs,” shower loofahs need to be specifically labeled “men’s mesh sponge,” and even chocolate needs to be aggressively labeled “Man Chocolate,” lest the men purchasing any of these items run the risk of being called “gay” or “girly.” So fragile that the mere prospect of Hillary Clinton becoming President of the United States was able to galvanize the alt-right movement to spew vitriol against her and motivate so many male voters to vote against her.
For Clinton was a woman who not only dared to exist in the public sphere, but dared to run for and occupy a position of power in a world that has been male-dominated. And for those transgressions, she has been punished, over and over again. From when she ran for president in high school to when she applied to law school and throughout her career in public service, she has been subjected to a relentless stream of sexist attacks and unfair double standards. As Anthony Williams, creator of the #MasculinitySoFragile hashtag, pointed out: “When you challenge masculinity, it hits a nerve.” And as a powerful female politician, Hillary Clinton’s mere existence shakes masculinity to its very core.
Donald Trump's victory, therefore, was nothing more than a desperate attempt by scared heterosexual, cisgender white men, fearful and resentful as they watched the hegemony they have enjoyed for decades slowly crumble away, because once upon a time the whole world was their safe space and the whole world was their “locker room.” Now that marginalized communities like women, people of color, the BGLTQ community, and undocumented immigrants are asserting their rights and creating their own safe spaces and even running for President, they are terrified because “when you’re accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression”—and so, they lashed out by electing an openly racist and misogynistic, heterosexual, cisgender white man who has drawn praise from the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis, and white nationalist groups.
Because even they know that the glass ceiling cannot withstand many more blows, and that when it finally gives way, their fragile constructions of masculinity will be shattering as well. And even now they can hear the slow but relentless trickle as splinters of glass come steadily raining down on them, reminding them that “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.”

The Copenhagen Wheel is a futuristic product of the Cambridge-based company Superpedestrian. Born in MIT’s Senseable City Labs, the wheel was created as an entry for a competition run by the city of Copenhagen to encourage biking.
The Wheel can be retrofitted into an existing bicycle by adding a 17-pound red disk to the back wheel of an ordinary bike. Not only is it an interesting style statement; the disk also contains a motor, sensors, and a battery. It links up to an app created by Superpedestrian, called My Wheel.
What makes the Wheel so “super?” While you’re pedalling, the motor augments your speed, so attaining and maintaining high velocities is a piece of cake. The app controls how much juice the motor ouputs, and lets you keep track of battery life, speed, and distance travelled.
Superpedestrian is currently allowing anyone to rent one of their bikes, equipped with a Copenhagen Wheel, for test spins. For $15, I was given access to a bike from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. It only took five minutes to get set up when I arrived at their headquarters, which are located southwest of MIT.
Starting to ride the bike from a standstill is shockingly easy. When the app is set to “turbo,” the motor immediately kicks in and starts helping you move the moment your feet engage the pedals. Used to a normal bike, I kicked off and pressed down hard, only to find myself already halfway down the street.
On “turbo,” the wheel is capable of accelerating the bike up to 20 mph. The motor could probably handle faster speeds, but then this “bike” would have to be officially classified as a motorcycle. As I lack a driver’s license of any kind, I was grateful for the speed cap.
Still, 20 mph is awfully fast. As I zipped through Cambridge, I found myself able to keep pace with cars on side streets, and rarely felt the need to pull over to allow one to pass. It felt as if some ethereal hand was holding me by the fender and steadily pushing me forward as I pedalled.
All of this power does come at a cost, though: In a half hour, I had drained about 20 percent of my battery life. I’ll pretend that this is the reason I pulled over to switch my motor’s output to “standard” on the app, but, truth be told, I was starting to get a little scared. Going fast is one thing—going fast over Cambridge’s pothole-happy streets is another.
On “standard,” my speed fell closer to the normal range of a bicycle, and I no longer felt like I was being literally pushed along by the motor. But I did notice that after another half hour of riding I hadn’t even broken a sweat, despite doing my best to go up and down as many challenging hills as possible. It almost felt like cheating. I suppose in many ways, it was.
The app also allows you to turn the wheel completely off. This turns your bike back into a normal bike, albeit with a 17-pound red weight attached. You can also switch to “exercise” mode, which makes the motor work against you. When riding in turbo or standard, you can charge the battery by pedalling backwards, like braking in a car.
The Copenhagen Wheel is currently on sale for preorder for $1,199. If you rent the bike for a day and fill out a survey, you’ll get a coupon for $50 off. Of course, it costs $15 to get this deal. $1,164 is still a little too price-y for this rider, but trying out the wheel is cheap and exciting. Cambridge has never felt so small from on top of a bicycle seat.

News playing out on a screen often carries a distant weight. We hear about the human rights abuses of the Syrian refugee crisis. We see the photos of overfilled boats, of thousands of people crowding the shores of Greek beaches.
Then our phones buzz at us, telling us we have to go to that meeting or write that paper. And we run off, seamlessly enveloped back into our busy lives.
Baraa Kouja is trying to get Westerners to  understand the reality of the Syrian refugee crisis. This week, his art exhibition “From Syria with Love” stopped by Harvard’s campus to help bridge the gap.
The exhibition is tiny. It occupies one wall inside Harvard Law School’s Austin Hall. Nevertheless, it is dizzying and colorful; it has its own way of drawing Syria closer to viewers. The drawings that line the wall have all been created by refugee children as a way to “express their feelings and emotions through art,” Kouja says. “Some of them are promising and hopeful, some of them are tragic… they all are powerful.”
Kouja, originally from Aleppo, founded a nonprofit organization—also called From Syria With Love—a year ago, while living in the UK. According to Kouja, the organization doesn’t take money for management and administration fees, and forwards all donations to refugee camps in Europe. Kouja has traveled the world leading talks and presenting the exhibition.
“From Syria With Love” is built upon four main pillars: Education, Empowerment, Emergency, and Relief. Kouja’s organization sponsors school tents for refugee children. It provides emergency response and relief, including accommodations like wheelchairs. The organization also funds workshops that help refugees build valuable life skills and gain self-confidence.
The exhibition’s artwork offers viewers a glimpse into refugee children’s lives. Each piece is accompanied by an ID card, which features the artist’s name, age, and picture. One boy, Zahar Al-Omar, has drawn a picture of two opposing worlds. In one, missiles rain down on dead children. The sky is dark, the ground red. The other half of the drawing is light, in bright blues and purples. Happy-looking people hold bundles of balloons.
Another image stands out. Two girls, one in pink and the other in blue, sit crouched on the ground, shielding their eyes with their arms. Donha Khalil, the artist, is 13 years old.

Over the past year, Kouja’s efforts have yielded significant results. “This art exhibition has toured more than 25 destinations in the UK and been to France, San Francisco, and now Harvard University,” he says. After taking off in the UK, From Syria With Love has raised more than $30,000 in less than a year, according to Kouja.
Looking at the survivors’ drawings and their simultaneously hopeful and desperate words, viewers may be reminded of their own childhood drawings. Simple shapes, scribbled letters, and crayon outlines of wonder and terror mark the pieces of paper. They make the refugee crisis feel closer to home than you’d expect.

I stood in the AT&T store looking down at the broken husk of my phone. Every few seconds the screen would flicker valiantly before extinguishing once again, emitting a sad, slow buzz in the process.
“How many photos did you say it was again?”
It was 4,000. The small device gasping for breath on the table in front of me contained the images of my summer—carefully catalogued evidence of the time I had spent trekking around the Malay Peninsula of Southeast Asia. (Less well documented? The hours spent editing copy and formatting spreadsheets at the gallery where I interned.) I had not backed up the photos; my phone’s resuscitation was my only hope.
Almost as soon as I left Malaysia, I was unsure of whether or not I had really been there at all. After three months of sweat-hazed exploring, I returned home to chilly Northern California and set about forgetting everything that had happened in the previous weeks. My tan lines receded with admirable speed, and with them, my certainty that I had really been to the other side of the world diminished as well.
Physical evidence seemed to disappear. The boringly meticulous cloth journals I had carried around everywhere unwrote themselves, ink winding backwards along the page and furling inside the reservoirs of lost pens. The many small items I had pocketed during my travels—interestingly shaped rocks, canisters of sharp-smelling tea, an incredibly loud metal keychain—had turned mutinous or were imbued with their own sense of wanderlust and took off almost immediately. Lacking any physical evidence that my summer travels had indeed taken place, I was left to conclude that I had dreamed the whole thing. And now, the photographs were gone, too.
Indeed, without any reliable record of my time there, I began to wonder if Malaysia really existed at all. Malaysia is, after all, a complicated place, and it can be difficult to find traces of the past even within the country itself. The port town of Melaka (probably better known by its anglicized alter ego, Malacca) is a kind of palimpsest of a colonial past.

The Portuguese were the first to conquer the city in 1511, taking stones from graves and mosques to build their fortifications. A century or so later, the Dutch arrived and filled those fortresses with heavy VOC cannons pointed toward the blue water of the strait. By the time the British showed up in the mid-eighteenth century, the Melakans were weary of watching their city fall victim to proxy wars between great powers, and it had become unclear just who was trying to make a point to whom. Just to be safe, the latest invaders began systematically destroying the now-historic Portuguese fortifications.
Only the corner of a single old fort, A’Famosa, still stands on a bluff overlooking the city, like a door missing the wall around it. The windows and ceiling are full of sky; as a fort goes, it leaves much to be desired. There’s almost nothing left, but it’s still possible to step inside the thick slabs of walls and breathe in a few-and-far-between moment of cool. When I stepped back outside into the heat, a group of youngish boys clambering over the crumbling stones asked to take a picture with me. What happens to photographs we never see?
The fortresses of marauders may be gone, but there are, of course, other records of Malaysia’s history—they’re just harder to find, or perhaps harder to read. In Borneo Malaysia, secluded weavers labor over tightly knotted cloth tapestries, stained with roots and crushed leaves in bright, twisting patterns. These textiles, pua kumbu, contain stories of ancient gods that had been communicated to female weavers in their dreams. It is the work of these artisans to translate such complicated visions into strands of color, and it is a laborious process that hasn’t changed much in its long history. Sometimes, the results are geometric and abstract; sometimes, obscure animals or fanged faces grimace out from the cloth. Some dreams, it seems, are better to have than others.
There’s more than one way to keep track of the past. Weeks after I returned home, I would mix up packets of instant teh tarik, bittersweet milk tea endemic to Malaysia, and even though it wasn’t quite the same as the frothy mugs I sipped late at night in street-side food courts, at least I could remember that it wasn’t quite the same. Sometimes, as I was falling asleep in Cambridge, I would try to remember falling asleep there: a complicated negotiation between the heat and the roar of the fan and the incredibly close lightning strikes outside. More often than not, I would be asleep here before I could fully remember not falling asleep on the other side of the world.
Eventually, the necromancers at Best Buy were able to coax my phone back into consciousness long enough to pull the photos off to a safer archive, so I can look through them now and see myself walking among the ruins of a series of colonial conquests. That hasn’t particularly convinced me that any of it happened, but at least I have a record of some kind. To really remember the history of the summer, maybe I’ll have to dream about it.

**** Brian—“Interesting and unpredictable.”
“Like sleeping with an energetic rock.” “Long, slow harmonic motion.” “Close your eyes and waves crash, mountains erupt, and flowers bloom.”
It’s not poetry. It’s not Ulysses. It’s three of the 34 reviews comprising the “Consumer Guide to MIT Men.” Our intrepid guides are Susan Gilbert and Roxanne Ritchie, juniors at MIT in the spring of ’77, when the Consumer Guide hit the newsstands. It’s Yelp for men.
Considerate guides that they are, the authors spare no detail. Readers are told everything they want to know—whether the man in question is a “good lay” or “recommended in emergencies only”, a “must fuck” or, God forbid, a “turkey”—and everything they don’t.
*** Jim—“Amenable to doing anything out of the ordinary.”
The Consumer Guide was published in “thursday,” an alternative weekly publication at MIT through the ’70s. The guide sprang from MIT’s counterculture, known for its various alternative publications and its “hacks.” From the replica police car placed atop MIT’s Great Dome in 1994 to the Green Building’s transformation into a giant Tetris board in 2012, hacks were, and still are, exercises in “shocking people and making them think, getting them out of their ordinary routines,” says Peter Dourmashkin, who was an MIT grad student when the article came out on Apr. 28, 1977.
After listening to Ritchie complain about her partner’s immaturity during a recent sexual exploit, Scott Batterman had an idea: a consumer guide to men, like a consumer guide to cars. It was just a “quip” that he pitched to Ritchie over drinks. She pounced on it regardless. That night, he could see her giggling while she wrote.
“It was well-written. It was funny. We wouldn’t have published it otherwise,” Batterman, thursday’s Features Editor at the time, recalls. Although neither Gilbert nor Ritchie were thursday staff, they were friends with a lot of the guys on the newspaper, as well as many on the Consumer Guide, “who they knew wouldn’t give a damn.”
And the people who gave a damn? “We didn’t like the hierarchy,” Batterman says.
The Consumer Guide, says Dourmashkin, was a stellar hack. Some readers were embarrassed, some furious. The MIT administration was uniformly outraged. The most common reaction among students, though, says Dourmashkin: “Wow, that’s a pretty good hack!”.
*** David—“Lasts a long, long time.”
The Consumer Guide took off when Tech Talk, the MIT administration’s own newspaper, tried to censor it. “It would have died on its own,” Batterman says, “except that they put it in this big black box on the front page that made it look like state secrets.” It was then that The Crimson picked up the thread, and from there, national press coverage.
Reactions varied. Two of the Consumer Guide’s victims reported it to the administration, and two reprinted their reviews for others. (Presumably “Good with His Hands and Tongue” Craig, or maybe “I Had the Impression of Getting Laid by a Bull” Rick.)
Thursday’s Editor-in-Chief, John Roselli, was subsequently put on “informal probation.” Batterman, having stepped forward as the guilty party, was suspended for three months. Since the sentence was imposed in May, and since Batterman was a senior, he suffered only a three month delay in the reception of his diploma. Gilbert and Ritchie were put on academic probation.
* Ken—“Not worth bothering with a second time.”
Jonathan H. Alter ’79, a former Crimson editor, covered the story at Harvard. He remembers it as “really sleazy.”
“Imagine if men did it,” he says.
With Harvard’s Soccer team suspended for the season, it’s not hard to. Multiple MIT alums who remember when the Consumer Guide was published drew parallels to the Soccer team’s “scouting report.” The comparison is flawed, not least because “dialogue about sexuality really didn’t become a part of the campus culture until later,” as Alter says, but the parallels speak for themselves.
As Dourmashkin says, “We’re no longer naive about these issues. People should know better.”
At the time, Ritchie claimed to resent “the immaturity of the response of MIT”: the censorship her article received was only confirmation of the point she was making, that men protest being on the receiving end of the objectification which they dole out daily. “If that’s not feminist,” Batterman says, “I don’t know what is.”
** Omar—“A real sweet piece, lacking in experience.”
Batterman himself makes the list. He’s the last entry, presumably because he was dating Gilbert at the time of publication. “Overexcited, but well worth spending a night with,” it reads.
Asked how it feels to have achieved a meagre two stars—which translates to the ego-crushing “mediocre, but maybe worth trying”—Batterman laughs. “It was probably true at the time. Can I be perfectly blunt? I didn’t know shit about pleasing a woman.”

The Harvard Stadium was once “a student playground.”
Its story starts with Major Henry L. Higginson, a veteran of the Civil War and founder of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In 1890, Higginson presented the College with 31 acres of land in nearby Allston. His gift, he said, came without strings.
“My hope is that the ground will be used for the present as a playground for the students,” Higginson told a large crowd of students and faculty packed into Sever Hall. “But the gift is absolutely without condition of any kind.”
Higginson’s only stipulation: that the land be called “Soldiers’ Field” in honor of six friends of his, all Harvard graduates who gave their lives fighting for the Union in the Civil War. The field—and the larger athletic complex eventually constructed there—still bears that name.
For a time, the future home of Harvard football hosted a different sport. Until 1903, the College’s baseball team competed on Soldiers’ Field, while spectators crowded into rickety wooden grandstands to catch the action.
Then-University President Charles W. Eliot hated the bleachers, remarking once that the athletic fields would never be “beautiful” so long as “those squalid banks of seats” continued to “deface” them. In the spring of 1903, Eliot finally found an excuse to do away with the grandstands—an entire section caught fire during a baseball game against Princeton. Though no one was injured, Eliot put his foot down. The wooden bleachers were demolished.
Nonetheless, Harvard needed someplace to host sports fans on game day. Engineering Professor Ira N. Hollis, then Chairman of the Athletic Committee, rose to the challenge, envisioning a “viewing stand of a size then, so far as known, unmatched in modern times,” according to an alumni bulletin penned in 1916 by his colleague, Engineering Professor Lewis J. Johnson.
The only obstacle? Funding.
The University refused to contribute a single dollar. Johnson recalled that “money was of course scarce” at the time. Providence intervened in the form of the Class of 1879, who around then finalized their 25th Reunion gift: $100,000 donated towards the construction of a football stadium. The Athletic Department agreed to contribute $75,000, and the deed was done.
Hollis threw himself into the work. He became so “identified” with the project, The Sunday Herald reported in November 1903, that his students’ “proposed that the name be changed from the Stadium to the Holliseum.”
After Hollis settled on the design (a traditional Greek ‘U’) and a material (reinforced concrete), construction began apace. Engineers hurried to ready the stadium for the Crimson’s inaugural game there against Dartmouth on Nov. 11, 1903, roughly eight months after ground was first broken on the site.
The engineers’ plans succeeded, almost. At kickoff, the Stadium’s stands had yet to be completed. According to Bill Cunningham of The Boston Herald, one foreman instructed his laborers to continue working “right on through the ball game.”
The workers, however, had other ideas. Numbering among Harvard fans that day were “a group of Italian laborers who laid down their trowels to watch, and who shortly were giving their vocal all,” Cunningham writes.
Despite its fancy new stadium, the Crimson was unable to pull out the win, losing 0-11 to a strong Dartmouth side—Cunningham deemed the 1903 Big Green “mighty of muscle, fast afoot, and well equipped between the ears.” The result marked the first Dartmouth victory over Harvard football in the history of the game.
Reflecting on the day, Johnson praised the Stadium but wrote that “it may be best to draw a veil over the [game’s] results.”
Contrary to Johnson’s wishes, one Stadium worker at the game that day ensured the score would never be forgotten. After the final whistle blew, he climbed a ladder and scrawled “11-0” in the still-soft concrete by one of the Stadium’s colonnades.
“When Dartmouth beat ’em, I thought I might as well autograph the place for all time,” he told Cunningham years later. “I don’t know why I did it. None of my people went to college, but if you ever want to prove [Dartmouth] beat ’em 11-0, there it is–gouged good and deep.”

The year is 1982. The place is Harvard Stadium. The time is right smack in the middle of the Harvard-Yale game with 7:45 remaining in the first half. Suddenly, a large black balloon covered with the word “MIT” emerges at the 46-yard line, swells up to an incredible size, and explodes seconds later in a great burst and releases a puff of white talcum powder—shocking players, coaches, and spectators alike.
As the prank exploded in the media, bewildered Harvard-Yale fans quickly learned what had happened. Members of MIT’s Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity had, in classic MIT engineering fashion, crafted a technological masterpiece: a Freon-driven hydraulic balloon device that they wired into an empty circuit breaker under the field. In the lead-up to the game, the pranksters had gone to Harvard Stadium eight times in the middle of the night to install the device, working against the clock (and ducking Harvard security) in pitch darkness. DKE chapter president at the time Bruce Sohn explained that “security patterns were established every evening” and look-outs, along with camouflage outfits, ensured that the team wasn’t caught by HUPD or security cameras. The boys buried the device 36 inches underground (with the balloon six inches below the grassy surface), then ran wires into the room where the power supply was located. The apparatus was supposed to be remote controlled, but on game day it didn’t deploy. Ever resourceful, one DKE frat member snuck underneath the stadium, found the electrical room, and pulled every circuit breaker until the device was activated. Just like that, the prank erupted.
After the event, the DKE held a press conference. True to frat form, many of the brothers sat around a table drinking from beers and mugs, basking in the media attention.
“It was just Freon,” one member explained. “It’s just what you’d get in a refrigerator. It’s harmless and it’s escaping. It’s inert gas.”
The brothers would not name the perpetrator who pulled the trigger on-camera; Sohn insisted that “the whole house was there—all 40 people [were responsible].” When asked about potential danger, Sohn maintained that “it was no problem. We weren’t worried about anyone getting hurt and we knew that no one would really be near it and the balloon itself held no dangers.”
The stunt was broadcast on CBS and during the nationally televised Ohio State-Michigan game. WBZ-TV Bob Lobel called it “one of the most unbelievable things I’ve ever seen” and “the greatest college prank of all time.” The Boston Globe’s Micheal Madden called it “the prank of pranks.” The next day, a Boston Herald headline read “MIT 1, Harvard-Yale 0: Tech Pranksters Steal the Show.”
“I sat there and didn’t really know what to think. I thought the Phoenix was again rising from the ashes... I thought I had seen it all,” Harvard’s president at the time, Derek Bok, told The Crimson after the game.
The hack lives on to this day; in 2007, Sports Illustrated named the balloon the fourth best prank in college sports history. During the game, Gerry Leone, then sophomore and defensive back on Harvard’s football team, was standing right near the spot where the balloon erupted out of the ground.
“It was a big game because if we won, which we did, we would win the title—the Ivy League title,” he recalls. And then it happened: “We were standing on the sidelines, and I remember just seeing the earth break... and not knowing what was going on. The balloon popped right out of the turf.”
“We were shocked... You see the turf break and something starts coming right out of the grass—we had no idea what was going on,” Leone said.
While Leone said he didn’t know the MIT perpetrators, he professed tremendous respect for their cleverness and originality, saying that “this was highly unusual and really creative and really cool.”
Even today, the balloon prank remains one of the highlights of Leone’s time on the football team and one of his most vivid memories at Harvard Stadium. “I think it’s terrific. I think it lends to the atmosphere—nobody gets hurt, nobody gets offended—I think it lends to the atmosphere and makes it fun.”

All the interviews seem to start the same way. We say hello, and I ask how things are going, and we share a dry, tight-lipped smile, because we both know that question does little justice to its answer.
We aren’t strangers. I interviewed each of my subjects for an article about undocumented students  back in September, and I’ve collected fragments of their lives in the back of my mind: Jin K. Park ’18, frantically searching for burn remedies after his father, who was ineligible for most forms of healthcare, was injured on the job; Shankar Ramkellawan ’19, sharing a one-bedroom apartment with his family after immigrating from Guyana; Daishi M. Tanaka ’19, living alone in Los Angeles after his undocumented parents left the country and wondering when he would have the money to visit them.
But a lot has happened since September. The leaves have turned, dining hall workers have gone on strike and returned to work, heavy jackets have emerged from storage bins, and Donald Trump has ridden a current of anti-immigrant fervor into the White House.
Within his first 100 days in office, Trump hopes to begin building a wall on the southern border of the U.S. and repeal several executive actions of the Obama administration, likely including Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which allows hundreds of thousands of undocumented young people to live, work, and drive in the U.S. legally. Undocumented immigrants, at Harvard and elsewhere, are feeling fearful.
Realizing that there are few interview questions that could adequately address the anxiety and uncertainty facing undocumented immigrants at this moment, I lead each conversation with the same first prompt: “Talk me through your election night.”
Most Harvard students, undocumented or not, seem to have entered Nov. 8 with some feeling that Hillary Clinton would win the White House by the end of the night. By around 10 p.m., however,  Trump had clinched several key swing states, and the possibility of his election became material.
“I didn’t say it, but I knew in my heart that he was going to win, and it was soul-crushing,” Ramkellawan recalls. He had been watching the election results “passively” and doing homework with friends  at the Winthrop House watch party until the New York Times reported an 80 percent likelihood of a Trump victory. “Then, we stopped p-setting,” he says. “We had to watch the election.”
Tanaka hosted a viewing party for Act on a Dream, Harvard’s immigration advocacy group, in his 10-person suite in Quincy. As swing states turned red, the room went silent. People paced, cried, and called their family members. Eventually, Tanaka sent everyone home to get some sleep. “We really wanted everyone to rest and take care of themselves, however that may be,” he says.
Maribel Nava ’20, a member of Act on a Dream and an American citizen born to undocumented Mexican parents, stayed up until 5 a.m. “I didn’t want to fall asleep, because waking up would make it real,” she recalls.
The days that followed looked different for everyone. Ramkellawan dropped a p-set and a late-night shift at the Y2Y homeless shelter. Park refused to skip class after the election. Tanaka slept, took walks on the river, and spent time with his blockmates, whom he considers his family.
Ilian A. Meza-Peña ’17 found solace in the classroom. Armed with a roll of toilet paper for wiping tears, she attended “American Protest Literature,” taught by Timothy P. McCarthy ’93, and “Performing Latinidad,” taught by Lorgia H. Garcia Peña, although she is not currently enrolled in either course. In “Performing Latinidad,” students held each other and talked about how to take action. Garcia Peña led her students in planning a rally for undocumented students and writing a petition calling for their protection, which has collected more than 4,000 signatures so far.
Whether or not the end of the week included missed homework and extra sleep, the quiet, gray days after the election have forced undocumented students to grapple with difficult questions of citizenship and belonging. Most have met these questions with a mixture of despair and steely resolve.
Tanaka describes a “disconnect” with his parents, who currently live in Asia and assured him that he could just return to Japan. “It’s a very scary situation. It’s a lot of uncertainty,” he says. “I just know that this is my home and I’m not going to leave—I’m here to stay.”
Park says that the bleakness of the future is part of the existing “immigrant character,” and that progressive immigration policies, like DACA, have only come about after great hardship. “It’s not like we ever took a politician’s shit, ever, and that’s how we’re looking at it now,” he says, trailing off. “But yeah, it’s pretty hard.”
The conversations seem to, for lack of a better term, hit a wall when I ask about specific plans for the future.  By the time this story goes to print, 63 days will remain before Trump is inaugurated. It’s hard to say exactly what he will do, and when. With only blustery promises of walls and mass deportations to work from, planning the next four years as an undocumented immigrant seems both crucial and impossible.
Since we last spoke in September, Ramkellawan’s parents have become Green Card holders, and they will be able to apply for his legal residency in the U.S. The process will likely take about two years. He needs to renew DACA, which will be valid for two years if the Trump administration does not nullify the program. If all of the paperwork gets processed on schedule, Ramkellawan will live legally in the U.S. without a hitch. If not, he could be left without a Social Security number and work permit for several months, his life in limbo.
Enrique Ramirez ’17 is relieved that his parents are moving to Austin, Texas. They’ll live with his older sister, and drive less frequently. “Trump won’t necessarily have the power to deport all illegal immigrants, but he can maybe reinforce things that are already at play, like road checks,” he explains. Since the election, he has placed some of his Act on a Dream projects on the back burner.
“I was working on a handbook for undocumented students who want to study abroad, but what’s the point if I’m just going to get deported?” Ramirez gets quiet. “I’m joking, I’m joking.”
Nava says that she and her mother have already walked through the worst-case scenario. “She said, ‘Even if the worst happens, I’m still going to be with you, just in a different place,’” Nava recalls. “My siblings would go with them, and I would stay here, and I just felt so lonely in that moment.”
When I meet with Meza-Peña, she wears her History and Literature concentration t-shirt. “I’m so close to finishing my degree,” she says. “And the plan I have for myself is now going to be compromised.”
She lists the fellowships and jobs she wants to apply for, the opportunities she can only seek because she has DACA. Like Nava, she tells me her parents have begun to make custody arrangements for her younger siblings in case of their deportation.
Meza-Peña hopes to create a handbook for undocumented immigrants who are being deported, or for those with loved ones in deportation proceedings, complete with lawyers’ phone numbers and directions for navigating the complex telephone systems of deportation centers. She talks me through a process that involves PIN numbers and adding credit to an account.
“I just see it as a toolkit, like one you would have in case of earthquakes, or a tornado,” she says.
Before I part ways with Ramkellawan in Winthrop dining hall, I ask if he still carries his DACA papers with him everywhere—something I had recognized as a poignant, if slightly paranoid, quirk the first time we met.
“Yeah,” he says. “And it’s probably more important now than it was before.”

On the first day of shopping week this fall, Nisreen S. Shiban ’17 received a phone call from Syria. She immediately knew that something must be wrong.
It was one of her uncles. His voice panicked, he asked Shiban to get in touch with her father and make sure her mother was not within earshot. He had devastating news to deliver: Shiban’s maternal uncle Makarem, a former veterinarian who had practically raised her, had been killed by ISIS fighters in Aleppo. He was the latest casualty of Syria’s nearly six-year-long civil war.
Over the past six years, the war has claimed more than 470,000 lives and displaced 11 million others in what many are calling the worst humanitarian crisis since World War II. The conflict has catalyzed ISIS’s emergence as a global force of terror, created new and complex geopolitical entanglements, left countries scrambling to respond to a wave of refugees, and galvanized the spread of identity politics across the world.
Many of Harvard’s schools, including the College, report that none of their students list Syria as their primary country of citizenship. But the records do not account for students of Syrian origin with other legal statuses or citizenships, and they do not consider faculty or visiting scholars. These Harvard affiliates’ lives, families, and identities have been directly, irrevocably impacted by the Syrian crisis.
A College senior’s aunt and uncle were beheaded by rebel groups in Daraa.
An Arabic language preceptor often woke up in the middle of the night worrying about her brother and sister in Damascus.
A College freshman lost 13 relatives in the bloodshed.
A College junior’s secondary school in Aleppo shut down amid the hostilities before she could graduate.
A master’s student at the Graduate School of Education moved her family from Damascus to Cairo as the war intensified.
A junior volunteered at the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan in an effort to do something to ease the pain of her fellow Syrians.
A surgeon in Harvard’s Scholar at Risk program helped set up makeshift infirmaries to provide care to a bleeding city.
More than 5,000 miles away from the conflict that rips apart the country they love, they carry on their lives at Harvard—among peers who cannot fathom their experiences, in a nation whose President-elect has labeled them a threat.
Reconciling her identity as a Syrian with her daily life as a college student poses a perpetual internal struggle for Leen Al-Kassab ’18. While her classmates are stressing over exams and extracurricular commitments, she is thinking about the victims of airstrikes pulled out of rubble a continent away—a pattern she describes as detrimental to her mental health.
“It is my country—I should be sentimental, and I should be relating to them, but at the same time, how is that helping anyone?” she says. “That’s not going to change the fact that I have a midterm tomorrow. That’s not going to change the fact that I have a p-set due at midnight that has to be turned in.” 
Her parents tell her to concentrate on her studies, so she has learned to scroll past the videos of a burning Syria that crop up in her Facebook feed for the sake of her own sanity.
Coping with war-related grief on a busy American college campus can be isolating. When Shiban’s aunt and uncle were killed during her sophomore year, she describes feeling “heartbroken.” She told one adviser about the deaths. The adviser encouraged her to seek help, but she declined.
When her uncle Makarem died earlier this fall, she only confided in a couple of friends. Tutors who found out about his death offered her support, but she said that she was fine. Nor did she seek out University mental health services.
“All I wanted was just to think about him alone and in peace,” she recalls. “Maybe it’s a cultural thing—I grew up where you have to handle your grief yourself. You have to be strong.”
For the mourning students at Harvard who seek solidarity, members of the Syrian Humanitarian League have considered designating a day to process difficult emotions with other groups across Harvard. “We want to do something where we can just talk, discuss, and heal,” Shiban says.
In 2015, Shiban and Tala Atassi ’18 started the League, a College-recognized organization that aims to mitigate the plight of refugees. Karen Mardini ’18 and Al-Kassab were founding members. But determining what the League should do has proven challenging. “I think it’s been a huge struggle,” Al-Kassab says, “just because of how vast this thing [the Syrian conflict] is and how helpless we feel. What can we do?”
Last academic year, the group held a vigil for victims in Aleppo and a benefit concert in Ticknor Lounge. Members considered the concert, which attracted about 30 students, unsuccessful. They have toyed with the ideas of sponsoring Syrian students at Harvard Summer School and launching a campaign to raise a year of Harvard tuition as a fundraiser for educational nonprofits. But neither effort has taken off yet. “It’s just not an issue that’s close to a lot of people,” Shiban says.
The League’s failure to attract widespread support is indicative of the chasm between Harvard’s Syrians and their peers, whose circumstances and experiences differ so vastly.
“When people ask where you’re from and you say Syria, their eyes widen,” Bushra Hamid ’20 says.
Any conversation that follows is usually fleeting. “They usually ask me, they say, ‘Oh, it’s terrible what’s going on,’” Nour Barmada, an Arabic instructor from Damascus, explains. “[But] you don’t feel like people really understand the extent of the suffering of the Syrian people.” 
When Tunisian vegetable seller Mohammed Bouazizi set himself on fire in December 2010, sparking protests that led to the Arab Spring, Mardini was a ninth grader at an international school in Aleppo. The daughter of a licorice maker and a piano teacher, Mardini spent her time riding horses and playing piano.
As the Arab Spring took off, the world she had known began to slip away. By March 2011, pro-democracy protests inspired by the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt were spreading around the country. When Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s security forces fired on demonstrators in the city of Homs, a movement that began with peaceful protests turned into a full-fledged uprising.
“No one ever thinks these things are going to go on. It’s always like, ‘Oh, in a few months it will be over... It’s ending soon. I can feel it,’” Mardini says. “It started out slow and then eventually started getting worse.”
She heard rumors of kidnappings, and she sensed fellow Aleppo residents growing wary. Her parents did not permit her to stay out late with friends, and she was forced to stop her horseback riding lessons. The electricity cut off frequently, and schools closed temporarily when bombs exploded nearby. Mardini recalls that period as oddly boring. Driven indoors by the nebulous threat of violence hanging over the city, she sat at home without much to do.
That year also marked the first summer in many years that Al-Kassab did not visit Syria. Although she is a Syrian citizen, born to a Syrian father and Lebanese mother, she grew up in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. But she split her summers between Syria and Lebanon, driving from Lebanon to visit her grandfather in Damascus. In those peaceful pre-war days, crossing the border was easy.
Born in West Virginia and raised in Texas, Hamid spent three months every summer at her grandparents’ homes in Syria, where her parents grew up and her extended family still lived. She would wander around the city with her cousins during the hot, mosquito-ridden Damascus days and light candles at night when the power went out. The Hamids spent so much time in Syria that her parents began building their own house up in the mountains.
“It was so much fun,” Hamid remembers. “I didn’t realize how privileged I was until after the war [started]... My childhood was amazing because of Syria.” 
But violence escalated over the summer of 2011, preventing both Al-Kassab and Hamid from returning to the country. Hamid’s family stopped construction on that house in the mountains.
As the conflict worsened and alliances formed, the war took on sectarian dimensions. President Assad’s family is Alawite, a minority Muslim sect that comprises roughly 10 percent of the Syrian population but has ruled over the majority Sunni country since the 1960s. Prior to the Arab Spring, Syrians across ethnic backgrounds had coexisted in a fragile peace, despite undercurrents of tension.
Shiban—who was born in Syria, moved to Qatar, then settled in the United States when she was 12 years old—comes from an Alawite family. Her family had close Sunni friends in Aleppo before the war. Shiban remembers playing with their children as music floated over the balcony where the adults sat sipping a traditional Middle Eastern drink and smoking hookah.
But when predominantly Sunni rebel groups began fighting for Assad’s overthrow in 2011, they were challenging not only the regime but also long-secure Alawite control. Some used religious affiliation as a rallying cry to mobilize the population against what they considered an oppressive minority. Faced with the very real threat of a take-over by a hostile majority, the Assad regime invoked Alawites’ identity to intimidate them into allegiance.
Swayed by this rhetoric, Shiban’s cousin and uncle left for the front lines. Neither would return. 
Meanwhile, Shiban and her family noticed their Sunni friends sharing Facebook posts written by a Sunni religious leader promoting violence against Alawites. “We were very heartbroken. We were confused,” Shiban says. “When you hear about all of the infringements on human rights, constant censorship by the government… you can understand why a war like this would happen, but nobody could see people literally going against loved ones, friends, family.”
By the middle of 2012, nearly 20,000 people had been killed in the conflict, fighting had overtaken much of the west of the country, and a United Nations-brokered cease-fire had failed. For many civilians, staying in Syria was beginning to feel untenable.
The sheer magnitude of the brutal wounds and ghastly afflictions were unlike anything Dr. Mahmoud Hariri had ever seen before.
Earlier this year, Hariri entered Harvard’s Scholar at Risk program, which supports international academics under political pressures. Before he came to Cambridge, Hariri practiced as a general surgeon and served as the Scientific Vice Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at Aleppo University, where he had received his master’s and doctoral degrees. Yet his training could not fully prepare him for the horror of war. “It’s not written in the textbook… how to deal [with] and treat patients with multiple injuries, severe injuries,” he says.
When the war broke out, he rolled up his sleeves and got to work. He served as a member of the Aleppo City Medical Council, a team of doctors that treated the injured as Aleppo’s medical services rapidly deteriorated around them. Airstrikes targeting health facilities forced the Council to take its work underground, into the basements of old hospitals whose buildings might afford them some protection.
Understaffed and overworked—the number of medical specialists in Aleppo is “more or less than your fingers,” Hariri says—the doctors danced daily with death.
He compares the enormity of the suffering he witnessed to the destruction wrought by an earthquake. But an earthquake ends, he says, while the violence just kept coming. In his small makeshift operating room, often crammed with upwards of 20 people, the scene could be grim. “There is somebody screaming,” Hariri recalls, “and on the other side somebody shouting and crying for his relative or his brother or sister or someone. Limbs here, hand here.”
He continues, “When you see these hospitals… [you] find a lot of blood everywhere. You need to clean everything—even your heart and your mind—to be able to continue and proceed [with] your work.”
Al-Kassab also came face-to-face with the devastation. She went on a week-long medical mission to the Zaatari camp in the desert of northwestern Jordan, the temporary home of more than 80,000 Syrian refugees.
There, she served as a translator and helped treat patients—many of whom had sustained injuries in the fighting before escaping Syria—in a cramped trailer that barely fit a bed, the doctor, the patient, and herself. Her patients included a young man with left-hand paralysis whose brain had been pierced by a stray bullet and a boy whose legs and an arm had been blown off in a bomb blast.
“It was definitely an eye-opening experience, and it definitely taught us not to take anything for granted,” Al-Kassab says.
Syrians do not take the decision to leave their homeland lightly. “They don’t like to be refugees anywhere,” Hariri says. “Syrians are not willing to live anywhere in the world rather than their own country.” 
As summer wound to a close in 2012, a private school in Damascus held a meeting for its students’ parents. Nour Mounajed—a mother of three and now a student at Harvard’s Graduate School of Education—listened intently as the school laid out contingency plans in case of emergency: If bombs hit the city, parents should not rush to pick up their children, and students might need to spend the night in the building.
“I felt it was a really, really dangerous place to be,” Mounajed says. “That’s the time when I came out of the meeting and I felt, ‘I don’t want [my children] there next year.’” Less than a week later, Mounajed, her husband, and her three children flew to Egypt.
Mardini’s parents had always planned to send her abroad after she graduated from high school. In 1995, after securing a visa, Mardini’s mother gave birth to her in Montreal to ensure that her daughter would always have the benefits of Canadian citizenship.
That foresight paid off in 2012. The ICARDA International School of Aleppo, the private school Mardini had attended since 1999, shut its doors in April as the city’s conditions worsened. “Towards the end, it was every few days or so you would hear a bomb going off in the distance,” she says. “It was really common at night to hear gunshots.”
Mardini needed a new school. She searched “international boarding school rolling deadline” on Google, scrolled through the results, and sent in applications. The Stoneleigh-Burnham School in Greenfield, Mass. offered her the financial aid that allowed her to attend. In 2012, Mardini entered her junior year in America.
Her parents followed her across the globe, to the home of an uncle in Maryland. “At one point there were 10 to 11 people staying there,” she says. “We joked and called it the refugee camp.”
Mounajed and Mardini are some of the lucky ones. Citizenship and socio-economic circumstances prevent many Syrians from simply catching a flight out of Damascus or Aleppo. Some flee through whatever means possible to bordering countries: 2 million have escaped to Turkey, 1 million to Lebanon, 600,000 to Jordan, and 200,000 to Iraq. Others have escaped to Europe. This summer, the story of Olympic swimmer Yusra Mardini—a Syrian refugee who, alongside her sister, pulled a sinking boat of 18 people to safety en route to Greece—made headlines.
Al-Kassab’s residency statuses in Saudi Arabia and Lebanon have enabled her to escape the implications of a Syrian identity in the eyes of the law. But her Syrian passport still poses difficulties at international airports and has deterred her from returning to Syria since the start of the war. She fears losing her passport—and the U.S. visa inside of it—in the chaos.
Now is not the best time to hold a Syrian passport—the 2016 Visa Restrictions Index ranks it the fifth worst passport to hold in the world.
Al-Kassab recalls a recent visit to Lebanon when she saw two women begging on the street. Their Syrian ID cards, placed prominently on the ground in front of them, served as their only plea for help. “The fact that just having it there should cause pity enough for people... Is that what our value is, what our definition is?” Al-Kassab asks.
She came to appreciate the power of a visa—and the peril of lacking one—after her citizenship status derailed her college plans in 2013. Since she attended a British high school in Saudi Arabia, she wanted to pursue her medical studies at a British university. She landed an interview at the University of Cambridge, but her visa got rejected twice, and she missed the interview. The United Kingdom sent her third visa rejection on New Year’s Eve, two months before American colleges released their acceptances.
“At that point, it was like, ‘Shit, am I actually going to make it? Am I actually going to go to college? What am I going to do?’” she remembers thinking.
Later that year, she received an acceptance letter from Harvard and, thanks to her Saudi residency status, a visa from the U.S. But she and Mardini both have Syrian friends who were forced to delay their educations after they failed to receive visas.
When Mounajed left Damascus for Cairo in 2012, getting out of Syria was still easy. Egypt, like many countries in the region, made it very difficult for refugees to work. But she did software development jobs from afar and enrolled her children in a local school. She says that Egyptians welcomed her.
But as the war and the influx of refugees intensified so did restrictions on Syrians settling in other countries. “When I wanted to apply [for a student visa], I had heard about so many Syrians applying and not being given visas, and that made me worry about it,” says Mounajed, who used her Lebanese passport instead.
Acts of terrorism only increased suspicion of refugees and exacerbated these restrictions.
On Nov. 13, 2015, 11 ISIS operatives killed 130 people in a string of terror attacks across Paris that shook the world. The attacks fueled anti-refugee rhetoric across Europe and the U.S. and bolstered support for right-wing nationalist parties in France and other European countries.
In the days following the attacks, then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump argued that America should no longer accept Syrian refugees, likening them on national television to “Trojan horses.” Meanwhile, 30 governors—including Massachusetts Governor Charles D. Baker ’79—publicly objected to resettling Syrians in their states.
“The refugee status is really sad because these are people who left the country because it was unsafe and now they’re being perceived as a threat,” Mardini says. “They’re the people who have been terrorized, not necessarily the ones who will be terrorizing.”
The Senate struck down a House bill in January that would have virtually curtailed refugee resettlement in the U.S., and the Obama administration pledged to take in 10,000 refugees during the 2016 fiscal year—a goal it reached in August.
Still, the process of obtaining legal refugee status is long and arduous, often taking up to two years as U.S. government agencies conduct extensive background checks on applicants. Syrians who wish to enter the country must undergo additional levels of screening, making them the most heavily screened group of refugees the U.S. admits.
Meanwhile, Syrian refugees live in limbo in crowded camps in countries that neighbor Syria, like the one Al-Kassab worked in over the summer. Some of her patients from Daraa, where the fighting started in 2011, had been at the camp for nearly five years and were still not allowed to leave without permission.
Watching the war and the refugee crisis in Syria unfold from afar has reinforced Hamid’s sense of her Syrian identity.
“I could have been one of [the refugees] easily if my parents weren’t fortunate enough to come here and move here at a young age,” Hamid says. “The rhetoric spread on the media, the people being scared of them is ridiculous because it could have been me. I’m the same. It’s my family.” 
That feeling—that it could have been her—has been the source of a constant crisis of identity for Al-Kassab since the war started.
“How do I have the same passport? How do I have the same identity and I’m here and they’re there?” she often wonders. “I’m here, where my biggest worry is my midterm or what is this weekend going to look like, and there it’s like, ‘How am I going to survive this next day?’”
At the same time, Al-Kassab hopes Harvard will give her a new source of identity and security beyond actual legal status.
“I think the biggest reason I chose Harvard was because I have a Syrian passport and because I felt I need something else. I felt Harvard was my new passport. Because let’s be real, how else am I going to get anywhere else in the world?” she says. “Having Harvard as a name—that does a lot. That provides me some sort of worth in that region.”
By virtue of birth or successful visa applications, some Syrians were able to make it to Harvard. But many still have family members at home. Other relatives carve out new lives in new countries. Some are no longer alive.
Most of Al-Kassab’s relatives, able to afford travel expenses, have scattered to Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Turkey. But her 86-year-old grandfather remains in Damascus. Lonely, he passes the time by watching the news.
“When are you going to visit?” he asks his granddaughter over the phone.
“Jedda, I can’t,” she replies.
Barmada, the Arabic preceptor, fears the worst when her phone rings. Though she left Syria in the 1980s after marrying a Tunisian, her brother, her sister, and their families still live in the government-controlled region of Damascus. Her siblings practice medicine but are losing patients as poverty climbs. Inflation has made food increasingly unaffordable. They consider themselves lucky if their electricity stays on for four hours at a time.
“There is fear… something might happen to them every day,” she says. “When I receive a call now, first thing [I ask] is, ‘Are you okay?’ That’s my first question… because you are afraid of bad news always.” 
Hamid once had a boisterous family of more than 40 relatives in Syria. They are now flung across 12 countries, including Germany, Switzerland, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and the Netherlands; at one point, five of her aunts’ and uncles’ families crowded into that small unfinished house her parents were building in the mountains. “All their houses in Syria are gone,” she says. “We look at pictures of the bullets holes in the same place that we used to be.”
One of her cousins was drafted into Assad’s army and escaped to Lebanon. Another cousin has gone missing. “It’s always in the back of your head,” Hamid says. “I still have family in Syria. You don’t know how they’re doing.”
Shiban’s family has fared even worse. All of her maternal aunts and uncles were trapped in the country, despite efforts by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. Across the ocean, Shiban worried that something terrible might happen to them.
“I felt so helpless. It was miserable, you know,” she says.
In 2013, her fears became reality. During her sophomore year, her mother’s uncle and his wife were beheaded by rebel groups in Daraa. “They were dragging people into the streets, and they were using the dull parts of the blades to make an example,” Shiban says. The couple’s orphaned children now live with Shiban’s grandfather.
Some of the Syrians at Harvard are concerned that their words could affect their families. Barmada’s brother and sister do not want her to visit them for that reason. “I am [a] liability to them because if you say something, you might put them in danger and put yourself in danger,” she says. “When you live outside, you get used to being free and expressing your ideas freely.”
That fear of retaliation prompted several interviewees for this story to avoid certain topics and one College alumnus from Syria to decline to comment on the record altogether.
In the early years of the war, Hamid, then a high school student in Houston, participated regularly in rallies and advocated passionately through social media. “Then it started getting worse, and you couldn’t post anything on Facebook,” Hamid says. “You’d be so scared even for your family... If [the government] found you wrote something, your family was taken to jail, stuff like that.”
The conflict raises troubling questions for young Syrians who one day will have to explain their cultural background to their children. “How much heritage and history have we lost?” Al-Kassab says. “My kids are never going to be able to see stuff that I’m going to tell them stories about... Things that I do with my grandfather, the park we’d go to to feed the ducks—I’m going to be telling my kids these stories, and they’re not going to have anything to relate it to.”
“If it wasn’t for the Syrian crisis... I wouldn’t have thought about going back to grad school,” says Mounajed, who already had a master’s degree in computer engineering. “When the crisis happened, with hundreds of thousands of kids not going to school, I felt this was what I want to be concentrating on.”
She is not alone. The war has directly informed the academic and professional aims of many of the University’s Syrian students and scholars.
Before the crisis began, Hamid hoped to study medicine. Six years later, she plans to concentrate in economics with a secondary in government and pursue a citation in Arabic in preparation for a potential career in politics. “[The war has] grown my love for Arabic now,” she says. “I miss the culture. I didn’t realize how much I loved it until after it was taken away from me.”
During his year as a Scholar at Risk, Hariri is researching Aleppo hospitals. He will return to Syria after his time at Harvard. And compelled by a sense of obligation to her fellow citizens, Al-Kassab, a pre-med student, hopes to return to Syria as a doctor after she finishes medical school.
For some, the Syrian crisis has motivated extracurricular pursuits. It prompted Shiban to co-found the Syrian Humanitarian League and Mardini and Al-Kassab to join. Shiban has sought to keep potentially divisive politics out of the club—she is well aware that her Alawite family and the primarily-Sunni families of other members stand on opposite sides of the war.
“I try not to bring up anything,” she says. “A lot of them have many different views than I do. The views they hold are generally accepted in America.”
Al-Kassab serves as a co-sponsor of Harvard Arab Weekend, a conference that brings more than 1,000 people from across the world to Harvard annually. Last weekend, the founder of the White Helmets, a volunteer civilian rescue group in Syria, delivered one of the conference’s keynote addresses.
The region, meanwhile, has descended into chaos. As a popular revolution to overthrow an autocratic regime morphed into a convolution of global alliances, Harvard’s Syrians became increasingly cynical about a peaceful resolution anytime in the near future.
“At this point, it’s not so simple,” Shiban says. “There are so many people involved. There are the Kurds, the Alawites, the Sunnis. So many people with different interests—Russia, America, ISIS.” 
In June 2013, after determining that the Assad regime had deployed chemical weapons on rebels, U.S. President Barack Obama authorized direct support for rebel groups. And after ISIS began seizing territory in Iraq and Syria and gaining prominence on the global terrorist stage, a U.S.-led coalition started providing military assistance to rebel groups. But Turkey, a critical U.S. ally in the region, refused to support any Kurdish groups involved in the effort. In 2015, Russia began launching airstrikes in support of the regime, turning the Syrian conflict into what many analysts are now labeling a proxy war for influence in the Middle East.
Some Syrians no longer have a clear vision for the best outcome for their country.
“When people ask, ‘Oh, are you pro Assad falling?’ or whatever, it’s just like, what is going to happen after he is gone? What is the next step? Who is going to be in his place? Who is going to be controlling who is going to be in his place?” Al-Kassab wonders.
With no end to the war in sight, hearing about bloodshed in their home country and relatives in danger has become normalized for Harvard’s Syrians. “It’s a part of daily life. It’s like Trump,” Hamid says, making an analogy to the President-elect. “It’s insane. It’s not okay. But it’s there.”
The 2016 U.S. presidential election reinforced Syrians’ cynicism and brought an assurance that international interests would likely continue to steer the course of the war.
While many interviewees expressed strong opposition to Trump, some also looked unfavorably upon Hillary Clinton. She voted in favor of the Iraq war and has received criticism for urging the Obama administration to intervene in Libya in 2011—a botched intervention Obama later said made Libya “a mess.”
“Trump is like a nightmare, but Hillary—is she a better alternative?” Al-Kassab wondered in the days leading up to the election. “She was a huge hand in destroying the Middle East.”
Meanwhile, Trump made an exclusionary attitude towards outsiders, Syrians included, one of the cornerstones of his campaign. He advocated closing America’s doors to Syrian refugees and at one point called for a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. This September, Donald Trump Jr. compared Syrian refugees to a bowl of Skittles, some of which might be poisonous.
At a rally in Ohio this fall, Trump broadened his attacks on Syrians: “This isn’t only a matter of terrorism, but also a matter of quality of life,” he said. “We want to make sure we’re only admitting those into our country who support our values and love—and I mean love—our people.”
On Nov. 8, 2016, Trump was elected the 45th President of the United States. As the prospect of a Trump presidency quickly becomes reality, Syrians at Harvard must contemplate their futures in a nation whose incoming leader does not support their presence.
“I don’t even know what’s going to happen. We have a joke—we’re all internationals, me and my roommates—that we’re getting kicked out in November,” Al-Kassab said before the election. Her student visa will expire once she graduates, and she will have to reapply to remain in the U.S. for medical school—a prospect that worries her. After Trump’s victory she declined to comment further on the election.
Trump’s victory has already affected Hamid’s sister, a student at Texas A&M University, located in a state that gave Trump 53 percent of its vote. “She’s terrified,” Hamid explains. “She said, ‘I think I’m going to have to wear a baseball hat when I go out at night so people don’t see my scarf.’”
Trump’s win also carries implications for the situation on the ground in Syria. “I have concerns about… how his winning would affect the American stand about what’s going on in Syria,” Mounajed says. “The foreign policy towards the Middle East and what’s happening in Syria—that’s one of my concerns.”
During his campaign, Trump pledged to “knock the hell out of ISIS” in Iraq and Syria. He also said he will likely abandon the Obama administration’s policy of supporting rebels fighting the regime in favor of cooperating with Russia to uphold it.
As domestic politics become more threatening and the war in Syria intensifies, Shiban, Barmada, Hamid, Mardini, Mounajed, Al-Kassab, and Hariri carry on their lives at Harvard. They study in Widener. They grade Arabic tests. They walk the tree-lined streets of Cambridge. They eat in Annenberg. They sing in choirs. They raise their children.
And they prepare for an uncertain future, which for some may include returning to Syria.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Black Law Students Association hosted Justice for Black Women Week, a series of events centering around violence and inequality affecting black women and girls, in the hopes of bringing black women to the focus of nationwide conversation.
HBLSA arranged four events starting Monday and continuing throughout the week, consisting of movie screenings, lectures, and open town-hall style discussions.
“Whenever we hear about state violence against blacks or the problems that are plaguing the black community, it’s usually framed in a way that talks about black males… the reality is that black women are affected by a lot of the same traumas that affect black men,” said HBLSA’s Internal Vice President Adabelle Ekechukwu, who helped organize the week. “For example, when police brutality affects a black woman, when there aren’t enough reproductive justice initiatives to help black women. These are things that help black women that aren’t really focused on in the media.”
The first event on Monday featured a screening of the short film "#SayHerName," which documents stories of black women killed by police, and a subsequent town hall.
“Some of the things I remember being brought up were speaking about black women and black women just almost being invisible,” said Britney Foster, a Divinity School student who attended the movie screening.
On Wednesday, associate professor of Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at the Ohio State University Treva Lindsey hosted a lunch talk titled “Hear Our Screams: A Contemporary History of State and State Sanctioned Violence Against Black Women and Girls” at the Law School.  The event attracted a crowd of about 40 people.
Lindsey addressed the “idea that black women shouldn’t speak back—the loud black woman, the aggressive black woman, the angry black woman, the unruly black woman is something that must be contained.”
She also showed a video of a 15-year-old being assaulted and pepper sprayed by Maryland police last September.
“It’s hard sometimes hearing what the reality of the state of black womanhood is, but at the same time it’s important to be informed about it. It’s important to be engaged with people to learn more about it,” said Danielle Moody, a student at the Law School who attended the event. “You have to not get comfortable and realize that black women are under a state of attack.”
The week will conclude with an event titled “The Black Power Mixtape, 1967-1975” at the Law School on Thursday. Organizers said more events will take place next semester.

After an alumni donation, Lowell House recently renamed its dining hall to Lee Hall. The new name is marked by a plaque near the dining hall entrance.

The dining hall is one of several buildings, common spaces, and professorships recently named for donors as part of the ongoing capital campaign. The rename precedes Lowell’s scheduled two-year renovation project beginning June 2017.
Kewsong Lee ’86 and Zita J. Ezpeleta ’88 lived and met in Lowell House as undergraduates. The two have been active donors to the College through supporting House renewal and establishing an endowed Faculty of Arts and Sciences professorship.
Although the plaque credits Ezpeleta, Lee, and their family for the gift, the newly named dining hall only bears his name. The professorship they established uses both Lee’s and Ezpeleta’s names.
When asked about the donation, Lowell House Administrator Elizabeth Terry declined to speak on the record, and Faculty Dean Diana L. Eck could not be reached for comment.
Students had no strong reaction to the dining hall’s new name.
“I don’t think it’s had a tangible impact dining hall-wise,” Samarth Gupta ’18 said.
Timothy J. Cavanaro ’18 recalls noticing the new signage early this semester, and does not remember a formal announcement from the House. “I think people just started noticing it, at least that’s how I found out about it,” he said.
While the name may have changed, the dining hall feels like the same community center it’s always been for many students.
“I think colloquially it’s definitely still known as the dhall or the dining hall,” Benjamin I. Pleat ’17 said. “I think honestly the places are very important, but it’s really the people inside those places that matters.”
Cavanaro added that the dining hall continues to maintain its importance to Lowell House life, regardless of name.
“Lowell dining hall is I think one of the best places on campus…. It’s just a really welcoming place, and I don’t think really much has changed based on the renaming of Lee Hall.”

The search for a new assistant dean for equity, diversity, and inclusion began last month and will last at least through early December, according to Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair.
Emelyn A. dela Peña, who previously held the role, left Harvard on Oct. 20 for a new position at Washington University at St. Louis.
In the interim period, O’Dair has been supervising the leadership of the Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, the Women’s Center, and Office of BGLTQ Student Life.
“This is a critical position to fill and one that we are approaching thoughtfully and strategically,” O’Dair wrote in an email to The Crimson.
She added that the Office of Student Life first engaged with an executive search firm two weeks ago, and the firm is currently looking to launch a national search for dela Peña’s replacement. The search consultant will be on campus in December to meet with students, staff, and faculty, with a timeline and more details for the search process “to be confirmed after the consultant’s visit.”
Coming on the heels of the surprising victory of President-elect Donald Trump on Nov. 8, the College’s search for a new assistant dean of equity, diversity, and inclusion has taken on increased relevance in recent days.
Propelled to the Oval Office in part by his fiery anti-immigrant rhetoric, Trump has stoked fears on campus about how his administration could affect the ability of undocumented students to continue to pursue their education at Harvard.
A petition calling on Harvard’s administration to protect the University’s undocumented students has garnered more than 4,000 signatures. Calling for immediate action, the petition demands that Harvard quickly hire a new assistant dean to fill the position dela Peña vacated.
The petition was followed by a rally in Harvard Yard, at which about 200 people congregated on the steps of Widener Library and delivered speeches before dozens of demonstrators, who then marched to University Hall to deliver the petition to administrators.
Aware of students’ concerns, O’Dair sent a College-wide email on Wednesday detailing steps the OSL has been taking to protect undocumented students at Harvard.
“Over the past week, I have met and talked with many of you about your anxiety and uncertainty regarding what lies ahead for our country, as well for our Harvard College community,” she wrote.
Condemning any act of bias, harassment, or discrimination on campus, she additionally said that she had asked Loc Truong, the director of diversity and inclusion programs for the Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, to make resources that are available to undocumented students more visible and accessible.
O’Dair concluded her email with a brief update on the College’s progress in searching for a new assistant dean for equity, diversity, and inclusion.

As Yalies descend on campus this weekend for the 133rd Harvard-Yale Game, many of them will be trading in their New Haven dorm beds for air mattresses, couches, and even floors at Harvard.
Houses, student organizations, and individual students are preparing to host hundreds of Yale students who will be congregating in Cambridge for this weekend’s events.
Most commonly, organized hosting for the Game manifests through the sister relationships between Harvard’s Houses and Yale’s residential colleges. From origins dating back more than 80 years, Houses and colleges have reciprocally provided housing for each year’s game.
At Harvard, Houses work to create a comfortable environment for incoming Yale students, Faculty Deans say.
Adams House has a welcome event for students arriving on Friday night from its sister school, Saybrook College, as well as a joint breakfast on Saturday, according to Faculty Dean Judith S. “Judy” Palfrey ’67.
Mather Faculty Dean Michael D. Rosengarten noted a number of initiatives between Mather House and its sister college, Morse College, to improve conditions for visiting Yale students.
One tradition, started four years ago, involves a large brain break on the Friday before the Game for hungry Yale students who might not have had the opportunity to eat dinner while traveling. In a new tradition beginning this year, Mather affiliates have encouraged individual residents to sign up as a host for a Morse student to provide a better experience as compared to sleeping on the common rooms' floors. On Game day, as always, breakfast will feature celebratory mimosas for those of drinking age.
To Rosengarten, the sister relationships are not only about “forming a closer bond and showing respect, but also ensuring that when Harvard students are at Yale, they are also received [well].”
Many students also choose to host Yale students outside of the sister relationships, both through efforts organized through student groups and through friendships with Yale students.
Hirsh Jain ’17 will be hosting two of his friends from high school for the weekend.
“They have never been to Harvard and have been meaning to visit for a very long time, and they figured this would be a good time to do so,” he said.

With less than a day left for students to vote in the Undergraduate Council election, presidential and vice presidential hopefuls have taken to social media and door-to-door campaigning to promote their candidacies.
The campaign, which officially began last Wednesday, has featured four tickets running to be next year’s UC leaders: Scott Ely ’18 with running mate Evan M. Bonsall ’19, Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18 with running mate Alex Popovski ’19, Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 with running mate Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18, and Grant S. Solomon ’18 with running mate Alexander T. Moore ’18. 
During the election cycle, all four tickets have set up websites and Facebook pages to promote their campaigns and encourage students to vote. At least one ticket has an active Twitter account, and multiple tickets have used Facebook’s paid post-boosting service to promote their campaign pages.
Several students said they would not have known the election was happening had it not been for activity on social media.
“I didn't know it was happening until people started posting pictures on Facebook,” Max O. Lesser ’19 said, referring to several campaigns which have encouraged students to change their profile pictures in support of their preferred candidate.
Despite efforts to reach out to students, some students said they still did not know what distinguished the tickets from one another. Christopher Colby ’19 said he would not vote in part because he did not know how any ticket would affect his life.
“I don’t feel informed enough,” Colby, who transferred to Harvard this year from Dartmouth, said.
Several candidates and supporters have taken to knocking on doors across campus to talk to students and encourage them to vote. While some students said room visits from candidates helped to inform their decisions, others said they did not find the visits helpful.
“I honestly find that pretty annoying,” Lesser said. “I just feel like my room is a place where I go to relax, do work, focus, get away from the greater Harvard community.”
Many candidates have also chosen to deliver flyers to rooms across campus to promote their campaign. One flyer, distributed by Sachee and Khansarinia, generated some controversy. The flyer claims that theirs is “the only ticket that has” plans for certain campus issues—from bringing social life to common rooms to training each student in sexual assault prevention every year.
“Apparently Yaz and Cam don't consider us a ticket! We have the last three of those [plans],” Solomon and Moore wrote on their Facebook page Tuesday, in response to the flyer.
Khansarinia explained that the flyer was not meant to diminish other candidates’ platforms, but just to emphasize his ticket’s tangibility-focused platform.
“The intention was simply to highlight differences,” Khansarinia said. “It's a plan, it’s not just an idea. Conversations are already happening.”
Many UC representatives expressed optimism about the election, praising the experience and platforms of many of the candidates.
“We'll be in good hands no matter what,” Elm Yard representative Henry S. Atkins ’20 said.
More than 2,500 students have voted in the election as of Wednesday evening, according to the UC’s election website. Voting is open online until noon on Thursday, and the winners of the election will be announced by Thursday evening.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 17, 2016, at 11:55 a.m.
Wednesday marked the first day of the historic election vote to ratify the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers, generating buzz about the potential of student unionization from the Barker Center cafe to the M2 shuttle.
Eligible graduate student research and teaching assistants, as well as undergraduate teaching assistants, cast their ballots for or against unionization at the Phillips Brooks House in the Yard and the Dental School in Longwood. 
“There’s really an atmosphere of excitement on campus,” union organizer and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences student Abigail Weil said.
The election, run by the National Labor Relations Board, featured official observers and voting booths. Officials checked a list of names at each location, and if a name was not on the list, the students voted under challenge.
One type of challenge—a student voting outside of his or her assigned location—only requires officials to verify that the student voted once. If a student is not on a list at all but believes he or she is eligible to vote, the student can still vote under challenge, and verification will occur after the election.
Ph.D. students who are not currently working, but have previously worked and likely will work again, and are not in their dissertation completion year, were able to cast a vote. The NLRB will have to decide if the students in this particular situation can be included in the bargaining unit.
Weil said far more people are voting under challenge than expected, but she encouraged students whose eligibility is in question to still vote. One graduate student at the Kennedy School, Heli Mishael, said she had to vote under challenge but was not told why.
Long lines deterred some students at the PBHA location. At 1 p.m., the entrance to the building was filled with students waiting to vote. Several students entered the building, saw the line, and turned right back around.
“Forget that, far too many people,” one man laughed on his way out. Another woman said she had to catch the shuttle and didn’t have time to wait.
Mishael, who voted “yes” to unionization, said the process could have been smoother. She texted one of the organizers because she was concerned about the long lines but added that the 10-minute wait “wasn’t the end of the world.”
Nina Gheihman, a Sociology Ph.D. student who also voted in favor of unionization, said the wait time did not pose a problem for her.
“I thought it was very well organized, official, and very straightforward,” Gheihman said.
Several students at the Dental School location said they voted against unionization, highlighting what appears to be a rift between social sciences and humanities students, who tend to support unionization, and the sciences and engineering students. An overwhelming majority of the signatories on the email sent by students in the “Against HGSU-UAW” group came from science and engineering backgrounds.
Physics Ph.D. student Jae Hyeon Lee, who openly opposes unionization and created the “Against HGSU-UAW” Facebook page, said the students actively organizing against unionization have not focused their postering efforts on the social sciences and humanities departments.
“We think that all the humanities and social sciences departments are strongly pro-union, so maybe these active students are shying away from those departments,” Lee said.
Maya Mathur, a Ph.D. student in Biostatistics, said she voted “no” to unionizing.
“I think it would be disruptive to research,” Mathur said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard-Yale is the one game every fall that attracts enough fans to fill Harvard Stadium to the brim. Even the wooden bleachers, hidden under the overhang at the very top of the stadium, are sold out.
Temperatures usually plummet to the low 40s, and blustery New England fall winds make the experience a lot less comfortable for fans than a typical game in mid-September. But the Harvard faithful still show up in droves, driven not necessarily by the quality of the teams but instead by the ancient rivalry between these two Ivy League institutions.
It would take a miracle to pick out any one individual out of the teeming sea of Crimson and Blue. However, noticeable or not, the Little Red Flag waves on.
The legend goes that in 1884, Frederick Plummer, a freshman at the College, cobbled together a pennant adorned with a large “H.” Plummer traveled to New Haven to watch Harvard clobber Yale, 52-0, and the rest is now history. Out of this one fan’s remarkable dedication, a tradition was born.
Harvard has a rich history that stretches back to the 1600s, and its football team appropriately is steeped in tradition. It plays its home games in a Coliseum-like structure, and the Ivy League was one of the birthplaces of the sport. Appropriately, the flag had to be passed down to the next generation of loyal supporters.
The convention became that the flag would be awarded to the fan who had attended the most Harvard-Yale games in his lifetime, but it eventually became clear that it would be an impossible task to verify individuals’ attendance records. In 2001, the criterion was changed, and it was designated that Harvard’s No. 1 fan would carry the flag to avoid controversy.
The Friends of Harvard Football decided this fan was Pittsburgh native Bill Markus ‘60. For the last fifteen years, he has been the chosen flag bearer on the one day of the year it makes a public appearance.
“It’s kept in a secret location that even I do not know,” Markus noted. “I’m handed the flag that day, and I surrender it as soon as the game ends. I guess there’s a desire not to have any anti-Harvard forces capture the flag, whether it be MIT or Yale.”
In 2009, the “most games attended” tradition was resurrected in a campaign led by Spencer Ervin ‘54. A new flag was constructed, and now Paul Lee ‘46 proudly waves the replica.
Saturday marks Lee’s 74th appearance at the Game, breaking the record set by Allen Rice ‘02 and Dick Bennink ‘38. Lee’s dedication to his alma mater’s team is quite literally second-to-none.
Along with people like Lee and Markus, the flag is one of the constants for Harvard in an ever-changing football landscape, albeit a rather inconsequential constant.
“It’s the kind of arcane nonsense that people enjoy,” Ervin remarked. “But I will say this, it meant a great deal to both Paul Lee and Dick Bennink.”
A banner sewn in 1884, repurposed, and then replicated. It is clear that traditions are not taken lightly in Cambridge. The persistence of these flags is due almost entirely to the vested interest many long-since graduated alumni still have in the team.
Take Ervin, for example. Despite saying that the flag is not important in the grand scheme of things, he did take the time to write to Harvard Magazine to implore those in charge to reinstate the flag’s original purpose. Ervin had the interests of Lee and his constant dedication to the program foremost in his mind.
Lee has now attended 74 editions of the Harvard-Yale rivalry, and he may have set a mark that will never be equalled. From his days as an undergraduate to the present, he has been an unwavering supporter. One man, however, is on a quest to unseat him.
“I don’t think that I, by any stretch of the imagination, will ever hit 74 games, nor do I want to,” Ervin said. “But Paul has a son, Jeffrey, who said, ‘Someday I’m going to beat my father.’”
Markus’ dedication to the program is also indicative of the overall dedication of older fans to the team. The pervasive feeling among current students and recent graduates is that the game is a social event first and a football game second, but fans who are at Harvard Stadium or the Yale Bowl solely for football are still well-represented.
Markus says he attends each of Harvard’s 10 games each season. He even dealt with a broken-down car en route to New Haven one year. Markus eventually hailed a cab just south of Boston, and after the driver nearly took a wrong turn that would have sent him to Cape Cod, he arrived in New Haven just in time for the game. Along with Lee, Markus has a compelling case for the team’s most loyal supporter.
“It’s something that I really enjoy doing, and it’s a chance to inject a little Harvard spirit,” Markus said. “I just hope it continues long after I’m gone.”
Maybe this flag custom is only an afterthought among the grand spectacle that is Harvard-Yale. But perhaps it is not just a coincidence that Harvard is 14-1 in the fifteen years that Markus has dutifully waved the Little Red Flag.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first thing sophomore Justice Shelton-Mosley hears every morning is gospel music blaring from down the hall. Roommate and fellow receiver Adam Scott is already awake and getting ready to head across the river to the football facilities at Dillon Field House. By the time Shelton-Mosley is ready to go, Scott is already gone.
Their days usually follow a similar schedule. Get up early, head to the Field House, go to class. They always have a little time mid-day during the week to hang out and take naps. But being student-athletes in-season, that time is usually short. Unlike normal college roommates, most of the time spent between the two players is in class or on the field.
This season, Scott and Shelton-Mosley have become the focal points of Harvard’s receiving game. The roommates have missed a combined seven games throughout the season, yet they total a third of the team’s receiving yards. Shelton-Mosley and Scott are second and third on the team in total yards, respectively. Scott has also scored three touchdowns in only four games, the second highest mark on the team.
It’s interesting trying to compare the two players. On one hand, the two sophomores are remarkably similar. Both are relatively undersized (Scott is 5’7”, Shelton-Mosley is 5’9”) and rely on their quickness and speed to get open.
When asked what his favorite route to throw to each receiver is, senior quarterback Joe Viviano jokingly said “deep,” highlighting just how fast the players are. They’ve become the focal point of the team’s offense as the season has gone on.
But talking to them, differences become apparent. Scott is energetic and always has a smile on his face. He’s personable and charismatic. Shelton-Mosley, on the other hand, is subdued. He’s well-spoken, but tends not to wear his emotions on his sleeve.
That difference is shown in the way they play the game. Watching the Crimson play, it never seems like Shelton-Mosley is having as big a game as he is. He quietly runs near-perfect routes, making 10 to 15 yard catches down the sideline. But when he gets free, it’s clear that he’s the best player on the field. His football instincts are unmatched at this level.
The energy of Scott, however, is palpable. Viviano believes the Texas native is the fastest player on the team, and that quickness is shown as soon as he gets the ball in his hands. Scott relies on quick screens and short routes in order to showcase his talents. He’s fast, and he uses that to his advantage. There isn’t a player in the Ivy League that can catch him.
“They’re both unbelievable,” Viviano said. “Justice is probably a little bit better route runner, Adam is just better with the ball in his hands as soon as possible.”
Defending the two players is also an exceptionally different task according to cornerback and captain Sean Ahern. Depending on the position they’ve lined up at, the difficulty changes.
“[Scott is harder to cover] in the slot,” Ahern said. “He’s a little shiftier…. They’re both great players, they both bring it every single day, and they both love to compete so it’s nice to have those two guys on offense.”
The two players have taken remarkably different paths as well. Shelton-Mosley became a star last season. The Sacramento, Calif. native was the Ivy League Rookie of the Year and was on the All-Ivy first team as a returner, second team as a receiver. He racked up 589 yards and seven touchdowns as a freshman.
Scott, on the other hand, has been plagued by injuries throughout his short career. He was forced to sit out most of last season, only catching passes in three games.
Unlike his roommate, Scott’s breakout came this season. His injury troubles carried over to the beginning of this season. He’s only played in Harvard’s last four games, but he’s made a tangible impact.
Being injured and watching Shelton-Mosley have the season he did certainly gave Scott a new perspective on the game.
“It was a time where I really just got to be a student of the game,” Scott said. “Just watching him...do big things really motivated me to get back on the field.”
It’s clear that being roommates has had an impact on the two receivers. According to Shelton-Mosley, there are plenty of advantages to having a roommate who plays the same position as himself. They’re able to watch film together in their room outside of regular practices and discuss their releases and route-running.
Disadvantages?
“This guy stays up ‘til like, three, four a.m. every morning.” Shelton-Mosley said.
Their relationship extends well beyond the field, though. They spend most of their time outside of football in the same classes, as both are economics concentrators. They also spend a lot of time outside of football and class together. According to senior quarterback Joe Viviano, they both love to dance. They’re also, at least in their opinion, fashionable and try to outdress one another. It’s always a competition, but as with all competitions, someone has to win.
“Dance moves over to Adam,” Viviano said. “It’s competitive, but you can’t beat [Scott].”
As for who earns the title for the better dresser is? Both captain Sean Ahern and Viviano had the same answer: Justice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Walking down JFK St. away from the bustle of Harvard Square, one will eventually cross Memorial Drive and reach the Charles River.
The Larz Anderson Bridge spans the width of the Charles. It marks the divide between Cambridge and Allston, but for Harvard football players, it marks a different divide.
Crossing this bridge in the dark is almost an everyday task for the Harvard football team. The players pass by Weld Boathouse, leaving their academic responsibilities behind for a while and preparing for the daily grind of morning workouts. The first whistle of their day sounds before the sun rises and the last after it sets.
Between 6:30 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. players hurry from workouts to class to practice, attempting to fit in time for a large lunch and various naps. Afterwards, between dinner and showering, homework still awaits.
“Shoot it’s tough, because you stay up until like 2 o’clock in the morning doing a p-set and then you have to wake up at like 5:30,” said sophomore wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley. “A lot of guys will be sleeping on the bus or the shuttle as we get to the locker room.”
While the actual lift starts at 6:30, players’ days begin much earlier.
“Once we get into the locker room and the weight room, we’re focused on getting better,” Shelton-Mosley said. “But up until that point we’re pretty tired and just looking forward to when the lift is done.”
In season, players lift in the morning on Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday, and the team splits itself into “cards.” The advanced card is made up of athletes who are getting to see a lot of time on the field and lifts only on Tuesday and Sundays, with Sunday being a recovery lift. The cards below that are reserved for athletes who haven’t been playing and are working towards starting positions. These players lift all three days.
“This is because the goal is just to maintain what we’ve acquired through the offseason,” said senior defensive tackle Doug Webb. “Whereas we’re trying to build up the other developmental pairs who aren’t getting reps on the field throughout the season.”
In addition to the workouts are the actual practices, which have been in the afternoon for the last 23 years.
“One hundred percent of the practices, the meetings, start at three o’clock and the practice starts at four,” coach Tim Murphy said. “The kids have a very specific schedule for Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. It’s identical so they can set their schedule to it.”
For the players and coaches, these afternoon practices extend into the early evening.  Following the three o’clock meetings are 24 five-minute practice periods, and by the time the team huddles up after the twenty-fourth block, it is usually well past 6 p.m.
“We certainly try to get out by six everyday,” Murphy said. “Whether it’s 6:05 or 6:10 by the time you huddle and talk a little bit. Occasionally it’s five or ten minutes longer.”
While the Harvard football team exclusively holds its in-season practices in the afternoon, several local teams, including Boston College, hold morning practices. Morning practices are better logistically, but they can leave players drained for the rest of the day.
“[Morning practices are] something you do have to think about just because there are a fair number of players that do miss practice or miss meetings, which certainly makes it challenging to have afternoon practices,” Murphy said. “But we just felt more comfortable having the ability to get the kids as much rest as we can in season, and meet with them prior to practice, which would be very challenging if you’re having a six a.m. practice.”
That’s just the in-season schedule. Out of season, players engage in a much heavier workout schedule, only then they attempt to gain weight rather than just maintain it. Following the season, winter lifts are held for an hour and 15 minutes in the mornings on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. During the spring, the team holds 12 spring practices. Working three days a week for four weeks, these practices begin at 6:30 in the morning.
“We were the first ones to even have workouts in the morning,” Murphy said. “I think the bottom line is that it guarantees you’ll have your whole team. It’s just really challenging to try to run a practice if you’ve got anybody, or several players, missing because they have class conflicts. So that can be challenging in terms of getting them enough repetitions, getting everybody in sync.”
The most difficult part for the athletes isn’t so much waking up early to workout. Rather, it’s maintaining the rigorous schedule of a Division I athlete while trying to simultaneously excel at an Ivy League academic institution.
“I think the biggest thing is that you get to sleep early enough on the day before and on Monday,” sophomore linebacker Anthony Camargo said. “Also, after the lift and everything, you’re going to be exhausted so you’ve got to make sure you get a good breakfast.”
Harvard’s class schedule helps a bit. Since there are few courses that meet at 8 a.m., players can finish their workout in time to grab a nap before class.
“Most classes here don’t really start until after eight o’clock,” Camargo said. “If you get showered and ready and get back to breakfast, you can get maybe a 30 to 45-minute nap before class. If I don’t get that little nap in, I’ll be nodding off throughout the day, and it’s extremely hard going on five to four hours of sleep depending on what time you fell asleep the night before.”
As it turns out, naps become a key source of refreshment for the players throughout the day. That, and careful planning, are the keys for staying on top of their work.
“If you have lift that day and practice, you’ve got to find the time to nap in between meals and class—otherwise you’re going to have a tough practice,” Webb said. “Just knowing the obligations you’re going to have... and then making the right choices so that you don’t put yourself in a bad position where you have three things due on top of football.
“Obviously if you have buddies that are in similar courses, you guys can game plan and try to figure out how to best organize your time and schedule,” Webb added.
Yet between essays, problem sets, exams and sleep deprivation, the players refuse to let their workload distract them from being successful, on the field or in the classroom.
“We do our best to get sleep, but it’s hard with all the homework, papers, and tests that we have,” Camargo said. “But when we come out here we try to put everything that is affecting us on that side of the river in the back of our mind. If we’re tired and we’re sore or whatever, we just try to get as excited as we can and as pumped up as we can.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The journey ends here.
After the graduation of 14 All-Ivy players, an epidemic of injuries, and nine weeks of bruising play, Harvard football once again stands on the brink of an Ivy League championship.
Beat Yale, and the Crimson will secure a fourth-straight Ancient Eight title for the first time ever.
Lose, and Harvard will go down as a team that squandered considerable talent and nullified a nine-year winning streak in The Game.
The pressure is high, and by no means is the Crimson perfect. The program has lost twice—to Holy Cross and Penn—and eked out its last three victories by a combined 12 points.
Still, Harvard (7-2, 5-1 Ivy) has plodded on. At the start of the season, the Crimson shouldered immense expectations and strove for a historic goal. Now everything has reduced to a single contest.
Yes, the journey ends here—at Harvard Stadium, on Saturday afternoon, and in the 133rd playing of The Game.
“The main thing is pride,” captain Sean Ahern said. “There’s so much pride between the two programs. It goes back over 100 years…. It’s for the guys who came before and built the program to what it is now.”
Last week, the Crimson could have clinched a piece of the Ancient Eight crown by downing second-place Penn. But the Quakers defended their home turf, scoring two touchdowns in the final 15 seconds to claim an epic 27-14 win.
For the moment, then, Harvard, Penn, and Princeton each possess one conference loss—which means that, for each program, a victory this weekend would lock up a share of the championship.
The Quakers play at Cornell. The Tigers host Dartmouth. And Crimson players? Well, they have a matchup of their own.
“Every year, no matter what the records are or what’s at stake, Harvard-Yale just has a different feel about it,” senior quarterback Joe Viviano said. “That’s really why you come here.”
In the long history of The Game, no program has ever built a winning streak as long as the one that Harvard now enjoys. Nine games. And if the Crimson wins, then it will push that streak to double digits for the first time.
Harvard’s destruction of Yale plays into a larger narrative of dominance. The Crimson has not had a losing campaign since 1998. In 23 seasons with Harvard, Murphy has grabbed nine Ivy titles; one more in 2016 would tie him for most all time with Carm Cozza, the Bulldogs’ coach from 1965 to 1996.
The Crimson’s hopes rest largely on the defensive line, which gives up a mere 92 rushing yards per game. The senior Cerberus of Langston Ward, Doug Webb, and James Duberg anchors the unit, but sophomore D.J. Bailey has morphed into a monster of his own, leading the team with six sacks.
Last Friday, that defensive line held Penn to a lackluster 21 rushing yards on 20 tries and gave the offense an opportunity to sneak back into the game. Which the offense did, powered by key throws from the senior Viviano.
The 220-pound Viviano embodies the following paradox: How fast can a man with two broken feet run? Pretty darn fast, it turns out.
After breaking both his feet in separate incidents as a junior, Viviano has emerged as one of the shiftiest Crimson quarterbacks in recent years. He has topped 10 rushing attempts in all but one start and scored five touchdowns.
Success through the air has come and gone in spurts. The senior has completed 62 percent of his throws for 14 touchdowns and eight interceptions. But against the Quakers, Viviano tossed three picks before halftime to dig a 14-3 hole.
“It wasn’t Joe’s best game, but I know he’s a good quarterback,” Murphy said. “We believe in him. He’ll certainly be ready to play this week.”
Whenever Viviano passes, he tends to focus on three players: senior Anthony Firkser, and sophomores Justice Shelton-Mosley and Adam Scott.
Firkser is the latest in a line of dominant tight ends. At 230 pounds, the NFL prospect mixes bowl-you-over power with catch-me-later speed. He puts up 15 yards per grab and leads all targets with seven touchdowns.
Although Shelton-Mosley has notched a single score, he has caught at least five passes every time that he has taken the field. He has sure hands and silky strides—assets that distinguish him as a kick returner.
Scott shares the workload with Shelton-Mosley, which is fitting because the off-field roommates also share a double. Thanks to a lingering muscle injury, the 5’7” Scott didn’t see action until late October, but he has electrified the Ancient Eight ever since. Averaging 80 all-purpose yards a game, Scott blows past opponents on screen passes, jet sweeps, and quick slants.
These receiving weapons might cause nightmares for a Bulldogs secondary that allows 296 passing yards per contest. In terms of scoring defense, Yale ranks last in the league by nearly a touchdown, conceding over 36 points per outing.
“When you analyze the athletes they have on the field, they have a ton of great athletes,” Murphy said. “Depth doesn’t seem to be an issue for Yale. They just haven’t put it all together.”
Injuries have plagued the Bulldogs throughout the year. Three quarterbacks have started games, and three running backs have topped 100 rushing yards.
However, Yale seems to have settled on a solid duo in freshman quarterback Kurt Rawlings and freshman running back Alan Lamar. In week five, Rawlings led the Bulldogs to a stirring win against Columbia, and the 5’9” Lamar has averaged 4.4 yards per carry.
The safety position is one source of veteran talent for Yale, as four-year starter Foyesade Oluokun and junior Hayden Carlson man the position. Back-end talent compensates for upfront weakness, as the Bulldogs are tied for last in the Ancient Eight with 15 sacks.
In any rivalry game, however, past performances mean little when the two opponents take the field.
Harvard has played nine games so far. But practically and emotionally, the results of the first nine mean nothing without a triumph in the finale.
Just ask Murphy, who has overseen 22 editions of The Game. His final thoughts?
“Expect the unexpected,” the coach said. “It’s the Harvard-Yale game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Last Lap takes place on Thursday night.
At the end of practice, with the rest of Harvard football still sweating beneath the stadium lights, the class of seniors will jog one loop around the field. Down the sideline, past the end zone, and back again.
Then they will line up and shake hands with everyone—freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and coaches. Whispered words. Sweaty hugs. Different people will use different phrases, but everyone will mean the same thing.
Congratulations. We made it. Thank you. Goodbye.
Twenty-three seniors. Some start every game and fill up the box score with yards and tackles. Others have never started, and never will.
Four from Texas, three from New Jersey, and three from Connecticut. The rest from around the country. Oregon and Wisconsin. Georgia and Pennsylvania.
No one weighs less than 180 pounds or stands below 5’11”. No one has survived four years without bruises, scrapes, pain, and often worse.
At least two—offensive lineman Max Rich and halfback Anthony Firkser—have a serious shot at making an NFL roster. In earlier seasons, both players competed alongside teammates who later went pro, and those mentors had a significant impact.
“[Ben] Braunecker I probably got the most close with,” said Firkser, naming the Chicago Bears’ tight end. “He was the main guy I looked to in style of play and his attitude out there.”
“There were three, and they all graduated last year—Anthony Fabiano, Cole Toner, and Adam Redmond,” Rich said; each of those players made NFL teams in some capacity.
For the rest of Harvard seniors, though, odds are that football will end when The Game does. On Saturday they will don pads, jerseys, and helmets. And later they will take all that off for the last time.
No senior class has accomplished what this one aims to do, namely win four straight Ivy League championships.
Already the cohort has won 35 games, yielding the third-highest winning percentage in school history. As freshmen, the players entered a dominant program, and they will leave one behind.
“A lot of guys in this current senior class are guys that maybe didn’t have the biggest role as freshmen,” safety Kolbi Brown said. “This being our time to shine, we’ve definitely stepped up to the plate and made a name for our class.”
However, the losses stand out more than the wins. There have not been many. One in 2013, when Princeton fought and fought for a 51-48 victory in triple overtime.
None in 2014. One in 2015, when Penn came into Harvard Stadium and ruined a perfect season with a 35-25 win. And then two in 2016, against Holy Cross and the Quakers.
Struggles have come in more mundane forms, too. Take the offseason routine of early-morning practices.
“It’s always tough in the winter,” Rich said. “It’s always tough when you’re working out at 5:30 in the morning. But that’s not really a low point; that’s when you’re grounding with your guys.”
Such strict discipline leads to attrition, as some players decide that other commitments matter more than football.
But for those who stick around, offseason exertion paves the way for in-season success.
And what success there has been. Heading into Saturday, the seniors have never lost to Yale. They have beaten every Ivy team home and away and completed an undefeated season in 2014 with ESPN’s College GameDay in the background.
“Going 10-0 was one of the greatest feelings,” Rich said. “Beating Yale here—nothing was better.”
Besides the between-the-lines success, the seniors have forged that insular bond that results from competition. To an outsider, the depth of that bond is, and perhaps should be, unknowable.
Looking back on his career, Firkser identified his favorite moments as occurring not in games but in film sessions—those unscripted meetings when coaches cede the floor.
“Players are teaching each other,” Firkser said. “It’s the guys coming together as a stronger unit.”
That teaching finds a final expression after the last practice, when the Crimson gathers for a team dinner. Per a tradition that Harvard coach Tim Murphy started, each senior has an opportunity to stand up and address his teammates about what the last four years have meant.
Save for the team itself, no one hears what seniors say during the speeches. But recognizing the emphasis that Murphy places on “character,” chances are that the players talk about more than wins and losses.
From the opening day of practice, Murphy promises that Harvard football imparts values that extend beyond the football field. If so, then the last team dinner is both the first and final test of that promise.
“Just being a tough, mentally strong individual—that’s something that’s going to transfer into the real world,” Brown said. “There are ups and downs in life, and how you respond to those things defines who you are.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s soccer team is facing penalties from the National Soccer Coaches Association of America after the University found that the team continued to produce sexually explicit documents rating women through 2016.
The association  released a statement indicating its board had voted to revoke all eligibility the team held “for NSCAA awards and/or recognition for the remainder of the 2016 season,” according to ESPN. The association cited failure by the Crimson to adhere to “the standard of conduct set forth in the NSCAA Code of Ethics”–which focuses exclusively on the role coaches are expected to uphold. The code of ethics asserts that, among other responsibilities, coaches must oppose “all types of discrimination, including, but not limited to, racism and sexism, at all levels of soccer”, operate under “the highest standards and regulations of the institutions they represent,” and oppose “abuse and harassment at all levels of soccer.”
The sanctions imposed by the association prevents any Harvard men’s soccer player from being recognized as members of any All-American or All-Region squad. In the 2015 season, current co-captain Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu and junior Sam Brown were both named to the NSCAA All-East Region Third Team. Earlier in the year, the team was recognized as one of 892 programs to earn the NSCAA Team Academic Award.
Last month, The Crimson reported that the 2012 men’s soccer team had produced a nine-page document ranking women, in vulgar terms, based on their perceived physical attractiveness and sexual appeal. After the Office of the General Counsel reviewed the current team and found its members had produced a similar document, Harvard cancelled the remainder of the team’s season.
“Harvard Athletics has zero tolerance for this type of behavior,” wrote Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise in  a statement when announcing the decision to cancel the season. Representatives from the men’s soccer team declined to comment on the NSCAA decision.
The Ivy League also announced earlier that the team would be ineligible for the Ancient Eight title after having its season canceled and its members would not be part of any All-Ivy teams. The list of All-Ivy awards released earlier this week did not include or make mention of any Crimson players or the team.
Before any of the school-imposed sanctions were announced, Harvard sat atop of the Ivy League and in the driver's seat for the Ivy title and an NCAA bid. Additionally, the team was top-15 in the RPI, likely guaranteeing a first round-bye in the NCAA tournament were the team to have won its final two games.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 17, 2016, at 3:15 a.m.
­Headlined by a football game that needs no introduction, the weekend before Thanksgiving is one of the only true sports weekends Cambridge ever gets. And this year, the weekend is set to begin with one heck of an opening act.
Friday night, the men’s hockey teams from Harvard and Boston College will square off for the first time since the Eagles put a quick end to the Crimson’s NCAA tournament run this past March. Therefore, in terms of the place to be on the eve on the Game, it looks like Toad’s has officially passed the baton to the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
But Toad’s fans, don’t fret. Friday night is sure to revolve around the same sorts of things you’d come to expect on the eve of The Game—in particular, losing valuables and going streaking.
To the first point, both sides will be down a member of last season’s Hobey hat trick, as Jimmy Vesey’s now scoring goals for the New York Rangers, and former BC goaltender Thatcher Demko is off playing for the Vancouver Canucks organization.
And to the latter point, the Eagles (10-2-1, 5-0-1 Hockey East) have certainly been streaking. BC has won 12 of its last 13 meetings with the Crimson, and Harvard (4-1-1, 2-1-1 ECAC) has not beaten the Eagles at home since November 2006—the same month Yale last beat the Crimson on the gridiron.
If that streak were to end Friday night, another one would too. The No. 3 Eagles have not lost a game in over a month, as they’ve gone unbeaten in their last 10 contests since dropping two of their first three. And they’ve done so with one of the youngest lineups in college hockey—one that’s made up of 80 percent underclassmen.
Among Coach Jerry York’s young bucks is Colin White, BC’s top-line center who finished second on the team in points as a rookie and has seven goals thus far this season. Also assuming a huge role has been freshman Joe Woll, who boasts the ninth-best save percentage in the country in his first season in relief of Demko.
Given the youth of the Eagles, Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 had all the more reason this week to rely on the age-old mantra that every season is different, and more specifically, that the teams who will meet Friday are far different from the teams that squared off in March.
“Each game presents its own challenge,” Donato said. “I don’t think our guys are dwelling or focusing on last year. We have a new focus and new goals, and we want to play well on Friday night. But we also know there’s a lot more hockey and a lot more important games to follow.”
Donato’s likely right about the fact no one is ‘focusing’ on last year, per se, but it’d be impossible for the No. 11/10 Crimson not to have recent history at least on the very back of its mind. For instance, while senior forward Sean Malone did echo the same mantra as his coach, he also had a memory to get off his chest.
“Obviously when you think of BC, you think of losing to them last year in a very important game,” Malone said.
When the two sides met at Worcester’s DCU Center in March, the Eagles came away 4-1 victors to punch their ticket to the second round of the NCAA tournament. BC later secured a spot in the Frozen Four for a Division I-best 25th time.
Five upperclassmen remain on the roster, and while the quintet of seniors (BC has no juniors on its roster) is vastly outnumbered by young skaters, they continue to possess a massive role in Chestnut Hill. Defying what their roster breakdown would suggest, the Eagles’ three leading point-getters are all in fact seniors. Austin Cangelosi, Matthew Gaudreau, and Ryan Fitzgerald all have 13 points, while Cangelosi leads the team with eight goals.
As for the hosts, they enter Friday night’s bout ranked 10th in the USA Today/USA Hockey Magazine rankings—right where they finished last spring in the USCHO poll.
The Crimson has only played one game against a ranked opponent, however, and that game happened just last Saturday. Against defending ECAC champion Quinnipiac, Harvard proved to be the better team in 5-on-5 play, but special teams inefficiencies and shaky goaltending wound up costing the Crimson a chance at a marquee win.
Since putting together an unsurprisingly dominant special teams performance against Division I newcomer Arizona State, Harvard is just 2-for-17 on the man advantage, and its opponents are 6-for-17 against the Crimson kill. Meanwhile, junior goaltender Merrick Madsen surrendered three goals for the second consecutive Saturday.
But by Tuesday, Madsen sounded ready to put the past behind him and focus on the Eagles, whom Donato said an argument could be made for as the most successful program in all of college hockey over the last 15 years.
“When we have a game like Quinnipiac where I feel like I might’ve been able to do something a little more, obviously it stings a little bit,” Madsen said. “But I think that I know I personally learned a lot from it, and I think our team did as well. We’re just looking to move forward.”

You can tell a lot about a person from their choices. The books they choose to read willingly, what you can find on their Facebook newsfeed, or their favorite student grill order. But since we’re fortunate enough to live in Cambridge, specifically in Harvard Square, which has so many cafés to choose from, why not learn more about yourself and your friends through the places you use to get all the caffeine you need to survive the day?
The Peet’s/Capital One Café: Maybe you’re a person who loves finance or banking and love having your latte near your future life goal. Or maybe you’re just taking advantage of the fact you can get half-off drinks with your student ID from 9 pm to 11 pm on most days. You’re not being obsessed with caffeine but being a true saver. This bodes well for adulthood.
Crema: You love to disconnect from it all. Not from the people and the crowds, but from the media and the internet and the world outside of the Square. You have no choice anyway since there is no reliable wifi at the cafe unless you can use your cellular data the entire time. You love to tell everyone what is your favorite sandwich.
Starbucks: You have admitted it to yourself and all your friends that you like the basic things in life and you’re not ashamed of it anymore. You know how to wait for the things you want in life such as the oft-heralded return of the PSL. In fact, you have a heightened and particular sense of taste because you can instantly tell if the Venti Peppermint Mocha you ordered doesn’t have the requisite amount of additional espresso shots. Your biggest problem is declaring your preferred Starbucks in Cambridge.
Tatte Bakery and Cafe: You know how to deal with suffering and waiting. Not only do you have to wait in line if you want something from downstairs but you also have to be a perceptive hunter if you want the chance of seating. You also have a love for the art as the black and white decor of the café speaks to your Instagram aesthetic. You’re a sharer, too, since that’s the best way to save on buying food.
Flour Bakery: You’re not afraid to go very far for what you want and explore new places. Not only are you the first person to try their famous Sticky Buns locally such you’re probably the only one in your friend group who knows that there is a Post Office in the Square.
Algiers Coffee House: You like your mint teas strong and have a deep down love for a great comeback story. You are a loyal and committed customer and friend, which is usually ideal, but also means you don't know when to give up.

By November, we think it’s safe to say that most students are penny-pinching, digging into their pockets for stray quarters to grab food from the vending machines. In such a dismal financial stage, free stuff is a major key. After all, no matter how loaded you are, everyone loves free stuff. Couple that with the biggest game/weekend of the year, and you definitely have our attention. Here’s a brief rundown of some of the places you can grab free Harvard gear in the next few days:
In case you missed it, the Harvard College Events Board has been in the Science Center Plaza the entire week, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. with music, photo opps and plenty of giveaways of Harvard-Yale paraphernalia. If you haven’t been yet, head over for some free stuff!
Also, you’ll have another chance to cop some of those giveaways at the Spirit Rally on Friday. The Harvard Band will be there to rile up the crowds!
Finally, The Harvard Shop is offering a sweet deal where you can get a free Harvard shot glass if you spend $25 or more either online or in-store. Obviously, you’d use this shot glass for nothing more than some fancy dorm room decor, but if you’re a deviant, check out our guide to pregaming.
Stay tuned for more information and the final installment of our Harvard-Yale miniseries: our low-down on where the Harvard-Yale after parties are going to be hosted.
