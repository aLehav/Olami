After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Editor's Note: The following piece includes discussion of severe mental health struggles and suicide. We’ve compiled a few resources that might be useful to any readers in need of help or support. Please make sure to take care of yourselves — seeking help is always worthwhile.
The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is a hotline for individuals in crisis or for those looking to help someone else. To speak with a certified listener, call 988.
If you are enrolled, Harvard's Counseling and Mental Health Services offers no cost support, including Urgent Care appointments at (617) 495-5711.
For international students, here’s a list of some internationally available support hotlines that might be helpful.
— Eleanor V. Wikstrom and Christina M. Xiao, Editorial Chairs
— Cara J. Chang, President
During my first weekend at Harvard Law School, I received an email saying that a classmate in our 80-person section had died by suicide. A native Oklahoman passionate about immigration law, Jeremy was the first person I met at the Law School. As I nervously waited to pick up my orientation packet, Jeremy kindly struck up a conversation with me and told me about his recent road trip to Cambridge with his dog, Louis. I remember thinking to myself that law school couldn’t be so bad if people like Jeremy were in my class.
Tragically, Jeremy’s story is not unique at Harvard. At the Law School, at least three students have taken their own lives in the last five years, and between 2007 and 2017, nine undergraduates died by suicide. In 2012, The Crimson estimated the suicide rate at the College was two to four times the national collegiate average, depending on the metric used.
Last fall, the University implemented a new mental health initiative to improve campus resources and raise awareness. However, these recent actions fall short in significant ways and myopically miss a crucial point about mental health altogether.
Harvard’s Counseling and Mental Health Services has been frequently criticized for its slow and bureaucratic nature, which, for some patients last year, included six-week wait times for therapy appointments. The new mental health initiative strives to streamline the patient intake process and provides students with a teletherapy alternative through the third-party platform TimelyMD. While a good start, far more is needed to bring campus resources to an acceptable level.
For the past 10 years, students have called for CAMHS to reform its care timeline, which provides only short-term counseling with sessions spaced out every two to three weeks. Harvard students need longer term and more frequent care, and the University ought to dramatically invest in CAMHS to make this a reality, along with subsidizing the $35 copay students on University medical insurance pay for many off-campus visits.
While making treatment access easier and more comprehensive is important, focusing on just this jarringly misses a crucial piece of the puzzle. Mental health issues don’t exist in a vacuum. Instead of making efforts to address structural causes of poor student mental health, like academic and institutional stressors, Harvard’s new initiative continues a trend of reluctance to interrogate the impacts of its environment on its students.
When it comes to grades, rising average GPAs have placed greater pressure on students to avoid previously acceptable grades like an A- or (God forbid) a B+. Moreover, a lack of transparency in grade distributions can make students feel competitive even in introductory classes, like Expos 20, where perceived difficulty of obtaining an A has left students to speculate about the existence of an unspoken curve.
At the Law School, the ostensibly less stressful Pass/Fail grading system is pathetically undercut by the distinction between Dean’s Scholar, Honors, Pass, and Low Pass categories. That students never receive feedback on any work in many classes prior to taking an eight-hour intensive final exam — worth 90 percent or more of the course grade — is yet another structural factor that places undue stress on students’ mental wellbeing.
Unrealistic academic workloads and expectations are also actively detrimental to students’ mental health. First year law students are required to take 18 credits their first semester, yet the maximum allowable credits for successive semesters is 16. Additionally, many students can readily recall examples of unacceptable pedagogy by professors that left them anxious and embarrassed like the dreaded and oft-abused cold call. It is indefensible to justify student suffering on the grounds of a trial by fire or by appealing to tradition. At the minimum, the University could better enforce existing academic policies, like the prohibition of assignment deadlines during most of Reading Period, or elsewise hold professors to higher standards of respecting students’ wellbeing.
Harvard’s leave policy, too, is an institutional failure. According to 2017 reporting by The Crimson, one in 20 students takes time off every year, some involuntarily. For students dealing with severe mental health issues, Harvard often imposes strict requirements for their time off and return to campus, like inflexible treatment and monitoring guidelines, as conditions of re-enrollment.
One such student “contract” has come under scrutiny in an ongoing lawsuit concerning a 2015 student suicide after Harvard imposed unforgiving and non-negotiable terms for enrollment following a previous suicide attempt. Harvard’s draconian rules allow it to escape liability at the expense of its students. It’s no wonder the Ruderman Family Foundation has scored Harvard’s leave policy at a D-.
More broadly, Harvard students frequently encounter an intractable and unaccommodating bureaucracy. At the Law School, class recording requests are only approved in limited circumstances and when made one full business day in advance. Last fall, the administration ignored a student petition to allow a remote option for the last three days of class following Thanksgiving break. The adage that Harvard doesn’t have to care about you because it’s Harvard should be evidence enough that the University needs to tune in to its students’ wellbeing.
As we continue into another semester, Harvard must take a serious look at its handling of the ongoing student mental health emergency. By ignoring its institutional responsibility to address structural factors, the University sends a dangerous message: Our campus environment is destined to make students unhappy, and we should just plod onward by developing individual coping mechanisms. Worse still, a culture of cruel optimism blames students when those paltry solutions inevitably fail in the absence of meaningful change. This is wholly inadequate. We must work toward genuine reform that confronts the ugly sides of a Harvard education. Our students deserve better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’ll admit: It’s heartwarming to see the found families formed in workplace dramas, from “The Office” to “Brooklyn 99.” Who wouldn’t want a boss like Michael Scott?
But in real life? I don’t want that. After a few internships in big tech, where I felt overextended to the detriment of my own well-being, I now am content not draining myself of my passion, goodwill, and time for a company driven by profit and self-interest, no matter how many free lattes they give me or how “friendly” or “family-like” the culture is.
In other words, you shouldn’t feel guilty about not constantly hustling and investing your entire self into your work. Your job can simply be a job.
This sentiment matches up to that of other Gen Z’ers and younger millennials in the workforce. A Gallup poll indicated that our generation is slightly more likely to not feel engaged at work compared to older generations — some employers are frustrated at this audacity of Gen Z to not go above and beyond and to challenge traditional work norms. Gen Z’ers want to set their own work hours, think it’s reasonable to end work when they finish their to-do list, aren’t excited to stay after hours like their millennial counterparts, and even hand off tasks and critiques to higher-ups.
Older generations may mutter: Where’s the care, the humility, the passion?
First, we actually care a lot about job security. Half of us older Gen Z’ers have experienced or witnessed a family member losing a job or income due to Covid-19-related shutdowns, and Gen Z’ers (along with younger millennials) report higher rates of stress and work-related burnout than older generations. We were born and raised in the tides of economic crises, from the 2008 recession to Covid-19, and are no strangers to financial instability.
And we care about career advancement. In fact, a 2022 study found that a whopping 74 percent of Gen Z and millennial workers are likely to quit within the next year due to a lack of skills development opportunities at their current workplaces – which may appear as a lack of commitment, but actually signals our desire to invest in worthwhile career trajectories.
We care. But we also care about the prioritization of our well-being, the number one thing Gen Z’ers look for in a company. Not a surprise, considering we’re the age group with the highest rates of anxiety, depression, and distress.
We care – about being fairly compensated for our blood, sweat and tears. This is a point DeAndre Brown makes in his TikToks about being a “corporate baddie,” which have accumulated 36 million-plus likes. He playfully ridicules yet evokes admiration for Gen Z’s reclamation of agency around work, from refusing to wear more than one hat beyond the job description to exclaiming, “You’re rewarding me for hard work with more work (and not a promotion)?!”
Second, older generations may think we lack humility, and we indeed shouldn’t condone clear disrespect. Still, I ask employers to consider how expectations of “humility” or hierarchy can hinder positive change.
Gen Z is courageous: We prioritize diverse, inclusive companies with ethical leadership, and we found our voice in activism in the wake of social justice reckonings. We challenge the status quo, not because we don’t care, but because we do: We see ways to make our workplaces better and more equitable. More importantly, we care about all of us being seen as humans, who deserve to have lives beyond our labor.
And third: Ideally, we’d all feel passionate about our work, uphold our values, and reject the toxic work mentality. I admit I haven’t fully done that, from my obsequious interactions within LinkedIn culture to my numerous interviews to get internships in big tech (an industry known for its perpetuation of injustices).
But often, what we’re passionate about often isn’t a nine-to-five that can keep us afloat. TikToker Nicole Daniels portrays this reality, mocking nonprofit bosses that burn-out and underpay employees but emphasize how it’s worth it for “the mission.” And prolific writer Roxane Gay notes this need for compromise between work and passion, encouraging people to hold a day job that “you can leave at the job” to adequately support creative pursuits you’re actually passionate about.
And so, we criticize the system, but are pragmatic enough to leverage it in service of better lives for all of us – from sharing viral career hacks to crowdsourcing salaries to address pay inequity (through, for example, TikTok accounts like Salary Transparent Street, which has 25 million-plus likes).
The takeaway? Gen Z is both cynical and hopeful. We make do with what we have, and we’re pretty darn good at it.
***
Back to found families: If you find one through work, that’s great! It is important to build rapport and psychological safety in a team to achieve success, and who doesn’t love a happy hour?
Still, our employers should help incorporate that bonding more into work hours: We shouldn’t feel obligated to give up already scant weekends and evenings, our only time for ourselves and loved ones. (And anyway, if our jobs work us so hard that we seek out colleagues to be our only confidantes, perhaps that signals we deserve more energy to build lives outside of our jobs).
And so, this summer, I chose between two coveted internships. One was more aligned with my passions and had more of a “we are family!” culture. But I knew it would blur my personal and work life, and leave me little energy to carve out my own peace — like doing yoga, catching up with loved ones, or doing this humble writing thing.
Thus, I chose the other one – where I’m excited to learn, work hard, and also have the distinct space to be a person.
There’s something incendiary about taking the path of lesser resistance. About sitting with the people we care about and protecting our moments of rest and play, as we tend to the gardens in strivings for a better tomorrow.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This one goes out to all the preschoolers and the high school graduates. A couple weeks ago, Cambridge Public Schools announced a program that will soon offer universal pre-K to all Cambridge four-year-olds. Two days later, Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui previewed her plan to fund free community college for all Cambridge residents.
These laudable developments brighten the outlook of education in Cambridge.
Early education gleams with benefits that all children deserve. Preschool nurtures a life-long drive for educational attainment in its attendees that encourages future high school graduation, college enrollment, and civic engagement. By reducing existing gaps in school readiness, universal pre-K helps children impeded by structural inequities in education or ill-equipped family environments to acquire the skills that will set them up for transformative academic success.
As these motivated four-year-olds become young adults in search of higher education, accessible community colleges shine just as brilliantly. Community colleges provide upward mobility for more students than do elite institutions like our own. Making these schools free further lowers barriers of entry to the dazzling benefits of education; according to the Bureau of Economics, tuition-free community colleges increased degree completions by 20 percent.
Unfortunately, Cambridge’s win remains emblematic of America’s loss.
It is hardly difficult, and in fact whispers at classism, for such programs to be successful in a city as wealthy and Democratic-leaning as Cambridge. But every child should be able to go to preschool and every adult to community college, no matter the demographics of their home. Coming up on the one-year anniversary of the last time we spoke on accessible education, we are disheartened that Congress is still stalled on the matter, stagnating the nation’s educational progress.
Nevertheless, we glow with pride seeing Cantabrigian community leaders move to improve the city’s public schooling. We commend Mayor Siddiqui — a graduate of Cambridge Public Schools who credits her own CPS experience for shaping her into the advocate she is today — for giving back to her greater community. We extend our praises to Harvard as well, for its contributions in developing the universal pre-K program — a rare, radiant occasion of our institution exemplifying the citizen leadership it so often professes.
Investment in universal pre-K and college is a high-yield investment into future generations of children and young adults. We’re delighted to see Cambridge take steps to bring this future to light, and hope for the nation to follow.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 100 supporters of Ukraine packed Memorial Church Friday to attend a concert dedicated to the victims of the war in Ukraine on the anniversary of Russia’s invasion.
Organized by the Harvard Ukrainian Student Association and the Harvard College Piano Society, the concert sought to raise awareness of Ukrainian culture and raise funds to support the Ukrainian war effort.
The event featured musical ensembles and poetry readings, including a choral arrangement of “Prayer for Ukraine” by Mykola Lysenko. Guest musician Teryn Kuzma performed selections on the bandura, the national instrument of Ukraine, and the concert closed with the singing of the Ukrainian National Anthem.
“I hope that tonight’s concert would not only provide an opportunity for reflection and remembrance but also inspire us to work towards a better future,” said Diana Lysenko, co-president of the Harvard Ukrainian Student Association and student at Harvard Extension School.
Diana Lysenko — Mykola Lysenko’s great-great-niece — said the dedication concert aimed to help those impacted by the war by raising awareness of the current situation in Ukraine.
“We are raising awareness in the community, making sure that Ukraine news stays on page one and not page four,” Lysenko said.
Organizers promoted the Razom for Ukraine fundraiser, which provides Ukrainians with humanitarian aid and medical supplies.
“I know that currently they are fundraising for the emergency generators for the hospitals in Ukraine,” Lysenko said. “They also provide humanitarian aid, so anything from food to baby necessities, personal care items, even abortion pills in certain cases, where women have been raped and they need help.”
Co-President of the Harvard College Piano Society Hyuntae Choi ’24, who helped organize the event and performed several compositions on the piano, said he joined the concert to help support Ukraine.
“I don’t have any personal connections with the war in Ukraine, but I thought it would be valuable to show support in the way that I know best how to, which is to create a musical space to gather the Harvard and local Boston community together to mark this one-year anniversary since the invasion,” Choi said.
When choosing pieces for the concert, the organizers said they wanted to focus on Ukrainian composers to best highlight Ukrainian culture, but they also aimed to tell a story.
“We didn’t want to make it just about the war; we also wanted to make it about highlighting Ukrainian music and Ukrainian culture,” he said. “Ultimately, we wanted to end on more of a message of hope and optimism and a sentiment for rebuilding.”
“All of these pieces reflect that longing for freedom and that patriotism and that pride in being Ukrainian and not having that taken away from you by Russia,” Lysenko said.
Lysenko said that support from the student body has been very helpful, noting that every participant in the dedication concert, including speakers, musicians, and organizers, was a volunteer.
“They volunteered to perform and they’ve dedicated their time and their effort to even learn Ukrainian which is really hard,” Lysenko said. “Students have been really active when it comes to fundraising, organizing events.”
Lysenko was born in Ukraine and reflected on the difficulty of watching the country in its current state.
“I still have friends and family who live there. It’s a place where you learn how to ride a bike, where you had your first kiss,” Lysenko said. “It’s been very difficult.”

Harvard University President Lawrence S. Bacow will appoint outgoing Prairie View A&M University President Ruth J. Simmons as a senior adviser to the president of Harvard on engagement with historically Black colleges and universities, the school announced Monday morning.
Simmons will officially assume her role as senior advisor to the president on June 1, just one month before Bacow departs office. Bacow will announce the appointment — a part-time role — at an event with Simmons on Monday during his visit to Prairie View A&M University.
Simmons, who is also president emerita of Smith College and Brown University, announced in March 2022 that she would step down from her role as president of Prairie View A&M University. Simmons initially planned to remain in office until June 1, but she unexpectedly announced on Feb. 10 that she would resign at the end of the month.
Simmons’s sudden resignation from Prairie View stemmed from a dispute with university leadership over her limited presidential authority to appoint senior staffers and deans as outgoing president.
Bacow said in a press release that Harvard is “indebted” to Simmons for the work she has done to reckon with the complicated history of slavery in American higher education, referencing Simmons’s creation of Brown’s Steering Committee on Slavery and Justice in 2003. The committee published a groundbreaking report detailing the connections between Brown and the transatlantic slave trade.
“Her leadership in that moment created new a path toward understanding and reckoning, and she has been walking that path ever since, urging all of us in higher education to follow her so that we might do more good in the world,” he said.
In a press release, Simmons praised Bacow for his commitment to an “inclusive future,” calling the effort to establish relationships with HBCUs a “welcome and timely message.”
“I am proud to work alongside Harvard to shape a new vision for higher education, one which acknowledges the need for institutions with different histories and missions to share expertise and productively collaborate in the interests of a more equitable society,” she said.
Simmons’s work as senior adviser to the president will move forward with the larger effort overseen by Vice Provost of Special Projects Sara N. Bleich following the University’s publication of the landmark Legacy of Slavery report last year. The work Simmons will do with HBCUs falls under the report’s third recommendation, which calls on Harvard to develop lasting partnerships with Black colleges and universities.
Bleich said in an interview with The Crimson last week that she was “thrilled” by Simmons’s appointment.
“I think there’s probably no other leader in higher education who Harvard can learn more from when it comes to thinking about meaningful engagement with HBCUs than President Simmons,” she said.

Thomas H. Lee ’65, a billionaire private equity financier and prominent donor to Harvard, died on Thursday at 78, according to family friend and spokesperson Michael Sitrick.
Lee was found unresponsive in his Manhattan office bathroom Thursday morning, the New York Post reported. Julie Bolcer, a spokesperson for the New York City Chief Medical Examiner’s Office, wrote in an email that the medical examiner ruled Lee’s death a suicide, stating the cause of death was a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
Sitrick did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday.
In a statement published via PR Newswire Thursday, Sitrick said that the family is “extremely saddened” by Lee’s death.
“While the world knew him as one of the pioneers in the private equity business and a successful businessman, we knew him as a devoted husband, father, grandfather, sibling, friend and philanthropist who always put others’ needs before his own,” Sitrick said. “We ask that our privacy be respected and that we be allowed to grieve.”
Lee, a former resident of Leverett House, founded Thomas H. Lee Partners in 1974, a Boston-based firm where Lee helped establish the leveraged buyout investment strategy. He stepped down from his namesake firm in 2006 and went on to create Lee Equity Partners, a private equity firm based in New York.
On the homepage of Lee Equity Partners’ website, a pop-up message appeared Sunday evening announcing Lee’s death.
“Tom’s determination, commitment and strategic vision will continue to inspire all of us at Lee Equity Partners,” the message stated. “We will work every day to meet the high standards he has set for us and the entire industry.”
A major Harvard donor, Lee served as a national co-chair of the University’s capital campaign under President Neil L. Rudenstine. The campaign raised $2.6 billion before its conclusion in 1999.
Lee contributed $22 million to the capital campaign in 1996, the sixth-largest gift in the University’s history at the time. Unlike most donations, Lee’s gift was largely classified as unrestricted funds, which gave the University broad freedom in allocating the money.
At the time of his death, Lee served as a trustee of New York University Langone Medical Center and was an honorary trustee of the Whitney Museum of American Art.
Lee is survived by his wife, Ann G. Tenenbaum; five children, Jesse, Nathan, Rosalie, Zach, and Robert; and two grandchildren.
Todd M. Abbrecht and Scott M. Sperling, who serve as co-chief executive officers of Thomas H. Lee Partners, wrote in a statement Thursday that Lee was “an iconic figure in private equity.”
“He helped pioneer an industry and mentored generations of young professionals who followed in his footsteps,” they wrote. “More importantly, he was a generous and gracious individual who cared deeply about his friends, his family, and his community.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 27, 2023, at 4:16 p.m.
Harvard Law School’s Election Law Clinic is representing a coalition of individuals and civil rights groups in a lawsuit against the City of Jacksonville, alleging racial gerrymandering in election maps approved by the city council in March 2022.
The suit alleges that seven of Jacksonville’s 14 city council districts and three of its seven school board districts were unconstitutionally drawn by the city council due to racial gerrymandering.
The Election Law Clinic filed the lawsuit last May in partnership with the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida and the Southern Poverty Law Center on behalf of 10 individual plaintiffs, the Jacksonville Branch of the NAACP, the Northside Coalition of Jacksonville, the ACLU of Florida Northeast Chapter, and Florida Rising.
“We say that it’s a violation of the 14th Amendment — the Equal Protection Clause — and that the remedy would be to redraw the districts to better enfranchise communities of color,” said Ruth Greenwood, director of the Election Law Clinic.
Nicholas Warren, an attorney at the ACLU of Florida, said the original maps undermined the voting power of racial minorities by concentrating Black voters into four city council districts.
“Just looking at it, you can tell it divides the city along racial lines — really surgically picks out Black voters in specific neighborhoods or specific streets to place them into the four packed districts,” Warren said. “That results in the surrounding districts being artificially stripped of Black voters.”
Warren added he was concerned that representatives of districts “stripped” of Black voters would not have an incentive to “tend to the needs or campaign for or worry about the interests of the small minority of Black voters in their districts.”
The City of Jacksonville declined a request for comment, citing a policy against commenting on pending litigation.
The next Jacksonville City Council Election will take place on March 21, during which all seats of the council will be decided. Last month, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court order to use a map submitted by the plaintiffs for the March election.
Greenwood said the Election Law Clinic chose to back legal efforts in Jacksonville in part due to activist efforts “on the ground.”
“I think it’s hard to translate legal findings into actual political power without there being organizers on the ground, and so here there is actually an amazing organizing community,” she said. “The litigation is one of the tools in all of the work that they’re doing to try to improve the outcomes for people of color in this city.”
Dwight Bullard, a former Florida state senator who serves as senior policy advisor at Florida Rising — a plaintiff in the lawsuit — said the disputed city council maps are part of a “tradition of racial gerrymandering” across the United States.
“We’d like to see a Jacksonville that’s reflective of its demographics,” he said. “It’s not really a question of just identity politics. It’s what we’ve already seen as a trendline in Jacksonville.”
Greenwood said she hopes the case will set a “good precedent” for future racial gerrymandering litigation.
“I think strengthening the way we can bring racial gerrymandering claims is good not only for Jacksonville but for people of color across the country,” Greenwood said.
Correction: March 1, 2023
A previous version of this story misquoted Ruth Greenwood, director of the Election Law Clinic. She referenced the Equal Protection Clause, not the "protection clause."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students led a demonstration in Winthrop House’s dining hall to push for the house’s denaming during dinner on Sunday, citing both John Winthrops’ ties to slavery.
The demonstration comes amid efforts by activists — including those from the Generational African American Students Association and Natives at Harvard College — to collect signatures on a petition for use in an official denaming request through the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Students are amplifying calls to dename Winthrop almost a year after the release of a long-awaited University report detailing how slavery “powerfully shaped Harvard.” The report identified dozens of Harvard leaders and donors — including the Winthrops — who enslaved people and are memorialized on buildings today.
During the dining hall demonstration, Clyve Lawrence ’25 — who is spearheading the push to dename the house — recounted the histories of the two Winthrops. Both Winthrops, Lawrence said, enslaved people and contributed to institutionalizing race-based slavery in Massachusetts.
“They were not just slaveowners,” said Lawrence, a Crimson Editorial editor. “No, they were instrumental in creating and maintaining and defending the institution of slavery in America.”
“They did this while engaging in a war of extermination against the Native Americans who lived in this area,” Lawrence added.
Organizers Kiersten B. Hash ’25 and Jordan Young ’25 also gave speeches, offering historical context to the Winthrop name’s associations with slavery and urging students to support their cause.
“Join us in advocating for change, sign the petition, and for the wonderful students here, fill out the testimonial no matter what your opinion is on denaming, so that we can learn about your opinion,” Hash said in her speech.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane previously declined to comment on Winthrop denaming efforts by students.
Megan C. Coram ’23 — who witnessed the demonstration — pointed to house name changes that have previously occurred for “more lighthearted purposes,” citing Harvard’s decision to rename North House to Pforzheimer House in 1994 due to the Pforzheimer family’s long-standing funding contributions.
Coram said she hopes that Winthrop is denamed because of the severity of its namesakes’ ties to slavery.
“I had a vague idea that Winthrop was problematic, but I didn’t know to what extent,” Coram said. “A lot of their speeches I thought were really powerful in terms of stating the very clear numbers. This wasn’t like, ‘Oh, they had one household servant.’ It was, ‘These people had multiple slaves, and also did a huge amount of work to promote the institution of slavery,’ which is just incredibly unacceptable.”
After the demonstration in Winthrop dining hall, roughly a dozen students gathered in Boylston Hall’s Ticknor Lounge later on Sunday for a teach-in on denaming, including more in-depth historical information, an outline of the team’s research into the Winthrops, and an overview of the denaming request.
More than 30 involved students are working toward submitting an official denaming request under the FAS’ Process for Denaming Spaces, Programs, or other Entities. The deadline for denaming requests is March 1, 2023, for the 2022-2023 academic year.
“By having a large team, we’re able to pull as many diverse voices in as possible,” GAASA Vice President Ricardo R. Razón IV ’25 said in an interview.
Razon said he feels proud that the petition has engendered discourse about the Winthrops’ ties to slavery, but he asked for more active student involvement to help progress the denaming movement.
“It’s tiring enough to have to be the ones educating others about our history and our culture, so I want the school to step up and give us proposals,” he said.
In an interview following the teach-in, Lawrence said he does not believe a name change would affect Winthrop House’s underlying culture.
“The community can and hopefully will exist without the Winthrop name being involved,” Lawrence said. “I feel like the Winthrop name actually burdens the students who are affected by those actions, and so they’re in a way being harmed by the name.”
Madison R. Webb ’25, the GAASA inclusivity chair, said she hopes others see the project as “one pixel in a mosaic of change” in reckoning with Harvard’s ties to slavery.
“We know that we cannot go back and rewrite the history of our ancestors. But again, we can write a new history,” Webb said. “So what does that look like? Well, it looks like these things that are within our control, that help build a more inclusive community at Harvard, and help call attention to this dark history that Harvard has.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pulitzer Prize-winning author Joshua Cohen discussed his 2021 novel “The Netanyahus” at an event hosted by Harvard Hillel and the Harvard Book Store on Thursday.
Cohen’s novel centers on fictional Jewish academic Ruben Blum’s experience hosting Benzion Netanyahu — Israeli scholar and father of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — for a job interview at the fictional Corbin College. Cohen’s novel won the 2022 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the 2021 National Jewish Book Award for Fiction.
The talk was moderated by Harvard English professor and New Yorker staff writer James Wood.
Cohen said the novel’s premise was inspired by an anecdote he heard from Yale English professor and literary critic Harold Bloom, who told Cohen about his encounter with Benzion Netanyahu and his family. Bloom — who died in 2019 — became Cohen’s inspiration for the fictional Ruben Blum.
After hearing the story from Bloom, Cohen said, “it just wouldn’t leave me,” even though it was “nothing more than a few sentences.”
Cohen described Netanyahu’s motivations for leaving Hebrew University to pursue a career in the U.S. and for subscribing to and advancing the Revisionist Zionism movement.
“He’s a person who comes from a movement that believed its fundamental purpose was saving the Jews of Europe,” Cohen said. “He also feels excluded from history during the most consequential decades of Jewish history.”
“He’s living in suburban Long Island and suburban Philadelphia, exiled,” Cohen added.
Cohen went on to discuss the early years of the Revisionist Zionism movement and Netanyahu’s role in its development, comparing the historical movement to that of today.
“It’s very easy, I think, to calcify people into camps retrospectively,” Cohen said. “I think that there were generally people who believed that the way to get a Jewish state and Jewish self-autonomy in Palestine was to ask it, beg it from the great powers or appease the great powers.”
“And then there were the revisionists, the Jabotinskyites, and a number of other much more extreme movements who would not wait around for the Britains of this world to grant statehood,” Cohen added.
During a question-and-answer session, Cohen described the process of writing the book, which he began during the Covid-19 pandemic.
“This was a book written during April, May of 2020 that 24 publishers rejected,” Cohen said.
When an audience member asked about the novel’s use of slapstick comedy, Cohen described how “the idea that someone could not want to be comic” lends itself to humor.
“I feel like the one thing I realized was that I really loved Benzion Netanyahu, and I realized that as someone who could have these ideas that I disagree with, that I find troubling,” Cohen said.
“They become endearing when they’re had by someone who lives in Cheltenham, Pennsylvania, who’s not a Prime Minister,” Cohen added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At this time last year, a young, inexperienced Harvard men’s ice hockey team prepared for its first ECAC tournament since 2019. The Crimson surpassed expectations, winning the Whitelaw Cup and securing an unexpected NCAA tournament berth. Now, a year later, No. 7 Harvard has seen monumental growth, spending the majority of the season in the top 10 and setting a lofty end-of-season goal: a national championship.
“I think we've improved in a lot of areas,” head coach Ted Donato said. “I think we've had to find a lot of different ways to win games, against different styles and teams…I think some of the experiences we've had under pressure, whether it's playing at Cornell or playing at Michigan or the Beanpot, those are all opportunities for us to grow as a team and I think those are real key spots that we can look back at and say those helped our team get to where it is now.”
The Crimson’s growth and development was on full display on the final weekend of the regular season. On a road trip to upstate New York, Harvard throttled the St. Lawrence University Saints 6-2 on Friday night before defeating the Clarkson University Golden Knights 3-2 on Saturday evening.
“There's definitely a championship style that we know we can get to, and I think we've been making good strides these past couple weekends,” said senior defenseman and captain Henry Thrun. “When we play that way, I like our odds against anyone.”
The Crimson earned a bye in the first round of the ECAC tournament, finishing the regular season second in the conference, behind only the No. 2 Quinnipiac University Bobcats. Harvard will open its Whitelaw Cup defense at home on March 10 in the ECAC quarterfinals.
HARVARD 3, CLARKSON 2
Harvard lined up a little differently than usual on Saturday. Senior forward Austin Wong slotted in on the first line in place of first-year forward Joe Miller, taking the right wing alongside junior forward Sean Farrell and sophomore forward Matthew Coronato. Sophomore Christian Jimenez also drew into the lineup, getting time at left wing on the fourth line next to first year forward Philip Tresca and senior forward Wyllum Deveaux. Jimenez, suiting up for just his fifth game of the season, saw his first action of the season at forward.
The Crimson found themselves behind quite quickly, as Clarkson scored within just two minutes of puck drop. In the midst of a Golden Knight offensive rush, Mathieu Gosselin got the puck to the top of the right point and fired.
However, Harvard responded only two minutes later when senior captain and forward John Farinacci notched his fourth goal of the season. In a breakaway down the left side of the ice, Farinacci used a great toe-drag to create space and find the top corner of the goal behind Golden Knights goaltender Ethan Haider, evening the score.
Striking again while the kettle was hot, junior forward Ryan Drkulec added another Crimson goal just a minute later, taking the score to 2-1. Drkulec, who has been in the lineup consistently after an injury to first-year forward Casey Severo, found twine after picking up the puck after a faceoff win by senior forward and captain Baker Shore.
The rest of the first period remained scoreless, though Harvard found itself in some penalty trouble. Senior defenseman Ryan Siedem was sent to the box with five minutes left in the first, serving time for interference. Not two minutes after Siedem’s penalty expired, sophomore defenseman Jack Bar was sent to the box for holding. Starting his sentence with just twenty seconds left in the first, the penalty carried over to the start of the second. Clarkson capitalized on the opportunity, tying the game just as Bar was reentering play.
“Coming down the stretch here, there's a certain style of hockey that we want to play,” Thrun said. “Good on special teams, the power play’s been clicking. I think we gotta work on the penalty kill a little bit, but playing a good grind game.”
Soon after, the Crimson and the Golden Knights traded power play opportunities. Harvard got its first opportunity on the power-play after Ryan Richardson was sent to the box for kneeing with 11 minutes remaining in the period. Putting up only three direct shots on goal, the Crimson were unable to convert. Three minutes later, the Knights went to the advantage when Shore was charged with hooking. The penalty kill unit neutralized the situation, but it was soon tested again after first-year defenseman Ryan Healey was caught charging not a minute after the play returned to even-strength. Again, the penalty kill held strong, and even drew a penalty against Clarkson, setting up a minute of four-on-four. By the time the penalty parade was over, there were less than two minutes remaining in the period.
In the limited time remaining in the second period, Harvard pounced and took advantage. After Laferriere took a shot that missed, Moore picked up the rebound and found the twine with less than a second to play in the period. The goal was the sophomore blueliner’s first goal of the season.
The third period brought twenty minutes of hard fought college hockey. Neither team added to their score, as the Clarkson defense kept the Harvard attack to only three shots on goal, while senior goaltender Mitchell Gibson stopped eight shots from the Golden Knights. Haider was called to the bench with just under 2:30 left in favor of a sixth attacker to try to even the score, but the Harvard defense locked down the win after some final chances for Clarkson.
“He's one of the best goalies in the country,” Thrun said of Gibson. “Sometimes he doesn't get enough recognition for what he does…obviously, his numbers are pretty impressive, as well as the presence he has back there for us.”
HARVARD 6, ST. LAWRENCE 2
The Crimson got out to a fast start, with early chances for Thrun and Healey. Farrell also made an outstanding defensive play to thwart a rush opportunity for the Saints. Just over eight minutes into the period, the Saints were caught with six players on the ice, giving Harvard a power play opportunity. The Crimson, which ranks second in the ECAC with a 24.5% power play conversion rate, was unable to capitalize on the opportunity, with its best chance coming after a cross-ice pass by first-year forward Joe Miller set up Thrun for a one-timer.
Play evened out after the power play, with the Saints improving their offensive game and forcing senior goaltender Mitchell Gibson to make some quality saves. With 90 seconds remaining in the first period, St. Lawrence took another too many men on the ice penalty, sending Harvard’s lethal power play unit back onto the ice. This time, the Crimson scored only 10 seconds into the power play, as junior forward Alex Laferrire’s pass from behind the net deflected off a skate and past Saints goaltender Emil Zetterquist, giving Harvard a 1-0 lead at the end of the first period.
“Everybody preaches that being on the power play is a gift and you need to capitalize on that as much as possible,” Laferriere said. “Every time we go out there we just need to keep our foot on the gas and not be lackadaisical and just keep pressuring them.”
St. Lawrence started the second period strong, putting together some of its best shifts of the game, including a breakaway chance that Gibson shut down with a daring poke check far outside of the net. Just after a Crimson power play expired, first-year forward Philip Tresca scored for the second game in a row when he received a cross-crease pass and roofed a backhand past Zetterquist, making it 2-0. The Saints answered with a power play goal less than two minutes later after forward Ty Naaykens’ wrist shot through traffic beat Gibson, cutting the Harvard lead to 2-1.
With time ticking down in the second period, it appeared the Crimson were headed for another close game in the third period. However, goals by senior captains Baker Shore and John Farinacci in the final minute of play gave Harvard a commanding three-goal lead heading into the third period. With 54 seconds left, Shore’s deflection of a pass by sophomore defenseman Jack Bar put the Crimson up 3-1, before Farinacci scored in the final five seconds when he hammered a slap shot past Zetterquist from the left circle, extending the lead to 4-1.
St. Lawrence made it interesting early in the third period, with forward Cameron Buhl scoring a power play goal off of a rebound in front of the net, cutting the Harvard lead to 4-2. Gibson made a series of key saves in the next five minutes to keep the Saints at bay, as the home team put together its best offensive stretch of the game.
However, with under five minutes to play, Farrell snuffed out the comeback attempt with a goal on a penalty shot. Awarded the penalty shot being hooked by forward Jordan Steinmetz, Farrell skated in slowly on Zetterquist and calmly fired a wrist shot over the goalie’s glove, restoring the Crimson’s three-goal advantage. Laferriere added an empty-net goal just over 30 seconds later to give Harvard a 6-2 victory.
With two weeks off before the Crimson’s playoff opener, Donato plans to give the team ample time to rest and recover, and the head coach is optimistic that Severo and sophomore forward Zakary Karpa will be able to play when Harvard returns to the ice.
“We’ve played a lot of hockey over the last six to eight weeks, and after this weekend will be the first time we get to take a deep breath, maybe some guys with some bumps and bruises, give them a chance to get healthy,” Donato said. “Once we're in the playoff grind those games get super intense, physical, you get overtimes and all sorts of stuff that really doesn't give you a lot of opportunities to heal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The wounds are still fresh for Harvard men’s basketball, who were barred from playing in the Ivy Madness tournament on home court last season after back-to-back losses against Princeton one year ago today. The second of those two games was a one-point 74-73 victory for the Tigers, who went on to lose to Yale in the Ivy Madness final.
After falling short in its season opener to bitter rivals Princeton (18-8, 9-4 Ivy) by a single possession, 69-66, the Crimson (14-13, 5-8 Ivy) headed into a critical rematch against the first-place Tigers on Saturday needing a senior night win to have a chance at snatching the last remaining Ivy Madness qualifying spot on the final day of the season.
Despite making an epic second half comeback to turn a 19-point Princeton lead into a one-point game, Harvard was unable to finish the job, eventually succumbing to their New Jersey foes and falling short of the Ivy League tournament for the second season in a row.
“I feel bad for our seniors, of course, missing an opportunity for them to win their last home game,” said Harvard head coach Tommy Amaker. “It seems like this has been a broken record, how much we put ourselves in a hole. We battled and it's admirable to say things like that, how far back we were and being able to come back, but every time we had a chance to push it and take the lead, put the pressure on them, we just never could really come through with it.”
The Crimson started off the game with a poor first-half display. Despite creating as many shooting chances as their rivals, Harvard shot 7-for-28 from the field, an offensive disaster topped only by an 8.3% (1-for-12) three point conversion rate. With the Tigers piling in shots on 53% field goal shooting and five well-timed three pointers, the Crimson were torn apart defensively and stumbled into halftime at the bottom of a 14-point hole.
The first three minutes of the second half suggested that things might get worse for Harvard, as Princeton scored five unanswered points to complete a 10-point run and take a 19 point lead.
However, in a fight-or-flight response, the Crimson dug in and started to generate offense. In a little over two minutes, sophomore guard Evan Nelson knocked down three consecutive three-point attempts. Senior guard Idan Tretout then hit two free throws and a layup before senior forward Chris Ledlum added one more to cut the deficit to just five points with over nine minutes to play.
Princeton made a few shots and attempted to slow the Crimson momentum, but with six minutes on the clock Harvard drew within two-points of the Tigers. The tension in Lavietes pavilion had reached a peak. As the crowd urged the Crimson forward, it felt as if the team had six minutes to make or break an Ivy League season, with little time left to stay in playoff contention and avoid a 5th consecutive home defeat.
Time and time again, Harvard pushed for a game-tying basket, a chance to draw level and force Princeton to take risks. Amaker reflected on the spirited push after the game.
“We had great opportunities to do it,” Amaker said. “I just told our guys, I said ‘we had our chances.’ There’s no other way of saying it. When you do [come back from 19 points down] you have to complete it and finish it.”
With three minutes left, the Crimson forced a turnover underneath their own basket and surged up the court. Quick passing created an opportunity for Tretout to let loose an open three from the edge of the arc. The shot missed, but Ledlum anticipated the bounce and rebounded the ball out to Nelson for a second open three-point attempt. Nelson’s shot missed again, but this time Tretout rebounded, slinging the ball back to Nelson for the Crimson’s third three-point attempt in an eight second span. As the Harvard bench stood up in anticipation of a swishing net, the ball rolled around the rim, almost teasingly, before spilling out of the basket.
Against all odds, Harvard secured the offensive rebound again, this time via a jumping Ledlum, whose attempted tip-in, from no more than a foot shy of the basket, went wide. The collective sigh of the home crowd summed up the night’s frustrations.
Princeton senior guard Ryan Langborg reflected on the Harvard run post-game. “I think we had to move a little more on offense,” Langborg said. “We got a little stagnant, but at the end of the day that’s something we’ve got to work on.”
After Nelson brought the Crimson within one point of the Tigers with ten seconds remaining, Princeton closed out the game with some smart tactics, first making two free-throws and then immediately fouling, forcing the Crimson to the free-throw line and preventing one last opportunity for a game-tying three pointer.
When asked after the game about the passion and spirit Harvard demonstrated in the second half, coach Amaker highlighted that it takes a consistent performance to win a game.
“We’re very proud of that, but we also know that it's a 40 minute game,” Amaker said. “Looking at the production of key guys for our team, it [was always] going to be very hard.”
In his final home game, Ledlum was held quiet, at least by his lofty standards. Coming off of a career-high 35 point game against Cornell (16-10, 6-7 Ivy), Ledlum struggled against the Tigers, going 5-for-19 on field goals and 0-for-7 from three, but still putting up 14 points and 14 rebounds.
Ledlum has carried the Crimson this season, consistently proving himself as the best player on the court and leading the team game after game. Ledlum’s off game proved difficult for Harvard to overcome, as Amaker pointed out after the game.
“Not putting it on him or anything, but it’s just the way he’s carried us,” Amaker said. “When he's had good offensive production, and efficiency, we've been a much better team and when he hasn't, like this afternoon, it's been hard for us.”
One game away from the conclusion of an impressive Harvard career, Ledlum is eligible to play another year of college ball, although it must be outside of the Ivy League.
Princeton now sit tied for first place in the league, with the opportunity to clinch first-seed with a win on the final day and a Yale (19-7, 9-4 Ivy) loss. When asked about how it felt to end Harvard’s season on its home court senior day for the second season running, Langborg answered enthusiastically.
“It’s great,” Langborg said after the game. “My dad went to Yale so I’ve grown up with a dislike for Harvard, let's just say that.”
Langborg also expressed his optimism for the upcoming Ivy Madness tournament, which offers a NCAA March Madness tournament bid for the winning team. This year Princeton will be hosting the tournament on its home court.
“We feel great,” Langborg said. “We trust in our abilities and in each other. We’ve got a really tight group this year, so no one is beating us and we’re happy the Ivy tournament is coming to Princeton.”
Senior co-captain Luka Sakota watched senior night from the bench, unable to participate because of an injury. Fellow senior forward Tommy O’Neil also played his last home game for the Crimson alongside Ledlum and Tretout.
Despite the lingering loss, the post-game senior night festivities at Lavities honored the contributions of Harvard’s four graduating seniors, whose families were in attendance for the game.
Harvard will officially close out its season with an away game at Dartmouth next Saturday 3/4 at 2:00pm.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“This year we are definitely in it for blood,” said first-year outfielder Lael Ayala.
After falling to Princeton in the 2022 Ivy League Softball Championship, the Crimson is ready to reclaim their lost title. The Harvard softball team was ranked second behind the Princeton Tigers in the 2023 Ivy League Preseason Poll, and this second place ranking may be the motivation the Crimson need to upset predictions and defeat the reigning champions.
Head coach Jenny Allard has “put more pressure on the team in practice and trained at a much higher level” than last year, and the veteran coach is “really optimistic heading into the year.”
Allard was inducted into the NFCA Hall of Fame this past December and will begin her 27th season as the head coach of the Harvard Softball team. Allard believes that the team returns with a “strong cohort of players.” Out of 26 players, 17 are upperclassmen, giving the team plenty of experience. Six players are super seniors, and were therefore a part of the 2019 Ivy Championship team.
Allard also feels confident about her recruited class of five talented first-years: on the pitching side, right-handed pitcher Riley Flynn, who has experience from two high school state championships in Arizona “is really seasoned in her ability to play at a championship level.” Additionally, pitcher Ryan Grace has “added a lot of depth as the only lefty on the team,” according to Allard.
On the offensive side, Ayala is a disciplined batter and a “really good caller at the plate.” Lastly, infielders Lillian Cooper and Finley Payne are both “strong power hitters whose offense has really made an impact,” Allard said. Furthermore, Allard believes that the team has excellent leadership, spearheaded by senior captains Brianna Jewett and Kaitlin Lampson, and junior captain Lauren Bobowski. At the end of the 2022 season, Bobowski was a First-Team All-Ivy selection, and Lampson received All-Ivy Honorable Mentions.
The team has been upping their game in the weight room and doing a lot more conditioning compared to previous seasons. Additionally, the team is much more focused on mental discipline and focus. Last week, a sports psychologist came in to talk to the team for two hours, and then each player was required to have individual meetings with him.
Coach Allard believes that her team’s defining characteristic is that they have “a lot of grit.” The Crimson’s ability to “really dig deep in tough moments and perform under pressure” will be a key ingredient as it seeks to get back to the top of the Ivy League.
Ayala thinks that the Crimson’s superpower is that they “are not just a team, [they] are a family,” and she believes this family culture will translate to success on the field and help the team capture the Ivy Championship ring.
The Harvard Softball team opened its 2023 season this weekend at the Garnet & Gold Tournament in Rock Hill, SC. In their first game on Friday, they fell short against the Winthrop University Eagles, losing 3-2. However, on Saturday the Crimson bounced back and came out with a 6-4 victory against the Eagles and a narrow 6-5 triumph against the Fordham Rams. On Sunday, the Crimson once again came out victorious against North Carolina Central University, winning 5-4.
After a promising season opener tournament, The Crimson will travel to Boiling Springs, NC this upcoming weekend to play in the Red and Black Softball Tournament.

Please tell me that I’m not the only one going through it this early on in the semester? I have no idea if it’s the groggy weather, or my two evening lab sections this semester (because I’m a ~woman in STEM~), but I’m in desperate need of some pick-me-ups lately. So today, I’m forcing myself out of my misery to share some of the things that are keeping me going this semester.
The new HUDS updates. 
Everyone has seen THE email of the semester by now (if you haven’t, please wake yourself up and go check your inbox). From new and exciting special menu offerings and the addition of strawberry yogurt(!!) to the breakfast menu, HUDS has truly redeemed themselves. P.S. If HUDS is reading this, I love you all but please bring back the chicken-nugget-esque bricks filled with cheese and broccoli.
The fire pits in front of Annenberg. 
I have not yet had the luxury of blissfully roasting marshmallows with my friends by the fireside. However, it always warms my heart to “scoot” (yes, I’m sorry I do own a scooter) past other people being happy by the fire. An added bonus is that my hair smells like soot for the entirety of my 6 p.m. lab section even after that one second interaction.
The innovation that is Winthrop Grille. 
I’m a proud Thropstar and a regular patron of our beautiful grille. Not only does it have the best strawberry milkshakes — they bring all the boys to the (court)yard — but it also embodies the *pioneering* spirit of Harvard. I ordered their Valentine’s Day special which was described as chocolate covered strawberries. I received a plate of strawberries drizzled with chocolate syrup. Friends, I have never tasted anything better at 10 p.m. on a Thursday. It was *almost* enough to get me past the fact that I was single for yet another Valentine’s season.
My blockmate who supported me while I was in the trenches. 
HOW is an exam given three weeks into the semester a MIDTERM??? That is a complaint for another day, but seriously, why was I literally swamped with tests and assignments this early on in the semester. I definitely would not have made it through without my lovely blockmate and fellow Flyby writer, Hayeon “Rachel” Ok ’25, who was so kind as to get me my favorite CVS cookies as I was on the verge of tears. Rachel, I love you.
Elkay LZS8WSLK EZH2O Bottle Filling Station. Iykyk ;)
I was going to try and add more things to the list but there really aren’t that many things keeping me afloat at the moment. But you know what they say, the best thing about being at rock bottom is that there is only one way to go: up (pretty sure this is quoted from the SING koala).
