After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pond frontman Nick Allbrook describes the band’s newest album “Man It Feels Like Space Again"  as the “good parts of what we’ve done on other albums”—a bold statement exemplified by the album’s quirky third single “Zond.” The new release combines the group’s psychedelia of past LPs and singles with more complex and clean production. The result is an irresistible concoction: “Zond” is a highly memorable listen that serves as a testament to Pond’s growth since they released their debut “Psychedelic Mango” six years ago.
An outrageous and upbeat anthem, “Zond” reflects Pond’s new willingness to explore  quick tempos and instrumental virtuosity. Long gone are the slow-moving and ambient, if more experimental, tunes of Pond’s past. “Zond” is an abrasive, in-your-face confection that is more instantly accessible than anything the group has ever released. The sound is crisper—even with the track’s slight distortion, each melodic component sounds distinct, and a greater serving of funk and synth energize the percussion. The band exhibits creativity with the rhythm, giving life to an otherwise repetitive drumbeat through a mash of whimsical instruments. Sliding whistles, metallic twangs, and scratchy screeches complement the keyboard and drums. The result is an almost extraterrestrial melody, which isn't surprising given the constant space trope the band invokes.
Lyrics like “I don’t see you / In the waking dreams / We’re from the darkness in between” suggest some depth, but a thundering, heavy beat overshadows Allbrook’s synthesized pronunciations. While the instrumentation is complex enough that it could overpower the vocals, the interaction of the two elements couldn’t be better synced. “Zond” is not a careless hodgepodge of sounds, but an intricate orchestration where instruments serve just as significant a role in setting mood as do the vocals; the song’s reflective if mysterious lyrics are just as spacey as the varied accompaniment. As Allbrook starts to sing softly, the melody slows and loses its previous vivacity and discordance—an ingenious means of emoting both cheekiness and weightiness.
“Zond” is a fresh addition to Pond’s output because Allbrook crafts a sound that is self-aware of its outlandishness without sacrificing its spontaneity. If the single reflects what is to be expected in the rest of the “Man, It Feels Like Space Again,” then listeners are in for a wild ride.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite Nick Hornby’s broad and occasionally derided appeal, the British novelist is never as simple as he seems. Each of Hornby’s books is a subtle combination of an obsessively specific time and place, with a literary style that reflects the locale—“High Fidelity” matches the cool world of London record shop owners with prose made up of Gen X aphorisms, while “About a Boy” pairs teenage angst with Cobain-esque succinctness. The author’s demonstrated penchant for parallel style and subject is why “Funny Girl,” his brilliant new novel, looks initially so shockingly simplistic.
The book, which describes the tale of young Barbara Parker’s sudden rise from a reticent North of England pageant queen, Ms. Blackpool, to a sitcom goddess, reads like a soap opera; Hornby’s descriptions of 1964 London, Barbara’s emergence as a sex symbol under the sibilant pseudonym Sophie Straw, and the introduction of her professional circle is uncharacteristically bland. As Hornby chronicles Sophie and her co-workers’ experience of the mid-1960s revolutionary changes, however, it becomes clear that his prose mimics the burgeoning creativity of the moment. By the end of Sophie’s show in 1968, Hornby’s writing has transformed from the simple sentences of the book’s first chapters to edgier language. His linguistic acrobatics provide the backbone to Straw’s trajectory, which is in turn a searing commentary on the artistic renaissance of the society she embraces.
In the final section of “Funny Girl,” Hornby fast forwards from the dissolution of Sophie’s show, “Barbara (and Jim)”, to examine the elderly Sophie of 2014. The comedic veteran reminisces about her swinging glory days: “To a twenty-two-year-old now, 1965 was like 1915 had been to her when she was starting out. It wasn’t like that, though, was it?” Hornby’s decision to focus briefly on the present at the end of the book comes off as a poignant examination of Sophie’s aging, certainly, and it also historicizes the novel’s suddenly archaic setting. Hornby floods his contemporary epilogue with iPhones, uncreative profanity, and hipster fans of the largely-forgotten 1960s BBC sitcom. His vision isn’t uplifting, but it’s a brilliant look at the changing priorities of youth and the fleeting nature of artistic ingenuity.
Ultimately, Hornby’s comparison between the current decade and the 1960s is successful because the world he creates is so complete. In addition to the mirror that his shifting language provides for the Swinging Sixties, his characters act as tacit reflections of British society. There is Clive Richardson, Sophie’s onscreen husband and offscreen lover, whose misogyny becomes increasingly antithetical to his acting as the emergent sensitive male. The two writers of “Barbara (and Jim),” initially closeted Bill Gardiner and possibly bisexual Tony Holmes, illustrate growing conversations over sexual identity. Hornby uses the show’s producer, Cambridge-educated Dennis Maxwell-Bishop, to cogently lambast the bitter divide between high and low culture. His characters walk through a masterfully re-imagined London, encountering real-life icons like British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, Sophie’s comedic idol Lucille Ball, and a bevy of rock stars along the way. Hornby’s equally realistic set-pieces, which include a climactic scene at the premiere of “Hair,” and his inclusion of imagined newspaper reviews, complete the author’s intricate immersion.
While Hornby’s characters could become archetypes who exist solely to illustrate changing perspectives towards sex and art, the sensitivity with which he explains their hopes imbues them with exhilarating individuality. In particular, the relationship between Tony and Bill, whose writing partnership blossoms out of their meeting in jail for separate acts of homosexual solicitation, defies convention. Initially, the duo avoids the topic of sexual orientation, but as their paths diverge—Bill towards literary examination of British gay life and Tony towards an eventually beautiful relationship with his wife, June—they engage in an explosive discourse on love and honesty. Clive and Dennis, too, despite their seeming opposing roles as alpha and emotional males, are more complex than they initially appear. Hornby not only refuses to create cardboard characters but also gives every player side-splitting dialogue; even in the more conventional style of the book’s first act, the cynical repartée between the sitcom’s crew and within their heads is irresistible. The writer establishes his humor within ten pages when he describes Sophie’s doubts about being Ms. Blackpool: “She didn’t dare dwell on her numbness in case she came to the conclusion that she was a hard and hateful bitch.”
Beyond his occasionally hilarious internal observations of Sophie’s world, Hornby’s crafting of his protagonist’s life runs deeper than cheap laughs. He discusses the star’s appearance and emotions more than her hilarity, which in the hands of a lesser writer could come off as a sexist short-circuiting of her supposed charisma. While it is still an odd choice to make the comedic icon of the novel less funny than the other characters, Hornby stops Sophie from becoming a weak protagonist through his constant omniscience—maybe the reader doesn’t get her artistic process, but she sees each step in Sophie’s battle against slimy businessmen, self-doubt, and the public’s probing eye. Though there are enough laughs for several novels packed into the supporting cast, it’s a relief to have a stoic and solid central comedienne—Hornby somehow avoids making Sophie’s rise feel showy, despite the inherent flamboyance of her medium, which allows for unexpected emotional depth.
In Hornby’s decision to craft a somewhat tragic arc for “Barbara (and Jim),” the author references the convention of relaying how commercialism killed a rosy emerging western world. The rise and eventual fall of Sophie’s sitcom is, for all intents and purposes, the birth and death of 1960s U.K. idealism. Hornby sums up this dramatic if familiar novelistic scope when he writes about Sophie’s father’s first London trip: “It was a recurring theme of the visit: people versus people. The people versus her people. London versus the North. Show business versus the world.” That Hornby manages to meditate on all of these dynamics, and do so with literary elasticity, a representative yet unpredictable cast, and supreme knowledge of the era, however, elevates “Funny Girl” above nostalgic acts to be a glorious historical fiction romp.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW HAVEN, Conn.—What was a raucous gym for nearly two hours no longer was. The home to the Ivy League’s only unbeaten team entering Saturday was not that either anymore. No, as over 2,000 Yale faithful filed out of the John J. Lee Amphitheater, the remaining Harvard supporters were giving the gym a new designation after the Crimson men’s basketball team’s 52-50 victory over the host Bulldogs.
“This is our house,” the fans chanted. “This is our house!”
The Amphitheater had become the most important battleground in the Ancient Eight. The Bulldogs (16-7. 5-1 Ivy) have been on the rise for over two years, entering Saturday 5-0 in Ivy play for the first time since the league formed in 1956. After finishing third two seasons ago and second last year, Yale showed its ambition early this season with a non-conference win over UConn—a team that has stymied Harvard (15-5, 5-1).
But the Crimson diminished the building’s significance with its fourth straight win in New Haven. The win, which ensured that the road to an Ivy title still goes through Cambridge, left Harvard in control of its own destiny in the conference championship race.
The Bulldogs had gained notoriety with league-best scoring and rebounding numbers, led by Ivy League Player of the Year candidate senior Justin Sears. A rowdy crowd also helped as the team posted an 8-1 home record entering Saturday. From the opening minute of the game, the 2,500-plus in attendance let out roar after roar—for blocks, for buckets, even for Harvard turnovers—that felt uncouth in the Gothic Monastery of a basketball arena.
However, neither team could handle the big stage in the first half, according to their coaches.
The Crimson held the Bulldogs to 11 points in the first half, a record-low for Harvard’s defense under coach Tommy Amaker.
“Both teams came out and the moment got the best of both teams,” Yale coach James Jones said.
Meanwhile, the Crimson only scored 16 points on the other end. It tallied seven turnovers and went oh-for-five from three-point land along the way.
“Sometimes that happens where you’re playing so hard, you can’t shoot straight or even think straight,” Amaker said. “I think that’s exactly what happened.”
Balance is a big word for the Harvard program, Amaker says, and he told his team that it would be particularly important Saturday night.
“Can we play with passion and yet patience and poise,” he explained after the game. Can his players show forethought but still have instincts?
In the second half, Harvard found that balance.
The Crimson scored on four of its first five possessions and had just four turnovers over the first 16 minutes of the second half. Yale hung with Harvard for the first 10 minutes of the period, but then the Crimson put together a 13-4 run—highlighted by a 24-foot bomb from junior co-captain Siyani Chambers as the shot clock wound down—to grab a 10-point lead.
Chambers finished with eight points. Senior guard Wes Saunders led all scorers with 16 despite shooting four-of-13 from the field.
In the win, the Crimson managed to deny Yale its calling cards. Harvard, led by Moundou-Missi and sophomore Zena Edosomwan, outrebounded its hosts, 42-32.
“They’re the best in our league at rebounding the ball,” Amaker said. “It was a point of emphasis for us, absolutely, and if we don’t do that, we have no chance of beating them.”
The Crimson also held the Bulldogs to their fewest points in Ivy play. Sears finished with just nine points on two-of-seven shooting.
The Bulldogs, with the help of two late Harvard turnovers, still managed to make things interesting in the final moments. With a 12-4 run, Yale cut the deficit all the way to two points with seven seconds left. But it was all for naught as co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi found Saunders on a critical inbounds pass, and Saunders sank two free throws to the tune of M-V-P chants to seal the win.
Yale’s fans, loud throughout, still cheered a meaningless buzzer-beating layup that brought the game to a close on the ensuing possession. Ultimately though, it was the traveling Crimson fans who got the final say.

PROVIDENCE, R.I.—The No. 6/6 Harvard men’s ice hockey team arrived at the George V. Meehan Auditorium tired on Saturday, already having played 142 minutes of hockey this week. In its performance against cellar-dweller Brown, it showed.
Two goals proved to be enough for the Bears (5-17-1, 2-13-1 ECAC) to earn their first conference win of the calendar year, as sophomore goaltender Tim Ernst came one minute away from pitching his second career shutout, leading his squad to a 2-1 win over the Crimson (12-8-2, 8-6-2).
“I think there’s a great deal of frustration,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We’re just not creating enough offense, enough dangerous plays. [In] two games in a row, we’ve only generated two power plays.”
Having held a tenuous one-goal lead since early in the second period, Brown had to deal with a Crimson side applying constant pressure to the Bears' defense. But Brown forward Nick Lappin was able to alleviate some of the stress for Bears’ fans. The junior received a pass from the left boards and continued his drive down the slot, went backhand, and lifted the puck over the right shoulder of junior goaltender Steve Michalek.
Junior defenseman Desmond Bergin was able to make things interesting, scoring with 54 seconds remaining in the contest, but Harvard was unable to find the game-tying goal in the end.
Brown freshman forward Tyler Bird found the back of the net 1:03 into the second period, knocking in the puck during a scrum in the crease to give the Bears the early lead. The goal was the first ever for the Andover, Mass. native.
The story of the first period was missed opportunities. Within the first 100 seconds of the game, Brown senior forward Massimo Lamacchia was able to maneuver behind a sprawling Michalek, but a second of hesitation allowed sophomore defenseman Clay Anderson to move to the crease and block the shot. Later in the period, junior forwards Jimmy Vesey and Kyle Criscuolo were able to create great chances in the slot, only for the Nashville Predators prospect to be denied by a diving Ernst, and for the co-captain to miss just over the crossbar.
Frustration has been mounting as of late for the Crimson offense. Before its goal in the last minute, Harvard had not scored since a Sean Malone unassisted score at the 8:28 mark in the second period of Tuesday's Beanpot opener—a span of 172 minutes without a goal. That frustration seemed to come to a boiling point when Vesey hit Bears' forward Max Willman in response to the freshman putting the puck in the Harvard net after a whistle late in the third.
“I think the effort was there,” Donato said. "I don’t think it was a lack of effort or focus. It was there.”
Since losing junior Patrick McNally to a regular season-ending injury, the Crimson has gotten two goals off the sticks of defensemen: Bergin's score and one which came in the waning minutes of a 5-4 loss to Union courtesy of sophomore Victor Newell. McNally had four goals on the year and was second in points scored by defensemen in the conference (16) before a leg injury forced him to the bench.
The second period saw Harvard generate great chances only for Ernst and several other Brown defenders to sacrifice their bodies to block pucks from reaching twine. Sophomore forward Phil Zielonka was denied at the doorstep at the 15:40 mark by the outstretched left pad of Ernst.
Before Saturday, the Bears had last won exactly four weeks prior in a 5-3 game against now-No. 13/13 Providence. Their last conference win came on Dec. 6 against Rensselaer, who sits ninth in the ECAC.
With the loss to Brown, Harvard could fall into a three-way tie for fifth in the conference depending on the results of other ECAC matchups later on Saturday. Only the top four teams receive byes in the conference tournament that begins in March.
“I think we need to regroup completely and change our mindset,” Criscuolo said. “We need to do things harder, we need to do things faster. We need to believe that we’re going to win.”

NEW HAVEN, Conn.—After an onslaught of Yale three-pointers had kept the Bulldogs within three through 35 minutes of play, it took just a quick look from junior co-captain Siyani Chambers up at the shot clock to create some breathing room for his team and silence a rowdy New Haven crowd.
With just under five minutes to play, sophomore guard Corbin Miller sent the ball to Chambers at the top of the key. With the shot clock ticking down to five, Chambers stared down his defender before pulling up and letting the trey go about 24 feet from the hoop.
The attempt was good, stretching Harvard’s advantage to six and stymying any offensive momentum that the Bulldogs had built up to that point. The home team wouldn’t score again until there was just 1:25 left in the contest, and by that time it was too little, too late for Yale (16-7, 5-1 Ivy).
When the final whistle blew just a few minutes later, the momentum regained by Chambers’s three helped Harvard reclaim the top spot in the Ancient Eight standings, as the Crimson (15-5, 5-1) took down Yale, 52-50, Saturday night at John J. Lee Amphitheater.
“Obviously we’re proud of our kids for an amazing weekend,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “Coming here tonight with this kind of environment, playing a team that in all honesty has been playing the best in our conference…. Coming off of last night’s overtime win, [we knew] how difficult [tonight’s game] was going to be and it certainly proved to be exactly that.”
Ninety seconds after the Chambers triple, the task of making a play with the clock winding down fell to senior wing Wesley Saunders. With Bulldog standout guard Javier Duren between him and the basket, Saunders put the ball on the floor, driving into the middle of the paint before elevating and letting go a soft, short floater over Duren’s outstretched arm. The shot went through the hoop as Saunders landed near the left block, extending the Crimson lead to eight for the first time since the 8:15 mark of the first period.
With the Bulldogs struggling from the field—missing a layup and two jumpers in just a 90-second span—the rest of the game was an exercise in clock management and free throw shooting. The Crimson shot six-of-nine from the line in the final 49 seconds of the contest, including two crucial free throws from Saunders with six seconds to play and his team clinging to a two-point advantage.
The senior sunk both, and moments later the score went final. As Harvard jogged off the court, the typically-stoic Saunders looked towards his bench and cracked a smile. Saturday’s contest had been considered by many to be the must-win game of the year for Harvard, and it did just that, holding off one of the best Yale squads in recent memory.
“We knew that we were going to come in to a hostile environment and we were going to have to be ready to battle,” Saunders said. “And I think that everybody came out and showed that they were willing to fight, and I think we left it all out on the court.”
ICE COLD
For the highest-scoring team in the Ancient Eight, Saturday’s opening half marked a series of lows. In the first 20 minutes of play, Yale tallied more turnovers (five) than field goals (three), with its 13.6 percent shooting from the field leading to only 11 points by intermission.
While Yale scored the first basket of the game on a Matt Townsend jumper, the squad wouldn’t connect again from the field for almost seven minutes, when Greg Kelley sliced through the lane and laid the ball up in traffic.
In what was billed as a matchup of the Ivy’s best offensive team taking on the best defensive team, the Bulldogs did not play their part. Yale missed almost as many shots in the opening period—19—as it made in the game—20—with Saturday’s performance marking both Yale’s worst shooting outing of the season and the fewest points Harvard has allowed in a half since Amaker was appointed head coach.
“[On] offense we just did not do what we planned to do,” Yale coach James Jones said. “We didn’t move the ball well enough to be successful offensively, and when we did, we got good shots, we just didn’t do it enough tonight. We tried to hit a homerun on almost every play.”
LOOKING AHEAD
Last season, the Ivy title came down to the last weekend of the year. In what was essentially a two-team race for the crown, Harvard’s 70-58 win over Yale in New Haven earned the team its fourth-consecutive conference championship and punched its ticket to the NCAA Tournament.
With the Crimson’s win on Saturday, the last weekend of conference play in 2015 appears to hold similar stakes.
Coming into the contest, the Bulldogs owned a one-game lead over Harvard in the Ivy standings, as the latter was upset by Dartmouth on its home court two weeks ago. The Crimson needed to win on Saturday to stay in control of its title-chasing destiny, and the victory guarantees Harvard its fifth-consecutive league championship and fourth-straight trip to the Big Dance if it wins out.
Of course, Yale won’t make that easy for the Crimson, especially when it heads to Cambridge for the teams’ final matchup of the year in March. For a Yale program that hasn’t been to March Madness since 1962, that road swing could not have more on the line.
“We knew coming in that this was going to be a long season, and that’s what we’ve tried to preach—eyes on the prize,” explained Yale senior guard Javier Duren.
For Harvard, its win on Saturday sent them back to the top of conference standings, where it has spent much of the past half-decade. Thanks to its victory in New Haven, the rules of the game are simple for the Crimson from here on out: win and keep playing.
“It was a great game [tonight],” Saunders concluded. “[It was] a hard-fought game to the end, and that’s what it will always be like when the atmosphere is like this.”
And so it will be when Yale visits Harvard in just four short weeks.

Over the past year, Harvard has seen a massive influx of what some students call “duck boots.” These handmade, lumberjack-style boots from L. L. Bean are so popular that if you buy a pair of boots now, you can expect to be put on a waitlist of over 100,000 people. Here’s Flyby’s take on the boots’ recent rise to fame:
Nothing on this side of the eastern coastCan try to match your combinations ofSo confident in creaky leather shapeAnd all assured in your webbed rubber soles.
Oh, why do people love you so damn much?The stores can’t even deal with your demandYou have the insulating propertiesOf your old pset you never got to finish.
Our school is known for its diversityWith people from all different backgroundsYet every single kid here has youThat hideous old duck shoe.
Dear boots, oh man, you really bring me downYou’re ugly and far too pricey tooYou make all of the other boots so jealousI half expect your wearers to just quack.
Stop buying Bean Boots.
