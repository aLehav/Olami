After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first time I went through suicidality training, I almost couldn’t handle it. Student Mental Health Liaisons (SMHL) organizes this training each year to teach the group’s newest members how to recognize signs and symptoms of a person in need, and how to take appropriate action in the worst-case scenario. Most importantly, we learn how to be empathetic listeners in moments of crisis. The training is consequently heavy and difficult to sit through; toward the end of the training, we discuss several “at-risk” phrases that could indicate someone is planning to take their own life. For me, there was a sinking familiarity in these words. I couldn’t help but think, what if I had known?
In February 2012, a friend and teammate of mine committed suicide. He was a talented athlete, an incredibly kind, social person, and just 16 years old when he took his life. Looking back, I wonder—what if I had known his heart-wrenching, unbearable pain? What if I had known how to help him through it? What if I had been able to recognize the signs of his distress?
Of course, suicide is not always preventable. Each case is variable, and suicide is poorly understood scientifically. But there are ways to prevent the people around us from feeling so alone, so desperate, and so afraid of what the future will bring. As someone who has engaged with mental health as a researcher, peer counselor, and peer educator, I try to think carefully of ways to support members of our community who are in pain, and how to foster a culture of empathy. Based on these experiences, I know one thing for certain: In our role as friends, we serve as the first line of defense.
If you are a friend helping a friend, I am writing to tell you that you are not alone. You may not know where to start. You might feel scared to say the wrong thing, or stuck when you approach a friend who feels uncomfortable seeking out professional help. These situations are often difficult to handle; it can be particularly challenging to decide whether or not it is appropriate to notify a tutor or proctor that a fellow student is in distress, especially when a friend’s trust hangs in the balance.
Clearly, no one “correct” solution to such nuanced situations exists. To mitigate some of these concerns, there are six peer-counseling groups on campus that support not only students in need, but also those who find themselves supporting friends. These groups are trained to sift through your options and work together toward a solution, or to simply listen carefully and empathetically to the stresses associated with being there for a friend in pain.
In addition to these indispensable resources, several members of SMHL have developed a workshop over this past year to make reaching out to a friend in need seem less daunting. In the workshop, we discuss barriers to accessing resources that are specific to the Harvard community, and how we can begin to address them. Based on the experiences of the group, we work together to produce a customized “toolkit” of practical tips and suggestions for approaching a friend in distress, and finish the workshop by applying these concepts to realistic practice scenarios. This workshop will be offered to students within the House system next semester, as well as to specific groups that request it.
But these resources and initiatives can only be effective if they are put to use. With the stress of finals period fast approaching, I urge you to reach out early and often, to know whom to call, and to ask for support if necessary. The misconception that reaching out in a time of crisis is indicative of personal weakness is gravely dangerous. By being proactive on behalf of ourselves and our friends, we can reframe this narrative and view help seeking for what it is: A practical, responsible, and admirable alternative to suffering alone. Accordingly, these resources must be and feel accessible to all members of our community; it is our collective responsibility to ensure that this is the case, as the stakes are too high for it to be otherwise.
My personal “what if I had known” demons continue to haunt me. These words sting as I type them, serving as a painful reminder that I could and should have done more to reach out. Selfishly, writing this new SMHL workshop felt like an opportunity for me to fight the “what if I had known” dread; helping others know what I didn’t allows me to silence these thoughts temporarily.
But this relief is only ever temporary. A few weeks ago, when I helped facilitate the same suicidality training with our newest class of SMHL members, those all too familiar five words repeated themselves: What if I had known? I didn’t know, and I can’t change that. All I can do is work to change the narrative for someone else—that maybe my “what if I had known?” can become your “I’m so glad I did.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, the University’s Title IX Office updated its frequently asked questions page. When the document was originally released in October, student activists criticized it as “totally inaccessible,” and we asked whether or not the FAQs themselves needed FAQs.
The original version of the document read more like a policy change than the policy clarification it was presented as. It certainly did very little to reduce confusion on the issue. We remain firm in our belief that the University’s sexual assault policies should not be changed through the periodic updating of frequently asked questions.
While policy changes should not be revealed through FAQs, the idea of such a document is not inherently problematic. Policies on sexual assault are often opaque and complicated. We understand that much of this simply comes from the nature of the issue: Nothing about responding to sexual assault is or should be easy. At a minimum, however, Harvard’s policies should be presented clearly. Long documents containing nearly 50 questions and answers do not provide clarity; neither do two-page flowcharts with arrows pointing in every direction.
Despite our concerns with the document as a whole, the newly-added questions do contain valuable information that clarifies previously-opaque parts of the process. If the University is determined to update and clarify its policies through FAQs, it should do so regularly and in a way that takes into account many voices and perspectives.
Given this concern, we are glad to see that the Title IX office consulted with a variety of student groups before posting its latest version of the document. In the future, expanded outreach to additional groups would make information about sexual assault reporting more accessible to more students. While working with activists and student representatives is laudable, the issue cuts too deeply to stop there. The Title IX office and its representatives should be an active presence on campus.
Beyond the development of more accessible FAQs, complementary areas of policy also deserve attention. The final report of the Task Force on the Prevention of Sexual Assault called for the implementation of mandatory sexual assault training each year for all students at the College. We reiterate our firm belief that such training is an absolute necessity and must be implemented before the beginning of the next school year.

In Terrance Hayes’s title poem “Lighthead’s Guide to the Galaxy” of his book "Lighthead," the first poetry book I ever owned, he writes “I wish I could weep the way my teacher did as he read us / Molly Bloom’s soliloquy of yes.” Molly Bloom’s soliloquy is found in James Joyce’s Ulysses and is exactly one sentence: It’s five pages long, has zero punctuation, and choruses the word “yes.” I guess part of me always knew I was the type of girl who’d love the soliloquy, even before I reached any semblance of sexual maturity. Molly Bloom’s world seemed attainable, because I had a suspicion that I was almost there, that if I waited, I could be beautiful, and if not beautiful, I could be wild, and if not wild, I could be free. More than any other person I ever encountered, Molly Bloom felt things as if she were alive.
I was plagued with the distinctly feminine, distinctly modern, distinctly middle-class issue of choosing what type of girl I wanted to be. Later, I realized the model I had chosen—Molly—was problematic because she thought about men too much, was too sexual and submissive, and allowed herself to be constricted by the patriarchy. She was written by a male; a dead white male writer, canonized by other dead white males.
In his hour-long HBO special from 2000 entitled “Killin’ Them Softly,” comedian Dave Chappelle says, “The only thing in our society that bothers me the most is the way that men and women don’t get along no more.” He proceeds to talk about magazines killing chivalry and the different things men and women desire (women: material goods; men: a woman). I would agree with him if I wasn’t so heterosexually female in my experiences and my counterparts weren’t so heterosexually male. There are slips in our empathetic abilities that this newly-justiced society requiring correctness and inclusion and respect does not forgive, because even if we try, we will always imagine the other wrong.
To what extent can someone appropriate an experience, and does it matter how much that person cares? In fiction, writers are in this constant state of appropriation, of conscious bias. Jamie Stewart wrote in his last column, “What scares me is the potential for writers, including myself, to influence and guide discussions.”
I always, in some way, knew I was a spokesperson or representative for my race and gender. But I didn’t know there was an ethic to it. “The Hubei Boys” in The Adroit Journal was the first story I ever published. It was based on the three sentences my father told me about his childhood and five year-old faded memories of what his hometown was like. A review on the journal in Litbloom said, “The story, ‘The Hubei Boys’ by Christina Qiu is the most striking to me. I love its meditative tone and how it gives insight into the daily life of Chinese schoolboys and peasants.” I hadn’t meant for it to give any insight, because there was no research process. My fact base was solid as air. It’s been years since I revisited that story, but now that I have, I realize that Hubei is to me what Molly Bloom was to Joyce. My Hubei was imagined and loved. My Hubei was not the Hubei of dirt, but the Hubei of dreams. It was accepted instead of ridiculed because of the yellow of my skin. It was an objectification regardless.
A boy in my fiction-writing class asked why, in our class’s stories, guys mansplained and cars groaned like boys and men left their wives, and when I tried to blame my characters’ machismo on society, I remembered that I could be cruel too. At one point, I realized that most girls I knew had written or tried to write poetry, and most boys I knew didn’t. A lot of boy poets I met were either gay or wrote about impregnating their girlfriends in short, Hemingway-style phrases. They couldn’t imagine boys in real life being as cruel as they were in my stories, but maybe they were poets for a reason. I couldn’t imagine girls in real life wanting anyone as much as the girls in their stories, but maybe I just had a kind father.
At one point, I realized that all the girls I wrote about were prettier and cooler and dumber and sexier and badder and poorer and tougher and harder than I was, but it didn’t really matter because I wrote them pretty. My high school best friend asked if it was okay for an upper-middle class yellow girl who spent her Friday nights in SAT class, Saturdays in neuroscience classes at Columbia’s high school program, and other days on a piano bench, to write about a yellow girl who worked full-time at her parents’ restaurant.
Still, I am older now and less critical of the old me than I was even months ago. There is something to be said about the writing of the story itself, about a yellow-American girl incorrectly yet enthusiastically describing her father’s pre-immigrant life, the beauty and care and kindness in that. There is something to be said about a man describing his wife’s lovers in a way that makes her more beautiful than manipulative, more alive than demonic. There is something to be said about what we do when we love, when we let people occupy that space, when we think about them until we think them wrong. The bad boys in my stories, or the sweet girls in theirs.
Maybe it’s wrong to be angry at Joyce because Molly Bloom is caricatured and false; maybe it’s wrong to think of my Hubei as illegitimate. Maybe that’s the tragedy, those incongruities after empathy, after we have considered and wrongly considered the other side. But maybe this was what made Molly Bloom so beautiful to me. She was alive. She took things easy. She was powerful the way only dreams can be.

Christina M. Qiu '19 lives in Matthews Hall. Her column appears on alternate Mondays.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sixty-seven percent of women in computer science courses this year said they had one or fewer years of programming experience before arriving at Harvard, compared to only 41 percent of men, according to data collected by the student group Women in Computer Science.
The group presented the results of a year-long effort to collect data on the gender gap in computer science at an event Friday after having surveyed more than 900 undergraduates to analyze students’ experience with Harvard's Computer Science Department.
Female computer science concentrators with eight years of programming experience report being as confident in their skills as their male peers with zero to one year of programming experience. While 47.5 percent of women respondents reported the process of recruiting for jobs and internships as “very stressful,”only 27 percent of men reported said the same.
Computer science professor Margo I. Seltzer ’83 also presented results from a survey of students in introductory computer science classes. Seltzer found that the ratio of men to women who take the introductory course CS50 is two to one. The ratio in CS50’s spring follow-up course, CS51, is three to one. Another introductory course, CS 61: “Systems Programming and Machine Organization,” has a five-to-one male-female ratio.
“What I’ve been looking into, is this intro sequence and where we’re losing the women, where the ratios change and trying to come up with some hypothesis so that the next round of data collection we can get the right information to figure out what’s going on” Seltzer said.
Alongside the data presentation, a panel of computer science professors highlighted how the study of computer science could improve at Harvard.
Computer science professor Radhika Nagpal emphasized blind grading, a process by which students’ problem sets would remain anonymous, as one possible response to implicit biases and create a more equitable experience.
“There is a lot of evidence that suggests that we are biased in many ways, we use names, we use assumptions about them, even people who don’t want to make mistakes, make mistakes. So, one way to stop that is to take every opportunity we have to remove names, do things, and then put the names back,” Nagpal said. “It’s the big intro classes where it’s most effective and I think most needed.”
Students who intend to concentrate in Computer Science also expressed their support for tackling the larger issue of gender inequality in the field of technology.
“Seeing the data presented right in front of me, I think that was an eye opener because I am not the only one feeling that way, and a lot of the other women are going through the same experience,” prospective computer science concentrator and WiCS marketing director Yong L. Dich ’19 said.
Other students said they were heartened by faculty members’ focus on gender inequities in the field.
“It’s really cool to see how many of the CS professors were at this event and how committed they are to it,” Alex Wendland ’19 said. “ It sounded resoundingly that they are all very invested in fixing this gender gap problem.”
The event also marked WiCS’ launch of an online portal to access the survey data.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust signed an agreement Friday with Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James to formally recognize the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps at Harvard, ending a decades long separation between the two institutions born from Vietnam War-era protest.
In a Loeb House ceremony replete with a rendition of the national anthem and an Air Force color guard, Faust completed Harvard’s symbolic reconciliation with ROTC; Harvard welcomed Navy ROTC back to campus in 2011, and Army ROTC in 2012. Once a major presence on campus, the ROTC programs from each of the branches left Harvard after widespread student protest in the late 1960s.
“Today we complete our effort to bring the full complement of ROTC programs back to our campus through the full and formal recognition of the Air Force Reserve Officer’s Training Corps,” Faust said.
While much of Air Force ROTC’s training and programming will likely continue to take place at MIT, some activities may now take place on Harvard’s campus, according to cadets in the program. Recognition may also help grow Air Force ROTC, which, with four Harvard students, is the smallest of Harvard’s ROTC programs.
Zander E. Farrow ’16, an Air Force ROTC cadet, said after the ceremony that recognizing the program amounts to honoring the dedication of the individual cadets who participate.
“It’s formally recognizing the hard work and the training we’ve put into the program and also our dedication to serve six years in the military afterwards—at least that’s six years for me,” Farrow said. In her remarks, Faust traced the history of ROTC at Harvard and thanked the cadets for their service. 
“We honor today the courage, devotion, and skill of women and men who continue to regard military service as public service and whose numbers I hope increase in the years ahead,” Faust said.
James discussed the mission of the Air Force and the important role students will play in the military.
“Leveraging the best talent that America has to offer is, is the secret weapon of the United States,” James said. “It’s even more important than that training and that technology and those concepts of operations.”
Students in each of Harvard’s ROTC programs were joined by University and military leaders at the event.

A small crowd of students from Harvard Extension School gathered on the steps of University Hall Saturday afternoon to protest the degree name that will appear on each of their diplomas, arguing for a certificate more representative of their experience at the school.
The Extension School, Harvard’s division of continuing education, currently grants Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in “Extension Studies” to all of its graduates, regardless of their academic concentrations. The Harvard Extension Degree Change Initiative, the student-led group that organized Saturday’s rally, called for the Extension School to award diplomas that better reflect the academic programs that students complete.
“People feel like their experience is diminished and not dignified, that the work they have done is not reflected in the diploma,” Stephanie Martins, chair of the Degree Change Initiative, said. “It’s also a problem in the professional world, when you apply for a job and you have a degree in ‘Extension Studies’—the Office of Career Services has to have a workshop on how to present your degree in a way that makes sense.”
Martins, a Bachelor’s degree candidate and Government concentrator at the Extension School, said the Degree Change Initiative has reached out to nearly 4,000 Extension School students and has gathered around 1,500 signatures for a petition. Organizing Extension School students is particularly challenging, Martins said, because many take classes online, work full time jobs, or have families of their own.
At the rally, about 15 students from the Boston area and beyond held signs featuring the names of their own concentrations, such as “International Relations” or “Mathematics,” written beneath the crossed-out phrase “Extension Studies.” Some students held posters that read, “What is Extension Studies?” and “Board of Overseers: Hello From the Other Side.”
The students discussed their shared experiences as candidates for degrees in “Extension Studies.” Many said they felt that the degree had not been clearly or appropriately advertised to them before enrolling in the Extension School. Some said that the “Extension Studies” diplomas were reflective of the Extension School’s treatment as “second-class” within Harvard.
“I want the Extension School to be one of 12 [degree-granting schools at Harvard], not a second-class school,” David W. Montgomery, a student who traveled from Vermont for the rally, said.
“It’s really just a class-based distinction between people who can pay for expensive tuition and people who can’t,” Matthew J. Bach, a Master’s degree candidate at the Extension School, said.
The Harvard Extension Degree Change initiative has worked closely with Huntington D. Lambert, dean of Harvard’s Division of Continuing Education who overseers the Extension School. According to Martins, Lambert has worked to get an appointment with University President Drew G. Faust, but has been unable to meet with the Board of Overseers about the issue. At a town hall meeting, Lambert said the degrees granted by the Extension School are “inconsistent with what the programs actually are,” but acknowledged that changing the name is “going to take time.”
“Harvard is very comfortable with us being the Extension School,” Lambert said. “We’re going to look at how we go about changing the names of the degrees, but I’ve decided that we’ll also look at how we can bring real meaning to what our degrees are called.”

For a city of just over 100,00 residents, Cambridge boasts a surprising number of media outlets dedicated to covering local news, with little if any paid staff.
Publications like the Cambridge Chronicle, Cambridge Day, and the Cambridge Civic Journal report on the City Council and neighborhood events thanks to a belief in the importance of local news, despite their limited resources and the plethora of news about universities and startups.
“There will always be a need for local news because in a lot of situations the national and international media outlets are kind of chasing the same news story,” Amy Saltzman, editor of the Cambridge Chronicle, said. “The [Boston] Globe covers Cambridge to a limited extent, and the stories they do are great, but they’re not as locally focused on Cambridge as we are.”
The Cambridge Chronicle was founded in 1846 and employs a small staff of two reporters, one of whom also serves as the editor. While the Chronicle is delivered weekly in print, it “serves as a daily” on its partner website Wicked Local, Saltzman said. The small size of the editorial staff has made work difficult for Saltzman, who said she has to make tough choices on which stories to follow.
“The hardest part about doing Cambridge is just that there is so much going on. I think even with more staff it would still be complicated,” Saltzman said. “You really kind of have to pick and choose what stories you chase.”
For Marc H. Levy, the founder and editor of Cambridge Day, an online-only Cambridge news source, balancing a full-time job and reporting can prove even more challenging.
“The way I work is unfortunately limited by having to do a day job,” Levy said. “Being online only doesn’t put you in front of as many eyes automatically.”
However, despite challenges, Levy is optimistic about the staying power of local news.
“Any news medium is going to face the problem of writing about things they think matter versus writing about the things people care about.” Levy said. “The funny thing about news is everyone wants their local news at some point.”
One of the most popular topics among Cambridge residents is the Cambridge City Council, Saltzman and Levy said.
“In Cambridge people are really drawn to the City Council and the city government,” Saltzman said. “They keep their eyes open to what’s happening locally.”
One such person who keeps his eyes locked on the City Council is Robert Winters, a Harvard Extension School mathematics professor. The co-host of the locally broadcast news show Cambridge Inside Out and creator of the Cambridge Civic Journal, Winters is a familiar face for those who follow city politics.
With the motto “Don’t follow leaders. Watch the parking meters,” Winters said the goal of the Cambridge Civic Journal is to be a “central repository as well as a user’s guide to citizenship.” He refuses to accept donations for the site.
For Winters and Levy, Cambridge City politics are ingrained in their memory, which is helpful for covering local government.
“The good news is that I’ve been a part of the community for a while now and I have some context. I have some institutional memory,” Levy said.
Since 1997, Winters has been posting on the Cambridge Civic Journal and even had a brief stint as a City Council candidate. Nowadays he is well-known among councillors and citizens as a source of information during election season. The Civic Journal features detailed candidate pages during Cambridge’s biannual elections.
The Crimson also covers local news, and bills itself as Cambridge's only “breakfast-table daily newspaper.”
Winters said he hopes that in the coming years more people become invested in Cambridge local news to expand the reach of organizations like the Chronicle, Cambridge Day and the Civic Journal, and even The Crimson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 24, 2016, at 10:10 p.m.
For months, national media outlets have picked up stories on Harvard’s tense relationship with final clubs—and many have placed particular focus on Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana’s recent efforts to make the historically male organizations go co-ed.
Last week, Khurana, who has for the most part remained silent about the national media attention, broadly criticized popular media outlets’ coverage of final clubs.
“In some cases I don’t think the media accurately characterizes our areas of focus and is actually sharing things like the task force report and its specific areas of concern,” Khurana said in an interview, referring to a recent University-wide set of recommendations for preventing sexual assault on campus and criticizing outlets for only choosing specific details of the report to emphasize. Khurana also argued that outside of Harvard, reporters do not necessarily understand the school's history with the clubs and the College's “changing student body.”
When Harvard released the sexual assault prevention report, multiple outlets focused on its sharp condemnation of final clubs. Decrying the final clubs as “vestige[s] of gender inequity” and emblematic of “sexual entitlement,” the report called on Harvard to regulate the organizations, which have not had official affiliation with the College for decades. A subcommittee of the task force even recommended that the College bar undergraduates from joining final clubs.
Outlets including the Washington Post, the Boston Globe, and Jezebel highlighted one particular statistic from Harvard’s report on sexual assault prevention. The report stated that 47 percent of female college seniors participating in “final club activities” had experienced some form of unwelcome sexual contact during their time on campus.
Khurana, who has refused to detail specific plans for regulating or sanctioning single-sex organizations, emphasized the importance of “sharing aspects of the recommendations again in totality rather than soundbites.”
Even prior to the report’s release, many national media outlets published stories on the final clubs after The Crimson broke news that the Spee invited women to participate in its punch process last fall. A headline from the The New York Times read that the invitations sent out to women to punch caused a “Gender Barrier at Harvard [to Fall].”
Later in the semester, when the Fox club struggled to quell internal division after its undergraduates admitted women into the organization, many outlets again put the all-male groups in the spotlight.
More recently, the graduate president of a final club broken decades of silence to criticize the College’s scrutiny of the all-male groups, and some national outlets have published staff editorials on the matter.
Nearly two weeks ago, Porcellian Club Graduate President Charles M. Storey ’82 criticized the College’s actions against final clubs and the College’s handling of sexual assault, calling for Harvard affiliates to “come together and ask the College to protect freedom of association at Harvard.”
After the The Crimson broke the news, a number of global media outlets, such as the New York Times, the Boston Globe, the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post, jumped on the story, creating a media frenzy around Storey’s remarks.
In the aftermath, the Wall Street Journal editorial board criticized any efforts to ban undergraduate enrollment in the final clubs.
“The only crime the clubs have committed is being out of sync with modern progressive sensibilities, even if Harvard’s feminist focus seems a little out-of-date in this era of proliferating gender identities,” they wrote.
Khurana argued that few national outlets understand complexities of the issue at hand.
“Outside of Harvard, people don’t understand our specific histories, they don’t necessarily have the full appreciation for Harvard’s history with respect to the strides it’s made over the years in becoming a changing structure,” Khurana said. “Many people don’t understand our changing student body and its needs and the changing nature of House life.”
“I think one of the things that we continually are doing is, first, emphasizing our shared goals and common ground,” Khurana said of the final clubs.
Earlier this month, Khurana floated a potential sanction in a private meeting, suggesting that the College could bar undergraduates in final clubs from holding athletic captaincies or receiving fellowships. He also plans to submit the College’s plan of action for sexual assault prevention by the end of the semester.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Steve Aoki opened his set at Yardfest on Sunday not by throwing his characteristic cake but, rather, by dropping the F bomb.
“I’m fucking in motherfucking Harvard!” the electro dance DJ yelled as hundreds of denim, neon, and spandex-clad students cheered him on. “We’re not here to study right now, because you don’t fucking study at an Aoki show!”

As neon lights flashed and the bassline throbbed, Aoki urged concertgoers to put up their hands, jump, and, at one point in the evening, start a riot.
Alternating slow and fast beats, Aoki managed to hype up the crowd, and they reflected his energy.
“Steve Aoki is so fun, and I’m so glad he’s here,” Kristina R. Li ’18 said during the concert.
Sean T. Reynolds, a college sophomore, traveled from Northeastern University to attend the concert. “I was invited, and I like him, so I said ‘why not?’” Reynolds said.
Before Aoki took to the stage—or, in his case, an elevated light-up platform, flanked by several outlets that spouted steam at well-timed intervals—undergraduates squealed and mingled in Tercentenary Theatre. Balancing paper plates stacked high with burgers, salads, and watermelon, students bounced across the Yard, shaking their hips to ambient music and clutching onto their friends.
“Do you even lift, bro?” one man said to his friends while waiting in line for complimentary cones of Richardson’s ice cream. “I’m not counting calories tonight!” his companion chuckled back.
Back on stage, Aoki took his own advice, throwing his hands up and down, in time with the ever-present bassline. His choice of music for the evening ranged from, “I Like to Move It,” of DreamWorks’ “Madagascar” fame, to Rihanna’s “Bitch Better Have My Money” to the interluding dubstep beats. And voiceover: “Kim Kardashian is dead,” an electronified voice bellowed.
Behind Aoki, ever the hypeman, jumbo screens pulsed with light, alternating between images of “AOKI” in vibrant block letters and a montage of close-ups of his face.
“Harvard, do you want to be in my Snapchat story?” Aoki yelled, as the steam columns issued a new breath of smoke. The crowd cheered and waved, while Aoki panned his phone across the sea of bodies, capturing the moment on social media.
Aoki’s electropop spectacle capped off the annual concert, which started earlier in the afternoon with performances by two student groups, The Lighthouse Keepers and Protein Shake. Prior to the music events, undergraduate Houses—grouped by neighborhood—hosted block parties with inflatable bouncy castles, food, and drink.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 25, 2016, at 12:57 a.m.
In response to concerns that clubs may be misrepresenting information, the Undergraduate Council’s Finance Committee wrote a formal procedure Sunday for conducting inquiries into student organizations accused of dishonesty in their UC grant applications.
The committee discussed the procedure during its Thursday meeting, and will use it for the first time this week in an inquiry into Bach Society Orchestra. The club had funding for its fourth concert revoked last week when the Finance Committee determined that the date of the concert was different from the date reported on the organization’s grant application. The concert takes place during reading period, when organizations are ineligible to receive UC funding.
UC Finance Committee Chair William A. Greenlaw ’17 expressed concern last week that the organization may have “willfully misrepresented” information in its application. Greenlaw has also suggested that clubs may be intentionally overstating event attendance in order to receive more funding.
According to UC Rules Committee Chair Daniel R. Levine ’17, an inactive Crimson editor, the committee has the authority to disqualify student groups from receiving funding if there is “evidence of dishonesty.” However, the committee had not previously established a formal procedure for determining decisions about disqualifications.
“We've never had to be judge before,” Greenlaw said.
During last Thursday’s committee meeting, representatives outlined a procedure for conducting inquiries.
“If we have reason to believe an organization has been dishonest, we can open a case,” Greenlaw said, describing the new procedure. “It involves soliciting a statement from them, written or in person. We weigh the evidence. Based on the evidence, we make a recommendation.”
Because any committee decision to allocate or not allocate UC funds would require approval by the Council at large, the Finance Committee’s recommendation on whether to suspend funding would face a vote by the full Council, Greenlaw said.
During the Finance Committee’s meeting, representatives extensively discussed what punishment would be appropriate for student groups found “guilty” as a result of an inquiry.
Representatives agreed that some punishment would be necessary to deter future attempts to defraud the Council.
“The message that [not having a punishment] would send is that it’s worth it to try to screw the system, to play the game, to find loopholes and see if we don’t notice,” Elm Yard representative Evan M. Bonsall ’19 said.
“You want it to be a punishment that disincentives people from gaming the system,” Greenlaw added.
The committee ultimately determined that student organizations found to be dishonest will be barred from receiving funding for a number of weeks.
“The punishment must be proportional to how much they attempted to game the public trust by,” Greenlaw said.
Some representatives expressed concern that such a procedure may punish clubs for honest mistakes. Oak Yard representative Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 said the Finance Committee should give the benefit of the doubt to organizations that may have made unintentional errors in their applications.
Greenlaw said the committee will formally vote to approve the procedure on Monday.
As of press time, Bach Society Orchestra production manager Juhwan Seo ’17 wrote that it would be “premature” to comment on the inquiry because he said the group has “yet to be notified from anyone at the UC” on the matter. In a statement to The Crimson last week, Bach Society Orchestra’s management wrote that “while this was certainly an oversight, characterizing it as ‘dishonesty’ would be unfair.”
“This is going to be a precedent-setting case,” Pforzheimer House representative Neel Mehta ’18 said.
The committee plans to adjudicate the inquiry during its meeting on Wednesday.
“Any further punishment, if it's forthcoming, will be determined after we view the evidence and we hear from the people at the Bach Society. It's just a matter of due process,” Bonsall said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With little time left in the regular season, the Harvard and Radcliffe heavyweight and lightweight teams looked to leave its mark in the water.
Men’s Heavyweights
With the team hungry to avenge its close loss to Princeton last week and position itself well against its rivals in the upcoming tournament play, the No. 5 men’s heavyweight team’s path back to success ran through stiff competition in No. 12 Navy and No. 13 Penn.
In the varsity 8 race, the Crimson’s quick and clean start allowed the boat to a four-seat lead over the nearest boat, Navy. Towards the middle of the race, Harvard made moves to further increase its lead to seven seats, but, as the crew found last weekend, there is always plenty of time for a last minute push from a team to overtake it. Penn did just that in the last 500m of the course, making a move to reduce its Ivy rival’s lead; but the Crimson boat responded by quickening its stroke to hold onto its lead and finish at 4:54.5, half a second ahead of Penn. The Midshipmen finished open water behind at 6:01.4
With this win, the team takes home Adams Cup for the 18th consecutive year, and the 53rd out of 80 years.
The 2V and 3V races also saw Harvard win again, this time by a wider margin. In the 4V and 5V races, BU, which joined for those races, edged out the Crimson.
With these wins, the Crimson amassed enough points to also win the Clothier trophy.
Men’s Lightweights
The No. 5 lightweights also faced off against Navy, but also competed with Delaware  on the Severn River.
Unlike its heavyweight counterpart, though, the lightweight team could not overcome a strong No. 6 Navy team, which took home the Haines Cup for the first time since 2008.
Facing a strong tailwind throughout the course, the Crimson and Midshipmen V8 boats were in close competition right until the end of the race, where Navy managed to pull ahead and finish at 5:47.4. The Crimson stopped the clock less than a second later at 5:48.5. The Blue Hens came in third at 5:54.5.
The 2V race was a close call as well, this time with Harvard edging out Navy in its only win of the day. Navy took the 3V, 4V, and 5V races.

Women’s Heavyweights
The No. 18 Radcliffe heavyweights ended the regular season on the Housatonic River. In this race, the team looked to take down Ancient Eight rival No. 6 Yale, which had never lost a race at home.
“Yale is one of biggest rivalries so we were super excited to race them… and we’ve been using each race this season to figure out how to get faster...from weekend to weekend,” senior Mary Carmack said.
Despite rain, a tailwind, and a strong start by Yale, the Black and White kept up pace in the varsity eight race for the first 500 meters of the race. Over the middle 1,000 meters, though, Yale began to pull away with a quicker stroke. Radcliffe made a move, but it was not enough to hand Yale it’s first home loss, finishing 1.8 seconds behind the Bulldogs at 6:09.5.
Yale went on to sweep the rest of the races.
“Unfortunately we didn’t win today but across all of our boats we were excited about finding more speed, and hopefully we will be able to use today to get faster for the Ivy League championships,” Carmack said.
Women’s Lightweights
The No. 4 lightweight team hosted cross-town rivals No. 2 BU and No. 5 MIT in the Beanpot in the last home race of the season.
For the Black and White, the race was all about cutting down the margin by which BU had won in previous matchups.
“I think when we came into this race, we knew it would be really close, but we were hoping that we could maybe beat them because this is our last chance to see them before Sprints,” senior Kristen Faulkner said.
A strong start by the Terriers put it ahead by seven seats early in the V8 race. From there, it could not be caught. BU finished at 6:48.1, and the Black and White finished three seconds later at 6:51.3. BU dominated the other races on the day, except for the novice four race, which Radcliffe won.
Despite losing the Beanpot for the first time, the Radcliffe team did come away with some hardware: it won the Muri Cup.
“This week what we’ve been really focusing on was that power-per-stroke, and I think we did a really good job with that this race,” Faulkner said. “I think that it gives us the confidence that we can turn that into the championship next weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time in the history of the Harvard women’s rugby team, the Ivy League 7s Championship trophy is coming to Cambridge. This weekend, the Crimson competed against Dartmouth, Princeton, Yale, Brown, Penn, and Columbia at the Ancient Eight Championships in Princeton, N.J.. This was Harvard’s first Ivy League championship in rugby, and the win earned the team a spot at the National Championships in North Carolina this May.
The tournament was split into three- and four-team pools, the Crimson playing against Brown and Yale in Pool A. The team went 4-0 on the day, beating Princeton in the semifinal then Brown in the championship game. This was the first time in program history the team took down Princeton or Brown.
“Playing as a team helped us throughout the entire tournament,” freshman Caitlin Weigel said. “When someone got a breakaway, whoever was closest was there in support. We were constantly communicating on offense and defense and encouraging one another during stoppages.”
HARVARD 17, BROWN 5
As the saying goes, defense wins championships. That was the case for the Crimson this weekend. On the day, Harvard let up a grand total of 15 points to their opponents. Propelled by a second-half tries from junior Claire Collins and senior Aniebiet Abasi, the Crimson pulled away from an otherwise close game against the Bears.
“We did a great job,” sophomore Dalton Youngblood said. “We kept the wall in front of the ball. We’re moving quickly, a lot of communication on the field. We were able to definitely stop a lot of their players because of the connections we have.”
The opening try of the match was scored by Youngblood, assisted by sophomore co-captain Maya Learned. Youngblood converted to put Harvard up 7-0 before Brown’s Kiki Morgan matched with her own try. Harvard was up 7-5 at half before pulling away in the second period.
HARVARD 29, YALE 0
The oldest college sports rivalry in the country was renewed this weekend, and this time, the Crimson got the better of the Bulldogs. Harvard jumped out to an early 12-0 lead, led by Weigel. She continued her dominant sevens play as she downed back-to-back tries to open the second half, adding to her team-high try total.
“We’re being set up really well by our teammates,” Weigel said. “We wouldn’t be anything if we didn’t have our teammates getting the ball off of kickoff and...making huge hits.”
HARVARD 12, BROWN 5
In the first of the Crimson’s two matches against Brown on the day, Harvard found themselves down 5-0 after the Bears’ Morgan downed the opening try. However, that would be the only time the Crimson were down all day. Weigel answered with a try and conversion, putting the Crimson up 7-5 late in the first half.
Though Weigel finds the endzone frequently, her presence on the field draws enough attention from defenders to create space for her teammates. Harvard was able to extend its lead in the second half as Abasi downed her first try of the day off space created by Weigel.
HARVARD 15, PRINCETON 5
Three games, three opening tries scored by Weigel. In the Crimson’s first playoff game against the host Tigers, Weigel was able to open up scoring on an assist by Collins late in the first half. Collins then got the hockey assist, setting up Learned to dish the assist to Youngblood early in the second period. Princeton was able to bring the game with one try in the second half, but Harvard scored a goal to put itself up by double-digits on its way to the championship.
“It sets a huge precedent...going forward,” Youngblood said. “It tells people that we aren’t just an underdog anymore. We are a team that has worked hard and prepared, and we’ve worked as a team. Because of that, it shows.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Looking to qualify for the Ivy League tournament for the third consecutive year, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team came out with a purpose on Saturday afternoon for its Senior Day matchup against No. 16/20 Cornell. But Cornell easily closed out the comfortable, 11-3 victory.
The Crimson fired six shots at the Big Red goal in the first eight minutes, while holding its opponents to just one.
Freshman midfielder Keeley MacAfee converted one of these six shots to put Harvard on the board first, slotting home after handling a well-placed far-post pass from fellow midfielder, sophomore Julia Glynn. With a 5-0 record when scoring first before Saturday, the Crimson hoped MacAfee’s goal boded well for the rest of the game.
Cornell had different ideas, however, and proceeded to score eight unanswered goals. The Big Red defense prevented Harvard from getting back on the scoreboard until the 12:43 mark of the second half, when the game was well in hand. The Crimson added another goal before the final whistle sounded, but it was all for naught.
Harvard (7-6, 3-3 Ivy) must now wait until its final game of the season for a chance to clinch a postseason berth. It will face off against Yale with control of its own destiny; a win puts the team in Ivy tournament while a loss would mean that the Bulldogs or Dartmouth would take its place.
The Big Red (11-3, 5-1), meanwhile, continued its strong campaign and kept pace atop the conference standings with Penn and Princeton. The win over the Crimson snapped a two-game losing streak, giving the team much-needed momentum heading into its final contest of the season against the Quakers.
Cornell will look to utilize the same possession-based attack that helped it overcome Harvard, as the Big Red’s patience and precision on offense was the difference in the game. Despite being outshot overall by the Crimson, Cornell fired 18 of its 19 shots on goal. Harvard, on the other hand, managed 23 in total but only 13 were on frame.
“The defense played a larger portion of the game today and naturally, they were getting tired,” Crimson senior midfielder Alexis Nicolia said. “Our offense was struggling to put our shots away which was unfortunate for the defense when they would make great stands.”
Harvard co-captain and goalie Kelly Weis made several impressive saves, but could not keep the Big Red from taking a 4-1 lead into halftime. Cornell junior attacker Catherine Ellis scored two of her team’s four goals during this period, and was part of a balanced attack that saw four players tally at least two on the afternoon.
At that point in the contest, however, the Crimson still boasted more shots and were also winning a majority of the draw controls.
“We didn't make any changes in our game plan [at halftime] because we were getting good looks on the first half,” junior midfielder Megan Hennessey said. “We just emphasized getting our shots on cage and putting some more pressure on from behind.”
The second half started much like the first ended, however, as the Big Red scored another four straight goals to put the contest out of reach. Junior attacker Jamie Dickson punctuated the run with two goals in the span of 39 seconds early in the half, taking the air out of Harvard’s comeback hopes. Dickson went on to finish with a game-high four goals.
Cornell also continued to collect the majority of ground balls in the second half, keeping the ball away from the Crimson offense. Big Red junior midfielder Kristy Gilbert picked up a total of four on the afternoon, while no player on Harvard had more than one.
“Going forward, we want to remain confident both on attack and defense,” Hennessey said. We’ll just work on the small things like ground balls.”
Nicolia finally scored the Crimson’s second at the 12:53 mark of the final frame, and co-captain and midfielder Audrey Todd collected the team’s final goal several minutes later. It was too little, too late for Harvard, however.
“We just had to start putting our shots away more today,” Nicolia said. “I thought everything else was going well and what we worked on this week we were doing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After missing out on the Ivy League Tournament last season, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team entered 2016 with one primary goal: getting back into the top half of the conference standings and earning a berth in the postseason.
On Saturday, the Crimson had a chance to accomplish just that with a win over visiting Princeton. Attackman Will Walker, one of eight senior starters looking to extend their careers beyond the regular season, knew he and his classmates had to deliver for Harvard to clinch a spot in the tournament.
With the pressure mounting after a first half in which nothing could separate the two squads, Walker took the game into his own hands in the second. Following a two-goal haul in the third quarter that broke the 7-7 deadlock, Walker received the ball again on the left side of the field with 10:26 remaining in the fourth. He shook both defenders guarding him and fooled Tigers sophomore goalie Tyler Blaisdell as well before calmly slotting the ball home.
Walker’s impressive solo effort capped a 5-0 run in which he alone scored three times. Princeton never recovered, and the Crimson cruised to a 16-12 win. Harvard (7-6, 3-2 Ivy) secured a spot in the conference tournament with the victory, while Princeton (4-8, 1-4) is officially eliminated from contention.
Both teams remain in the same positions in the standings that they were entering Saturday, at fourth and fifth respectively, but the Crimson now has a two-game advantage on the Tigers with only one game left to play for both squads. If Harvard can defeat Yale next weekend, it can move into a tie for second place.
“I’m really proud of how the senior class stepped up yesterday, especially on Senior Day and with a tournament bid on the line,” Crimson coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “And the way the underclassmen responded too, it’s a testament to what the whole team thinks of this year’s seniors.
Before Walker’s outburst in the second half, Harvard had a difficult time finding separation from Princeton. Although the Crimson never trailed during the first two quarters, the Tigers also never fell behind by more than two goals and managed to tie the score at 7-7 before halftime.
While Harvard saw six players contribute to the scoreline in the first half, Princeton was paced by junior attackman Gavin McBride, who found the back of the net four times. Mcbride’s final goal came with only 0:03 remaining in the second quarter, seemingly giving the Tigers the momentum as the teams headed into intermission.
“We didn’t want to change anything at halftime, because we were getting the chances we wanted” Walker said. “Second half, only difference was our middies pushed the ball up the field faster and we were able to get some goals in transition to get us rolling.”
Walker stole the show, and with it, the momentum, with his sharp play at the beginning of the third quarter. In one sequence, he took the ball in front of the goal with just a defender to beat. After faking right, he whipped a shot between his legs and past Blaisdell. Walker would finish with a game-high, and career-high, six goals on the afternoon.
“He [Walker] started the season at midfield, but he’s built up really good chemistry in attack with Morgan and Devin” Wojcik said. “It’s one of the reasons I coach, to see players develop even later on in their time here.”
Walker’s performance gave the Crimson something to rely on in a game that saw tempers run high on both sides. The contest saw a total of 14 infractions, with Princeton committing 10 of them. Harvard scored on four of these man-up chances, while the Tigers only converted one of their four opportunities.
Princeton put up a challenge at the end of the game with three goals between the 3:01 and 1:52 marks of the fourth quarter, but a double-infraction with 1:43 remaining ended any hopes of a miracle comeback.
“It was a pretty chippy game, but we’re using to playing physical every day in practice,” Walker said. “And we knew we had to stay focused because of the opportunity in front of us. In the end, we just wanted to make sure we got the job done.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Crimson, after competing in New Jersey in the Princeton Invitational returned to the Garden state to compete for the Ivy League Championship. After 3 consistent days down at Metedeconk National Golf Club in Jackson, NJ, the Crimson men’s golf team captured the Ivy League Championship for the first time in 41 years, its third in program history. This is the first year in school history that both the men and women’s golf team captured the coveted Ivy League Championship in the same year.
“We’re definitely feeling great,” captain Rohan Ramnath said. “We put in a lot of hard work this season and in seasons past and we’re really happy to see it come to fruition.”
Despite slightly windy condition on the course in the first day of competition, Harvard played with the same poise they displayed all season. Playing its first round on Friday, Harvard gave itself a cushion as the team scored a 292, nine strokes under their stiffest competition of the weekend, Dartmouth.  Harvard would go into the second round atop the leaderboard.
Harvard sophomore Gregory Royston carded an even round 72 in the first day of competition. The South African set the tone for his teammates as they had impressive days as well. Junior Daniel De La Garza and freshman Aurian Capart were only one stroke away as Ramnath was just two.
“It was a matter of committing to the shot and playing well,” Royston said. “We had a great group of guys and it worked out great.”
The Crimson going into Saturday with the comfortable lead looked to stay in the leading position. Despite the impressive play by both Cornell and Yale, who scored 305 and 302, respectively, the Crimson still had a lead at the conclusion of round two. After 18 holes Harvard extended its lead to 10 strokes, Yale coming in second with 608 and Dartmouth and Cornell tied for third with 610. Despite scoring 306, 14 strokes higher than its first round, Harvard’s cushion from the round one proved to be helpful
On the final day of competition Dartmouth matched the score from the first round to give themselves a final score of 911. However, that would not prove enough, as the Crimson would score 309 on the day, to give itself a final score of 907.
“We all stuck to our game plans and had really great approach every single day,” Ramnath said. “We really gave everything, with every shot we had out there and that made the difference.”
Capart came up big for Harvard as he finished first for the team and fourth in the whole tournament with a score of 224. With the performance Capart received First Team All-Ivy honors. The Belgium native finished top 15 in par three, four and five.
“It’s awesome to have young guys step up like that, especially on a high pressure stage,” Ramnath said. “I think it’s a testament to how talented Aurian is and how hard he worked all year.”
Royston had an impressive outing as well as he finished seventh in the contest with a final tally of 226. De La Garza was among the four golfers tied for 10th as a finished with a score of 230. Both Royston and De La Garza earned Second Team All-Ivy honors with their performances.
Junior Robert Deng (+15, 231) and Ramnath (+17, 233) rounded out the group placing tied for 14th and tied for 18th, respectively.

Qualification complete.
In the final weekend before the beginning of championship season, the Harvard sailing team posted three top-ten finishes in its co-ed events, highlighted by a victory in the 81st Boston Dinghy Challenge Cup.  The women’s team continued the trend with a ninth place finish at the New England Women’s Championship, allowing the squad to qualify for ICSA Women’s National Semifinal Championship in May.
“The team performed very well as a whole,” said junior skipper Juan Carlos Perdomo. “We were happy to have won the BDCCC and be in good shape for the qualifiers next weekend. Also, it was great for some of the less experienced individuals to get to start at some of the big inter-sectionals such as the Admirals Cup.”
BOSTON DINGHY CHALLENGE CUP
In the local tri-divisional inter-conference regatta jointly hosted by the Crimson and MIT, the Crimson was able to hoist the trophy for the first time since 2009.  Racing in FJs against 16 other competitors, Harvard’s third place finishes in the A and B-Divisions, and fourth place finish in the C-Division were enough to produce the result.
“I think we exceeded expectations,” Perdomo said. “We were able to really sail well at all of our events and feel confident for the end of the season.”
Of the mere 152 total points the team produced, 53 of those came from senior skipper Marek Zaleski and junior crew Julia Lord in the A-Division.  In the B-Division, fellow co-captains, sophomore skipper Nick Sertl and junior crew Nomin-Erdene Jagdagdorj posted 41 points, while Perdomo and freshman crew Catherine Tang accrued 58 points in the C-Division.  No group had more than two races in which they finished outside the top-ten.
Even though the conditions were far from ideal with ineffectual breezes ruling the weekend, the group was able to manage.
“Conditions were tough, especially on the Charles,” Perdomo said. “We had long periods of wait in hopes of the wind establishing itself. The shifty conditions made for some very tactical sailing.”
Second place Dartmouth and third place Brown were 16 and 17 points behind the Crimson at the competition’s conclusion.
REED TROPHY (NEW ENGLAND WOMEN’S CHAMPIONSHIP)
With the top 11 finishers in the event qualifying for the Women’s National Semifinal Championship, Harvard needed to do better than its 12th place finish last year to receive a berth.  The all women’s group of senior crew Sydney Karnovsky, sophomore skipper Taylor Ladd, sophomore crew Kirstin Anderson, sophomore crew Ariana Gross, and freshman skipper Taylor Gavula did just that by finishing ninth in the field of 18 inter-conference schools.
“New England is probably the most competitive district in the U.S. for women’s sailing, so we’re pretty psyched that we were able to do this well at the qualifiers,” Ladd said. “We’re hoping to improve on some things that we messed up this weekend and go make a good showing in San Diego.”
The A-Division crew of Ladd and Anderson posted 159 points on the weekend, never finishing higher than third or lower than sixteenth in any individual races. Gavula, Karnovsky, and Gross totaled 115 points over their sixteen events. The A and B- crews finished 13th and 7th in their respective divisions, helping the team post 274 total points on the weekend.
Conditions were quite variable throughout the weekend with gusts shifting direction and changing in intensity consistently, greater difficulty on all of the sailors.
“I think we sailed well and were really resilient throughout all of the different changes,” Ladd said. “We’re pretty proud of ourselves.”
Coast Guard Academy, Boston College, URI, BU, and Yale were the top-five finishers in the group with a spread of 86 points from top to bottom. The Crimson sat in eighth until the final two races on the weekend as Vermont pulled ahead with top three finishes in both.
ADMIRAL’S CUP
Held at King’s Point, N.Y. by the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, the regatta featured three divisions of FJs, Lasers, and Z420s.  With a field of 20 inter-conference schools racing at the event, Harvard barely finished in the top half with its tenth place, 336 point performance.
Nearly all of the competition was completed on Saturday when the conditions were more conducive for racing with northerly breezes of 8-12 knots and light rain throughout the day.  The weather did not cooperate on Sunday, however, as a lack of breeze allowed few races to be competed.
The C-Division boat of freshman skipper Andrew Puopolo led the way for the Crimson on the weekend with his fourth place performance.  The rookie accrued 73 points over his 11 races, finishing in the top-ten in nine of those events. The A and B-Division crews posted 143 and 120 points, respectively.
The Crimson barely bested fellow Ivy League competitor Penn, whose 337 points were just one shy of Harvard’s mark.  St. Mary’s College of Maryland finished victorious with 173 points, finishing in the top two of the first and second divisions.
MORRIS TROPHY
In the second Harvard event on the Charles River Basin on the weekend, the Crimson finished in seventh.  Competing in field of 18 inter-conference schools, the squad posted 143 points over 17 FJ races between the two divisions.
The conditions were relatively fair throughout the weekend with winds between four and eight knots from Saturday afternoon into Sunday after Saturday’s morning showers dissipated.
In the A-Division, fellow freshmen, skipper Nicholas Karnovsky and crew Alejandra Resendiz, put forth an eighth place, 80-point performance.  The B-Division crew of senior skipper Adam Brodheim and crew Pryiscilla Russo accumulated 63 points over their eight races, good enough for seventh in the division.
Boston College led the way with its 70-point showing, while Tufts, Brown, Coast Guard and MIT rounded out the top five performers.

Wrapping up the regular season, the Harvard women’s golf trip traveled a few hours south to the Stanwich Club in Greenwich, CT to compete in the Ivy League Championships. By the time the weekend was over, the Crimson was hoisting the championship trophy for the fifth consecutive year.
“It’s always nice to have one championship because then you know you can do it,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “But each year brings with it new personnel and obstacles. To be able to win multiple really shows the focus the team has and how they have never become complacent.”
The tournament featured one 18-hole round of play each day from Friday through Sunday. The 6,094 yard Stanwich Club played at par 73 for the weekend. The course features 10 holes where water is in play.
The Crimson opened play strong, combining for a team score of 302 on day one, eight strokes ahead of its nearest competitor. Despite being outshot by Princeton by a margin of two on Saturday, Harvard never lost the top spot on the leaderboard.
A round three 305 further extended the lead, cementing a Crimson finish at +43, 13 shots in front of the second-place Tigers. Yale finished the tournament in third, 29 strokes off the Crimson pace.
Harvard’s 302 and 305 were the two lowest round scores for any school in the tournament.
The Crimson was particularly dominant on par 5 holes, shooting +5 overall. That was 11 shots better than Columbia, who ranked second best in that category.
By virtue of winning, Harvard earned a trip to NCAA Regionals in May.
“In order to get over the hump and make Nationals we definitely need to keep sharpening the different aspect of our game,” Harvard captain Christine Lin said. “We’ve been close to advancing to Nationals in the past, hopefully we can accomplish that goal this year.”
On the individual side, junior Anne Cheng placed second at seven over par, just one shot behind Yale’s Jennifer Peng. Peng’s round one score of 72 was the only under par performance of any player on the course during the tournament.
Just two shots below Cheng was freshman teammate Michelle Xie, who took third.
Senior Christine Lin’s 232 was good enough for a tie for sixth place, matching Princeton’s Amber Wang. Despite coming down with food poisoning Friday night, freshman Anna Zhou was only one shot behind, ending play in eighth. Senior Courtney Hooton also competed for Harvard on the weekend.
Rounding out the top five on the individual leaderboard were Hana Ku of Princeton and Christine Kim of Brown. Both players finished in a tie for fourth at +12.
“I feel like every player on our team has the ability to help us out at any time,” Lin said. “We are all giving it our all on every hole, we don’t crack under pressure and to me that’s one of the strongest traits of this team.”
Columbia, Brown, Penn, and Dartmouth placed fifth through eighth at the event, respectively.
Harvard will be assigned to one of four regional tournaments. Those will be taking place in Stanford, Calif., Bryan, Texas, Baton Rouge, La., and Shoal Creek, Ala. on May 5-7.
“I’m very excited for this year’s team and our chances to go even further,” Rhoads said. “It’s not always an apples to apples comparison going against top-tier programs outside the Ivy League. But one area we can match up well for sure is our preparation; this is a very strong team.”
The Crimson will try to balance preparation for regionals with finals and the ending of the academic year.
“Obviously, it’s not ideal for us to have regionals scheduled in the middle of finals week,” Rhoads said. “Some of the other programs we’ll be up against have already had their terms end. That said, coming so close to Nationals the last few years shows we’re up for the challenge.”
