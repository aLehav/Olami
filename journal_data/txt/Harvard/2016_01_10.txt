After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Harvard men’s basketball team (6-8) prepares to kick off Ivy League play Saturday, the two most important names are the players not currently practicing. Starting freshman point guard freshman Tommy McCarthy and senior sixth man Patrick Steeves—the team’s top two distributors—remain game-time decisions for Saturday’s Ancient Eight opener against Dartmouth (4-8).
The potential absences of the duo have ripple effects down the lineup. Junior Corbin Miller, who leads the bench in minutes and points per game, will make his first start of the season if McCarthy cannot play. Beyond Miller, a nontraditional point guard who is more shooter (45.3 percent shooting from three) than playmaker (1.1 assists per game), the team will rely on sophomore Andre Chatfield to step up.
Harvard coach Tommy Amaker acknowledged Tuesday that the offense may have to change to accommodate Chatfield, who has primarily played on the wing so far this season.
“If Dre is there, we have to tweak and massage a few things to make him more comfortable,” Amaker said. “But with Corbin, he’s played the point for us and he’s comfortable [in our sets]. The issue is wearing him down, wearing him out, but we will deal with that when we get there.”
Both Miller and Amaker stressed that the team can ill afford a long adjustment period. In the Ivy League, the only league in the country to decide its champion by regular season record, dropping a single game can decide the playoff race.
“I think they are well aware of how important every game in our conference is,” Amaker said. “Certainly home games and games that are early are important because if you can get out of the blocks and separate earlier rather than later, you have a greater chance of finishing strong down the stretch.”
During its five-year championship run, the Crimson has taken advantage of the early opportunities. Harvard is 9-1 against Dartmouth, the team it plays twice before it takes on any other Ivy League squad, over the span. Three times it has won at least its first five games of the season, never going worse than 5-1 on the first six-game leg.
Amaker’s teams have been so successful, however, because of their ability to take care of business against lesser opponents. Over the five-year span, Harvard has a 37-3 record against teams that eventually finished in the bottom half of the standings, including an unblemished 20-0 home mark.
Much of that comes from Amaker’s single-minded focus on the next opponent and reluctance to look ahead. As the coach pointed out Tuesday, the team on the other side of the floor took out Harvard the Crimson in at Lavietes a year ago.
“Dartmouth is a game and a team and a program that is similar to what we just faced,” Amaker said. “We have always had our troubles, as everyone seems like they have in our league, with one team or another and maybe most of them. They have come here and knocked us off in the past.”
In the absence of two of its strongest playmakers, the team will look to its leading scorer, junior power forward/center Zena Edosomwan, to carry the load inside. Edosomwan, who has more than tripled his rebounding and scoring averages from last year, has scored in double figures in all but four games this year.
“I’m happy with [my play] so far,” Edosomwan said. “I want to continue making strides. I’m not content being a good player—I want to be great and that’s the next step for me.”
Amaker ceded that his team does not hide from the fact that it relies so much on the junior inside.
“There’s no mystery about it,” the coach said. “We are trying to get it to him as much as possible and we want to play through him, play around him, and play it from there, whether that’s the first minute of the game or the last minute of the game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Behind a career-high 29 points from senior Agunwa Okolie, the Harvard men’s basketball team opened Ivy League play with a win over the visiting Dartmouth Big Green. The Crimson (7-8, 1-0 Ivy league) shot 53 percent from the field, with Okolie making nine of his 11 shots and all 10 of his free throws.
Down the stretch, Okolie and senior Patrick Steeves took over for Harvard. The duo had the Crimson’s final 17 points, with Okolie scoring the final 10—including a three-pointer with 52 seconds remaining that pushed the lead to six. After Dartmouth freshman forward Evan Boudreaux answered with a triple on the other end, Okolie had four straight free throws to close out the Big Green (4-9, 0-1).
“It was a hell of a game,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “They were really excited in the locker room and they should have been. This is one of those moments where as a coach you’re proud of your kids.”
After talking all week about teaching the underclassmen how Ivy League basketball differed from non-conference play, the seniors went out and led by example Saturday. Okolie, Steeves—who set a career high himself with 20 points—and senior Evan Cummins combined for 59 points, 17 rebounds, and seven assists on the day. The trio assisted or scored all but five second half baskets.
With the team getting just six combined points from its starting freshman backcourt of Tommy McCarthy and Corey Johnson—who both posted season lows in points—the seniors stepped up to take on the offensive load. As a group, the Class of 2016 took 62 percent of the team’s shots, more than twice their season average, making 21 of 33 attempts from the field.
“I thought [Okolie’s] play as a senior was tremendous,” Amaker said. “I thought Pat Steeves as a senior was outstanding. I thought Evan Cummins playing as a senior, for Evan to kind of quarterback our team from the back line of our defense and a big block he had late. Those three guys really, really stepped forward as veteran guys.”
For most of the game, however, the Crimson struggled to create distance between themselves and the visitors. Dartmouth had little problem generating quality shots all afternoon, with Boudreaux and sophomore Miles Wright combining for 44 points on just 29 shots. In the first half, Wright had 15 in the first 16 minutes as the Big Green ran out to a 32-23 lead.
It was Harvard’s seniors that responded. On the next possession, Okolie drove the lane and slipped by Wright for a three-point play. Two possessions later, Steeves beat his man off the dribble for a layup. Given more space a minute later, he drilled a three—his third of the half—to cut the lead to five.
After another Okolie layup and a Dartmouth shot clock violation, the Crimson set up a play for Steeves at the top of the key with five seconds to go. With two Big Green defenders on him, the senior wheeled and fired a pass to Johnson. Five feet behind the arc, the freshman never hesitated—drilling a three to tie the game heading into the break.
“The way we ended the first half on a little bit of a momentum play … we thought if we got out of the blocks we could created some separation,” Amaker said.
Out of the break, Harvard did just that, dominating the first four minutes—extending its lead to seven with 16:14 to go on another Steeves three. However, Dartmouth came right back with a Wright three, scoring six straight to cut the lead to one.
The ensuing 12 minutes featured two lead changes and five ties as neither team was able to push a lead beyond three. Despite struggling to get leading scorer junior Zena Edosomwan (eight points, eight rebounds) going offensively, the Crimson overcame stretches of turnovers by holding the Big Green to just 34 percent shooting in the second period.
Afterwards, Amaker noted the importance of legacy for his seniors, who have the opportunity to become the second Harvard graduating class ever to win four Ivy League championships.
“We’ve touched on different things as seniors and how wonderful your senior year can be and how meaningful that is,” Amaker said. “Having been a senior myself and played, I make sure that they know how you’re going to remember it for the rest of your life.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard picked up its first win of 2016 and moved to 1-0 in Ivy League play with a 77-70 win over Dartmouth (4-9, 0-1 Ivy League) on Saturday at Lavietes Pavilion. In a back-and-forth game that featured 13 ties and four lead changes, The Crimson (7-8, 1-0) rode an undersized lineup and converted its free throws down the stretch to come away with the win at home.
SENIOR LEADERSHIP
The Class of 2016 was huge for Harvard on Saturday. Senior forward Patrick Steeves was a game-time decision for Saturday’s contest but the Montreal native showed no ill effects from the injury that kept him out of last week’s game against Vermont. Classmate Agunwa Okolie, the team’s top perimeter defender, was the catalyst for Harvard on both ends of the floor. With junior power forward/center Zena Edosomwan facing double teams, fourth-year Evan Cummins picked up the scoring slack down low.
“It was a terrific performance out of some guys that have really stepped up as seniors for us,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I was really happy for our guys.”
All told, the trio of upperclassmen combined for 59 points, 17 rebounds, and seven assists to will the Crimson to a scratch-and-claw victory over the Big Green. Okolie posted a career-best 29 points while the 20 points and four three-pointers were both highs for Steeves. Entering the contest, the trio had combined for an average of 23.6 points per game.
After Dartmouth cut the Harvard lead to one with 7:19 to play, the senior trio scored the last 19 points of the game for the Crimson. The biggest of those points came on a corner three from Okolie with 52 seconds to go after the Big Green had cut the lead to three on the previous possession. The Okolie trey, just his sixth attempt of the season, put the game out of reach.
“Huge play, huge shot as we know,” Amaker said. “[It] kind of gave us that cushion as we were able to close it out.”
With their team shooting just 60 percent from the charity stripe entering the game, Okolie and Steeves knocked down their final six free throw attempts to seal the win.
FINISHING STRONG
Harvard’s victory was spearheaded by strong runs to end each of the half. Dartmouth had control for most of the opening period and took a nine-point lead with 4:05 to play in the first half. However, after a Steeves three cut the lead to five, Amaker took a timeout that would ultimately prove to be a turning point. Three defensive stops, two three-pointers, and a layup later, the Crimson entered the locker room with a share of the lead.
Sixteen minutes of game action later, Harvard came out of the game’s final media timeout holding just a one-point lead. Once again, the Crimson used the final four minutes for a key run. This time around, Harvard scored 14 of the game’s final 22 points, six coming on free throws.
“Give credit to [Dartmouth],” Amaker said. “They came back and fought and made this a nail-biter and then we were able to separate right there at the end.”
Down the stretch, Harvard utilized a smaller lineup. Edosomwan struggled to score for much of the game, constantly battling double teams and foul trouble. Amaker countered with his core group of three seniors surrounded by junior Corbin Miller and either freshman Corey Johnson or sophomore Andre Chatfield. The lineup worked against a Big Green team that did not have a player over 6’8”.
“Never easy in the Ivy League, always a dogfight,” Amaker said. “I was really pleased for our kids and seeing different players that really had to step forward for us to come up with that kind of win in that environment.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK—Another year, another beating delivered to the Harvard men’s hockey team at the World’s Most Famous Arena. This time, however, the drubbing lasted only a period.
Three Quinnipiac goals over a span of 36 seconds in the opening frame left the No. 5/4 Crimson’s defense in shambles Saturday night, and a fourth tally at 12:43 gave the No. 2/1 Bobcats a commanding 4-0 edge heading into the first intermission. Yet with most of the 12,016 in attendance anticipating yet another rout at the Rivalry On Ice, Harvard retaliated, storming back to score four consecutive goals and force an extra frame.
But 2:55 into overtime, Quinnipiac (19-1-3, 10-0-2 ECAC) bookended its perfect start with a perfect finish. Skating onto a loose puck by the left circle, junior defenseman Derek Smith blasted a shot past freshman netminder Michael Lackey, powering the ECAC frontrunners to a 5-4 overtime victory at Madison Square Garden.
Smith’s slapper squashed the Crimson’s comeback bid after Harvard (8-3-3, 4-2-3) had finally finished climbing the four-goal mountain just over 10 minutes into the third period.
With his side down 4-3, freshman forward Ryan Donato delivered a feed from the left boards to an open Colin Blackwell in the middle of the slot. But the fifth-year senior wrung the left iron on his shot, keeping the Crimson on the comeback trail.
But before Blackwell’s shift came to an end, the senior received a second opportunity. After moving to the right circle, Blackwell regained possession of the puck and picked the top right corner with a rocket of a wrister to silence the predominantly Bobcat crowd.
“Down 4-0 [we knew] that we could go two different ways,” Blackwell said. “Either we can pack it in and call it a night, or four goals—chip away one at a time. And guys bought in, kind of realized those first 10-15 minutes were probably our worst of the season and [that] there’s still 40 minutes left to play.”
First it was junior center Alex Kerfoot, who received a feed from co-captain Jimmy Vesey atop the slot at 7:11 in the second period and picked the same corner on senior goaltender Michael Garteig, who entered the game with a 1.29 goals against average.
Then it was junior forward Tyler Moy, maneuvering all the way from the New York Rangers logo at center ice to the goalmouth, where he forced the netminder to bite on a backhand and swiftly moved to his right, diving to beat Garteig and light the lamp on the power play at 10:53.
And finally it was Donato, who fell down after fanning on an opportunity in the slot, but managed to corral the loose puck and force it past the ECAC’s top goaltender while lying on the ice at 17:43. The rookie later fed Blackwell in the third period to erase the deficit altogether.
Nonetheless, the opening frame proved to be Harvard’s downfall. Coming off a third period in which the Crimson surrendered four goals—three in a span of 129 seconds—to Boston University on Thursday, Harvard’s defensive struggles continued right out of the gate. However, Thursday night, the wheels only fell off. Saturday night, the wheels were nowhere to be found.
Breaking out on a 2-on-1 along the left wing with Bobcat captain Soren Jonzzon, defenseman Alex Miner-Barron opened the floodgates at 7:29, electing to hold the puck and fire away, beating Lackey high glove-side.
Playing in his first game since Nov. 13—a 4-1 loss at Quinnipiac—Lackey then watched the game slip away from him in the blink of an eye. Twenty seconds following the Bobcats’ first goal, Lackey fell to his back making a save against Tommy Schutt, allowing junior forward K.J. Tiefenwerth to tap in his side’s second goal of the night.
Then 13 seconds later, junior forward Sam Anas danced past defenseman Victor Newell by the right circle and slipped a shot through Lackey’s pads to up the lead to three. Senior center Travis St. Denis picked up an assist on the play and later put home Quinnipiac’s fourth of the period off a feed from Anas at 12:43.
Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 took a timeout after the second Bobcat goal in an attempt to stop the bleeding, but Quinnipiac continued to force the Crimson into mistakes. Donato considered giving the rookie the hook in favor of sophomore Merrick Madsen, who had been unbeaten through nine games before allowing six goals to the Terriers on Thursday. But with his entire squad struggling alongside his netminder, Donato elected not to pull his starter.
“It was something we thought about after the first period,” Donato said. “I didn’t want to single [Lackey] out in a period where quite frankly, we didn’t show up in the first 10 minutes off the game.”
“I thought he battled back,” he added. “I thought he made some excellent saves to keep the game where it was to give us a chance to come back.”
Following the fourth Quinnipiac score, Lackey made 21 consecutive saves to keep the Bobcats off the scoreboard as Harvard climbed back.
“You’d think a goaltender would be rattled giving up three goals in 30 seconds, and they left him in there,” Smith said. “We were kind of surprised. Then we didn’t get a lot of traffic or shots in the second period, and that kind of gave him some confidence for the rest of the game.”
Lackey’s save streak came to an abrupt halt, however, when Smith lit the lamp midway through the overtime period to make the Crimson pay for its early defensive woes.
"Hopefully we'll see them again," Blackwell said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s swimming and diving squad put forth four top-10 finishes on Thursday and Friday at the Wally Nakamoto Hawaii Diving Invitational in Honolulu. Competing against the likes of Columbia, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and Hawaii in an event hosted by the Rainbow Warriors, freshman Luke Martinez and sophomore David Pfeifer led the way on the diving side for the Crimson in the one-meter and three-meter springboard events.
Both springboard events featured the same top-three finishers, with Hawaii senior Amund Gismervik and freshman Johan Sandell placing first and second in each contest, respectively, while Columbia sophomore Jayden Pantel took home both bronze medals.
In the one-meter springboard, Gismervik’s mark of 349.00 paced the field. Martinez posted the top mark in the event for Harvard for the second consecutive meet with his eighth place, 262.65-point showing, while Pfeifer and fellow sophomore Bobby Ross were both within 15 points of the freshman en route to their respective ninth and 11th place finishes. Rounding out the lineup for Harvard, junior Manasseh Oso placed 15th in the contest.
Looking to build on his fourth place result in the three-meter springboard at the UGA Invitational in December, Pfeifer continued to roll in the event. The Merrimack, N.H. native also placed fourth on Friday with a mark of 354.90 and finished just shy of fellow Ivy League competitor Pantel’s score of 359.05. Ross was again not far behind his classmate, as his 304.20-point performance was good enough for sixth.  Oso and Martinez finished 12th and 14th, respectively, in the 14-man field.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s and women’s track and field squads kicked off their seasons on Friday with a combined nine event wins at the Southern Tier Collegiate Invite in Ithaca, N.Y. Solid performances from consistent contributors and recent newcomers alike showcased the team’s depth across the board.
Co-captain Autumne Franklin and senior Kieran Gallagher claimed first place in the 60-meter hurdle and 1000-meter run, respectively.  In the high jump, junior Raegan Nizdil also came home with the gold with a height of 1.73 meters, a leap just off her career high of 1.75. Fellow junior Brandon Price put forth a 4:16.69 in the mile to claim first as well.
In her first time running the event, senior Christi Scott ran to a 57.16 gold medal finish in the 400-meter dash. However, this was not the only career first for a member of the Crimson squad on the day. In the 3000-meter run, senior Emma Payne, a former walk-on, claimed the first victory of her college career with a personal best of 10:05.36.
“Her patience and grit is so inspirational,” Gallagher said. “She came in as a walk-on and now she's one of our top scorers in the distance events.”
But the upperclassmen were not the only ones to have success in Ithaca. Harvard’s overall depth was on display throughout the day as both squads’ newcomers were eager to put a stamp on their young careers. The freshman competitors posted seven podium finishes in individual contests.
“For some of them, it’s their second meet for Harvard,” men’s co-captain James Lim said.  “For a lot of them this is their first meet ever with Harvard Track and Field. I think this just showed us exactly how much depth that we have in our freshman class.”
On the men’s side, pole vaulter Ian West claimed bronze with his 4.65-meter vault, while fellow rookie runners Liam Hackett and Myles Marshall both placed second in the 1000-meter and 500-meter events, respectively. Hackett’s time of 2:36.76 fell just behind sophomore Jonas Aranda’s 2:32.82 career best, pace-setting mark.  Marshall, on the other hand, looks to build off of the strong performance as he expands his workload in the future.
“[Marshall] ran the 500 and ran a pretty good time,” Lim said. “We definitely think he can contribute across a lot more events so he’ll run different events in the coming weeks and we’ll see where he’s at, but he had a solid season opener.”
Freshman Gabby Thomas showed her prowess in the sprints by claiming gold in both the women’s 60-meter dash and 200-meter dash.  The Florence, Mass. native’s time of 7.54 helped her best fellow rookie sprinter Ngozi Musa’s third place mark of 7.67 in the 60-meter event.
Even more impressive was Thomas’ victory in the 200 as she was, by posting her 24.68 mark, able to outrun Franklin, consistently a top Ivy League finisher in the event, by a half second. Malia Ellington was the final freshman medalist for the Crimson with her second place result of 5:00.24 in the mile run.
“It's exciting to have such a strong freshman class,” Gallagher said. “We graduated some key scorers last year but the freshman are really stepping up, which will hopefully make a big difference at Heps.”
Since Cornell is also the host for the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships in February, the meet provided Harvard with a great chance to prepare for the road that lies ahead.
“The main point of the meet was to get a feel for what it’s like to travel to Cornell, and compete there,” Lim said. “I think that overall the meet went very solidly. The team brought the energy, the effort and executed their own things that they had to do at a very high level.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK—The No. 5/4 Harvard men’s hockey team’s defensive breakdown came late in its Thursday night game against No. 11/11 Boston University, as the squad surrendered three goals in the final four minutes to see its two-goal lead slip away.
On Saturday night under the bright lights at Madison Square Garden, it came quick and it came fast.
Four goals from No. 2/1 Quinnipiac in the first 13 minutes of play provided just enough cushion for the Bobcats to withstand Harvard’s four-goal flurry over the remainder of regulation. Quinnipiac’s Derek Smith put home a game-winner with 2:05 left in overtime, as the Crimson fell, 5-4.
“I think guys bought in and realized those first 15 minutes were the worst of our season and that there were still 40 minutes left to play,” fifth-year senior Colin Blackwell said. “So we just had to keep believing in each other and chipping away…[but] we lost the game.”
THERE ARE NO MORAL VICTORIES
Previous versions of the Harvard squad might have found comfort in the team’s four-goal comeback to force overtime against the best team in the country per the PairWise rankings in Quinnipiac (19-1-3, 10-0-2 ECAC). But for a team that took the Whitelaw Cup last March and returned most of its starters, playing a team close is no large accomplishment.
“There are certainly no moral victories,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ‘91 said. “We’re too good of a team for us to want to hear that. But I do think they showed a lot of guts in battling back.”
Harvard (8-3-3, 4-2-3) will likely fall in the national rankings with losses to BU and the Bobcats, but the Crimson is still primed to make a run for a national championship at the NCAA tournament—a single elimination tournament.
“There are no series in college hockey,” Donato said. “You have one game.”
QUESTIONS AT GOALIE
Donato decided to shake things up in net for the Rivalry on Ice, replacing sophomore Merrick Madsen with freshman Michael Lackey after the former let in six goals in the Crimson loss against BU. The change did not have the desired effect, however.
Lackey let in four goals on the first 12 shots he faced, two of which came on 2-on-1 opportunities that the rookie was unable to squash. The first Quinnipiac tally came off the stick of Alex Miner-Barron, who beat Lackey blocker-side from the slot after deciding not to pass on the odd-man rush. K.J. Tiefenwerth followed up 23 seconds later on an easy rebound chance created by Tommy Schutt on a shot that handcuffed Lackey and sent him sprawling on his back.
“I thought about [switching goalies],” Donato said. “I didn’t want to single him out in a period where quite frankly we didn’t show up in the first 10 minutes of the game. I thought he battled back and made some excellent saves...to give us a chance to come back.”
Despite the four-goal deluge in the opening minutes of the game, Donato decided to stick with Lackey for the remainder of the game. But the question remains whether some combination of Madsen and Lackey can provide enough support beneath the pipes to help bring the conference’s leading offense back to its second straight ECAC conference final. While Madsen has the league’s second highest save percentage at .940, late game lapses like his at BU may be too much for the attack to overcome on a regular basis.
HOME ON THE ROAD
In order to keep its annual tradition of playing in New York City going, Harvard decided to concede the home game in its two-game slate with Quinnipiac in conference play. MSG felt like anything but home for the Crimson, however. The seats in the fabled New York arena were occupied predominantly with Bobcat supporters, a sea of yellow filling the navy seats of the Garden.
The Crimson’s status as home team came even though Harvard had to travel more than double the distance to come down to play, with the Bobcats being within a 100-mile radius of MSG.
Despite the disadvantages of the event, playing at Madison Square Garden provides benefits for the players that are tough to find at any other venue.
“It’s a tremendous place to play,” Donato said. “If you're a college hockey player and you get to play in this environment...as far as development and life experience, it’s a great atmosphere.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The No. 9/9 Harvard women’s ice hockey team started off 2016 strong this weekend with two wins on home ice.
The Crimson was coming off of a low note at the end of 2015, having closed out the first half of its season with overtime losses to Quinnipiac and Princeton. Harvard was able to set a new tone for 2016 in this weekend’s matchups.
HARVARD 6, COLGATE 2
Facing off against No. 10/- Colgate (11-4-6, 3-2-4 ECAC) on Saturday afternoon for the first of two meetings slated this season, the Crimson (10-4-1, 7-3-1) had its offense running on all cylinders.
“I think that we were relentless today,” sophomore defenseman Chelsea Ziadie said. “It didn’t matter if we had one goal or five goals, we were still going after the puck no matter what and I think that’s something that really helped us today offensively.”
This was the first time in the past 29 meetings between the two teams that both sides came into the face off as ranked.
Harvard went down early in the first period when Raider forward Megan Sullivan snuck the puck past senior goalie Emerance Maschmeyer 72 seconds into the game. The lead stood strong for the majority of the period until senior forward Miye D’Oench tied the game with the help of Ziadie and sophomore forward Lexie Laing. D’Oench took the shot from the top of the ice and the puck found the back of the net off of a deflection.
The Crimson dominated the offensive boards in the second period, taking the lead with goals from freshmen defensemen Kate Hallett and Kaitlin Tse. This was Tse’s first goal of the semester and the second for Hallett.
“It’s always great when you have contributors from all four grades and from all the lines and everyone came out tonight,” D’Oench said. “You’re a much stronger team when you have that. You can’t only depend on your veterans and I think tonight was a huge confidence booster for the younger kids.”
The scoring kept coming for Harvard late into the third period. Junior forward Sydney Daniels and sophomore forward Karly Heffernan each tacked a goal onto the scoreboard, with assists coming from D’Oench, Laing, and freshman forward Grace Zarzecki.
Colgate was able to score on Maschmeyer late in the period, but the Crimson retaliated less than 30 seconds later with a goal of its own from D’Oench to wrap up the scoring for the evening. Through 15 games, D’Oench leads the team in goals and assists with 10 and 11, respectively.
HARVARD 2, CORNELL 0
After more than a month off the ice, the team faced off against Ivy League opponent Cornell (7-7-2, 3-4-2 Ivy) Friday night for a 2-0 win.
“It’s always tough coming back from winter break and not having played together after awhile, but we had a very hard week of practice to get back into game shape and I think that reflected really well this weekend,” D’Oench said.
The Crimson was able to capitalize off of a Big Red checking penalty early in the first period, as Zarzecki scored on a power play at the 17:53 mark of the opening frame. Zarzecki fielded a pass to the short side of the goal, trickling the puck past the defender. Thus far this season Zarzecki has seen time in all 15 of Harvard’s games, racking up six goals and three assists in her rookie campaign. Friday’s goal was her second power play tally of the season.
Contrasting first year experience with veteran ice time, Maschmeyer was a force in net, recording her fourth shut out of the season against Cornell, upping her save percentage to .958.  During the course of the game, Maschmeyer held up the Big Red’s 23 shots on goal, moving her within 21 shots of taking the Crimson’s all time career save record.
“Emerance played really well and I think one of our team goals we are working [toward improving] is scoring and I think we were able to work on that during this game while we were able to do very well defensively as well,” Ziadie said.
Harvard’s second scoring effort came from Laing. With a minute and five seconds left in the contest, Laing got help from Daniels and D’Oench to hurdle the puck past Cornell goalie Marlen Boissonnault.
This was the Crimson’s first shut out since its Nov. 24 match up against Northeastern.
“The shut out was a testament to our whole team defense,” senior captain Michelle Picard said. “It was good to see our team come together and put out a full team effort.”
