Move over Travis Scott Burger, there’s a new collaboration in town. Who better to become the next face of a global, viral campaign than the insanely popular and talented K-pop powerhouse — BTS? The official McDonald’s Twitter announced on April 19 that the “BTS Meal” will be the latest creation of McDonald’s Famous Orders program, whose past partnerships have included artists Travis Scott and J Balvin. This one-of-a-kind meal will feature the seven members’ favorite orders, including classics like the 10 piece Chicken McNuggets, medium fries, and a medium drink, but also two new dipping sauces inspired by McDonald’s South Korea recipes — Sweet Chili and Cajun. The “BTS Meal” will go on sale starting May 26 in the United States and will then become the first Famous Order in McDonald’s history to go on a global “tour,” spanning nearly 50 countries and six continents.
The unexpected collaboration between BTS and McDonald’s may come as a surprise for those who first discovered it through the trending of seemingly unrelated terms like “BTS,” “McDonald’s,” and “Sweet Chili and Cajun” on Twitter. However, the new “BTS Meal” is actually a brilliant marketing campaign based on precedent and careful analysis of the global market.
For starters, this is not the first time that McDonald’s has collaborated with celebrities. The first instance where a celebrity’s name has been featured on the McDonald’s menu was with Michael Jordan in 1992. Then, just last September, McDonald’s announced the creation of the Famous Orders program to introduce some of its classic menu items to a new generation of consumers, starting with a collaboration with rapper Travis Scott.
What followed was a wildly successful marketing campaign that made the Travis Scott Burger, a Quarter Pounder burger with cheese, bacon, and shredded lettuce, go viral all across the United States. It became so much of a pop culture phenomenon that there was a shortage of Quarter Pounder ingredients at McDonald’s locations. The following meal collaboration with singer J Balvin also gained widespread attention.
For BTS, endorsing and collaborating with various brands is not a new phenomenon. To list just a few, BTS is the face of local Korean companies like Bodyfriend and Chilsung, as well as global brands like Samsung and Baskin-Robbins. McDonald’s is just another addition to their extensive list of branding power. In Korea, it is common — and almost desired, by both the public and companies — for celebrities, including K-pop stars like BTS, to be the face of endorsements and collaborations. One only needs to walk down the streets of Seoul to be surrounded by advertisements featuring Korean celebrities promoting all different products from fried chicken to makeup brands to mattresses.
This strategic deal with BTS is a chance for McDonald’s to replicate, if not surpass, the viral sensation of the Travis Scott Burger, but now on the global stage. Part of BTS’s immense success stems from the incredible online presence, organization, and dedication of ARMY (the official name for BTS fans) who span all across the world. It’s nothing new for BTS albums and concerts to be sold out in mere minutes or for BTS to constantly trend on all social media platforms. It has long been known that anything BTS touches will immediately sell out, even items they do not intentionally promote; a fabric softener sold out for two months after Jungkook mentioned once that he used it.
Already, many ARMYs are expressing excitement and even making fanart on Twitter after the announcement, promising to buy as many BTS Meals as possible in support of their favorite K-pop superstars. This strategic move by BTS and McDonald’s is tapping into the global stardom and power of BTS. One can only imagine how quickly ARMY could help sell out the “BTS Meal” and make it the next global sensation in mere minutes. Only time will tell.

Twenty years after the beloved comedy masterpiece “Shrek” premiered in theatres, it is still making waves as one of the most unique and groundbreaking animated movies to date. With Mike Myers at the helm as the titular protagonist, there’s no wonder that the film managed to make such a splash. Still immensely popular two decades after its release, “Shrek” — and its three sequels — remains as resonant as ever because of its knockout casting and phenomenal direction. Who wouldn’t love watching an ogre and a donkey discover their friendship while working to save their swamp?
As a landmark piece of 21st century comedy, “Shrek” expanded the boundaries of what a family movie could be by adding witty double-entendres and often blatantly adult jokes. With the backing of Dreamworks Animation, writers Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Joe Stillman, and Roger S.H. Schulman took advantage of the phenomenal casting and powerhouse directing to make one of the most well-known animated films of all time.
Throughout the entirety of the film, the incredible cast is able to work in tandem to create a truly enthralling and captivating experience for the audience. With the top billed cast including the names Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy, John Lithgow, and Vincent Cassel, there is no wonder that under the careful direction — even in their directorial debut — of Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, the intimate and sympathetic relationships that are built on screen elicit a visceral response from the audience.
The love between Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and Shrek (Mike Myers) is a masterclass in how to healthily portray love and affection on screen. The entirety of their romantic subplot explores what it means to truly find the best in a person — looking beyond external appearances, even in the case of a green ogre. This couple, even with the potential to be a normal human couple in “Shrek 2,” want to be their authentic selves. This positive modeling — paired with incredible humor delivered by phenomenal actors and comedians — has shown kids what good, genuine kindness can look like in a relationship.
Even Donkey (Eddie Murphy) in his seemingly infinite ignorance manages to embody true friendship. Donkey stays by Shrek even when he stubbornly tries to keep everyone at a distance from himself. Donkey pushes him to take that step and branch out, urging him to be vulnerable and open himself up to new relationships.
In so many ways, “Shrek” is a film based on building and maintaining relationships. At the same time, it remains a witty, lighthearted comedy, effectively balancing the humorous and the emotional. It has its fun teases to please adults — think of the welcome to Duloc informational animatronic and all of the film’s satirical elements — while still appealing to children with its immersive fairytale world. The pure joy one feels at any age watching “Shrek” speaks volumes to what the movie represents: a universal connection to relatable, comedic storytelling.
As its 20th birthday comes and goes, “Shrek” will continue to be one of the most well-known and beloved films of the 2000s. As a comedy animation movie, the cast and crew managed to win an Oscar for Best Animated Feature. With three direct sequels starring the angry green ogre and his friends and family and one spinoff, a truly remarkable franchise emerged around a remarkable, lovable unique character. In any day and age, “Shrek” is the perfect movie to throw on the television — streamed, on DVD, or even VHS — for almost any situation.

Creating art collaboratively is more difficult now than ever before. Despite the obstacles, the Harvard Dance Project launched its digital archive on April 15 consisting of month-long access to debuting performances, this time in a virtual format instead of a live premiere.
The project was co-created by Mary Galstian ’22, Camryn D. Jones ’22, Anne J. Lheem ’21, Grace T. Western ’21, and Lauren Xu ’24 and facilitated by professor Laura B. Rodriguez (LROD) and Daniel P. Rivera ‘20. It is the culmination of a semester of design, research, and filming, all reimagined for a virtual landscape.
With the HDP, Professor LROD seeks to show that dance is more than just moving around. “It is movement, and it is embodied, but it is from sources and research, and it's grounded in that, so it comes from a place that's a little bit different than just moving from technique or thinking just only about line and form,” she said. At this level of research and art, there is a significant problem with underrepresentation of women and minorities. “And when we think of the visibility of women choreographers, there are not many,” Professor LROD said.
Galstian emphasizes that HDP is a unique opportunity to share her personal perspective and feelings. “For my project personally, it's about the Armenian genocide, and also the connection with the recent war that happened in the Artsakh region that around the world is known as Nagorno-Karabakh,” she said.
HDP’s ambitious and varied goals, including “decolonial performance and dance studies, race and gender studies, identity politics, artivism, and social justice,” point to the ambition and variety of the co-creators and their work. “I think that you can see, as the archive grows and continues on through this month, that students have taken different approaches to that work,” Rivera said.
For Jones, the HDP and the resources it provided were more than just a chance to explore her interest in the intersection of dance and mathematics — it provided her an opportunity to create a matrices-based program that would help others express themselves. Her program randomly generates numbers that can be assigned to dance steps and used to create choreography. “I wanted to create a space for people who are less creative or have less of a creative mindset, allow them to enter the space and use their own skill set and their strong suit to still be able to create something that is, in my opinion, very creative,” she said.
She hopes her project will serve as an inspiration for dancers, especially young Black women. “I think it's really important to showcase who I am and give them inspiration for the future and encourage them to also participate in this field, because we're definitely moving in a direction of lots more inclusivity and equity than in the past, and I think that's fantastic,” Jones said.
Xu’s project shares the same key word — exploration — and the same individuality, focusing on a Yin and Yang-inspired internal fight. “I ended up combining martial arts with ballet with a little bit of contemporary and also a little bit of K-Pop and Mandopop influences.”
But her performance is more than a deep dive into identity and culture. It’s a reflection of Xu’s own goals and inspirations. While not explicitly a response to the recently-aggravated racism against members of the Asian American community, it was nevertheless influenced by current events.
“Everything you take in, everything I've been consuming in terms of art and also what's going on in the world, right now also sort of indirectly seeps its way into the dance,” Xu said. “A lot has impacted me and sort of like bringing that story into the picture, so that maybe people can see it, and maybe people can resonate with it, or maybe it can motivate people,” she said.
Dance might not be the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about research and tackling societal issues, but the Harvard Dance Project does just that — providing a platform to often-unheard, underrepresented voices and contributing important work to the world of art.

A great film score can stand alone outside of its movie, but a film without its score is only a shell of what it could be. For this reason, some of the greatest original scores can come from subpar movies — like the brilliant score composed by Ennio Moriccione for John Boorman’s critically panned sequel to “The Exorcist.” Music can make or break the cinematic experience, and those composers who’ve mastered art of elevating a film are underappreciated and deserve celebration.
Based on their brilliant execution of storytelling, mood setting, and emotion through music, here are the best film scores of the last 20 years.
“Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon”: Tan Dun, 2000
Tan Dun and Yo-Yo Ma canonized East Asian music in this stunning soundtrack for Ang Lee’s 2000 movie, “Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.” The erhu percussion and supporting operatic vocalizations offer a fresh and entrancing effect that harmonize perfectly with the tender detache of Yo-Yo Ma’s romantic cello solos. Dun’s swelling composition is not only a great work of music, but narrates the collision between East and West by marrying traditions from Chinese opera, Asian theater, and ancient ritual to supplement this film.
“The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring”: Howard Shore, 2001
Howard Shore’s score for director Peter Jackson's “Lord of the Rings'' is nothing short of grand. The clashes of cymbals are very loud and in your face at the climax of "Bridge of Khazad Dum," while the flute rings quiet and introspective at the denouements in Enya’s "May It Be.” The imaginative mood that comes from that storytelling plays as much of a role in setting the scene as do the pictures on the screen.
“Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone”: John Williams, 2001 
Of course, only the most prolific composer of our time could possess the magic required to pull this score off. Like the popularity of the world-building theme in his earlier work “Star Wars,” the overarching theme in this soundtrack has become universally synonymous with J. K. Rowling’s wizarding world. Variations on “Hedwig’s Theme” are prevalent throughout some of the most defining moments of the entire series from start to finish. In true Williams fashion, the leitmotif effectively joins the score into a cohesive — and unforgettable — musical universe.
“The Hours”: Philip Glass, 2002
Philip Glass is at the forefront of contemporary composition, and his unique style is perhaps best encapsulated by the ingenuity that went into the soundtrack of Stephen Daldry’s “The Hours.” Just like the pacing of the movie waxes and wanes, the piano solo ebbs with the mercurial metronome set by composers Michael Riesman and Nico Muhly. The persistent and ceaseless melody replaying throughout this score in different variations, keys, and tempos glues the complex facets of each scene into one bigger picture. The overall effect that results from that parallelism is truly an emotional, intricate, and timeless work from Glass.
“Anna Karenina”: Dario Marianelli, 2012
Although he was overshadowed by Mychael Danna’s “Life of Pi” for Best Original Score at the 85th Academy Awards, Dario Marianelli’s “Anna Karenina” deserved to win the ‘score that outperformed the movie’ Oscar. Although director Joe Wright’s depiction of the romance between Karenina and Vronsky was subpar at best, the score went above and beyond to encapsulate the scandalous illicitness and irrevocable passion of such an affair. The accompanying accordion to whistling Russian folk songs fits the historical setting while the swelling of the violin crescendos with the sound mixed train hoots that foreshadow the imminent death of the heroine.
“The Grand Budapest Hotel”: Alexandre Desplat, 2014
Alexandre Desplat’s earlier work for the film “Fantastic Mr. Fox” was a precursor to the eccentric yet captivating style we see him fully develop in this score. Wes Anderson’s film is an immersive cultural experience that is filled with comedic idiosyncrasies and fascist undertones. Similarly, Desplat’s Russian folk-influenced symphonic compositions highlight the distinct drone of the balalaika and give the soundtrack its eastern European feel. The use of strings for cacophony and discordant tones of the lute in “Concerto for Lute and Plucked Strings I. Moderato,” are a perfect example of the role of music in setting the mood for this quirky movie.
“The Exception”: Ilan Eshkeri, 2016
The only non-Oscar nominated movie that is mentioned in this list comes for director David Levreaux’s “The Exception,” with its original film score composed by Ilan Eshkeri. The passionate wartime romance between a Nazi and a Dutch maid is intensified by Eshkeri’s neoclassical writing for violin, cello, and piano with orchestra parts. What makes it particularly noteworthy is the symbolism between the daunting and dreadful tension of death and war that is entrenched in the deep treble of the bass lines, as well as the discordant yet paradoxically harmonious falsetto trills of the higher strings that represent a blooming — yet entirely taboo — romance.
“Black Panther”: Ludwig Göransson, 2018
The fictional Wakandan world of Ryan Coogler’s “Black Panther” comes to life in Ludwig Göransson’s score. Although Göransson had worked with Coogler prior to this film, the artistic diversity of this score distinguishes it from his earlier work on “Fruitvale Station and “Creed.” This fictional utopian world had an equally imaginative sound rooted in choral singing, talking drums, and other traditional African elements untainted by the imperialism of Christianity.
“Joker”: Hildur Guðnadóttir, 2019
The best — and the only — female composer in this list is Hildur Guðnadóttir. The director, Todd Phillips, tasked Guðnadóttir with writing some music based on her feelings on the “Joker” screenplay, which resulted in a score filled with the swings of her subjective interpretation. There is nothing traditional about a creative process so dependent on the composer’s portrayal of the protagonist's emotions. Every turn in the music is a twist in a new direction, complex and completely unpredictable just like the action packed movie — and the title character himself. That dedication to building character development brings this score to life.

“Haunted: Latin America” follows in the footsteps of its North American counterpart “Haunted" in depicting real people sharing their true stories of haunted houses, possession, and other paranormal activities. The series’ high production value makes it a worthwhile stream for any horror or paranormal junkie, but the show is not without its shortcomings. While the first edition — as well as the first episode of the second — of the series was filled with stunning dramatizations, heart-tugging moments, and edge-of-your-seat horror, the show’s later episodes fail to live up to the expectations set by previous installments.
The series may disappoint some viewers from the start, because while it could have taken advantage of the many culturally specific Latin American horror stories, “Haunted: Latin America” instead merely retells horror stories in Spanish that could have been set anywhere but Latin America. Additionally, the series’ five episodes fail to live up to the show’s name, as it only covers two countries — Mexico and Colombia — out of the many found in Latin America.
“Haunted: Latin America” follows a similar narration style to that of the original series, where witnesses recount first-hand stories in a room surrounded by friends and family. The show most effectively uses this style to complement a story’s believability in the season’s first and arguably strongest episode, “The House of the Damned,” in which a mother recounts the story of a sinister presence in a house she had just moved into with her sons. This episode showcases the best of what the series has to offer, from both a narrative and production point of view. In the shots of the real-life testimony, audiences see the authentic emotion coming from the mother and her family, evoking the same feelings among its viewers. The reenactments are stylized with dark and gloomy color grading, action-packed shots, and the perfect amount of special effects which ultimately combine to create a beautifully produced episode that feels both believable and very scary — setting the bar high for the rest of the season.
Unfortunately, the next episodes suffer from having to follow this fierce opening. The season’s unoriginal second episode, “The Cursed Doll,” follows the tried and true, “Annabelle”-esque haunted doll trope. While the episode is definitely creepy, its fear factor pales in comparison to the prior episode. The third episode, “The Woman from El Molino” (which seems to be loosely based on the Latin American legend of La Llorona), is unfortunately no better. What’s most disappointing is the episode’s narrative, as the testimony leaves far too many unanswered questions to be enjoyable or satisfying. Thankfully, the underwhelming narratives of the second and third episodes are salvaged by the show’s high production value. The show’s immersive and impressive visuals at least somewhat make up for the storytelling’s failures.
“Haunted” was able to redeem itself with the season’s fourth episode, “Something’s Knocking at the Door,” which is another high point in the season. The storyline feels authentic and pairs well with reenactments. Unlike the first episode, though, where all the people who were part of the real-life testimony seem emotionally tied to the story, the testimony in “Something’s Knocking at the Door” has many participants who appear bored out of their minds. The show’s fifth episode, “The Devil Dances before Easter,” is nearly ruined by subpar special effects and CGI on top of an already so-so narrative. For anyone who can speak Spanish, this episode is best enjoyed like a podcast, as the visuals only cut detract from any storytelling strength the episode has to offer. With such a strong start to “Haunted: Latin America,” it’s disappointing to see it end with an even more mediocre episode than what’s found throughout the rest of the season.
Although the series does have its weaknesses, and at points feels almost like a glorified Spanish creepypasta, the full first season of “Haunted: Latin America” is still worth the three-hour binge-watch. While viewers may not be scared out of their minds at any point, the series is still creepy enough to deliver an enjoyable, chilling experience.

“Calls,” a new series that premiered on March 19 on AppleTV+, is television’s newest, and perhaps most puzzling, experiment. It also features an dazzlingly star-studded cast — you just won’t see any of their faces.
The show is creator Fede Álvarez’s adaptation of the French series of the same name (created by Timothée Hochet), and revolves around phone conversations that unfurl the central narrative alongside simple graphics. The real test is whether this unconventional drama will be able to hold its audience’s attention, or whether AppleTV+’s ambitious experiment in audio production isn’t what its audiences are looking for.
Each of the show’s nine episodes consists of a phone call between two or more members of the ensemble cast, usually taking place during a profoundly strange — perhaps supernatural — event. As the season moves forward, eerie connections and similarities between these conversations are drawn out, and the series of interrelated calls eventually reveals a terrifying truth larger than any of the characters had imagined. Not every episode is an effective standalone work of horror or science fiction, but much of the intrigue around its mysterious plot remains even when its story falters.
The show’s efforts to bring audio drama into the television space is just the latest development in the history of audio entertainment: Developed during the 1920s, radio drama and audio theater remained immensely popular through the 1940s and until the advent of television in the 1950s. Audio dramas seem to have made quite the return in the last few years: first in podcasting and now on the small screen itself.
For modern audiences accustomed to the spectacles of visual entertainment, sitting through a season of drama that can be heard but not seen may at first seem tedious, yet “Calls”’ combination of images and sound is novel and compelling in its use of visuals that are at once minimalistic and mesmerising. Innovative animation and graphic design techniques create colorful and dynamic visual soundwaves that supplement the audio storytelling nicely. These visuals undoubtedly add aesthetic interest to the show, but are they enough to justify what’s essentially a fiction podcast residing on a television streaming app? This is perhaps where the series falls shortest: Its blend of medium and production techniques don’t quite add up to a product that is stunning or original enough to necessitate the carving-out of a new television niche.
Though the connection between each of these phone calls is nebulous at first, “Calls” maintains a level of consistency across its short, dispersed episodes: Science-fiction antics aside, the technodrama’s true thematic core lies with an exploration of human relationships. The series opener follows Tim (Nicholas Braun) and Sara (Karen Gillan) navigating the trials and tribulations of long distance relationships; the consequences of bank robberies and secret affairs play out in an episode starring Pedro Pascal and Judy Greer; “The Beginning” introduces Rose and her boyfriend Mark, who unwittingly becomes an absent father due to a time glitch; “Mom,” with Joey King and Jaeden Martell, “It’s All in Your Head” with Rosario Dawson and Laura Harrier, and finale “Leap Year Girl” starring Aubrey Plaza, delve further into the complexities of family, asking its characters what their past selves would do with their present wisdom, and exploring what’s possible when time works differently.
And though the show’s melodrama sometimes requires a little suspension of disbelief on the viewer’s part — especially in its first few episodes — the show ultimately succeeds in delivering a relatively contained and suspenseful narrative arc. Taken together, the episodes weave together to reach across space and time, as each entry in the saga fills in gaps left by others. The narrative plays with metaphysical, existential, and apocalyptic themes as characters realize that glitches in each of their realities have been allowing people to communicate with each other across space and time. It’s when these conversations alter events in some fundamental way that even stranger and darker happenings seem to occur. These narrative points are also cleverly reflected in the show’s structure: An exercise in nonlinear storytelling, the show eventually teases out a handful of revelatory moments and connections between strangers’ phone calls that are satisfyingly chilling.
Will the show’s ambitious and experimental take on television revolutionize the medium? Hopefully not — truth be told, its audio format and minimalist visuals, impressive as they are, can feel tired quickly. For what it is, “Calls” is a noble attempt to revitalize radio drama in the mainstream, but it just seems to be in the wrong place: Its contents would work just as well as a podcast where its aims and bounds are more clearly defined. And does “Calls” make a deep, probing claim about the state of technology or family or culture today? Perhaps not, but it’s still fun to hear a handful of recognizable voices hash it out while trying to piece together a mystery or two.

If you’ve ever had the pleasure of spending an afternoon in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum on Evans Street, you may have noticed a handful of empty frames or strangely blank spaces on the gallery walls. These are the last traces of 13 pieces of art stolen on the night of Saint Patrick’s Day in 1990. To this day, none of the pieces have ever been found, no one has been formally charged for the heist, and the Gardner Museum website still lists a $10 million reward guaranteed to anyone who locates the missing art. This crime lies at the center of Netflix’s new limited series “This is a Robbery: The World’s Biggest Art Heist.” Produced over the course of seven years, the four-episode show aims to shed light on the 31-year-old mystery.
The Gardner Heist involves many strange details that make for a compelling mystery. The robbery was committed in an unprecedented 81 minutes, while most robberies are over in less than 10. A night watchman (who was later cleared by the FBI) deviated from normal museum security protocols on the night of the heist. One of the missing pieces came from a gallery room whose motion sensors were only activated by patrolling guards, but never the thieves. Some of the paintings — priceless pieces of art by artists like Rembrandt, Degas, and Manet — were brutally sliced from their frames instead of being removed normally. Other stolen pieces were worth barely any money. Unfortunately, the bizarre facts of the robbery are not enough to keep the series’ four nearly hour-long episodes engaging.
With this limited series, Netflix seems to be chasing the popularity of the murder miniseries “The Staircase” (added to Netflix in 2018) with limited success. “The Staircase” draws much of its tension from the gruesome nature of its central crime — an alleged murder of a spouse. No matter how much theory and suspicion surrounds the Gardner case, it ultimately boils down to a simple robbery entwined in a complicated web of organized crime. The limited series has too slow a pace for a story that’s bogged down in so many names and details.
The penultimate episode, especially, suffers from this. At the heart of the Gardner mystery is Boston’s deep history with both Irish and Italian mobs and organized crime, and the series goes to painstaking lengths to trace out an investigation of its many key players. This depth of explanation is detrimental to the series. It takes enough effort and focus to keep track of all the names being thrown around; to have them all come out with no real resolution feels almost insulting. It’s like finishing a marathon only to find out that the prize was a round of applause and not a gold medal. Even discussions of sightings of the paintings fail to move the pace along or add intrigue, since so much of the story seems to be unverifiable.
The series is well shot, has very clear and clean graphic design, and does an effective job of making Boston’s history approachable. Anyone interested in the Gardner Heist or anyone off-campus and desperately homesick for Cambridge will appreciate the shots of Boston streets, landmarks, and interior shots of the museum. There’s even a few shots of Harvard Square itself. But if given the chance, they might be better off watching only the first episode before wandering off to the Gardner Museum itself rather than consuming the remaining three hours of the series. An afternoon of asking employees or museum visitors what they think happened would garner just as many concrete answers as the limited series, and weave at least as rich a picture of Boston’s history.

As political polarization grows in America, calling it out is all the rage.
Sixty-eight percent of Americans call the lack of civility a major problem today. “Both-sides” is said so often that we need a verb for it. Joe Biden entered office vocally crushing on bipartisanship. All last year Mitt Romney amassed gold-stars for his short breaks from voting with Trump and the GOP.
At Harvard, recent calls to hire more conservative faculty bemoan the lack of ideological diversity among faculty members and warn of discussions having “only one correct side of the issue.”
Partisanship has two main drawbacks, one political and one personal. It can blind you to honest criticism, and it can damage relationships unnecessarily in the name of politics. In other words, you might miss Grandma’s reasonable point about government overreach, and you might ruin dinner with Grandma fighting when you could be putting politics aside and talking about, you know, crosswords.
These are understandable concerns, but in reality, neither is especially relevant today. For one, Grandma doesn’t make reasonable points anymore. She hasn’t since 2002 when Fox News took over cable media and her sanity.
The right has gone completely off the rails. The most prominent conservative voices today  — Tucker Carlson and Ted Cruz come to mind  —  spew tired conservative talking points that are equal parts imagination and white supremacy. Fewer than one in three Republicans believe climate change is human-caused. Sixty percent of House Republicans supported Texas’s lawsuit against the results of the 2020 election. The majority of Republicans think the flu is deadlier than Covid-19. Startling surveys have suggested moderate to widespread support for QAnon amongst Republican citizens.
But the truth is in the middle? Explain.
Reach across the aisle today and you will burn your hand in a dumpster fire. The people preaching civility and tolerance from the left are asking us to keep trying.
When it comes to personal relationships, civility doesn’t demand bipartisanship. I am nice to Grandma. My grandma is a sweet old woman who is brainwashed by Fox News. Her political contribution to my life is as a barometer of how far off the right has gone. It’s a character flaw, but at her age and with her background, a small one. Grandma and I get along just fine.
Too often, those lamenting polarization are unable to articulate exactly what personal or political costs it is incurring. They are our generation’s version of Martin Luther King Jr.’s white moderates: preferring “a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice.”
American Democrats who mean what they say need to make peace with polarization and commit to the pursuit and use of their power. Compromise with Senate Republicans is a pipe dream; the filibuster must go starting with H.R.1. If not now, then after the midterms. Washington D.C. should be added as a blue state with blue senators, and we should entertain a serious discussion about court-packing. Direct measures aside, marquee policies need to inoculate themselves against right-wing media criticism. For example: how easily will the right be able to convince minimum wage workers en masse that a raise in the minimum wage is bad for them? The game, as Derek Thompson puts it, is about “doing good and popular stuff in a way that keeps you in power so you can do more good stuff.”
As citizens, we would benefit from the same mindset shift: from an idealistic politics of truth, collaboration, and middle-paths to a politics of power. We should embrace polarization and the new attitudes and political strategies that come with it. If we are engaging with the right politically, it is to bring them to our side. Can you get your relative in a swing state to change their vote? Encourage a friend to understand their hidden biases and confront them? Get your friend to shut up about the pitfalls of polarization?
I can share from personal experience that waving a big fat sign that says “You’re an idiot,” even if it’s true and you desperately want to, doesn’t accomplish what you hope it will. But neither does blindly giving “the other side” credibility it doesn’t deserve. Listen too earnestly, and you risk losing sight of what’s right. Don’t listen enough, and you won’t understand someone’s actions enough to change them.
As Harvard students, we should reject the idea that Harvard would benefit from artificially balancing its political bent with more conservative faculty whose views are a minority in academia for a reason. Doing so would empower the right and give it undeserved legitimacy through the Harvard brand.
I guess my point is this: Instead of mounting a misplaced and counterproductive assault on polarization, be blunt about who is talking sense and who isn’t, listen only to people who are, persuade those who aren’t, and try not to burn bridges with Grandma along the way.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the past eight months or so, I’ve been writing a column based on the premise that Harvard is effectively “For Sale,” arguing, week after week, that our numerous controversial financial ties are improper of our institution. I’ve tried to claim the self-aggrandizing high ground on everything ranging from the opioid epidemic to tyrannical regimes — quite the unrealistic effort for an exiled freshman Spaniard.
But what if the crux of my column turned out to be, simply put, incorrect? What if tainted donations were, like Harvard insists, merely the means to a noble end?
I’d consider it intellectually cowardly not to at least attempt to probe the internal logic behind philanthropy fanatics. So let us inspect the University’s point of view, and let us do so through the one individual who has repeatedly been cited, by the administration and others alike, as a key source of sketchy donation positivity: former University President Derek C. Bok.
Bok, who was Harvard’s 25th University president from 1971 to 1991 and then interim University president from July 2006 to June 2007, has written repeatedly about the ethics of university gifts — in fact, he referenced his own writings when justifying his decision not to return convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s donations after his first indictment. His ideological framework is imperfect at times; in his 1982 book “Beyond the Ivory Tower,” he argues, for example, that limiting donations from tainted individuals would force a university to reckon with whether it should inspect the ethics of tuition payers, equating economic exchanges with honorific-laden donations, and incurs in some frustrating moral what-aboutism. But he can also prove deeply persuasive, and his reasoning frequently brought up when the awkward donor conversation arises.
Bok’s essential argument — the argument that effectively underlies our gift policy — is that, despite their ethical pitfalls, donations are a net good. In his famed 1979 open letter, he posits that, barring a few redlines and academic integrity notwithstanding, the “tangible benefits” of polemic giving ought to outweigh “the more abstract, symbolic considerations.”
His understanding relies on two seemingly self-evident premises: the assumption that investments in higher education benefit society and that obtaining them through less morally palatable channels doesn’t pragmatically hinder our educational mission. Or in blunter terms, if we can get substantial funding and use it to have a positive impact with few strings attached, why on earth shouldn’t we?
It’s a temptingly convenient idea — but then again, self-deceit usually is.
For what is more deceiving than convincing ourselves that we accept dirty money for the sake of the public good? Are University donations genuinely furthering the enterprises and academia and free knowledge to benefit society with no self-interest attached?
Perhaps we think it is. Bok assumes that if educational investments and academia are seen as forces for good, any given institution ought to lean towards taking any given gift, regardless of potential moral qualms.
But it’s hard to argue that any person seeking to maximize America’s academic output or societal educational achievement would choose to invest in Harvard, of all places. It’s simply a question of diminishing returns: Every extra dollar invested here could have more profoundly (and equitably) impacted the quality and quantity of American knowledge elsewhere. A $5 million donation to Harvard would barely make The Crimson’s front page, but could prove electrifying for an underfunded community college or historically Black university, radically improving the quality and quantity of their scholarship — yet it rarely gets to do so.
Any higher education funding system that allots donations in such an arbitrary fashion — massively prioritizing, for example, prestigious and wealthy institutions like our own — could certainly be said to benefit Harvard’s interests, but would surely run counter to those of society writ large. Maximizing our payoff within this paradigm wouldn’t serve laudable social goals, just grow our slice of the bittersweet pie.
If Harvard accrues almost the entirety of the benefits, everyone pays the not-so-abstract costs. The tangible burden of controversial donations falls, for one, on the graduate students who are forced to survive amidst the chaotic aftermath — take a look at the now-defunct Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, or the sunsetting-when-the-donor-is-accused-of-sexual-misconduct Dubin Fellowship. I’ve already written about the devastating toll of being caught up in the middle.
Some of the other presumably minor concessions that Bok mentions as acceptable in “Ivory Tower” are just plain bad for academia as a whole, going well beyond the scope of “abstract considerations.” He concedes how troubling it might be that eccentric donors restrict their gifts in eccentric ways, or that business schools become overfunded compared to philosophy departments. Unfazed, Bok is willing to accept both as unavoidable obstacles, saying that attempting to completely limit donors' freedom would run counter to a university's funding and, hence, academic freedom.
His shrugging acceptance is baffling. Isn’t the fact that only a tiny, extremely wealthy segment of the population gets to decide what academic work gets funded inherently bad? How can we knowingly underfund some fundamental disciplines in favor of trendy alternatives and conclude that our financial framework is anything but irreversibly broken?
That might be the most frustrating thing about the pro-philanthropy worldview: Bok and his supporters never deny that there’s a legitimate moral debate at hand, they never reject the pitfalls of relying heavily on donations (even if they undersell the costs and overrate the benefits). They simply lack the imagination or the will to view beyond our current funding system, discarding concerning trends as “troubling” but “inevitable.”
For a wealthy institution that benefits from nine-figure contributions like Harvard, doing so amounts to self-serving conformism hidden behind faux, though sincerely held, utilitarian justifications. It’s certainly easier than grappling with the sheer ugliness of our financial reality, less risky than investing our economic and institutional heft in interrogating who funds what and how, more personally rewarding than looking for alternative, less profitable paths forward.
But it’s a service to Harvard and Harvard only, at the cost of everything we are supposed to represent. Pretending otherwise is a fool’s game, and a naive one at that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For nearly 30 years, a grandiose 19,500 square-foot building in the center of campus has served as a hub for Jewish life at Harvard.
With three large prayer spaces, a beautiful circular courtyard, a Kosher dining hall that serves cultural staples each Friday night, and a plethora of full-time staff members, Harvard Hillel offers Jewish students the full range of religious activities, services, and possibilities for connecting with their faith, culture, and each other.
Most importantly, though, Hillel provides a refuge for hundreds of Jewish undergraduates, a place they know they can fall back on in times of need. In October 2018, after an anti-Semitic massacre at Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Hillel’s building was just that: a space for healing, comfort, and, most of all, safety, aided by an around-the-clock Harvard University Police Department patrol car stationed outside the front entrance.
Yet when trauma and grief shook the Black community after the deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Philando Castile, and numerous other Black men at the hands of police, no similar space was available for Black students to grieve, reflect, and process.
As hate crimes against Muslim Americans spiked in the wake of 9/11 and then again after the election of former president Donald J. Trump, the more than 200 Muslim students on campus did not have any similar space.
The space they did have? A musallah — or prayer area — in the basement of Canaday Hall, perhaps the ugliest dormitory on campus.
In other words, while Jewish students have a building devoted solely to their needs, Muslim students are relegated to a prayer space in an existing dormitory, and do not reap the benefits of a dedicated dining hall space like the one at Hillel, with daily food that conforms with not only Halal rules but also cultural traditions.
For 50 years, students have advocated for a multicultural center to provide a physical space for students from marginalized backgrounds. After decades of intransigence, the College finally announced a working group in 2019 to “examine” the broader issue of campus spaces.
It’s not as if the idea of a devoted space on campus for a marginalized community is particularly radical. The University of Virginia has a multicultural center. Yale University has an Afro-American Cultural Center, as well as centers for Asian Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans. Tufts University has multiple spaces devoted to marginalized communities as well. The University of California, Berkeley even has a center for undocumented students. The list goes on.
Whether a one-size-fits-all multicultural center is preferable to more narrowly tailored and culturally specific spaces is a difficult question that administrators should allow students to solve — constrained by reasonable financial considerations. But the necessity of at least one such space is not debatable. And it cannot be pushed down the road any longer.
The Jewish community at Harvard has been blessed with generous alumni and supporters — including, unfortunately, Jeffrey Epstein — and a national network called Hillel International that have helped to fund the construction of Harvard Hillel’s building and ensure its continued functioning. But it has also benefited from significant support from the Harvard administration, including the Hillel dining hall’s incorporation into the College’s meal plan.
So while it may be true that Harvard would have to devote more resources to a multicultural center than it has to Hillel, the University would not be engaging in something fundamentally different than it — or its peers — already does: recognizing that they have a responsibility to play in ensuring marginalized communities have dedicated spaces on campus.
After all, as a $1 billion facility in Allston for the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences opens for operation this fall, and as a $1.4 billion pot of money flows towards House renovations, it has become abundantly clear that this is not about a lack of money. If Harvard asked its donor base for a few million dollars — or more easily, just dipped into its savings — the funds for such a building or buildings would be forthcoming.
Before the adoption of a randomized housing system in the mid-1990s, the Quad came close to offering such spaces to at least some underrepresented students at the College. “Black students would lose the option of joining a substantial group of students who often share common bonds, interests and experiences,” wrote a Crimson columnist in a 1995 article, criticizing the proposed randomization scheme.
This is not to say randomization was a mistake or should be reversed. In fact, by properly scrambling the student body, the University has ensured that undergraduates are exposed to the full range of opinions, identities, and personalities in their class, a truly noble goal.
But by creating dedicated spaces for students from marginalized backgrounds to gather, the University would not jeopardize the current system in the slightest. In fact, it could even help Harvard’s admissions team in recruiting the best and brightest students from all backgrounds and walks of life, who will know that Harvard will give them the best of both worlds: a place to explore and a place to feel secure.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Spanking may negatively impact children’s brain development in ways similar to more severe forms of violence and abuse, a study published by Harvard researchers earlier this month found.
Three Harvard affiliates collaborated with researchers from the University of Washington and the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill on the study, which was published in the journal Child Development.
The research adds to a growing body of evidence linking corporal punishment to negative outcomes for children, but is the first of its kind to focus specifically on spanking. Previous studies have primarily focused on more severe forms of violence.
The researchers utilized MRI technology to examine the brain development of children ages 10 to 12. The research subjects included roughly 40 children who had experienced spanking, and roughly 140 children who did not experience spanking or more severe forms of violence and abuse.
During the brain scans, children were exposed to pictures of fearful faces, a stimuli that suggests there is an environmental threat present.
The results of the scans indicated a higher level of brain activity in multiple regions of the prefrontal cortexes of children who had been spanked than in children who had not been spanked. These are the same regions that show disregulation in cases of severe abuse such as physical violence and sexual abuse.
Kate A. McLaughlin, a Harvard psychology professor and co-author of the study, said spanking boosted activity in areas of the prefrontal cortex that are part of a “salience network.” Activity in these regions of the brain communicates that “there's something important in the environment that we need to pay attention to," she said.
“We think that what this likely reflects is increased mobilization of resources to help kids stay safe in dangerous environments,” McLaughlin said.
In the short term, activation in the prefrontal cortex can help children adapt to adverse environmental circumstances. In the long-term, however, the effect can be detrimental across a range of outcomes, predisposing children to mental health disorders like anxiety and depression and prompting violent or aggressive behavior.
The prefrontal cortex is “critical for self-regulation and for executive functioning in general,” according to Jorge A. Cuartas, lead author of the paper and a Ph.D student at the School of Education.
McLaughlin said the researchers deliberately chose to examine spanking as a form of corporal punishment. Spanking remains a common form of discipline in the United States; per a recent survey, one third-of parents report having spanked their children during the past year.
“Many parents still see it as acceptable and appropriate to spank your children as a form of discipline and hold positive beliefs about this type of punishment in terms of being an effective discipline tool,” she said.
Cuartas, who has advised the government of his home country, Colombia, on how to support children’s healthy brain development, said he believes the study's findings have international importance. In many parts of the world, including Columbia, corporal punishment is considered to be an effective measure of discipline.
Ultimately, Cuartas said that social support can determine how an individual recovers from experiencing spanking in early life.
“Different people can eventually arrive to completely different outcomes, because no single exposure is completely deterministic,” Cuartas said. “In general, we know that the brain is highly plastic. So our brain can change — it can heal from those exposures and eventually achieve positive results.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Paris Climate Agreement lead negotiator Christiana Figueres discussed the need for timely action to fight the climate crisis at the Kennedy School’s annual Robert S. McNamara Lecture on War and Peace on Thursday.
Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf and Kathryn Sikkink, a professor of human rights policy at HKS, moderated the event, which was co-hosted by the JFK Jr. Forum, the Institute of Politics, and the Harvard School of Public Health's Center for Climate, Health and the Global Environment.
Figueres, a Costa Rican diplomat who served as executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change from 2010 to 2016, said she feels optimistic about current progress in the fight against climate change. She noted that a “a critical mass” of countries have begun to take steps to curb their carbon emissions and that many wealthy institutions, including Harvard, have agreed to reach a net-zero carbon portfolio by 2050, consistent with the timeline of the Paris Agreement.
“We are beginning to see that we're turning the page on the understanding that acting on climate change is no longer a huge burden,” Figueres said.
Still, Figueres said that progress against climate change has been undermined by humanity’s prolonged “war with nature” in the industrial age.
“We're accelerating the pace of that war with the result that the last six years have been the warmest on record," Figueres said. "The concentrations of greenhouse gases have continued to increase in 2019 and 2020. 2019 saw the highest ocean heat level on record.”
Figueres outlined three phenomena that continue to exacerbate the consequences of climate change.
First, she said that targets and regulations “take a long time to translate into actual emissions reductions.” Second, the concentration of carbon will continue to increase in the atmosphere, even if emissions fall, due to its “cumulative nature.” Finally, she said that the global economy is in a period of “evident transition,” clouding the future trajectory of the climate crisis.
Figueres said she believes that the crisis has reached a critical point at which countries will have to decide whether to take action.
“Do we want to walk down a path of constant destruction and human misery, the likes of which we have never seen?” she asked. “Or do we actually want to wake up and say we're not condemned to that future?”
“My prediction is that we will look back at 2020 as the year in which we reached a turning point on emissions, the year in which we changed the trajectory from one of constant increase to one of decisive decrease in emissions,” Figueres said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Massachusetts General Hospital, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School, launched a new center to study the clinical benefits of psychedelics in treating mental illness.
The Center for the Neuroscience of Psychedelics comes amid a statewide push for psychedelic decriminalization, including acts passed in Cambridge and Somerville that specifically cite the possible medical benefits of substances like psilocybin, the active ingredient in “magic mushrooms.”
One of the Center’s first studies, to begin this spring, will examine psilocybin’s efficacy in mitigating rumination, a common feature of depression. The researchers also plan to explore the substance’s impact on cognitive and emotional processing, as well as on personality traits that make an individual susceptible to mental illness.
Center Director Jerrold F. “Jerry” Rosenbaum — MGH psychiatrist-in-chief emeritus and a HMS professor of psychiatry — said he was motivated to launch the Center after he attended a talk where he realized the potential psilocybin has to help patients for whom all other treatments are ineffective.
“There were changes in a key brain network called the default mode network, which almost seemed to defragment — like, lost its connectivity — and that's an interesting phenomenon because the default mode network is one we think is responsible for our ability to self reflect, to be aware of ourselves,” Rosenbaum said. “The default mode network is a network that is hyperactive in people who ruminate, and I said ‘Aha!’ — there's maybe something here for this.”
Before retiring as the chief of psychiatry, Rosenbaum focused much of his clinical and research career on treatment-resistant patients. He found many of these patients were experiencing rumination — obsessive and repetitive thoughts of one’s own distress — a process that underlies various mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety.
After attending the talk, Rosenbaum and his colleague Sharmin Ghaznavi began devising an experiment to better understand the potential impact of psilocybin on rumination.
“There haven't been a lot of game-changing drugs,” Ghaznavi, the Center’s associate director, said. “And these have the potential to be a game changer because they seem to have some fairly profound effects on people with a treatment resistant illness.”
When Rosenbaum and Ghaznavi reached out to the manufacturers of psilocybin to obtain some samples for their study, they not only offered their samples as a donation, but suggested the possibility of “something bigger” with psychedelic research at MGH.
Rosenbaum then gathered a team of researchers at MGH — including experts in neuroimaging, chemical neurobiology, and translational research — to form the Center, which he planned would delve deeper into the neuroscience of psychedelics.
In addition to psilocybin therapy, which has recently been granted breakthrough status by the FDA, the Center also plans to study other psychedelics — specifically MDMA and its potential to treat PTSD in veterans, according to Ghaznavi.
Jacob M. Hooker, the center’s director of translational biomarkers and a professor of radiology at HMS, said while it’s important to explore therapeutic possibilities, the Center is not prepared to advocate for a change in the legal standing of psilocybin and other substances.
“We're by no means at all advocating for any particular legal status or use model,” Hooker said. “What we want to do is, is really, really focus on how they can be used to manipulate the brain in positive ways therapeutically.”
“Unlike a lot of the world, we're not so much advocates or fighters for access; we're trying to understand how they work,” Rosenbaum noted. “That's why it's called the Center for the Neuroscience of Psychedelics, as opposed to the Center for the Use of Psychedelics or Decriminalization.”
Frank L. Gerratana, an activist with Decriminalize Nature Massachusetts, said the research alone is “great news” for the broader decriminalization movement, crediting medical research with pushing public opinion “in the right direction.”
“The more clear medical research on these types of things, especially research that ends with good results, the more likely it is we're going to see broader decriminalization,” Gerratana said. “What we're hoping is that as things progress in the state level, we'll be able to reach out to some of the researchers and see if they will be willing to provide information or even written or in-person testimony.”
This represents the first research on psychedelics at a Harvard affiliate in over six decades — since the controversial Harvard Psilocybin Project conducted by Timothy F. Leary and Richard Alpert, two members of the Psychology Department, between 1960 and 1962. The following year, Alpert was dismissed from the University for giving drugs to undergraduates, while Leary’s contract expired after he failed to meet his teaching responsibilities.
“There were some folks who were in the research world, I mean like here at Harvard, that I think got a little far out with [psychedelics],” Rosenbaum said. “Like the Timothy Leary story, which you know about, which ultimately was an embarrassment to all the people who were trying to be serious about these things and understand their potential.”
Michael K. Pollan, the author of "How to Change Your Mind" and a professor of the practice of non-fiction at Harvard, said the fact that this research is taking place despite the University’s history with psychedelics is a testament to its promise.
“It took some courage on Jerry’s part and some good salesmanship, obviously, to get approval, but it's a measure, I think, of how promising the research is,” said Pollan, who is one of the Center’s advisors. “Whatever the history is, there's something valuable in these substances that needs to be explored.”
“The lesson has been learned that we have to be much more judicious than we were,” Pollan added. “I think the culture is prepared to make a more realistic judgment of the risks and benefits of psychedelics.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Having scoured the internet for ways to pre-register for the Covid-19 vaccine since the beginning of April, Chloe E. Gambol ’24 said she felt “so giddy” when she finally found a slot.
“Excitement. Relief. Such intense relief,” she recounted.
Gambol said she worried about putting her family in danger by returning from school unvaccinated and knew she had to get the vaccine this week to receive the second dose before going home. She received her first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Wednesday and will receive her second dose on May 12, three days before she leaves campus.
Harvard students were among the hundreds of thousands of Massachusetts residents to receive the Covid-19 vaccine this week when eligibility opened to all those 16 years and older on Monday. With spots filling up quickly, students reported discovering open appointments in a number of ways: Twitter bot accounts tweeting newly available appointments, emails from proctors, and friends of friends.
And for students leaving campus in May, getting a vaccine this week is a matter of urgency. The Pfizer vaccine requires three weeks between doses; the Moderna vaccine requires four. Receiving the first dose of either vaccine later than this week means the second dose would be scheduled after May 16, the day the College is closing dorms for the semester.
Genesis G. Nam ’24 booked her first dose appointment for this coming Saturday at Boston’s Hynes Convention Center. Nam, who pre-registered just last week, said she feared she was too late until her teaching fellow directed her to schedule a vaccine appointment through Color, the portal through which students view their Covid-19 test results.
Still awaiting her first dose, Nam has already considered the timing of her second dose. Receiving the Pfizer vaccine would allow her to squeeze in the second dose before she leaves campus and returns home to Los Angeles, Nam said. But the four-week timeline of the Moderna vaccine would require her to look into options in California.
Another source of stress for Nam is the possibility of vaccine side effects during a generally busy time for students as final exams near.
“I don’t know how I’m going to react to the vaccine,” she said. “If I do get the second dose, I do have a final that week, which I’m also worried about, so it’s definitely something I have to plan out and really think about."
Nam said she hopes professors will grant students flexibility given the importance of getting vaccinated. Due to the complication of rescheduling finals, though, she said she would likely “just take the test sick” if she does experience side effects, which are more common for the Pfizer second dose.
Since midnight on Sunday, Estela Lacombe Franca ’23 said she monitored @vaccinetime, a Twitter bot notifying Massachusetts residents of available vaccine appointments.
Lacombe Franca said she originally scored an appointment for this coming Monday — but fearing she would leave campus prior to receiving both doses, she moved up her appointment by five days, receiving the first shot on Wednesday in Methuen. Lacombe Franca received the Moderna vaccine, meaning her second dose appointment falls in the middle of her first week of work and three days before she is set to move to New York.
“It turns out that I would either get it in the middle of finals or the first week of work, and it’s the first week of work,” she said.
Despite experiencing fatigue and body pains, Lacombe Franca said the vaccine was well worth it, and that she will “deal with” the prospect of moving with a sore arm when that time comes.
“Whenever people talked about getting vaccinated, I’d be like, ‘God, I can't wait for my turn,’” she said. “So I’ve been waiting for this for a while, and it was very exciting. I will take any side effects.”
Lacombe Franca added that her courses have been “very reasonable and accommodating” with her taking time off to recover from the side effects.
“My TF — I had to miss his section — was just so excited for me,” she said.
In search of a vaccine appointment, Jessica L. “Jessie” Bates ’24 scanned through vaccination site websites and pre-registered through the state website, but found nothing. Her blockmate finally found appointments through the @vaccinetime Twitter bot account, and her friend’s sister ultimately found her an even closer appointment. On Tuesday, Bates received her first dose of the Pfizer vaccine.
Ultimately, what mattered, she said, was who you know and where you are looking.
“A lot of it is word-of-mouth,” Bates said. “I’ve tried to look for vaccines online, and it’s just convoluted, confusing to work your way through the resources. Random sites will have spots open up, so it’s not like you’ll just happen upon them — something had to tell you.”
Gambol had a similar experience, searching through the state website and vaccine provider websites like CVS for possible pre-registrations before finally hearing about open slots at Hynes Convention Center from an email her proctor sent to her entryway.
Gambol noted that one reason why it is important to her she get vaccinated is that her family has stayed very cautious throughout the pandemic. Gambol said she was concerned about bringing the virus home, especially because her grandma is at risk.
“I’ve got family that I really want to see when I get home, but I didn’t want to put them in danger,” Gambol said. “My grandma is sick, and I really want to try and protect her.”

In 2015, Juan A. Espinoza, a current third-year student at Harvard Law School, spent his summer participating in one of the Law School’s enrichment programs. Espinoza recalled walking through a famous hall where the portraits of professors were displayed. He remembers asking himself how it was possible there was so little representation.
“How crazy is it that there isn’t a single Latino up on these walls?” Espinoza said. “I remember having a very visual image of custodial staff — two Latino immigrants — cleaning the portraits of these professors and yet, there being no one from my community or any Latino immigrants represented on the faculty.”
“They just don’t represent us here,” Espinoza said. “It’s true in the curriculum, it’s true in the classrooms, it’s true in the faculty, it’s true across all course offerings, it’s true in every resource office — we’re not represented here. We just are not, and they know it.”
Throughout his time as a student at the Law School, Espinoza — alongside peers, legal scholars from outside the University, and organizers — have dedicated themselves to shedding light on the lack of faculty diversity at the Law School and what they see as its harmful effects on students of color.
Though student advocacy efforts to hire more faculty of color and introduce a more diverse curriculum to the Law School continue today, these efforts are by no means exclusive to the present moment. Advocates have pushed for decades to reimagine and restructure the Law School’s approach to inclusive legal education.
Harvard Law School spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an emailed statement the Law School is “deeply committed” to continuing to increase diversity within faculty, staff, and the student body.
“There cannot be excellence without diversity, especially not in a law school,” Neal wrote. “Training great lawyers and leaders requires a community of people who bring different approaches, backgrounds, lived experiences, and perspectives to their work and their studies.”
On March 25, Harvard Law Today published an article about Nina Perales — vice president of litigation for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund — agreeing to teach the Latino civil rights course, “a history her work is helping to write.” Focusing on an interview with Perales herself, the article shed light on her fundamental values as both the vice president of litigation at the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and an educator.
Less than 24 hours after the article’s publication, Espinoza — a key organizer on behalf of increased course diversity at the Law School — posted a statement on Facebook which argued the “erasure of student advocacy (and our community) is loud and clear.”
“We fought for this class to be taught at Harvard Law School — but Harvard Law Today — the news organization for the school — refused to acknowledge or frame this story in terms of how much work we put behind this effort — and how excluded we are from these spaces of power,” Espinoza wrote.
One of the reasons why Espinoza said he is “constantly upset” with the lack of faculty and course diversity is because there exists a “huge gap” between the Law School’s understanding of its own efforts to heed student concerns and the reality of the situation.
“It’s not about getting recognition for the labor that we do, but rather that they actually address what’s happening,” Espinoza said. “That we get some sort of result.”
Perales acknowledged students’ continuous organizing efforts.
“I would love to see Harvard bring more to its curriculum that focuses on the Latino experience,” Perales said. “But it’s the students who’ve been working on this issue for all of these years and alumni as well, who bring the real expertise to the issue.”
Margaret E. Montoya, a member of the Law School class of 1978, said that during her time as a student, the “culture of the institution” was “unrelentingly white,” and she frequently experienced microaggressions from peers — comments they believed were “complimentary,” but Montoya describes as actually exposing their personal biases.
“For most of us who were there in those early days, it was a matter of survival,” Montoya said. “Our advocacy was around increasing the number of students.”
Montoya — who was also a member the Law School’s Board of Student Advisors — said she engaged in “constant debates” with the board about affirmative action and the importance of bringing diverse viewpoints to the University.
Near her graduation, when Montoya was the vice president of the board, she said members organized a banquet where the dean of the Law School was also present. Their parting gift to Montoya, she said, included a doll-house high chair because she was “a crybaby for affirmative action.”
“I still have that high chair,” Montoya said. “I cherish this idea that I was a crybaby for affirmative action, because I really think that I’ve never stopped.”
Massiel Leiva — co-president of La Alianza, a Latinx student organization at the Law School dedicated to Latinx issues — said in order to understand the lack of diverse faculty, it was critical to understand the hiring process and incentives themselves.
Leiva said she believes many elite law schools’ hiring committees — including Harvard — will generally favor candidates with prestigious distinctions and ties to the Law School.
“The unofficial thing that everyone knows is that they pretty much just look at people from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford that also were on Law Review, and also might have a PhD, and are also published, and also have incredible grades,” Levia said. “As you can imagine, that really narrows the pool of who is being considered.”
Leiva said a prevalent pattern in the 70s and 80s — one she said that continues to this day — was that despite Harvard making several offers to faculty of color, those individuals chose other institutions largely because of the dearth of diversity.
“They were like, ‘This environment is hostile, we don’t want to teach at a place where I am the token or the only, and the faculty at large doesn’t feel like it’ll be supportive to me, my scholarship, and my development,’” Leiva said. “‘Sure, I could do this because the students really want me here, but at what cost [to] my own professional development and reputation?”
With few faculty or hiring staff who can tell prospective candidates what the experience of being a person of color is at the Law School, Leiva said there is no “person on the inside” who can help “assuage” the anxieties of incoming professors who may be unsure of the environment.
Neal, the Law School spokesperson, wrote in an emailed statement that the Law School's hiring "actively seeks and recruits" scholars who "bring a wide variety of backgrounds and approaches," including Professors Guy-Uriel Charles, Christopher Lewis, and Alan Jenkins — scholars who specialize in race and the law — in recent years.
Beth S. Feldstein, the lead organizer for the People’s Parity Project and a third-year student at the Law School, said she attended at least two of the Law School’s curriculum committee meetings between 2019 and 2020, during which students can provide feedback and suggestions on courses.
“I attended both of those because I cared a lot about the demands that various student organizers were bringing,” Feldstein said. Several key concerns among students included hiring more professors of color, increasing the student spots for “black letter” or more standard legal courses, and offering more courses on critical race theory.
Feldstein said these once-per-semester meetings were not well-advertised by the administration, with the onus ultimately falling on students to proactively seek out and attend sessions. After the transition to online learning, students were required to register for Zoom meetings, which they felt offered less opportunity for open conversation, she said.
Neal wrote that the Law School values student input, and “regularly gathers thoughts and feedback” from students regarding curriculum and courses, citing student focus groups which have held four meetings in this semester alone.
“These focus groups are designed to enable robust discussion, are widely-advertised, and we were able to accomodate all who wished to attend this spring,” Neal wrote. “In addition, the faculty hiring committees also welcome and solicit input from students about excellent teaching and mentoring they’ve experienced from faculty who have visited at HLS.”
Hiring faculty of color to teach critical race theory has been another popular demand among students. Derrick A. Bell Jr., the first tenured African American professor at HLS, was one of the founders of the discipline itself and left the Law School due to a lack of Black female faculty.
“I remember somebody saying that Berkeley has ten different critical race theory professors,” Feldstein said. “I am not sure if that’s true, but if it is, it is an indication of Harvard being really behind the other comparable schools.”
Feldstein said a common, years-old administrative response during the curriculum meetings is that they are “trying.” She explained that when students request more “concrete details” or “measures of accountability,” however, the explanations they receive are more elusive than clarifying.
“Students have been bringing up these same issues for years at every curriculum committee meeting,” Feldstein said.
When students mentioned that the Law School only had two Latinx professors with tenure despite Latinx people making up 20 percent of the United States’ population, administrators responded that they were “looking at one or two people,” which Feldstein said she thought was insufficient.
“They didn’t answer my question about whether they’d actually made any offers to either Latinx professors or critical race theory professors,” Feldstein said. “They talked about their hiring process generally, the goals that they focus on when they bring people back for interviews and the differences between their entry-level hiring for professors and their lateral hiring.”
Megan G. Jones ’16, the co-president of the Law School’s Alliance for Reproductive Justice, said during her first year, there were no course offerings on reproductive rights or justice. Jones said she was caught by surprise considering how “central” the topic of abortion is during “every Supreme Court term.”
“Given how fundamental a role reproductive rights and abortion specifically play in Supreme Court decision-making and in law and politics more broadly, I was stunned that the HLS curriculum is missing that piece,” Jones said.
Including reproductive rights and justice courses, Jones said, was both “personally and professionally” pertinent.
Neal wrote that the Law School offered two courses in reproductive rights this year, “Reproductive Rights and Justice” and “Reproductive Technology and Genetics: Legal and Ethical Issues.”
“The issue is also covered in other courses, including ones that focus on areas such as constitutional law, health law, and comparative law,” he added.
Nicole M. Rubin, the incoming co-president of the Law School’s Alliance for Reproductive Justice, said she understood why the leading scholars on the subject would be reluctant to accept a job offer at Harvard considering the lack of reproductive rights scholars present.
“When other schools have these incredible reproductive justice programs, I understand why as a scholar, you’d rather be in the company of these incredibly accomplished people and the schools that are willing to fund your research and really put effort into it,” Rubin said.
“It felt devaluing to me that I wasn’t able to learn about the system that constantly tries to keep me out of the economy and the political world,” Rubin added.
Emily B. Marcus — the other incoming co-president of the Law School’s Alliance for Reproductive Justice — said that, according to a research project which was presented to the dean, one in three law schools offer reproductive rights courses. Many of such schools are Harvard’s top competitors.
“Most of these schools have classes, and they also have clinics,” Marcus said. “Meanwhile at Harvard, we not only have no clinical offerings but we also have Federalist Society members who come to every curriculum meeting, insisting that we start a pro-life clinic — the landscape is just very different.”
David J. McKenna, a third-year student and steering committee member of the Law School’s Critical Race Theory conference, said that there is only one critical race theory course offering — an “always oversubscribed” reading group which “allows 10 students out of a student body of 1600.”
“There’s this huge demand to engage with what’s happening with the police murders and like, ‘What do we do about this, what does the law have to say about it?’” McKenna said. “The law had nothing to say about it in the first-year curriculum, it doesn’t exist.”
Espinoza described creating reading groups to be the “bare minimum” the Law School could do to increase course diversity.
“At Yale, you could make your own reading group as a student and you come up with a topic,” Espinoza said. “We don’t want that, we want actual courses, we want actual faculty to be hired that represent our community, we want Latinos to be embedded into the curriculum.”
“We want there to be an actual, institutional effort that has teeth, support, and funding behind it,” Espinoza added. “Which has not been put in writing, which has not been committed to, and the school clearly and blatantly will not do.”
Zoe Russell, a founding member of the Law School’s Bell Collective for Critical Race Theory alongside fellow law students McKenna and Olivia M. Castor ’17, said her organization is hoping to “implement more institutionalized spaces,” including co-education groups where students can teach and learn various aspects of critical race theory.
“We’re hoping that this model will let HLS know that critical theory is something that is valuable and important to every part of legal practice and application, regardless of whether you’re going into a firm or you’re dedicating your life to public interest,” Russell said. “That this is something that they need to invest more in.”
Neal wrote that the Law School was “committed” to teaching courses about race and racial justice, “subjects that are woven into the fabric of countless courses.”
Castor, a second-year student and steering committee member of the Law School’s Critical Race Theory conference, said that Harvard should introduce more “context-rich courses,” unlike many of the standard classes where professors actually instruct students to disregard background information and personal experiences when approaching a case.
“That is not at all how the law works,” Castor said. “You have judges who are deciding the law, you have legislators who are writing a law — all these people are human beings. The idea that they go in and they’re able to somehow strip themselves of context when they’re deciding which way they want to enshrine doctrines makes absolutely no sense.”
Espinoza said there have been countless incidents where individuals of color at the Law School have expressed discontent over a lack of diversity reflected both in faculty and curriculum.
In one case, Professor Derrick Bell left Harvard due to a lack of female faculty of color in 1990 and never returned. Thirty years ago, Espinoza said that students — including members of La Alianza — were still staging sit-ins and protesting due to a lack of professor diversity.
Montoya, the chair of the inaugural Critical Race Theory conference and a graduate of Harvard Law School, wrote about the various difficulties of navigating the legal space as a Latina scholar in the Chicano-Latino Law Review back in 1994.
“[My class cohort] is the first generation of Latinas to be represented in colleges and universities in anything approaching significant numbers,” Montoya wrote. “But, for the most part, we find ourselves isolated.”
“Rarely has another Latina gone before us. Rarely is there another Latina whom we can watch to try and figure out all the little questions about subtextual meaning, about how dress or speech or makeup are interpreted in this particular environment,” she added.
In her 2002 article published by the Harvard Latino Law Review titled “Challenging a Tradition of Exclusion: The History of an Unheard Story at Harvard Law School,” Luz E. Herrera provides a “historical account and analysis” of student advocacy to hire Latino faculty and “critiques the criteria” of the Law School when hiring faculty.
From the development of the Chicanos at Harvard Law School in the fall of 1970 to students’ efforts to “press the faculty” at a faculty forum in 1983, efforts to increase both student and faculty diversity have stretched on for decades. Despite then-Chairman of the Faculty Selection Committee Alvin C. Warren’s claims that the Law School’s 15-year effort to hire minorities was hindered by “the size of the pool of applicants,” students argued the Law School was “not doing enough.”
“For almost thirty years, Latino students at Harvard Law School have been telling a story that warns the institution of a poisonous element,” Herrara wrote. “Their story addresses the need for mentors, role models, curriculum development and institutional support in an institution that prides itself on excellence.”
Espinoza still clearly remembers an exchange during the Law School’s admitted students week in 2017, when he was still considering whether to commit to Harvard. Martha L. Minow, the then-dean, was speaking about the school’s focus on diversity and how administrators had ensured that no individual felt they were the “one of their community.”
“I raised my hand in front of the 200 or some admits that were there and said, ‘Well, there’s one Latino now, Andrew Crespo,’” Espinoza said, referring to a professor of the Law School. “How do you feel about that and the fact that we’re not very represented here?”
Neal wrote that the Law School recognizes it must continue to improve diversity at the school.
“While this has been a challenging year, we believe these efforts have allowed us to continue to deepen our community and the sense of belonging among those within it,” Neal wrote. “But there is much work still to do, and we will continue working to foster the sense among all members of our community that this is their Harvard Law School.”
Many programs and initiatives of the Law School, Neal wrote, also reflect the “considerable resources” the institution invests into addressing questions of race and social justice, including Professor Andrew Crespo’s Institute to End Mass Incarceration and the development of the American Journal of Law & Equality, spearheaded by Professors Randall L. Kennedy, Cass R. Sunstein ’75, and Minow.
Espinoza — who is also organizing on behalf of Latinx in his own county in California, where Latinx have experienced the highest level of death rates as a result of the pandemic — said he has largely “let the school go” in regards to his advocacy.
Espinoza wrote in his Facebook statement that despite the lack of acknowledgement from the Law School’s administration, he was glad that “amazing people like Nina Perales” have been acknowledged, and was grateful to have read important legal cases concerning Latinx civil rights during the reading group, such as Hernandez v. Texas and Serna v. Portales.
“Harvard Law School never planned on giving us these tools,” Espinoza wrote. “We fought for them at every step of the way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 23, 2021 at 6:30 p.m.
Young Americans, especially people of color, are significantly more hopeful about the future of the country than they were four years ago, according to a Harvard Institute of Politics youth poll released Friday.
The IOP’s Harvard Public Opinion Project conducted the national poll of 18-29 year olds from March 9-22, surveying 2,513 young Americans about their views regarding issues including “the Biden administration’s first 100 days, the future of the Republican Party, mental health, and the impacts of social media.”
The IOP has conducted regular polling of young Americans for over 21 years, examining their political views and social trends, according to a press release.
In the fall of 2017, an HPOP survey showed that only 31 percent of young Americans were hopeful about the country’s future; today, that number has jumped to 56 percent.
The changes in hope among people of color were largest. In 2017, just 18 percent of Black American respondents said they felt hopeful about America. This poll — taken before the former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of murdering George Floyd — revealed that now 72 percent of young Black Americans feel hopeful about America, a 54-point increase. The number of Hispanic youth who said they feel hopeful jumped 40 points, from 29 percent in 2017 to 69 percent today.
HPOP, an undergraduate study group at the IOP, is headed by John Della Volpe, Director of Polling at the IOP, and Jing-Jing Shen ’23, who serves as student chair.
In the press release, Shen said the results suggest Generation Z remains optimistic and trusting, despite recent increases in partisanship.
“These results speak to the resilient and confident character of young people,” she said. “Despite personal worries, racial unrest, a polarizing climate and disillusionment with politicians, government, and big tech, we’re still hopeful, and we want to actively create a better future for our country.”
Della Volpe said in the release that he believes this year’s youth poll had revealed the “power” of politics.
“With a new president and the temperature of politics turned down after the election, young Americans are more hopeful, more politically active, and they have more faith in their fellow Americans,” he said.
The poll found that more young Americans today consider themselves politically active than in 2009, an increase from 24 percent to 36 percent.
The poll also found an increase in progressive values since 2016, with an increasing number of respondents agreeing with affirmative action (a 19 point increase, now 33 percent), higher spending to reduce poverty (a 16 point increase, now 61 percent), and the benefits of recent immigration (an eight point increase, now 37 percent).
In addition, 55 percent of this year’s survey-takers agreed that the government should sacrifice economic growth to prevent climate change, an 18 point increase from 2016. Furthermore, 64 percent said that basic health insurance is a right, and the government should pay for it if someone was not able to afford it (a 16 point increase).
According to the poll, 59 percent of 18-to-29-year-old Americans approve of the overall job performance of President Joe Biden, who will mark 100 days in office next week. Sixty-five percent approve of his handling of the coronavirus, 58 percent of climate change, and 57 percent of race relations.
Forty percent of young Americans expect their lives to become better under the Biden presidency, rather than worse (19 percent) or the same (25 percent). Significantly, 54 percent of Blacks and 51 percent of Hispanics expect their lives to become better.
Forty-six percent of young Americans said they feel included in Biden’s America, as compared with 27 percent who said they felt included in former president Donald Trump’s America.
The poll also surveyed respondents about their mental health. More than half of respondents said they were going through “an extended period of feeling ‘down, depressed, or hopeless’ in recent weeks,” and 28 percent have had thoughts of hurting themselves in some way.
More than half of the college students surveyed reported that their mental health has been harmed by school or work-related issues in the two weeks prior to taking the survey.
“We won't be able to do this generation service without talking about the burdens that they carry, significant challenges related to the state of their mental health,” Della Volpe said in a Friday morning press conference. “Despite that, though, young people are as engaged in America, as we've seen in the history of this poll. And they feel excited to be part of this new chapter of America.”
Around half of young Americans said the U.S. government should do more to regulate big tech, and more than three-quarters of youth have little trust in Facebook or Twitter “to do the right thing.” Less than a quarter of young Americans said that social media’s impact has been positive on both their mental health and American democracy.
Additionally, 31 percent of 18-29 year olds say that politics has gotten in the way of a friendship. Controversy around race relations has proved divisive to friendships, with the poll revealing that 44 percent of young Americans say they could not be friends with someone who disagrees with them on the issue.
The poll also found that young people have recognized a rise in partisanship and selfishness in politics, and that three-quarters of American youths agree on the need for more “open-mindedness” in politics.
Sixty-eight percent of youth said they believe Biden won the election fairly, though only 26 percent of young Republicans said the same. One-third of Republican respondents said that Trump had responsibility in inciting the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6, while 88 percent of Democrats felt the same way.
Thirty percent of young Americans said that history will judge Trump as “the worst president ever.”
Shen said at the press conference that the results illustrate a misconception about young people in America today.
“It seems like as much as our generation has been written off as divided and apathetic, the truth is, we do care. We care a lot,” Shen said.

Did you feel a shift in the universe as you donned your favorite salmon-shorts-plus-Canada-Goose prep casual combo? As of last week, a major perk of joining one of Harvard’s many consulting and consulting-adjacent clubs was phased out of production. That’s right, econ concentrators — Patagonia announced plans to “transition away” from adding additional non-removable logos to its products, citing that additional logos decrease the lifespan of garments and end up in landfills far too soon. Clearly the future of fintech casual is in jeopardy.
It’s honestly super insensitive of Pata to prioritize the planet. I mean, how the hell are we supposed to announce that we passed a ~selective~ comp without, like, actually announcing it? The fleeces were so subtle and definitely did not have mega-douchey connotations. But, hey, there’s a bright side to this dreadful news! Now, the UC can spend its money on something useful — like, literally anything useful would be nice, guys.
So, since there’s basically no reason to comp HCCG, HFAC, HUCP, and HFUCK without the Wall Street staple, we’ve gone to the trouble of brainstorming (free of charge!) a few replacement swag items to help our favorite finance clubs stick around.
It’s Time To Level Up
Patagonia might’ve moved on, but there’s no chance Canada Goose will be making similar moves any time soon. Just think of how slick a Black Diamond x Canada Goose puffy would look, y’all. (I mean, we’re not sure if you guys are still doing the whole paying-$1000-to-be-in-a-club-thing, but if you are, an extra jacket should be no sweat…)
Loopholes, Baby
Sure, Patagonia is nixing additional non-removable logos, but what about removable logos? The vision: a tier system within the Patagonias themselves. Clubs could rip off the Girl Scouts and make removable patches indicating whether you’re a New Recruit, Super Legit Analyst Guy, Portfolio Emperor, or what have you.
Branded Razor Scooters
We know your GCals are horrifyingly stacked, so consider the free advertising / flex of a shiny Razor scooter bearing your finance club’s insignia as you rush from one building to the next on the absolute Chad of campus transport.
A Biodegradable Windbreaker
It slowly decays over time — just like your morals!
While we’re sad to see the beloved branded Patagonia go, we’re excited to see how the clubs of Harvard adapt to the challenge! Go get ’em, y’all!
