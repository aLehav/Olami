After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In addition to its ability to provide entertainment and its irreplaceable value as a medium for conveying information, discontent, and praise, rap’s financial payoff puts many successful artists in a position to give back to their communities and help minorities in need. Artists often seize this opportunity. Chance the Rapper founded Social Works, a charity that seeks to support Chicago youth through education, arts, and community leadership; Jay-Z established the Shawn Carter Foundation, which provides scholarships for economically underprivileged youth, and often financially supports the Black Lives Matter movement; Pusha-T famously rapped about how he sent water to those with contaminated water sources in Flint, Michigan; and Akon is well known for his Akon Lighting Africa project, for which he has planned to provide hundreds of communities in multiple African countries with electricity. An abundance of other rap and hip-hop artists have performed comparable charitable actions, instituting a pattern of positive behavior into rap’s culture.
Many up-and-coming rappers have similar benevolent aspirations. One such artist, Travis Karter, whose legal name is Kristofer Madu, is making waves through his philanthropic pursuits. Although just a freshman at Johns Hopkins University, Karter has started a non-profit organization in addition to dropping tracks and touring cities in the U.S. His charity, Water is the Answer, has served to raise nearly $10,000 for the construction of a sanitary well in Arondizuogu, Nigeria, and Karter maintains that this is only the beginning. He aims to expand the reach of his charity to other communities, and though he is of Nigerian descent, he doesn’t wish to limit himself to helping those with whom he shares a common background. “There is no reason on earth why Water is the Answer should stick to the confines of Arondizuogu, the confines of Nigeria, or the confines of Africa, when poverty and water poverty does not… In the long term, my goal for ‘Water is the Answer’ is to expand it into all continents, save for Antarctica, of course,” Karter said.
Karter’s plan is to get other students involved in this endeavor. “I plan on registering Water is the Answer as a student organization, and then I hope to expand Water is the Answer to the point of having it as a national organization, [with] chapters at universities all across the country. And then, at each university, there will be designated ‘Water is the Answer’ ambassadors… Students can become volunteers and participate in this widespread battle against water poverty, and make it something that we can do together, despite the boundaries between states, and between cities in which colleges are located,” he said.
When asked about his own college life, and how he is able to balance his charity as Kristofer Madu and his rap career as Travis Karter, he insisted that his actions consist not of balancing, but of joining. Karter maintains that philanthropy is an integral part of his rap identity. “You can turn on any artist’s song and then not know that [philanthropy] is what they do in real life. You have to either hear about it or see and re-tweet it on your twitter feed. But you can’t listen to my album, ‘Phase III,’ or even look at the cover, which has a water droplet and the Water is the Answer logo at the bottom right, or even the fact that on the very cover, water is being poured over my head, symbolic of the purpose of the album, [and not know what I do]. My philanthropic drive is legitimately just as much a part of my music as the 808 kicks on my hardest song,” Karter said. So central is this philanthropic theme to his career aspirations that he donates all proceeds from his music, and clothing line to his charity.
This motif of “giving back” is prominent in rap’s culture. Though this benevolence often benefits communities from which rappers come—communities which are often comprised largely of black Americans—this philanthropy is far-reaching and affects a large range of people, from Continental African, to Indian, to underprivileged Americans, to college graduates. Like many other artists, Travis Karter directed his philanthropy first towards his roots, and subsequently decided to branch out. When rappers not only aid their respective communities, but also extend their giving to the world at large, the power of rap’s philanthropic culture is even more apparent.

In today’s musical discourse, the term “DIY,” short for “do-it-yourself,” has connotations outside the bounds of its literal meaning; music tagged as “DIY” is often lo-fi and relatively simple in its composition and/or lyrics, and it tends to favor emotion over intellect. To the extent that music criticism tends to praise complexity and deride simplicity, DIY music is interested in creating a new set of values by which to evaluate music. Artists like Frankie Cosmos and Mac DeMarco exemplify this scrappy conception of DIY on a national level, and many less famous performers around the country make similar music in local scenes.
50 years ago, however, we saw a glimmer of a divergent vision of DIY music, and it came in the form of The Zombies’ album “Odessey and Oracle.” Plenty has been written about the greatness of “Odessey and Oracle”’s individual songs, but I want to focus on what seems to be an under-appreciated facet of the album: Its implicit suggestion that DIY music can be just as refined as high-budget, professionally produced music. “Odessey” was largely created in accordance with the literal meaning of DIY, but its songs are sophisticated to a degree that little of today’s DIY music dares to match, and its intricacy stands as proof that a DIY process can lead to a conventionally elegant product.
The Zombies are a British band whose fortunes rose with the successful singles “She’s Not There” and “Tell Her No” in 1964 and fell soon after, when the hits stopped coming. In 1967, after two years of minimal chart success—an eternity in the ’60s, when many acts released multiple albums a year—The Zombies decided to record one more album before breaking up. Executives at their label, CBS Records, both allowed them to self-produce and funded them, an uncommon arrangement at the time that helped the band get to work.
Much of “Odessey and Oracle’’’s DIY-ness was born out of these circumstances. For one, The Zombies could not afford to hire outside musicians when they wanted to augment the sound of their rock combo lineup (drums, bass, guitar, keyboard, and vocals). Their more successful contemporaries, like The Beatles, The Beach Boys, and Simon and Garfunkel, had access to massive budgets and regularly hired the best players in London, Los Angeles, and New York, respectively, but financial realities forced the Zombies to Do It Themselves. Not a single note on “Odessey” is played by a non-band-member. Instead of string and horn overdubs, many of its songs feature string- and horn-simulating sounds played on a Mellotron, a forerunner of early synthesizers. The Mellotron wasn’t even theirs—it had been left at EMI Studios, where much of the album was recorded, by John Lennon. (EMI is now known as Abbey Road Studios, and The Beatles did most of their recording work there.) And besides the Mellotron, there are relatively few overdubs on the album; most of the arrangements simply feature each band member on his typical vocal and instrumental parts.
Furthermore, The Zombies made “Odessey and Oracle” without a formal producer, while most other bands benefitted from a producer’s assistance with arrangement and performance decisions as well as technical matters. The Beatles had George Martin, Simon and Garfunkel had Roy Halee, and although the Beach Boys self-produced, bandleader Brian Wilson was an experienced producer by the time they made their acknowledged masterpiece, “Pet Sounds.” For “Odessey,” The Zombies had professional recording engineers for technical support but no one to serve as a Martin/Halee-style artistic midwife for their songs. Instead, band member Rod Argent served as an informal producer, dictating arrangements in addition to playing keyboards, singing, and writing five of the album’s 12 songs (bassist Chris White wrote the others).
A tight budget and lack of a producer are two common hallmarks of DIY music, and “Odessey and Oracle” is not entirely without the roughness that those limitations can cause. Some of the recordings sound thin and brittle—compare “I Want Her She Wants Me” to any track from “Revolver,” “Pet Sounds,” or “Bookends”—likely because Argent and White mixed them themselves, and the Mellotron string and horn parts often sound lo-fi and obviously fake. In these respects, “Odessey” bears some sonic similarities to mainstream modern DIY music. The album stands out, though, because it is not defined by its amateur moments. The instrumental performances, particularly Argent’s baroquely intricate piano and White’s melodic bass, are captivating and more than make up for the lack of “Pet Sounds”-style overdub density, and lead vocalist Colin Blunstone sings with a very un-punk choirboy grace. Listen to “Hung Up on a Dream,” “Brief Candles,” and “Beechwood Park” to hear Argent, White, and Blunstone working their respective magics.
Additionally, no recording, no matter how amateurish, could hide the sophistication of Argent and White’s compositions. Nearly every song is full of harmonic and melodic surprises, and almost every surprise feels called-for once it happens. Check out the deftly navigated modulations in “A Rose for Emily,” the shortened vocal melody in the last verse of “Maybe After He’s Gone,” or the unexpected major chord in the chorus of “Time of the Season;” each moment defies expectations, but at no point do the surprises themselves take center stage or detract from the songs’ other elements. Compare any of those tracks to the Beach Boys song “Girls on the Beach,” which abuses the upward chromatic key change. Sure, the song defies expectations, but it hits the listener over the head with key changes. Argent and White’s songs are much more tasteful, surprising the ear in subtler ways, and no less technically intriguing.
It is easy to guess why today’s DIY musicians tend not to emulate “Odessey and Oracle.” First of all, Rod Argent’s many years of classical music training likely helped significantly to hone his playing, writing, and arranging. Most musicians have not been trained extensively, some not at all, so an Argent-level instrumental proficiency and grasp of music theory is likely rare in the DIY world. Moreover, not many of the songs on “Odessey” are commercially oriented, so it is no wonder that the album has not been a relied-upon template for subsequent bands. Someone seeking musical success today should probably write a three-chord singalong rather than imitating “Changes” or “Butcher’s Tale.” Still, “Odessey” demonstrates that DIY music need not be defined by scrappiness or invested in changing the definition of musical greatness. Its story is one of a DIY album that strove for conventional greatness and unquestionably achieved it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Champagne Papi” returns to “Atlanta”’s all-Van episode format. Director Amy Seimetz, who also directed the previous Van-focused episode, seems to have gained a good enough understanding of who Van is to warrant another turn behind the camera. Unfortunately, Van can’t say the same for herself. Now that she and Earn are over—again—after Episode Four’s disastrous date night, Van is in need of a pick-me-up. She can’t stop glaring at her phone—to e-stalk Earn, only to see him in another woman’s arms already—that she dropped in the tub while bathing Lottie. “Uh-uh, no. We not talking about Lottie, we not talking about children, we talking about liquor,” her friend interrupts. It’s the distraction Van needs, but it’s not the “Atlanta” we came for.
Donald Glover continues to draw on recent films as inspiration for Season Two. What he has yet to learn, unfortunately, is that he cannot rely on his idiosyncrasies to make the narratives he borrows from any more original. Jordan Peele’s “Get Out,” to which “Helen” made some facetious references that worked, albeit barely, also serves as the template for Glover’s twisted reimagining of the film in “Teddy Perkins.” This time, it’s Malcolm D. Lee’s turn with “Girls Trip.” Van decides to ring in the new year with her girlfriends at a party—Drake’s party, allegedly.
The episode starts out as a surprisingly normal pregame to a fun night. “I got an IUD to block the K-I-Ds,” one friend says, before everyone chimes in about the merits of using birth control, from the copper IUD to tried and true condoms. “How old are you? You’re still using condoms? Are you in high school?” Van berates Nadine (Gail Bean), who defends the form of contraception: “You know what, I don’t have kids, and I also don’t have HPV, trick.” The conversation reads like any other group of girls’, but for a show that brands itself on its unconventionality, it feels too normal—out of place in a season featuring an alligator as police diversion and Donald Glover in whiteface. It confuses this season’s tone: Must Van fall back into the stereotype of the newly-single girl looking for a rebound? Why should Nadine defend her choice of contraception? Where, exactly, does “Robbin’ Season” begin and end?
The show throws in some twists to keep things interesting, but they land with a dud: Cue Nadine taking an edible and having a bad trip. Cue Van losing sight of her intoxicated friend in favor of a creep she finally eludes in the basement. Cue Nadine and Darius—where did he even come from?—having the most aggressively stereotypical high conversation known to man: “You’re a simulation,” Darius insists. “Can you help me stop thinking?” Nadine pleads. “Perhaps,” Darius whispers. The twists become tropes the show undoes lazily. There is nothing fresh about Nadine and Darius’ conversation. There is no anticipation in Van’s exploration of Drake’s mansion. The episode goes nowhere—and that might have been the point. But in a season that has felt aimless from the start, the point gets lost in the show’s lack of general direction.
“It’s all fake. There’s no Drake. So don’t ruin your high and enjoy yourself,” Van sighs after a disappointing night at the party. Her disenchantment with the fakeness she witnesses at the party is a theme already so thoroughly explored this season, it becomes redundant. She has become disillusioned, and at this point, so have I.
High Takes:
1. If this is a simulation, can someone please wake me up?
2. If all Nadine concludes at the end of the night is that “we’re all nothing,” she must have taken a gummy from a disappointing batch.
3. Before you complain that Tammi plays the Angry Black Woman, it’s time for another Google search of the week: “Beautiful Woman.” I’m sure you can guess what you’ll find.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
College campuses have frequently been characterized as liberal bubbles, “safe spaces,” or, more specifically here at Harvard, the “Kremlin on the Charles.” While all of these monikers have merit, the reality of campus politics and dialogue as it stands today is far less bleak. Though last year’s Crimson Senior Survey found only 10 percent of graduates identified as “conservative or very conservative”—compared to 23 percent who identify as “very liberal”—this is still a far cry from the days of the John Reed Club and “The Harvard Communist.”
As President of the Harvard Republican Club, I won’t tell you that being a Harvard Republican will always be easy. It won’t. But I will strongly encourage you to resist shying away from this campus for that reason. While being conservative at Harvard may be quite a different experience to being conservative in my home state of Alaska it comes with its own unique advantages. As an engaged, vocal conservative, I have been challenged to hone my arguments, accept the pervasiveness of liberalism in higher education, and allow my worldview to be questioned. It is the same for my fellow members of the Republican Club. This experience is invaluable and, consequently, gave me the most eloquent, inquisitive role models to learn from as an incoming freshman.
The Harvard Republican Club was my first home on campus. I was lucky to be brought in from my first day on campus and to have remained involved since. That’s not to say that it’s a homogenous or inflexible community. There are disagreements, and we welcome a diversity of opinion. One of the most toxic misconceptions about college Republicans is the notion that any one set of views is correct or will represent all or most of the campus. That is why the Harvard Republican Club specifically seeks to embody former President Ronald Reagan’s big tent party, allowing, as we say, anyone to the right of Marx to join. Our club’s internal surveying this past winter showed our membership as 48 percent fiscally conservative and 37 percent conservative-leaning, but not necessarily Republican. 70 percent are registered with the Party. The differences in opinion, background, and beliefs among Harvard conservatives allow for dynamic discussion and are part of what makes me love the community all the more. Rejecting the establishment of a litmus test or requirement to subscribe to a particular strain of conservative thought maintains the club as a collective of partisans, but not ideologues.
Outside the club at Harvard, things are somewhat different. Professors and teaching fellows vary in their degree of acknowledgement of the idea of conservatism as a valid system of principles, and any conservative on campus can recount for you a particularly frustrating lecture that devolved into liberal diatribe and scoffing at conservatives. That said, meeting with TFs or professors during office hours has usually allowed for dynamic discussions and respect, despite differences in opinion. Within the Institute of Politics, staff members are incredibly conscious of the importance of political diversity and strive to keep the organization nonpartisan. Students, however, are sometimes less so, often out of passionate disagreement.
There are also great opportunities for collaboration between student groups. The Harvard Republican Club, Harvard Right to Life, John Adams Society, and Network of Enlightened Women host a collaborative reception for conservative students at Visitas and host another in the fall. Meanwhile, there is some bipartisan collaboration as well: The Harvard Republican Club, Harvard Democrats, and Harvard College Conservation Society have offered joint support for a carbon dividends policy formulated by Harvard professors and alumni. Additionally, in one-on-one interactions, incoming students should expect to find peers who will appreciate the intellectual value of conservative arguments, even if they vehemently disagree politically.
Conservatives in college are often described by their absence or their presence, but truthfully that’s hardly relevant. There are conservatives on every campus. You’ll find them if you know where to look, but they’ll also find you if you’re vocal. Don’t be afraid to be vocal. They’ll come up to you after section to tell you they agree, even though they stayed quiet, or to thank you for saying what they were thinking. Being a conservative at Harvard is about balance. It’s the decision to raise your hand in section to argue the opposite point when there has been zero disagreement between classmates and teaching fellows alike. It’s feeling like an outsider when positions are stated with which everyone, except you, agrees. It’s finding the courage to use your voice while knowing people will not always like you for it. It’s also discovering students here at Harvard who are willing to listen and learn, even if in the end they still disagree.
To newly admitted conservative students, here’s what my two years on campus have taught me: Your views will be challenged, and you will gain so much more from your time here because of it. Use these challenges to hone your arguments and to learn to defend your positions with evidence. Don’t try to score a cheap win by assuming someone is less informed than you, because on this campus, they almost certainly are not. Incredible individuals, some of whom you’ll agree with, and some of whom you won’t, are all around you here—learn from all of them. And most importantly, don’t be afraid to speak up.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Friday night, the Cambridge Police Department arrested a black undergraduate on Massachusetts Avenue just outside the Law School. The incident has drawn national attention as Harvard affiliates and onlookers nationwide question whether the arrest and the proceedings leading up to the arrest were in accordance with University and Cambridge city protocol.
Those who have witnessed or watched video of the arrest have seen what can only be described as a case of police brutality.
It bears repeating: Last Friday night, four police officers attacked an unarmed, naked, black young man. The officers not only initiated physical interaction with the student but also caused injury to his body. One of the officers punched the student at least five times in the stomach while he was on the ground. Blood was found on the pavement, witnesses reported.
Like Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern and University President Drew G. Faust, we find the sequence of events “disturbing.” While the CPD has argued that the exertion of force was necessary to put the student, who had likely ingested narcotics, in handcuffs, we stand with the Black Law Students Association and others in strongly criticizing the arrest. It does not take an expert in policing to understand that there is a difference between restraining someone and punching them.
Beyond the Harvard and Cambridge communities, this disturbing instance of excessive force has garnered a fair amount of national attention, likely in large part due to the fact that the young man was a student at one of the nation’s premier educational institutions. The public reaction, in the face of national conversations on the violent policing of black communities, makes sense and is extremely warranted. We, of course, must ask that Harvard College students—especially black Harvard students—feel safe and supported by the people sworn to protect them. But our privileges should not be prerequisites for our safety and fair treatment.
We, as Harvard students, should not lose sight of the fact that this is nationwide phenomenon just because it has hit so close to home. We should care about the wellbeing of someone in our community, but we should also avoid falling into the trap of only calling for justice in this instance because he is our classmate.
Police brutality and excessive force reflect a profoundly unjust criminal justice system. In this moment of extreme emotional distress, anger, and motivation for change—we must ensure our responses consider the way anti-blackness and privilege play out nationally. We must advocate for the communities that Eric Garner, Stephon Clark, Philando Castile, and others were a part of as well, not just our own.
In the aftermath of this troubling event, we call on Harvard to do everything it can to defend the student’s legal rights and rights as a student and are grateful for the work of the Law School professors, Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. and Dehlia Umunna, who will represent him. We encourage all Harvard community members, particularly students, to call upon the University to condemn the police brutality and the system that continues to support this behavior both in this specific case and as perpetuated on a national scale. Finally, per his lawyers’ request, we believe it is critically important for the University and for the media to respect the privacy of the student.
While doing so, our campus community ought to reflect on the work we still have to do to make people of color feel safe and welcome in our community and country.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In just about every field, wanting to become elite is a noble goal. We also want to see elites in just about every field. We want to marvel at the feats of elite athletes. We want to entrust our lives to elite soldiers, elite pilots, and elite lawyers.
Yet in government, elites seem increasingly unwanted. President Donald Trump has come to power by waging a war against elites. Elite institutions like this one, which disproportionately produce the leaders in Washington, D.C., are now facing backlash for supposedly leading students to believe their own superiority and doing little else.
Resentment of elites in government is particularly counterintuitive because the stakes are higher in this field than in any other. For example, the world would not be too badly affected if all professional sports leagues were dissolved, or if the Olympics were restricted to true amateurs. But political leaders are literally our rulers. The policies that they champion affect everyday aspects of our lives, dictate broad societal features like economic mobility, and determine our country’s standing in the world. They bear responsibilities ranging from idealistic moral ones like serving the people to literal life-or-death situations.
One may not need an education at a so-called elite institution to gain the skills necessary for good governing. Even so, the average American would not be a good president. Furthermore, I imagine that the average American would not even want to be president, given the responsibilities and pressure. So why, when it is obvious that most of us could not do the job and that we should not entrust our government to just anyone, has “elite” become such a dirty word in politics?
A popular target for blame is the “liberal elite.” I understand that Democratic leaders have let down many Americans in recent years. They embraced multinational trade agreements and economic globalization but downplayed the negative side effects that devastated the working class. Then they bailed out big banks, which suggested to the public that they cared more about the finances of other elites than those of ordinary Americans. Now they disparage cultural values different than their own without acknowledging that not everyone has, or should have, the same values and American Dream as them.
But too often, the phrase “liberal elite” is used to encompass all the people who fall under the first adjective, instead of to focus on the fraction of people who also satisfy the second. There is nothing inherently elitist about being liberal. And surely the word “elite” loses meaning when it is applied to half the country.
Furthermore, there is a double standard when it comes to blaming elites. For all his talk, Trump is himself a member of the moneyed, corporate elite, and has filled his cabinet with similar figures—including two billionaires, twelve or more millionaires, and five Goldman Sachs alums. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this administration’s signature policies, the new tax plan and health care reform, are both predicted to hurt working- and middle-class Americans. Yet even though these elites surely do not care about the average American very much, they do not incur the same wrath from those who attack the “liberal elite.”
The real problem then does not lie within the “elite” as a concept, but with our inconsistent usage of the label. It is considered a plus for people whose success we admire, and an insult to those we don’t.
But based on its objective definition, we should want the “elite” to hold political power. We should even want them to be a little elitist. Unbridled elitism is insufferable, but success in politics requires a healthy dose of it. Since policies can be evaluated in so many ways, politicians cannot fully rely objective metrics to prove their worth. They must convince us through subjective means. To do so, they first must believe that they are superior and that they deserve more than anyone else to govern. But unlike in other fields where elites are determined through objective metrics, in politics we the people play more of a role in determining them. We should take this responsibility more seriously. Until we stop selectively using the word “elite” to disparage the people we don’t like and start holding everyone who vies for power to a higher standard, we will not produce the kinds of “elites” that deserve the label.

In anticipation of the fall 2020 expansion of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences to Allston, Dean of SEAS Francis J. Doyle III said his faculty are preparing a number of collaborative initiatives with their neighbor-to-be, Harvard Business School.
In a March interview, Doyle said SEAS has been working to launch initiatives in advance of the move, rather than waiting until the transition is over.
“We've got a bunch of initiatives that are anticipating how much more convenient and optimal and efficient it's going to be when we're in Allston, but we don't want to wait until that point,” he said. “We want to have those things running now, maybe work out a few of those kinks, and then we move over in 2020, those things can really accelerate.”
Doyle said one of those initiatives is the joint MS/MBA degree, announced in June 2017, whose courses will be jointly taught by SEAS and HBS faculty. The program is designed to “provide a strong foundation in general management, build design skills, and extend students’ understanding of engineering,” according to a press release. Its first cohort will matriculate in August 2018.
SEAS also recently launched a certificate program in Business Analytics, and its first cohort started in March. The program is a joint venture between SEAS, HBS, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Statistics Department, and 2U Inc., a company that specializes in online degree programs. The nine-month program features online seminars and two “on-campus learning experiences” at HBS, according to a press release.
Doyle said the certificate program’s curriculum is collaborative in nature, teaching concepts from data science, marketing, programming, and databases.
“It's pulled our faculty together to teach,” he said. “Both deans, Dean Nohria and myself, were saying how it’s so exciting to watch our faculty come together who have never taught together before, and are team teaching, and are doing very innovative things across these schools.”
Doyle said this kind of collaboration between schools will likely increase further after the 2020 expansion. He also said he thinks these types of collaborative programs may expand to include more schools across the University.
“These units that they're putting together for the online course are going to find relevance here in the courses that we teach in the College, at the Business School, with the graduate students,” he said. “This is pedagogically leading to some innovations that I think are going to have direct impact on the residential students.”

Correction: July 8, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that SEAS and HBS' certificate program in Business Analytics is an eight week-long program. In fact, the program usually requires nine months to complete.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of Harvard Law School students recently wrote an open letter calling for the school to ensure that law firms who recruit on campus “protect the rights of their employees” to come forward and seek legal action if they “experience harassment, discrimination, or workplace abuse.”
The letter stated that several law firms that recruit summer associates from the Law School have recently begun requiring new hires to sign mandatory arbitration agreements along with non-disclosure agreements.
Further, the letter said these agreements “cover all employment-related claims between the employee and the firm,” which include complaints of both sexual harassment and discrimination that are prohibited by Title VII and other civil rights legislation.
Students laid out specific policy changes they would like to see the Law School implement. For one, they want the Office of Career Services to require employers who recruit on campus to remove the mandatory arbitration and non-disclosure agreements from their contracts.
The letter also calls for the Law School to create and distribute “an anonymous workplace climate survey” for students who return from summer employment.
Attached to the open letter is a petition that has garnered 281 signatures at the time of publication. The petition lists a goal of 300 signatures.
Molly M. E. Coleman, one of the letter’s organizers, said in an interview Thursday that the issues were first raised by a lecturer at the Law School who found out firms were asking students to sign these agreements.
“Ian Samuel, who was a lecturer at the Law School, broke the news that Munger Tolles, which is a major law firm based out of L.A., was asking their summer associates to sign mandatory arbitration agreements,” Coleman said.
Coleman said they realized this was not an isolated incident, and their “serious concerns” about the impact of the agreements led a group of students to organize on the issue.
“It became clear that there were a number of law firms that were asking their employees to sign these agreements,” Coleman said. “We don’t know how many at this point, nobody knows.”
Sejal Singh, another organizer of the letter, pointed to the particular salience of law firms requiring summer associates to sign mandatory arbitration and non-disclosure agreements in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which sparked national conversations about workplace harassment.
“The fact that this happened right after #MeToo is a signal to us that this is a way that firms are trying to cover up sexual harassment,” Singh said.
Singh said he and other students are working with other top law schools to address this issue.
“We’ve been working with students at Georgetown, Berkeley, NYU, and many other peer institutions,” Singh said.
Coleman also said students have had productive conversations with Law School administrators, including Assistant Dean for Career Services Mark A. Weber, to try to move forward with their proposed changes.
“I’ve been pretty active in ongoing conversations with a number of different people in the administration. We met with Mark Weber… and that was a very positive, productive conversation,” Coleman said. “I think it’s going to take some time. We’re hopeful that we’ll be able to see a little bit more movement in the next two weeks, essentially before students head to firms for the summer.”
Weber wrote in an emailed statement that he has met with students who are concerned about these agreements and is working to resolve the issue.
“I understand their concerns, and we take them very seriously. We are examining how to address the issue in our recruiting efforts,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 20, 2018 at 6:30 a.m.
Alex Ross ’90 delivered this year’s Louis C. Elson Lecture entitled “Wagner, Hitler, and the Cult of Art” at the John Knowles Paine Concert Hall Thursday evening.
Established in 1944 by Bertha A. Elson in memory of her late composer husband, the annual lecture—which is sponsored by the Department of Music—has invited lecturers ranging from Yo-Yo Ma ’76 to Laurie Anderson in past years.
A former English concentrator, Ross is now a classical music critic at the New Yorker, where he began writing shortly after graduating summa cum laude from the College in 1990. During his time at Harvard, Ross was a classical music disc jockey at the WHRB radio station.
Suzannah E. Clark, the chair of the Department of Music, introduced Ross prior to the lecture.
“What makes [Ross] unique as a critic is that he seeks out music along the full spectrum of venues,” she said. “He is a preeminent voice in the world of music.”
During his lecture, Ross focused on the cultural and political role German classical composer W. Richard Wagner played in the Nazi regime, and the legacy of Nazi Wagnerism in subsequent decades.
“This is a massive subject, because Wagner may be, for better or for worse, the most widely influential figure in the history of music,” Ross said.
“Of the Wagnerisms, the one with which people are most familiar is the ‘Nazi’ version. The single thing that the man or the woman in the street knows about Wagner is that he was Hitler’s favorite composer,” Ross said.
Ross added that he believes despite the common associations between Wagner’s work and Nazism, Wagner’s historical place in Nazi culture and the “pantheon of high art” was much less secure.
“My aim...is to find a way of envisioning Wagner’s influence without falling prey to this kind of teleological, goal-directed thinking, and to restore, in some way, the complexity and contingency of this history and recapture the majestic confusion once meant to be Wagnerian,” Ross said.
Ross pointed out several differences between Wagner and Adolf Hitler, whom Wagner is thought to have deeply influenced.
“Wagner was a vicious anti-Semite, but anti-Semitism in itself is not a political program. Nor is Wagner’s anti-Semitism the same as Hitler’s. Although he helped to popularize biological racism, he never completed the transition from religious anti-Semitism to scientific anti-Semitism,” Ross said.
Ross acknowledged that “Hitler’s literacy as a Wagnerian assisted his rise,” especially among wealthier individuals and groups at the time. One such individual was Ernst F. Hanfstaengl, Class of 1909, with whom Hitler “formed a crucial bond.” Hanfstaengl played Wagner’s “Die Meistersinger” for Hitler, who, according to Ross, was delighted.
“When he visited Harvard for his 25th anniversary in 1934, the editors of The Crimson said [Hanfstaengl] should be awarded an honorary degree,” Ross said.
In addition to mentioning Wagner’s influence on Leni Riefenstahl’s “Triumph of the Will,” Ross discussed his influence on American films ranging from D.W. Griffith’s “Birth of a Nation” to Francis Ford Coppola’s “Apocalypse Now.”
“Although that I personally feel that Wagner’s responsibility [for Nazism] has been greatly overstated...I am not trying to wag my finger and say it’s wrong," Ross said. "In any case, there is no dislodging the association. Instead, I’m inclined to think about how the cult of art resonates in our own time and how we might learn from its persistence."
Ryan Zhang ’21 attended the event and was impressed by Ross’s “very nuanced thesis that Wagner during the Nazi era wasn’t as widely popular as his legacy makes him out to be.”
“When we think of Wagner in Nazi Germany, we think that everyone loved Wagner, but it’s interesting how Wagner, even then, was mainly a tool for the upper echelons of the party,” Zhang said.

CORRECTION: April 20, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that the Elson Lecture was established in 1994. In fact, the lecture was established in 1944.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A number of student athletes on Harvard’s 42 varsity teams have taken on another role this year: Chief Marketing Officer.
In Sept. 2017 the Athletics Department announced a new student marketing program in which an athlete from each team would work with the marketing department in Athletics to increase communication between student athletes and the department.
In the two semesters since the program was announced, CMOs have assisted the marketing department in tailoring promotional content and featured events to their individual teams and increasing student engagement in athletics.
Grace C. Eysenbach 20’, one of two CMOs for women’s heavyweight crew, said she helped the marketing department draw more students to her team’s events.
“They talk to us about what makes the most sense—like in terms of rowing, where people would like to watch it, what kinds of things would get people to come,” Eysenbach said. “I think it’s really important to get feedback from the actual athletes because we know which teams, which games are going to be competitive and fun to watch.”
Associate Director of Athletics Susan Byrne wrote in an email that the CMOs have increased student attendance at sporting events. Byrne cited an initiative to better publicize track and field events, led by team CMO Randy R. Raymond ’18, as an example of a successful collaboration with the CMOs.
“His goal was to attract more fans through personal invitations and identify specific start times for the events since these aren't readily publicized,” Byrne wrote. “It worked since 91 students checked in on the student rewards app!”
Byrne also wrote that the CMOs have been helping the Athletics Department step up its social media presence, especially on Instagram.
“Based on feedback from the CMOs, most of their peers are active Instagram users,” Byrne wrote. “According to the data showing our interactions and reach, the Instagram stories are helping engagement and reaching our target audience.”
Though many of the CMOs have worked closely with the marketing department over the course of the year, some students have worked more closely with their teams to create team-specific projects.
Baseball player Hunter B. Bigge ’20 arranged for his team to send 100 thank you letters to former players. Bigge said the project was part of a larger goal to increase connections between current players and alumni.
“I’ve been thinking we should do more alumni outreach since I got here, and so when I saw, when I took this position I thought that was the first thing I wanted to do,” Bigge said. “I think something coming from the players, that’s a more personal touch and will make the alums feel more connected to the program.”
Many student-athletes took on the role of CMO on top of already busy schedules. The CMOs agreed, though, that the role has not required a major time commitment. Bigge said the self-driven nature of the role allows him to work on his CMO projects in his free time.
“I’ve been to three meetings for it this year, probably less than three hours total,” Bigge said. “It’s a pretty laid back position and whenever I think of ideas, I’ll literally just shoot the team an email and see if people like it or not—and if they like  it, then try to move forward with it.”
Ski team CMO Allegra B. Colman ’21 said she wasn’t quite sure what she was signing up for when she volunteered to be her team’s CMO at the beginning of the year, but she said she has enjoyed her job.
“It was kind of just like a random job,” Colman said. “At the beginning of the season the coach was like who wants to do this, I raised my hand, and it was something I really got invested in and I really enjoy doing.”
As the end of the student athlete marketing program’s first year approaches, Byrne wrote that her department is looking forward to building off of the momentum that this year’s CMOs have created.
“We developed a strong foundation this year, and we look forward to building on that foundation in the future,” Byrne wrote. “We are creating a survey for the CMO’s to help us evaluate the first year and see what changes we want to implement next year.”
While it is up to the teams to decide who will be CMO next year, a number of the CMOs said they are hopeful they can continue in their role.
“It will be hard parting with the chief marketing officer position,” Bigge said. “I probably want to keep doing it for the next three years unless a freshman comes in and they’re just chief marketing officer material and then we’ll see.”

Beginning next year, one entryway in Adams House will be focused specifically on student wellness, according to Adams House Faculty Deans John G. “Sean” Palfrey ‘67 and Judith S. “Judy” Palfrey ‘67 and Resident Dean Adam Muri-Rosenthal.
In an email sent to the Adams community last week, the Adams House administrators announced a new initiative which will designate I-Entryway—located in Randolph Hall next to Linden Street—a “wellness entryway” where students will meet throughout the year to set community expectations and discuss ways to live happy and healthy lives.
“We believe that this will provide an opportunity for students living in the entryway to be intentional about their choices, collectively set the norms for their micro-community, and be supportive to one another in upholding them,” they wrote.
In addition to prompting students to be thoughtful about their living choices, this new initiative also seeks to foster house spirit, Muri-Rosenthal wrote in an email.
“We hope that uniting students locally around a specific theme will bestow a common mission, strengthen bonds among students, and eventually provide a model for building community throughout the House,” he wrote.
In their email to Adams House residents, the administrators wrote they chose I-Entryway, one of the smallest entryways in Adams House, for the wellness entryway experiment in order to move forward with “minimal impact to the community at large.” I-Entryway also houses the community kitchen and the technology-free Heaney Suite, named for former Poet-in-Residence Seamus Heaney, who frequently stayed in Adams.
Per the results of the Adams housing lottery, only two upperclassmen—out of the approximately 300 juniors and seniors in the lottery—will live in the newly-designated wellness entryway next year. Sophomores, who do not typically pick their room assignments, will fill the remaining rooms in the entryway.
Adams House will begin a three-year renovation in June 2019, overlapping briefly with the ongoing renovation of Lowell House, which is scheduled to end in Aug. 2019.
The Adams renovation will be the first to proceed in stages, with the House’s different residential halls set to be restored at different times. Claverly Hall will be the first to be renovated, from June 2019 to July 2020, according to Elizabeth R. Leber, a partner at architectural firm Beyer Blinder Belle. Apthorp House and Randolph Hall, home to the new wellness entryway, will be restored in the following year, with Russell Hall and Westmorly Court undergoing renovation last.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Almost a week after the arrest of a Harvard student led to allegations of police brutality, three police chiefs from Detroit, San Francisco, and Minneapolis visited the Harvard Kennedy School Thursday to field questions about the realities of modern-day policing.
Professor Robert W. Livingston, a lecturer of public policy at the Kennedy School, moderated the event, which was planned before the arrest occurred. The police chiefs also visited Livingston’s classroom and attended a dinner with students while on campus.
Livingston opened the event by informing students, faculty, and staff present that the chiefs had already seen video footage, released by the New York Times, capturing the arrest of a naked and unarmed black College student Friday by at least three Cambridge Police Officers and one Transit Police Department officer. The student was allegedly under the influence of narcotics at the time.
The video shows the officers standing around the student as they attempt to speak to him. After the student turns and takes two steps towards one officer and a step back and raises his arms to mid-chest level, an officer standing behind the student tackles him to the ground. A later CPD police report states the student was making aggressive moves toward law enforcement; eyewitnesses including members of the Harvard Black Law Students Association have stated the officers acted "without provocation."
While the student remained on the ground, at least one CPD officer punched the undergraduate in the stomach five times in an "ineffective" attempt to unpin the student’s arms and handcuff him, according to a CPD police report.
Members of BLSA have called the incident an instance of police brutality, and Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern and Harvard University President Drew G. Faust later dubbed the incident “disturbing.”
Since the incident, the Cambridge Police Department announced it will conduct an  “internal review” of the arrest; per CPD policy, the department conducts such a review any time its officers use force.
Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf released a statement Monday emphasizing that school administrators are “here to support” those at the school affected by the incident. Students have since said they are concerned by what they called the dean’s delay in sending the email as well as the missive's nonspecific language; the email did not identify the student as black.
At the event Thursday, San Francisco Police Chief William “Bill” Scott said he did not want to pass judgment on the recent incident in Cambridge, but he referred to legislation under discussion in California that would heighten the standards for when the police can open fire. The current law asserts police can open fire "when reasonable"; the legislation would alter that language to read "only when necessary."
Scott said he believes these policy changes are “born of frustration from the American public” and must be done “thoughtfully.”
“I think we do have to change things, but until you see those changes, I don’t think that we can invent the law as we go haphazardly, so it’s going to take some thoughtful changes in the law to change the way we do things,” Scott said.
When asked how police officers decide a situation is dangerous enough to merit use of force, especially when the officers are dealing with individuals who have mental illnesses or disabilities, Minneapolis Chief of Police Medaria Arradondo stressed the importance of community outreach as a way to gain a better understanding of how officers need to respond to potential incidents.
“We are looking into ways in our community where we can have very intentional and thoughtful trainings to help in those areas,” Arradondo said.
Students also asked the police chiefs to discuss the use of violence evident in the video of the Harvard student’s arrest.
Arradondo said police culture “had evolved” and that, in the past, the presence of more than one officer responding to a single citizen would have been “laughable.” Now, though, he said it is not “unusual” to bring up to four or five officers to a single call.
“The optics look bad but the goal is to keep the officer and community member from harm,” Arradondo said.
Detroit Chief of Police James E. Craig said it would be difficult for him to form an opinion on the incident but that “televised force incidents” never look good.
Livingston said the Kennedy School is “supportive” of having more events centered around policing in America, especially as young people across the country lead movements against police violence.
“We've seen in broader national demonstrations that younger people are demanding greater safety and greater accountability, both for the cops and the criminals,” Livingston said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students have formed a new all-female final club called the Exister Society, according to an email sent to some undergraduates Wednesday night and obtained by The Crimson.
The group is partnering with the mobile dating app Bumble to host a party April 23, according to the email.
The club—nicknamed the “X”—is hosting the party at a club in Central Square, per the email. The party is titled "Parental Advisory Explicit Content."
The X, which was founded in fall 2017, is currently all-female, according to X President Eliza Alston ’19.
The club’s formation came some time before the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—voted in Dec. 2017 to officially approve the College’s policy sanctioning members of unrecognized single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations.
The social group policy, which took effect with the Class of 2021, bars members of single-gender social groups from holding campus leadership positions, serving as captains of varsity athletic teams, or receiving College endorsement for prestigious post-graduate fellowships.
Madeleine L. Lapuerta ’20, campus director at Harvard for Bumble, said in an interview Sunday that her job is to seek partnerships to “spread word around” about the dating app. She added that the X’s party serves as a way to “promote Bumble.”
“My whole role in this was literally just to find an opportunity for Bumble to get out there more on campus, and I thought that a final club party was a great way to do that,” Lapuerta said.
Both Alston and Lapuerta did not comment on the specific nature of the partnership between the X and Bumble.

Michael P. Botticelli and John P. Walters, former directors of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, warned a crowd of more than 50 law students that greater urgency is required to combat the opioid epidemic.
Thursday afternoon’s talk marked the conclusion of The Opioid Crisis and the Law, a four-part series held over the past two months at the Law School. The series launched on March 1 with a panel of state and local policymakers who spoke about their experiences dealing with the current epidemic. The event also included two talks on the judiciary’s response to the epidemic and racial dimensions of the opioid crisis.
Edward Delman, the organizer of the series, said he hoped to draw Law students' attention to the pressing and complex issue.
“One of my main hopes in bringing this conversation to campus was to open people’s eyes to what is going on around the country,” he said. “It’s such a multi-faceted crisis. It’s a criminal issue, it’s a public health issue, it’s a structural issue, it’s a legislative issue. It encompasses all branches of government and so many different sectors.”
The American Constitution Society of Harvard Law School, the HLS Democrats, the HLS Republicans, and the Harvard Health Law Society co-hosted Thursday's talk.
Despite being divided along party lines—Botticelli served under Barack Obama and Walters served under George W. Bush—the two former drug czars said they agreed on a great deal when it comes to combating such a serious national epidemic.
“We both come here with the spirit of bipartisanship,” Botticelli said.
Both men said they were alarmed by the unmitigated crisis and the lack of urgency with which it is being addressed.
Walters said policy makers should consider the opioid epidemic as an instance of mass poisoning.
“We are losing over 60,000 people a year. That’s an old number because it’s been growing at 20 percent a year and that’s a 2016 number,” Walters said. “We are turning our back on tens of thousands of people every year.”
In the course of the talk, Walters and Botticelli proposed various steps federal and state governments should take next to combat the epidemic, like measures to improve treatment for victims and counteract stigma.
“Epidemics don’t come out of a vacuum. There were significant environmental conditions that existed prior to the environmental,” Botticelli said.

Many finance and consulting firms are completing their recruitment processes earlier in the fall—and targeting younger students—to grasp talent before other organizations.
The large proportion of Harvard students that pursue these careers are seeing the effects of the timeline changes, according to Office of Career Services Director Robin Mount.
Based on OCS’s 2017 senior survey data, about a quarter of graduating seniors in 2017 planned to go into finance or consulting. That breaks down to about 12 percent entering consulting and about 13 percent entering financial services—and the numbers are increasing, according to Mount.
Mount added that because the applicant pool for these positions is growing, more firms are coming to Harvard. And, in turn, because of this competition, many of the firms are looking to recruit students earlier.
Max R.D. Krawitz '21 is an associate for the Harvard College Consulting Group—an undergraduate organization that consults for various organizations—and said he has attended various informal events with consulting firms, like coffee chats. He said that as a freshman, he found these events helpful since they are relatively low stress, help students gain some interview experience, and “make the process less intimidating.”
Various firms—including Goldman Sachs, McKinsey and Company, and Boston Consulting Group—target underclassmen through formal and informal meet-ups on campus, like office hours, dinners, and coffee chats.
Some, though, have taken a more personal approach. Deloitte, for instance, has an Early Mentorship Program for Harvard freshmen and sophomores who are unsure of their paths to consulting.
Michael C. Reid ‘18 said that when he was a freshman, there were not many known opportunities for involvement in consulting, and there were many misconceptions about people in the sector.
“There was this preconceived idea of what the industry actually is,” Reid said. “When I came onto campus as a freshman, they would lump you into this group of people that everybody hates that nobody really understood what it actually meant to consult.”
This semester, Reid co-founded the Crimson Consulting Club, an organization that consults for other Harvard student organizations.
Reid said that, in addition to the benefits to shifting the schedule earlier in the fall, there are benefits to recruiting students at a younger age. He said these changing schedules can make students focus more on their lives after Harvard at an earlier stage, which he said is not typical as many students get caught in the Harvard bubble.
“A lot of times people get caught into the Harvard bubble and don’t think about what they’re doing after. One of the main benefits from moving the timeline a bit forward is, now, a freshman can come in and know that there are different job opportunities,” he said.
Mount, however, said she worries that the earlier recruiting schedule favors students who come into college knowing they want to go in to consulting, which would likely come from the privilege of having someone close to them who can inform them about the sector.
She mentioned a situation in 2014 when Facebook hired a paid summer intern who was a high school student. Facebook flew the student and his mother out to California for the interview. Though this happened in a tech company, Mount said she worries that this is trend extends to other types of firms.
Mount said different sectors have varying entry points. Some finance firms, for example, will mostly hire from an intern class. So, if you miss an initial opening, your chances for future involvement are extremely reduced. Mount said she also worries this will decrease the diversity of students that are hired.
“How much earlier can you go? A big concern we have is that it definitely privileges students who arrive on campus knowing that they have an interest in that, which means that they probably have family members or family friends,” she said. “Who knows about any of these things in high school?”

Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, award winning author of “Purple Hibiscus,” “Half of a Yellow Sun,” and “Americanah” will address the College’s Class of 2018 at Class Day, the speaker selection committee announced Thursday.
Adichie, a Nigerian-born writer, has published several critically acclaimed novels and short-stories. Her work has been published in the New Yorker, Granta, the O. Henry Prize Stories, and the Financial Times, and her work has been translated into more than 30 languages. Adichie’s novel, “Americanah,” was named one of the New York Times Top Ten Best Books of 2013.
She is also no stranger to Harvard, having completed a fellowship at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. Along with her writing career, she is the co-founder of Farafina Trust, a nonprofit that advocates for engagement with society through reading and writing. In 2008, she was awarded a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 2008.
Berkeley E. Brown ’18, first marshal of the Senior Class Committee, said the speaker selection committee was grateful to have Adichie as their Class Day speaker in an interview with the University-run Harvard Gazette.
“We are honored to welcome Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie as our Class Day speaker. Her eloquence and perspective as a writer and public speaker have inspired audiences to look beyond stereotypes and social norms to recognize our common humanity,” Brown said.
The Senior Class Committee has invited a guest speaker every year since 1968; the first was Martin Luther King Jr., who accepted the invitation shortly before his assassination. His wife, Coretta Scott King, then delivered the speech in his honor, becoming the first woman to give a Class Day speech at Harvard. Adichie will address graduating students 50 years after Coretta Scott King spoke as Harvard’s Class Day speaker.
Adichie has also given two notable TED talks: “The Danger of a Single Story” in 2009, and, in 2012, “We Should All Be Feminists.” The latter address sparked a global conversation on the importance of feminism and was published as a book in 2014.
Jerry G. Nelluvelil ’18, a senior class marshal and co-chair of the speaker selection committee, said in an interview with the Gazette that Adichie’s TED talks conveyed messages important for the class to hear.
“In her captivating TED talks, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie urges us to better understand one another’s stories and to plan for ‘a world of happier men and happier women who are truer to themselves.’ This is a powerful message for our class to hear as we reflect on our time at Harvard and prepare to write the next chapter of our stories,” Nelluvelil said .
Adichie will address the Class of 2018 on May 23, one day before the Harvard’s 367th Commencement ceremony. Earlier last month, the University announced that U.S. congressman and civil rights leader John R. Lewis will be the Commencement speaker.

A University-wide report tracking the growth of faculty gender and racial diversity across Harvard’s individual schools found that some schools—like the Law School and the Graduate School of Education—have seen growth in the number of women and minorities on their faculties, while others—like the Graduate School of Design and Harvard Kennedy School—have made little to no progress in diversification over the past decade.
The Faculty Diversity and Development report, compiled annually by Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity Judith D. Singer, contains statistics on the number of ladder faculty—meaning tenured professors and those on the tenure track like assistant and associate professors—who are women or minorities within FAS and the University’s professional schools. The report, released earlier this month, also details initiatives each school is undertaking in order to diversify its faculty.
Women make up 30 percent of the University’s ladder faculty, according to the report. Within that statistic, 27 percent of tenured faculty and 40 percent of tenure-track faculty are women this year. Over the last decade, female tenure-track faculty and tenured faculty have grown by three and six percentage points, respectively.
The report measures Asian faculty and underrepresented minority faculty separately. Across the University, 23 percent of ladder faculty are minorities. Within that group, 8 percent of tenured faculty are underrepresented minorities and 11 percent are Asian. Eleven percent of tenure-track faculty are underrepresented minorities and 21 percent are Asian.
Since 2008, the percentage of overall minority faculty has grown to just above 20 percent. Asian tenure-track faculty and tenured faculty have grown by four and three percentage points, respectively. Underrepresented minorities have grown by one and three percentage points, respectively.
“Progress is slow, slower than I would like… Changing the faculty is actually a long game. It's not a short game,” Singer said.
Faculty diversification, however, is a hot topic on the University’s agenda. The Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging—convened by University President Drew G. Faust in May 2016—recommended the University bolster its efforts to recruit and support a more diverse faculty base in its final report released last month. 
“Increasing the diversity of the Harvard faculty is front and center on the minds of all university leadership,” Singer, who was also a member of the task force, said.
Singer said she has had conversations with Faust, President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow, and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 surrounding the topic of faculty diversification. In response to the task force report, Faust announced she is allocating $10 million worth of presidential funds to new faculty hires last month.
But Singer said Harvard isn't the only university looking to diversify its faculty—all of its peers are aiming to do the same and may look to Harvard as a source of promising prospects.
“Every other institution is trying to diversify their faculty. One of the best ways to diversify your faculty if you are one of our peer institutions is to look at who we have,” she said. “So on the other hand, we also have to make sure that it is possible for our tenure-track faculty to succeed here.”
Singer said the University has kick-started several initiatives to improve “quality of life” for faculty. Among these is encouraging all schools to move to a tenure-track. According to Singer, the last school to do so was the GSD, which will begin its tenure-track program in the fall; at that point, all of the University’s schools will have moved to a tenure-track. In the absence of a tenure-track, the University offered less support for career advancement to younger academics and relied more on professors that had already gained tenure at another institution to fill positions.
The University has also committed to constructing a new childcare center in Allston, adding to its six current centers. It reserves half of the slots in Harvard-affiliated child care centers for faculty and recently raised the income cap for subsidies for childcare, according to Singer.
“This year, for the first time, in anyone’s memory, every faculty member who applied for a slot got a slot,” Singer said. “We are optimistic that we are on track this year and that we’ve solved the access problem into these centers as well.”
Despite these University-wide initiatives, Singer noted that the responsibility of hiring faculty does not fall on the University’s central administration. Individual schools must take initiative in changing the composition of their faculty, which has been historically white and male.
“It takes more than just edicts from the center to change what happens in the individual schools,” Singer said.
Faculty demographics, therefore, are different among schools and they have varying rates of  diversity growth. While the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has just reached gender parity in the sciences tenure track, for example, other schools still struggle to recruit female as well as minority faculty.
“The main driver of the differences across the schools is the distribution of women and minority scholars into fields,” Singer said.
Singer, who called the achievement of gender parity in the FAS sciences division one of the “bright spots” of the report, also pointed to the Ed School’s gender parity in tenure-track and tenured faculty. However, she called the latter example “not terribly surprising,” given that the number of people pursuing doctorates in education are mostly women.
Overall, in Harvard’s professional schools, 38 percent of tenure-track faculty—up two percentage points from 2008—are female, according to the report. Twenty-six percent of tenured faculty are female—an increase of seven percentage points from 2008.
Some schools have seen faster growth rates than others. The Law School reported that 67 percent of tenure-track faculty are female, which is 10 percentage points higher than in 2008. The schools’  growth in tenured female faculty is up 7 percentage points from 17 percent in 2008 to 24 percent in 2018.
The report highlighted the Law School’s programs for supporting students and graduates who want to pursue careers in academia, such as a summer academic fellowship program that pairs students and graduates with faculty to provide academic and financial support. The fellowship aims to “enable them to focus on producing publishable work in anticipation of entering the academic teaching market in a few years,” according to the report.
“This is the earliest point in the pipeline at which the Law School provides funding for future academics, and we are encouraged by the percentage of women and students of color in this program,” the report reads.
The Law School, however, reported that just 4 percent of tenured faculty are Asian and 11 percent are underrepresented minorities. Over the last 10 years, the Law School has not made significant growth in increasing the number of faculty in either of these categories.
The Kennedy School has achieved little to no growth in terms of female faculty, according to the report. HKS reported that 33 percent of tenure-track faculty are female, the same percentage as in 2008. Twenty-one percent of tenured faculty are female—up just one percentage point from 10 years prior.
The report states, however, that “nearly 40 percent of all newly tenured faculty members since 2004 have been women.”
The Kennedy School has also come under fire for its slow growth in minority faculty. Asians comprise 6 percent of tenure-track faculty and 14 percent of tenured faculty. Underrepresented minorities constitute 22 percent of tenure-track faculty and seven percent of tenured faculty. According to the report, just three African American professors have received tenure at the Kennedy School. The most recent award of tenure to a black professor at the school went to Khalil Gibran Muhammad in 2016, and, in recent years, three female faculty of color have left the institution.
“We have made less progress toward increasing the ethnic and racial diversity of our faculty, especially among tenured faculty, and must do better here,” the report reads, referring to the Kennedy School.
The Business School reported that 10 percent of tenure-track faculty and 7 percent of tenured faculty are underrepresented minorities. The school’s percentage of underrepresented minorities has only risen by two percentage points from 5 percent to 7 percent since 2008.
However, the Business School reported higher proportions of Asian faculty, with 24 percent tenure-track faculty and 22 percent tenured faculty identifying as Asian.
The Business School shows similar numbers to the Kennedy School in terms of gender diversity: This year, 35 percent of tenure-track faculty and 21 percent of tenured faculty are female. In terms of growth since 2008, though, the school has increased its numbers of female faculty at a more rapid rate than the Kennedy School.
“Faculty diversity continues to be an area of focus. In the 2016-17 season, HBS recruited 23 teaching faculty including 12 tenure-track faculty; 35% of teaching faculty hires are women,” the report reads, referring to the Business School.
While the Medical School has shown growth in female faculty, it has fallen behind other schools with regards to minority faculty recruitment and retention.
The Medical School reported that 34 percent of tenure-track and 23 percent of tenured faculty are female. The school’s percentage of tenured female faculty has grown steadily over the last decade, rising from 15 to 23 percent.
The report claims, however, that for minority faculty recruitment, the Medical School is “far from shifting the curve.”
According to the report, just 4 percent of tenured faculty are from underrepresented backgrounds—up just two percentage points from 2008. Similarly, only 6 percent of tenured faculty are Asian at the Medical School.
“Despite access to guidelines for all searches and engagement of the Dean’s office in senior searches, the outcomes fell short of our general goal of increasing gender and racial/ethnic diversity,” the report reads, referring to the Medical School.
In the School of Public Health, women represent 42 percent of tenure-track faculty and 31 percent of tenured faculty. Asians comprise 16 percent of the tenure-track and 17 percent of the tenured faculty, while underrepresented minorities comprise 13 percent of the tenure-track and eight percent of the tenured faculty.
The report highlighted the April 2017 appointment of Betty Johnson as the Assistant Dean for Faculty and Staff Diversity, Development, and Leadership at the School of Public Health. Johnson focused on developing and expanding initiatives to recruit more faculty from underrepresented minority backgrounds this year, according to the report.
The Divinity School has reached gender parity in the tenure-track. It is the closest among Harvard’s schools, other than the Ed School, to reach gender parity among tenured faculty, with 39 percent female tenured faculty.
The school, however, reports that there are no Asian faculty, which has been true for the last 10 years, according to the report. Twenty-one percent of the faculty are underrepresented minorities.
In July 2017, the Divinity School hired two professors in the area of African American Religions. The school also welcomed Cornel West as professor of the Practice of Public Philosophy in coordination with the FAS’ Department of African and African American Studies in spring 2017, according to the report.
The Graduate School of Design’s female tenure-track faculty is 37 percent, while tenured female faculty is 27 percent. The school has experienced a growth of three percentage points in female tenured faculty since 2008.
Growth in underrepresented minorities has not increased but instead fallen over the last ten years in the GSD from 10 to 8 percent in tenure-track faculty and 17 to 15 percent in tenured faculty. The growth in Asian faculty is upward trending with a increase from 0 to 24 percent in tenure-track faculty and 3 to 9 percent in tenured faculty.
Students at the school recently circulated an anonymous document that listed instances of sexual misconduct and racist acts among individuals in the architecture industry, including several members of the GSD’s faculty.
According to the report, there are ongoing searches at the GSD to fill senior positions in the Department of Architecture, Landscape Architecture, and Urban Planning.
“The search committees are actively seeking candidates with a diversity of cross-disciplinary interests and expertise, as well as encouraging applications that will increase the representation of women and minorities in the design faculty and support the larger goal of increasing representation in the design profession,” the report reads.
The practice of collecting data on faculty demographics in the annual report is key to improvement, Singer said. Her office is in the process of conducting its third faculty climate survey. The previous two surveys were distributed in 2008 and 2013, respectively. The collecting of data overlaps with recommendations in the diversity task force’s March report, which calls on Harvard’s central administration and individual schools to conduct more surveys measuring diversity at their institutions.
“Part of what we try to do is identify places we’re doing well and places where we need improvement, so I think data can be a powerful force,” Singer said.

UPDATED: April 20, 2018 at 4:32 p.m.
This article is part one of The Crimson’s five-part series analyzing exit polling data collected during Harvard’s 2018 unionization election. Read part two here, part three here, and part four here.
The results of the election that will decide whether Harvard teaching and research assistants unionize are too close to call, according to exit polling data collected by The Crimson.
Exit poll results adjusted for response bias suggest a slight majority—50.6 percent—of eligible students who cast ballots voted in favor of unionization. But the margin of error—plus or minus 2 percent—means The Crimson cannot be certain the election will result in unionization. The Crimson used a 95 percent confidence interval, the standard for election polling, to calculate the margin of error.
The final result will likely be decided Friday. National Labor Relations Board officials are set to tally the ballots in the NLRB’s regional office in downtown Boston starting 9:30 a.m. Friday.
The unionization election took place over the course of two days, April 18 and 19, at polling sites on segments of Harvard’s campus in Cambridge, Longwood, and Allston. At stake is whether more than 4,000 eligible graduate and undergraduate students will begin collectively bargaining with the University as members of Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers.
If the final results fall in favor of unionization, Harvard will join a small handful of private American university to see a union form without voluntarily granting the union recognition. Columbia University was the first.
The Crimson conducted exit polling of voters at all three voting stations on April 18 and 19, collecting 1,295 responses. A total of 5,046 Harvard affiliates were eligible to vote; it is not yet clear how many eligible voters chose to cast ballots.
Crimson reporters stationed outside voting sites handed voters 23-question surveys asking the students how they voted, various demographic questions, and their views on salient campus issues. At least one reporter stood outside every single site for 78 percent of all hours the sites remained open. The surveys were later electronically processed using open-source software.
Of survey respondents who answered a question asking whether they voted in Harvard’s previous unionization election, held Nov. 2016, 50.4 percent answered yes while 49.6 percent answered no. New voters were 17.4 percent more likely to vote in favor of unionization.
Of respondents who indicated they voted in the last election, 11.7 percent reported changing their minds since Nov. 2016. Of those who indicated they changed their minds, 78.8 percent said they voted in favor of unionization this time around.
The 2016 vote saw a final tally of 1,526 votes cast against against unionization and 1,396 cast in favor. Lawyers for HGSU-UAW challenged the results of that first election, ultimately sparking more than a year of legal battles between Harvard and the would-be union. The NLRB ultimately mandated in Jan. 2018 that the University must hold a second election.
[The Crimson maintained an online article constantly updated with voter interviews throughout the 2018 unionization election. Look back on the two historic days here.]
Of survey respondents who reported their gender, women were 14 percent more likely than men to vote in favor of unionization. Of survey respondents who reported their international status, international students were 9 percent less likely to vote in favor of unionization.
Out of all respondents who indicated how they voted, 68.9 percent voted in favor of unionization while 31.1 percent voted against. The Crimson adjusted this result for response bias (see below for methodology), leading to the conclusion a small majority of eligible students may have voted for the union.
Jae Hyeon Lee—a member of Against HGSU-UAW, a Facebook group for anti-union students—wrote in an email that, as someone who “has been vocally against unionization,” he is glad the election cycle has come to an end, regardless of result.
“Looking back, my engagement in this issue has been the most emotionally tiring and contentious chapter of my graduate career,” Jae wrote. “At times it was quite disheartening to see how divisive this issue has been among students.”
“Whatever the result may be, going forward I hope students from both sides can work together towards the common ideal of improving the student experience in a more dispassionate and positive manner,” he added.
HGSU-UAW organizer Andrew B. Donnelly said in an interview Thursday night he thinks the election ran smoothly overall.
“I’m proud of the positive, issues-based campaign we’ve run,” he said. “I’m excited for the count tomorrow.”

After reviewing raw exit poll data, The Crimson identified response bias suggesting that, overall, voters in favor of unionization were more likely to fill out the survey than were voters against unionization, leading to a 32 percent oversampling of pro-union votes.
The Crimson measured this bias by benchmarking data collected April 18 and 19 against results from the previous Nov. 2016 election. This analysis revealed that—of respondents who indicated they voted in both elections—the percentage of respondents who indicated they voted yes in both elections was higher than the actual percentage of voters who voted yes to unionization in 2016.
The Crimson corrected for this apparent pro-unionization skewing by dividing the percentage of respondents who indicated they voted for unionization in 2018 by the increased likelihood that a respondent who favors unionization would fill out the survey.
The Crimson also corrected for possible geographic biases, given the NLRB assigned each eligible voter in the 2018 election to one of the three sites before polling began. This correction was necessary because it is possible the geographic distribution of survey respondents did not match the geographic distribution of actual voters.
Of total survey respondents, 80.6 percent voted in Cambridge, 18.1 percent voted in Longwood, and 1.3 percent voted in Allston. Of total eligible voters, approximately 3,644 voters—or 72.9 percent—were assigned to the Cambridge site, 1,293—or 25.9 percent—were assigned to the Longwood site, and 59—or 1.2 percent—were assigned to the Allston site.
The Crimson applied a geographic bias correction by taking the recorded vote breakdown from each polling site and applying a weight proportional to the total eligible population assigned to that site. In making this calculation, The Crimson assumed there was no statistically significant difference in voter turnout between the three different sites.
Voters could choose to vote in a site other than their NLRB-assigned location—but if a voter chose to do so, that voter had to cast their ballot “under challenge,” meaning the NLRB must review and confirm that individual’s eligibility prior to counting their vote.
The NLRB separated each day’s vote into two segments, keeping polls open from 10:00 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and from 4:30 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. A Crimson analysis found no statistically significant difference in whether voters were more likely to vote for or against unionization between the two polling periods.

CORRECTION: April 20, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that Harvard would be the second-ever private American university to see a union form without voluntarily granting the union recognition. In fact, Harvard would join a small handful of private universities who have seen this happen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 Before last weekend’s setbacks at George Mason, the Harvard men's volleyball team had been on quite a roll. A six game win streak spanning two different months secured the Crimson a third place finish in the EIVA, and a spot in the conference tournament semifinal game on Thursday.
But Harvard (12-13, 10-4 EIVA) knew that as it flew out to Fairfax, Va., for the semifinal round against second place Penn State (15-11, 10-4 EIVA), a great finish to the regular season slate would mean less if the team could not find success in the postseason. Especially since these two sides had split the season series, a tie-breaking contest in the conference tournament loomed large.
In the epitome of a back and forth affair, the Crimson alternated winning sets with the Nittany Lions, taking the first and third before ultimately triumphing in the deciding fifth set for the 25-18, 21-25, 25-19, 18-25, 15-11 win.
“It was tough to lose the fourth set,” captain blocker Riley Moore said. “We didn’t really look good, [but] we pulled the huddle together and we just looked at each other and said 'This set is over, it doesn't matter. Just look at yourself and know you’re better than the guy playing your position on the other side.'”
It was certainly not an easy task to have that confidence entering Thursday's game. After failing to convert last weekend on a chance at the regular season crown against the Patriots, Harvard was able to quickly turn its focus to the semifinal match.
“Friday’s game [against George Mason] was a tough loss,” Moore said. “Saturday was a wash, we were focused on the playoffs. When we got in the gym on Monday we tried to put it behind us, focus on more important things, and not let old matches dictate how we play future games. We definitely know we are just as good or better than every other team in the conference.”
Against Penn State, the Crimson entered the fifth set after falling by a large margin in the fourth, 25-18. Tied at 8-8 in the fourth, a kill by Nittany Lions sophomore opposite hitter Calvin Mende, who stands at 6'11'', started a 9-2 run for Penn State. Height was an advantage for the second-seeded Lions all night, making it tough for Harvard on the offensive end.
“They’re a really big team,” Moore said. “They’re really good at blocking. They make it hard on you offensively, and try to make you make a mistake. Since the first [matchup], we’ve done a good job of limiting our own errors, and playing with a bit more confidence.”
Even with the size difference, the Crimson were able to best Penn State in blocks. It was ultimately an attack error that ended the game after Harvard went on a 9-5 run in the fifth, following a six-point tie earlier in this deciding set.
Just as it closed the contest, the Crimson opened the game with a dominant first set, winning 25-19, with three kills by Moore and two by senior setter Marko Kostich. Harvard stood strong in this first frame, forcing the taller Nittany Lions players to 13 errors while only committing five.
The second set was a different story, however. Penn State jumped out to a large lead, and although the Crimson rallied to make it 21-24, a kill by senior outside hitter Aidan Albrecht closed out the set for the Lions, 25-21.
Aside from Kostich, senior outside hitter Brad Gretsch led Harvard with 14 kills, while junior middle blocker Trevor Dow and Moore led the team with six blocks apiece.
“I thought our guys did a really good job,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “To come up with a win like that, under pressure, shows a lot.”
To the team, the job is not done. The Crimson will face Princeton on Saturday in the EIVA conference final, looking for its third win against the Tigers this season. The prior two wins bode well for Harvard’s chances, but the team understands the unique challenge at hand.
“They have a lot of different of weapons,” Baise said. “They have really good size, and they block very well. [But] our guys, they’re ready. They’re a team that can do it. They compete hard. I’m looking forward to what they can do Saturday.”

Hoping to capitalize on an impressive win in its most recent tournament, Harvard women’s golf looks to use its new momentum to reclaim the Ancient Eight crown in the Ivy League Championships.
“Our team is super hyped going into it,” freshman Jessica Luo said. “We have a nothing to lose attitude, and we’ve been preparing mentally and physically all year.”
Last season, the Crimson’s impressive five-year reign atop the conference came to an end. Princeton took home last year’s crown at the Orange Tree Golf Club in Orlando, Fla. to dethrone Harvard in dominating fashion, topping the field the entire weekend and finishing 31 strokes ahead of the second-place Crimson. This season, Harvard will travel to Metedeconk National Golf Club in the Tigers’ home state of New Jersey in an attempt to take back the trophy and avenge last season’s loss.
This season, however, the Crimson have all the momentum they could have asked for, having finished first in its latest tournament, hosting the Harvard Invitational in Osprey, Fla.
“We all really want this,” junior Anna Zhou said.“Our team is in a really good place right now.”
The Harvard Invitational included five of the seven Ivy League teams that will compete this weekend in the Ivy League Championship, including Princeton. The Tigers and Brown were tied at first after the first day of play, but Harvard roared back to head into the final day tied with Princeton. The Crimson finished strong to take home the victory by three strokes, with the Tigers finishing in fourth place.
The hotly contested weekend at The Oaks Club sets up a dramatic finale to the season between the newest champions and the recently dethroned regime. Harvard will have to travel into enemy territory, crossing into Princeton’s home state to play at Metedeconk.
“We’re looking forward to it,” captain Lita Guo said. “We’re very lucky to be able to play on that course.”
This is only the third tournament on the year for the Crimson, whose roller coaster season has seen both extreme ends of the spectrum. Before leaving the Harvard Invitational victorious, Harvard finished last in its opening tournament, the Clemson Invitational.
“Clemson was a great first tournament for everybody to get back in shape and gauge the state of our game,” Guo said. “Coming off of Clemson, which was in nice condition and had great weather, we were able to really improve our game and it really showed in our home tournament.”
Although the Crimson’s current trajectory is headed upwards following the victory in Osprey, the late stages of the season have not been free of speed bumps. Although the northeast is hardly expected to serve as a tropical paradise, this year’s uncharacteristically long winter has impeded spring practice heading into the Ivy League Championships.
“The weather outside is not really conducive to practicing, but we’re getting ready,” Luo said.
New England can often cause problems for outdoor golf practices, but the unpredictable weather has encroached on the usually more reliable middle months of the calendar year.
“It’s actually been a bit tougher this year with this winter,” Zhou said. “We’ve been driving to Rhode Island and Northern Massachusetts to practice.”
Despite the dreary conditions of the harsh Boston weather, Harvard has continued to prepare mentally and physically in the penultimate tournament of the year.
In addition to preparation, the Crimson has winning experience on its side. The program is no stranger to success in the Ivy League Championships. Several members have played a major role in the five-year dynasty atop the Ancient Eight, allowing Harvard to finish outside the top two spots only once since 2007.
Even with the experience, the team also carries two freshman who are new to the tournament. However, this will not change the team’s season-long preparation coming into the final scheduled contest of the year.
“Going into Ivies, we have the same mindset as any other tournament,” Guo said. “Although it’s Ivies, as the team—especially the the freshman—are looking forward to it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 It was raining when freshman Drake Deuel arrived at the Harvard men's Newell Boathouse on the Charles. Unable to get on the water, the rookie hopped on an erg and casually broke the lightweight half-marathon world record erg time by nearly an entire minute.
“It was an incredibly rainy, miserable day outside and we weren’t able to row, so I was indoors on the erg and I just felt really good,” Deuel said. “I knew that that time was out there, and I thought I’d go for it.”
Deuel completed the 13.1 mile, or 21,097 meter, distance in one hour, 12 minutes, and 42 seconds. The previous record was 1:13.28.6, nearly a minute slower than Deuel’s time.
“It was a pretty measured effort,” Deuel said. “It’s an hour and 12 minutes long for my time, so you have to be consistent throughout and just hold on and try not to die and run out of energy, go too fast, that sort of thing. I have a lot of experience with these long, drawn-out pieces. It’s sort of what I’m best at. For our racing, it’s usually only 2,000 meters, so that would take six or seven minutes, so it’s a very different exercise.”
Setting records is nothing new for the Dallas, Texas, native, who earlier this year set the lightweight world record in the 10,000 kilometer distance on the erg. The record was recently edged out by Canadian Maxwell Lattimer in 33:27.8. Lattimer competed for Canada in the 2016 Rio Olympics.
“He got it by like 0.8 seconds, so I have to get that one back later this year,” Deuel said. “It’s just a good bit of rivalry and fun.”
Deuel had an illustrious career at Highland Park High School, where he was a member of Dallas United Crew. In his senior year, he came in second at the 2017 Youth Nationals in the men’s single.
For senior Andre Dupuis—Deuel’s captain—the freshman’s massive accomplishment is indicative of a commitment to progress and fitness.
“Honestly, I wasn’t really that surprised,” Dupuis said. “This guy puts in a lot of work. He has a tremendous work ethic, and so I think this was just a product of all the work he put in.”
Deuel also holds the American lightweight 2k record with a time of 6:05.1. The current world record is held by Denmark’s Henrik Stephansen, who completed the distance in 5:56.7 back in 2013. Deuel is looking to the C.R.A.S.H.-B. erging competition held in Boston to potentially beat that time.
“The most important record is the olympic distance 2,000 meters, which is the standard racing distance of rowing in general for the spring season,” Deuel said. “That’s definitely the most coveted time and of course the most difficult to achieve.”
However, despite all these individual accolades, Deuel still prioritizes the performance of the rowing program as a whole and the performance of his boat, which he describes as “what really matters.” Deuel races the first varsity eight, which last week dominated Dartmouth and MIT, beating the rest of the field by more than eight seconds. The performance pushed the lightweight team into the number one ranked spot in the nation.
“The individual is important and it shows what I can do, but not at all more than what our team can do and how that fitness can translate into the boat and onto the water to help the team to achieve those results against other schools,” Deuel said.
Dupuis said that he appreciates Deuel’s sentiment and focus on the team as a whole.
“I think it’s great,” Dupuis said. “I think the team effort is what is most important for the program, so it’s great to see someone who has the drive and the level of fitness that he has and is willing to contribute into the collective effort of the team.”
Moving forward, Deuel hopes to compete in the Olympics, held in 2020. He will spend the summer training and improving his sculling with two oars, something different from the one-oar rowing of collegiate competition.
“For the olympic boat, for lightweight, it’s a double, so two guys with two oars each,” Deuel said. “I’m looking to improve my speed and rowing on the water along with my fitness to try to make something happen for Tokyo.”
In only his first year of college, Deuel has certainly made something happen.

Harvard Yard? More like Harvard Pond. Relentless rain flooded campus this week, but at least this moody aesthetic shot makes it sort-of worth it?
On Monday, runners braved the brutal storm to complete the Boston Marathon, including a few Harvard students. Meanwhile, we braved going to class, unlike the rest of the Boston area schools, which get Patriots' Day off.
The “springtime” Yard chair stands alone—with muddy water lapping at her feet, she seems to regret her apparently early debut.

Last Friday, College undergraduates gathered in Tercentenary Theater to hear Yardfest headliners Wale and Lil Yachty perform.

On Wednesday and Thursday, grad students and some eligible undergraduates voted in Harvard's unionization election. Results are still TBA, but exit polling shows a very tight race.
