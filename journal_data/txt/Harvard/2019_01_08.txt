After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This review contains spoilers for “Bandersnatch.” 
“Black Mirror,” Charlie Brooker’s darkly satirical TV brainchild, is known for lamenting the perils of modern technology with anxiety-inducing — and often, horrifically gruesome — made-for-television movies. But it’s found a brand new way of sending its viewers into a screen-obsessed panic: Its latest venture, a choose-your-own-adventure game called “Bandersnatch,” debuted on Netflix in the last days of 2018.
“Bandersnatch” takes place in the 1980s. Players only get one choice at their character, and it’s Stefan Butler (Fionn Whitehead), a programmer creating his own choose-your-own-adventure game for a company called Tuckersoft. There are multiple timelines and endings to “Black Mirror”’s game-film-hybrid, and players navigate through them by deciding between two options at every round. You’re given 10 seconds to decide if Stefan should eat Sugar Puffs or Frosties for breakfast, 10 seconds to decide if he should do LSD with legendary game designer Colin Ritman (Will Poulter), and 10 seconds to decide if he should bludgeon his father to death with a glass ashtray, or calm down.
“Black Mirror” isn’t always one for subtlety, and sometimes that’s a good thing. After all, both “Nosedive” (Season 3) and “USS Callister” (Season 4) were well-received by critics, and neither episode was coy about its premise or motivation. But “Bandersnatch” smacks you with its thesis again and again. And then one more time, just in case you didn’t already get the point. In one scene, Colin simply rambles on and on about personal freedom and the lack of it while tripping on acid, presenting the episode’s thesis in one clean monologue: “People think it’s a happy game. It’s not a happy game. It’s a fucking nightmare world, and the worst thing is, it’s real and we live in it.”
If you want to play the game, then you don’t really have much of a choice other than to play along with Colin’s “nightmare world.” “Bandersnatch” is rather relentless about this, which then raises the question (that the episode has been extremely forthcoming about) of whether or not you actually have a decision in any matter. If you choose to not have Stefan divulge the painful details of his mother’s death during a therapy session, the game forces you to share anyway. If you choose to refuse Colin’s offer of LSD, he’ll drop it into Stefan’s tea regardless, saying “I chose for you” after he spikes the drink.
And in one path, if you choose to back off instead of killing Stefan’s dad, Peter (Craig Parkinson), it’s game over. The screen will flash to two retro TVs, and you’ll have the option of restarting a few minutes back. The implication is that you were supposed to make the more violent choice if you really wanted to “beat the game,” which just means rolling the credits in “Black Mirror”’s case. That is the very definition of a “nightmare world”: Playing “Bandersnatch” from Stefan’s perspective means that the player will be embodying his character during the game. (In one path, the camera shifts to his POV so you can fall with him as he jumps off a roof, rather than watching him commit suicide.) And generally speaking, people want to choose the least traumatic events for themselves.
But “Black Mirror” encourages the opposite in “Bandersnatch” because, well, it’s “Black Mirror.” If you end up taking the most bloody path in all the timelines (killing Peter and chopping up his body), Stefan will finally impress an irritating game-reviewer with his product, earning himself five stars while sitting in jail. In fact, choosing the most peaceful timeline will earn Stefan zero stars for his game, and will cut “Bandersnatch” short, leaving the player with an unsatisfying ending and the option to try again. This comes immediately after accepting an offer from Tuckersoft for Stefan, at which the episode wants to let you know that you’ve messed up. “Sorry mate, wrong path,” Colin says to Stefan, but it feels like the message is really meant for the player.
And thanks to “Bandersnatch”’s less than graceful writing, it’s too clear what exactly that message is: Everything is hopeless! We’re all stuck in a box! The world can be a horrible and cruel place! That’s already the premise for most “Black Mirror” episodes, except “Bandersnatch” isn’t nearly as engaging — ironic, as it’s supposed to be an interactive game. That might be its Achilles’ heel: “Bandersnatch” lacks the usual paranoia-driven plotline because it’s already fractured by its very structure. Theoretically, that could be saved by interesting characters, but “Bandersnatch”’s main player is remarkably dull, with a tragic backstory artificially injected to induce sympathy. There’s not even pure suspense to make the alternate realities as compelling as they should be, because the clunky plot structure just isn’t up to speed with the episode’s innovative platform.
Besides the frustratingly grating message, “Bandersnatch” does have its better moments. One of the more complicated endings involves Stefan going back in time, and allowing his child-self to die with his mother in a train crash. In the present day, Stefan dies quietly in his chair, and it’s clear that he’s achieved some sort of peace or resolution from the past trauma, even though it’s one that leaves his father distraught, and perhaps, the player uncomfortable with the events unfolding in front of them. The scene is one of “Black Mirror”’s best for this reason: There is no clear-cut answer of right or wrong when it comes to this choice, making its unresolved question all the more thoughtful.
“Bandersnatch” also finds its footing with its most meta-commentary — the scenes where the episode doesn’t just break through the fourth wall, but burns it down. While “Bandersnatch”’s theories on control and technology are inelegantly presented through clumsy dialogue, the episode shines when you’re given the option to explain to Stefan (reminder: he lives in the 1980s) what Netflix is, and why he feels like he might be in a choose-your-own-adventure game himself. Should you choose this path, two options ensue, one of which involves a delightfully-choreographed fight scene at the therapy office. “Fucked up your day properly!” Stefan screams at his therapist. “Me and my friend from the future!”
“Bandersnatch” also self-critiques through its episode’s resident game critic (Robin, played by Paul Bradley), who appears in several endings to give Stefan’s final product a star rating. It feels like both a preemptive defense against the potential onslaught of criticisms, and a slight jab at the very act of reviewing itself (which, this amateur TV critic thought was hilarious, and perhaps well-deserved).
But just because “Black Mirror” acknowledges its potential faults, doesn’t mean it’s absolved of them. How many stars does “Bandersnatch” get? In the spirit of “Black Mirror”’s bold move into interactive television and choose-your-own-adventures, try the game, and decide for yourself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rhodes Scholar Jin K. Park ’18-19 will embark for England this fall — but he may not be able to return.
Due to his immigration status, Park — the first ever Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals beneficiary to win the Rhodes Scholarship — could be denied reentry into the United States if he leaves to pursue a master's at Oxford. The risk has left Park undeterred, however, and he said he plans to accept the scholarship.
“People keep asking me, ‘Aren’t you afraid?’ I’m afraid of the fact that nothing seems to be in my control but when I think about that, if you’re undocumented in America, nothing’s ever in your control. So you kind of just go through life,” Park said.
DACA is an Obama-era initiative that allows undocumented youth to legally live and work in the U.S. Recipients of DACA are nicknamed “Dreamers” after the DREAM Act, which would have created a pathway to legal status for undocumented minors but was never passed by Congress. President Trump sought to repeal DACA in September 2017, but his efforts were blocked by federal judges in California, New York, and Washington D.C. who ordered federal injunctions maintaining the program.
The Obama administration had previously allowed “Dreamers” to travel abroad under limited circumstances, such as academic study, via a provision called “advance parole.” U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, however, stopped accepting and approving advance parole requests from DACA recipients on Sept. 5, 2017. As the current administration seeks a Supreme Court review of the federal judges’ rulings, it warns DACA recipients that going abroad without previously granted advance parole approval “automatically terminates your deferred action under DACA.”
“Essentially what’s happening is if you’re undocumented, if you overstayed a visa like I did, and if you leave, you can’t come back,” said Park, who is in contact with legal counsel to better understand his case’s legal intricacies.
USCIS did not respond to a request for comment.
Park was aware of these risks when he first applied for the scholarship in 2017. Despite being ineligible for the Rhodes due to his “Dreamer” status, Park applied with the support of Harvard's Office of Undergraduate Research and Fellowships.
“Institutions have the latitude to endorse whomever they choose,” URAF Director Gregory A. Llacer wrote in an emailed statement. “I had known Jin before he applied the first time, and I simply told him when he asked me that we would support his application even though technically he was ineligible (although DACA was not a defined eligibility/ineligibility class for Rhodes back then).”
Park said he never expected to win but only hoped he could spark dialogue about eventually allowing undocumented students to apply for the scholarship. Though he was ultimately not chosen, his application prompted the Rhodes Trust to consider opening the scholarship to DACA recipients.
DACA recipients became eligible to apply for the Rhodes Scholarship for the first time in 2018, when Park reapplied and became the first “Dreamer” Rhodes Scholar.
Park said he plans to accept the scholarship, in part because “a perpetual inability to plan long term is kind of something that is just ingrained in how I choose my opportunities.” He will pursue master's degrees in Global Health Science and Epidemiology as well as Migration Studies in order to learn how to improve health policy for immigrants.
“We tell this joke where, DACA recipients, we have to plan our lives in two year increments because two years is how often you have to renew DACA,” Park said.
Regarding the uncertainty that Park now faces, Llacer said that URAF will “always support Jin philosophically,” but “in practice, URAF now is on the periphery.”
Babette Tegldal, the director of communications of the Rhodes Trust, wrote in an emailed statement that the Trust will not comment directly on Jin’s situation but supports his case and hopes that it will work out.
Now, Park is working with Define American, a media nonprofit dedicated to shifting the conversation surrounding immigrants, to discuss his options. Executive Director Ryan M. Eller said he is committed to “utilizing some of our partners, including legal partners both at Harvard and with other organizations to advise [Park].”
“I keep telling him that it’s a horribly unfortunate decision that he has to make because in a world where most of us have the privilege of just being able to travel anywhere, for some reason, we have put people like Jin in a box and restricted his ability to continue his education,” Eller said.
Even if the U.S. government chooses not to allow Park to return to the States, Eller said that Park, who serves as a Define American chapter leader, has the organization’s backing.
“We’re going to work with him to try to figure it out, and make sure that at least he knows that even if our government doesn’t recognize him as an American, we have a whole community of millions of folks strong who absolutely not only believe that he is an American, but that he represents the best of what we can be,” Eller said.
Park said that many others have reassured him that because he’s a Rhodes Scholar “you can take your talents anywhere, and every country should be taking you.” But he rejects the notion that an immigrant has to be a Rhodes Scholar to be afforded “basic human decency.” When arguing for undocumented immigrants’ rights to reside in the U.S., Park said he avoids citing their “moral deservingness, talents, economic productivity.”
He said he wants to be allowed to return to the U.S. not because he’s “talented” but because it’s his home. He added that it is his unwavering sense of “home” — which Park defines as Queens, N.Y., where he grew up — that keeps him grounded.
“I know where I belong. If I have to spend the rest of my life trying to convince this country to let me back in then that’s what I’m going to do,” he said. “Humans make roots in ways that are defined by more than just how many kids you have here or whether or not you were born here. Home is really to what extent a human being is embedded within the network of social practices in a given society.”
Park said his parents share his worries, but they also share his conviction in his place in the U.S. He said winning the scholarship is a way to repay the sacrifices that they made for him and a way to continue his service to the immigrant community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Returning back to the ice after an extended winter break, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team fell to two in-conference opponents in Quinnipiac and Princeton this past weekend. Limited to just 13 players dressed for play, the Crimson looks forward to the return of star freshman Dominique Petrie, who is currently away from the team captaining the U.S. U-18 women’s national side.
QUINNIPIAC 1, HARVARD 0
With only 24 hours of turnaround following the Princeton contest, Harvard hit the ice again for a matchup with another ECAC foe in Quinnipiac. The Bobcats (7-11-3, 6-5-1 ECAC) came into the matchup with momentum, having defeated the Big Green of Dartmouth by a sound 5-1 margin on Friday night.
Despite Quinnipiac’s recent high-powered display of offense, the Crimson locked down the Cats, holding them to one goal as freshman goalie Lindsay Reed led the defensive effort with a 32-save performance. That being said, while the Quinnipiac found the back of the net in the middle of the third period, Harvard could not capitalize on any offensive chances, and the Crimson fell in a 1-0 decision.
“One thing that we should be focusing on and that we’ve talked a little bit about is valuing the puck and having that gritty desire to score,” junior forward Kat Hughes said. “It’s not always going to be pretty, but I think sometimes we just need to recognize that, shoot the puck more, and take every opportunity that teams give us.”
As the first 45 minutes of the game time ticked away without a goal from either side, the teams remained deadlocked in more than just the scoreline. Quinnipiac held slim advantages over Harvard in shots on goal (33-28) and blocked shots (17-13), but the Crimson returned the favor by edging the Bobcats 33-31 in faceoffs won. Both teams only had one power play opportunity as the two squads almost escaped the game without having to go the box.
Dealing with injuries, staying disciplined was especially important for Harvard as the Crimson played only 13 skaters on the afternoon compared to the Bobcats’ 18. Most significantly, only four Crimson defenders split up the defensive workload, so any time spent in the box could prove to be critical. Harvard did rally around its limited numbers, but the short bench still proved to be a major challenge.
“At the end of the day, everybody contributed, and everybody stepped up and did well in their roles that they were put in,” senior forward Bradley Fusco said. “I think that, overall, we played well even though we had few numbers. It just is hard to have consistent pressure when we only have three lines and four [defenders], but overall, we worked hard and we’ve trained hard.”
The two teams continued to lock each other down on defense, with Harvard matching Quinnipiac despite the numbers discrepancy. Defense prevailed, and the team that scored first would have a great chance to ice the game with even just one tally.
“We talked about it before the game that we wanted to pin the puck along the boards and stop plays when we could instead of letting the [other] team have momentum in the offensive zone,” Fusco said.
Despite Harvard’s inspired, shorthanded effort to thwart Quinnipiac, the Bobcats found a breakthrough. 6:16 into the final frame, the difference in the game unfolded as Quinnipiac senior forward Melissa Samoskevich found her way to a loose puck and buried the ensuing chance to put the Bobcats up 1-0.
“For the whole shift, at least, we were kind of controlling the play [and] had a good breakout,” Hughes said. “[We] were on the forecheck, and our forecheck was doing well. We were able to make them have a pretty messy breakout, which led to a chip out of the zone. It was really a 50-50 puck whether our defense would come up with it or their player. Unfortunately, they got it, and it was just kind of an unlucky shot that’s hard to see.”
After Quinnipiac pulled ahead, the Crimson scrapped on the offensive side of the ice in the third period to try to even the scoreline. Over the last stanza, Harvard outshot the Bobcats 14-10. With two minutes remaining, the Crimson pulled Reed for an extra skater. With 37 seconds left on the clock, Harvard had perhaps its best scoring opportunity of the game as Quinnipiac took a two-minute minor penalty for checking.
“That was actually our first power play of the game, so we were excited for that,” Hughes said. “We were just focusing on getting the puck to the net—nothing special just keeping it simple and working hard in front of the net to put it away. Unfortunately, it didn’t happen, but it’s always good practice for those situations, and you learn for next time.”
Despite Harvard’s flurry of chances on the two-skater advantage, the Crimson could not crack the Bobcat defense. In the final seconds of the game, Quinnipiac rallied to block three Harvard power-play shots before they even reached the net. Also, being on the penalty kill, the Bobcats could ice the puck without a whistle and aim for the empty net, presenting a unique challenge.
“We haven’t done many six-on-four situations before,” Fusco said. “The issue was that they could ice the puck and shoot for the empty net from anywhere. We knew that we had to put a lot of pressure on them when we didn’t have control or needed to gain control. We would have liked to see more shots and score a goal to tie it up, but we might be in that situation again, so we’ll learn from our mistakes.”
The Bobcats complemented scrappy shot-blocking with goaltending as Quinnipiac junior goalie Abbie Ives was resolute throughout the game, posting a 28-save shutout by the time the final buzzer rang. The 1-0 score held as the final, and Harvard dropped to 4-8-2 on the season with a 3-5-1 mark in the ECAC.
PRINCETON 4, HARVARD 1
Princeton handed the Crimson its first loss of 2019 in a meetup on Friday at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center characterized by strong defensive performances from both sides for large portions of the game. However, a four-minute spate of offensive fire from the No. 6/6 Tigers (12-2-4, 10-0-2 ECAC) broke the game wide open at the tail end of the second period.
“We kind of let our jobs get away from us, and the energy we were having in the first period kind of slipped away, and Princeton was able to capitalize on that,” Hughes said. “Unfortunately, we couldn’t tie it up again.”
The visitors gained their first lead of the game against a shorthanded Harvard side with 4:53 left in the second period. A series of Princeton passes on Crimson ice eventually delivered the puck to freshman forward Maggie Connors, who swiftly settled, shot, and scored.
Despite Harvard’s return to full strength, the Tigers were just getting started. A similar back-and-forth series 38 seconds later put the puck on sophomore forward Shannon Griffin’s stick, who fired past the posts to put Princeton up 3-1. Three minutes later, Connors scored another power play goal.
“Overall, we played well, we just let five minutes get away from us, which is not what we want to do,” Fusco said.
Barring those final five minutes of the second period, the Crimson held its own against the Tigers, who entered riding a 14-game unbeaten streak. Coming off a nearly month-long break due to reading period, final exams, and end-of-the-year holidays, Harvard took the ice with zeal.
“I think we had a lot of energy coming into the game, and we were excited to play after coming off a long break,” Fusco said.
Ten minutes after the puck dropped, a Crimson power play gave Harvard what it needed. A whack from the blue line by junior defender Ali Peper sailed by the Princeton goalie to give the Crimson a 1-0 lead.
Two minutes later, another Tigers penalty offered Harvard an opportunity to pull away. Then, the puck found Princeton freshman forward Sarah Fillier. The ECAC Rookie of the Month maneuvered down the ice and flicked one by freshman goalie Lindsay Reed for the Tigers’ second short-handed goal of the season.
The power play expired, and the remainder of the first elapsed with no clear leader, both sides trading shots.
The second began as the first ended — frequent puck motion and changes in possession, but no changes in score. Stellar netminding by Reed saw 19 saves, including a behind-the-back kick eight minutes in, before Princeton’s second goal of the game marked the start of the fateful four minutes.
After the close of the second, the Crimson regrouped and entered the third with renewed vigor. Reed, whose save percentage is first in the ECAC and second in the nation, notched nine more saves while allowing no goals, but Harvard was also unable to score.
“I think in the third period, we were able to match with them again, and kind of get back into our game,” Hughes said.
In spite of the lopsided score, the Crimson saw promise in its first game of the year. Facing injuries and other absences, Harvard hopes to return to the win column with a more complete squad.

Headed into Tuesday’s matchup, the Harvard men’s hockey team and Boston University had been forced to overtime in three of their last six meetings, including the Terriers’ emotional double-overtime victory in last year’s Beanpot semifinal.
The mid-week tilt at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center added yet another chapter of extra hockey to the Harvard-BU rivalry, with the teams arriving at a 2-2 stalemate after 65 minutes.
“Although we’re never happy not getting two points at home, I thought…it was a really good college hockey game and…we did some things better than we’ve been doing them,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “All in all, we had some chances to maybe get the win. I’m sure they feel they had some…. The result was probably what it should be.”
The Terriers’ first game back from a four-week holiday hiatus marked the 156th installment of the crosstown clash, in which BU (6-8-3, 5-5-2 Hockey East) holds the series lead by a count of 80-69-7.
Thanks to a late-second-period equalizer from Harvard (6-4-3, 3-3-2 ECAC), the teams entered the final frame knotted at one. The Crimson began the period on the man advantage and finally cashed in 5-on-4 after failing to do so on its first two chances of the game.
Freshman forward Casey Dornbach fired a shot from the circle to the left of BU goaltender Jake Oettinger. The puck ricocheted off classmate Jack Drury and bounced into the slot, where co-captain Lewis Zerter-Gossage punched it home.
The powerplay tally continues Harvard’s man-up hot streak. The extra-man unit, which leads the nation in effectiveness (36.0%), has potted at least one goal in all but three games this season and, on four occasions, has converted multiple times.
Even prior to his secondary assist on the Zerter-Gossage goal, Dornbach paced the NCAA in powerplay assists per game. Tuesday night’s performance elevated his nation-best number to 0.77. Dornbach’s apple also thrust him ahead of teammate Adam Fox for the highest assist-per-game mark in college hockey (1.23).
“Casey is a heck of a player. He’s had a great start so far,” coach Donato said. “Offensively, he’s really stepped right in and been very dynamic. [He’s] a key part of the powerplay, has helped us five-on-five, and his speed and skill…have been a big part of our offense.”
The Crimson did not hold its 2-1 lead for long, however. Four minutes after the go-ahead goal from the home team’s co-captain, BU freshman Joel Farabee beat Harvard net-minder Michael Lackey with a wrist shot.
The snipe notched the score at 2-2 and set the stage for an emotional overtime game-winner. Alas, neither team would find the back of the net in the additional five minutes
“Any time it’s an out-of-conference opponent, you really want to bear down and get those points,” Zerter-Gossage said. “We felt like we dictated the play a lot, especially in the third.”
With three minutes remaining in the middle stanza, Fox evened the score after Harvard trailed for the better part of two periods. The junior blue-liner handled a pass from sophomore forward Jack Badini and wasted no time ripping a wrist shot over the right pad of Oettinger.
With the goal, Fox got back on the scoresheet after another pointless outing on Friday. Fox opened the campaign on a nine-game point streak (5–15—20) before failing to register a goal or assist in three consecutive showings. Tuesday, he returned to his usual scoring form.
“[Getting back on the scoresheet] is good. Obviously, it’s not something I try and think about too much going into games,” Fox said. “I wasn’t getting points, but we were getting wins, so it wasn’t really too big of a concern.”
The Terriers struck first in Tuesday night’s tilt. Just two minutes into the contest, freshman forward Matthew Quercia potted his first collegiate goal after burying a net-front feed from senior linemate Ryan Cloonan. The rookie’s tally marked the sixth time in 13 games that Harvard has conceded the first strike.
The Crimson also regained the services of Drury, who spent the last three weeks training for and competing in the IIHF World Junior Championship, junior hockey’s grandest international tournament. Drury, who plays a vital two-way role in coach Donato’s systems, brought home a silver medal. Two of his American teammates at the tournament became his foes on Tuesday evening: BU sophomore Logan Cockerill and freshman Joel Farabee.
“I think if you asked [BU coach] Albie [O’Connell], he would say the same thing: those guys are tired,” coach Donato said. “You play on that stage, for that many games, that much passion and that kind of emotional atmosphere and the travel…. Jack Drury is a warrior, and he was super excited to get back in the lineup, and just having him in there gives our group a boost.”
Harvard will embark on two formidable road weekends in the middle of January, visiting Princeton and No. 6 Quinnipiac before tripping to Upstate New York to battle No. 17 Cornell and Colgate. Having Drury back in the lineup will assist the squad in regaining its mounting momentum, which the month-long winter break halted.
