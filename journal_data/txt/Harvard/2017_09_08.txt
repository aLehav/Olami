After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Wearing his iconic leather jacket and a pair of water skis, sitcom hero Arthur Herbert Fonzarelli jumped over a shark in season five of the 1970s television series “Happy Days.” But while the Fonz’s half-nude fictional cronies cheered on the beach, his fans and critics fulminated on the other side of the TV screen. Such a preposterous stunt, they cried, was out of the show’s character! In its desperate, ultimately unsuccessful ploy to revamp ratings, “Happy Days” had forgotten itself.
Like the Fonz, Harvard is jumping the shark—not with plastic TV props, but with unrecognized social groups. The witty banter between closed-door deliberations and public backlash over exclusive social organizations, and the meme-laden laugh track cued when faculty members filed a second motion against the College’s recommendations to phase out such groups, certainly seem like typical plot elements of the Harvard College Sitcom. But in reality, they’re stunts. Like the shark in “Happy Days,” the debate over unrecognized social groups shows just how much Harvard has forgotten itself.
Harvard College’s purpose is straightforward: “The mission of Harvard College,” the official statement reads, “is to educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society.” Harvard achieves this objective, so it claims, through its “commitment to the transformative power of a liberal arts and sciences education.” In other words, Harvard is foremost a school, an academic institution designed to provide students an education in exchange for tuition, contributions to research, alumni donations, and a prestigious claim to the success graduates later achieve, which in turn attracts more students. Matriculation is fundamentally a business transaction. Diplomas are receipts for the service Harvard is paid to provide.
But as the debate over exclusive social groups shows, students and faculty have lost sight of this basic arrangement. Instead, they insist that Harvard is so much more than simply a school; it’s a transformational experience, a diverse community, a place where we all belong. Welcome videos, warm emails, Yard banners, convocation speeches, and fuzzy mantras like “community” and “belonging” push students and faculty into believing that Harvard is not primarily an educational transaction, but a home.
If Harvard is more a of home than a school, the administration becomes more of a parent than a principal, and the student becomes more of a child than a client. Faculty and students alike begin to believe all aspects of Harvard should be as welcoming, inclusive, and comfortable as their own homes. And as a result, they come to see joining organizations that don’t fit these homey descriptors—be it final clubs or Greek life—as a punishable offense, regardless of whether it falls under the administration’s principally academic jurisdiction. By endorsing these expectations, students and faculty license the College to overstep its bounds—to extend its authority beyond the classroom and into students’ social lives.
This isn’t to suggest Harvard should stop calling itself a home. As the College’s mission statement specifies, living on campus with diverse peers is a crucial component of Harvard’s transformational education. Moreover, some students consider the College the only home they have, and almost all students learn better in a comfortable environment than in an unwelcoming one. But we cannot mistake supplementary aspects of Harvard for its primary purpose. As the mission statement stubbornly insists, a transformational education begins in the classroom. Harvard is a school first, anything else second.
If we focus on Harvard the home to the extent that we forget about Harvard the educational transaction, we risk not only inviting administrative intrusions into students’ social lives, but also, perhaps more sinisterly, adopting expectations that put emotional or social comfort before intellectual growth. By insisting it’s a home before a school, Harvard invites students to view the discomfort necessary for intellectual development as an encroachment on their intellectual complacency, not as an essential part of the transaction they made by matriculating here.
At home, we’re used to being cozy. We view any discomfort or disagreement as an unjust threat to our peace of mind. But at the world’s leading research university, conflict becomes the means to progress. The discomfort of difference and debate is essential to intellectual advancement. As developing thinkers, we must not avoid strife by deferring to others’ opinions, or insist upon our right to be comfortable by forcing others to do so for us. We’re not supposed to be comfortable here; we’re supposed to challenged by opposing, even offensive, views, colliding in debates and wrestling with conflicting ideas. By no means should we stop calling Harvard home. But by no means should we forget we came here first to learn and second to belong.
The sitcom drama spinning around unrecognized social groups, then, is really just evidence that Harvard, by overemphasizing itself as a home, has forgotten its primary purpose as an academic transaction—a misallocation of priorities that seriously threatens the education it promises to provide. This social group shark, far from attracting more matriculating viewers, simply shows how far the College has strayed from what made it successful in the first place. Let’s just hope that unlike “Happy Days,” Harvard can remember itself before the season ends.

Ever since Professor David J. Malan ’99 started teaching Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I,” the class has experienced a meteoric rise in undergraduate enrollment and consistently pushed the boundaries of what a class can offer at Harvard. Despite its popularity, it has also been the subject of considerable controversy over the years, running the gamut from accusations of circumventing Harvard policies to enigmatic trademark applications to, most recently and notably, a cheating scandal that saw 60 enrollees face charges of academic dishonesty.
In the past, we have not been overly sympathetic to the course administration, in particular criticizing its vague and amorphous academic integrity policy that could have easily led to inadvertent violations by students. Though the course has not followed our exact proposal—in fact, it maintains that recent changes are not in response to this spring’s scandal—it has nevertheless rolled out a set of revamped policies and logistics this semester that will increase the likelihood that Harvard undergraduates will be able to fully take advantage of the opportunities it offers, all the while steering clear of the Honor Council.
Among the changes include making pass-fail the default grading basis for the class. Though students will still have the option to receive a letter grade, this standard will likely nudge enrollees toward the lower stress alternative. Students graded on a pass-fail scale, in turn, will be less likely to be concerned about landing low on the curve and underperforming their peers, and hence less likely to resort to cheating. Instead, they will concentrate on improving their computer science skills, whatever their previous level of aptitude or experience. It will also decrease the potential stigma attached to taking the class pass-fail or the anxiety surrounding a letter grade; students who may otherwise have avoided computer science will feel empowered to explore the field with less risk.
Moreover, the class will now encourage students to attend its weekly two hour lectures and also require them to attend weekly sections until the first midterm. We are hopeful these changes will create a better support structure for students—in particular so that they are directly engaging and interacting with course staff—which should encourage them to ask for help rather than plagiarize solutions off of the Internet when they feel under pressure.
Though these changes may seem small, we are hopeful they will go a long way in remedying the problems that CS50 has faced in the past. As it is never straightforward for such a large class to change from year to year, we commend CS50’s responsiveness to recent events. Indeed, despite all the fanfare and spectacle surrounding the class, it can be changes such as these that make the student experience all the more worthwhile and fulfilling.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a frigid spring day this past semester, my Humanities 10 section was debating how the protagonist’s promiscuous and destructive sexuality in “The Tale of Genji,” an 11th century Japanese novel, compared to the social norms of his time. Ideas bounced around the cramped semicircle of chairs, with the rustling of pages and scratching of pens filling the occasional pauses.
Our question of social norms sparked a discussion about the difference between a “character” and a “construct,” a distinction that one of my fellow Hum 10ers put very succinctly.
My classmate defined a construct as a metacommentary on what it means to be of a certain condition, an understanding of what it means to be part of a given group. A character is more individualized and exceptional, a person with unique agency.
That nuance struck me more than anything else that day, and I walked out of Boylston into the glacial Cambridge air, wondering how that distinction could be applied to my world. My contention is that we should treat people as characters much more often than we currently do, reducing our dependence on constructs.
In our society, especially in the opinion pages of The Crimson, I have observed that people frequently frame their experiences and views within the confines of a construct rather than describing themselves as characters. People introduce themselves and their ideas in a template: “As a [insert ethnicity] [insert sexuality] [insert gender identity] from [insert geographical location] with [insert socioeconomic background], I think/feel ______.”
There are several issues with this framework. When we make statements in the format of, “As a ______, I think ______,” we are presumptive enough to believe that an entire group’s experiences mirror our own. It also encourages people to fixate on checkboxes, characteristics ranging from political affiliation to religion to occupation to race to gender to immigration status. Those terms are appropriate for a generic survey, but are inadequate when attempting to truly understand the complex inner workings of a human being.
There is a significant difference between this intellectual error and saying something along the lines of: “I am a ______ and here’s what I think about ______.” That statement makes some attempt to separate between membership in a group and individual, character-driven thoughts on a subject.
We deviate from this notion, though, because we are unwilling to take the risk of framing ourselves in terms of our own lives and experiences. By implying that an entire group shares our experiences and opinions with the “As a ______” format, we can hide behind these constructs and reduce the risk that we will be personally criticized.
Although this template is sometimes convenient, it is irresponsible. Constructs lump people together, making them into generic labels, beliefs, and experiences that can be checked off in boxes on questionnaires. These generalizations erase our character. In the process, it discounts our agency and assumes that we are merely the sum of past experiences. It ascribes all opinions to the past and is not an adequate means of learning about another human being or even about ourselves.
Moreover, it is highly hypocritical. People abhor the thought of someone else applying a group construct to them, but we constantly do it to ourselves. It’s hypocritical to expect others to avoid jumping to conclusions based on our group membership when we constantly define ourselves by these limitations from the outset.
Don’t misunderstand—I do not believe that we should disregard the role that both history as a whole and our personal histories play in our lives. In the words of William Faulkner, “History is not was; it is.” However, I have to believe that we are more than the sum of our experiences; history “is” present, as Faulkner says, but we are more than our histories. That’s how people with difficult backgrounds are able to surmount their past challenges, writing their own success stories. No one claims that it’s easy, but it requires risking vulnerability and refusing to accept limitations. It means we must refuse to blindly accept the constructs that are imposed on us and that we too often impose on ourselves.
One of my professors told us that, “Complexity is something we try to avoid because it’s a pain in the ass, but it’s the only honest way to look at something that you care about.” We have a responsibility to look at each other and ourselves with complexity, and to ask genuine questions to learn what’s beneath the surface rather than attributing everything to a construct.
Don’t sell yourself or others short. Have the courage to embrace complexity, probe supposed anomalies, and see people for who they really are. That will make all of us characters worth knowing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 7, 2017 at 9:29 p.m.
Thirty-one professors from Harvard and other Boston-area universities were arrested Thursday for blocking traffic along Massachusetts Ave. in protest of President Donald Trump’s decision to rescind an Obama-era program that gives legal protections to undocumented young people.
Professors took to the street outside Johnston Gate in a planned act of civil disobedience, forming a human chain and blocking traffic on Mass Ave. Before the arrests, Cambridge Police officers read a written statement warning protesters that they would be arrested if they did not move.
According to Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Jeremy Warnick, the protesters face charges of disturbing the peace and bail is set at $40. After posting bail, they will be required to appear before a judge tomorrow morning, Deputy Superintendent Jack Albert wrote in an email.
African and African American Studies professor Walter Johnson, who was among those arrested, spoke of a “moral responsibility” to stand with undocumented students.
“It just came to a point of crisis, both for the nation and for us,” Johnson said. “It seemed like it was time for us to jump off, and to try to both stand firmly with our students, to stand for justice and decency in the face of an unjust law, and to try and kick off a conversation about resistance between campuses in Boston and among faculty.”
Trump’s decision Tuesday drew strong criticism from top Harvard administrators, including University President Drew G. Faust—who denounced the move as “cruel”—and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana. Several dozen Harvard students benefit from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which provides work authorizations and relief from deportation to undocumented young people who arrived in the United States at a young age.
Kirsten A. Weld, a History professor who started a conversation about the DACA repeal over a faculty email list, was also among those arrested. That conversation led to a meeting Wednesday morning, where roughly 75 to 100 faculty members from Harvard, Tufts, MIT, Babson, and other area universities brainstormed what they could do to support undocumented students, according to Weld.
Weld said the professors wanted to do more than sign a petition, and felt it was “high time” to act. In a speech to the crowd, she said three of the students in her 14-person course were undocumented.
“It’s not business as usual because the Trump administration is targeting our students,” Weld said in an interview before her arrest.
Divinity School professor Ahmed Ragab was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in downtown Boston just an hour before he was arrested in the protest.
“This is something that allows me to live under protection, to be safe and secure,” Ragab said of his new citizenship status. “It feels so sad to see that on the day, at the time that I’m getting these rights, that my students are being deported and taken away from this country, that is their country.”
Before the arrests, several professors, one undocumented student, Massachusetts State Representative Marjorie C. Decker, and Memorial Church Minister Jonathan L. Walton spoke of the need to take action against the policy outside Massachusetts Hall to a crowd of roughly 300 students, faculty, and affiliates from five different universities. Khurana was also at the protest.
Walton, who was later arrested, denounced the Trump administration in his remarks.
“We are here to say to the U.S. President, to his Attorney General, and to all the insecure leaders of this nation, that no human being is illegal,” Walton said.
Trump’s decision to end DACA in six months sparked outrage across campus Tuesday, and hundreds of Harvard affiliates gathered to protest in front of Memorial Hall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s student unionization effort could come to an end at the hands of Republican appointees to the National Labor Relations Board, one of a number of ways labor experts say the years-long movement could ultimately stall.
Since last year, a coalition of students at Harvard have organized to form a union and collectively bargain with the University in contract negotiations for teaching and research jobs. After a series of legal disputes about a voter list generated by Harvard before the Nov. 2016 election, the unionization question now lies with the NLRB in Washington, D.C.
President Donald Trump has nominated two members to the five-member NLRB, a shift to the right that labor experts say could favor Harvard as the board takes up the University’s appeal. The NLRB could also choose not review Harvard’s appeal.
William Gould IV, chairman of the NLRB under President Bill Clinton, said he thought the board would likely review the case.
“Generally, the board would take very seriously the absences from any voting list,” he said. “This would be a likely candidate for review.”
At the beginning of Trump’s term, there were two Democrats, one Republican, and two vacancies on the board.  Since then, the Senate has confirmed Republican Marvin J. Kaplan and will vote on the confirmation of William Emanuel, another Republican. It could still be weeks before the Senate confirms Emmanuel.  According to Gould, Democrats tend to favors unions, while Republicans tend to side more with employers.
“Even if he’s voted on in the next week or so, he probably is not going to be acting until the late part of the month at the earliest,” Gould said.
Gordon Lafer, a professor of labor law at the University of Oregon, said this delay could benefit Harvard.
“My concern if I were the union would be that this was a sign that they’re playing for time for the Trump labor board,” he said.
Not only does the University stand a good chance of winning its appeal in front of an NLRB with a Republican majority, but an NLRB decision could affect student unionization efforts at private universities around the country.
Student unionization efforts have sprung up at schools like Harvard, Yale, and Columbia in the wake of a 2016 NLRB decision that ruled graduate students at private universities are employees and therefore eligible to unionize. In reviewing Harvard’s appeal, the NLRB could overturn this precedent.
Gould said there is a “substantial possibility” that the NLRB will rule this way if Emanuel is confirmed before the board releases its decision on Harvard’s appeal.
But if the board rules in favor of the unionization effort and Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers—the proposed name of the union—wins the re-vote, Harvard could further draw out the process by refusing to negotiate with the union in hopes of the NLRB overruling the original decision. Gould said the NLRB cannot legally compel Harvard to negotiate with a union, but a federal court could.
“Suppose the union wins this and the union wins the other election,” Lafer said. “What anti-union attorneys would council Harvard to do is to refuse to bargain.”
Warning that the NLRB’s decision could harm “unionization efforts across the country,” union organizer and graduate student Andrew B. Donnelly criticized Harvard’s choice to appeal. He said Harvard’s argument that past NLRB precedent is “outdated” means the University is “trying to change the law.”
“Harvard’s taking advantage of a right wing NLRB to change labor law,” he said.
In an emailed statement, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Ann Hall said the University hopes the federal NLRB will find Harvard’s appeal valid.
“The University is eager to resolve these issues and confirm the outcome of the November 2016 election,” she wrote. “We value the contributions made by Harvard’s students and are committed to protecting academic freedom, the integrity of our teaching and research mission, and continually strengthening the experience of our students, who are at the heart of Harvard’s learning, teaching, and scholarship.”
Even as Harvard’s appeal is pending before the NLRB, students at other private universities continue to hold unionization elections. Students from Boston College will head to the polls on September 12 and 13.

The search for Harvard’s next president remains in “information-gathering mode” several months after University President Drew G. Faust announced that she will step down at the end of the academic year, according to a member of the committee leading the search.
According to Susan L. Graham, a member of the Harvard Corporation, the search committee met numerous times over the summer to discuss the search and the qualities they’d like to see in Harvard’s next president. The committee has not yet discussed individual candidates, she said. All twelve members of the Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, and three members of the Board of Overseers, the University’s second highest governing board, serve on the search committee.
“You have to know what you're looking for before you consider particular individuals,” Graham said. “When you do a search you start out by not only talking among yourselves, but talking to a ton of other people. And that’s what we’re doing.”
The committee will work with two advisory panels of faculty and students to eventually narrow down a list of candidates from several hundred to a short list the committee will ultimately choose from, Corporation senior fellow William F. Lee’ 72 said this summer.
The process could take months: Harvard’s previous presidential search, resulting in Faust’s selection, lasted nearly ten months.
During the 2001 search—before the creation of the student and faculty advisory committees in 2006—members of the search committee were sitting down with House Committee chairs and Undergraduate Council leaders by October. On Oct. 13, 2001, the committee announced that it had a list of 400 potential candidates, which came out of 200 personal interviews and a thousand letters from affiliates.
Graham, who was also on the search committee that selected Faust in 2007 and has known her for years, said she “exudes values” and is a “wonderful communicator.” Graham also praised Faust’s efforts to better integrate Harvard’s various schools, which formerly had been more disparate.
“Nobody fits every requirement,” Graham said. “Part of what you do when you do a search is try to judge the likelihood that the person will grow into the parts of the role that he or she hasn’t held before.”
Although Faust came from Harvard’s smallest school, the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, her experience as a dean meant she was used to dealing with the problems that come with running an institution, including budgetary issues. Former Executive Vice President Ed C. Forst ’82 said in a May interview that Faust was able to make choices as she was backed into a corner by the financial crisis.
Finding a leader who can handle the financial side of running Harvard will likely be important this time around. Last year, Harvard Management Company lost almost $2 billion in endowment value, and it is unclear how HMC will fare this year.
“I don’t think the next president is going to be a clone of [Faust], in the sense that an institution always benefits from some amount of change,” Graham said.

Republican former U.S. Representative Jason E. Chaffetz and former Obama aide Yohannes Abraham—both fellows at the Institute of Politics this semester—clashed over President Donald Trump’s decision to end a program protecting undocumented young people at an IOP panel Thursday evening.
The panel, billed as “Protests, Partisanship, & Fixing Politics: IOP Fellows Unplugged,” quickly turned to a tense debate over the discontinuation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
“I’m gonna go ahead and guess that you all will disagree with me on a number of things,” Chaffetz said. “I think that [DACA] is one of the better things that President Trump has done.”
Chaffetz and Abraham offered differing accounts of each party’s attempts at immigration reform, as Chaffetz lambasted the Democratic Senate under former President Barack Obama for blocking his immigration bill.
“It would have helped hundreds of thousands of people and it was as bipartisan as it could possibly be, and guess what? Word came back: the President and [Democratic Majority Leader] Harry Reid, they’re not going to let a Republican have a victory on immigration before the 2012 election, it’s not going to happen,” he said.
Abraham shot back that the Democratic Congress under Obama was “remarkably productive” in passing “priority legislation” and recovering from the 2008 financial crisis.
“I don’t think it’s going to come as a galloping shock to anyone in the room that Jason and I have a very different memory of the previous eight years,” Abraham said.
Later in the event, IOP fellow and President of the Congressional Institute Mark Strand spoke about American politics and voter sentiments more broadly, discussing the root causes of dissatisfaction with elected officials.
“There’s this anger at both parties, they see them playing for elections. So they’re not going to govern, they’re just going to angle for the next election,” Strand said.
Strand praised the “politics of consensus”—“We don’t do well split 50-50,” he said—and argued this kind of disengagement makes it more difficult to govern.
“We have to get back to a politics where we are trying to reach consensus, where we agree on what the problem is. Right now we are all acquiring our own sets of facts,” he said. “Everyone’s contributing to this problem whether it’s the media, whether it’s the politicians, whether it’s the voters…if we’re going to just fight with each other, the system will break.”
Weekly study group sessions with the resident fall fellows will be held Tuesday through Thursday this semester. The IOP will also host visiting fellows, including former Trump campaign aide Corey Lewandowski and “Morning Joe” hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough, throughout the semester.

UPDATED: September 8, 2017 at 10:33 a.m.
The Department of Education will review a series of Title IX guidelines that spurred Harvard and universities across the country to overhaul their response to sexual assault on campus, drawing concern from some anti-sexual assault activists at Harvard.
During a speech at George Mason University Thursday, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos said the department will reconsider the Obama-era policies after a public review process. Addressing a select group of invited students, DeVos called the Obama administration’s interpretation of the landmark anti-sex discrimination law a “failed system,” charging that Obama-era officials had pushed universities to “overreach” in enforcing Title IX.
“Schools have been compelled by Washington to enforce ambiguous and incredibly broad definitions of assault and harassment,” she said. “Too many cases involve students and faculty who have faced investigation and punishment simply for speaking their minds or teaching their classes.”
Current federal guidelines stem from a “Dear Colleague” letter former President Barack Obama’s administration issued in 2011. That letter called on educational institutions to consider sexual assault a violation of Title IX, and mandated that schools respond promptly to sexual assault complaints and adopt a “preponderance of the evidence” standard—a lower standard of proof than the one used in courts of law.
What a policy change might mean for Harvard remains unclear. Since the 2011 guidance, Harvard has established a University-wide Title IX office, unveiled a new policy, and appointed Title IX coordinators at each of its schools. In the ensuing years, the University also faced federal scrutiny; the Law School was found in violation of Title IX in 2014, and the College is still under investigation.
While University spokesperson Tania DeLuzuriaga reiterated Harvard’s commitment to addressing sexual assault in a statement Thursday, she declined to speculate about whether the the University may alter its approach to adjudicating sexual assault complaints down the line.
“Sexual harassment and sexual assault are significant and wrenching problems on college and university campuses across the country, including at Harvard,” University spokesperson Tania DeLuzuriaga wrote in a statement Thursday.
“With renewed focus over the past several years, Harvard has worked persistently to more effectively prevent sexual assault and other forms of sexual harassment, and to respond fairly and thoroughly to allegations when they arise,” she added.
Previously, after DeVos’ confirmation in February, Bill D. McCants, who directs Harvard’s Office for Dispute Resolution, said he did not anticipate a “course change” for Title IX enforcement at Harvard. And Deputy Provost Peggy E. Newell said a “relaxation in requirements” from the federal government would not alter the University’s commitment to addressing sexual assault.
But for others, DeVos’s speech forecast a significant step backwards in combating campus sexual assault. Student anti-sexual assault advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better issued a statement Thursday evening condemning DeVos’s decision and urging the University to take immediate action.
“While DeVos claims that she aims to provide justice for assailants on college campuses, in practice this revision merely serves to accommodate such groups’ desire to silence survivors of sexual violence,” the statement reads. “We call on Harvard to immediately confirm that it will not roll back its sexual assault policies in the face of federal backlash.”
Harvard Law professor Janet Halley—who is part of a group of Law School faculty who have repeatedly criticized Obama-era Title IX guidance—said she is pleased DeVos is seeking public input. Halley and three other Law School professors sent a memo to the Department of Education in August, urging the department to scale back its definition of sexual harassment.
“She’s going to go for public comment, which the previous administration never did on this issue. That’s more democratic and I think that’s a good thing,” Halley said, although she later added, “I am by no means declaring an alliance with the Trump administration.”
Stetson University Law professor and Title IX expert Peter F. Lake ’81 called DeVos’s remarks Thursday “a victory for due process”—and an expected one at that. During her confirmation hearing, DeVos indicated she would revisit the federal government’s approach to Title IX, and declined to commit to the 2011 guidelines. She spent the summer attending listening sessions with victims, accused students, and educators around the country.
“It’s not terribly surprising that after so many signals we got that the department appears to want to put more emphasis on due process and procedural safeguards,” Lake said.
The rulemaking process will likely last months and spark widespread debate, Lake said.
“This doesn’t promise to be an easy notice and comment period,” he said. “I would predict that the number of comments could easily be record-setting for the department.”

UPDATED: September 8, 2017 at 1:04 a.m.
After severe state budget cuts, Youth on Fire—a Harvard Square-based center for homeless youth—is at risk of shutting down at the end of the year if it does not receive more money from the government this month.
The drop-in center, which receives the majority of its funding from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health’s Office of HIV/AIDS, will come up $300,000 short in its budget this year after state funding cuts. That budget shortfall means the center will not last the year without additional support, its director of communications said.
“At this point, there is no funding to keep the organization open next year,” said Chris Viveiros, director of communications at the AIDS Action Committee, which runs Youth on Fire.
Youth on Fire provides meals, check-in conversations, and HIV tests—among other services—to over 3,000 primarily BGLTQ young adults since its founding, according to its website. The center is now waiting on a funding decision from the Department of Public Health that could determine whether the space remains operational through the end of this year.
“The Commonwealth recognizes the importance of Youth on Fire and looks forward to reviewing the proposal that the organization submitted to continue to provide infectious disease screening and support services for the homeless, the LGBTQ community and at-risk youths,” Ann Scales, a DPH spokesperson, wrote in an email.
Y2Y, a youth-aimed homeless shelter run by co-founders Sam G. Greenberg ’14 and Sarah A. Rosenkrantz ’14, released a press statement in June calling on Governor Charlie Baker to reinstitute Youth on Fire’s funds.
“Without their programming, many of our guests will not have a safe place to go during the day, and our ability to provide wraparound services will no longer exist. We will no longer be able to provide near-24 hour services in one location,” Greenberg wrote in an email in June.
Amid worries about the center’s closure, John, a 28-year-old who said he used Youth on Fire’s services from the ages of 22 to 25, said he is confident that the center will be able to find new sources of funding.
“It happens all the time,” he said. “As long as they get some big donations, they will be fine.”
Youth on Fire had a similar funding scare three years ago that galvanized the local community and city members to save the shelter, according to a statement from the AIDS Action Committee. In that instance, the Department of Public Health restored funding for Youth on Fire.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Friday September 8, 2017 at 12:54 a.m.
Close to a hundred Lowell House residents crowded into a narrow room on Thursday for their first afternoon tea of the academic year. Though Lowell Tea has been a fixture of the House’s culture since it first opened in 1930,  now, 77 years later, the tea is being hosted in a new space: the former Inn at Harvard.
Lowell House is currently undergoing a full-scale renovation as part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ more than $1 billion House Renewal project to modernize and enhance the upperclassmen residences. Lowell is the fifth House to be renovated and will be the first project to span two years.
Through May 2019, Lowell residents will live in several apartment-style buildings scattered throughout Harvard Square. Many of the House offices, the dining hall, and most sophomore suites are concentrated in the four-story Harvard Inn.
Adip Vora ’19-’20, a member of the Lowell House Committee, said Lowell administrators have done a “great job” adjusting to swing housing. He added, however, that organizing HoCo events may be more challenging given the space constraints of common spaces in swing housing.
“Swing housing is an obstacle to be surmounted for all of us. It’s great because the spaces themselves are beautiful, but they’re all kind of confined and small,” Vora said. “Creating events and planning events is going to be a little bit more tough.”
The constrained nature of common spaces in swing housing does not only affect House events, however. Due to the limited amount of seating and popular location of the Harvard Inn, Lowell has implemented stringent interhouse dining restrictions from the onset of their occupation.
No guests are allowed during lunch on weekdays, nor are they permitted to eat in Lowell during the peak dinner rush of 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday through Thursday. While Cabot students previously had special permission to eat at Lowell during lunch under a “sister House” agreement, Lowell House Faculty Dean Diana L. Eck said that arrangement may change depending on the volume of students at the dining hall in the Inn.
Like many of Lowell’s sophomores, Andrew G. Flannery ’20 lives in the Inn and said he enjoys his suite’s accommodations.
“Air conditioning is very nice,” Flannery said. “Lowell has really fostered a sense of community.”
Amrita S. Dani ’13, a Lowell resident tutor who also lived in the House as an undergraduate, said that despite the lack of common living spaces, Lowell’s House spirit remains strong.
“Tea is a big part of that and a big part of our traditions as a House that we’re continuing,” Dani said. “We’re working hard to build community despite a lack of common living space.”
Eck—who referred to the transition to swing housing as a “diaspora”—said she had a “high level of confidence” that community building will be smooth during renovations.
A few blocks deeper into Harvard Square, construction on Lowell House rumbles on. University spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven wrote in an email that “work on Lowell House is progressing on schedule.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson had exactly one chance, and it took full advantage.
On the shoulders of junior midfielder Leah Mohammadi’s third game-winning goal of the season, the Harvard women’s soccer team took down crosstown rivals Boston College on Thursday night, 1-0, for its third straight win and fourth shutout in five games. The Crimson (4-1) defeated the Eagles (4-3) for the first time in nearly 15 years.
What makes the victory especially remarkable was that Mohammadi’s goal was Harvard’s only shot-on-goal of the night. After a long midfield pass from senior defender Candy Janachowski got through two BC defenders, Mohammadi took a one-on-one with Eagles goalkeeper Alexis Bryant and finished in the top-right corner.
Bryant recorded one goal-against and zero saves, getting the loss on a night where BC got off 14 shots but came away each time empty-handed. Despite the Crimson recording zero other shots-on-goal the entire game, Mohammadi’s deft chip shot in the 70th minute stood until the final whistle.
“You need the defensive side of the game to come up strong in a game like this, where you know Boston College is going to be attacking,” Harvard coach Chris Hamblin said. “I think we were organized enough to be able to limit their clear-cut chances.”
The second half saw the Crimson backline—anchored by Janachowski, senior co-captain Marie Becker, and sophomore Kimaya Cole—run down every BC ball and deaden plays that could have turned into good chances.
Goalkeepers junior Danielle Etzel and sophomore Kat Hess, meanwhile, played in goal in the first and second halves, respectively, and turned away the balls that went on to become good chances. The two goalies combined for six saves and yet another shutout—all four of Harvard’s wins so far this year have been 1-0 shutouts.
“Our defending from top to bottom was fantastic,” Hamblin said. “Our goalkeepers did great when called upon, and both of them made some really big plays.”
Looking at the stat sheet alone wouldn’t tell you that the Crimson won, however.
BC outshot the home team 14-4 and were awarded ten corner kicks to Harvard’s two. Eight of the Eagles’ corner kicks came in the second half, setting the stage for a barrage of pressure that the Crimson defense was forced to buckle down and withstand. Despite BC’s high shot total and outpouring of what Hamblin calls “half-chances”, Harvard ultimately bent, but did not break.
“Our backline has been incredible for us this year,” Mohammadi said. “They don’t let anything past them…they’re so solid.”
On the other side of the pitch, Harvard was extremely opportunistic with the limited chances a very good BC team gave them. Mohammadi was very succinct in describing the winning play.
“Candy’s ball was incredible,” the goal-scorer said. “That was so good.”
Janachowski’s assist was her first of the season and the first point of her career, now entering her senior year. Mohammadi, meanwhile, now leads the team with three goals, surpassing her total from last year, with all three of them being game-winners (Providence, St. John’s, BC).
After the game, originally scheduled for Wednesday night, was postponed a day due to inclement weather, both teams came out Thursday night under the lights at Jordan Field with scrappy fighting play in the first ten minutes.
“We knew BC was going to be the best team that we’ve played so far,” Mohammadi said. “We were trying to find a happy medium between staying compact defensively and attacking [without] exposing ourselves too much.”
The victory extended the Crimson’s winning streak to three whilst breaking the Eagles’ three-game winning streak. In addition, no one has scored on Etzel and Hess in those three games, totaling 284-plus minutes. Several tough dazzling stops by both of them, even on well-struck shots, helped the defensive cause tremendously.
Shutting out BC was no easy task, as the Eagles had scored 10 goals in their previous three games.
Senior Dani Stollar and freshman Lauren Raimondo recorded a shot apiece, with Mohammadi taking two as well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard field hockey team wasn’t supposed to win the Ivy League title last fall. They weren’t supposed to beat Penn or even have a shot against Princeton. Yet, at the conclusion of the season, the Crimson stood alone atop the conference podium with an undefeated Ancient Eight record.
A year later, they’re doubted again.
In this year’s NCAA preseason rankings, Princeton was the highest-ranking Ivy League team at No. 8, while Harvard still broke the top 25 with a spot at No. 20. The rankings set the scene for another pseudo-Ivy League championship matchup between the two conference juggernauts, this time in Cambridge.
But the young Crimson team will have to dispose of the six other conference teams first.
“We also lost eight seniors last year, which was a big loss for our team, as they were an integral part of our success,” co-captain Ellie Cookson said. “However, we have seven new freshmen who are extremely talented and are bringing a lot to the table in different ways.”
Among the most noticeable losses for Harvard is forward Marissa Belleza, who made program history last season when she became the most successful scorer in program history. With 47 career goals, Balleza has the most career goals in program history and sits second in career goals per game.
“I think that the fact that our team is such a young and fresh team gives us the potential for major growth, and after the success of this past week in California," Cookson said. "I think it is obvious that even though the team is young, it will not hinder our ability to connect as a team and play the strongest that we can.”
Balleza was also more than just a goal-scorer—this year’s team will look to continue the culture of success that she brought to the program.
“Losing Marissa and all of our seniors was not just a loss to our team on the field but a loss of some truly amazing women who worked so hard to make Harvard field hockey what it is today,” junior forward Kathleen Young said. “They were instrumental in changing our team culture to be more competitive in the Ivy League and to win the championship.”
Several freshmen are already aiding in filling that gap. In a weekend trip to California, classmates Hannah Pearce and Mimi Tarrant picked up their first career points in a Crimson uniform.
“Our freshmen this year are all extremely talented and are already having a huge impact scoring-wise,” Young said. “Mimi Tarrant has been really fun to play with on the front line and has already scored some spectacular goals.”
Even having lost eight seniors, the team is not lacking talent. The Crimson returns seven starters and remains one of the top defensive teams in the nation.
Among those returning is junior goalkeeper Libby Manela. The Second-Team All-Ivy keeper returns from a 10-2 record and with a 1.42 goals-against average—the 14th best nationally.
Cookson, an All-Ivy Honorable Mention with a formidable passing game, returns as well. The co-captain dominated the assist game last season, racking up 10 to lead both the team and the conference. With 24 in her career, the senior is only three assists away from having the most in Harvard field hockey history.
In addition, midfielder Bente van Vlijmen will return for her second season as the top returning goal-scorer. Last year, the sophomore racked up eight goals, and as a Second Team All-American, was the only freshman in the country to earn a first or second team All-American nod.
Perhaps the most valuable returning member of the team isn’t a player at all, but Coach Tjerk van Herwaarden.
In only his sixth season at the helm of the program, Coach van Herwaarden already has had a successful tenure, having won an outright Ivy League title, made a NCAA tournament appearance, and tied the program record for most season wins.
“Coach van Herwaarden is extremely knowledgeable about the sport of field hockey,” Cookson said. “He knows the tactics and styles that work, and gives us the tools to implement them in our games. He also understands that we are student-athletes at one of the best schools in the world, and gives us the opportunity to explore all that Harvard has to offer, and makes sure we are getting the most out of our education.”
But that was last year. Now having won their first outright conference title since 1990, and on the heels of one of the best seasons in program history, the Crimson is looking for a repeat.
“I think that the success from last year gave us the confidence to know that we are good enough to compete very strongly in the Ivy League, and even nationally,” Cookson said. “However, we are not going to become complacent after last year's success, so we are working on establishing a new standard for Harvard field hockey that is going to be much competitive than before.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The third time might be the charm for the Harvard men’s soccer team (0-2, 0-0 Ivy League), which is still on the hunt for its first win of the season after being shut out twice during its opening weekend.
Saturday’s game will mark the third time that this Crimson team will face off with a team which it has never played before.
The team has not met Providence (2-2, 0-0 Big East) on the pitch since the 2013 season, meaning that for the current squad, it’s a completely new experience.
“Providence is a very good team this year, like Xavier and UMass Lowell,” sophomore midfielder Matthew Glass said. “We’re focused on getting into an attacking rhythm as well as doing our best to keep them away from our goal.”
In the last matchup, the Friars dominated for much of the game, answering a Harvard goal late in the first half and then going on to score twice more in the second half. Now the Crimson has a chance to respond to that loss with a win of its own.
Harvard goes into this match at Chapley Field in Providence, R.I., in a similar position as it did four years ago—with two losses and no wins. This time around, though, the team is completely different from what it was, and has different strengths and areas that it needs to work on.
“From the last games, especially the game against UMass Lowell, we thought that we did a lot better job at defending, so we’re really trying to work on attacking and creating chances,” co-captain Eric Gylling said.
The Crimson has a high-powered offense fueled by several players, including freshmen midfielder Paolo Belloni-Urso, who led the offense in shots taken in the home opener, midfielder Sebastian Lindner-Law, defender/forward Rory Conway, and defender/midfielder Fernando Doctors. Soon the offense will be bolstered by players returning from injury, when the team will be able to focus on increasing the pressure and putting points on the scoreboard.
“We just have to focus on continuing to create chances and then hopefully the goals will start coming,” Glass said. “In terms of the freshmen, each of them has done really well so far and are fighting for starting spots.”
On the defensive end, the back line led by Gylling, fellow co captains Justin Crichlow and senior goalie Kyle Parks remains solid. Parks has made a career-best six saves in both games, and Crichlow and Gylling, along with sophomores Joel Serugo and Gavin Baker-Greene and others, have helped keep pressure off Parks by making key tackles and clearances and setting offside traps for opponents.
Over the past couple of games, both offense and defense have begun to find a rhythm as the players—especially the freshmen—shake off their start-of-season jitters and build their confidence.
Though Harvard has worked on the difficulties that it has faced in the past two games, it will not be an easy feat to win on the road against a team that has also worked out the kinks and is currently enjoying a two-game win streak.
Like the Crimson, the Friars also boast a high-octane offense. The team has steadily upped its dominance in the attacking third and the number of shots on goal it takes. There have been different scorers in each game, including the third highest all-time scorer, redshirt senior Mac Steeves, who has scored three goals in the last two games.
Defensively, Providence has cleaned up its back line and appears to have settled on redshirt junior Colin Miller to be goalie after testing out two different goalies in the first two matches of the season. Miller allowed just one goal against URI and recorded a shutout against Bryant.
Harvard will have its work cut out for it against Providence, but it has adequately prepared and is poised to make a comeback and record a win before the end of its two-game road series.
“I think we’ll make the changes to our squad and that’s what we’ve been working on this week, so I think we’re pretty set going into Providence,” Gylling said.
