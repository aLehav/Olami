After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Being a man is difficult if you’ve never tried it before. Dressing up as the opposite sex is never enough to accurately reproduce the mindset of your character, and generations of actors who have switched genders on stage have had to deal with this conundrum. There is a wide spectrum of intention behind cross-dressing in theater: the actor has to decide whether they want to actually portray a member of the opposite sex, or just appear to be a man in a woman’s clothing. So much of our culture is tied up in stark delineations between the two sexes, and successful juggling of genders of the actor and  of the role is difficult without a very distinct artistic motive.
As I learned rehearsing for an all-female production of “The Taming of the Shrew,”the only thing harder than learning to walk like a man is learning to stand still like a man. When walking, you can focus on stiffening your shoulders or taking the rotation out of your hips: those are only for ladies and Latin dancers. Standing still, however, especially for long periods of time, is more of a challenge. “I think it honestly is a lot about having a penis,” says Olivia L. Ball ’14, who plays Petruchio in “Shrew However, it is also very tempting to rely on this anatomical novelty and swagger around with your pelvis stuck out, scratching and spitting. The propensity to fall into stereotype is one of the pitfalls of acting the opposite sex; most men—thankfully—don’t behave in the way that it’s easiest to portray them. Some of the aspects of male competitiveness were explained during “sock penis” rehearsals for the production as cast members produced a range of socks from anklets to knee-highs. “It makes a huge difference in how you act physically and emotionally,” says Ball of the prop penis. It changes the walk, the stance, and more nuanced body language, and therefore redefines the way an actor interacts with other characters. A deal of extraneous awkwardness is of course derived from the lack of attachment, which can at times change the new gait from swagger to limp.
“Another interesting thing that you need to keep in mind as a man is how you interact with women,” says director Simone E. Polanen ’14. A great deal of gender identity is centered in interactions with the opposite sex, and so this informs the characterization of male roles and often other actors’ portrayal of the female characters. “What often happens in a show that becomes all-female specifically is that the female characters, the people who should be female, become heightened,” says student director  Josh R. McTaggart ’13, a Crimson arts editor.  Indeed this is a potential danger to an all-female cast, as actors may be inclined to increase their femininity in a kind of arms race with female performers in male roles.
Certainly in Shakespeare’s time all roles were written for male actors, and women were usually portrayed by younger boys in female clothing. As a result, the gender of characters—particularly female character—can be a significant feature of their lines and interactions. “A lot of what you can use is in the language, because Shakespeare was writing for men even when it was a female part.” says Morgan Goldstein, an MFA candidate in Dramaturgy and Teaching Fellow for Dramatic Arts 115: Acting Shakespeare. Changing the gender of the performer but not the role—which Goldstein calls “real disguise”—has become less common in contemporary theatre and usually only occurs in productions with a single sex cast. For example, shows put on by Shakespeare’s Globe in London, which aims to give a realistic portrayal of the Elizabethan theatrical experience, frequently puts on plays with exclusively male casts.
It is the instinctive identification of the sexes that makes gender swap such an effective theatrical device. However, to successfully achieve this effect, actors must suppress the gender identity they have been conditioned to have normally, and in the process convincingly challenge the audience’s own preconceptions of gender.

Over the past few weeks, I have found it nearly impossible to watch any video on YouTube without first being assaulted by an attack ad from the campaign of either Elizabeth Warren or Scott Brown. With control of the Senate hanging in the balance, this fiercely contested race has garnered more coverage than almost any other in the country. There is no doubt that the outcome of this race will have a huge impact on whether the next president will be able to carry out his agenda effectively. Yet travel a few hours north, and you will encounter a Senate race that just might have a more long lasting impact.
When Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) announced her retirement last February, political commentators mourned the loss of a moderate stalwart in the Senate. Throughout her tenure, Senator Snowe always stood for pragmatism and bi-partisanship, even forming a part of the Gang of 14, the group of senators that successfully ended the gridlock over President Bush’s nominees to the Supreme Court. It was the growth of this very same gridlock that Senator Snowe cited as the reason for her departure. As a moderate Republican in the Senate, the senator was a member of a very small club, one that seemed to get smaller every election cycle. The rise of the Tea Party made targets out of Republican senators who strayed from conservative principles and made a habit of reaching across the aisle (gasp!). This new trend ended the political careers of several Republican senators, including Dick Lugar (R-Ind.) and the late Arlen J. Specter (R-Penn.), both moderates who lost tight primary races against more conservative opponents. In left-leaning Maine, however, Senator Snowe was virtually guaranteed re-election, which only serves to show just how inhospitable the Senate had become to moderates like her.
Fortunately, soon after her announcement, a candidate entered the race that promised to continue Senator Snowe’s legacy of moderation. With less than a week before Election Day, Angus King, the mustachioed former governor of the state, seems a lock to be the next Senator from Maine. Running as an Independent, King has the potential to be even more bipartisan than his predecessor. His positions show that he might be a true maverick in the Senate in the mould of John McCain before his turn to the right in the 2008 campaign left the term devoid of almost all meaning. On healthcare, King backs Obama’s reform, but concedes that it could use improvements. On financial reform, he has come out against the Dodd-Frank Act, which the President touts on the campaign trail as one of his most important achievements. After serving as governor, King co-founded a wind power company and served on the board of directors of a natural gas engineering company, showing his commitment to an energy policy that makes use of a diversity of sources.
On the most important issue that will face the next Congress, King has taken a responsible position by endorsing the Simpson-Bowles commission report as the basis for any meaningful fiscal reform. One of the co-chairs of the commission, Erskine B. Bowles, has endorsed King saying that he is in “a unique position to bridge the partisan divide and negotiate a solution to the debt crisis.”
Beyond policies, King’s calm demeanor could also help cool our nation’s political rhetoric. His campaign ads conspicuously lack the ominous voiceover that seems to be the staple of most ads this election season. When Republican-affiliated groups attacked his record as governor, King did not respond in kind. Instead, he aired an ad in which he looked directly at the camera and reassured voters that he is not the Godzilla portrayed by attacks against him. In fact, all of King’s ads follow the same simple formula: just him in front of a camera speaking to voters. His ads do not feature any soundtracks, photo ops, or any other clichés of the political ad genre.
King, however, will face some difficulties due to his Independent status. Unless he caucuses with whichever party ends up in the majority (more likely than not, the Democrats), it is unlikely that he will receive his favored committee assignments. He will have to avoid the temptation of locking himself into a partisan label, so that he can more effectively bring the ever more divided Senate closer together. King has already shown that he is willing to fill this role through his pledge to work on a reform of the filibuster, the Senate parliamentary rule that often brings the parties to an impasse.
With the average poll giving King a fifteen-point lead over his Republican opponent, it seems voters in Maine will continue their tradition of sending moderates to the Senate. Olympia Snowe’s retirement, which at first seemed like a tragedy, just might be a blessing in disguise. Come January, King will bring a new centrist vigor to the Senate. We can only hope that the rest of Congress will be inspired by King’s independence and come together to solve the serious problems that our nations faces.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Crimson does not approve of hurricanes or tropical storms. This past Sunday night, Hurricane Sandy posed a serious inconvenience to those who attended The Harvard Crimson’s editorial board meeting. Wind and rain forced students to don a level of raingear perhaps not seen on Harvard students since the revelries of the University’s 375th anniversary. It was quite unpleasant, but thankfully we had some sturdy buildings to keep us safe. These buildings serve as a physical reminder of the many collective institutions and stores of cumulative knowledge without which we would be much worse off.
First of all, we must congratulate the Crimson staff of years past for their wisdom in not locating our offices outdoors. The decision to provide housing for our newspaper was a truly wise one. We only regret that our predecessors did not have the aesthetic sensibilities to style our building’s façade in the neo-romanesque fashion.
However, at a time when our nation’s political dialogue is largely concerned with who built what, we must acknowledge that those Crimson editors did not build our newspaper’s offices themselves. Even Howard Roark couldn’t have built it himself. It is impossible not be struck by the massive amount of people who deserve commendation for giving us shelter from the storm.
It goes without saying that the Commonwealth’s public infrastructure must have been vital for builders, architects and construction material to all find their way to 14 Plympton Street. It is heartening to see that $1.651 billion has been allocated toward infrastructure, housing, and economic development in this upcoming year’s state budget for Massachusetts. Hopefully this will result in increased office space for the staff of many more of this state’s college newspapers.
Perhaps most crucially, this building, and the various public works that facilitated its construction, would not have been possible without a long line of innovations in the field of architecture. We must thank those daring Neolithic ancestors of ours who first saw the prudence in erecting structures to house themselves and who continue to inspire us to this day. The Knap of Howar still stands, and so does our admiration for its architect. In the silver-grey bricks of this sturdy Scottish homestead, it is hard not to see a direct ancestor of Winthrop House.
It is fitting that, when faced with an act of God, we are best able to appreciate how we continue to benefit from the most enduring acts of humanity. We urge God to reconsider sending hurricanes and tropical storms our way. In the meantime, we urge humankind to continue building.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In case you didn’t notice during class selection this fall, female professors are a bit scarce at Harvard. In fact, women continuously hold many fewer higher-level positions and tenure than men at elite universities. Harvard’s most recent Faculty Trends report states, “Over the last four years women have made up between 25 and 26 percent of the ladder faculty. With respect to rank, women currently represent 22 percent of tenured faculty and 36 percent of tenure-track faculty.” In short, women consistently make up about one fifth of tenured faculty, even though they represent about one third of those eligible for it. They aren’t just underrepresented in academia; they are also underrepresented among tenured academics. (The statistics on minorities, which deserve an opinion piece of their own, are equally unrepresentative of the population of the United States.) Of course, the idea that this gender imbalance is a problem rests on two premises: that we should have higher numbers of elite women academics, and that we don’t because of discrimination or bias—something systematically unfair.
The first seems practically self-evident to this particular Harvard student for the very basic, almost simplistic reason that I like having female professors. I see myself in them; their success encourages me. I can ask them to dinner without feeling awkward. On a purely anecdotal level, they show a lot more interest in my wellbeing. But beyond my feelings on the matter, it is obvious that women have half the minds of this world, and their apparent exclusion thus likely means worse scholarship. Such exclusion appears likely knowing that the problem extends to women who are already brilliant and accomplished enough to be tenure-tracked at Harvard.
So why are there so few female professors at Harvard and comparable institutions?
Naturally some of the problem is clearly that women bear children, and this particularly disrupts things like writing books. However welcomed, pregnancies are medical conditions, and sometimes rather serious ones. Nevertheless, men parent newborns too. What they can’t do at Harvard—and many other places in the U.S.—is take the same amount of time off after the birth of a child. Women are granted an extra thirteen weeks for medical leave, which accommodates biological necessity, but it as well encourages couples to economize their time out of work so that women are out for longer periods. On top of that, it seems that male academics are less likely to take the paternity leave they are entitled to, and when they do take it they are more likely to use it to write articles rather than change diapers.
Both biology and social norms are therefore major factors in why so many more men than women become elite academics. But that doesn’t mean that nothing can be done to change the weight these factors have or that no structural changes would create a more equitable environment. Remember the buzz-generating article “Why Women Still Can’t Have it All” by Anne-Marie Slaughter? Midway through, she took the time to explain a simple change in tenure policy at Princeton. Previously, Princeton had allowed assistant professors of any gender to take an extension on their tenure clock whenever they had a child. Essentially this gave them extra time to rack up publications and other accomplishments before they were reviewed for tenure. Despite the policy, almost no one used this extension, possibly because the assistant professors were unlikely to predict benefits from the extension, or perhaps because they felt taking the extension would look bad and hurt their eventual chances for tenure. As a result, the gender imbalance persisted. Then, in 2005, “Princeton changed the default rule. The administration announced that all assistant professors, female and male, who had a new child would automatically receive a one-year extension on the tenure clock, with no opt-outs allowed. Instead, assistant professors could request early consideration for tenure if they wished. The number of assistant professors who receive a tenure extension has tripled since the change.”
It’s still early to see how much this will affect the tenure rates of male and female faculty members, but it’s certainly a start. Most importantly, we can’t simply have a defeatist attitude toward a situation that makes it much harder to be a female academic, creates a discouraging atmosphere for female students, and potentially keeps some of the most intelligent professors out of Harvard because they are women. My mother always said of the balance between family and work, “You can have it all, but you can’t have it all at once.” This should be equally true for women and men.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I grew up in the tropics of South Florida, where hurricanes and summer go together like salt and pepper or arroz and pollo. I used to keep a list of all storm names taped to the fridge and would cross them off, one by one, when they passed. But no matter how severe the storm, I would always be reminded that it was nothing like Hurricane Andrew, the monstrosity that tore Miami apart in August 1992. Andrew survivors can still be identified by their t-shirts that say, “I SURVIVED HURRICANE ANDREW” and the fact that, at every possible moment, they remind anyone they happen to be talking to that no matter how painful a hernia is or how much waiting in line at the DMV sucks, Andrew was worse. “It was like ‘Nam, man,” they tell us.
These days, hurricanes bring with them TV spinmeisters and newspaper columnists who, on account of having survived the previous year’s hurricane season, suggest to us that their survival advice is more useful than battery-operated television sets or, for that matter, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “Be sure to close your front door before the storm hits!” they suggest helpfully. “This could be the next Andrew! Don’t forget to stock up on bottled water and python nets! Most importantly, have an ample supply of bananas—there could be feral monkeys on the loose!”
Of course, these same pundits and writers conclude, after the hurricane has passed, that the storm was a whole to-do about nothing. “’Tis but a scratch,” they write. “Just a flesh wound. I’ve seen worse.” These individuals proceed to blame the media for dramatizing a drizzle, and calm returns until the following week, when another two storms threaten to rustle some palm fronds. “This one really could be the next Andrew!” they bellow. “Don’t be the boy who cried wolf! Make sure to shut your front door before the storm hits!”
Having endured this ordeal every summer for my entire childhood, I thought I would escape it all by heading north for college. But, as luck would have it, storms have a funny tendency to follow me to the far reaches of habitable terrain. Last year, Irene threatened to dump as much as half an inch of rain on Boston, and this year Sandy gave us quite a scare. As a Florida native who survived too many storm seasons, I feel obligated to impart to my faithful northern readers some advice and wisdom regarding hurricanes.
First and foremost, in the event of a storm, be sure to shut all doors and windows. This advice is particularly salient if a hurricane brings with it rain, wind, or monkeys. Second, federal law dictates that supplies may be purchased only on the day preceding the storm, and must be thrown away immediately afterward. I used to think the law applied only to Florida residents, but recently learned that it is, in fact, a federal regulation, explaining why half of the eastern seaboard went shopping for flashlights on Sunday.
New York City, the reports indicate, had more than its fair share of flying projectiles. One early report indicated that all of Long Island blew into lower Manhattan, causing a large brawl regarding the proper lox-to-bagel ratio for hurricane rations. (The verdict was a single slice of lox per bagel, due to a shortage of salmon.) The City, by all accounts, was absolutely devastated by Sandy. And it is such a shame—the only thing more depressing than living in a state bordering New Jersey is the possibility of a giant dangling crane falling on your head. Now, the rest of the nation turns its eyes to the City to learn, once and for all, how to repair a crane that snapped in half like a toothpick.
All kidding aside, New York will rebuild, bigger and better than before. I by no means mean to minimize the tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers are with those poor souls in the tri-state area, but surely if there is any city in the world that can regroup and rebuild better than before, it is New York City. The buildings will continue to grow and the concrete jungle will bloom once again. Until then, though, New Yorkers will have to settle for the inevitable “I SURVIVED HURRICANE SANDY” t-shirts and pundits telling them how important it was to close their front doors before the storm.
To my compatriots in Boston who have weathered the storm with me—‘twas but a flesh wound.
To my friends and family in Manhattan—I hope you all stocked up on bananas.

In the new online social media world, when gastronomes explore a new restaurant, they might enter a review on Yelp.com. Now, MyFairElection.com, a website founded by Harvard Kennedy School professor Archon Fung, allows voters to do a similar thing: review their experiences at the polls.
On the site, voters can rate their polling experience on a five-star scale; these reviews will chronicle general voter satisfaction.
Voters can note polling offices for broken machines, voter intimidation, and wait times. Fung said he hopes the website, which launched Oct. 17, will improve voter experience and increase voter participation across the U.S.
“I got my motivation from looking at the 2000 election—how close it was and the dispute over whether people even got the basic right to vote,” said Fung, who calls MyFairElection the “Yelp for Democracy.”
“You would think that in 2012 the quality of the democracy would allow everyone to vote very easily,” he said.
Earlier this year, Fung worked with Hollie Russon-Gilman, a graduate student in the government department, to revamp the website from its initial version in 2008.
Russon-Gilman said she was inspired to help with the project, after some states passed increased requirements for voter identification, a regulatory shift that experts have said might disenfranchise some voters.
“This can make it very difficult to know the proper documentation to bring,” she said.
With MyFairElection, voters can report such problems; this feedback will be available to other voters and anyone else who requests it, including state and local officials, journalists, citizen activists, and party representatives.
Voters can also anonymously provide comments or submit pictures of their polling place, which are available to the public. The results are compiled in real-time to create a map showing the quality of voting experiences for each region.
Karen Suhaka, founder and president of LegiNation, is optimistic that the information collected by MyFairElection will encourage election officials to make improvements.
LegiNation is one of the organizations that supported the development of the website.
“Hopefully we’ll be able to compile a list of do’s and don’ts that we can share, as well as make some introductions for the good people to mentor the less successful people,” she said. “I also think that just knowing they are being watched, measured, and reported on will help.”
Looking ahead, Fung said he hopes his website will inspire other people to expand the project in future elections to reach the maximum number of voters possible. “I hope we will actually have a good idea of the quality of election administration all over the United States,” Fung said.
Since the website’s launch in mid-October, the site has received roughly 1,000 visitors who have given feedback.
“It has been overwhelmingly positive so far,” Suhaka said. “It’s something people really think should exist.”

No matter who wins the upcoming presidential election, change is coming to the U.S. health care system, according to former U.S. Senator Thomas A. Daschle who gave a lecture at Harvard Medical School on Tuesday.
“I am reluctant to say this, but I have to acknowledge the truth of it: [health reform] is going to happen regardless of who’s elected president,” Daschle, who is a Democrat, said. “There is going to be a dramatic transformation [in health care] over the next ten years one way or the other.”
In his lecture entitled “The Affordable Care Act: A New Paradigm for Health in America,” Daschle forecasted “inexorable” and “near-term” improvements in transparency, information, and quality.
The event was the HMS Department of Health Care Policy’s 12th Annual Marshall J. Seidman Lecture on Health Policy. Past lecturers include former U.S. Senator William H. Frist and former Harvard President Lawrence H. Summers.
The former Senate majority leader from South Dakota discussed the partisan disagreement surrounding the role of government and identified the “tests” that the Affordable Care Act has and will face. Daschle said that even if Obama is re-elected, the Affordable Care Act will continue to be challenged in the courts and in the legislature. He also anticipated challenges in the implementation of the Act’s reforms.
Daschle closed his lecture by contrasting the politicized character of health care policy and the insulated nature of monetary policy.
“Unfortunately, health care policy-making in this country has become so politicized and so complex that, just like our monetary system, I honestly don’t think that Congress has the capacity on a daily basis to manage it,” Daschle said. “I believe that we need to create a ‘Health Fed,’ a body that allows thoughtful decision making with the opportunity for Congress to override any decision they don’t like.”
During the question and answer portion of the lecture, Daschle called on the work of health care policy lecturer Donald M. Berwick ’68, who was asked to provide perspective on physician leadership in implementing health care reform.
“I think we know what better care looks like,” Berwick said. “We actually know how to give better care at lower cost, but it’s a matter of will and follow-through, and execution and change.”
When asked whether he believed the relationship between Congress and the Executive Office would improve in the next four years, Daschle noted the barriers of partisan politics. However, he said that he remains optimistic.
“The election allows for a new stage to be constructed, upon which different scenarios can play themselves out,” said Daschle. “I do think there is an opportunity for a new dialogue.”
After the lecture, Berwick said that Daschle added an important perspective to the discussion about the Affordable Care Act.
“You had a very sophisticated politcal expert talking about the inevitability of change,” Berwick said following the lecture. “[Daschle] sees as I see it: tectonics of health care change in the next decade are going to play out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four candidates for Undergraduate Council president and their vice presidential running mates have garnered the signatures necessary to run in the upcoming election, the UC Election Commission announced in an e-mail late Monday.
The presidential candidates­—Michael C. George ’14, Spenser R. Goodman ’14, Tara Raghuveer ’14, and Akshay M. Sharma ’14—will officially begin campaigning on Nov. 7.
Raghuveer, this year’s only female presidential candidate, serves as the UC’s Vice Chair of the Student Relations Committee. During her time on the committee, she has focused on improving communication between the University and students. She also serves as a UC liaison to the Institute of Politics and as a representative on the Student Faculty Committee for Campus Safety.
Beyond the UC, Raghuveer is involved with the Crimson Key, Hasty Pudding Theatricals, and is a former Crimson FM writer.
She is joined by running mate Jen Q. Y. Zhu ’14, a UC veteran who joined as a freshman.
Akshay Sharma and his vice presidential candidate Akanksha Sharma ’14 promise to confuse students with their similar names and backgrounds. Both live in Cabot House, although they are not blockmates, are members of Crimson Key, and serve as Peer Advising Fellows.
Akanksha Sharma clarified in an email that the two “are not siblings, not dating, not twins, and definitely not spouses. But they are great friends.”
The two bring UC experience and public service to their ticket. Akshay Sharma serves as the UC’s Gender Parity Representative, and Akanksha Sharma has served on the Finance and Student Life Committees.
Goodman, a representative since freshman year and the chair of the Social Programs Committee, has focused on improving social life on campus. He planned last year’s all-school dance and helped bring the cast of Buried Life to campus.
For the past two years Goodman has served as Yardfest chair for the College Events Board. He is also a member of the varsity swim team. Goodman is joined by running mate Darren C. McLeod ’14.
George, who is also a Crimson news editor, has served for two years as a member of the UC executive board. He currently chairs the Committee on Student Life where he has focused on creating social space and working with the administration to improve the student experience.
This year, George and his committee fought to expand Lamont library’s hours during reading and exam period, a change the administration announced they would make earlier this month.
Running alongside George is VP candidate Nicole E. Granath ’15, the only UC outsider in this race.
Campaigning, which was originally to begin on Nov. 5, has been moved back by two days in light of the Nov. 6 U.S. Presidential election, according to the UC Election Commission. Online voting is slated to open on Nov. 12 and close on Nov. 15.

When Hurricane Sandy battered Harvard Square, Cambridge businesses were forced to reassess their usual consumer priorities.
While some Harvard Square staples experienced regular levels of patronage, others found their decisions to close early or not open at all worthwhile.
“In the morning, we were very slow, so it was a good decision,” said Christopher Hogan, general manager of Panera Bread, which closed early at 1 p.m..
Many businesses decided to close early due to the suspension of MBTA services after 2 p.m. on Monday. “We were really affected by the T closure. Employees had to leave early and those who had cars or could walk came in,” said Bill Mahoney, the store manager at CVS.
Managers also attributed closing to employee safety concerns, taking precautions due to the state of emergency.
Denise A. Jillson, executive president of the Harvard Square Business Association, said that there had been no reports of damage to stores. “I think the city was incredibly prepared,” she said.
Two late-night staples of the Square, Pinocchio’s and Felipe’s, experienced contrasting levels of business on Monday. Jerry Panza, a longtime worker at Noch’s, said that the eatery had been busy all day. However, both of Thomas J. Brush’s businesses, Felipe’s and Flat Patties, remained open but stayed relatively quiet.
“I expected more people to come out exploring and experiencing the storm,” Brush said.
Brush decided to close both of his eateries an hour early. Other businesses, including the Harvard Square Book Store, chose to close due to the MBTA suspension while observing low foot traffic. “The head buyer said it was the quietest she’d seen the store in the 10 years that she has worked here,” said Brad Lennon, assistant manager.
But like Noch’s, some other businesses experienced normal or even above average levels of business.
Convenience stores CVS and Tommy’s Value found themselves as busy as usual. Sales were also bolstered Sunday by hordes of students preparing for the storm. The managers of these businesses and others in the Square chose to stay open because of the expectation that they would.
Jaime Leonard, the dining room manager of Russell House Tavern, said, “As a restaurant staple in Harvard Square we have to stay open, so that our customers know that they can depend on us.”
Indeed after Lisa C. Yao ’13 realized she had missed dining hall hours, she relied on the fact that certain Square businesses would be open despite the storm. Finding out that Border Cafe and Yenching were both open, Yao ultimately chose to venture to the closer option, Yenching, for her dinner.
“I didn’t think [the storm] was that bad,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard students braced themselves for “Frankenstorm” Sandy by stocking up on food and water at CVS, and the College announced the cancellation of classes, the administrators at the Office of Career Services faced another difficult task Sunday evening: how to handle the 106 On-Campus Interviews scheduled for Monday.
The inclement weather and the difficulties it presented for those traveling to campus forced OCS to reschedule many of the interviews originally planned for Monday and Tuesday for students participating in the OCS Recruiting Program. Seventy-five students had interviews scheduled on Monday alone.
“[Employers] want to come through rain or sleet or snow to interview Harvard students,” said Deborah Carroll, the associate director for employer relations and operations. “But sometimes airlines and Amtrak don’t agree with them.”
Nine employers were scheduled to conduct interviews early this week, including Dropbox, Opera Solutions, and Brookshire Capital.
In addition to rescheduling interviews, OCS postponed all employer presentations on Monday and Tuesday, including those from companies such as Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse.
Prior to the University’s announcement that all but essential operations would be suspended, OCS had offered recruiters who were in town the option of conducting face-to-face interviews, according to Carroll.
After the University’s announcement, Carroll said OCS amended their policy and asked the employers to offer students the option of following through with the interviews if they felt comfortable going outside.
Though many employers could not conduct interviews due to difficulty travelling in and out of New York City and Boston, some still chose to conduct Skype and phone interviews.
Others companies, like Dropbox, still continued to hold their interview sessions.
Students who came out to the interview facility early Monday morning were happy with their decision to attend, grateful for the opportunity to focus on their job search in the absence of classes, Carroll said.
Though coordinating such a large number of students has been difficult for OCS, Carroll said that they have managed to reschedule most of the interviews by early next week. She added that students did not appear to be exceptionally distressed by the change of plans.
“I think it reassured people when we told them that they wouldn’t have to wait very long before the rescheduled interview,” Carroll said.
The employer presentations, however, will most likely be held after Thanksgiving, Carroll said, well before the On-Campus Interview program’s first application deadline on Jan. 16.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The young woman who was arrested on Sunday night for trespassing in the Lowell dining hall returned to Harvard’s campus and was found in an Eliot House bathroom on Tuesday morning.
Eliot House Master Gail A. O’Keefe sent an email to Eliot residents informing them of the incident on Tuesday.
In her email, O’Keefe stated that the woman was found after reportedly having spent the night in a bathroom in Eliot.
Following the issuance of a no trespass warning when the 17-year-old woman visited Gund Hall, Weld Hall, and Leverett House, she was escorted from Harvard property three more times in the past week. Lowell House Master Diana L. Eck also said in an email to her House that the young woman is suspected of stealing.
According to the Harvard University Police Department police log, the woman was arrested in the Lowell dining hall on Sunday night. In an email to Lowell House residents on Monday afternoon, Eck said that the woman returned again on Monday and was escorted away from Harvard property.
“Residential staff are familiar with the individual and have been instructed to call the HUPD immediately upon witnessing her on University property,” according to an email from HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano.
Catalano wrote that HUPD “does not feel that the woman in question poses a threat to the campus.”
O’Keefe reiterated Catalano’s sentiment, saying that she did not believe the young woman “poses a threat to [students’] personal safety.” However, she still encouraged Eliot residents to be more cautious when entering buildings and to question people who may try to follow them into residential buildings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although Hurricane Sandy interrupted all but core Harvard University operations Monday, the so-called superstorm was no match for Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Ph. D candidate Mollie A. Woodworth. As Hurricane Sandy brewed outside, Woodworth defended her dissertation to her examination committee inside Bauer Labs.
“Thesis defense is sort of like a wedding. You plan for a really, really, really long time, but then you kind of can’t control what happens on the actual day,” said Woodworth, who became Dr. Woodworth after the approval of her dissertation on Monday.
Yesterday’s date was agreed upon by Woodworth and her dissertation committee in the early summer. This committee consisted of three Harvard faculty members—Molecular and Cellular Biology professor Joshua R. Sanes, Harvard Medical School professor Connie Cepko, and HMS Professor Gabriel Corfas—and University of Washington neurobiology surgery professor Robert Hevner. The committee reviewed Woodworth’s dissertation on the two genes that control the development of the cerebral cortex.
Upon boarding his Boston-bound flight in Seattle on Sunday, Hevner was informed that the plane might not be able to make it all the way to Boston and, even if it did, he would likely be unable to return home on time.
He decided to take the risk.
Soon after, he found out in an email that his flight home, scheduled for Monday afternoon, had been cancelled and is grounded until Wednesday night.
For Hevner's dedication to getting to Boston, Woodworth called him“the hero” of the day.
Hevner and Woodworth both pointed out the difficulty of getting the busy faculty examiners all in the same room on the same date.
“My committee was wonderful. They never suggested that we should reschedule,” said Woodworth.
While her family from Ohio made it to the defense, some of Woodworth’s friends and colleagues were unable to attend due to the violent weather. But the hurricane freed some of her lab members from their responsibilities, allowing them to attend.
Christopher A. Devine ’13, who works in the same lab as Woodworth, originally could not be present because of a medical school interview, but it was cancelled because of the hurricane.
“Mollie was one of the grad students who was the friendliest welcoming me into the lab freshman year,” said Devine.
“She was really calm,” he said of her performance during the defense.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Edith C. Benavides ’14 stood before the Undergraduate Council’s general meeting last month, clutching a camera and a rainbow flag. Benavides was there to take a photo of the Council for an upcoming celebration of National Coming Out Day.
She gave her standard introduction: Hi, my name is Edith, I’m an intern at the BGLTQ Office. My preferred gender pronouns are she, her, and hers.
To her surprise, Benavides was greeted by a chorus of snickers from the left half of the room.
“I had never gotten that reaction when I mentioned my preferred gender pronouns before,” said Benavides. “It lasted only two seconds, but I paused afterwards because I was so shocked.”
UC President Danny P. Bicknell ’13 said he immediately noticed the laughter. He said he explained gender pronouns to the representatives and told them that “it is never appropriate” to react in that manner.
“My experience personally showed me that it’s not all rainbows and smiles,” Benavides said. “I am in a world that is not entirely knowledgeable about things like this, and I have to be able to learn and teach.”
Lack of awareness is not unusual at the College, where students who fit outside the gender binary often have to explain that they would like to be referred to with a name or pronoun which may not reflect their assigned sex.
For these students, their preferred gender pronoun, or PGP, as it is often abbreviated, is not just a matter of preference; it’s a matter of identity.
Now, as the number of trans-identified students and staff on campus becomes more visible than it has been in recent years, the College is starting to take notice. Students say that the Harvard community has generally been receptive to incorporating preferred pronouns into icebreakers, and that this may pave the road for heightened sensitivity to broader trans issues.
PRONOUN PROGRESS
Jamie, a senior at the college who asked that their last name not be used so that future employers cannot discriminate against them based on their gender identity, decided to try on a gender-neutral name after hearing other students talk about their own identities.
“During coming out narratives, people were sharing stories and were very affirming of how they felt, coming out as trans,” Jamie said. “I realized that gender wasn’t this binary thing that I’d been thinking about.”
Jamie now prefers the non-gendered pronoun “they.”
According to Assistant Dean for Student Life Emelyn A. dela Peña, a PGP is “simply the pronoun that a person would like others to use when talking to or referring to that person.”
The pronoun reflects a person’s gender identity—the inner feeling of being a man or a woman, neither, or somewhere in between.
Someone’s gender identity may be different from the gender assigned at birth—the biological sex of a newborn as perceived by physicians, and, therefore, the gender that child is raised as—or from sex, which is a combination of hormonal, genital, and secondary-sex characteristics.
Furthermore, someone’s gender identity may or may not coincide with expression of gender, which can be anywhere on the spectrum of masculine and feminine. It is also separate from sexuality or sexual orientation, which signifies the gender to which a person is attracted.
In addition to the pronoun sets of “he/him/his” and “she/her/hers,” individuals may also prefer to be referred to with the gender-neutral pronouns “they/them/theirs” or “ze/hir/hirs,” or simply by name.
Individuals who identify outside the binary of man and woman may identify as any number of terms under the transgender umbrella, including genderqueer or gender-fluid. The trans rights movement has coined the term “cisgender” for people whose gender identities and expressions match the gender they were assigned at birth. The word comes from the Latin prefix “cis”—the antonym of “trans”—which means “on the same side as.”
For Jamie, this language was crucial in articulating their identity.
“I don’t want surgery. It’s not a body dysmorphic thing; it’s a gender presentation thing,” Jamie said. “I knew my gender presentation was atypicaI, but I didn’t have the language to express that when I was 10.... It’s only recently that I realized that I’d rather have a positive identity as something in-between than always react against traditional male or female identity.”
For some students, regardless of the pronouns they prefer, fluidity in gender expression is key to their identity.
“There are some days when I really want to pass as male, but there are some days when I really want to pass as female,” said Madeline O. Studt ’16, who is open to all pronouns. “Then, there are certain days when I really don’t care.”
Studt, for instance, chooses to wear a tuxedo when performing with Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum, a musical group in which men traditionally wear tuxedos and women wear black dresses.
Students said it can be difficult to share their PGP, particularly in a room full of people who are cisgender.
“Changing your pronouns is a brave thing to do,” said Linda M. Buehler ’14, a lesbian student. “It’s a way of outing yourself to people you don’t even know.”
ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTION
“Pronouns are something that we use just as often as names,” said Alex, a trans-identified junior who prefers the pronoun “they.”
Alex, whose name was changed by The Crimson because their parents do not know that they are trans, said that learning people’s preferred pronouns “should be just as important as learning [what name] somebody would want to be called.”
For students who do not adhere to the male/female gender binary, acknowledging their PGP is a sign of respect.
“The practice of asking someone their PGP destabilizes the idea that gender just is—that it should be something that is in accordance with your biology, your genitalia, or whatever else society thinks it should be in accordance with,” said Jake, a transgender senior whose name was changed by The Crimson because he said he wants to live as a man in the future without people knowing his gender history. “It’s respectful, and it makes gender-variant members of the community more comfortable.”
The idea of expressing a non-binary gender is not new. In some Native American communities, “Two-Spirit” individuals were revered, and in other societies around the world, individuals with non-binary genders are an important part of the social fabric. But in 21st-century America, asking for preferred pronouns in public spaces is unusual.
Though many are unsure whether or how to ask people about their PGP, Jonas Q. Wang ’12 says the best option is to simply ask.
“It’s just like, ‘What’s your name?’ Follow it up with, ‘What’s your PGP?’” said Wang, a former co-chair of Harvard College Queer Students and Allies who is transgender. “There’s no one approach everyone follows, and it won’t be awkward if you don’t make it awkward. As long as you’re respectful and kind, the rest should follow.”
Even when students are introduced to a person’s preferred pronouns, making the switch for someone they have known by a different pronoun can be a difficult adjustment.
Brianna J. Suslovic ’16 said she had to consciously make an effort to use the correct pronouns when a friend recently transitioned to male pronouns.
“It was a lot of slipping up and correcting myself when referring to him in the beginning,” she said.
But Alex said that they value even a friend who refers to them with an outdated pronoun if that friend acknowledges the mistake.
“Whenever someone says ‘I’m really sorry if I slip up, but I’m trying,’ I almost feel like I’m going to cry,” Alex said. “It’s so rare to hear [someone acknowledging their mistakes] here.”
HOUSE, YEAR, PGP
“When I first arrived on campus, trans issues weren’t really on the radar unless you were in the BGLTQ community,” Wang said. “And even in the BGLTQ community, it wasn’t really on the radar unless you were interested in trans issues.”
Wang said that while he and his friends used their preferred pronouns among themselves, there were few others who did that. The Women’s Cabinet, a group of organizational leaders hosted by the Women’s Center, was one of the only groups that actively incorporated PGPs into meetings.
Now, due at least in part to the arrival of a new director of BGLTQ student life who has personally dealt with issues of public pronoun usage, more and more Harvard students are acknowledging PGPs in daily conversations and meetings.
“This year, the QSA decided to reinstitute PGPs into our regular meetings as part of our overall mission to be more open to everyone,” said QSA co-chair Roland Yang ’14. “I personally think that it’s just as important as saying your House and your concentration.”
Alex said that at this year’s pre-orientation First-Year Urban Program, PGPs were a part of introductions and program leaders explained their importance.
Even some student organizations that do not explicitly focus on BGLTQ issues have started asking for PGPs during group introductions.
“I wanted to make Fuerza a really inclusive space,” said Fuerza Latina Vice President Joshua Hernandez ’14, who was instrumental in implementing PGPs at the group’s meetings. “It went well and people were very receptive. They found it cool.”
And the administration is adapting, too. Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said that the icebreaker on a recent retreat for the Office of Student Life included everyone saying their PGP.
“We’ll take the lead from the students,” Dingman said. “If this is something that matters to them, we will learn from them.”
Just two weeks ago, the Office of Student Life led a discussion on PGPs with BGLTQ Director of Student Life Van Bailey.
“Van is amazing, and it’s great that we have a director who is sensitive not just to LGB issues but also to trans issues,” said Ariel C. Churchill ’15, a co-chair of the Trans Task Force and an intern at the BGLTQ office.
Bailey declined to comment for this article.
Jake recently changed his name and gender with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. He said that the registrar’s office was receptive to changing this information in Harvard directories.
“They were open to me changing my gender and my name, no questions asked. I just had to give them a copy of my legal paperwork,” he said.
Harvard also allows students to fill in a preferred name and gender using the online registration tool, and gender-neutral housing became an option several years ago. Incoming freshmen can now indicate their gender identity in time for it to be taken into account for housing purposes.
Additionally, about 100 non-gendered bathrooms are available, spread out across campus. Amid all this progress for transgender students, pronouns, they say, remains an area where the discourse is lagging.
“People didn’t come knocking on my door asking me, ‘Hi, what are your PGPs now?’” Jake said. “I had to actively seek it out.”
TRANS 101
After the incident at the UC meeting, Bicknell emailed Benavides to ask what the Council could do to learn more about gender. Benavides said that she also received emails from several representatives who apologized for their behavior.
“What happened wasn’t out of malice,” Bicknell said. “I do believe it came out of just not knowing.”
Benavides said that it showed just how much work is left to be done.
Together with the Trans Task Force and the Women’s Center,  the BGLTQ Office of Student Life is planning to hold more “Gender 101” and “Trans 101” workshops so that students, faculty, and staff members can become better informed about PGPs and the trans community at Harvard.
“We’re really good at having the gay conversation, but the trans conversation is something we stumble over a little bit more,” Jamie said. “Whatever we can do to promote those conversations is really good.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the Harvard men’s basketball team’s season opener less than two weeks away, The Back Page is breaking down the Crimson’s non-conference opponents. Each week, we will take a look at two new foes. Over the weekend we profiled Vermont. Next up is Fordham.
When the Harvard men’s basketball team last met Fordham at Rose Hill Gym on Jan. 3, the Crimson was stunned by a team that managed to stifle Harvard offensively.The Rams’ 60-54 win marked the second loss for a Harvard squad that entered the game with a 12-1 record.
The Crimson will look to get redemption when the two teams  meet again on Dec. 1 at Lavietes Pavilion.
Last season’s victory over Harvard was a highlight for Fordham, which finished the year 10-19 overall and 3-13 in the Atlantic 10. The Rams were only able to nab one win on the road, which came against Siena College, 74-59. Fordham was led by the  6’7 Chris Gaston, who currently ranks 11th on Fordham’s all time-scoring list with 1,428 career points and places sixth in rebounding.
The forward had a double-double against Harvard, putting up 18 points and 10 rebounds. The game’s leading scorer was 6’2 rookie guard Bryan Smith who posted 22 points.
While the Rams shot a season-best 48.8 percent from the field and 50 percent from beyond the arc, they held the Crimson to 36.4 percent shooting from the field and 26.4 percent from. Then-senior forward Keith Wright was held to eight points.
Gaston and Smith will both return to threaten Harvard. Junior Branden Frazier is also a key contributor for the Rams. Last year the versatile guard led the squad in assists per game, with 4.1 and a team-high 118 through the season.
Fordham graduated just two starters from last year, Alberto Estwick and Kervin Bristol. The pair together netted an average of just 9.2 points per game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sitting on a park bench by the Coliseum, Harvard’s home football field, sophomore Mai Le smiles as she remembers her time playing football in high school. Le, a two-year starting kicker at St. Xavier’s Prep who now plays forward for the Crimson women’s soccer team, remembers how her coach, Darrell Lewis, begged her to play kicker starting in tenth grade.
“I was asked at the end of my sophomore year if I wanted to try out,” Le said. “I thought it was a joke, but he wrote in my yearbook that he still needed a kicker and was dropping a lot of hints about it at the end of the year. I talked it over with my parents and my dad was thrilled. He had three daughters and he never thought he’d have a football player.”
Although Le’s dad grew up in Vietnam, she said that going to Notre Dame cultivated his love for football early on and he supported her throughout her entire career. Her mom, who doubled as Le’s high school soccer coach, was a little worried about Le getting injured, but agreed to let her play.
Le kicked extra points, field goals, and kickoffs for St. Xavier, starting 10 games over her two-year stint on the team. Lewis said that beginning in her second year there were students from the boy’s soccer team looking to get her role, but that she was able to beat them out for the position because of her focus and discipline on the field.
“We had other soccer boys who wanted to be on the team, but Mai was the most mentally tough person we had,” Lewis said. “She was the best kicker on the team, guy or girl.”
ALONE IN THE PACK
Lewis said that although Le was the only female player on the team, there was not the tension one would expect. Although Le occasionally had to dress in a different locker room for road games or come dressed to the bus rides, he added that Le’s work ethic quickly earned her respect from her teammates.
“Mai was so athletic and humble and hardworking that there wasn’t as much awkwardness as there could have been,” Lewis said. “The male students had a lot of respect for her, and she was the type of leader that you want to be as a student-athlete, committed and doing a great job in the classroom and doing everything you want to do on the field.”
According to Le, while there were certainly awkward moments—at certain times she had to face the corner of the locker room while waiting for a player to alert her that the team was done changing—the team embraced her as one of their own.
“They were really accepting of me from the beginning,” Le recalls. “In the huddle, they would say ‘Nobody touches Mai, she’s like our sister.’ The freshmen would call me an older sister and ask me to sing them lullabies. When I started hearing other stories about the experiences that other girls had playing football, I realized what a special environment I was in. I was so lucky.”
Not wanting people to change how they played against her, Le wore her hair inside her helmet her junior year on the team so that opponents could not identify her by her sex. By her senior year, Le’s competitive side took over and she began to use her sex to her advantage in games, wearing her ponytail out and coming to warm up without a helmet to make sure other teams recognized it.
“My first year, I put on all my pads over my head and didn’t want people to register it,” Le said. “Senior year I began to realize guys who play football are much more conscientious about it and began to use it to my advantage.”
FROM SPORT TO SPORT
In the fall, Le would juggle both football and soccer by going to football practices earlier in the afternoon and club soccer practices late at night. Although both games feature eleven members on each side, according to Le the environment is very different between the two.
“In football, everything is prepared beforehand,” Le said. “Unlike soccer, which is much more free-flowing, everything is a set piece. It’s definitely an interesting contrast between the two. The culture of football is so unique in some ways because it’s almost like the military with the emphasis that it places on personal value. Everyone can step forward and be a leader in soccer, but in football everyone has a specific role and is disciplined enough to play within it.”
A sweeper for her high school soccer team, Le said that the kicks she took for the football team were similar to some of the long balls she would play in soccer. However, the California native said that playing football made adjusting to some aspects of soccer more difficult.
“After football season, I couldn’t shoot at all,” Le laughs. “I would go and just be kicking field goals over and over for an hour or two hours at a time during the season and when I got back to playing soccer, every shot would go way over the goal. Football definitely affected soccer much more than soccer affected football.”
SPECIAL MEMORIES
Lewis said his favorite memory of Le’s time at St. Xavier’s was her first PAT attempt in a game, where she was sandwiched on both sides by rushing defenders but kept her focus on the football, splitting the uprights with the kick.
“Just like Mai, she didn’t take her eyes off the ball and kicked it right through,” Lewis said. “She would never focus on the players around her—just on the ball and her kick.”
Although Le talks about hitting a 45-yard field goal in practice, she said her favorite memory of playing football was the only tackle that she made in a game.
“There was one player on the other team Coach told me not to kick it to,” Le remembers. “Of course, my kick ended up going right to him—literally, the ball dropped into his hands. He ran through the entire team and he was going down our sideline and I ran over and I managed to bring him down. I have never seen a boy get on his feet so fast.”
Ironically enough, Le said that she only began to practice tackling drills after she executed it in a game.
“The coach made sure that I was in tackling drills from then on,” Le said. “I laid out a freshman in the first drill but I’m hoping I never have to tackle again, that way I can keep my 100% streak going. Nobody has ever broken [a Mai Le tackle].”
MOVING FORWARD
Entrenched on the girl’s soccer team at Harvard now, Le has brought the same qualities that led her to success in high school, according to teammate and blockmate, sophomore goalkeeper Bethany Kanten.
“I think what really separates Mai as a good teammate is that her work ethic is crazy,” Kanten said. “She works harder than any other person…and you know she will bring one hundred percent every day. She’s never going to let herself go through the motions; she’s always trying to get better.”
Back at Xavier Prep, Lewis added that Le started a tradition, and that although nobody has had her success at the varsity level, the team has employed female kicker for portions of every year since she left.
“Girls have tried to follow suit,” Lewis said. “One started when she first got there but her father stood in the way of her continuing with football. She was a soccer player and unlike Mai’s family, he didn’t want her doing anything other than soccer. We’ve had people asking about it, and this past year we had an incoming player that was planning to play before tearing her ACL. We hope that she’ll be back this year.”
Le, who wrote about playing football on her college application, said that she learned a lot from playing football that went beyond the Friday night lights. A four-year captain and Most Valuable Player of her high school soccer team, Le explained that football taught her a lot about being on a team.
“It was such a defining moment for me playing [on the football team],” Le said. “I learned how to be totally team-oriented and not about myself. In high school, every player who has some measure of success in these sports begins to be placed on a pedestal, and it was actually much better preparation for coming to college sports than my team dynamic in soccer.”
Le smiles when asked if she considered playing football in college, responding that although she learned a lot from playing football at St. Xavier’s, she never seriously contemplated trying out for the Crimson and is reluctant to mention it even to her current teammates.
“I don’t mention that I played football in high school to [my teammates],” Le said. “It’s a very team oriented kind of mentality in soccer, and, that being the case, I don’t want to promote individuals above the team.”
Fresh off of practice, Le is fittingly dressed from head to toe in her Harvard soccer outfit, her current focus. Looking towards the football field, she adds one final comment.
“It’s a fun fact to drop, but that’s not why I’m on this side of the river.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“We can’t hear you! WE CAN’T HEAR YOU!”
Jersey clad and scarf-wearing Bentley fans drowned out a small group of Crimson faithful as they attempted to put together a dismissive “Na na na na, na na na na, hey, hey, hey, goodbye” chant in the closing minutes of last Saturday’s dominant 5-0 Harvard men’s ice hockey victory at Bright Hockey Arena.
The No. 17 Crimson opened the season with high expectations following an impressive post-season run to close out the 2011-12 campaign, yet student interest in what has long been perceived as one of Harvard’s premier sports is waning.
Of the 2,911 people in attendance on Saturday night, I can roughly estimate that Harvard undergraduates were outnumbered 4:1 by their road-tripping Bentley compatriots. There is no obligation on behalf of students to get out and support their school’s athletics, and Saturday night was the biggest night of Halloweekend with parties to attend and Rubinoff to consume. But the game against Bentley was representative of a larger trend across the board for Harvard sports teams—with the lone exception of Crimson men’s basketball:  a lack of a real home-field advantage in the way of fan support.
Harvard’s men’s ice hockey program is over 100 years old. The Crimson won a national championship in 1989, are currently ranked in the Top 25 and have produced no fewer than 24 All-Americans, 24 National Hockey League players, and 30 Olympians. On this season’s roster alone there are nine players who have already been drafted by NHL teams. Yet, at the opening game of the season a school with 2,000 fewer undergraduates than Harvard was able to bus in many times the number of fans to support its team. If this team can’t get fans out to its games, what hope does a team like, for example, field hockey have?
And it’s not for want of the Harvard athletic department’s trying. In addition to free tickets for undergraduates, the first 100 students carrying a valid HUID were given free dinner and dessert. Efforts to get fans of any kind into Bright extended to any proven resident of Allston, Brighton, or Cambridge gaining free admission as well. Perhaps these promotions could be better publicized, but I doubt that would accomplish much in the way of getting people through the door and supporting Harvard hockey.
A common argument is ‘why should we care?’ Who cares if Harvard students are supporting their sports teams or not? After all, couldn’t they be spending their time on more important things? Leaving aside the discussion of inter-collegiate athletics having a strong and deep connection with the idealized version of an American undergraduate education, what benefit does spending two hours on a Saturday night cheering for your classmates have for you and your community?
For one, as the basketball team has shown, it creates and fosters a sense of unity in an otherwise divisive social climate. Despite, or perhaps because of, the exclusivity of gaining admission to Harvard, there is little to no common identity formed between fellow students. Indeed, in a survey of the graduating class of 2012, only one of the 12 undergraduate houses—Currier—had every student indicate that they felt a strong sense of community and unity within their house.
Part of what makes Harvard great is that it offers such a diverse range of things in which students can invest their time and truly find what they are passionate about. But this sometimes comes at the expense of otherwise common experiences and memories that can be shared by the entire undergraduate population.
One of these common experiences is the Harvard-Yale football game. Regardless of where you come from or where you invest your time, you can collectively rejoice in engaging in the age-old tradition of drinking early in the morning and passing out sometime around the middle of the third quarter—though the last part may have more to do with Harvard’s dominance over Yale in recent years.
But even then there are barriers of entry for much of the Harvard-Yale experience. Not everyone is welcome at every tailgate, nor at every party.
Students continuously lament the lack of common centralized social spaces that are open to everyone in the student body. While these complaints are legitimate, there is an un-tapped social space sitting right across the Charles River.
The student section of a sporting event is one of the least socially stratified places on a college campus. Whether you understand what is happening on the ice or not, the only barrier of entry that exists in a student section is the same one that we all passed not too long ago: being a Harvard student. On a campus that often struggles to make sense of its social life, I encourage everyone to make the trek down to the Bright Hockey Center, and let them hear you. Worst case scenario you get to see some darn good hockey.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a breakout season that few saw coming, Jeremy Lin ’10 will begin a new chapter in his career with the Houston Rockets when they travel to take on the Detroit Pistons Wednesday night. Although Lin is moving out of the limelight that accompanies athletes in New York, Linsanity’s touchdown in Houston will certainly bring the Rockets an increased national media following.
The Rockets recently acquired former Oklahoma City Thunder star James Harden—a move that will take some pressure off Lin—who at times appeared to struggle in preseason. Although he played nearly half of every game, Lin averaged only 6.3 points per game and shot a meager 28.3 percent from the field during the warm-up contests. Lin will need to improve on his Achilles heel of 6.4 turnovers every 48 minutes last year if he is to effectively lead the Houston offense.
Quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 and the Buffalo Bills were off this week. With nearly half the season in the books, the Amish Rifle finds himself ranked 28th out of all active quarterbacks with 205 yards per game. But Fitzpatrick also has posted an average passer rating of 86.1 that falls in the top half of the NFL, and he ranks sixth in the league with 15 touchdowns thrown. The Bills will be back in action next week when they play the Texans on the road.
Hockey player Louis Leblanc, formerly ’13, has suffered an injury that will likely keep him sidelined for 4-6 weeks. Currently playing for the Hamilton Bulldogs in the AHL, Leblanc incurred a high ankle sprain during a fight in a game on October 20. Leblanc received a fighting major penalty, but the injury will serve to keep him off the ice for a good deal longer.
Leblanc—along with every other professional hockey player, regardless of any injury—is unlikely to see NHL action soon. As the lockout stretches on and the Players’ Association and the NHL have not met for two weeks, rumors are circulating that the league will soon have to cancel all games through the Winter Classic.

Breaking news: Yalies can get jobs. Surprising as it may be, Yale alumni are the second most employable group of college graduates, according to a New York Times survey.
While Harvard topped the charts (and we'll get to that later), let's first look at other top schools and where they stand in the rankings.
Coming in at number three is Harvard's mother school, the University of Cambridge.
The home of the Rhodes Scholarship is fourth in the survey. Oxford, the filming location of the Harry Potter movies, unfortunately couldn't wizard its way into the top three.
Fifth is Silicon Valley's technical school, Stanford. Apparently the Cardinals can out-program number six: MIT. You may know MIT as that school two stops down the Red Line.
The Ivy League makes its next appearance in the rankings as Columbia earns number seven. With the highest tuition in the Ivy League, Columbia can promise its grads a somewhat employable future.
According to their number eight slot, after Princeton students are through with bickering about eating clubs, they're landing the jobs schools one through seven didn't want.
Brown University comes in at number 22 and University of Pennsylvania, the school known for its pre-professional curriculum, secured number 39. Even Wharton couldn't make up for the rest of Penn's employability factors.
And our two remaining Ivy League friends are over in the middle of nowhere. Darthmouth and Cornell received numbers 41 and 87, respectively.
In the end, Harvard tops the list. To those freshmen already frequenting Goldman information sessions, you can rest assured that your future career is safe. You, yes, you are desirable.

We did not list Brown University in the first version of this post. Brown University was ranked number 22.

In this mini-series, Flyby profiles one of the seven fall 2012 IOP Fellows each week. This week: James E. Doyle.
After four decades away, Harvard Law School graduate and former Governor of Wisconsin James E. Doyle has returned to Cambridge as an IOP fellow, noting that many aspects of the Harvard Square atmosphere have changed.
"I was here in the 70's, and let's just say the world was different. You could get high just walking from one end of Harvard Square to the other," Doyle joked.
However, many parts of Doyle's life, such as his passion for politics, have stayed the same. Both Doyle's parents were active members of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, allowing Doyle to grow up meeting politicians such as Adlai Stevenson and John F. Kennedy '40.
After graduating from the University of Wisconsin in 1967, Doyle served in the Peace Corps and then came to Cambridge to study at HLS.
With such a politically charged background, Doyle returned to Madison, Wisconsin, where he worked in law. After serving as an attorney for 30 years, he felt compelled to run for governor in 2002 and defeated the Republican incumbent.
"It was really a question of leadership. The incumbent was a nice person, and I had known him for years, but there were a number of issues," Doyle said.
Doyle served two terms as governor. He acknowledged that politics are a tough game and that it takes a certain kind of person to be a politician.
"I probably shouldn't say this at the Kennedy School, but politics isn't about policy. It's about people," Doyle said.
However, Doyle admitted that politics isn't always pleasant. In his study group at the IOP, Politics as a Noble Pursuit, Doyle discusses both the good and the bad in politics.
"[Politics] is a tough—at times nasty, at times exhilarating—business, and I really want students to think hard about whether this is something they might want to do," Doyle said.
Meeting every Tuesday from 4 to 5:30 p.m. at the IOP, the study group has featured notable guests including New Mexico Senator Thomas S. Udall and Governor Deval L. Patrick '78.
After Doyle finished his second term as governor, he decided to apply to be a IOP fellow because of his admiration of the Kennedy School’s namesake.
"I went in the Peace Corps completely and entirely because I was inspired by [John F.] Kennedy. Being able to come back and be at the place that's the living memorial to his commitment to service is really incredible for me," Doyle said.
While Doyle's days of electoral politics have ended, he said he is positive about the future of American politics and the country.
"If anyone has worries about the future of America, they can just come to a place like this. It doesn't have to be Harvard—any college across the country. You walk away from there realizing that we're going to be okay," Doyle said.

We've all heard about the supposed health risks of drinking soda—there's too much sugar, it's bad for you, it'll rot your teeth, it'll rot your mind, etc. With so many studies and reports being published, it's hard to tell what to believe. Recently, a Harvard teaching facility has admitted to promoting inconclusive data while another Harvard study links soda consumption to increased aggression.
Earlier this week the Brigham and Women's Hospital, a Harvard teaching facility, released a report about an artificial sweetener called aspartame, which is present in most diet sodas. The report links aspartame to increased risks of leukemia, lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but just before the report was released, the researchers were asked some tough questions, questions that lead to an awkward admission of weak data and an apology.
In other soda related news, a Harvard study of Boston public high school students has shown that students who identified as heavy soda drinkers were more likely to engage in violent behavior.  The researchers controlled for other factors, such as alcohol, weight, and tobacco use, and found some surprising answers. The heavy drinkers were more likely to act violently towards peers, towards another child in their family, and towards their partner in a dating relationship. They were also more likely to have carried a gun or knife.
Neither study decisively proves the harmful effects of soda, so until more intensive studies are preformed, it looks like you're safe to enjoy a glass of your favorite soda without worrying too much about the possibility of either cancer risks or increased violence.

With Election Day just a week away, the Springfield Republican just became the last of Massachusetts's major dailies to weigh in on the state's U.S. Senate race. The paper, which serves much of central and western Massachusetts, joined the Boston Globe and The Harvard Crimson in endorsing Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren."We need a voice for working families in Washington again," the editorial concluded. "Elizabeth Warren will give us that voice." Disagreeing with both the Globe and the Republican, the Boston Herald endorsed Senator Scott Brown two weeks ago. Polls released in the last two days have shown the candidates running neck-in-neck as voters prepare to fill out their ballots next Tuesday.
Brown and Warren were scheduled to debate one final time tonight, but both candidates withdrew in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. It is yet unclear if the debate will be rescheduled. Warren has said she is willing to participate in a make-up debate Thursday night, while Brown said he is not interested in another debate.

Yes, you did just hear the Lowell Bells ring. Yes, it was midnight. Yes, it was for Halloween. No, that's not really a reason. Yes, Lowell did it anyway.
From all of us at Flyby, have a very Happy (bell-free, please, Lowell?) Halloween!
