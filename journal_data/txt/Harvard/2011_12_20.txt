After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two swastikas were found on the side of a Harvard-owned building located at 69 Dunster Street on Sunday, prompting religious leaders to condemn the act of vandalism and the hateful message commonly associated with the image. The swastikas were spray-painted side-by-side in bright red on the wall of the building, which is located behind the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter and the University Lutheran Church.
Jayms Battaglia, parish administrator at the church, said that she was “deeply saddened” by the swastikas. Battaglia had noticed the swastikas Sunday morning, and said that she spoke with someone from 69 Dunster Street who told her the occupants were “aware” of the graffiti. She added she had also brought the incident to the attention of the University.
According to Deputy Superintendent Jack Albert, no one has filed a report on the swastika with the Cambridge Police Department. Harvard University Police Department did not return requests for comment.
The building’s administrators and Harvard Yard Operations could not be reached for comment Monday evening.
Rabbi Jonah C. Steinberg, executive director of Harvard Hillel, condemned the act of vandalism, calling it inconsistent with “the spirit of respect that generally prevails at Harvard.”
Steinberg, who said that he did not know of the incident until The Crimson reached out to him for comment, said that he was not sure what could have compelled a person to graffiti a building with a symbol so often associated with racial bigotry.
“One can only feel pity for someone who is compelled to express hatred in such a way,” Steinberg said.
He added that he plans to bring the incident to the attention of the College chaplains, who he expects will collectively issue a response to the incident.
Like Steinberg, Emily S. Unger ’13, incoming chair of the Harvard College Progressive Jewish Alliance, said that she was not aware of the incident until informed by The Crimson.
“This is the first instance of anti-Semitism that I think I’ve seen while at Harvard,” Unger said. “I just hope that the Harvard community will come together in response to this and make it clear to the world that this is not acceptable in our eyes. It is not something that we will tolerate.”
Unger said that she thought the College should release a statement condemning the act of vandalism and the implicit meaning behind such a symbol.
“There’s nothing more strongly anti-Semitic than a swastika,” Unger said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two people were struck by a car on Tuesday at Widener Gate along Mass. Ave.
The victims, a security guard employed by Harvard and an individual not affiliated with the University, were both hospitalized, according to Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Daniel M. Riviello and Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano.
Security guards have been posted at Widener Gate and other gates to Harvard Yard since mid-November, when the University barred visitors without Harvard IDs from entering the Yard due to security concerns surrounding the Occupy Harvard encampment.
The protesters announced last week that they plan to remove their tents from the Yard and they hope the ID checks at the gates will soon end.
Both CPD and HUPD are investigating the collision.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Growing up in Montreal together, Alex Killorn and Louis Leblanc shared a dream.
Both played hockey in a city enamored with the sport, grew up rooting for the hometown Canadiens, and had the ultimate goal of one day donning NHL jerseys of their own.
The pair knew each other through hockey circles for much of their childhoods. Both played for the Lac St-Louis Lions of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League before Leblanc took his game to Omaha, Neb. to play in the USHL, where he was an All-Star.
After winning the World Under-17 Hockey Challenge as a member of Team Quebec in 2006—Leblanc would do the same two years later—Killorn was selected by the Tampa Bay Lightning in the third round (77th overall) of the 2007 NHL Draft.
He decided to attend Harvard before joining the Lightning organization, and finished third on the team in scoring as a freshman during the 2008-09 season.
In June 2009, Leblanc was taken in the first round (18th overall) of the NHL Draft—which was held in Montreal—by the hometown Canadiens. That meant that one day, the center would have the chance to play for the team that he and Killorn had grown up cheering for.
But until then, Leblanc decided to join his fellow Quebecer at Harvard, also believing college hockey would provide him with valuable experience before turning pro.
It was in Cambridge that the friendship between the two Canadian hockey stars would grow stronger.
“I’ve known Louis probably my whole life,” Killorn says. “[But] once we got to Harvard, played on the line together, and got to know each other better, we became even better friends.”
During the 2009-10 season, both displayed the skills that had made them NHL draft picks. Leblanc led the team in points (23), goals (11), and finished second in assists (12) while winning Ivy Rookie of the Year; Killorn finished just three points, two goals, and one assist behind.
At the end of the season, Leblanc was ready to begin his professional career, leaving Killorn and his other teammates and forfeiting his remaining three years of NCAA eligibility to sign a three-year contract with the Canadiens.
The center joined the Montreal Junior Hockey Club for the 2010-11 season, and, upon turning 20 at the year’s conclusion, turned pro, joining the American Hockey League.
With Leblanc gone, Killorn emerged as Harvard’s star, leading the Crimson with 15 goals and finishing second on the team with 29 points as a junior. While he did so, he kept an eye of the progress of his friend, who registered three points and the game-winning overtime goal in his first professional contest with the Hamilton Bulldogs, a 3-2 win over the Rochester Americans and another former teammate, Alex Biega ’10, on Oct. 27.
This year, Killorn, now an assistant captain, has continued to shine at the Bright Hockey Center, leading the squad with six goals through 10 contests.
Meanwhile, Leblanc has taken his game to a whole new level, achieving the pair’s childhood aspiration of reaching the NHL.
On Nov. 28, the Canadiens called up the center from Hamilton, and he played in his first game two days later against the Anaheim Ducks.
Then, on Thursday night, Leblanc scored his first NHL goal in front of the 20,000-plus hometown fans at the Bell Centre, picking up a deflection and beating Philadelphia Flyers’ goalie Sergei Bobrovsky from 10-feet out.
“It was unbelievable,” Leblanc says. “Getting a big cheer from the crowd, it was a very special moment for me.”
Leblanc’s parents could not be there to see the moment in person, as his father had to work in Boston.
But he did have one special fan in attendance—his former linesman, Killorn.
“He called me two days before the game and said he was coming,” Leblanc said. “I was excited to see him, and I was happy he was able to be there. ... I’ll remember that forever.”
The rookie received a standing ovation from the hometown fans, including his former teammate, who got to see his friend score a goal for the team they had both grown up rooting for.
“Since he got drafted, he’s gotten a lot of attention,” Killorn says. “I know, being a Montreal native, a lot of people support him, and to actually see him play in the NHL for the Montreal Canadiens is huge. I guess you could call him a hometown hero.”
Killorn says it was a moment that made a lot of their fellow Quebecers proud.
“After the goal was announced, they couldn’t even drop the puck because the crowd was so loud,” the forward recalls.
For Leblanc, scoring an NHL goal was a dream come true. But he also knows he has a lot to work on; the center has only averaged 9:25 in ice time in his nine games with Montreal.
Coach Jacques Martin had hinted he wanted to send the rookie back down to Hamilton to gain more experience when some injured veterans returned to Montreal, but Martin was fired Saturday, leaving Leblanc’s fate unknown.
For now, then, the rookie is just enjoying his time in the NHL and taking in everything he can.
“It’s been great,” Leblanc says. “I’m just learning a lot from the more experienced guys. ... The game is so much faster and so much quicker than the other leagues I’ve played in, [so] just being responsible and doing things right is very important.”
For Killorn, witnessing his friend achieve his dream has strengthened his own desire to one day suit up for the Lightning.
“It’s definitely exciting for me,” Killorn says. “It just lets you know how close, how realistic [playing in the NHL] can be. Talking to him about how the process has gone for him ... shows if you just keep working hard, it’s a legitimate possibility.”
