After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like most Clevelanders, I’ve spent the last two days in disbelief. I have spent my entire life seriously thinking that I would probably be in my 50s or 60s before I could see the day a Cleveland sports team broke the curse. And it happened in such a beautiful fashion: Our disgraced hometown hero returned to redeem himself and his city with superhuman strength, speed, cleverness, and charisma after falling behind by a supposedly insurmountable margin. It is the stuff of fantasy, especially in Cleveland.
As one of ABC’s announcers said shortly after the buzzer, unless you've lived in Cleveland, it's hard to understand the magnitude of this moment. This city has been through the worst of institutional failure, outsourcing, poverty, and misery—earning, by some metrics, the title of the most economically distressed city in America.
And we’ve gone 52 years without a championship parade. To a non-Clevelander, it might sound shallow to mention that statistic alongside such serious problems, but the disappointments were heartbreakingly symbolic. The curse (or, for the unsuperstitious, the stunningly unfortunate drought) became deeply ingrained in our civic identity. The 52 years were full of seemingly divinely-ordained near misses, building in every fan a distrust of good news, and managerial ineptitude that gave rise to the nickname “The Mistake on the Lake” for the old Municipal Stadium—and eventually to the entire town.
But resilience was born from the misery. The city adopted the unofficial motto, “There’s always next year,” and, recently, the catchphrase “Believeland.” Believeland is, at once, a nickname, an imperative verb, and a prayer: That someday, despite every crushing disappointment, we’d get that championship, a hope more Messianic than practical. But the spirit of Believeland isn’t just about the Cavaliers, Indians, and Browns, and it won’t fade now. It’s a heartfelt optimism that, no matter how bleak the present of our Rust Belt depression may be, things will start looking up again on the shores of Lake Erie. We will overcome the horrors of police violence, we will improve our struggling schools, we will find something to fill the cavernous void left by the probably permanent disappearance of manufacturing jobs.
There are no easy solutions, and it will, of course, take more than a few individuals with remarkable gifts and an overwhelming will to win. But, right now, Believeland believes. The Cavs came back from three games to one, the first team in Finals history to do so. Maybe, as that ABC announcer said, it had to be something like that, where the world had completely counted us out, for us to overcome the odds break the curse.
In some ways, Cleveland finds itself in totally unfamiliar territory; we’re still finding the vocabulary for celebration. But this championship is really just more evidence of what we already know: that no comeback is impossible, that the underdog can win with resilience and grit, and that we should never abandon hope, even in our darkest hours.
Thank you, LeBron James. Thank you, Cavaliers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the search for a permanent Harvard Medical School dean continues, Barbara J. McNeil, a current professor at the school, will assume the role of acting dean on Aug. 1, the University announced Tuesday.
McNeil has spent more than 30 years on the Medical School faculty in various research and advisory roles. She also served a previous stint as acting dean in the summer of 2007, just before Medical School Dean Jeffrey S. Flier—who is set to resign at the end of July after nine years at the helm of the school—took office. 
In a press release, University President Drew G. Faust and Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, who have led the search for a new dean, lauded McNeil as “one of Harvard Medical School’s most able and experienced leaders, scholars, educators, and institutional citizens.”
The search for a new dean has been ongoing since November 2015, when Flier announced that he would step down from the position.
“I have known, admired, and worked with Barbara for many years, and she is a leader with a proven track record and a deep knowledge and appreciation of the HMS ecosystem,” Flier said in a press release. “The school will be in excellent hands.”
McNeil will inherit many of the projects undertaken during Flier’s tenure as dean, most notably the school’s ongoing $750 million capital campaign, 70 percent of which has been raised as of late April.  Flier also oversaw a curriculum overhaul in 2015, which integrated multiple disciplines into single classes and included measures to make students engage actively in the classroom.
At the Medical School, McNeil pioneered the creation of the school’s health care policy department, which she has chaired since its inception in 1988. A Harvard Medical School graduate, McNeil has served on several advisory committees focused on curriculum development at the school, including the medical education reform executive committee, the board of advisors to the joint M.D.-Ph.D. program, and the steering committee for the joint M.D.-M.B.A. program
According to the press release, the search for a permanent dean for the faculty of Medicine is “progressing well.” In January, Faust and Garber welcomed nominations and confidential input from Harvard affiliates about the process in an email to University affiliates.
“We would especially encourage observations about the principal opportunities and challenges facing Harvard Medical School, on the professional and personal attributes you regard as most important to seek in the next dean, and on particular individuals you believe would warrant serious consideration for the deanship,” they wrote at the start of the search.
Since then, more than 300 Medical School students signed a petition sponsored by a campus organization committed to racial justice imploring Faust to select a dean committed to increasing the school’s diversity and with a track record of promoting social justice through his or her scholarship on equity in health care.
“To truly dismantle systemic inequalities across our nation and world, we must also dismantle them at home,” the petition stated. “We need a leader committed to social justice both inside and outside our community.”
In a year in which the University’s various graduate and professional schools grappled with issues of racial diversity, the School of Public Health made history in February with its appointment of Michelle A. Williams, the first black individual to head a faculty at the University. Williams, who is set to take the reins from interim Dean David J. Hunter in July, will also be the School of Public Health’s first female dean.
