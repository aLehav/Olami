After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 285 graduate students and research assistants — at least 18 of them at Harvard — signed a letter Thursday calling for changes within the field of economics in response to allegations of sexual harassment against Economics Professor Roland G. Fryer, Jr.
The signatories asked economics departments at universities across the country and the American Economic Association to implement a set of three changes — to better listen to graduate students, create codes of conduct, and implement a reporting system to “document bad behavior.” At least two former research assistants at the Education Innovation Lab — the think tank Fryer founded — signed the letter.
The Crimson first reported the existence of at least one Title IX investigation into Fryer in May, and another in December. Fryer is the subject of two additional Harvard-led investigations — one into allegations of sexual harassment and one into his lab’s finances — according to the New York Times.
He also faces a state-level investigation led by the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination based on a complaint filed separately by one of the Harvard complainants.
Multiple complainants allege Fryer engaged in unwelcome sexual conduct towards female employees and created a hostile environment for women at EdLabs. In a May interview with The Crimson and a December op-ed published in the Times, Fryer denied the sexual harassment allegations against him.
Harvard’s Office for Dispute Resolution — which conducts investigations into formal complaints of sexual- and gender-based harassment — issued a report this fall on one investigation, but at least one other ODR inquiry remains ongoing.
Several months after The Crimson’s report, AEA members elected Fryer to the association’s 2019 Executive Committee — a position held in the past by several Nobel Prize winners. In October, the current committee said in a statement they believed many members voted while unaware of the allegations against Fryer. Following growing calls for his resignation on social media, Fryer resigned from the committee on Dec. 18.
University of Michigan Ph.D. student Evelyn A. Smith said she drafted the letter published Thursday earlier this month after reading about the allegations against Fryer. She then worked on it with a group of economics students advocating for diversity within the field, who distributed it more widely.
Smith said she thought graduate students signed the letter because they are in a “vulnerable” position within academia.
“When news of the results of the investigations came out, it left a lot of graduate students and research assistants feeling sort of helpless and angry,” she said. “We saw an opportunity to express pretty clearly the things that need to change.”
In the letter, students wrote that widespread problems in economics have pushed their colleagues to leave the field.
“We are tired of seeing friends and colleagues who could have been brilliant economists forced out by the terrible climate in our discipline. We are tired of leaders in the field refusing to see problems happening right under their noses,” the letter reads. “We are tired of having these problems distract from what we came here to do: meaningful, high-quality economic research.”
Of the students who signed the letter, 75 had chosen to remain anonymous as of Thursday evening — some of them Harvard affiliates. Smith said she thinks this is evidence of graduate students’ precarious position within their departments.
“The recommendations of this letter are not controversial. We’re asking for basic workplace protections. So the fact that 72 or 73 people felt like they couldn’t publicly say that they support these workplace protections should send a signal to our field that things are really bad,” she said.
Harvard Ph.D. student Megan R. Bailey wrote in an email that she signed the letter because she thought it offered straightforward solutions for the field of economics.
“The suggestions in the letter ask for common-sense incentives—precisely the policy solutions economists are trained to create to improve welfare. In a time when misconduct is being revealed in many professions, this is exactly what we need: policy solutions,” Bailey wrote.
Economics department chair Jeremy C. Stein wrote in an email that department administrators will meet with a group of graduate students in January to discuss the recommendations and “related matters.”
Ph.D. students Kathryn A. Holston and Anna M. Stansbury, who lead Graduate Women in Economics, wrote in an email they have had “very productive meetings with department leadership” and support the suggestions in the letter.
“We see codes of conduct as a useful step to define acceptable standards and inappropriate behavior and to encourage a culture of accountability,” Holston and Stansbury wrote. “We would stress that a code of conduct needs to be informally as well as formally enforced by individuals speaking to their colleagues and peers when they see behavior which crosses a line.”
Stein wrote that the department has previously taken one of the steps outlined in the letter — when a faculty member comes up for promotion, Stein solicits and reports confidential feedback from graduate students on their “advising, mentoring or in-class experiences they have had with [a] faculty member.”
Fryer and the AEA did not respond to request for comment on the letter or the recommended changes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The admissions lawsuit that could shape the future of affirmative action at schools across the country escalated in 2018 as Harvard and plaintiff Students for Fair Admissions sparred over allegations of anti-Asian-American bias in the College’s admissions process during a high-profile three-week trial this fall.
The trial marked the culmination of a year filled with increasing debate about affirmative action at the College and scrutiny of Harvard’s famously selective, and secretive, admissions process.
In April, federal Judge Allison D. Burroughs ruled to release thousands of pages of admissions documents to the public, though lawyers representing Harvard had previously argued that some of this admissions data should remain under seal.
The admissions data, detailed in filings made by each side in June, showed that Harvard hopefuls receive numerical ratings ranging from 1 to 6 on factors including academic promise, athletic ability, and extracurricular involvement. Applicants also receive a “personal” score, which rates them on qualities including “humor” and “grit.”
The court documents also revealed that a 2013 internal Harvard study concluded that Asian American applicants received lower personal ratings than applicants of other races. The filings also confirmed the existence of the “Z-list” and showed that legacies  — the children of Harvard or Radcliffe College alumni  — and recruited athletes often receive a boost in the admissions process.
At the end of July, every Ivy League university, 25 campus affinity groups, the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, and the American Civil Liberties Union submitted amicus briefs to the court that supported Harvard’s position. The Asian American Coalition for Education filed a brief siding with SFFA on behalf of 156 Asian-American organizations.
The Department of Justice also weighed in, filing a “statement of interest” in August that argued Harvard perpetuates “unlawful racial discrimination” against Asian American applicants.
Prior to the trial, both sides rallied their supporters in dueling demonstrations near Harvard.
The trial kicked off Oct. 15 at the federal courthouse in Boston with opening statements from each side’s lawyers. College administrators including Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, and former University President Drew G. Faust defended the College’s scoring system for applicants, socioeconomic makeup, and special treatment for applicants with ties to donors.
Statistical experts hired by each side also clashed over whether admissions data indicated that the College discriminates against Asian-American applicants.
In late December, Harvard and SFFA summarized their proposed “findings of fact” and “conclusions of law” in legal filings. Rebuttals are due by Jan. 23, with additional amicus briefs from outside parties due Jan. 9. Burroughs will hear an additional set of arguments from both sides on Feb. 13, and is expected to render a decision in mid-2019.
Legal experts anticipate the losing side will appeal the verdict and predict that the case will eventually reach the Supreme Court. The outcome of the trial will likely shape the future of affirmative action at private colleges and universities nationwide.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A study on leaves of absence at Ivy League colleges released this month gave Harvard’s procedures a failing grade, critiquing policies that mandate a minimum length for leaves and set a strict deadline for applications to return.
Harvard received a D-minus, tying it with Cornell for the third lowest grade overall. Researchers working at the Ruderman Family Foundation — a disability rights advocacy group founded in Boston — chose to study Ivy League schools because “they represent the most elite institutions of higher education,” according to the study. A press release sent alongside the Foundation’s findings concluded all eight Ivies “fail students with mental illness.”
Miriam Heyman, a developmental psychologist and disability inclusion programs director for the foundation, authored the paper and scored each member of the Ivy League’s leave of absence policies on 15 indicators of “institutional support for students with mental health disabilities.”
The universities received scores ranging from one to three for each of the indicators, with one being the lowest. The ratings measured aspects of leave of absence policies like transparency and language about accomodations. Harvard scored 28 out of 45 possible points based on policies in the College and Harvard School of Public Health handbooks, earning it a failing grade.
None of the eight schools Heyman surveyed scored higher than a D-plus.
To take a voluntary leave from the College, students have until the first day of reading period to petition the Administrative Board with their reasons for requesting leave, according to the student handbook. The policy adds that, “under certain circumstances,” administrators may also decide to place a student on leave without their consent — a rule the study sharply criticized.
Roughly one in 20 undergraduates takes voluntary or involuntary leaves each year, according to data provided by the Ad Board. In the 2014-2015 school year, the Ad Board approved 242 petitions for a leave of absence and placed 54 students on involuntary leave.
Harvard earned a score of one on several aspects of its leave of absence policies, indicating those policies are “problematic.” The policies criticized in the report include Harvard’s restriction on taking leaves of absence after the start of reading period each semester and the school's requirement that returning students must register with their Resident Dean at least 12 weeks before the start of their next term.
For other policies, like allowing students on leave to visit campus and maintaining transparency in procedures for petitioning for a leave of absence, the study indicated that Harvard already maintains the “best practice.”
Heyman and her colleagues wrote that Harvard and peer schools should revise leave of absence policies the researchers consider discriminatory against students with mental illness.
“The grades noted above convey that the Ivy League schools still have a lot of work to do in order to meet these ideals,” researchers wrote. “Only then will they live up to their reputation of leadership.”
Harvard spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman declined to respond immediately to a request for comment on the Foundation’s findings Thursday.
