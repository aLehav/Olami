After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every so often I receive an email from the Office of Career Services inquiring as to whether I’d be interested in joining the Marine Corps. At first glance, their outreach makes sense; after all, I’m a military age male with unusually short hair. Moreover, I’ve discussed military strategy with virtually everyone I’ve met, so it’s no surprise that my advisors know I’m interested in pursuing a military career. There’s just one problem: I’m already contracted with the Army.
For the Marines reading this: I’m not admitting the Army’s alleged inferiority (that debate was settled during Sunday’s football match—Go Army, beat Navy!). Instead, I’d like to discuss Harvard’s strange relationship with cadets in terms of career advice. For starters, I dislike wasting time; the government already commandeers a large chunk of my life, so the last thing I need is another bureaucratic force attempting to influence my decisions. Enter Harvard’s advising system.
College advisors at OCS and beyond are generally kind, sympathetic people. Their warm smiles, perky demeanor, and insistence on buying you coffee can sometimes prove a bit too heartening—even creepy, in my opinion—but they’re certainly not the worst individuals to converse with on campus. However, in my experience, the advice they provide for the most part proves irrelevant.
First, most College advisors that I’ve interacted with seem to have no idea how the military functions. Don’t get me wrong; I’m no military expert. I don’t descend from a long line of servicemen, nor do I come from a community steeped in military tradition. As my friends from summer training can attest, my soldier senses remain under construction, and to this day I struggle with land navigation.
However, Harvard’s taught me one thing well: the art of detecting (and producing) eloquent nonsense. Unfortunately, I think our advising community often offers our students nothing more than beautifully worded, unhelpful advice. When presenting potential plans to advisors, I’m regularly faced with passive nods, followed by a short speech of sorts outlining how I should pursue my professional dreams.
However, questions pertaining to military service are separate from the typical philosophical college struggles regarding individual purpose and the meaning of life. The decisions I make over these next few semesters will determine the location and manner in which I serve, thereby impacting my loved ones and the relationships I share with them. As such, vague answers are the last thing I need when shaping the next four to eight years of my life.
When I seek advice from professional counselors, I want strong answers. I dislike the look-within-yourself approach that most advisors seem to have adopted these days. If I knew the answer all along, why would I ask for your help in the first place? I’m not some padawan on his way to becoming a Jedi (if only); I’m a cadet who wants some strong, opinionated, and harsh advice on whether to accrue additional years of military service in exchange for graduate school. I want unfiltered answers, not a pat on the back or another consolatory sandwich from some OCS event.
I know Harvard counselors have wise opinions; after all, they’re smart, capable individuals with decades of experience between them. And yet, for reasons unknown, I feel as though they consistently spew cheesy one-liners and motivational quotes. Perhaps they fear the accountability that comes with providing someone with tough advice. Perhaps they fear telling Harvard students that their plans are ill-fated. Perhaps they’re afraid of admitting that arbitrary events, rather than skill, play the largest role in determining our fate.
Another counseling session ends. I’m handed yet another pamphlet regarding Officer Candidate School (OCS—life’s coincidences sure tend to humor me), a program that, as an ROTC cadet, proves nothing but redundant and irrelevant. I fake a smile and kindly accept the pamphlet, pretending to have learned something new over the past hour. All in all, I’m no closer to understanding what I want to do in the Army, or for how long.
But who knows? Maybe I’m too harsh. Perhaps Harvard will one day discover that Army cadets aren’t interested in also joining the Marine Corps.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The election of Donald J. Trump has deeply disturbed many in the Harvard community, and now some students and affiliates are concerned about how his forthcoming administration will affect undocumented students. The president-elect’s vow to eliminate so-called “sanctuary cities” such as Cambridge that do not cooperate with the enforcement of federal immigration laws and begin aggressive deportation has been particularly disconcerting for many undocumented students on campus whose futures in this country are increasingly in jeopardy.
Students have called on University President Drew G. Faust and the Harvard administration to protect undocumented students on campus from detention or deportation, a move we wholeheartedly support. Recent emails from both Faust and Harvard University Police Department Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley have affirmed Harvard's commitment to protecting these students, and HUPD's long-standing policy of not inquiring into the immigration status of Harvard affiliates.
But student activists have also pushed Faust to officially designate Harvard a “sanctuary campus." Despite this call, Faust stated last week that she will not do in order to avoid potentially harmful, unintended consequences. We commend Faust’s prudent decision. The “sanctuary campus” label has an unclear meaning, and it unnecessarily puts the University—and by extension its affiliates—at risk.
Declaring Harvard a “sanctuary campus” would be nothing more than a symbolic  gesture. Because the term carries no legal weight, it offers undocumented students no tangible benefits. In fact, because it is so nebulously defined, it could end up being used as a pejorative—much like the term “sanctuary city,” the catch-all that inspired “sanctuary campus.” Over the past several years, “sanctuary city” has become a favorite term for conservative politicians to stoke fears about immigration.  It seems unwise and myopic for the University to create a new one in the form of “sanctuary campus.”
Even worse, adopting a potentially meaningless and politically-charged label will draw undesirable attention to the University at a time when lawmakers are preparing to step up immigration enforcement.  President-elect Trump has vowed to defund “sanctuary cities,” and some members of Congress have already called for the defunding of “sanctuary campuses.”
Harvard received nearly $600 million in federal funding last year—not to mention the massive implicit subsidy that comes from the tax deductibility of donations to the University. While we do not know how feasible it would be for Congress to punish Harvard for declaring itself a “sanctuary campus,” it seems foolish to tempt them with a label that offers the University and students such little utility.
Of course, we adamantly support the administration’s efforts to protect undocumented students on campus.  Faust is stepping up her lobbying for undocumented students in Washington, D.C., working with alumni to provide undocumented students with legal counsel, and appointing her chief of staff to coordinate advising efforts for undocumented students.
This is not to say that there is not more the University can do for undocumented students. It should work towards creating a central office to provide undocumented students with administrative, legal, and other services. Deportation is a human rights issue, and it is Harvard’s duty to protect its undocumented students, including those who have benefitted from Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and might lose their status under a Trump presidency, and those who never had protected status at all.
Nevertheless, University leaders do not exercise total control over this matter. It is ultimately up to our leaders in Washington, D.C. to do their jobs and enact comprehensive immigration reform so millions of Americans do not have to live in fear.  But until that happens, we urge the Harvard administration to step in and continue to do whatever they can to ease that fear in our community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Dec. 6, University President Drew G. Faust announced that she would not declare Harvard a sanctuary campus because “it would endanger, rather than protect, our students.” The claim that calling the campus a sanctuary campus would endanger its students is misguided. It’s common knowledge that undocumented students attend Harvard, and nothing about designating the campus a sanctuary campus would force individual students to disclose their immigration status. Those students who are already vocal about their status can be traced through coverage they have received in the media, and the declaration of Harvard as a sanctuary campus will only reassure them of the University's commitment to them.
Furthermore, this decision by Faust is in direct contrast with the demands that have been made by many undocumented student organizers and their allies. Students have repeatedly called for the administration to take the safety and mental health of all undocumented students into account by declaring Harvard an official sanctuary campus in addition to meeting other demands outlined in the petition “Protect Undocumented Students at Harvard.”
The role of administrators is to ensure that the needs of all Harvard students are met. This includes the right for students, regardless of any component of their identity, to feel safe on their own campus. By refusing to declare Harvard a sanctuary campus and failing to ensure their safety, President Faust is standing in direct opposition to that responsibility.  She is treating Harvard’s undocumented students differently on the basis of their immigration status. This is unacceptable.
The term sanctuary campus was recently created in response to President-elect Donald Trump’s hateful rhetoric against immigrants, his discriminatory policies towards Muslims, as well as his threats to deport millions of undocumented Americans. It is a term that carries not only symbolic significance, but also provides peace of mind and a guarantee that the University will protect its students in any case where they are under threat due to policies of the Trump administration. By refusing to call itself a sanctuary campus, Harvard is choosing to ignore its students who fear for their livelihoods under an unpredictable Trump administration by refusing to meet their needs.
In addition, while Faust has come out in support of the DREAM Act in the past, it is not enough to cite that as justification for her failure to take into account the unique needs of the undocumented students who attend schools across the University. Now more than ever, it is important for undocumented students to feel as though they belong and are safe on this campus, and that they are no different from any other student. It is also imperative that the administration do everything in its power to fulfill its commitment towards supporting these students by ensuring they have access to affordable legal services, culturally competent mental health services, and administrators who are familiar with immigration issues.
Instead of fearing the possible repercussions of declaring itself a sanctuary campus, Harvard should use its influence to set an example for other campuses as we approach the inauguration of a new president who has been very vocal about his views on the undocumented and Muslim communities. It’s not up to Harvard to dictate what is best for its students. Instead, Harvard must actively listen to their concerns and fulfill its duty to ensure that students can fully participate as members of the Harvard community. As part of its responsibility to meet the needs of the students, Harvard is obligated to provide administrative, legal, financial, and moral support to its undocumented students. The future we face is uncertain and unprecedented, and it is this institution’s responsibility to ensure that it is on the right side of history in combating bigotry by upholding the standards we’ve already set for ourselves as an institution.
While the immigration policies of Donald Trump will not be known until he takes office, the administration must take this moment to display complete support for protecting its undocumented students. Should they choose to shirk that responsibility, then they should at the very least provide a reasoning for not taking on the sanctuary campus label that does not unreasonably and inaccurately say that it would endanger the very students who have expressly demanded it in order to feel safe.
They should attempt to explain why the administration has deemed it okay to push undocumented students into the shadows and fail them in the time of their greatest need. While President Faust may not have intended for her statements to be construed in this manner, what her words clearly show is that Harvard is failing to stand in solidarity with the undocumented students on this campus. Those students deserve far better from their administration.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Between House renewal and its Allston land acquisitions, Harvard is primed to spend hundreds of millions of dollars by the end of the decade in developing its share of the Charles River waterfront. But rising sea levels, storm surges, and floods caused by climate change could place both that investment and the rest of the campus at risk of being washed away.
Recently released climate change vulnerability assessments conducted by the cities of Boston and Cambridge identified sea level rise, severe precipitation, coastal storms, and extreme heat as four areas of risk for the Boston area in the coming decades.
Of particular concern to Mia Goldwasser, Boston’s climate preparedness program manager, is the combination of storm surges and a rise in sea level leading to more severe flooding.
“Boston is one of the most vulnerable cities in the U.S.,” Goldwasser said, noting the particular geography and landscape of the city.
Boston could experience over $135 million worth of physical damage per year from sea level rise by 2030, according a report released last Thursday by Climate Ready Boston, an initiative of the City of Boston to prepare for the effects of climate change.
Harvard faculty has long studied the effects of climate change on cities and communities around the world, a fact often touted by University President Drew G. Faust in response to demands that Harvard divest its endowment from fossil fuel companies. Last week, the Office for Sustainability announced the University had reached Faust’s goal to reduce Harvard’s greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent from 2006 levels.
Now, however, faculty and administrators are confronted with a challenge closer to home and potentially more costly: how to protect their own campus against the threats posed by climate change.
UPSTREAM
Fortunately, Cambridge and communities upstream from Boston Harbor are currently protected from sea level rise and storm surge by dams on the Charles and Mystic Rivers, according to John Bolduc, Cambridge’s environmental planner.
“The dams protect us today very well; we don’t face storm surge risk today because the dams block any storm surge risk that would come in from the harbor,” Bolduc said. “But what we’re concerned about is that if sea level rise goes up… their ability to protect Cambridge is going to diminish over time.”
Bolduc further noted that models produced in collaboration with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation showed that storm surges will still be “extremely unlikely” to overtop the dams through 2030.
“The dams start to become compromised probably around the 2045 to 2055 timeframe, where a one-percent annual probability event, like a big hurricane or a big Nor’easter, could send a storm surge past the dams,” Bolduc said. “By 2070, with 3.4 feet of sea level rise, what would happen is that storm surges would go around the dams before they go over the top.”
More immediate concerns, according to Bolduc, are extreme heat, which can strain electrical utilities, and severe precipitation, which can lead to flooding.
Bolduc said that the Cambridge city government is considering doing “resilience audits” to better protect properties against climate change, and putting up flood barriers at “strategic locations.”  Future Cambridge zoning will also take climate change effects into account.
“We’re already giving developers guidance on what flood elevation they should design to,” Bolduc said. “We’re looking at different things that we can do at different scales: at the personal and building scale, at the neighborhood scale, at the city-wide scale, and then at the regional scale.”
HARVARD’S PLANS
Heather A. Henriksen, director of the Office for Sustainability, which coordinates climate resilience efforts at Harvard, indicated that the University was “cognizant” of the threats from climate change facing campus.
“Based on the data that we have seen, it’s really heat and extreme precipitation for the next several decades,” she said. “A much longer-term challenge, which the modeling is less precise on, is sea level rise and storm surges.”
Harvard is simultaneously pursuing resilience efforts both on campus and at regional levels, according to Henriksen.  She said the office is currently working with administrators and faculty members to develop a University-wide climate preparedness and resilience plan by 2020, and that Harvard has begun using internal resilience standards for University property.
Henriksen said critical infrastructure was raised in designs for the new School of Engineering Applied Sciences complex and renovations to Harvard Kennedy School to make the buildings more resilient to flooding. She mentioned elevating and moving an energy facility for the SEAS complex after a vulnerability assessment indicated flooding risks.
Henriksen said adding resilience measures to existing buildings will be a “longer-term challenge,” but the undergraduate Houses undergoing renovations will have cooling infrastructure installed to offset the effects of extreme heat in the future.  Also under consideration in resilience efforts are campus landscapes and the “permeability” of surfaces to water, according to Henriksen.
Robert Manning, Harvard’s director of engineering and utilities, indicated that climate change and resilience considerations are factored into the design of Harvard’s electric grid and noted that Harvard’s underground electrical cabling and distribution transformers in the renovated Houses are designed to be submerged.
"We have a very reliable system, because we have multiple upstream sources for different sections of the campus,” he said. “If you think of a flooding event, we could keep the power on in that area up to as long as the buildings are usable.”
Manning also said Harvard’s electric grid is prepared for the strains of heat-related electricity use. According to him, University buildings have two electric lines, either one of which can take the entire electrical load in the hottest possible hour.
For Harvard’s Blackstone steam plant, which is situated on Western Avenue next to the Charles River, most of the equipment is elevated “several feet above or even higher,” according to Manning, and there are currently efforts to “harden” other components of the plant against flooding and storms.  He added that the University is currently examining flood risks to Harvard’s steam tunnel system.
Despite Harvard’s own preparedness efforts, Henriksen noted that cooperation with local and state institutions is necessary for addressing long-term climate change threats, particularly sea level rise and storm surge. She said Harvard faculty were active in contributing to regional resilience and modeling efforts.
“Our greatest risk is external factors—the electric grid, the MBTA... We have 1,400 employees, not even counting faculty. How do they get to work?” she said. “These are regional challenges that we need to solve together. Harvard alone is not going to be at risk for the Charles River Dam.  Everyone is.”
‘THE DUTCH WAY OF THINKING’
Harvard experts echo Henriksen’s sentiment regarding the complicated and challenging nature of long-term climate resilience planning.
Carling Hay, an Earth and Planetary Sciences research associate, emphasized balancing uncertainty with risk in long-term estimates of sea level rise and storm surge.
“Projections [of sea level rise] up to 2050 are fairly consistent, regardless of what emissions scenario we choose.   It’s after that, after 2060 and towards the end of the century, that there’s a lot more uncertainty.  And that’s really due to uncertainty with what the ice sheets will do,” Hay said, adding that sea level rise up to today has mostly been due to thermal expansion of the ocean.
Hay, who advised the Boston city government in its climate vulnerability assessments, said planners and officials would have to decide on acceptable degrees of risk for different systems in considering climate resilience measures.
“If... you have something that has very low tolerance for risk, that’s [a] reason to plan for the higher end of sea level rise, because if storms do become more intense, or they do become more frequent, those flooding events will become more likely,” Hay said.
Jesse M. Keenan, an architecture lecturer at the Graduate School of Design, discussed the dual importance of resilience and adaptation in preparing for climate change.
Resilience, Keenan said, is about maintaining the status quo amidst climate change threats, while adaptation considers adjusting locales and individuals around the effects of climate change.
“The necessity to think of adaptation as a point and counterpoint to resilience is because there’s many circumstances where you may be resilient as a community or your actions may be resilient… but to another group or community, it’s maladaptive, and vice versa,” he said.
Keenan, who has advised federal agencies on climate change and disaster recovery, cited flood defenses as a potential example of “maladaptation.” Flood barriers allow buildings to be resilient to water damage but can also direct water onto other properties, creating flood risks that did not exist before.
“There’s a great deal of subjectivity about what it means to be resilient.  And you have to draw that boundary between hazard mitigation and just protecting yourself from risk and really challenging and thinking about the necessity to adapt,” Keenan concluded.
Bolduc echoed Keenan’s judgement on the importance of considering adaptation for Cambridge.
“There are going to have to be times when the city is just going to have to accommodate flooding,” said Bolduc. “It’s sort of like the Dutch way of thinking about flooding, ‘You have to live with the water at times.’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 14, 2016, at 2:43 p.m.
In the aftermath of a presidential election that many have heralded as signalling a new era for American politics, Kennedy School of Government Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf said his faculty will continue to analyze policies and produce evidence with a steadfast belief in their process.
“I think we can’t ever presume that other people have made up their minds so much that they are impervious to evidence,” Elmendorf said in an interview Monday. “It doesn’t mean that every research result from every paper can or should change people’s minds, but I think an accumulation of evidence does change minds, and that’s the business that we’re in.”
However, Elmendorf said the election underscored for him a new need for public leaders to craft a “compelling narrative” about their political aims, citing the example set by Donald Trump’s strength of vision that allowed him to connect with many voters.
“[W]e teach our students not just how to do analysis but how to communicate that work, how to talk about the policies they support and how to bring other people along to support those policies in the way that public leaders need to,” Elmendorf added. “I understand better now than I did a year ago how important that communication is for effective public leaders.”
Elmendorf, who directed the Congressional Budget Office from 2009 to 2015, also responded directly to criticism aimed at the Kennedy School for inviting President-elect Donald Trump’s chief strategist and former campaign CEO Stephen K. Bannon for a conference on the 2016 presidential campaign.
The two-day event, held after every election by the Institute of Politics, was entitled the “Campaign for President, the Managers Look at 2016,” and featured Hillary Clinton and Trump’s campaign managers, in addition to  a host of other political and media figures.
Harvard affiliates have criticized Bannon for the white-nationalist, anti-feminist, and anti-immigrant beliefs associated with the media outlet he formerly ran, Breitbart News. About 1,000 people responded to the protest’s Facebook event, but Bannon canceled his appearance the day before he was supposed to attend.
Though Elmendorf alluded to the criticism in his opening remarks published before the event, he went further in depth in Monday's interview, saying that the Kennedy School’s policy is to invite significant public figures regardless of how divisive their actions or words may be .
“I think it was right for the Kennedy School to invite Steve Bannon, it’s not an endorsement of his views by the Kennedy School or by me, but his words and actions have mattered importantly for what has happened to this country, and are likely to matter going forward,” Elmendorf said. “The right test is not whether I agree, or whether any particular person agrees, it is whether they have mattered in the world.”
The featured event of the program was a discussion between Trump and Clinton campaign managers Kellyanne Conway and Robby Mook, respectively, moderated by CNN anchor Jake Tapper. The event marked the end of two days of panels—some of which grew contentious. Elmendorf said  sparring between Conway and Mook, which made national news, was not a shock but “illuminating.”
“I’m new at the Kennedy School and I have not been here for any of the previous meetings of campaign managers. As a newcomer I was kind of surprised that that these past meetings have generally been quite sedate, because, in fact, these are people who have contended each other with every fiber of their being for months on end,” Elmendorf said.
As the Kennedy School prepares to adjust to life under a new presidential administration, Elmendorf said he does not think the White House transition will affect the way faculty engage with policy.
Rather, he said individual faculty members “will continue to weigh in on public policy as they see fit, based on the results of their research and their analysis.”
One effect of the transition may be a shift in personnel at the Kennedy School. Elmendorf said the school has been in conversation with officials from the Obama administration and that “some of them may come [to the Kennedy School] as faculty or fellows or speakers.”

The College admitted 938 early applicants to the Class of 2021 Tuesday, representing 14.5 percent of its 6,473 applicants for early admission and a five percent increase in early applicants compared to last year.
This year’s acceptance rate for early applicants is the lowest since the the Admissions Office reinstated its early admissions program in 2011.
The increase in early applicants follows a trend that has occurred each year since the nonbinding early action program returned, according to the Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67. Reflecting on the trend in an interview Tuesday, Fitzsimmons said admissions officers “also worry that too much of an emphasis on early admission” may pressure students into making hasty college decisions. 
“We don’t know where all this will go. We are hoping at Harvard that we may be somewhat leveling off, we hope, to the extent that that would encourage people to make lengthy thoughtful college choices,” Fitzsimmons said, emphasizing that for many prospective students it is advantageous to apply later because they can include more activities in their applications. In comparison, the College accepted 5.2 percent of applicants to the Class of 2020’s regular admissions pool, which included more than 39,000 applicants.
In a press release, Fitzsimmons said early admission “appears to be the new normal.”
The Class of 2021 is the first group of students at the College who would be affected by Harvard’s new policy penalizing members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations, such as final clubs, fraternities, and sororities.
While Fitzsimmons said diversity of the pool of early applicants has generally increased over the past several years, the demographics of the Class of 2021’s students admitted early vary little from last year.
Of the students admitted by the College, 12.6 percent were African American applicants this year, up three percent from the Class of 2020. The percentage of admitted Asian American applicants decreased slightly, with 21.7 percent admitted for the Class of 2021 compared to 24.1 percent last year. Latino students comprise 8.8 percent of the admitted pool compared to 9.5 percent from last year, and Native Americans and Native Hawaiians represent 1.1 percent, down from 1.6 percent.
The percentage of women increased slightly from last year,  with women representing 48 percent of the admitted students compared to 47.4 percent from the  Class of 2020.
“It does appear, say relative to the time when we gave up early admission, that there is greater ethnic and greater economic diversity in early pools these days, and therefore, in the admitted pool,” Fitzsimmons said.
The geographic distribution of students has remained primarily constant, as well, with a slight increase in students from the Midwest and a smaller percentage from southern and western states compared to last year.
The percentage of first-generation students admitted early is slightly higher than last year, representing 8.7 percent of the admitted class compared to 8.2 percent from the Class of 2020. The Admissions Office continued to prioritize recruitment of first-generation student, according to Fitzsimmons.
“This is very encouraging because there is so much talent out there among families where their sons and daughters will be first-generation,” he said. “We’re delighted, too, that first-gen status is something that more and more colleges are taking into account.”
This admissions cycle saw several application changes, including the new Coalition application as a possible platform through which students could apply to Harvard, in addition to a modified SAT exam, which went into effect in March.
According to Fitzsimmons, the vast majority of early applicants to Harvard used the Common Application, with only 39 submitting their applications through the Coalition application. Fitzsimmons was not surprised that few students chose the Coalition application because it is so new. He also said that it was still too soon for students to take full advantage of the Coalition’s defining feature, a “locker” where students can upload supplemental materials throughout the entirety of high school not just senior year.
The record number of early applicants since the reinstatement of the program in 2011 comes after a string of controversial events at the College, including the 22-day strike of Harvard’s dining services workers, reviews into sexually explicit reports on women that the College’s men’s soccer and cross country teams produced in past years, and continued scrutiny of Harvard’s policy on unrecognized single-gender social organizations.
Fitzsimmons believes, however, that prospective students will instead focus on Harvard’s positive features in the long term when choosing where to attend.
“I think over time there are more enduring values that people look at and more enduring factors that people look at as they make their college choices,” he said. “I think they’re all aware that there can be positive and negative events that can occur from year to year, and I think people are much more focused on the long term.”
Students applying for regular decision have until Jan. 1 to submit their applications. Decisions will be released to regular decision applicants on March 30, and all admitted students have until May 1 to reply to the College.

The Harvard Art Museums received over $1.5 million in donations this month for a new fellowship and summer program.
Business School alumnus Ken Hakuta announced a $1 million donation Dec. 1 that will go towards funding a two year fellowship for research on renowned 20th century artist Nam June Paik. Paik, who passed away in 2006, was Hakuta’s uncle.
The fellowship will be open to postdoctoral scholars and is meant not only to contribute to the existing scholarship on Paik but also to train the fellow for future jobs in curation, according to Mary S. Enriquez, the Harvard Art Museums’ associate curator of modern and contemporary art.
“[Paik] was a real visionary. He was not just a visual artist—he was a so many things and that’s why there is so much to research about him,” Hakuta said of the artist.
Enriquez concurred with Hakuta’s assessment of Paik.
“Paik was one of incredibly revolutionary artist who mixed music, sculpture, and performance. He fused things together in a really fresh, innovative way,” she said.
Hakuta said Harvard’s legacy as a training ground for leaders in the field of art history influenced his decision to donate.
“There’s a lot of synergy with what the Harvard Art Museums do,” Hakuta said. “I see that the top curators are Harvard educated and it's where the great art minds are trained.”
Enriquez said she was excited to work with the fellow because “new minds coming in helps us all learn and keep us vital.”
“This fellowship gives them experience for curating, doing research, and interacting with different audiences,” Enriquez said.
In addition to the monetary gift, Hakuta donated approximately 10 pieces of Paik’s work to the Art Museums’ Paik collection.
Four days after the Hakuta gift, the Art Museums received $506,000 from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. According to a press release, the money will go toward a summer institute for art history graduate students interested in “object-focused technical inquiry, methodologies, and instruction.”
The program’s first class of approximately 15 fellows from across North America will arrive in June 2017 and participate in two weeks of classes.
“The Summer Institute for Technical Studies in Art will expose emerging scholars and aspiring museum professionals to meaningful object-based experiences, and will help them establish a professional network committed to interdisciplinary collaboration in the areas of conservation and physical history of art,” Martha Tedeschi, the Director of the Art Museums, said in the press release.

UPDATED: December 14, 2016, at 4:41 a.m.
Staring at the computer screen, Mahmoud Hariri watched men guided only by the light of their smartphones salvage bodies from the rubbled remains of buildings. This attack occurred in Hariri’s hometown of eastern Aleppo, Syria, though he viewed the rescue efforts from the safety of Harvard’s campus.
Prior to his arrival at Harvard, Hariri provided trauma care as a surgeon in eastern Aleppo hospitals and trained junior physicians at a medical school he founded with colleagues two years ago. As political tensions and fighting in Syria escalated, Hariri’s family stayed in neighboring Turkey while he traveled back and forth between the two countries.

This fall, Hariri joined thousands of others in moving to Harvard for the beginning of the semester—but while many were coming back from internships and summer vacations, Hariri and four other scholars were escaping wars and oppressive regimes on a 10-month fellowship through the Harvard Scholars at Risk program.
Nearing its 15th year of operation, Harvard’s Scholars at Risk program—the largest chapter within a broader network—hosts scholars every year who are fleeing “dangerous conditions” and intends to provide a safe haven for scholars facing potential harm, which “may be related to the scholar’s work, but it may also be a consequence of the scholar’s ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or political opinions,” according to the program’s website.
While the fellowship only lasts 10 months, those involved with the program aim to make their time as productive as possible and set up scholars for success after Harvard.
A PROGRAM’S FOUNDING
On Human Rights Day in 1997, a NPR program on persecuted intellectuals prompted then-University of Chicago professor Katie Trumpener to email the university’s president and provost about the school’s relationship with academic freedom.
In the email, she discussed “the singularly important role” Jewish refugees from Germany played in the intellectual development of the University of Chicago in the 30s and 40s. She challenged the university’s leadership to consider establishing a fellowship for professors under contemporary oppressive regimes to find a place of “intellectual refuge and sanctuary,” or “a first place to catch their breath and think what to do next?”
After receiving a polite, but uninterested, response, Trumpener shared her ideas with then-director of the school’s Human Rights Program, Jacqueline Bhabha. Bhabha and her team embraced the idea and brought it to fruition.
In 1999, the Human Rights Program of the University of Chicago founded Scholars at Risk. With a MacArthur start-up grant, Bhabha, who currently co-chairs Harvard’s SAR program, hired lawyer and human rights activist Robert Quinn as the first program director for the international umbrella organization. He still serves in that position today.
Quinn said though the network has grown significantly in recent years, “at the same time, we have seen conditions worsen in a number of countries, so we are still racing to keep up.” Quinn noted that “there’s a huge well of goodwill in the higher education sector to see [Scholars at Risk] work.”
Harvard English professor Stephen Greenblatt, who served on the Executive Council of the Modern Language Association with Trumpener, said he learned of the program from her, and her motivations to create the program deeply resonated with him.
Greenblatt, current co-chair of the Harvard SAR, immediately set to work and spoke to then-University President Lawrence H. Summers about bringing the initiative to Harvard.
“It is exactly the kind of thing that a great university like Harvard needs to do more of—use our intellectual community to help advance intellectual progress and moral rightness,” Summers said, reflecting on the decision to introduce the program to Harvard.
HOLDING ONTO HOPE
Scrolling through the Facebook profile of a young man, Hariri brooded over the atrocities faced by his countrymen who are not able to flee.
“This guy, my friend, has been killed today morning. To be honest, I’m afraid when I’m opening the Facebook that I will find sad news,” he said.
From witnessing the death of a patient on his operating table during an attack on his hospital, to hearing about the death of the last pediatrician in Eastern Aleppo, uncertainty and loss are normal in Hariri’s life.
“They are losing their hope day by day,” Hariri said of his colleagues. “I feel myself guilty, leaving them and being here, just living safe with my family. In the meantime, there are people who are suffering and risking their lives.”
Following Hariri’s visit to Los Angeles two years ago to speak at an American College of Surgeons conference, he received an email from a medical student who had attended. The email informed him about Harvard SAR, and presented a nomination offer.
After deliberating with friends, Hariri decided the opportunity could be useful for advancing his work in Syria. He applied and was accepted.
Hariri’s story is harrowing, but it is not uncommon among the scholars accepted by Harvard for participation in the program. Other fellows this year hail from Cuba, Ethiopia, Iran, and Nigeria, with a sixth arriving in February, according to Harvard’s SAR program director Jane Unrue.
The seventh fellowship was awarded to Ethiopian scholar Bekele Gerba, who is currently incarcerated. This marks the first year in which the program has awarded a scholarship to someone in prison.
Past years’ scholars have included a Cambodian documentary filmmaker, a Uyghur historian, an Iraqi Shakespeare scholar, a Sri Lankan mathematician, and a Russian journalist.
Beekan Erena, one of last year’s fellows, escaped persecution by the Ethiopian government for challenging their treatment of the Oromo people.
A scholar, an educator, and an author, Erena has worked to liberate the Oromo people, the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia, from government oppression. In doing so, he became a target.
In June of 2014, while Erena was working with other scholars to develop curricula for the Oromia Education Bureau, government agents stormed in, took their photos, and demanded they stop working on the project. A few days later, Erena was forced into a car and driven to the notorious Maekelawi prison, where many Oromo activists are tortured.
This was but one of six incidents that year in which Erena was stalked, arrested, and beaten by government agents.
A year after the initial threats from the government, his doctoral program funding was discontinued because of his “inappropriate” research agenda.
Following his academic suspension, he received an email from Harvard Law student Kulani Jalata, an American student of Oromo descent, who had heard of his plight. She wanted to nominate Erena for Harvard SAR. Erena was initially skeptical. He said, “I looked it up and I was amazed. Is that from enemy, maybe from the government to cheat me?”
Erena took a chance, and with Jalata’s help, applied to the program and was accepted. He benefitted from the period of calm surrounding President Barack Obama’s official visit to Ethiopia in 2015 and was able to flee the country.
LIFE AT HARVARD
“People have come from situations of intimidation, extortion, torture, persecution, but they’re for the most part, not coming with an edge of bitterness but with a sense of hope,” Greenblatt said. This certainly holds true for Hariri and Erena.
While at Harvard, fellows often research and raise awareness about the issues plaguing their countries.
Unrue explained that protecting these scholars is the top priority, and that every case is unique. “We work with them to make as many connections for them as we can,” she said.
Hariri, hosted by the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, has dedicated his year to analyzing hospital data and disease prevalence during the war and continuing to build out his medical school.
From producing online courses for Syrian medical students and educators to acquiring support materials and funding for the school, Hariri likens himself to an octopus in “connecting people from different places and trying to put all of these resources in one basket.” In a consortium across universities including Yale and Albany, he facilitates collaboration on initiatives related to the medical school project.
Hariri said he works more than 20 hours per day, often waking up at 3 a.m. because of the time difference between Cambridge and Turkey and Syria. “Believe me, there is no time for rest,” he said.
Hosted by the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research, Erena’s research focused on ''The Oromo Student Protest Movement: Demands for Justice and Democracy in the Face of Ethiopian Government.” In addition to teaching an Oromo language class at Harvard, he also wrote 152 poems in English to try to improve his command of the language. He said he was excited to come to Harvard given its wealth of academic resources.

“When I came here, I saw 17 of my books in the library. I don’t know how they came to Harvard, but I appreciate Harvard because it is globally collecting every nation’s book. I was amazed,” Erena said. He was happy to find himself in “an ocean of knowledge.”
With government-controlled media, there are many untold stories in Ethiopia. Erena hopes to raise awareness of these stories through his academic work, creative writing, and thousands of social media followers.
But for some fellows, rest and recovery are needed after escaping traumatic circumstances. From receiving legal aid and psychological treatment to forming academic networks, Greenblatt hopes scholars have “a kind of world that is giving them some support and that they’re not just in a dark hole.”
While some SAR fellows openly interact with the Harvard affiliates, others cannot be identified in the same way out of safety concerns. Unrue said that being called a scholar at risk can be “a problematic label—maybe like dissident.”
As she does with many fellows seeking academic or research positions following their fellowship, Unrue is now helping Erena apply to doctoral programs in the United States. Erena currently teaches literature courses on revolution and survival at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, with the broader goal of eventually returning to Ethiopia and creating social change through education and his writing.
“My dream is to be voice for the African people wherever I am. If my country is appropriate for intellectuals, my wish is to go back and teach the generation, especially to work on their minds,” Erena said.
BEYOND THE PROGRAM
Harvard’s Scholars at Risk chapter relies on funding from a variety of sources, but with an unstable stream of funding, sustainability is a key concern of the program—even as administrators voice their continued belief in the importance of the program.
In a recent email soliciting nominations for next year’s class of Scholars at Risk, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote, “The support of American universities for scholars facing persecution because of their beliefs, scholarship, or identities has always been critically important. With threats to academic freedom rising across the globe, this support has only grown in importance.”
Over the past year, the Turkish government has exercised more control over educators and China’s president has sought to remove dissenting opinion in universities.
“Critical thinking is an activity absolutely supported by universities, or should be supported, but at times, that makes them targets for attack. Our professional networks should do what we can to help people,” Trumpener said.
Greenblatt said that, while the funding may fluctuate, Harvard SAR will continue to push for support.
“The University has been very generous and serious about this for now quite a few years, but the university budgets are under pressure. We know that,” Greenblatt said. “I’ve had and expect to have many conversations [with administrators] but it’s sometimes disheartening to realize that you have to go back so often to make the appeal and say look this is the situation we’re in as human beings, these are the people who are making claims on us.”
Upperclassman residential Houses also started hosting fellows two years ago, which has significantly decreased housing costs and provided an outlet for scholars interested in engaging with the undergraduate population, according to Unrue.
This past October, comedian Jimmy Kimmel joined sports personality Bill Simmons in an benefit show for the Harvard program.
“Jimmy has been a great angel for our program over the years,” Unrue said.
Bhabha said she is grateful for the generosity of supporters outside of and within the university, but internal funding remains a challenge.
“We have had gifts, and we have had donations, but I think when you’re at Harvard, people expect the wealthy university to support something like this,” she said.
From working on fundraising initiatives to helping scholars rebuild their lives, fellows and colleagues view Unrue as the undersung heroine of the program.
“She’s a force of nature, and she’s also a force for good,” Greenblatt said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If students were concerned about the limited number of upscale cafes near Harvard, then Blue Bottle’s impending move to Harvard Square should come as welcome news.
The small cafe chain based in Oakland, Calif., is bringing its single-origin brews to 40 Bow St., marking its 34th planned location and its first in the Boston area. It joins Flour and Tatte as some of the newest additions to the burgeoning cafe scene in the Square.
Students like Dominique N. Kim ’17 are looking forward to the cafe’s opening.
“I’ve had some over the summer in New York, and it was good. Nothing world changing but yummy,” Kim said. “I’m excited for yet another bougie addition to Harvard Square.”
The coffee shop is slated for a summer 2017 opening and will be located in the Bow St. storefront recently purchased by Hong Kong billionaire and prominent Harvard donor Gerald L. Chan. The building is located directly across from the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine.
According to Blue Bottle Coffee’s content editor Vera Kachouh, the coffee company was “drawn” to the literary and academic nature of Boston and the “energy” of Harvard Square.
“We visit bookstores and take walks on the Charles when we visit,” said Kachouh. “We like the idea of being the kind of coffee shop that would give a soul searching philosophy student or a thesis writing Ph.D. respite from the bustle of academic life—with delicious coffee, of course.”
The coffee company specializes in “single-origin” coffee, which is coffee grown in one geographic location. The company was founded in the early 2000s, and has locations in San Francisco, New York, and Tokyo.
“Blue Bottle makes sure that every cafe that is opened is unique to the neighborhood, city block, and building in which it is located,” Kachouh said. “We plan to open a cafe that will respond to the community of Harvard Square.”
In the Square, the cafe plans to offer a rotation of single-origin coffees as well as a lineup of blends and espressos. Kachouh says the establishment will also serve pastries and food items like liege waffles and avocado toast.
Denise A. Jillson, Harvard Square Business Association’s executive director, said she has already heard much “buzz” surrounding Blue Bottle Coffee’s impending arrival.
Blue Bottle’s storefront, which was formerly the home of the Hurst Gallery, was in need of much repair and is currently undergoing restoration, according to Jillson.
“The space where they will be is going to be a game changer for that little area of Mount Auburn Street,” she said. “It will help provide a focal point to the corner and hopefully bring more foot traffic to that area.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Kennedy School of Government has raised $570 million for its ongoing fundraising drive, surpassing its overall goal of $500 million, according to Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf.
The school raised $336 million during the “quiet phase” of its campaign, which publicly launched in May 2014. The campaign  is part of a record-breaking University-wide $6.5 billion fundraising effort, begun in 2013, which has already surpassed its overall goal.
Elmendorf said his predecessor, David T. Ellwood ’75, and the school’s development team “were incredibly effective at explaining to people why the mission of the Kennedy School matters and how they could help.”
“We are now up to $570 million, which is beyond the original target, but our goal is not to hit a particular dollar value,” Elmendorf, who assumed his deanship in January, said. “It is to find support for the worthwhile ideas that we have here, and people are responding to that.”
The money raised in the capital campaign will support a number of Kennedy School initiatives, most visibly the construction and remodeling of portions of their JFK Street campus. The construction will add six new classrooms, a dining area, open study spaces, and a redesigned courtyard.
Elmendorf said the construction is “going very well” and that the project is “on time and on budget.” The estimated budget for the project is $126 million.
Campaign funding will also support research on digital technology, according to Elmendorf. He said the school has focused on this research because of increasing interest in cyber security and how digital journalism shapes public opinion.
“Digital technology is transforming the way we are doing business, but governments are lagging on the way they are using digital technology to deliver governance, benefits, and services,” he said.
Elmendorf said the school may use funding to invite experts who understand how digital technology works inside their own political spheres.
The Kennedy School is also focusing on what it has termed “social innovation,” which, according to Elmendorf, concerns the question of who should be solving problems—the government, the private sector, or others. In addition, the school is emphasizing developing strategies to “increase economic opportunity” for people.
A $32 million gift from Bloomberg Philanthropies in August will fund a joint program between the Kennedy School and the Business School for mayors and mayoral aides that Elmendorf said will focus on teaching current mayors how to be most effective in their positions.
Most of the Kennedy School’s $570 million was not donated by alumni. Major gifts from non-alumni donors have included the gift from Michael R. Bloomberg, who received his MBA from the Business School, and a $15 million gift from Robert A. Belfer, a graduate of the Law School, for whom the Kennedy School’s Belfer Center is named.
“Most of our gifts do not come from alumni, they come from people who are worried about some aspect of the world and think that we can help,” Elmendorf said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Maille E. Radford ’17, Julius G. Bright Ross ’17, and Reylon A. Yount ’16 felt shock, followed by gratitude, when they found out they had been chosen as recipients for Marshall Scholarships.
The Marshall Scholarship, which funds post-graduate study in the United Kingdom, was created after World War II and founded by the British Parliament. Radford, Ross and Yount are three of 40 students from the United States selected for 2017 scholarships.
Radford, a resident of Dunster House, plans to study curatorial studies and the History of Art at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London. She grew up in Dallas, Texas, and said she was interested in art preservation from an early age. When it came time to decide on her field of study at Harvard, she applied for a joint concentration in Chemistry and the History of Art and Architecture.
Bright Ross, who grew up on Easter Island in the South Pacific, said he is also passionate about conservation, but of a different kind. He said witnessing a doubling of the island’s population, and seeing natural resources dwindle caused him to develop an interest in wildlife protection. An Integrative Biology concentrator in Adams House, he hopes to pursue a Ph.D. in Zoology at the University of Oxford.
“In a perfect world, I wouldn’t be needed as a conservationist, because everyone would understand how we fit into the ecosystems around us, so I feel like the first step in moving towards that goal is to really understand natural ecosystems and ecology,” Bright Ross said.
Yount, a Environmental Science and Public Policy concentrator in Lowell House, hopes to pursue an M.A. in Music in Development at SOAS, University of London.
Yount, who is from San Francisco, said he is passionate about the intersection between arts and sustainable development. He plays the yangqin, or Chinese dulcimer, and is also a part of the Silk Road Ensemble, a music group created by cellist Yo-Yo Ma ’76.
“There are a lot of artists who work to create the cultural conditions needed to build strong mindful communities, and my goal is to eventually go into arts management or producing to elevate that kind of work,” Yount said. “I’m excited to make a lot of music.”
All three students described how they felt in shock upon hearing they were selected as recipients. Radford said she called her parents right away, and Yount explained how receiving the award made him think about all the teachers who have helped him reach this achievement.
“It’s an incredible vote of confidence and it’s very galvanizing,” Yount said. “I feel like we have something to say and people are hearing it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a year and a half left in its capital campaign, the Graduate School of Design has raised $92 million out of its $110 million goal, though several key initiatives such as financial aid and building expansion lag behind.
“Graduate education financial aid has been more challenging to raise money for in this Harvard campaign than any of us anticipated,” the school’s Associate Dean of Development and Alumni Relations Beth Kramer said.
The campaign, however, has recently bolstered its financial aid fundraising. Since the school hosted its first fellowship fundraising event in the spring, the GSD has received multiple donations towards new fellowships.
On Oct. 25, the GSD launched the Zaha Hadid/Omniyat Fellowship Fund to provide financial aid to Middle Eastern students. The following week, the school created the Phil Freelon Fellowship, which will fund African American and other underrepresented architecture and design students to attend the school.
Kramer said the development team still has its work cut out for the school to continue raising money for financial aid.
“We believe there is a universal case to be made for financial aid whether it be undergraduate or graduate education, and I think that just hasn’t happened yet,” Kramer said. “We have to roll up our sleeves and start thinking about new ideas about how to make that case.”
The GSD is planning an expansion on its main building, Gund Hall, to accommodate its expanded faculty and student body but has faced difficulty mobilizing philanthropic support with construction plans still tentative.
“We need that architectural vision to go out and excite a donor base for that Gund Hall expansion, and we are in the planning stages of that right now,” Kramer said. Design School campaign co-chair Philip L. Harrison ’86 said he hopes that the GSD will be able to unveil a finalized building plan next spring.
Harrison said that the GSD will continue raising money after the official campaign end date in April 2018, particularly to help fund the building expansion. According to Kramer, the building will cost $60 million or more, and money will have to come entirely from fundraising.
Harrison attributed some of the campaign’s challenges to a less affluent alumni pool and the fact that “the whole discipline of alumni outreach and development is new to the GSD.”
“We’re developing something which didn’t exist in the past, and we hope to put the structures in place to lay the groundwork for future campaigns,” Harrison said.
Harrison said he hopes that recent movements to create partnerships with other schools will broaden the pool from which the GSD draws donations.
“Now with new relationships, the relevance of the GSD as it relates to other professions and disciplines is growing, and that is one way we measure our success,” Harrison said. “We see this as a more ambitious campaign than just raising funds but also raising the platform of the school.”
The campaign has raised $4 million over the last eight months. Harrison said he is confident that the school will hit its target by the April 2018 deadline.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Representatives from major stakeholders in Harvard Square participated in a roundtable hearing at Cambridge City Hall on Tuesday night that turned confrontational at times as attendees discussed the Square’s future.
The hearing, led by City Councillor Jan Devereux, chair of the Council’s economic development and university relations committee, was scheduled last month in light of recent developments in the Square that have provoked public backlash, such as the Harvard Square kiosk renovations.
The meeting began with updates from City councillors, City Hall employees, and Charles M. Sullivan, executive director of the Cambridge Historical Commission.
“I think it feels to many of us as though Harvard Square is in need something of an intervention,” Devereux said at the outset of the meeting. “I know this is a perennial conversation, but I think we’ve reached a point where we need that perennial conversation again.”
On behalf of Harvard, the University’s Director of Government and University Relations in Cambridge Thomas J. Lucey provided an update on Harvard’s many construction projects in the Square, including the renovation of the Smith Campus Center. The current renovation forced the relocation of b.good, the closing of Au Bon Pain among other restaurants, and occasional closures to Dunster and Holyoke Streets.
“From Harvard’s perspective, in terms of retail space we have, it’s 14 percent of the Square,” Lucey said, referring to Harvard’s local landholdings. “We’re interested in obviously a unique experience in Harvard Square; we’re committed to that.”
Harkening back to disputes over the Smith Campus Center’s design, Devereux called the Campus Center renovation “controversial.”
“I didn’t see it as controversial,” Lucey responded. “We’ve helped almost every single retailer relocate.”
For the most part, though, councillors were positive about Harvard’s role in the Square. Councillor Leland Cheung lamented that the city has not provided Harvard with a set of goals in recent years.
“I think what has been a little bit missing is we haven’t gone to the University,” Cheung said. “The last direction that Harvard got from Cambridge was that we boxed them in and said you can’t grow here anymore and that led to the development across the river.”
Also in attendance were attorneys from developer Equity One, a multinational developer with local holdings, and from Morningside, a venture capital firm founded by Harvard donor and Hong Kong billionaire Gerald L. Chan. The attorneys provided updates and fielded questions from the City Council.
Equity One has been involved in city politics for the past few months as it attempts to renovate the building that houses the Curious George store. After three separate meetings with the Cambridge Historical Commission, Equity One still has yet to receive approval for its proposed renovation.
“There is no expectation that anything will be happening in calendar year 2017,” said James J. Rafferty, a lawyer for Equity One.
Cheung spoke directly to Rafferty, asking him to tell managers at Equity One to keep the iconic Curious George shop. He proposed the council take up legislation to protect the Curious George store “at all costs.”
“To me it’s a dealbreaker,” Cheung said to applause.
Chan owns a number of buildings in Harvard Square, including Hotel Veritas and the building formerly occupied by Uno Pizzeria and Grill. Chan had intended to be at the hearing, according to Morningside representative Paula Turnbull, but Turnbull said he had a “dental emergency.”
Trumbull defended Morningside’s recent redevelopment projects on Mount Auburn Street and Church Street, despite criticism from the Council.
“I think that our rents are market-driven. The tenants who approach us want to be in the Square,” she said. “Gerald Chan has a great affinity for the Square. He’s purchased these properties for his commercial family enterprises with the intention of restoring it and making it as lively and attractive to the whole world.”
Also mentioned frequently at the meeting was the empty cinema on Church Street owned by Chan.
“If we want to talk about the big elephant in the room, we’ve got a dead theater in the middle of the Square. If they’re not going to do anything with it, I think the city ought to take it,” Cheung proposed.

In 2016, Harvard Law School grappled with the meaning and role of its past. The school’s history—how to define it, which parts of it to honor, and its role at a 21st century institution—surged to the center of campus discourse this past year as students, professors, and administrators debated whether the school should abandon its seal, which was the crest of a formerly slaveholding family.
In 2017, the school’s future, specifically its next 100 years, is shaping up to be the next potential sparring ground between some students and administrators at the school.
With the school’s 200-year anniversary approaching this spring, administrators have launched a rebranding efforts to commemorate the bicentennial that includes fundraising for the Law School’s current capital campaign and redesigning its official seal.
But some students have taken a different approach to marking the bicentennial. Some are raising questions about the overarching mission of the Law School and whether career trends among graduates that overwhelmingly favor corporate law fulfill that mission.
In October, second-year Law students Pete Davis and Nate Szyman launched an initiative called “The Third Century Project.” It challenges the dominance of corporate law firms in shaping Law School students post-graduate plans and aims to create a “Harvard Law School centered on legal vocation-building in the public interest.”
The first stage of the students’ project, called HLS 200, asks students and faculty to identify inspiring alumni, current legal challenges, and goals for the future. The Law School student government has committed to supporting the initiative as their official bicentennial activity, student government president Nino Monea said.
Next semester, Davis said, organizers will publicly present their project findings with the hope of asking people to consider whether the Law School is abiding by one of the missions stated on its website: “To educate leaders who contribute to the advancement of justice and the well-being of society.”
While administrators welcome student programming as part of the school’s bicentennial celebrations, they challenged the motivation behind the project, arguing that the school already encourages public service.
“The Law School equips students to pursue the widest array of opportunities of any law school in the world; subsidizes public service opportunities more than any other law school; and prepares students for careers that will likely combine both public service and private-sector employment,” Law School spokesperson Robb London wrote in an eight-page memo to The Crimson.
In recent years, the school has augmented public interest-related programs and seen an increase in the number of students pursuing public service careers. But some say a combination of market forces and financial incentives makes seeking corporate law jobs after graduation the default path.
A WELL-WORN PATH
Despite the school’s efforts to remove barriers for public service jobs, a significant majority of Law students still opt to work in the private sector instead.
However, in recent years access to public interest work for Law School students has improved.
In 2015, 14.5 percent of Law School graduates pursued jobs in public interest or government after graduation—a proportion that has doubled since 2007. Graduates who go into this work often find jobs in public defenders’ offices, government agencies, or non-profits.
Student interest in public service careers is “generally trending up,” according to Alexa Shabecoff, the assistant dean for public service in the Law School’s Office of Public Interest Advising.
Her office, the first of its kind nationwide according to Shabecoff, counsels students and provides information about career options in public service. The Law School’s Student Financial Services office also runs a loan repayment assistance program and provides funding to students who take public interest-related positions over the summer. And the school’s clinical programs advise students on pro-bono and clinical work.
Still, several students described corporate law as “the path of least resistance” at the Law School.
“There really is an unspoken understanding that the default option is to go into a corporate firm,” Monea said. “I think part of the [HLS 200] project is to normalize public careers as a perfectly normal thing that Harvard Law graduates do. It shouldn’t be viewed as a brave and noble sacrifice.”
Harvard is ranked eighth on Business Insider’s list of “The 25 Best Law Schools for Landing a High-Paying Job at a Firm.” In a 2012 National Law Journal study ranking law schools nationwide based on placement rates of graduates in government or public interest jobs, Harvard did not make the top 20.
Davis said part of his motivation for the HLS 200 project was his observation that many of his peers who entered the Law School intending to go into public service ultimately decide by their third year to take a job in the private sector instead. Shabecoff called this trend “a long-standing phenomenon at many law schools.”
While Law School administrators emphasize that graduates’ first jobs are not indicative of their full career trajectories, a variety of forces drive many students to take jobs in private firms immediately after graduation.
First, it is comparatively easier for students to get private sector jobs. The school’s Early Interview Program provides a near-guarantee of securing a lucrative position in a corporate firm before students have even completed half of law school.
“They really make it a very easy process to enter into corporate law,” third-year Law student Kezmen C. Clifton said.
More than 400 employers from private firms descend on campus each August for an intense five-day recruiting program. They conduct almost 11,000 interviews in that time, then fly students to their offices for final interviews. By the time classes start in the fall, many second-year students already have offers for summer associate positions for the following year—positions that typically lead to jobs after graduation.
“The jobs in the private sector pay a great deal of money, and we’ve got this amazing orchestrated structured program where employers are coming here just to hire our students, so it can be seductive,” Assistant Dean for Career Services Mark Weber said.
Meanwhile, Shabecoff said, public sector employers are often constrained by their budgets and unable to predict their hiring abilities as far in advance. They hire less consistently, on significantly later timelines. Fellowships, rather than summer associate positions, often serve as the pathway into public service.
Monea said he supports the HLS 200 project partly because he thinks the Law School should take measures to equalize these hiring processes, including moving the corporate timeline farther into the academic year.
“There are imbalances in the market forces,” Monea said. “I just want to make sure no one feels they have to do [corporate law] because of the way the market is structured.”
Weber acknowledged that the early corporate recruiting—part of a nationwide timeline set by the industry—is “less than perfect.” But he said the Law School is reluctant to push it back for fear that their peer institutions would gain an advantage.
The school has instituted a rule, however, that employers who recruit on campus must allow students up until April 1 to respond to an offer, enabling students to apply for jobs in the public sector or private firms with later timelines before making a final decision.
But in addition to mismatched application timelines, there are more jobs opportunities for Law School graduates at private firms.
“There are also simply fewer public service jobs than there are positions in law firms,” Shabecoff wrote in an email. “As a result, those jobs are more competitive.”
Market forces in a “time of unprecedented upheaval in the supply and demand for lawyers” are often out of the school’s control, London wrote.
“Educational institutions cannot make up for the inability of the public sector to provide sufficient job opportunities, but HLS makes every effort to subsidize opportunities for service where there are no paying jobs available in the job market,” he wrote.
MONEY MATTERS
 Money is another significant factor in students’ career decisions. About 80 percent of Harvard Law students graduate with loans, and the average debt for the most recent graduating class is $153,000, according to Kenneth Lafler, the Law School’s assistant dean for student financial services.
Managing significant debt on a public sector salary can be “crushing,” third-year Law student and president of the Women’s Law Association Natalie D. Vernon said. Vernon entered the Law School intending to work for a private firm, but became more interested in the public sector. She said choosing that path will likely entail financial challenges.
“Students who want to pursue public service immediately upon graduation certainly face financial obstacles that may make it more difficult for some to pursue this path,” Shabecoff wrote. “Obviously, the pay differential is often huge.”
“Big law” firms have begun to offer starting salaries of $180,000, the American Bar Association reported last summer. By contrast, a 2012 study by the National Association for Law Placement found that median starting salaries for public interest and public sector employees range between $43,000 and $50,500.
Clifton said she decided to work at a private firm in Chicago after she graduates in the spring because of its specialty in employment law and the type of training the firm offers. But for some of her friends, starting salaries factored significantly into their decisions.
“[To] start at $180,000 coming out… I think that’s very attractive, especially when you have hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans,” she said.
To prevent debt from serving as a barrier to entering public service, the Law School created the Low Income Protection Plan in 1978. LIPP, which was the first law school loan repayment assistance program in the country, helps graduates who work in the public sector or in certain qualifying private firms repay their loans. The number of graduates enrolled in the program—111 from the class of 2015— has more than doubled since 2008, and the amount LIPP provides has tripled in that time, according to Lafler.
Lafler said his office presents information about the program to all incoming students and offers one-on-one counseling sessions. He believes his role is to make students aware of the financial realities they will face in different career scenarios.
“It doesn’t equalize the drastic income difference between public sector work and private sector work. We always are very clear to make sure people understand that you’re going to be living a middle class life on a LIPP salary,” Lafler said. “We want to make sure that people have realistic expectations so they don’t get themselves into a position they feel is untenable.”
Vernon sees the HLS 200 project as a means of pushing students, and the school, to ensure students make career choices based on interests rather than financial considerations.
“I would love to see the school reimagine and re-envision themselves to make sure that the school speaks to every student’s passion, not just to their wallet,” Vernon said.
DIFFERING GOALS
While Law School students and career advisers share a desire to minimize the impact of external forces on graduates’ career decisions, the HLS 200 project has illuminated a disagreement between many of its student supporters and administrators over the role of the Law School in career advising.
Davis thinks employment trends favoring private law indicate that the school is facing a “crisis of responsibility” and failing to fulfill its mission. In his view, the school should proactively steer students toward public service careers and away from the private sector.
“HLS 200 is a cultural project. It’s trying to make a cultural change,” he said. “I don’t think Harvard Law should be satisfied until the majority of our students are working for organizations after Harvard Law School that primarily serve to advance the legal needs of the vast majority of Americans.”
But faculty and administrators argue that many students are simply interested in areas of law better suited to corporate firms. The job of the school, they say, is to help students evaluate employment options and prepare them for successful careers across sectors.
“Our goal is not to steer people into the public sector or the private sector, but to help them figure out what they want to do,” Weber, the career services adviser, said. “We don’t make assumptions, and we respect and support the choices of all of our students. Period.”
Administrators emphasized that people’s tendency to characterize the public and private sectors as polar opposites can be misleading, and there may not be a divide at all.
“That’s a false dichotomy, and fails to take cognizance of critical collaborations between private and public sector lawyers on litigation, advocacy, and reform agendas,” London wrote.
Career advisers across the Law School said graduates often transition between sectors, and those in private firms often do pro-bono work or projects that serve the public interest.
Law professor I. Glenn Cohen was an early contributor to the HLS 200 project, but he envisions the objective of the initiative differently than Davis.
“For me it is not corporate versus public interest at all, instead it is about vocation,” Cohen wrote in an email. “The goal is to make our students, secular or religious, feel as though they have found a calling that gives meaning to their life. That is highly desirable whether they go to public or private service.”
In the spring, Davis and Szyman will launch the second portion of the HLS 200 project, which will include an activism campaign around the feedback they collect.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

If anyone had any doubts regarding senior co-captain Siyani Chambers’ health coming into the 2016-2017 men’s basketball season, those doubts have been silenced.
Chambers withdrew from Harvard in 2015 after tearing his ACL during a summer workout. The Ivy League does not allow players to red shirt or play as graduate students, so players must leave school if they wish to preserve athletic eligibility.
Through the first eight games of the young season, much of the media focus on the Crimson has been on its rookie class, and the attention is certainly not without merit. Freshman forward Seth Towns currently leads the team in scoring with 13.9 points per game—and 21 per game during the team’s three game win streak, earning Ivy Rookie of the Week. Guard Bryce Aiken has also been a bright spot, providing a complement to Chambers in the backcourt. Rookie forward Chris Lewis had a breakout game against Boston College with 22 points while shooting at a 75 percent clip.
But Chambers has quietly been building an impressive stat sheet of his own, particularly in the assists categories. The Golden Valley, Minn. native is currently tied for third in all of Division I men’s basketball with 7.9 dimes per game. In the Ancient Eight, the next closest player—Yale point guard Anthony Dallier— has only 4.2 per contest.
By finding his teammates, Chambers makes everyone around him better. In Harvard’s three Division I wins (Chambers did not play against Div. II Fisher after getting banged up in the Crimson’s season opener against Stanford), the co-captain is notching 10.7 assists per game, compared to just 5.8 in losses. Not only does Chambers find his teammates, he protects the ball. Against Northeastern and Boston College last week, the senior had a combined 22 assists, but just a single turnover.
Chambers’ dribbling and ability to find teammates in traffic has been key over the past week, especially as Harvard has had to preserve leads late in games. Against Boston College on Dec. 7, the Crimson clung to a 69-63 lead. Despite leading by as many as 18 points, the Eagles were mounting a late comeback. To slow the Harvard offense, Boston College applied full court pressure, swarming Chambers as soon as he received the ball in bounds. Despite the pressure, Chambers evaded the pack and found Bassey streaking down the floor for an uncontested layup to give the Crimson some breathing room.
“[Siyani]’s in a really good place with the balance of scoring and finding people,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said after Harvard’s win over Northeastern on Dec. 6. “I do think he’s in a really good rhythm of seeing things, shots are falling, he’s hitting his spots, and it’s nice to see that out of him. He deserves that.”
Perhaps his most noticeable impact, however, comes in his leadership role on the team. In an ever-changing starting lineup, Chambers is a constant. From tip off to the final buzzer, Chambers is talking to his teammates constantly on the floor. For him, communication has been something the team has needed to improve on so far this year, and he sees it as his job to take the lead with that task. Averaging just under 32 minutes per game, Chambers embodies the “quarterback” title that Amaker looks for in a point guard.
Having a competent quarterback on the floor is especially important this year, with seven freshmen on the team trying to insert themselves in a team that struggled to a 14-16 record just a season ago. The freshmen have consistently pointed to the leadership of Chambers on and off the court as instrumental to their growth as players so far this season, both on and off the court. As it goes through the growing pains of a young team, Chambers has used his veteran status to teach the identity of Harvard basketball.
“He’s the best point guard I’ve ever played with,” Towns said. “He’s in the locker room making sure we’ve got all our work done, teaches us life lessons….On the court, his energy and motor carries our team. We’re looking at him, everybody on the team knows we’re looking at him for the leadership role.”
But ask Chambers to discuss his successes, and he pushes the attention to his teammates and to the bigger picture outcome—whether his team came out with a “W”.
“[H]e’s doing things like having 13 [points] and 11 assists, you wouldn’t even know,” Towns said. “Especially if you talk to him, he doesn’t boast about anything. Everything about him is win first, and that’s what matters most.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 14, 2016, at 2:30 a.m.
There once was a time when Harvard ruled the ECAC.
As soon as the men’s hockey conference dropped to 12 teams in 1984, Crimson coronations became standard practice. In the first 10 seasons under the new structure, Harvard captured as many as seven  regular season championships.
By the time the last was secured in 1994, success had evolved into such normality that one Crimson skater was quoted after the championship-clincher as saying, “Ah, whatever.”
Of course, this quote may be taken out of context. After all, I wasn’t there that night at the Bright Hockey Center. In fact, much like the vast majority of today’s Harvard roster, I wasn’t alive to see the Crimson shrug off its last regular season title.
I have, however, seen the shrugging persist—just not the good kind. In the two decades following that 1994 ’chip, Harvard seesawed between contender and pretender, trending more towards the latter. The Crimson put together just seven  winning seasons in those 20 years, while nine  different schools—none of them Harvard—took turns as league champs.
These days have a different feel to them. The Crimson’s been back in contender mode for the last three seasons, and right now, the polls  are calling Harvard (8-2-1, 4-1-1 ECAC) the fourth best team in the country.
Unfamiliar waters, these are not. Two years ago, the Crimson skated into the winter layover with identical resume bullet points: a No. 4 ranking and just one loss in conference play. But as injuries piled up and the schedule grew increasingly compact, the team crumbled. A postseason run would eventually salvage the season, but Harvard dropped all the way from first place in January to sixth by March.
A year later, the Crimson avoided a second-half collapse but could not eclipse an unsurpassable frontrunner. Quinnipiac led the ECAC from start to finish, piecing together a remarkable 16-1-5  run through the conference to earn its second consecutive regular season title.
To the surprise  of Bobcat coach Rand Pecknold, Quinnipiac was tabbed the ECAC favorite again this year, even after the departure of four all-stars—its two leading scorers, a star goaltender, and a point-producing blue-liner.
As it turns out, the coach was onto something. The Bobcats (10-7-2, 6-4-1) have already lost  three more games than they did all of last year, both overall and in conference play. Quinnipiac still boasts one of the most talented rosters in the league, but the Bobcats’ stranglehold on the conference has all but evaporated.
That means one thing. For the first time in 23 years, Harvard is going to retrieve its crown.
The first third of this Crimson campaign has provided ample evidence to corroborate this conclusion. Harvard’s been the better team in all but one of its first 11 contests—a tightly contested road battle with No. 6 Boston University that eventually went the hosts’ way. The Crimson’s only other loss—a road defeat at Quinnipiac—was the product of a goaltender’s off-night and a gaffe by a third-pair defenseman. Harvard largely carried the play against the defending ECAC champion for the first time in over a year.
With the nation’s third most prolific offense and a top-ranked power play unit, the Crimson has found a way to pummel contenders. A Boston College team ranked third in the country, a St. Lawrence squad unbeaten in the ECAC, and a Clarkson crew riding an eight-game win streak were all left in the dust after Harvard put together strings of four or more consecutive goals against all three.

Right now, the Crimson looks one step ahead of its ECAC competition. Like any team, Harvard has holes it should patch—its penalty kill has struggled, and its goaltending has been good, not great—but these trenches just aren’t deep enough to prevent the Crimson from topping the conference.
A discrepancy in games played currently has Harvard in sixth, but the Crimson is one of three ECAC teams with only one loss. The biggest surprise of the first half, Union (12-3-2, 8-1-1) stands four games ahead of Harvard in the win column. Yet, the Dutchmen have only beat one team in the upper half of the league standings—Quinnipiac, who somehow lost despite outshooting Union by an absurd 54-17 margin. Thus, as their schedule grows harder, the Dutchmen feel destined for a regression.
Then there’s St. Lawrence (10-5-4, 7-1-2), who’s only been bested in ECAC play by the Crimson. The Saints have been the conference’s top defensive team by a significant margin, and they’re scoring at the league’s third best clip. There’s a distinct possibility the regular season finale at the Bright between St. Lawrence and Harvard could determine the league champion; but that’s a game the Crimson should win.
Rounding out the shortlist of contenders, Cornell (7-3-1, 4-2-1) could be a dark horse if it can get healthy, and Clarkson (9-7-3, 5-3-1) has shown promise as well. And of course, there’s Quinnipiac, the team that left the door to the ECAC open in the first place.
Come March, any of these teams could capture a postseason championship, regardless of where they finish in the standings. Yet, there’s a reason why MLB teams pop champagne after winning their division and why NBA teams raise banners commemorating the equivalent. After a season-long grind, there’s something to be said about the team that claws its way to the top.
By regular season’s end, there too will be something to be said about this Crimson team. And I promise it won’t be “Ah, whatever.”
