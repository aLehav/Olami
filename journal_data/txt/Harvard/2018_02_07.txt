After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It wasn’t supposed to be like this.
When R&B singer and confirmed goddess SZA descended from the aether onto the Grammy’s stage to bless us all with a heavenly rendition of her song “Broken Clocks”, the mood was bittersweet. Despite receiving five nominations for producing what was widely considered to be one of the best albums of the year, SZA walked away from the telecast empty-handed. In response to any of you—and by “you,” I mean the Recording Academy—with doubts as to SZA’s magnificence as both a musician and a performer, I present the music video for her single “Drew Barrymore.”
 Directed by Dave Meyers (the genius behind videos for Kendrick’s “HUMBLE.” and Missy Elliott’s “Work It”), the video opens with an aerial shot of the New York City skyline, panning quickly to the interior of a disheveled apartment. The floor is littered with empty wine glasses and sleeping bodies, still in flashy clothing from the night before. A weak spotlight shines on SZA, gazing up at the camera from a couch, as she sings the opening line:
“Why is it so hard to accept the party is over?”
What seems at first glance to be like any other hangover-dazed morning suddenly becomes intensely and unapologetically lonely. The loneliness is an undercurrent—it fades in and out, but never quite goes away. The group descends from the apartment and into the streets of New York City. While SZA is far from the first artist to use the Big Apple as a muse, there is an authenticity to the shots that can’t be denied. She waltzes across crosswalks and into pizza places, and it feels completely natural. The day fades very quickly back into night and the camera cuts to a montage of SZA and her friends sledding, falling, and laughing in the snow. Just when you’re starting to feel the warmth of the scene, it gives way to SZA squatting in front of a wall of spinning washing machines, alone and naked save for a pink veil and a pair of heels, delivering one of the most vulnerable verses of her career.
At this point, a visual pattern has begun to unfold. Each time the viewer becomes accustomed to SZA within her group, she is suddenly alone. And just as rapidly as she becomes alone, she is once again surrounded by people. The transitions seem to coincide with the intimacy of the verse she is singing. It all comes to a head when SZA sneaks out of another party to smoke and Drew Barrymore herself comes into frame. The actress lingers just long enough to toss a small smile in the singer’s direction before disappearing into the night. Barrymore’s presence is a reminder of her struggles with insecurity and identity both onscreen and off, which were profound sources of inspiration for SZA.
Don’t blink—each shot is packed with so many little references and allusions you’re almost guaranteed to miss something. It could be a haunting neon sign, or perhaps a jawbone with a joint hanging out of it. I won’t spoil the rest in hopes that this might further persuade you to watch and look for them yourself. At its core, “Drew Barrymore” is an honest reflection on loneliness and longing. It is rife with the self-doubt that comes from the end of a romance, but there are small moments of assurance. At the video’s conclusion, the whole group is on the roof. It is morning again. SZA and two other women fall into the snow together at the edge of the rooftop and laugh.
All this to say: SZA, if you’re reading this, you deserved better.

In a poem from her most recent collection, “The Nightlife” (2017), Elise M. Paschen ’81 depicts Salvador DalÍ immersed in a dream reverie meant to inspire his artwork. She writes “that the artist, straight-backed / in bony armchair, would doze, heavy key between thumb / and forefinger. That the clatter of metal hitting the tin plate beneath / his hand, wakes him up: a Capuchin monk technique.” Paschen, like Dali, synthesizes her art from her unconsciousness. In her waking life, though, she has penned works including “Bestiary,” “Infidelities,” “Houses: Coasts,” edited many anthologies, founded the Poetry in Motion program in New York, and served as Executive Director of the Poetry Society of America. The Harvard Crimson spoke to Paschen over the phone about the creativity that arises from dreams, her coming anthology, and her memories of studying English at Harvard.
The Harvard Crimson: What was your process for writing “The Nightlife?”
Elise M. Paschen: I’ve always culled from my dreams in my work. In “The Nightlife,” I did it more deliberately. There are just a couple of poems where I say it’s a dream, but many of them arose from dreams. They arrived like mini-novels, or like a film. I could see the whole poem play out. I’d wake up and notate the dream.
THC: Tell me about one of the poems from “The Nightlife” that came from a dream.
EMP: There’s a poem called “The Week Before She Died,” and in that poem I do acknowledge that it came from a dream. My mother was the prima ballerina Maria Tallchief. There was a time when I was thinking about writing a prose piece about the summer when she and my father were separated and she became involved with the dancer Rudolf Nureyev. My mother and Nureyev flew to Denmark, where she was supposed to perform with Erik Bruhn, the Danish dancer. She introduced Bruhn to Nureyev, and Nureyev and Bruhn fell in love. It was this love triangle. I ended up not writing the prose piece, but a week before my mother passed away, I had this very vivid dream which I feel like distilled the elements of the prose piece.
THC: Your dreams are very productive.
EMP: In college, I would be studying something and I would have a dream and it would help me figure out how to write my paper. When you think about something a great length, sometimes your unconscious [self] will help you work it out, help you see different levels you haven’t seen before. I’m an insomniac, as well.
THC: What are you working on now?
EMP: I’m currently working on a new anthology called “The Eloquent Poem.” We’re hoping that it will be used in classrooms, colleges, and writing programs to help inspire learners and teachers of poetry to write poems. That anthology is based on the work I’ve done as a professor teaching in the writing program at the School of Art Institute of Chicago. Each chapter is based on a mode or a form of poetry. We’ve asked contemporary poets to contribute their own work to the anthology and to write a paragraph about the genesis of the poem and how his or her poem fits into that section of the book. It’s going to come out in spring of 2019.
THC: Are you working on a new book of your own poems?
EMP: I wish I was working on a new book of poems! When you finish a book of poetry and you’re starting to write a new book of poetry, you want to figure out how to do it completely differently than the last book. So I’m hoping to do something that doesn’t have anything to do with dreams.
THC: Why is it important to keep studying literature?
EMP: No matter what you end up doing in your life, if you have a strong grounding in literature, it will serve you throughout the rest of your life. I think that for all of us, when we think about fiction or novels, there are so many that have made such a deep impression on our lives. I harken back to the things that I’ve read in literature as I look upon reality. At the beginning of autumn, John Keats’s lines of “To Autumn” come to my mind. When I’m by the ocean and discovering tide pools, I think about that wonderful scene in “To the Lighthouse” by Virginia Woolf. Many things that we’ve learned through literature inform our sense of how we perceive the world.
THC: What are some of your favorite Harvard writing memories?
EMP: I loved my time at the Harvard Advocate, where I was eventually the poetry editor, so I want to encourage students to pursue these interests.
I lived on campus my last year [of college], on Scott Street. I was recently in Cambridge to give a reading, and my former landlady gave a book party for me. It was so nice to be back in the house, because I lived up in the garret, and it was such an inspiring place for me to live. I remember writing a lot of my poems there.
One of my great memories was, as a senior, walking over to 33 Kirkland Street, where the English department was. I had these independent tutorials with Richard Tillinghast the poet. I remember these spring days, magnolias blooming, and how much I loved Cambridge and loved working with this professor and creating poems.

The A.R.T.’s new show “HEAR WORD! Naija Woman Talk True” premiered Jan. 31 at the Loeb Drama Center to the sound of pounding drums. It seems almost incredulous to think that such a riveting show took three years to make its way to Cambridge after members of the Harvard Center for African Studies first saw it in Lagos. The show has a short run, closing on Feb. 11. But it manages to pack heavy emotion, incredible music, and acting all into one performance.
Written by the brilliant Nigerian writer and director Ifeoma Fafunwa and featuring a stellar cast of ten Nigerian actresses supported by three percussionists, this production seeks to share the experiences of Nigerian women of all ages. It dives straight into their struggles with relationships and gender identity through a series of vignettes delivered through monologues, dancing, and singing. What makes this show so cohesive is not only its powerful feminist message, but also its ability to balance comedy and tragedy as it transports its audience through vivid and often painful to watch scenes.
The set itself is plain. The musicians sit at their various drums on the sidelines as the actresses move on and off the stage to deliver their stories. The stories are told in retrospective under a single, bright spotlight, inviting the audience directly into the narrative. The actors dress in traditional Nigerian dresses and turbans paired with glinting hoops and jewelry. Each vignette lasts about ten minutes and is accompanied by drumming and metallic clicks, which at times mimic sounds like a phone ping from the story, but also serve to create an ominous feeling.
The script is simple and direct, a confession that often plays with poetic language chock full of Nigerian colloquialisms. Fafunwa does not hold back on her subjects, addressing themes like marital abuse, rape, sexual harassment in the workforce, underage pregnancy, widow confinement, and sex. Each topic addresses various viewpoints as the stories encompass all ages and experiences. For example, the scene “My Daughter-In-Law” delivers an anachronistic view of a woman’s role in the household. It is told from the perspective of a woman frustrated with her daughter-in-law, who refuses to believe that her place is in the kitchen. In “George,” a young university student gives the audience a distressing account of her rape.
One of the best scenes of the show, “Azuka & Temilola,” captures the humor and empathy that characterizes the overall production. It centers on two mothers holding a one-sided conversation with their daughters. One woman is a traditional Nigerian mother while the other is a Nigerian mother who has immigrated to London. Despite these cultural differences, they both critique their young daughters’ single lives. Actresses Joke Silva and Elvina Ibru are fantastic in their roles, perfectly delivering the excessive personalities of women desperate to marry off their girls.
The show’s strengths also lie in its ability to address the pain of abuse and harassment. One such scene, “Dodo,” recounts a young teenager’s experiences with molestation by her aunt’s fiancée and the silence enforced by her own unsympathetic family. Odenike beautifully portrays the girl’s youth and anger after she is molested. She struggles with processing her experience into words. Aside from the agony, bubbling bouts of humor are carefully weaved in. It touts the line between these two emotions very finely. The ability to achieve this balance so flawlessly is due to the masterful script and to the actresses who handle the conflicting feelings with care.
More than ever, works like these about women that recount both horrible and empowering experiences must be shared. It seems that these kinds of conversations are gaining more traction—and they should. We should especially remember Fafunwa’s influential words now more than ever: “The glory of our nation will rise if we utilize the energy we use to oppress women / To uplift, embrace and help one another grow.”

Showing on Feb. 2 and 3 at the Emerson Cutler Majestic Theatre in Boston, Ballets Jazz Montréal’s new production “BJM/Les Ballets Jazz de Montréal” set lofty goals for itself. The show’s three acts sought to subvert the Western conception of the patriarchy, pay tribute to Leonard Cohen, and capture the free spirit of Cuban dance, but despite these intention, the program was not entirely successful in its mission.
From the start, the show was plagued with technical difficulties, such as the emcee Susan Weiler’s microphone failing to turn on. This minor error foreshadowed not only later logistical issues, but was also symbolic for the show on the whole: The voice and message were there, but they would be drowned out in a sea of spectacle.
The troupe’s opening dance, “Casualties of Memory,” attempted to promote an egalitarian message but lost focus and was ultimately unsuccessful. It began with a male-female pair of dancers who engage in a beautiful, technically skilled routine in which each dancer’s movement complemented the other. No movement was distinctly male or female, and no one dancer dominated. This gender-neutral approach complements the stated aim of the piece completely.
The message was further complicated when the tempo suddenly picked up. eavy North African percussion instruments replaced soft, droning strings. As the rest of the troupe entered the stage, the dance changed from elegant to explosive, with performers contorting their bodies with such force and speed that it is a wonder how they continued for forty minutes.
At various points during the performance, dancers waved their hands above their heads while jumping and breaking out into ululation and shrieking, presumably in a homage to the culture from which they borrowed their drums. While this part might have been intended to blend ethnic and contemporary dance in such a way as to emphasize gender equality, the connection between powerful North African-inspired movements and subverting the patriarchy did not make much sense.
In fact, this new element drowned out the original feminist message. At other points, the egalitarian themes shone through more clearly like when the dancers arranged themselves in a gender-neutral fashion and pas de deux pairings subverted traditional notions of a male-female pairing. While the dancers themselves performed unbelievable feats masterfully, the choreography was crushed under the weight of its own message.
“Dance Me,” a four part homage to fellow Montréal native Leonard Cohen, was the peak of the show. Conceptual, focused, and deeply touching—each performance was a meditation on the late artist’s work. Andonis Foniadakis’ choreography to Cohen’s “Boogie Street” was so sensual, smooth, and deeply satisfying that one almost gets the sense that the song was commissioned for the dance and not the other way around. The silky movements of “Boogie Street” and the stunning vocal rendition of “Marianne” provided a much needed reprieve from the violent moves of the first act. “Dance Me” ended with a moving depiction of Cohen’s song “Suzanne.” Here, the dancers intertwined and connected intimately to mimic the way Cohen describes touching the body of your lover “with your mind.”
Off the heels of the deeply emotional and intimate “Dance Me” comes the show’s “O Balcão de Amor,” which had a physical and slapstick nature that was at times detrimental. Inspired by the choreographer’s trip to Cuba, the piece is supposed to be loose, sexy, and full of absurdity. However, much like the rest of the show, it toed the line between homage and caricature. The performers changed out of the tights they sported for the majority of the show, and instead wore costumes to represent their personality in the piece. For example, the main character—a bumbling nerd—was dressed in a bowtie and suspenders. While the performers nailed the choreography, the overdone skits ruined whatever physical feat and artistic mastery may have been there.
Frequent technical difficulties dampened the mastery of the choreography. Halfway through the performance the music stopped, but the performers continued their repertoire without missing a beat. The curtain closed and the lights dimmed. While this might have seemed like it was a part of the performance, it was just a technical error and forced the production to restart.
Besides the suspect cultural homages, the overdone slapstick, and technical errors, Ballets Jazz Montréal had a great show. There were moments of genuine emotion without pretension that were impactful; however, the majority unfortunately got lost in superfluity.

In a joint statement released in late January, the Harvard School of Public Health joined 16 other schools in refusing funds from the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World. They cited concerns that the Foundation is funded by, and too closely associated with, Philip Morris International, a multinational cigarette and tobacco company. Although the School of Public Health’s rejection of these funds is not itself praiseworthy, we are glad that the it has upheld basic ethical standards for academic research.
It is worth noting that Harvard scientists have a history of accepting unscrupulous funding from suspect sources. In one example from 1967, Harvard scientists published a study on the effects of sugar on heart disease without disclosing funding from the Sugar Research Foundation, a group backed by the sugar industry.
This unfortunate example highlights the essential role of objectivity in research. In scientific research, and especially in public health, findings can have life-altering implications for the health of millions. The need for transparency is obvious. Researchers must avoid conflicts of interest that could compromise the ethical integrity of not only their work, but also that of their institution.
We see evidence of the importance of academic integrity and transparency in the Honor Code for Harvard College, which states that members of the College community commit themselves to adhering to scholarly and intellectual standards. We expect no less from the School of Public Health and Harvard as a whole.
According to the World Health Organization, Philip Morris International has committed approximately $80 million annually to the Foundation for the next twelve years. It is clear that the tobacco industry and public health are fundamentally at odds, and regardless of the Foundation’s intentions, this financial connection undermines the Foundation’s objectivity as a potential sponsor of ethical scientific research.
We urge other schools at Harvard and beyond to follow similar steps that the School of Public Health has taken in vetting would-be donors. Conflicts of interest are not limited to public health studies, or even STEM fields, and ethical transgressions in the humanities and social sciences are no less serious.
Although some might argue that tightening research budgets in the past few years necessitate flexibility toward sources of funding, modern ethical guidelines remain unwavering. Researchers and institutions ought not compromise the integrity of their work even in a time of scarce funding.
We hope that the School of Public Health continues to live up to ethical standards and avoid conflicts of interest as a research organization ought to, and that other schools at Harvard follow their example.

“I will never, ever, hire/transfer you onto my team. Ever. I don’t care if you are a perfect fit or technically excellent or whatever. I will actively not work with you, even to the point where your team or product is impacted by this decision.”
So allegedly wrote one Adam Fletcher in 2015. Is Fletcher a white supremacist lurking amongst the halls of corporate America? A backwards homophobe creeping amongst the cubicles? A privileged misogynist sneering from above the glass ceiling? Maybe he is actually a hero for swinging an iron hammer upon a clearly toxic and dastardly employee!In actuality, Fletcher works for Google, and, first of all, should definitely know that nothing he says on the Internet is private. Fletcher's 2015 comment was recently linked to the 2017 publication of the so-called "anti-diversity manifesto" (which, in reality, proposed ways to increase the number of female tech wizards at Google) penned by one James Damore.
Damore’s only crime against Fletcher? Being conservative, white, and male. Damore has recently filed suit against Google for unfair discrimination in accordance with its hiring practices. Now, I’m no legal expert, but I do know that—within certain bounds—private companies are generally free to enact the hiring policies and quotas they want.
In California, though, there are broader protections for employees’ political opinions than what federal protections proffer. But I would posit that California did not exactly envision placing the shield of the state over beleaguered conservatives when it drafted those political ideology protections.
The visceral response to Damore’s memo is also not surprising in a world where “Campus Bias Teams”  have emerged at over 100 colleges and universities. Despite their name and expressed mission of supporting students and faculty who experience incidents of “bias and discrimination,” I hardly think these groups imagine themselves to be defenders of conservative campus minorities that are often on the receiving end of real bias.
But how the tables could turn! Imagine Damore wins his suit, or that conservative students and faculty could successfully initiate and win campus bias responses against discriminatory hiring and promoting practices, disinvited speakers, suppressions of academic expression, and more. The liberal machinery would be turned in upon itself, leveraged for the advancement of its opposition.But no self-respecting conservative would ever allow themselves to be considered an oppressed class in need of institutional protections. If they really did want to chalk up an imagined victory like the ones above, all they would have really done is leverage liberal tools and liberal frameworks to do so, and that would be no victory. The absolute last thing conservatives would ever want is special treatment, affirmative action, or legislation to tip the scales in their favor. So then, where do conservatives find their Ws? In many ways, conservatism can appear paradoxical. When it comes to government, less is more. When it comes to morality and virtue, we need as much as we can get. People should be permitted to act in their own self-interest, but law and order are necessary for fallen mankind.
Even given these intellectual puzzles, I believe that I accurately capture most of the large conservative ideological tent when I say that liberty, morality, virtue, and tradition are pillars of conservative thought. But while these pillars provide something akin to victory conditions, the path towards them is decidedly less clear.Sometimes I cannot help but wonder if a society governed by those noble forces is just as quixotic and as much a mirage as modern liberalism’s vision of equality and protection enforced by an all-benevolent state. Morality and virtues do not always course strongly through our society, and they are not easily developed or instilled in most people.
Legislative victories might bring some semblance of virtue or morality to the political system, but they would not increase those habits in individuals. Inducing or incentivizing people to behave virtuously is not the same thing as embracing virtue for its own sake. If Damore wins his suit, for example, that might make Google change its hiring practices, but it wouldn’t unharden the hearts of employees like Fletcher. Surely though, there are better and worse visions of utopia to strive for. We are fools to believe that existence is relative, even if morally complex. If there is no true good or true bad in this world, then existence is quite meaningless. It is not closed-minded or intolerant to remain steadfast and resolute on an intricate but significant issue; rather, it takes great intellect and courage to resist the temptation to waver and equivocate and instead stick to reasoned principle. When the world understands that there is objective right and wrong, then, I believe, conservatism can win.

Who is Harvard’s biggest rival? Yale, right? Nope, not anymore. Yes, The Game is still a big deal, but what’s true on the football field is no longer true for undergraduate education.
Yale, founded over 300 years ago, has been supplanted as the Crimson’s main competition in the academic world by an institution less than half as old—Stanford.
The numbers do not lie. In 2017 Stanford accepted 4.7% of 44,073 applicants for undergraduate admission. Harvard accepted 5.2% of 39,506. That makes the West Coast institution both more popular and more exclusive. Of the students who were accepted by both colleges, an estimated 43% pick Stanford over Harvard. That’s real competition (and a higher number than the estimated 39% who pick Yale over Harvard).
I’ve lived in Palo Alto, Stanford’s hometown, since I was a boy. Currently, though, I am hanging out in Cambridge as a resident scholar in Mather House. From what I’ve gleaned talking to applicants and students in both locales, Stanford’s the sexier choice. It’s smack-dab in the midst of Silicon Valley and has a climate without compare.
A friend of mine who teaches at Stanford calls it “a tech incubator with dorms.” He counted over 160 courses there with some variant of “entrepreneur” or “innovation” in their title. Its most celebrated grads are tech billionaires like Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal and early investor in Facebook, Reid Hoffman, founder of LinkedIn, and Reed Hastings, founder of Netflix. Stanford is to Silicon Valley what West Point is to the Army.
Harvard traditionally wanted to be the best at almost every academic discipline, from African-American studies to biology to Celtic. (The single exception was hard-core engineering, which was left to the MIT techies at the other end of Mass. Ave.) Graduates were not necessarily being trained for a specific profession. As former University President James B. Conant ’14 put it over seventy years ago in “General Education in a Free Society,” an imperative goal of Harvard was to prepare a graduate for “life as a responsible human being and citizen.”
Stanford’s recent ascendance in technology has not gone unanswered by our fair institution. Harvard is investing big-time in its School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Stanford-style incubation? Harvard has set up its Innovation Lab across the river to foster tech startups. Undergraduates are concentrating more than ever in fields like computer science, applied math, and economics.
Back during the Cold War, I served on the staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee. It’s said that during those days, as the Soviet KGB and American CIA played “Spy vs. Spy” around the world, the two agencies became more and more alike. Is that what Harvard is doing, becoming more like its chief competitor?
I hope not.
Of course, Harvard’s recent investments in STEM make sense in the world we live in, and I applaud them. But what makes Harvard special and gives it a competitive advantage of its own ought not be neglected. Harvard must shoot for more than training students for their future careers. It should remain a place that teaches undergraduates of all concentrations to think: to think critically, think clearly, think creatively, think empathetically. The responsible human beings and citizens whom Conant envisioned are needed in this nation and throughout the world more than ever. (A great place for some of them to focus would be in striking the balance between social good and technological progress.)
What does this mean for Harvard? That even while continuing to invest in STEM, it should reverse the slide in the study of literature, philosophy, foreign cultures, religion, history, and the humanities and social sciences generally. Today some humanities departments have more tenured faculty than concentrators.
The value of a Harvard degree should be measured in more than economic terms. As Robert F. Kennedy ’48 said, GNP “measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country. It measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.”
So, I offer this advice to Harvard’s next president. Let Stanford do what it may. Harvard should remain Harvard, a place where knowledge is valued primarily for its own sake, not for the new startups it spawns.

UPDATED: January 5, 2018 at 9:12 p.m.
Harvard plans to become fossil fuel-free by 2050, University President Drew G. Faust announced in an email sent to University affiliates Tuesday.
“Harvard will seek to become fossil fuel free by 2050 by meeting our energy needs with sustainable sources and by setting targets for purchasing externally-provided services that rely as little as possible on fossil fuels,” Faust wrote in the email.
Faust also detailed an interim goal: Harvard hopes to become fossil fuel-neutral by 2026. The University previously set a 10-year climate goal in 2006 and succeeded in 2016 in meeting its targets to reduce on-campus greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent while growing its square-footage by 12 percent.
As it seeks to become fossil fuel-free, the University will follow a new “Climate Action Plan,” formulated based on the recommendations of the Climate Change Task Force and sent as an attachment to Faust’s email. Faust established the task force in 2008 to study how to reduce the University’s greenhouse gas emissions.
Faust wrote that what she called the “ambitious climate goals” set by the University come in response to the threat climate change poses to humanity and the planet.
“We have continued to witness the detrimental effects of climate change here in the United States and around the world,” Faust wrote. “We have also seen an elevation of baseless skepticism of science—of the facts it generates and the value it produces—in our public discourse, and in research essential to human progress has come under assault.”
Faust also wrote that scientific research into the various implications of climate change drove the University’s dedication to fossil-fuel reduction. The action plan attached to her email included findings from Harvard School of Public Health researchers that asserted fossil fuel emissions can produce a variety of medical consequences in addition to environmental ones.
The plan also includes proposals for continued student and faculty research into climate issues using Harvard’s campus as a “living lab.” Since 2014, the University’s Climate Change Solutions Fund has contributed nearly $4 million to more than 30 climate research projects across a variety of disciplines, according to a press release attached to Faust’s email Tuesday.
In her letter, Faust wrote that one of the key steps toward implementing the Climate Action Plan involves appointing a new Sustainability Executive Committee. The committee will consist of faculty, administrators, and students tasked with reducing fossil fuel emissions.
The plan also charges Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp and Vice President for Campus Services Meredith L. Weenick with overseeing a “strategic planning process to reduce the University’s reliance on fossil fuels” in areas like transportation, district energy supply, and capital planning. The University will also convene working groups to form recommendations on the adoption of on-campus cost-effective energy-efficiency and emissions-reduction opportunities.
The University plans to work collaboratively with the cities of Boston and Cambridge to reach its climate goals. Both cities have set benchmarks for reaching carbon-neutrality by 2050. This collaboration will be particularly necessary to achieve the University’s goal of its district energy system operating without fossil fuels, Faust wrote.
Neither Faust’s email nor the action plan discussed the University’s stance on fossil fuel investments. Student activists have repeatedly called on the University to divest from fossil fuels over the past few years. Divest Harvard, a student activist group, blockaded University Hall in March to demand a “moratorium” on Harvard investments in the coal industry.
Divest Harvard did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday about Harvard’s new fossil fuel-free plan.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 7, 2018 at 2:42 p.m.
Datamatch, Harvard's popular student-created matchmaking algorithm, is spreading for the first time to Brown, Columbia, and Wellesley.
Since 1994, Datamatch—the Harvard Computer Society’s annual Valentine’s Day matchmaking survey— has set up thousands of dates between undergraduates at the College. Matches can go to eat free food at sponsors like Zinneken’s, El Jefe’s, BerryLine, and Flour Bakery.
Nearly 5,000 Harvard students registered for the program in 2017. With Datamatch’s expansion to three new colleges, more registrants are expected this year.
According to HCS Business Manager Russell F. Pekala ’19, Wellesley College student Madeleine A. Barowsky reached out to the Datamatch team asking to bring the program to her campus, while Datamatch reached out to students at Brown and Columbia universities.
Although Datamatch was created by HCS, co-Business Leaders Pekala and Sam L. Goldman ’19 said they mainly partnered with campus publications instead of technology-based clubs at other schools in order to develop survey questions catered to each campus.
“We wanted this to be a fun thing for our developers, who would work on a project that’s scaling up,’” Goldman said.
Each school’s edition will be unique, Pekala said.
“They each have a different sense of humor, obviously, and we struggled a little bit with deciding how much freedom to give them, in deciding what the questions would be and what the tone would be, how serious they would be, how many memes there would be in the questions, what kind of words could be used,” he said.
The staff of Columbia’s humor magazine, The Jester, was tasked with writing Columbia-specific Datamatch questions.
“I have been getting a lot of messages from people over the last few days asking if it’s up yet,”  said Supriya Ambwani, co-editor-in-chief of The Jester.
Barnard College is participating in Columbia's Datamach.
Wellesley has secured a partnership with local eatery Truly Yogurt and is working on developing other relationships with other nearby businesses. Neither Columbia nor Brown has sponsorships with local eateries like Harvard’s program to date, though some students say they hope this part of the program will be included in the future.
Brown sophomore Sarah E. Berman said she initially heard about the program through a Facebook post.
“I thought it was a hackathon or something and I clicked on it. It was not," she said. “Honestly, I think it’s kind of funny."
While Goldman said he was excited about Datamatch’s introduction to other campuses, he said he recognized that each school’s program might not receive as much of a turnout as Harvard’s version.
“This is very much a trial run for the expansion, so if we have 80 percent student participation here, presumably it’s not going to be anywhere close to that on the other campuses,” Goldman said. “But hopefully, it goes smoothly, we have a nice pipeline, we have other student groups that are interested. And then, in future years, we scale up.”
This article has been updated to reflect the following correction and clarification.
CORRECTION: February 7, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that Wellesley College had not secured any partnerships with local eateries for its version of Datamatch. In fact, Wellesley partnered with local eatery Truly Yogurt.
CLARIFICATION: February 7, 2018
A previous version of this article indicated that Russell F. Pekala ’19 and Sam L. Goldman ’19 are business managers for Datamatch. To clarify, they are the business leaders for the program.

The Advanced Standing program will undergo significant changes in 2020 to permit all College students to graduate with an undergraduate and master’s degree in four years.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted in favor of a motion updating the program at their monthly meeting  Tuesday. Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris first introduced a different version of the motion in December. On Tuesday, the Faculty voted to accept an amendment to the motion before accepting the motion itself.
The new guidelines will take effect starting in 2020 with the class of 2024. Under the new system, students will have the option of applying to the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences as an undergraduate in order to obtain a master’s degree during their four years at the College.
Previously, students had to have pre-existing Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate credit to apply for Advanced Standing. Undergraduates also had the option to forgo a fourth-year master’s degree and instead graduate in three years.
Though students will not be able to use AP or IB exams to receive credit from the College under the new program, individual departments will be able to use the exams for placement purposes. Students will still be able to use the exams to meet their two-semester language requirement.
At the Faculty meeting, several professors took issue with the elimination of the option to graduate in three years. Some argued there are numerous reasons students might want to pursue that path.
Computer Science Professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 said students who choose to graduate early often have a rationale that makes the decision “reasonable and worthwhile.”
“The students I know who’ve graduated in three or three and a half years don’t seem to be any less well educated than the rest, and each of them seems to have had some special, individual circumstance,” Lewis said.
Physics Professor Jennifer E. Hoffman ‘00, who noted she herself graduated in three years with advanced standing at Harvard, said she thinks personal issues like finances and health issues might motivate a student to graduate in three years.
Hoffman also gave examples of accomplished Harvard alumni who graduated under the Advanced Standing program, including current professors as well as University Provost Alan M. Garber ’77.
Lewis said he thinks the new guidelines will detrimentally affect Harvard’s ability to compete with peer institutions like Stanford and Yale in drawing students.
“All of those universities have acceleration programs. I’m sure they’d be delighted to see us end ours,” Lewis said. “Many consider it a kind of insurance when students are deciding to come here—they like knowing that if something bad happens to them or their families during their college years, they may be able to finish more quickly, and at lower cost.”
At Stanford, almost 20 percent of students participate in the “coterminal program,” their equivalent of Harvard's Advanced Standing initiative.
The Faculty also heard a presentation Tuesday from Dean of Social Sciences Claudine Gay about the University’s Inequality in America initiative, which seeks to bring together scholars from a variety of disciplines to study issues of inequality.
Gay said the initiative received over 330 applications for just two openings in their new two-year postdoctoral training program.

Harvard raised an all-time high $1.28 billion in fiscal year 2017,  surpassing fundraising totals from 2016 and topping Stanford’s fundraising total for a second consecutive year.
Fiscal Year 2017 marks the fourth consecutive year the University has raised over $1 billion, according to data from the Council for Aid to Education. Since the launch of the University’s historic capital campaign in 2013, Harvard has raised over $8 billion as of June 2017, far surpassing its initial goal of $6.5 billion.
In the past, Stanford University has traditionally topped Harvard’s fundraising totals, outpacing the University nine out of the past 12 years. In 2017, Stanford and Harvard were the only two schools to surpass the $1 billion mark.
Donations to American colleges totaled $43.6 billion in 2017, displacing the $41 billion total set in 2016. The top 20 highest-earning institutions—comprising less than 1 percent of the nation’s colleges— raised $12.23 billion, or roughly 28 percent of all donations. The list of 20 schools include five Ivy League schools: Columbia University, Yale University, the University of Pennsylvania, Cornell University, and Harvard.
A strong stock market contributed to higher personal giving, according to the Council for Aid to Education. Gifts from alumni of American colleges rose by 14.5 percent to $11.37 billion, accounting for 26.1 percent of total giving.
Harvard’s $37.1 billion endowment grew 8.1 percent in fiscal year 2017, meaning it grew the smallest amount compared to Ivy League peer endowments.

As Congress moves to reauthorize the Higher Education Act, University President Drew G. Faust raised concerns about the bill’s impact on federal financial aid at a Faculty meeting Tuesday evening.
The Higher Education Act, originally passed in 1965, authorizes the federal student financial aid program, and includes provisions for programs such as Pell Grants, the Federal Work Study Program, and loan repayment plans for undergraduate, graduate, and professional students.
Faust told Faculty members that the Act would reduce student aid and support for work study. 
Republican lawmakers’ proposed overhaul, called the PROSPER Act, would re-authorize Pell grants, restructure loan repayment plans, and eliminate Federal Work Study and public service loan forgiveness for graduate and professional students. The legislation passed a House committee in December but has yet to move to the full House or Senate for a vote.
Faust said that, while these provisions will likely be challenged in the Senate, the administration is trying to make sure they do not come to fruition.
The University is deploying its advocacy team in Harvard’s Federal Relations Office in Washington, D.C. to make the case for preserving student aid programs as they currently stand.
Like Faust, Suzanne Day, Harvard’s director of federal relations, raised similar concerns about the preliminary House bill in an emailed statement.
“In particular, we are concerned about the proposed changes to federal student aid programs and the potential negative impact on our students,” Day wrote.
Day also mentioned the elimination of subsidized student loans, grants for low-income students, and changes to federal financial assistance for graduate and professional students as priorities for the University.
“We are working, in coordination with our leading associations and others in higher education, to address these concerns with representatives in Congress,” Day wrote.
At the College, which touts its no-loan financial aid policy, students are less likely to be affected by changes to federal loan policies than at graduate and professional schools—though 16 percent of senior respondents to The Crimson’s Class of 2017 Senior Survey reported that they took out loans.
By comparison, it is commonplace for Harvard Law students to take out loans, and the Law School’s Class of 2016 graduated with an average loan burden of $153,172.
Under current law, graduate students enrolled in Public Service Loan Forgiveness eliminates debt for students who work up to 10 years in public service careers, such as law enforcement or public education. The new GOP bill would get rid of this program.
Kenneth H. Lafler, an assistant dean for student financial services at the Law School, said he thinks the changes to the Higher Education Act would have a relatively limited effect on Law School students, but would impact graduate students outside of Harvard. The Law School has its own loan repayment program, the Low Income Protection Plan, that is independent of federal loan forgiveness. Lafler said 681 graduates were enrolled in LIPP in last year.
“Most law schools around the country changed the way they provide loan assistance to integrate with the public service loan forgiveness program. So, the cancellation of that program would be a significant change for those schools, because they’re really dependent on that program,” Lafler said. “Our graduates are not and our program isn’t really tied into that.”
In the last year, Law School students and alumni have criticized LIPP, charging that it falls short of similar programs at peer institutions like Yale and Stanford, according to Nicole A. Summers. In Oct. 2017, Summers wrote and solicited signatures for an open letter to Law School Dean John F. Manning, asking the school to improve the program.
Lafler is more worried about a PROSPER Act provision that would nix Federal Work Study for graduate and professional students, affecting over 400 students at the Law School.
“We use federal work study to allow students to do public interest jobs in the summer. We have a program called summer public interest funding,” he said. “Work study is part of the way we fund that program. So, that would be a significant loss.”
Other experts on financial aid in higher education said certain provisions of the PROSPER Act would be detrimental to both graduate and undergraduate students.
Brian Taylor, managing director of Ivy Coach, a college admissions counseling company, said the overhaul of the Higher Education Act would raise costs for low- and middle-income college students and be especially difficult for graduate students.
“It’s going to significantly hurt middle- and lower-income students, which are exactly the kind of students that schools like Harvard are trying to attract,” Taylor said.

Charles Chen Yidan, co-founder of Tencent—a Chinese investment holding company—visited the Harvard Graduate School of Education this week for a conference showcasing the work of the 2017 recipients of his award for education innovators.
The award’s inaugural recipients, Stanford University professor Carol S. Dweck and Clara Victoria “Vicky” Colbert, director of the Colombia-based educational NGO Fundación Escuela Nueva, participated in a series of events with Education School students and faculty during the conference.
The Yidan Prize, founded in 2016, is a $3.9 million award given for contributions to education, with the intention of continuing the recipients’ work in their fields.
Chen, who left his post as the Chief Administrative Officer of Tencent in 2013 to be a full-time educational philanthropist, said education is the most important thing one can support.
“I have often said that education is the ultimate answer to social progress,” Chen said through a translator. “I think this is my lifetime career, especially after I stepped down from Tencent Group.”
Dweck, who was a professor at Harvard in the 1980s, said it was “wonderful” to return to the School of Education and to see former colleagues.
“At lunch with the dean yesterday, I remembered that this is where I developed those ideas,” Dweck said. “I had already done 15 years of research on the topic, but it was at Harvard where the ideas crystallized.”
Colbert, who created the “New School” model of education in Colombia, said she plans to use the Yidan Prize funds to expand the network of schools using her method. Designed for teachers in single-room schools in rural areas, the method is meant to address the needs of students with varying academic levels simultaneously.
Dweck said she plans to continue studying the impacts of her educational theories on student growth in American schools and developing a curriculum for teachers.
While visiting Harvard, Chen said he had the opportunity to meet with University President Drew G. Faust to discuss the Yidan Prize and Harvard’s own initiatives for transforming education.
“We had some detailed discussions about how the Yidan Prize went, and our ideas behind that,” Chen said. “She also shared with us some of the innovative projects and ideas Harvard will launch.”
Chen said that he and Faust had a “mutual understanding” on their goals for higher education.
“We both see education to be very future-oriented,” he said.

University President Drew G. Faust sent a letter to lawmakers on both sides of the aisle Friday, urging them to pass legislation protecting immigrants now vulnerable after the Trump administration’s termination of Temporary Protected Status.
The letter, addressed to House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, calls on Congress to protect individuals under Temporary Protected Status from not only El Salvador, but also Haiti, Nicaragua, and Sudan.
“I write today to urge you to take legislative action to protect these individuals—several dozen of them members of the Harvard community—from deportation,” Faust wrote.
Created by Congress in 1990 to offer provisional humanitarian relief, Temporary Protected Status is a designation granted by the Department of Homeland Security to certain foreign nationals who are unable to return to their country of citizenship due to unsafe circumstances, like an armed conflict or natural disaster. TPS recipients can legally live and work in the U.S. and are immune from deportation.
Over the last few months, the Trump administration has stripped TPS status from Sudanese, Haitians, and Nicaraguans. In January, the administration announced it would end TPS benefits for Salvadoran immigrants in Sept. 2019.
Faust’s letter comes after a group of 50 TPS-holding workers and their allies rallied outside Massachusetts Hall last week and delivered a petition calling on Faust to write to lawmakers on their behalf. They also asked her to hold a press conference on the issue before a Feb. 8 deadline for Congress to pass legislation funding the government. Immigration policy has become embroiled in those budget talks.
In her letter, Faust emphasized the positive contributions of TPS holders to Harvard and the country. She wrote that “repatriating them to countries that remain unstable or at risk” will only cause them harm.
“Today, more than 400,000 TPS recipients live, work, and invest in the United States.  As noted above, several dozen of these individuals work across multiple departments at Harvard and are highly valued and productive colleagues,” Faust wrote.
At a Faculty meeting Tuesday, Faust said she has been in contact with House and Senate leaders about TPS. She also said that she had the opportunity to speak to Senator Dick Durbin while he was at Harvard last week to seek his advice on the issue.
Harvard Kennedy School student Niharika N. Singh, a member of the International Scholars Working Group run by the graduate student unionization effort, spoke at the protest on Thursday. Singh said she was glad the University made a statement “after many months of organizing.”
“I think when DACA was repealed, that statement was made instantaneously whereas this has taken now quite a number of months since TPS status started being under risk and cancelled,” she said.
Other protesters also criticized Faust for a comparatively faster response to the Sept. 2017 repeal of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals—an Obama-era program that allowed undocumented youth to legally live and work in the United States. Faust denounced the decision to repeal DACA as “cruel” in a University-wide email just hours after the repeal.
Faust has been a long-time advocate for undocumented students and immigrants at Harvard and in higher education broadly. Since the repeal of DACA, Faust has advocated on behalf of undocumented students by signing letters, appearing on national television, and joining the “Dream Coalition,” an organization of business leaders and politicians pushing for legislation to protect undocumented students.
Last week, the University updated its “Undocumented at Harvard” website to include more information on TPS and the various ways in which affected members of the University can utilize resources on campus. The Harvard Immigration and Refugee Law Clinic currently has one full-time attorney devoted to providing legal counsel on immigration issues.

Michelin star chef and humanitarian José Andrés discussed  the importance of providing aid to Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria at an Institute of Politics panel Tuesday.
Andrés joined the former Secretary of Homeland Security, the Vice President of Disaster Operations and Logistics for the Red Cross, and the Director of Emergency Management for Walmart to discuss national responses to natural disasters in 2017 at the panel.
In 2010, Andrés founded the nonprofit World Central Kitchen to build restaurants, bakeries, and schools in Haiti following the Jan. 2010 earthquake.
After Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico last September, Andrés said he flew to the island to build a network of 18 restaurants and provide more than 2 million meals throughout the approximately four months his team was there. His organization fed more people in Puerto Rico than the Red Cross, Salvation Army, or any government agency, according to the New York Times.
“You got the sense that there was no centralized leadership,” Andrés said in an interview after the panel. “I would say that. Not that I like centralized leadership.”
With the help of over 10,000 volunteers, Andrés said he tackled a disaster “of biblical proportions.”
Andrés said he and his team fed hospitals, the National Guard, and even the most remote areas of the island. He and his team prepared six different menus everyday with items including traditional Puerto Rican meals like pastelón de carne—a type of meatloaf—and sancocho—a beef stew—as well as sandwiches and fruit.
“We became the biggest buyer of fruit on the island for a couple of months,” Andrés said. “We were getting loads of apples, of oranges; we always tried to deliver one or two pieces of fruit with every meal.”
Andrés said he and his team would often go to extreme lengths to provide food to all parts of the island.
“I was crossing a river with a tray of chicken because the bridge went down in the water and it was no easy river to cross, and I fell back and the chickens survived,” Andrés said.  “I was proud of that. I mean, a chef cannot lose his food, but I don’t want to brag about it.”
“I lost two satellite phones but I saved the chickens,” he added.
Andrés and the panelists also emphasized the improvements that still need to be made to the national response to the disaster in Puerto Rico.
Jeh Johnson, the former secretary of Homeland Security under President Barack Obama, said Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico at an inopportune time on the heels of disasters like Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas late last August. Still, he said the island should not have been overlooked.
“It’s an island; it’s not an excuse,” Johnson said.
Andrés said he worried there was a lack of adequate thought given by government agencies to an environment where people are in desperate need of food. For instance, he said that in one case, Puerto Ricans were sent rice and beans without any method of cooking them.
“Someone is not thinking about those details that mean the difference between life and death,” Andrés said. “A guy at the FBI doesn’t know where the shop is, but the cook does.”
Andrés encouraged people to travel to the island as a way to help restart the Puerto Rican economy.
“Show up on vacation because the industry needs to come back and there is enough infrastructure to have a good time,” he said. “Even if it’s one dollar, donate to the search and donate to the small NGOs that you feel are doing a good job on the island.”

Following Harvard’s $50 million pledge to West Station, many affiliates praised the University’s commitment to improving transportation services in Allston.
Last month, Harvard promised $50 million to fund West Station, a commuter rail stop on the Framingham-Worcester line, and up to $8 million to help construct another, interim transportation station in Allston. This pledge marks a significant increase from the University’s previous commitment of one third of the estimated development costs.
In Oct. 2014, when Harvard made the initial pledge, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority announced plans to construct a new commuter rail station—West Station—to connect Allston to downtown Boston and the greater Boston area. The MBTA planned to build the station on Harvard-owned land near Beacon Park Yard.
Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard’s increased pledge follows a series of other actions by the University to promote the Interstate-90 Allston Interchange Improvement Project, which will include the removal of the Houghton rail spur to realign Soldier’s Field Road.
“Harvard has viewed West Station as a critical and essential element to the Interchange project,” Lapp wrote. “It is our hope that these commitments might alleviate some of the financial concerns associated with the project.”
Monica Tibbits-Nutt, a freshman proctor who sits on the fiscal and management control board of the MBTA, said the increased pledge was “unprecedented and unusual.” She said that Harvard’s actions marked a turning point in the relationship between the state’s transportation system and the university.
“It’s a really wonderful step in the right direction, especially with the partnerships between the MBTA and our other local universities,” she said.
Rosabeth M. Kanter, a professor at the Harvard Business School, said the pledge is “forward-thinking” and “visionary.” She said she believes that the investment will help alleviate traffic congestion, reduce carbon emissions, and spur economic development.
“Public transit investments generally bring in a multiplier of three or four to one in new economic activity,” she wrote in an email statement.
While many praised Harvard’s increased pledge, the University is not the only potential funder of West Station.
José A. Gómez-Ibáñez,a professor of urban planning and public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, called upon Boston University to contribute funds to West Station as well.
“If your notion of fairness was that the biggest beneficiaries ought to pay, then some combination of a big contribution from Harvard, a significant contribution from BU, and a surcharge on property taxes and value on the station would be a fair way to go,” he said.
Boston University had initially promised to fund one-third of the costs, but it did not finalize its pledge. At the time, BU was concerned about how the new station’s North-South connections would affect the University’s campus.
In response to Harvard’s increased commitment, BU spokesperson Colin Riley said that the university will continue to support the construction of West Station.
“We look forward to both discussing these new developments with the community, the state, the city, and Harvard, and determining how BU can help,” Riley wrote.
Riley did not respond when asked for comment regarding criticisms of BU not pledging funds.
Regardless of funding distribution, Gómez-Ibáñez stressed the importance of constructing a station soon. In particular, he said he was concerned that the interim station may become semi-permanent or permanent.
“In that case, I think it would be the best case for everyone to build the station soon and not wait for some state aid that may be a long time in coming,” he said.

The Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response will restructure its staffing in the coming weeks as the office continues to face leadership vacancies nine months after its director left Harvard.
Alicia Oeser stepped down as the director of OSAPR, a University-wide resource for crisis counseling, medical advocacy, and education services to combat issues of sexual assault, in May 2017 and her associate director, Meera Seshadri, resigned only a few months later in October.
Since this time, only three staff members—out of a total six positions—have been working for OSAPR. In this time, Harvard’s Office of Dispute Resolution also reported a rapid increase of 65 percent in formal complaints of sexual harassment for the 2016–2017 academic year amidst a national movement.
Maria Francesconi, director of Nursing and Health Education in Harvard University Health Services, wrote in an emailed statement that OSAPR will create the new role of “case coordinator” to replace the associate director position after recent student feedback requested an increase in “direct care services.”
Francesconi wrote that OSAPR has hired a licensed mental health clinician for the new position and the individual is expected to start within a few weeks. She added that student members of the campus peer education and peer counseling groups, Consent Advocacy and Relationship Education as well as Response, were involved in the hiring process.
“This role, staffed by a licensed mental health clinician, is designed to be someone who can provide support services to those who have experienced any level of interpersonal violence and can also assist in connecting our community members to other resources both inside and outside the Harvard community,” Francesconi wrote.
Francesconi also wrote that the hiring of the new case coordinator has delayed the appointment of a permanent director for OSAPR.
“We prioritized this search over the director role, given its importance to our direct care services, and are now in the early interviewing process for a director,” Francesconi wrote. “This process will include feedback from students, faculty, and staff, and we hope to have it filled later this semester.”
First established in 2003, OSAPR originally only provided services to College students, but by 2013, the office had expanded to be a University-wide resource for students, faculty, and staff.
In 2014, amid campus controversy over Harvard’s handling of sexual assault, University President Drew G. Faust pledged to increase funding for OSAPR leading to a more than doubling of the office’s staff size in less than a year.
In a 2014 letter to Faust, former University Provost Steven E. Hyman wrote that members of a presidential task force on sexual assault were concerned about OSAPR’s ability to adequately serve students with its previous levels of funding and staffing.
“We are concerned that moving forward, an understaffed OSAPR risks slow or ineffective responses to students who have experienced sexual assault,” Hyman wrote in the letter. “The task force asks that OSAPR be provided with whatever additional resources are necessary to carry out its role—beginning as soon as possible.”
Francesconi wrote that she hopes the position will be filled “later this semester.”
OSAPR staff members did not respond to requests for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students, professors, and legal experts discussed the direction the nation should take following the national spotlight on the #MeToo movement at a Tuesday evening panel.
About 50 students gathered in Emerson Hall for the event, which was co-sponsored by the Harvard College Democrats, Our Harvard Can Do Better, and the ReproJustice Action and Dialogue Collective.
Panelists included Law School Professor Diane Rosenfeld, Massachusetts Legislative Aide Preyel Patel, University of Massachusetts-Boston Professor J. Shoshanna Ehrlich, and Know Your IX Policy and Advocacy Coordinator Sejal Singh.
The panelists discussed the evolution of the movement against sexual assault over time. Ehrlich observed that over the decades, a new vocabulary had to be created in order for people to be capable of discussing the experience of sexual harassment.
“When I was a teenager, sexual harassment really hadn’t been invented as a formal legal concept,” Ehrlich said. “I had no words for it. I had no name for it.”
A central theme in the panelists’ responses was the call for intersectionality within the movement, and advocacy for marginalized groups.
“I can’t speak for a trans woman, but I can hold a space for her,” Rosenfeld said.
Panelists also called for individuals to not shy away from difficult conversations with their peers.
“I personally have had several conversations with male friends and female friends about, for example, the Aziz Ansari article,” Patel said. “That one especially was very controversial, because I think a lot of people—a lot of men especially—saw themselves in his shoes.”
But it is this kind of conversation, Patel said, that helps drive progress.
RAD President Sarah M. Lipson ’20 said she hoped students would learn that the #MeToo movement is more than just stories of sexual assault.
“Every single person has something to contribute and they will be affected, even if by extension,” Lipson said.
Many students said they strongly connected to the topics discussed by the panelists.
“I thought that it was really interesting how they really focused on power dynamics, talking a lot about the patriarchy and how this is a really systemic problem,” Jeremy A. Stepansky ’21 said.
“What really struck me about this entire discussion was the framing of what’s happening right now with the #MeToo movement as something that is part of a longer-term feminist project that’s been going on for decades, and also as something that has real revolutionary power to create change,” Amelia Y. Goldberg ’19, an organizer for Our Harvard Can Do Better, said.
“That gave me a lot of hope. I hope people got the sense that this is a fight we’re in, but it’s a fight we can win,” she added.
Sruthi Palaniappan ’20, the College Democrats’ service director, said she believes it's important to be patient. 
"Culture doesn’t change overnight,” Sruthi Palaniappan ’20, the College Democrats’ service director, said. “But it’s important that we are making constant efforts to create these large strides.”

Mila Kunis phoned at least one member of the Hasty Pudding Institute’s graduate board to discuss adding women to the group's historically all-male cast hours before the Pudding announced its decision to go co-ed, according to two individuals with knowledge of the proceedings.
Kunis—in town to accept the Hasty Pudding Theatricals 2018 Woman of the Year award—made the phone call while dining with various Pudding company members at Harvard Square restaurant Parsnip on Jan. 25, according to the two individuals. The actress implied she would apply pressure in some way during the call to push the graduate board to accept women, the two individuals said.
Kunis said at the lunch she strongly favored the Pudding announcing its decision to admit women as cast members that day, according to the two individuals, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity.
Hours after the meal in Harvard Square, Pudding undergraduate president Amira T. Weeks ’18 mounted the stage in Farkas Hall—the Pudding’s longtime campus digs—and declared the group would open its cast to women starting in fall 2018, breaking with almost 200 years of precedent. Weeks read aloud a letter from former Pudding President Andrew L. Farkas ’82 disclosing the policy shift.
Farkas wrote in his letter that the Pudding had decided to go co-ed “some time ago” and chose to keep the decision “absolutely silent” until the Woman of the Year celebrations. But up until the lunch in Parsnip, almost no members of the company knew or thought the co-ed policy would be debuted during the festivities Jan. 25, according to the two individuals.
Representatives for Kunis did not respond to repeated requests for comment. In an emailed statement, Farkas pointed to the letter Weeks read onstage.
“My letter speaks for itself and is factual in the extreme,” Farkas wrote. “Anything to the contrary would be an inaccurate statement of fact.”
Weeks directed a request for comment to the Pudding’s graduate board.
Kunis sat down for lunch at Parsnip, a white-walled farm-to-table restaurant located across an alleyway from the Pudding’s social clubhouse, with undergraduate members as well as adults employed by the theatrical group.
Soon after arriving, the actress—who dined on winter chicory salad, farm-roasted chicken, and a brownie sundae while sipping a glass of Chardonnay, according to Parsnip staff—started asking her lunchmates how they felt about accepting women as cast members, the two individuals said. Since its inception in 1844, the Pudding has retained an all-male cast of performers, though women have long held positions on other boards like business and technology.
The vast majority of those surveyed at the table said they wanted to see women on cast, the two individuals said. Kunis stopped asking when she got halfway around the table, according to the individuals.
Instead, she asked the group why the decision to go co-ed had not yet been made and publicly announced. She also asked who had final say over the Pudding’s gender policies, the two individuals said.
After attendees pointed to the graduate board, Kunis stepped out of earshot of those sitting at the table and phoned at least one member of the board, according to the two individuals. It is unclear exactly what Kunis said on the call.
Later that day—after she had been hailed as the Woman of the Year and after Weeks made the official co-ed announcement—Kunis said at a press conference she would not have attended the festivities had the Pudding not debuted its new policy.
“I wouldn’t be here otherwise,” she said.
Kunis also told reporters she had advance notice of the move.
“I knew that this was going to happen, a version of this, and maybe this was something they’ve been talking about for a long time,” she said. “I don’t want that to be taken away from the students, the infrastructure. They’ve been fighting for this, and they have wanted this, and they’re the reason this happened.”
Women on campus first began auditioning to join the Pudding’s all-male cast in 2015, with no success then or in the years since. In Sept. 2016, at least 86 Pudding alumni signed a petition urging the group to end its all-male casting practices.
Following the Pudding’s announcement of its new casting policy, undergraduate women across campus vowed to audition for the cast next year. Some said they appreciated what they called Kunis’s support for the Pudding’s co-ed move.
In the days leading up to the Woman of the Year celebrations, Kunis garnered negative attention from at least one national media outlet calling on her to turn down the Pudding’s award given her past advocacy for women’s rights.
Kunis responded to this criticism at the press conference Jan. 25.
“If you’re going to ask someone to not show up, it’s a pretty weak stance to take,” Kunis said. “The smarter thing [to] ask me of would’ve been to take a stance. Backing down is not taking a stance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An hour before tip-off in Ithaca, N.Y., on Feb. 3., the Harvard men’s basketball team collectively jogged onto the court for the first time. Only a scattering of media and fans was present inside Bartels Hall—Cornell’s multi-sport athletic complex—at that hour, and many were heading towards Lynah Rink, where the nation’s No.1 men’s hockey team was warming up for a duel against its cross-state rival, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
Meanwhile inside a quiet Newman Arena, two voices particularly stood out on the basketball court. One came from head conditioning coach Luke Osberg, who was guiding the Crimson in pregame stretches as they moved parallel from one side of the court to the other.
The source of the other voice: junior forward Corey Johnson, who was noticeably stretching a few steps ahead of the rest of the team. The defeat less than 24 hours ago against Columbia did not seem to affect the energetic three-point specialist, who throughout pregame was exchanging a mix of light-hearted banter and short pump-up messages with a team that, according to head coach Tommy Amaker, was still quite “gassed and tired” from the previous night’s contest.
As the only upperclassmen in Amaker’s rotation with consistent minutes, Johnson has taken over as Harvard’s on-court vocal leader this season. This post in the past was held almost exclusively by Siyani Chambers ’16-’17 and Zena Edosomwan ’17 , whose graduations last year left questions as to who would become the new guiding leader(s) on Amaker’s roster.
The 11th-year Crimson head coach made clear over the summer that senior Chris Egi, a native of Markham, Ontario, had earned his right to be the team’s official captain for the 2017-2018 season.
Egi has been an important mentor to the young Harvard team throughout the season, despite only seeing action in two games. Particularly enthusiastic on the sidelines, the team’s captain has contributed in many ways towards infusing positive energy onto the Crimson.
“My senior class was the last class to win an Ivy League Championship,” Egi said. “I think that kind of gives us some credibility in speaking to the younger guys. We’ve seen what it takes to get there, obviously you have to work hard and they want it. But as a class, not just individuals, we have to step up and just bring that foundation in terms of being vocal leaders.”
On the court, however, Johnson has been the clear headman. During quick breaks in the action, the Ottawa native can often be seen yelling at teammates to gather and huddle. During these team meetings lasting no more than ten seconds, the junior uses this time to settle the team down and offer encouraging statements. Johnson is also extremely outspoken during timeouts, frequently being the last voice before the team returns onto the court.
“I have always found myself as a vocal player on the court and basically I am just trying to do my best to keep everybody together on the floor when we get into moments when we need to recalibrate and regroup,” Johnson said. “I want to make sure everyone is on the same page and we get onto the next play no matter what is going on. If things are going well, if things are going bad, we are always just thinking about the next play and how we are going to win the game.”
The presence of a stabilizing force like Johnson has been critical for a young team that is still struggling through inconsistency and long offensive barren stretches this season.
Against Dartmouth on Jan. 20, Harvard was up by as much as 17 points in the second half before going blank in the next six minutes, ultimately requiring an offensive revival in overtime. A similar pattern occurred in the Yale contest six days later, which saw the Crimson jump out to a 20-5 lead only to allow the Bulldogs to bring it within four by halftime. Made free throws down the stretch were crucial in that victory.
“Even though teams have made late runs on us, we have been able to maintain our composure and consistency on both ends and figure out a way really to grind out a few really good road wins,” Johnson said. “Hopefully we can continue to do that.”
The junior wing has also had to battle against his own shooting woes, particularly early in the season. In a stretch of five games between Nov. 30 and Dec. 23, Johnson shot a combined 6-of-22 from three point range, averaging 4.0 points per game.
Despite this extended shooting slump, Amaker gave his three-point specialist more than 30 minutes of playing time in each of the next three games. Moreover, Johnson was still given the green light to shoot, achieving greater accuracy with nine made triples in 21 attempts.
Amaker’s continued trust and confidence in one of his main perimeter weapons has paid off in recent conference games. Johnson has shot over 40 percent from deep in his past four games, including five made triples against Columbia. Before that Lions game, Amaker attributed making easier shots on helping the shooter regain his touch.
“It’s amazing how shooters and scorers, if they get a free throw or a layup, it changes things,” Amaker said. “Right after that [Corey] made some deep, long shots. I think getting off of the ledger relaxed him and gave him confidence. The next thing you know, he is making shots.”
For Johnson, continued improvement offensively will be critical in balancing out a talented Crimson roster as the team approaches the end of the season. Currently in second place in the Ancient Eight behind the unbeaten Penn Quakers, Harvard will depend on Johnson’s aggressive perimeter shooting to open space for its sophomores and freshmen to attack the rim and create playmaking opportunities.
The junior wing has largely embraced this vocal but complementary role on the team, crediting the importance of ball distribution and communication on both sides of the court for the team’s recent success.
“We have so many offensive weapons that any given night any one of us can pick up the offensive load,” Johnson said. “We are always willing to find that hot hand. We are very unselfish… It is basically finding who is on for that night and hopefully willing to run our offensive through that.”
This type of team-first, collective mentality has become not only an important motto for Coach Amaker, but a message that his team leaders have embraced. In many ways, Johnson’s words echoes the type of openness and trust that Amaker has sought from all members of his program. To lead, as Johnson has demonstrated, involves a balance between gaining a voice and holding others accountable.
“When you see something, say something,” Amaker said. “That is where we are. Embrace that, trust that, and don’t fight it—that’s the way in which we are trying to coach them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard (9-13-2, 7-9-2 ECAC) came up just short of a miraculous comeback against Boston University (11-14-6, 6-11-5 Hockey East) in the 2018 Beanpot semifinal on Tuesday evening, falling by a score of 3-2.
Crimson hockey fans know that this matchup can get wild, with the last meeting between the two ending in a 6-6 tie following overtime. Tonight proved to be no different. Harvard found itself down 3-0 within six minutes of the initial puck drop, following a pair of goals from senior Victoria Bach and one from freshman Jesse Compher. This was a somewhat surprising result considering the two schools’ records as well as their respective histories against one another. The Terriers had beaten the Crimson in the Beanpot tournament just twice in the tournament’s 40-year history before its win last night.
Falling behind early did not deter Harvard though, as it found itself very much in the game in the first period and throughout the rest of the contest. After settling down, the Crimson seemed to outplay Boston University for long stretches, at times looking like it was the one leading by a score of 3-0.
“I think it was out of pure frustration honestly that we turned it around.” said sophomore forward Kat Hughes. “Obviously you never want to get down early on, especially not by three goals, but right when that third goal went in, it kind of flipped a switch, and we started playing really hard.”
Harvard broke through with five minutes remaining in the first period, when freshman forward Brooke Jovanovich found the net following a save from Terriers keeper Corinne Schroeder. From that goal until the end of the first period, the Crimson looked hungry for more, testing the Boston University keeper on multiple occasions, and looking as if it would pull within touching distance before the start of the second frame.
The Terriers had their chances as well, and goalie Beth Larcom came up big for Harvard many times throughout the extremely lively, back and forth affair. Things got even more interesting when the Crimson went up a player early on in the second period. After some sustained pressure on the Boston University defense, senior defender Chelsea Ziadie struck a thunderbolt from just outside of the neutral zone, finding its way through plenty of traffic, one pair of Harvard legs, and into the net to bring the Crimson within just one goal of its crosstown rival.
With a spot in the Beanpot final on the line and Harvard trailing by just a single goal, the Terriers managed to pick up the intensity, and began to match the Crimson's pace. Larcom stayed vigilant, finishing the night with 29 saves, compared to 24 from Boston University’s Schroeder.
The night finished in disappointment for Harvard, as it was not able to finish off what would have surely been a memorable comeback in Chestnut Hill. With the final seconds ticking away, the Crimson pulled its goalie in hopes of finding that decisive third goal, but that continued to be elusive. In a six versus five situation and with pressure mounting, Schroeder sprawled and saved a shot which made its way across the length of goal line, somehow keeping the Terriers ahead. With Harvard’s net open, Boston University almost took advantage of its opportunity to seal the game, with a shot from senior forward Victoria Bach just missing the empty net as time expired. Had this gone in, it would’ve marked a hat trick for Bach.
Harvard has struggled to bounce back from opponents' goals recently, conceding three in rapid succession late in the game on Saturday versus No. 4 Colgate after firmly holding the Raiders at 1-0 for almost 40 minutes. The same problem troubled the team last night, with the Terriers' three goals coming within just 2:21 of one another, and within just over six minutes of the game’s start. Following this lapse, Harvard was strong on defense, shutting its opponents out for the remaining 55 or so minutes of the game.
Jovanovich continues to leave her mark on this team and this season, with the Ontario native’s goal earning her a fourth point in her last four games. Contributions from fellow freshmen Buckles, Gilmore, Sorkin and others have been big this season, and they show that the Crimson can be optimistic looking toward the future.
“This year was the 40th annual Beanpot, and for the history of women’s hockey, it’s a big deal.” said junior captain forward Kate Hallett. “It’s exciting to be able to be a part of an unbelievable tradition, but beyond that, something which Coach Stone always says is that it’s an opportunity to play for a trophy in February. That’s always really exciting.”
The loss means that Harvard will have to look on from the sidelines next Tuesday at Conte Forum during the Beanpot Championship, in which Boston University will play Boston College at 8 p.m. The Crimson and Northeastern will vie for third place in the consolation game at 4:30 on the same day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an all-important weekend, Harvard women’s basketball will travel to Princeton, N.J., and Philadelphia, Penn., to take on the only other two teams in the Ivy League with just a single loss in a two-day battle for the top of the conference.
The Crimson (13-6, 5-1 Ivy League) is coming off an impressive home winning streak of six straight games. Harvard has yet to lose in Lavietes Pavilion, posting a perfect 10-0 record at home this season. The team’s away record of 1-5, however tells a different story.
Nevertheless, Harvard will hit the road this weekend looking to take down Princeton (14-4, 4-1) and Penn (13-5, 4-1) for control of the conference.
“The home stretch has been great. It’s really built our confidence,” senior co-captain Kirby Porter said. “One of things we’ve been emphasizing this week is that we don’t care where we’re playing, our mentality home and away should be the same by taking that energy from home and replicating it.”
The Crimson hopes to flip the script against the two squads. The Tigers have swept Harvard in conference play for three straight years, with the Crimson’s last win over Princeton coming in January 2014. The Quakers have also swept Harvard three years in a row, and the Crimson has not won in Philadelphia in nearly six years, as its last successful trip to Penn came in February 2012.
This is not to say both rivalries have been completely one-sided, however. Harvard has taken the Tigers to overtime in each of the last two seasons, and the margin of victory between the two teams has not eclipsed 10 points since 2015.
The Quakers, on the other hand, have seen an average margin of victory against the Crimson of 19 points in the last four matchups between the two teams. Decisive victories have become the norm for Penn, as it boasts a whopping plus-12.6 scoring margin on the year.
While there is something to be said for history, Harvard doesn’t seem to care.
“One of the strengths of this team is we don’t care who [we’re] playing,” Porter said. “We have this mentality that we’re going to keep doing what we’re doing.”
It is not easy to ignore the major implications of this weekend for all three squads. Each team sits atop the Ancient Eight with only one conference loss. Harvard is currently in first place by half a game, trailed closely by Princeton and Penn. The team that comes out of the weekend with the best record will be in the driver’s seat for the second half of the conference season, as the Tigers and Quakers both also host Dartmouth (12-7, 4-2). The Big Green are nipping at the heels of the three leaders in a close fourth place.
Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith’s group enters Friday’s contest at Princeton in peak form. The Crimson’s explosive offense has scored over 80 points in four straight games. Over the course of its dominant homestand, Harvard has averaged 82.5 points per game thanks to double-digit performances from six different players.
“I think that says so much about our team,” Porter said. “It’s been our identity all year, we don’t care who’s scoring, and on any given night anyone can be the top scorer or performer.”
In the team’s victory over Cornell, every single player saw the court—a further statement of the group mentality central to the Crimson’s success. The contributors included freshman forward Jadyn Bush, who recorded her first career double-double that night. Bush saw extended playing time due to injuries causing sophomore forward Jeannie Boehm and junior guard Sydney Skinner to leave the game. Despite the thin bench, Harvard’s offense did not slow down.
“Our team is pretty deep and no matter who’s in the game,” senior guard Taylor Rooks said. “We always show the same amount of intensity from the start of the jump to the end of the game.”
Harvard’s electric offense will encounter resistance this weekend in the form of the top two defenses in the Ivy League. Princeton allows the fewest points per game at 56.3, while Penn follows closely behind at 56.9. No other team in the conference allows fewer than 61 on an average night.
“This weekend might be slower,” said Porter, referencing the defense-minded style of both upcoming opponents. “The key for us is staying on the same page on offense, not rushing our shots, and being confident in our shot selection.”
Throughout the 2017-2018 campaign, the Crimson has been showcasing its offense talent, averaging 70.5 points per game this season. The versatile offense will face its toughest challenge yet in the stout defenses.
“It comes down to us playing our game and staying composed by playing within ourselves,” Rooks said.
Whether defense or offense prevails, Harvard will be looking to reverse the trends of the past in order to take control of first place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A weekend of heavyweights.
Harvard men’s basketball returns home to Lavietes Pavilion this weekend, clashing with Princeton on Friday night followed by Penn on Saturday afternoon. In its month-long stretch of games away from Cambridge, the Crimson (10-11, 5-1 Ivy League) gritted its way to late-game wins against Yale, Dartmouth, and Cornell. Only against Columbia was Harvard unable to fight back after squandering a halftime lead.
Coach Tommy Amaker’s squad currently holds the second spot in the Ancient Eight after the first month of conference play. The group trails neither the Bulldogs nor the Tigers—preseason Ivy favorites—but rather the Quakers (16-11, 6-0), who have largely dominated their conference opponents up to this point. Penn was winless after the first six Ivy games last season, pointing at a complete program reversal for third-year coach Steve Donahue.
Furthermore, the Quakers will come into this weekend as confident as ever, having just blown out Princeton (11-10, 3-3) on Tuesday night, 82-65. In that contest, five Quakers finished in double-digits on 53.6 percent shooting from the field. Senior guard Darnell Foreman was the lead man with 21 points and 5 takeaways, while Tigers junior guard Devin Cannady—Princeton’s offensive focal point—was held under 10 points for the first time since Dec. 23.
With the loss, the Tigers now sit in a three-way tie for third place on the Ancient Eight leaderboard alongside Brown and Columbia.
“I wish we are in a slightly different place than where we are in the standings, but I think you are what your record says that you are,” Princeton coach Mitch Henderson said. “So we got a lot of work to do, and I just ask the guys to tune out all the different stuff they are thinking about and zero in on each other.”
For Amaker and the Crimson, both games will be likely must-wins if Harvard intends on competing for the No. 1 seed heading into the Ivy League Tournament. The Crimson was outdueled by both teams in last season’s final Princeton-Penn weekend, albeit after securing the No. 2 spot in the postseason tournament.
This year, Harvard is the favorite against the Tigers but stands in a rare predicament as the underdog against the Quakers on Saturday.
“We’ve consistently talked about, through the years...about how important and how we think that the league is eventually won on Saturday nights,” Amaker said. “No matter what happens on Friday.”
Complicating the weekend for the Crimson is the possibility it will again be without sophomore point guard Bryce Aiken, who re-injured his left knee in the final minutes of last Friday’s Columbia defeat. The Randolph, N.J., native had just logged his second straight game with more than 18 minutes of action for the first time since early December. Spectating in jogging clothes against Cornell, Aiken’s outlook is doubtful-at-best for this weekend.
Sophomore guard Christian Juzang has averaged 11 points per game in the three conference games Aiken has missed, particularly earning praise from Amaker for his defensive play.
“We’ve been a very good defensive team as of late,” Amaker said. “[Juzang]’s been one of the key cogs when it comes to that so I’m really, really pleased with how he’s helped our team in areas that may not necessarily go on the stat sheet or headlines.”
Against Princeton, Harvard’s improved defense will be put to the test against the three-headed threat of Cannady, junior guard Myles Stephens, and senior guard Amir Bell. All three guards enter the weekend with double-digit scoring averages, including 27- and 23-point performances from Cannady and Stephens, respectively, in last Saturday’s loss to Brown. Bell has elevated several non-scoring facets of the game, doubling his totals last year in both assists per game (3.9) and rebounds per game (5.4).
“Tough stretch but we have Miles, Amir, Devin, who have been through some really big games on the road,” Henderson said. “Sometimes when you go on the road things come together a little bit more, your focus tends to get a little more laser-like. I’m hopeful that will be true for us.”
The following evening against Penn, Harvard sophomore Chris Lewis will need to maintain his defensive composure against sophomore forward AJ Brodeur, who has a particular knack for maneuvering his body around the rim to create scoring opportunities. Lewis was mired in foul trouble in the Jan. 27 game against Brown, limiting himself to just 15 minutes of play.
The aforementioned Foreman and the team’s leading scorer, sophomore guard Ryan Betley, are also extremely aggressive in challenging opponents at the rim. Betley has gotten to the foul line seven times in the past three games, while Foreman has reached the charity stripe eight times in that same span. The Crimson, nevertheless, has readied itself for various situations when foul trouble may be an issue.
“We actually practice at times in those situations when a certain person has fouled out or a certain has four fouls, so they can hopefully get in the mindset of how to play in those moments,” Amaker said. “And that’s hopefully one of the reasons we talk always so much about our bench and our balance, that we can overcome it.”
Evidently, Harvard will head into this weekend well-prepared for what is to be an exciting docket of home games. As the final two Ivy teams that Harvard has yet to face, Princeton and Penn will shed some light on the Crimson’s current postseason prospects.

Yes, you should be trying to make your S.O.'s day every day, but February 14th is the one day you definitely can’t afford to mess up. As Valentine’s Day creeps up and #couplegoals rises up the Trending list, the pressure to plan the best date is on. No idea how to spend the day with your significant other? Sick of settling for El Jefe’s outings? We've got your back with these potential date ideas for you and your boo.
Ice Skating
Take advantage of the snowy, picturesque weather and head to Frog Pond for ice skating. A much needed break from campus, ice skating is one of the few reasons below freezing temperatures can actually be a good thing. If neither of you know how to ice skate, then this idea is a must. Nothing says "happy couple" like falling on your butts together.
Bougie Meals
Use Valentine’s Day as an excuse to escape unseasoned dining hall food and treat yourselves. Consider venturing out into new options, or splurge on the lavish restaurants that you always walked past with a pang in your heart and your wallet. Some particularly romantic enclaves in the Square include Beat Brassiere, Temple Bar, and Grafton Street.
Explore Boston
Be honest with yourself: When’s the last time you left the vicinity of campus and actually gone into the city? Extracurricular obligations don’t count. This is the perfect opportunity for you and your partner to explore new sights together, whether it’s strolling down Newbury Street, chasing squirrels in Boston Common, or wandering through the bustling streets of Chinatown.
Domestic Dates
For 364 days of the year, Harvard may seem like a bleak prison chaining our souls until the death of our livelihoods, but make February 14th an exception by planning a cozier date on campus. Not all dates have to be extravagant. Go the dorky route and film a cooking show episode together or marathon all of Teen Titans Go. The world is your oyster.
In truth, Valentine’s Day can be spent any way you want, as long as you and your S.O. are spending it together. After all, whether it’s the love of your life, your best friends, or your mirror, this day is less about what you do than it is about who you’re with.

It’s no surprise that most Harvard students aren’t big on school spirit and attending sports games—there’s a reason Harvard-Yale is the only day we’re #HarvardState. Here’s a lineup of some of the stuff Harvard Athletics has tried to bribe us with to show up and support Varsity sports.
Three t-shirts
Yes, you read that right. Three T-shirts. Who would give out only one when you can instead give out three? We suppose they had to raise the stakes at some point, but to be fair, it was also to go watch squash.
Fanny packs
We're not shocked that they're back in style (so convenient and fun!), but we are shocked that Harvard Athletics is onto the trend. If you dragged yourself all the way over to Lavietes Pavilion to see women’s basketball, you could be sporting a new Harvard fanny pack.
Food
See, now they’ve caught on. They’ve realized that the only thing college kids really value besides sleep is food. Free pizza and burritos are definitely dubs when you’ve exhausted your ability to eat HUDS.
Reward points and prizes
Harvard Athletics has an app, CrimZone Rewards, which allows students to check into games, rack up points for attending, and ultimately win prizes. There’s a blow-up couch and a polaroid camera on there, so you had better believe we’re also checking into the hockey game and tennis match when we go to watch basketball—you can never have too much furniture.
All we have to say is: Do less, Harvard Athletics.
