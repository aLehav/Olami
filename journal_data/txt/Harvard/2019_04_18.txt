This review contains spoilers for “The Twilight Zone.” 
When CBS announced Jordan Peele as the host and narrator for the reboot of “The Twilight Zone,” the casting seemed like a match made in heaven. Peele, of “Key and Peele,” “Get Out,” and “Us” fame, has demonstrated his mastery of comedy, horror, suspense, and the brutal-final-twist-as-commentary-on-America, all of which characterize the original 1959 television series. And though Peele is an executive producer on the show, contrary to what some might believe, the show’s first episode, “The Comedian,” was directed by another specialist in disturbing his audience, Owen Harris. Fittingly enough, considering he also spearheaded what is perhaps Netflix anthology series’ “Black Mirror”’s most celebrated episode, “San Junipero,” it makes sense that Harris would direct the reboot’s first episode. But whether it’s because Harris belongs more in the “Black Mirror” world, or because Peele spreads himself too thin creatively, there’s just something off about “The Comedian” — and not in a good way.
The episode stars Kumail Nanjiani as Samir Hassan, a lackluster comedian who serendipitously meets his idol, acclaimed comedian turned social recluse J.C. Wheeler (Tracy Morgan) after a disappointing set. As expected, Samir asks J.C. for some advice, which throws Samir into “The Twilight Zone.” “The audience don’t care about what you think. They care about you,” J.C. warns Samir. “Once you put it out there, the audience will take it in. They will connect. And once they connect to it, it’s theirs. And once it’s theirs... That shit is gone forever.” Of course, the words of advice turn literal when everything he subsequently jokes about propels him to superstardom, then is permanently erased from his life.
The problem with “The Comedian” is less about what it tries to do, but rather with how uninspiredly it does it. Each of Samir’s skits starts off with a joke about gun control and the Second Amendment — one that consistently falls flat — before he switches into what becomes the hilarious jokes about people who then cease to exist. The point writer Alex Rubens makes is clear: No matter how many mass shootings this country experiences, the Second Amendment — which itself runs counter to the way we enact gun control laws today — is the excuse Americans use to lull society back into a sense of complacency in a process that has, at this point, become a vicious cycle. Yet, neither Rubens nor Nanjiani tries to imbue the joke with any urgency or comedy, as if they, too, hardly care about the matter. And if the people behind the episode don’t care, why should we?
“You have one thing. One natural export. You are a country with one natural resource,” J.C. says to Samir. Unfortunately, that one export is as vapid as the jokes he tells. Samir is, for all intents and purposes, the average Joe. He has a girlfriend he’s been with since high school, he’s been a struggling comedian for years, and he has a dog. That’s… about it when it comes to Samir. As a character defined by his relationships to others, who does next to nothing to complicate the struggling artist prototype, Samir lacks the personality to make us care about what happens to him, and by extension, those who disappear from his life. It’s why the episode lacks a fundamental core, a pull that might draw people in besides the superstardom behind it. It’s why when Samir eventually, predictably, jokes himself into non-existence, no one bats an eye — not even the audience. Ultimately, the first episode of “The Twilight Zone” takes itself much too literally to warrant any thought or reflection on what it tries to say. As a result, “The Comedian” ends up saying nothing at all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The main event of Dunster House’s annual goat roast — the skinning and barbecuing of a locally sourced goat — has been cancelled this year, ending a decades-old tradition. In doing so, Dunster House Faculty Deans Cheryl K. Chen and Sean D. Kelly have cited health concerns and students’ potential discomfort with the event as the motivations for their decision.
We are saddened to see Dunster’s annual goat roast go. The unique and unconventional event distinguished Dunster from its fellow undergraduate Houses on campus. The goat roast is listed as a “go-to” event in descriptions of the House, showing what future Dunster residents can look forward to in terms of community-building events. This event, alongside the traditions of other Houses, such as Mather Lather, Thursday Lowell House Teas, and Eliot House’s Fête formal, are an essential part of House life, engendering a sense of community and pride among residents.
Aside from being a quirky part of Dunster’s traditions, the goat roast sparked thought-provoking conversations among students. The selection, transportation, slaughter, skinning, and barbecuing of the goat forced students to confront the reality of consuming meat, and talk about practices like vegetarianism. The tradition brought to light the production process that goes into every piece of meat we consume, perhaps making students more aware of the usually out-of-sight consequences of their eating decisions. Furthermore, the origins of the event, created by Human and Evolutionary Biology professor and then-resident tutor Daniel E. Lieberman ’86, are rooted in a desire to educate students about how our ancestors once lived, motivating the practice of using paleolithic tools to skin the goat. Events like these, where our horizons are broadened, are part of what make the Harvard experience so transformative and uniquely educational.
While we can’t help feeling a sense of loss in the end of this tradition, we understand that prevailing health concerns and the ensuing safety requirements make it hard to continue in its former state. We appreciate the concerns for students’ safety and well-being that motivated the change. Nevertheless, we hope to see an equally quirky and creative tradition replace the goat roast that will last for many years to come, and that any new iteration of the event will continue to be a staple of community life in Dunster. Hopefully, Dunster residents in the future will attend the new version of the goat roast and continue to have productive discussions over the evolution of the event, asking: “Did you know that we used to skin a local goat right on this lawn?”

When an image of a Harvard student comes to mind, it’s probably of a confident, determined individual who knows exactly what they want to do to change the world. Harvard students are ready to create companies, write novels, and share their skills wherever life takes them.
That isn’t me. I’m an 18-year-old freshman, faulted with a fear of the future and an inability to make decisions. I have several interests, ranging from the classics to computer science, biology to animation. I also have mild social paranoia and a fear of social interaction that has stuck with me since high school. My overall sense of insecurity was heightened by my sudden arrival into a sea of talented individuals who seem to know exactly what they’re doing and deserve all of the success they have already achieved.
One of the ways that my insecurity has implemented itself, surprisingly, is in the dining hall. Annenberg, the freshman dining hall, is a huge church-like space with rows and rows of tables, enough for hundreds of students to dine at once. During the first few weeks of fall semester, Annenberg was an exciting space, full of opportunities to meet my fellow classmates and create memories and friendships that would kickstart my amazing four years here at the University.
Being surrounded by so many people those first few weeks, however, and having to put on a smile every moment of every day started to tire me out. I slowly lost the energy to keep that smile plastered on my face or to even remember everyone’s names. I began to retreat into myself, sleeping early instead of attending events during Opening Days or staying in my room to do those first problem sets alone.
Soon after, I began to walk into Annenberg for every meal and see everyone else sitting at tables with their friend groups. I felt like I had missed my chance to meet people. Tired and alone, I retreated with earbuds into the back of Annenberg, sitting alone on my phone trying to drown out the constant laughter and conversation. Some people thrive in that setting, doing work, jamming out, or focusing on more important matters. But, for me, those moments were a testament to what I was doing wrong. With every familiar face that walked by without a wave, with every person I failed to speak to, I was reminded of my immense failure to reach out and connect to the people I most wanted to become close with.
My paranoia began to escalate as well, even extending outside Annenberg. When someone walked by without saying hello, I would analyze every interaction with that person and see if I had done something to offend them. With every conversation, I began to read a sense of annoyance or judgment in every word. Soon, not only was my ability to meet new people affected, but also my existing friendships. Instead of holding simple conversations, I was always trying to be interesting or relatable or funny, and doing my best to make people respect me.
During the first few months of the semester, I began to hear the term “duck syndrome” a lot, in introductory workshops on mental health or advising, as well as in everyday conversations. The term refers to the fact that ducks seem to move in the water without any sign of effort, even though their feet are paddling intensely below the water where no one can see. Harvard students often act in this way, pretending to have everything together while keeping their struggles to themselves. Campus culture here is very much achievement-based, and this focus on doing as much as possible pressures people to act like the best versions of themselves, even if they have other worries weighing them down.
I may not have seen that in the dining hall, but I did in my animation class this semester. When I heard that the theme for our final projects was “anxiety,” I immediately thought to portray my experience with isolation, paranoia, and insecurity. When I discussed my idea with the class, I found that people who I once thought were untouchable had similar concerns and even felt touched by my work. With these gradual realizations, I started to open back up. I didn’t have to pretend to be a person I wasn’t, I didn’t need to make it seem like I had everything together, and I didn’t always have to prove myself in every single interaction.
I feel like a very different person than I was when eating alone in Annenberg for the first time. The most important thing I’ve learned here at Harvard so far is that I don’t have to act like what I feel is expected of me. In the dining hall, I’ve stopped retreating to the back for every meal. I’ve begun to sit with people who once intimidated me, people who I wanted to reconnect with after the struggles I had been facing.  With help from my new dining strategy, I’m slowly finding a cohort of friends who are more supportive of me than I ever could have imagined.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some people might think of the idea of the college campus as a microcosm of society as flawed, since college students generally face less responsibilities compared to those who have graduated. However, this by no means indicates that a college student’s life is ideal. Even though college is in some regards a safer place than society as a whole, college students still face injustices and struggle to have their voices heard. What I have seen during my time at Harvard has made me realize that although college is not necessarily a microcosm of society, it does teach us important lessons about the world we live in.
Before coming to Harvard, I, like many others, was excited to study in a world-renowned institution that would support its students to the best of its abilities. Coming from a country in which it is deemed impolite to challenge authorities, I was curious to see how students in American universities are more outspoken about their beliefs and are not afraid to speak against those in power. Harvard both confirmed and denied my hopes of experiencing what it feels like to be on a campus where students are eager to advocate for what they believe in. I have been encouraged by students passionately advocating for issues ranging from the establishment of the ethnic studies concentration to Harvard’s investments in the fossil fuel industry and prison-industrial complex. But at the same time, I have also felt disheartened by our tendencies to forget about what our peers are fighting for and the sense of hesitation that students feel that prevent them from being vocal about their arguments.
What I have noticed from my life at Harvard is that there is a pervasive culture of desiring perfection and stability. One example of this is choosing classes. The more time we spend at Harvard, the less we place value on venturing from our comfort zones by taking classes that are unlike what we are accustomed to studying. I sometimes feel like college is no different than high school — a lot of us aim for perfection in grades and extracurriculars that solely doing something out of passion without regard of its impact on our grades and careers seems foolish.
The same goes with student advocacy. While there are student groups that advocate for various issues, there is also a significant amount of students who choose not to be involved in activism. Of course, not everyone should be expected to attend protests — after all, we all have different opinions. Yet, we should still be aware of what our peers are advocating for and be ready to support them if we are persuaded by their causes. We too often neglect the amazing work done by our peers to fight for a better Harvard. Another factor that may prevent students from voicing their opinions is the fear of retaliation. Students may feel hesitant to speak out or engage in activism if they fear that the University would punish them for their actions. The sense of hesitation to speak out is thus formed both by our own indifference and the fear of being attacked.
Harvard is by no means perfect. It often falls short in taking student opinion into account and creating a safe space for all identities. However, Harvard’s imperfections challenge us to identify them and propose solutions. We should be vigilant of how changes made by the university can affect our lives and strive to truly take ownership of this campus. This does not mean that Harvard should be satisfied with the status quo — it should strive to create a welcoming environment for students regardless of student protests. More importantly, it should make sure that no student faces limits in voicing their opinion due to fear of retaliation. The institution that exists to educate the world’s next leaders should not teach its students to submit to authority out of fear.
Even in life after graduation, we will be faced with the dilemma of whether to be vocal about the injustices we see around us or to stay silent and let those that are more passionate do the work. The fear of retaliation would also be present, this time with even greater risks than what we face as college students. In this regard, our experience at Harvard informs us of what to expect in the real world. Will we choose to neglect the injustices around us because we think engaging with them would negatively impact us, or will we be vigilant and vocal? The choice is up to us — but the choice we make now could influence how we navigate life after graduation.

Practically every surface in Robert N. Stavins’ office, including the door, is covered with one of three keepsakes — mementos from places he has visited and conferences he has attended, pictures of his family, or magnets with schedules of the Red Sox or Harvard sports teams. Stavins is the Director of the Harvard Environmental Economics Program at the Kennedy School, where he studies and teaches about the impact of resource use on the environment. Today, he is considered one of the world’s leading environmental economists. He has had a monumental influence on global climate policy, participating in many of the most significant discussions on climate change over the past thirty years, including the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the UN Conference of the Parties, which produced the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015. 
Fifteen Minutes sat down with Professor Stavins to talk about cap-and-trade, the Peace Corps, and what individuals can do to combat climate change. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
FM: How did you first become interested in the field of environmental economics?
RS: I started out interested in the environment and then went to economics. Whereas I think most environmental economists were economists and then they got interested in environment. For me, it started when I was in the Peace Corps. After I graduated from college I went to Sierra Leone, in West Africa, with the Peace Corps. I was there for about four and a half years. I was working in the development of lowland rice — paddy rice growing — and that's where I experienced for the first time the tradeoff between economic development and environmental quality.
FM: You've written a lot about international linkage [economic cooperation between different countries] as a way to solve climate problems, specifically the approach of cap-and-trade [a system that sets an international requirement for emissions reductions and then allows countries that exceed the requirement to sell excess emissions to countries that haven’t reduced their emissions enough]. What are your views on cap-and-trade specifically and the idea of international linkage more generally?
RS: Cap-and-trade is by no means appropriate for all environmental problems, but [it is] for certain environmental problems, namely those for which it doesn't matter where the emissions come from and what matters is the aggregate amount of the total. That's how we got leaded gasoline out of the market during the Reagan administration in the 1980s. And then it's how we cut acid rain by half in the George H.W. Bush administration with the Clean Air Act Amendments in 1990. These were very good applications. Climate change is also an excellent application, the reason being that greenhouse gases mix in the atmosphere, so it doesn't matter if a ton of carbon dioxide comes from Cambridge, Massachusetts, Beijing, China, or London, England — it's going to have the exact same effect. The result is that the overall target is achieved at the lowest possible cost in total, and that's the merit of these approaches. It's very pragmatic.
FM: You mentioned that your inspiration to become an environmental economist came from the time that you spent in Sierra Leone. What role do you think developing countries should play in the overall international goal of reducing the impact of climate change? How do they fit into the equation?
RS: This is the most important question and the greatest challenge addressing climate change because economists often look at efficiency and cost effectiveness. But distributional equity — fairness — is extremely important in the case of global climate change, and that's because countries have very different wealth. Some countries are wealthier than others, and some countries have contributed more than others to the accumulated stock of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It's a principle of distributional equity.
There's a very important role for developing countries, but I would separate them into two groups. One is the large emerging economies: China, India, Brazil, Korea, South Africa, Mexico, and Indonesia. Those countries are very large, with relatively rapid rates of economic growth compared to the industrialized world. The emissions from the industrialized world are flat or declining, so it's impossible to reduce emissions without those countries. The second group is the small, poor developing countries, but their emissions are trivial [relative to the large emerging economies]. The reason the Paris Climate Agreement was a partial success was that it brought the large emerging economies and the industrialized countries all on board, in particular, two countries: China and the United States.
FM: Is it feasible for economics alone to fix the problem of climate change? Is it feasible for clean energy alone to fix the problem? What is the relationship between the two?
RS: In general, it's ludicrous to think that any single policy is going to be able to do the job. Now, having said that, I think that it's going to have to involve market forces, either carbon taxes or cap-and-trade certainly in the industrialized countries and in large, complex economies.
It would be impossible to reduce emissions through individual performance standards or technology standards because it's not just electricity generation. It's every commercial facility, it's every residence, it's every motor vehicle, it’s every backyard barbecue grill, it’s every lawn mower. So the only way to solve that is by sending signals through the economy. Now, that's for the short term, but for the long term, it's certainly true that a huge amount of technological change is going to be required in order to do the job. With existing technologies, it would both be very costly and virtually impossible to reduce emissions to zero, which eventually is going to be what's necessary. For that, a great deal of technological change is going to be required.
Carbon pricing is necessary, but not sufficient. Technology policies that subsidize technology development or research — those kinds of policies are also necessary, but not sufficient. We need both.
FM: There's been a lot of discussion lately on the national level about the Green New Deal. What is your take on the Green New Deal? Is it feasible — politically or economically?
RS: The Green New Deal is a set of aspirations — very inspirational aspirations for a lot of people. But there is nothing that specifies what the policy instruments would be to achieve those aspirations. They are extremely ambitious. It's over my pay grade to say whether or not having extremely ambitious aspirations inspires action or whether they're so ambitious that people throw up their hands. Some people would point out that the Green New Deal may be one of the elements of the Democratic platform that will help to re-elect Donald Trump, because they are a set of essentially infeasible targets that are easily characterized in negative ways, which Republicans have already started to do.
FM: What is the responsibility of the average individual in confronting the issue of climate change?
RS: I've been bipartisan, working with both parties in the White House and with members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, but my honest answer is that if you live in the United States and you want to do something about climate change, the most important thing that you as an individual can do is to get involved in the next campaign. Make sure your friends get out and vote, because that's the way you can most affect things at this point.
Beyond that, though, there's a lot one can do. One can be doing very progressive work vis-a-vis climate change within private industry, one can be doing it within academia, or one could be doing it within non-governmental organizations. There's no particular sector that's cornered the market on wisdom or ability in this area.

Letters cut from assorted patterned construction paper spell out “history is power” on the classroom wall. Just below the letters, at the front of her 7th grade social studies classroom, stands Ellie N. Bridge ’17. It’s the day before spring break, and students fidget in their seats while awaiting further instruction.
For an independent project, each student created a website with information about nonviolent resistance. Bridge asks them to share which aspect of their assignment they feel most proud of.
Several hands shoot up. From the second row, one particularly enthusiastic student describes the webpage she designed about India’s history of using nonviolent resistance to combat British colonization. She later explains how this history can serve as a model to inform the current movement for gender equality in America. Several other students’ projects focus on gun control and the Black Lives Matter movement.
Bridge is a member of the second cohort of the Harvard Teacher Fellows, the program which began in 2016. HTF, a teacher training and education program, was developed specifically for Harvard graduates. Bridge, who earned a degree in History and Literature, gravitated towards teaching as a way to confront systems of injustice, especially racial injustice, in America.
“I joined the field of education because, particularly, I find history education to be the most underutilized tool for liberation of all time,” she says. “I am really, really interested in that idea and that concept, and that’s why I decided to become a teacher.” The world history curriculum she has developed for students at Prospect Hill Academy, a Cambridge charter school, focuses on British imperialism and its impacts on different countries.
Every year, dozens of newly graduated Harvard alumni go back to elementary, middle, or high school through various education programs, like Harvard Teacher Fellows and Teach for America. Harvard TFA recruiter Meredith Heckman explains that, without these programs, pathways to teaching are limited for students at universities that don’t offer undergraduate teacher certification programs. “That’s where alternative certification programs – like Teach For America, HTF – are really important because they create that pathway, when there is not one that existed previously.”
For three decades, TFA, which describes itself as a “leadership development organization,” has sought to promote educational equity across the United States by offering high-achieving students a clear pathway to a teaching career. Heckman says that TFA seeks out “outstanding, diverse student leaders” and then provides these students with “the training and support to ensure that our corps members really are leading their students to academic growth.”
TFA requires participants — called corps members — to teach for two years. If corps members don’t want to pursue the field beyond those two years, TFA believes that they can apply the skills they learned to create positive educational change in whatever profession they end up choosing.
Still, Katherine K. Merseth, senior lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and instructor of the popular Harvard College course United States in the World 35: “Dilemmas of Equity and Excellence in American K–12 Education,” detected persistent gaps in existing teacher training programs, like TFA, and saw Harvard students as an untapped resource in the struggle against educational inequity.
“I became aware that there are a lot of Harvard students who were being pulled off to go to TFA, and I said, ‘You know, what are we doing? They’re right here. They’re right under our noses. We’re not recruiting them. We’re not doing anything for them particularly.’” In response, by 2005, she had, along with Orin Gutlerner, produced an outline for the concept of Harvard Teacher Fellows, variations of which would surface in following years.
A decade later, the program had raised around $15 million dollars in funding. Merseth, who devoted her career to teaching, studying, and writing about education, wanted Harvard students to have access to “the best kind of teacher education that I think could be provided.” Merseth, as well as current HTF Co-Director Eric H. Shed, emphasizes the importance of building a program that allows Harvard students to enter their classrooms feeling supported.
Both of these programs have their limitations, but they are the principal options for graduating Harvard College students who want to teach. TFA requires that corps members teach for two years, and while HTF has never included a required time commitment, the original program included the stated expectation that fellows teach for four to seven years.
Shed adds via email: “There is no formal time commitment for fellows to stay in teaching. We have, and continue to, strongly encourage fellows to stay in the field teaching for several years. The ideal candidate for our program is committed to a career in teaching.”
However, some students do not have interest in remaining in the classroom long-term — TFA in particular is known for being a stop for students on the way to medical and law school. HTF encourages a more permanent tenure, but Harvard College itself shies away from openly inviting undergraduates to consider the teaching profession. Although Harvard recently approved an education secondary, Merseth contends that the nature of the undergraduate liberal arts focus de-emphasizes pre-professional studies.
“The climate of Harvard is that everyone is sort of focused in on a certain idea of success, which normally means applying to really prestigious graduate programs, or fellowships, or pursuing a well-paying job, so generally consulting, or tech, or finance,” says Will T. Li ’19, a fellow in HTF’s fourth and newest cohort. “Public service is generally, I think, not considered widespread to be the most successful career path.”
Harvard students interested in education may encounter an undergraduate community often focused on a particular vision of success — one that does not always afford visibility to the teaching profession. Those who choose to enter the classroom end up confronting another source of tension on their path to teaching: determining whether their vision of teaching aligns more with Harvard’s program or a nationally recognized one.
In her junior and senior years of college, Elianna M. J. Shwayder ’18, a current TFA corps member, was on the obligatory soon-to-graduate job hunt while finishing her degree. The process came with typical collegiate anxieties of determining next steps. Shwayder couldn’t help but notice the “overwhelming power that finance and consulting recruiting can have over the student body.” She discerned a pressure to attain certain jobs over others — specifically those with prestige or larger salaries over those in education.
“[Recruiting is] insane. Basically, it takes over people’s minds, it takes over people’s lives, and truly domineers the school’s culture,” she says.
According to the 2018 Senior Next Steps report from the Office of Career Services, 5 percent of Harvard graduates entered the education sector, compared to 13 percent in financial services, 11 percent in technology or engineering, and 10 percent in consulting. Since 2012, the proportion of graduates entering the education sector has ranged from 2 percent in 2015 and 3 percent in 2016 to 7 percent in 2013 and 2014.
Financial services has consistently landed in the 2nd or 3rd most popular post-grad path, after full-time graduate or professional school. In fact, in every year since 2012, more Harvard graduates have been unsure of their future plans than have chosen to work in education, excepting 2014.
If education only attracts 5 percent of graduates, teaching, logically, attracts less than that. This lack of interest may reflect a larger public trend of the devaluation of teaching as a profession. According to Learning Policy Institute, teacher salaries have decreased since the 1990s. Now, on average, teachers are paid 70 percent less compared to other college-educated professionals.
Samir Paul ’10, who participated in TFA after graduation, notes that the devaluation of teaching may have historical roots. “In this country for decades the teaching profession was subsidized by sexism and racism. So there were many, many incredible women and people of color to whom the professional world was closed off in really significant ways,” says Paul. “As those barriers began to break down a little bit, the notion of teaching as, say, ‘women’s work,’ and society’s… willingness to not pay or reward it in a meaningful way — it had a long term effect on the profession.”
Heckman, the TFA recruiter at Harvard, similarly ties the devaluation of teaching to its former status as women’s work or “an extension of women’s caretaking abilities.” She also connects the diminishment of the profession back to college campuses, highlighting how undergraduates at elite universities usually do not have access to traditional teaching paths.
“You cannot go to Brown or Harvard and graduate in four years with a teaching certification like you can at other colleges,” says Heckman. “I think that speaks to a larger devaluing of the teaching profession, and it’s why it’s so important to not only have programs like Teach For America but to have programs like Harvard Teacher Fellows and Urban Teaching Fellows and Boston Teacher Residency and really to create alternative pathways into teaching.”
Beyond the routes into teaching available for Harvard graduates today, the idea that teaching is not a first-choice career may be ingrained into some students’ mindsets. “I think something students come up against is this feeling of ‘I went to Harvard, I have this degree, now I have to do something next that proves to the world how smart and successful I am,’” says Heckman. “Teaching is often not the thing that our world sees as that highly prestigious next step.”
Similarly, Merseth notes a hesitance about teaching grounded in economic concerns — namely from students who are seeking out salaries that will enable them to repay loans and support their families. “You can be noble and poor,” Merseth says. “But if you’re here, really honestly, because you want to provide for your family, I can’t change that.”
The opinions of friends and family members can also deter Harvard students from pursuing a teaching career — even when that career begins at TFA, a well-recognized program that has roughly a 15-percent acceptance rate. Derek Z. Paulhus ’19, a rising TFA corps member who ultimately aims to attend law school, encountered skepticism from his father when applying to the program. “[My dad’s] like ‘you’re graduating from Harvard. You’re going to be a teacher?’” says Paulhus. “He was kind of like, ‘You have good grades. You have good credentials. What are you doing?’”
Aishah I. R. Ahmed ’20, a future TFA corps member, plans to eventually attend medical school. But, like Paulhus, she had to work to convince her parents that teaching could not only be valuable in the short-term but also grant her beneficial skills for her future in medicine. She even cited examples of successful doctors who participated in TFA to help her mom “find solace in [her] decision.”
Even for students who intend to teach long-term, the perception that education is a temporary career or stepping stone still lingers. In fact, a handful of leading finance companies, including Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, have established partnerships with TFA. Some of these firms will defer applicants and prompt them to join TFA for two years before returning to banking.
The perception of teaching as a placeholder before a second career irritates some students. “I didn’t like how, on TFA’s website, they would show alumni… like, “Oh, these people, after two years, went on to do something else,” says Ata D. Amponsah ’19, a member of HTF’s fourth cohort. “It seemed like they were emphasizing using teaching as a stepping stone for other things, and I didn’t want to because I didn’t like the idea of using students in that way.’”
In an email, Heckman restates that the mission of TFA is contingent on “diverse leaders working together at all levels of the systems and across all sectors – inside and outside education.” The TFA website therefore highlights alumni who currently influence other professional fields, as well as those who have remained teachers. "Eighty-four percent of our alumni network continues to work in education or in a field that impacts low-income communities,” she adds.
While many students perceive TFA as a site of transience within education, approximately 60 percent of TFA’s 60,000 alumni currently work in the field of education, and half of that group continues to work as full-time teachers.
“No one goes into TFA or teaching in general, especially in underprivileged communities, to just use it as a stepping stone,” says Paulhus. “You do it because you actually are interested in doing it and want to make a difference.”
Regardless of why Harvard students enter teaching in the first place, the profession certainly presents an opportunity to gain concrete skills. George E. Goodwin ’17, who entered HTF after graduation, attests to an unmatched skill set that teaching provides. “I know I’m learning more, and I know I’m acquiring more skills, especially in the department of management and leadership, in a way that you just couldn’t get in an entry level job in another industry,” he says.
“Taking the pay cut in the short term is pretty great when you look at the skills you’re acquiring. Pretty good advertising for teaching as far as I’m concerned.”
For current Harvard students interested in teaching, TFA and HTF are arguably the most widely discussed options for jump-starting a career in education. Before the introduction of HTF in 2016, TFA largely dominated this field, attracting Harvard students through strong recruiting practices.
Even a decade ago, TFA had established a reputation at Harvard, encouraging the likes of Spencer H. Hardwick ’11 to join in its efforts. “Teach For America had a big presence on campus, and I really loved the message they had on framing education as one of the central issues in the 21st century,” he says.
Although it may not boast the national recognition of TFA, HTF has more recently gained traction among Harvard students, becoming an increasingly popular avenue into post-grad teaching. In 2016, HTF’s first cohort included 18 fellows, expanding to 21 and 27 fellows in 2017 and 2018, respectively.
Beyond TFA and HTF, a range of other opportunities exist for recent grads to enter teaching. Still, prior to HTF’s creation in 2016, TFA was the most visible option — and Merseth perceived gaps in its model.
“I suppose you can say that I have respect for TFA, but I have some very deep concerns about the extent of training that people get before they go into these very difficult teaching placements,” she says.
Heckman responds via email, referencing TFA’s highly selective, data-driven admissions process that works to determine the most qualified applicants and ensure that “transformational leaders are in front of students.” She also cites TFA’s 5-8 week summer training program, which fulfills preliminary state liscenery requirements and includes intensive teacher training to inform classroom management and cultural mindfulness. She also explained that corps members continue to receive individualized coaching in their next two years in TFA.
Merseth is not the first to express dissatisfaction with TFA’s program structure and approach to teacher training. A 2014 Crimson article reported that a group of students from Harvard’s Student Labor Action Movement urged the university to sever ties with the organization until TFA made the following changes: place corps members only in regions experiencing teacher shortages, improve the extent and depth of their teacher training and resources, and discontinue partnerships with companies that potentially oppose teacher unions. Existing ties between Harvard and TFA include on-campus recruiting of undergraduates and connections between Harvard’s graduate schools and TFA alumni.
TFA has endured its share of critical media coverage, and because HTF was created as an alternative to TFA, it’s easy to see HTF as a new-and-improved version of the program. Still, 55 current Harvard seniors have already applied to TFA’s 2019 corps. Harvard students continue to display a concerted interest in TFA, despite previous student objections and the creation of HTF.
HTF and TFA share the same fundamental goal: to combat education gaps in America by placing promising teachers into low-income school districts. But their approaches diverge from there. TFA is a self-proclaimed “leadership development organization” that works to get capable students into the classroom and encourages those students to champion educational equity in their future professions, whether or not they become teachers. On the other hand, HTF is principally a teacher education program. It strives to provide its fellows with intensive training and support to facilitate their entrance into the classroom and, like TFA, promotes educational equity.
TFA‘s short-term mission focuses on recruiting promising students and placing them in one of its partner schools across 51 different regions. Corps members participate in a 5-8 week long training program before their first fall in the classroom in which they teach under daily observation and observe other teachers themselves. They are then expected to fulfill a two-year classroom commitment. “In the long term,” says Heckman, “you are always a part of Teach For America, and our big bet for how we’re going to change our country is that our alumni are going to go off to become leaders in whatever sector they choose to go into.”
The TFA alumni network of more than 60,000 current and former corps members is a draw for applicants who wish to connect with educationally-minded professionals across the country. TFA corps members can also pursue a master’s in education from partnered universities during or after their two-year commitment.
TFA’s nationwide reach also gives corps members some flexibility in preferencing their placement locations. Applicants rank 10 locations out of an available 51, at least one of which must be “high need” as designated by the organization. With this range of placement options, applicants can weigh the costs and advantages of various locations. They can also return to teach in their hometowns, a practice TFA encourages. Paulhus, for example, was particularly interested in teaching in his hometown in Miami, and TFA enabled him to do so.
Offering less variety of placement opportunities, HTF currently partners with 12 different schools from five states, including Massachusetts, New York, Texas, Colorado, and California. Compared to TFA class sizes, which reached 3,717 corps members in 2018, HTF cohort size has peaked at 27.
Inherently there’s variation in quality of experience between placement locations because of the program’s wide reach. In addition to any support corps members may receive from their school, TFA provides affiliated regional advisors, but these support systems look different for every corps member.
“My experience has been that you, with Teach for America, get about as much support as you ask for,” says Austen J. Needleman ’18, a current corps member. “Because I’ve had a really good support network at my school, I haven’t tapped into Teach For America resources as much, but I know people who have less support within their school have tapped in a little bit more and have had more intensive coaching experiences.”
Maeva M. O’Brien ’18 was interested in teaching, but wanted to avoid burnout. “HTF made it very clear to me that they perceive [burnout] as a major problem in the education system, and so their goal was to counter that problem by offering a lot of support to their first-year teachers.”
HTF gradually introduces teachers to the classroom in hopes of mitigating burnout. Students begin taking courses in Harvard’s School of Education their senior spring, before teaching summer school in local urban areas under supervision. In their first year, fellows teach part-time with coaching from an assigned advisor, simultaneously taking courses and shadowing other teachers. The following summer, fellows complete requirements for Massachusetts teacher certification.
“In theory, you won’t end up in an impossible situation for your first year out,” says Goodwin of HTF’s training. “That took away a lot of the burden that I was worried about and was pushing me away from teaching.”
Still, HTF did not fully lower all barriers to entry — its initial time expectation of four to seven years still proved daunting.
“You see the commitment is four to seven years, you say, ‘All right, I can do that,’” says Goodwin. “But, I mean, I think seven years ago, I didn’t have facial hair. So, how are you supposed to make that kind of commitment when you’re 22?”
HTF ultimately removed its original time expectation, detecting George’s hesitance among other students. Harvard students simply could not predict their interests and professional lives so early on. HTF Co-Director Noah S. Heller decides to let the benefits of teaching speak for themselves, saying “our belief is that when Harvard Teacher Fellows experience the wonderful and challenging profession that is teaching, that they will see it as something worthy of their energy and passion for a good long while.”
HTF’s commitment to longevity is salient to Jerry G. Nelluvelil ’18, a member of the third cohort. “It felt like I was being supported more and that the culture was more towards true social justice education and truly caring about being in the classroom for an extended period of time, as opposed to some other alternative teaching program that wanted you to be in it for two years and then do something else.”
“Sometimes I feel bad because I literally teach two classes, and then I spend the rest of my day observing other people, doing lesson plans, doing unit plans, doing grad school homework,” says Rachel K. Silverstein ’18, a current HTF cohort member. “The people from TFA, they’re trying to get all the same things done, but they’re also teaching twice as many classes.”
HTF’s significant funding enables this kind of balance. Fellows earn half their salary from working part-time at their schools, and HTF subsidizes the other half. Fellows can also earn their master’s from the Harvard Graduate School of Education for a significantly reduced price. First-year teaching is notoriously difficult, but HTF’s resources aim to ease the transition as much as possible.
Harvard’s resources offer significant support for first-year teachers, but cohorts are quite small. Merseth’s extensive experience and position at the Graduate School of Education enabled her to develop a program that aims to produce particularly capable new teachers. Still, the applicant pool is restricted to Harvard students because fellows must be on campus during the spring of their senior year.
Some current HTF participants acknowledge that a cohort comprised entirely of Harvard students is somewhat flawed. “Something that I think about and that I’ve talked to fellows about a lot is the fact that we got to Harvard, so we’re all good students,” says Silverstein. “[This] makes it a little bit difficult to empathize with those students who are not the people that we were.”
Especially at a university that historically resists vocational training, some may sense a veneer of elitism lingering beneath HTF’s position as a Harvard-specific alternative to TFA. In response, Merseth notes that “when Harvard does something, people notice. Should I begrudge that? Yeah, maybe. But I think in this case we’ve got a damn good model. And so, sorry if you’re offended, but we’re going to do it.”
Samir Paul currently works as a teacher-educator at the University of Maryland, where students follow an apprenticeship training model, incrementally increasing their responsibility in the classroom in each quarter of the year. While he appears passionate about this method of gradual teaching, which resembles that of HTF, he also appreciates his experience with TFA in retrospect. He recalls that his “first year of teaching… was extraordinarily difficult, but also it was a time of really incredible growth for me as a teacher, as a practitioner, and for my students, too… I don’t know if I would trade that experience for anything, but it certainly was difficult.”
While Harvard’s announcement of the Education Secondary in April 2018 indicates the college’s increased focus on education, Harvard is also the last Ivy League school to initiate this type of program.
“I’m not going to condemn Harvard. I think perceptions of teaching that I may have experienced at Harvard are a symptom of a larger problem that we are having as a culture of Americans,” says Goodwin. “I think that it is important for people at Harvard not to try to divest themselves from the fact that they are representing American culture.”
Merseth proposed the education secondary five years ago, and she maintains that part of the administration’s hesitance to approve it stemmed from Harvard’s position as a liberal arts college. Merseth says that she envisioned an interdisciplinary study of education, but the Faculty of Arts and Sciences administration perceived the program as a teacher training or recruiting project. As an institution that aims to encourage diverse academic pursuits, Harvard could not facilitate a department that would possibly operate as vocational development.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris explains via email: “No one in administration was hesitant to support the secondary field in principle. The broad focus was determined early, and gave no one pause. The hesitation revolved entirely around questions of governance and oversight.” He adds that FAS leadership appreciated the dedication of Graduate School of Education faculty to the secondary but wanted to ensure that FAS faculty would be able to contribute to establishing requirements, advising students, and serving on the oversight committee. FAS faculty “needed time to clear other commitments before they could take on this service.”
In the Office of Career Services, director Robin E. Mount says that counselors present options to students who express an interest in education, but, ultimately, they are “Switzerland.” In other words, from a careers standpoint, advisors will never push a student towards a designed path.
Julie A. Reuben, Graduate School of Education professor and director of Harvard’s education secondary, suggests that the diminished importance of teaching stems from visibility. “There’s a lot of visibility for the financial industry, for consulting, for tech industries.” As a result, she posits, it seems as though “more Harvard students want [those careers] and care about that than they really do.”
Daniel Abarca ’16, a TFA alum now working in the education sector, detected this lack of attention paid to teaching as a post-grad option, particularly compared to other professions. Companies visited and publicized opportunities in the private sector through fancy events, boasting free, expensive food and drinks. Teaching jobs struggle to compete with this level of prestige, leading teaching opportunities to fall to the wayside.
Although Harvard may deem the active encouragement of teaching to be beyond its scope, the landscape of education opportunities seems to be changing, if not advancing. Along with the education secondary, HTF has emerged as a tangible sign that Harvard values teachers and wants to foster their development. Alumni also recently created a “Shared Interest Group” that connects Harvard students interested in education and graduates already in the field.
Mount remains hesitant to say that Harvard itself has spurred these developments, given that donors funded HTF and alumni started the shared interest group. She sees the secondary, however, as “the College making a statement about investing in that area.”
While the education secondary is not expressly designed for aspiring teachers, Reuben says that “we certainly would be excited if one of the outcomes of the secondary is that some people would consider teaching as a profession, but that isn’t our purpose, and of the people that are in the ed secondary, many of them will not.”
The push for the education secondary has generated significant student involvement, both in terms of advocacy about creating the program and in developing it further. Members of the Undergraduate Council filmed a video to encourage its development, and the secondary’s student advisory committee has started to collaborate with OCS in hopes of increasing the visibility of education as a career path. However, in a liberal arts college reluctant to actively steer students towards teaching, those with concern for the future of the profession may need to take matters into their own hands.
Silverstein, who graduated last year, recalls being struck by the general perception of teaching as a career path on Harvard’s campus while attending an education careers panel. “There was one person on the panel who had taught, and it was for one year. And that was kind of the moment where I realized like, ‘Oh my god, the stigma is real,”’ she says. “I hear it from my students, as well. I would bet if you asked every single HTF cohort fellow, none of us have not had a student say, ‘Oh my god, you went to Harvard? Why are you here?’”
“It breaks my heart every single time I hear it – imagining these, but any kid, doesn’t think that they are deserving of an education coming from someone who went to an institution like Harvard.”

On a Friday afternoon outside Pierce Hall, we find ourselves inside a silver, state-of-the-art airstream trailer examining microscopic plankton. Mollie Thurman, our tour guide for the day, is projecting the tiny organisms beneath the white microscope onto a flat screen TV perched at one corner of the high-tech trailer. She asks what we think the translucent blob bouncing on the screen could be. “Is it that thing that eats algae?” we respond, scrutinizing the squirming specimen. She gives an encouraging look, raising her eyebrows expectantly.
“Plankton…?” we venture again.
“It’s a type of plankton!” Thurman responds excitedly. It’s a Daphnia plankton, to be exact. She then proceeds to point out the organism’s eggs and rapidly beating heart.
Thurman is one of the lead scientists at BioBus, a mobile science laboratory that offers demonstrations like this one primarily at underserved schools across the United States. For the past week, BioBus has roamed Cambridge, visiting schools and participating in the annual Cambridge Science Festival, which runs from April 12 to April 21.
Harvard’s Molecular and Cellular Biology department funded BioBus’s stint in Cambridge, allowing the bus to visit schools completely free of charge. Six undergraduate student volunteers, most from the course LS50: “Integrated Science,” and three graduate student volunteers from the MCB department are working with BioBus during the festival.
BioBus’s mission has long centered around uplifting communities that are underrepresented in the sciences, reaching out to minority, female, and low-income K-12 and college students to encourage them to pursue the scientific disciplines. Biobus has visited over 250,000 students at more than 500 schools since its founding in 2008, according to its website.
“It's an incredibly exciting time, and the tools and the resources that we have at our disposal as scientists are just unparalleled,” says Sarah J. Weisberg ’08, a chief scientist and executive vice president at BioBus. “But that world remains pretty hard to access for so many people, and that means that the impact of the discoveries are limited — it means that the ideas are less diverse than they could be, it means we have a less equal society.”
“Both knowledge and resources are concentrated in a smaller set of hands,” she says.“And it means that that joy and excitement is limited and distributed unfairly.”
Ben Dubin-Thaler founded BioBus in 2008 after completing his Ph.D. in Biology at Columbia University. BioBus originated as an experiment to test Dubin-Thaler’s hypothesis that, given the opportunity to use research-microscopes to perform hands-on experiments, anyone would fall in love with science, according to its website.
“He was debating between either [going to] do a prestigious post-doc in Singapore or buy an old bus on Craigslist and convert it into a mobile lab,” Weisberg says. “And he chose the latter.”
In 2010, Weisberg joined the BioBus team after graduating from Harvard College with a degree in Biology and Linguistics and completing a Masters of Science degree in Cell Biology at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.
Though Weisberg says she enjoyed her time researching, she was frustrated by her inability to communicate it to people outside her field.
“I felt really lucky to have ended up in a place like Harvard where I could get real lab experience — and those experiences were transformational to me. I had a lot of support along the way, a lot of luck, a lot of privilege to get there,” she says. “I was very conscious of the fact that for the vast majority of people, especially if they're coming from communities of color, low-income communities, that they would just never have fell into science the way that I fell into it.”
Today, BioBus has expanded beyond its original bright yellow and blue 1974 bus to include the additional airstream trailer. Thurman explains that the company also now has a relationship with Columbia University, where they have partnered with the Zuckerman Institute to make science more accessible.
BioBus now has a space in the ground floor of the Jerome L. Greene Science Center on Columbia’s campus. Thurman says this fits nicely with the company’s larger goal of getting students excited about science — now in a concrete space in addition to a mobile bus.
While we tour the airstream trailer, Thurman shows us BioBus’s impressive electron microscope, one of the very few electron microscopes that can be put on a tabletop. After a lengthy process requiring a volunteer to apply pressure to the microscope in order to create a vacuum, the intricacies of the tiny feather underneath the microscope come into focus.
The microscope projects a colorless image of the feather onto a TV. It is nearly impossible to discern its original feathered form from the abstract criss-cross line pattern now filling the screen. Thurman recounts that just the day before our tour, a middle school student had a “lightbulb moment,” realizing that the feather was in black and white since there was no light entering the electron microscope to give it color.
These are the moments — when students are suddenly excited by what was once confusing — that BioBus strives to create.

The first rowing scene in the movie was filmed before dawn, Dan J. Boyne recalls. There were “six pairs, two oared shells, racing… full-tilt toward a boom camera off of a tree,” he says. “We're almost colliding every take. And this is before the sun came up.”
Boyne is describing a scene he helped film for “The Social Network,” the 2010 drama about Mark Zuckerberg’s invention of Facebook while at Harvard.
Boyne, director of Recreational Rowing at Harvard, was called in to assist the production crew, who knew nothing about rowing, with the filming of the movie’s essential rowing scenes. As he taught them, it’s a lot harder to film on the water than on land, and they spent two weeks attempting to capture ten seconds of footage. He nonchalantly summarized the experience of working alongside celebrities such as Armie Hammer as “interesting, but very stressful.”
In addition to the occasional celebrity rowing lesson, Boyne is in charge of all things non-varsity rowing at Harvard. He oversees the intramural rowing program and Harvard’s sculling program, coordinates the graduate schools’ rowing clubs, and sometimes helps walk-ins get acquainted with the sport.
When we first catch a glimpse of Boyne, he is helping a woman carry a single scull (a two-oared boat designed for one person) into Weld Boathouse from the Charles River. He later tells us that that was her first time on the water, ever. It was a cold, windy day in early April — and he was her instructor.
In spite of his demonstrated rowing expertise, Boyne thinks of himself as an amateur: a person who does and loves an activity for the sake of the activity, rather than for material gain.
“I read somewhere that, the more you know in a broad base or range of subjects, the closer you would be to divine knowledge. ’Cause if there is some divine force, that of course would be all-knowing,” he says. “That seems like a highfalutin concept, but for me, if you’re always learning something and you're always switching, you are in more of that state of, like, authentic wonderment.”
Perpetually in the pursuit of this authentic wonderment, Boyne has published four books, all of them rowing-related, earned his Master of Education from the Harvard Graduate School of Education, trained to become a licensed yoga instructor, and traded rowing lessons for guitar lessons with prolific folk musician Livingston Taylor — all while working full-time for Harvard.
Boyne says he has two major concerns as a rowing instructor. One is the constant vulnerability to the whims of the weather, and the other is safety. “One of my first years on the job, I actually saw someone get killed on the river,” he says. “Hit by another boat.”
Boyne’s firsthand experiences with the dangers of rowing don’t end there. “I [had] another sculler [a person who rows with two oars] at Henley, in England — it’s a big race. He was at the starting line.” It was his oldest student, a 70-year-old, in a single. “And this eight [a fast-moving boat with eight oars and eight rowers] was on the wrong side of the river and it hit him. And it grazed him, but he had the yellow paint from the… boat, in his, like, backside.”
The pressure of being a rowing instructor is, for Boyne, part of a constant quest to find his edge. “If you're a writer,” he asks, “how can you be authentic by just really relaxing into your own personal comfort zone?”​​​​​​
An English major at Trinity College, Boyne says he could easily have gone the path of many of his friends, becoming a writer or a teacher. Instead, he became a rowing coach. He founded the Tufts Varsity Women’s Crew team out of Newell Boathouse in the 1980s. From there, he was recruited to work at Harvard in his current job, a position he accepted so he would be able to pursue his writing and other passions in addition to rowing.
In the 33 years he has been a rowing instructor at Harvard, Boyne has taught, by his own count, thousands of people from across the globe how to row — celebrities, state police, ex-navy SEALS, and the occasional Harvard student walk-in. However, he insists that even the most revered people are, in reality, ordinary — a fact revealed once he gets them on the water. “That's the thing about rowing. People can have great importance, self-importance, and they get out in the boat and it’s no longer there.”

Several people have called Dan P. McKanan’s ’89 office a fire hazard. Stacks of books are crammed into every corner. Some are relics from his time in graduate school, both at Vanderbilt and the University of Chicago; others are renewed yearly from the Harvard Library.
McKanan is currently the Unitarian Universalist Senior Lecturer at the Divinity School where he teaches classes including HDS 2005: “Theology without God” and HDS 2773: “Religion and the Left.” Lying atop a stack of books in the center of the room is his most recent publication, “Eco-Alchemy: Anthroposophy and the History and Future of Environmentalism.” In the book, McKanan traces the environmental history of anthroposophy, a Christian spiritual tradition that dates back to the nineteenth century and is understood as a spiritual science rather than a religion.
His work outlines anthroposophical teachings concerned with the biological and spiritual interconnectedness of agriculture. “There's an understanding that certain spiritual forces stream down to earth from various cosmic realms, and the farmer is working with those spiritual forces,” McKanan explains. In this worldview, ideas of biological interconnectedness are embedded within ideas of spiritual interconnectedness.
McKanan’s path to anthroposophy was twofold: his early interest in both sustainable agriculture and intentional communities — a label which includes communes, kibbutzim, and ecovillages — led him to the spiritual philosophy.
His involvement with the former began while he was at graduate school. McKanan started working in community supported agriculture (CSA), a share-based and community-focused model of farming that offers greater insurance for farmers. He purchased a share in a farm and later learned it was a biodynamic farm, which is a form of alternative agriculture linked to anthroposophy. “In most major cities, the first CSA farm was biodynamic, because a very significant source for the CSA idea was people in the anthroposophical movement trying to connect the agricultural ideas of the movement with the economic ideas,” he explains.
In addition to agriculture, McKanan worked with intentional communities — groups of people living and working toward a common purpose. McKanan first joined the International Communal Studies Association because of his prior work studying the Camphill Movement. The movement aims to bring together children and adults with and without intellectual disabilities in supportive, residential communes and is based off of anthroposophical ideas.Today he chairs the ICSA’s board.
“It's kind of a model of reverse inclusion where instead of saying, ‘how can we make mainstream society, mainstream neighborhoods, more hospitable to the people with intellectual disabilities?’, the Camphill model is: ‘how do we create communities that center the distinctive needs and gifts of people with intellectual disabilities and invite other folks, people who are not labeled as having a disability, to share in the work of creating community?’” McKanan says.
McKanan resists common narratives in his study of intentional communities and anthroposophy. “One big debate in communal studies is about is the relationship between longevity and success: Is it appropriate to measure success in terms of longevity?” McKanan asks. “And I would say the majority of communal studies scholars are invested in the idea that you shouldn't [conflate the two], that a community can be successful even if it doesn't last very long.”
In addition to his study of anthroposophy, he also explores the intersection of spirituality and civic life through American political left. His 2013 monograph, “Prophetic Encounters: Religion and the American Radical Tradition” outlines the prominent and often-overlooked religious dimension to the American Left from the 19th century to the present. His goal, as he explains it, “[was] to correct the notion that all the religious energy is on the right side of the political divide.”
He also aims to add nuance to a generalized narrative that there is a sharp divide between the religious left and secular left. Instead, he argues that religion is often deeply intertwined with progressive movements and political beliefs. Though he acknowledges that the United States has been relatively successful in separating church and state institutionally, he often repeats a maxim learned from Martin E. Marty, his graduate school professor: Church and state ought to be separate, but religion and politics never can be.
Society doesn’t organize itself into neat categories such as religious and secular, McKanan believes. “Depending on how you define religion, people's deepest values are religious values," says McKanan. "And if you're not going to bring your deepest values to bear in your political engagements, what's the point of the politics?”

I’m 15 and I’m in homeroom, at 8 a.m. on Wednesday.
The class clown is a blonde, curly-haired boy with blueish eyes. I have liked him for a while, so I laugh at every joke, and shimmy my rolling desk chair over to the circle that inevitably forms around him.
Maybe I bring up my Dad not letting me go out over the weekend, or maybe I describe the quirky ways he encourages me to study. Maybe we are watching the Gangnam Style video and I mention my dad told me he self-identified with PSY.
I don’t remember exactly how it happens, but suddenly my own father is being imitated, loudly, in this classroom, by this boy. His voice morphs into some amalgamation of Mr. Yunioshi from “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” and Long Duk Dong from “Sixteen Candles” and what an 1800s Chinese Exclusion Act cartoon would sound like if it could talk. Every couple of sentences, he throws his head back, spews a gasping laugh, turns to me and says, “I’m so sorry; this is horrible.”
But he laughs as he says it. “No; it’s fine,” I tell him, and I raise my voice at the end of the sentence to assure him, to authorize the joke.
He jumps right back into character.
I tell myself that he’s not targeting me. As he performs to the entire classroom, I feel myself melt into his audience. I do not think he is attempting to make a complex political commentary on the use of accents. I am not sure if his intent is to satirize. I hear my own laughter. All I know is that to him, the joke is that someone, an Asian someone, speaks English differently than he and I do.
“My dad doesn’t even have an accent,” I say, as though it is part of the joke.
Maybe I don’t know yet how to express my discomfort. Maybe, in that rolling chair circle in homeroom, I feel too alone to speak up:, to spotlight myself, and my Asianness, and my Asian parentage. Maybe I’m impressed by the way he can command a crowd. Maybe I like the attention. Maybe I feel seen by this boy I like.
When the same boy says my dad is Ken Jeong in The Hangover, maybe I just can’t see my Asian peers sitting in the the back of the room, shifting in their seats. Maybe I don’t yet know to look in their direction.
***
I’ve never tried to describe H-Mart before, but here is what I’ve come up with: Red, white, and blue neon signs and cool overhead fluorescent light that reflects off mirrors jutting from the ceiling and the shiny, lacquered walls. Asian pop and hip-hop beats pulse and synth through invisible speakers. Groups of Asian twenty-somethings chat conspiratorially, hunched over ramen and fruity-looking drinks.
I’m here to meet Isha Patnaik and Brandon K. Lee, the producers of Affirmative Reaction: An Asian (American) Comedy Show, a monthly stand-up show in Boston with an all-Asian comic line up. The show began this past August. I spot an available table in the nook of the dining area, and once seated, I flip through the questions in my notebook:
“Is social change a part of this show’s purpose?”
“How do your personal experiences with race and stereotypes enter your comedy?”
“Do you think there’s anything we can’t joke about?”
I purse my lips and sigh, glancing aimlessly at the single diners transfixed by their phones. I’ve never seen an Asian comedian not reinforce stereotypes of themselves in a set.
When I say I’m Asian American, it is a political claim, one made in an attempt to grasp at some slippery idea of justice. My identity is austere, an instrument, power. I’m skeptical that a show centered on Asian comedians and their representation will make me feel differently.
A sentence in the online description reads, “We feature the best stand up from the Asian and Asian American community and don’t care whether or not it makes our parents proud (it doesn’t).”
I’m not particularly excited to listen to two hours of “Asian parents, am I right?” jokes.
Another confession: I used to hate H-Mart. In fact, I used to hate all Korean grocery stores. Surrounded by shrimp crackers and seaweed, all packaged in crinkly wrappers covered in a language I couldn’t read or understand, I would hug the aisles, trying to shrink myself into the shelves.
Every approach from a woman with crow’s feet around her eyes felt like a threat; every Asian face in the store became a strategically placed test of me and my Koreanness. I wanted to be rid of it — my Koreanness — if only so that I wouldn’t have to face the blank stare of a Korean grandmother after I spoke back to her in a flustered, frustratingly American jumble of “Oh, uh, I’m sorry. I don’t understand.”
Outside the Korean grocery store, I took pride in being as far off the boat as possible. Inside the Korean grocery store, though, I would tiptoe down the aisles, as if louder steps might trigger some non-Korean alarm, weaving swiftly in between the Korean families, making eye contact only with the speckled tile floor. Every fluent Korean syllable uttered by another young Korean American kid formed another dent in my American armor.

When Patnaik walks up to me, I feel immediately at ease. She wears an orange shirt as chipper as her voice.
The first 10 minutes of our conversation: She tells me about growing up in a predominantly Asian neighborhood of the Bay Area in California, going to college at a markedly less Asian Tufts, and befriending Lee, in part because they were some of the only non-white students in Tufts’s comedy scene.
Lee strolls up to our table and Patnaik turns to introduce me.
"Vivekae? Am I saying that right?"
"Yes, and I want to make sure I'm saying your name right —"
"Isha."
"Isha," I repeat.
"Braaaannnndon." She introduces Lee, drawing out the syllables of his first name. As we laugh together, I feel the conventionally strict reporter-interviewee binary blur.
Patnaik and Lee tell me that even though Asian comics are relatively well-represented in the Boston comedy scene, there are a dearth of spaces for Asian comics to support each other. After Lee describes mulling around before shows in Boston surrounded by exclusively white and male comics, I do a mental double-take. I had thought this “Asian American Comedy Show” was isolated, borne out of a nebulous, trendy claim to ‘real’ representation, rather than a material need.
They describe how audience members sometimes seem to find the racist build-up of their jokes more funny than their pithy, comedic analysis that follows.
Sometimes Lee struggles to know how much he can joke about race, considering his audience. Patnaik describes the difficulty of navigating joke subjects, given the types of reactions she has encountered: audience members who praise her for “making fun of her own culture” (a real after-show interaction she cites) and people who seem to find it “refreshing” to see a woman of color not talking about being a woman of color.
I nod along as they describe the difficulty of simply existing as Asian comedians. As Asian. Whether in the high school computer lab or pushing a grocery cart past 20 pound bags of rice and plastic-wrapped packages of yellow-y fried fish, I know that weight, that compression.
***
The morning of the show, I listened to K-pop with the curtains open to let the sun illuminate my morning ritual: brushing dark, goopy chunks of mascara onto my eyelashes in an attempt to bring life and width to eyes I’ve been told too many times, by many of my closest friends, were “so Asian.”
As I absently swiped at my eyes with the mascara wand, I wondered: What might I do to my eyes if I were born and raised in Korea? How many different choices by my ancestors converged such that I am sitting here, preparing to interview, in English, two Asian-American comedians at a Korean grocery chain from Queens?
My morning ritual felt hollow, like listening to the ring of a coin hit the bottom of an empty well in the village my father left when he was five.
That night, on the way to H-Mart, I took the Red Line to Central Square. There were several seats between me and a twenty-something Asian man. I stared at our joint reflection in the darkened window in front of us. I compared my face to his: the curve of our eyes, the sweep of our chins, the width of our cheekbones.
I don’t know where the man came from, where his parents came from, or where his grandparents came from. All I saw was dark hair with a side shave, black converse, a green backpack, Airpod knockoffs. One of billions designated as Asian.
Where was he headed? Maybe Downtown Crossing? Chinatown?
When I visited Chinatown two weeks earlier, a close friend and I walked into a bakery and sipped bubble tea, a drink I didn’t know was considered a staple of Asian America until I came to college. I was going to try an egg tart for the first time.
Walking through Chinatown has always felt like meeting a distant relative or watching Crazy Rich Asians. It’s feeling as though people might think I look like the female lead in this decade’s hallmark Asian American movie, but I don’t understand that game, the one with the tiles... ‘Mahjong.’
Asian. Asian American. Korean. Korean American. I never felt like any of them were mine. So — an Asian American comedy show. What does that even mean?

One Friday each month, comedians at Affirmative Reaction don’t have to calculate how much they want to self-censor. "I just wanted to feel like, for one night a month, that I didn't have to explain myself," says Patnaik.
After our H-Mart interview, Patnaik and Lee lead me to ImprovBoston where the warm, wheaty smell of stale beer greets us. Our designated theater space is small, with a stage no more than ten feet wide.
We make our way back to the lobby again to take photos and Patnaik asks an Asian woman sitting by the blue-ish glow of the neon window lights what brought her to the show.
She chuckles. “Definitely the Asian thing,” she says.
As the house opens, I watch people file in — young and middle-aged Asian faces scan the rows for optimal seating arrangements. The flow of leather jackets, spiked hair, Converse, cross-shoulder bags remind me what it is like to be in a place where you’re a majority. I feel lighter.
After her joint introduction with Lee, Patnaik begins her set.
"Hi, I'm Isha, I'm a queer South Asian, female comedian." To the scattered and supportive woos, she says "Thank you. That's how my parents react. Just tepid woos."
Patnaik describes a visit to India. After witnessing one Uber driver’s flippant response to almost hitting a scooter driver, she asked herself: “‘Wait. Is it culturally insensitive of me to think that hitting people with cars is bad? Like, am I being a weird colonialist person by being like" — here, she raises her voice into a vaguely British tenor — "'In America, we don't hit people with cars, like, that's just something we do in the Western World.'”
Her voice is confident and light. Unburdened and unafraid. It’s how I want to sound when I speak.
She and I, we’re both in the little space between here and there. Wedged under the door between two places we supposedly ought to know. But in that moment, the uncertain, complicated business of navigating who she is onstage, in public, anywhere — it doesn’t make Patnaik pull away. She pushes forward.
My cynicism about what the show can really accomplish for Asian America, what power it can really offer us, dissipates. I sit, I listen, and I understand. My easy laughter weakens my militancy. These comedians and I are having a conversation, and we don’t need a big wooden table in a Harvard seminar to talk about diaspora, our parents, and Asianness in America. We don’t have to explain unbelonging to each other.
Andrew Vu takes the stage and talks about a voice he uses when he’s back home in Texas. It sounds like the dad from Leave it to Beaver. I crack up, doubling over. I know what it’s like to be watched vigilantly by non-Asian faces scanning for grammatical mistakes or a tremor in my voice.
Many don’t even open with identity-related jokes. Jere Pilapil talks about his boring job: "Sometimes I go down to the vending machines and I crumple dollar bills just to see what it'll take," he says, lowering his voice into a faux-menacing growl.
Diana Lu deadpans, deliberating on every word. "Anyone who thinks my humor is too dark is a racist."
I laugh so hard I can’t breathe, leaning over and sideways like one of those floppy inflatable tube-men in front of car dealerships, covering my mouth. For brief moments, I wonder if I should maybe try to keep it together. Something tells me that I don’t need to do that here.
In this crowded, 40-seat backroom of ImprovBoston at this sold-out show, the punctuating laughter from the bigger theater directly adjacent erupts every so often, audible but muffled through the dividing wall.
But I keep laughing. This small backroom, with its single spotlight and three rows focused on one Asian face, feels like the biggest room I’ve ever been in. As I bound out of the theater after the show, I don’t feel my feet touch the ground.

It’s 7 p.m. on Thursday, April 11, and every seat in the Citywide Senior Center is occupied.
White-haired activists shift in their chairs, whispering about the upcoming decision. Each party’s lawyer presents their case. The audience grows more and more lively, and one by one, individuals step up to the microphone to share their concerns.
The public comment period is now over, and the Cambridge City Board of Zoning Appeal delivers its decision: the appeal to stop construction in Inman Square has not been granted. The room goes silent.
This was the latest attempt by Inman Square residents and businesses to stop the City Council’s planned two-year renovations of Mayor Alfred E. Vellucci Community Plaza, the park off of Inman Square’s major intersection. The new design aims to reduce the number of car and bike accidents at the intersection of Hampshire St. and Cambridge St., which has been the site of ten bicycle accidents and 50 car accidents in the three years prior to fall 2018, including a fatal bike accident in 2016.
However, Friends of Inman Square, a group of residents and businesses, say the redesign won’t make the intersection safer. Rather, they claim the City Council plan will both be detrimental to local small businesses and fundamentally alter the personality of the Square.
Safety concerns are the main issue at hand, and Friends of Inman Square has disputed the safety of the city’s plan. The group’s website claims that three “safety flaws” for pedestrians and bicyclists are created by the City’s redesign.
In January, preparations for construction began, and four locust trees were removed from Vellucci Plaza to allow for the rerouting of Hampshire St. Friends of Inman Square protested the event, but to no avail. Now, three bulldozers and construction cones sit on spray-painted asphalt where there was once a shady cluster of trees. A fading plastic sign with a construction update leans against a nearby bulletin board.
John R. Pitkin, one organizer from Friends of Inman Square, says that he felt he had no choice but to participate in the group’s activism. “It’s going to completely change the character of the area that I live in. I would love to ignore it. This is not how I want to be spending my time. The city is just doing something that is not in the interest of the residents who are living in the city,” he says.
In September, the City Council voted 7-2 to approve the redesign plan. According to Friends of Inman Square, as of March 15, 2019, 15 businesses had signed a petition to stop the redesign.
Jenny D. McBride, one of the petition’s signatories, is a co-owner of Inman Oasis, a massage parlor and wellness center that has been in Inman Square for 13 years. McBride is worried about the construction’s effects.
“Parking will be an issue, getting around will be an issue, [and] noise will be an issue,” McBride says. “I think some of the businesses out here will feel vibrational impacts from digging up the street.”
Pitkin estimates that the construction will eliminate half of the public parking spaces in the business district, which many local businesses depend upon. “Some of those businesses will not survive,” he says.
However, not everyone agrees that stopping the city’s current plan is the right thing to do. Virginia B. Johnson, owner of gather here, a fabric and yarn store, did not sign the Friends of Inman Square petition. She says that her affiliation with the East Cambridge Business Association Board was part of her decision to refrain from signing.
“The reason that I don’t want to be included on this list is that currently, I feel like it’s in my best interest as a small businesses owner to find ways to positively work with the city to ensure that whatever impact this construction project...has doesn’t negatively affect our small business,” she says.
Johnson also feels that Friends of Inman Square has not paid enough attention to the severity of the Square’s safety problems. “Obviously, something needs to change, and I didn’t feel like [the group] addressed the fatality issue,” she says, referencing the 2016 accident.
In addition to safety, members of Friends of Inman Square are also concerned about the cost and duration of the project, which will total $6 million dollars and last about two years. “I have a bridge to sell you if you think it’s only going to take two years,” Berman jokes.
Even more than just cost or length, residents feel that the redesign is part of a larger move away from the personal feeling of the Square they know well. Many residents do not feel that their voices have been heard by the city government. Pitkin says, “The city refused to discuss the alternatives.”


However, the city government claims that the public was involved in the decision process. “During the design process, we evaluated many different options for improving the safety of Inman Square and we firmly believe that the final plan is the best viable solution for improving Inman Square so that it is safe for all and creates a vibrant open space in the heart of the square,” wrote Katherine F. Watkins, assistant commissioner for engineering at the Cambridge City Department for Public Works, in a statement over email.
Watkins added that over the course of the design process, six “widely attended public meetings” were held, as well as other “approval processes” including open houses and a Tree Removal Hearing.
Yet according to Pitkin, the Cambridge City Planning Board, in accordance with provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, should have been required to hear the presentation of alternative design plans. Pitkin alleges that the council decided on a plan, but no alternatives were presented. However, according to Watkins, “During the design process, [the City] evaluated many different options” when considering the redesign of the Square.
Pitkin hired a lawyer and tried to appeal their decision. On April 11, the zoning board decided not to grant the appeal because it found that “the City’s laying out and construction of a public way is not subject to zoning,” Watkins wrote.
Friends of Inman Square doesn’t buy the zoning board’s argument. “We thought the board was going to follow what the law said, but they’ve made an interpretation that is poorly reasoned,” Pitkin says, criticizing the City’s enforcement. He is unsure of what he plans to do next. “We have an option of appealing to court… The question is whether that would do us any good,” he says.
Berman worries that Inman Square will face the kind of development seen in other parts of Cambridge. “Harvard Square is a place where you can find any chain store that you want, and we don’t want Inman square to be like that,” she says.“We want our small, local, independent stores.”

A few Fridays ago, I went to a lecture called “Let’s Talk about Sex” by Nancy Bauer, a Tufts professor. Bauer’s thesis was that we should talk about sex more. She stood at the podium, giving a lot of theoretical reasons why talking about sex would improve issues of consent and also make sex better. She didn’t specify the shape of these conversations, or how to make them come about. She spoke as though fruitful conversations about sex would materialize from sheer will, as if we’d suddenly have the vocabulary and the tact to effortlessly talk about sex. But, just because one agrees that we should talk about sex doesn’t mean we know how to.
In the winter, somebody asked me, “what do you like?” I began to answer, but then my voice dwindled. There was a horrible moment of dead air. I felt childish. How could I not know what I wanted? It wasn’t that I didn’t want anything, rather, it was that I didn’t have the imagery or the vocabulary to explain specifically what I wanted. Recently, a friend told me that it’s hard to be asked what she wants. Like me, she feels like she doesn’t have the adequate base of knowledge to sift through for an appropriate answer — she’s been trying to figure out what that answer is.
After the room had been quiet for too long, I asked the other person what they wanted. They were ready. They didn’t seem to be grasping for answers in the same way that I was; the words, the images appeared easily to them.
***
If you’ve been watching porn for longer or been having sex for longer, it seems as though ideas about what you want, or simply what’s possible, are clearer, real, accessible. If you’ve seen it done, you can say it out loud. The person with the bigger sexual lexicon takes up more space in the conversation.
It’s not that Bauer’s explanation is impossible — I think I lived it once. I was with someone and we did not overthink, or plan, and words appeared without calculation. Moment after moment, they asked me, “is this okay?” Our interaction felt like walking down a long hallway; they stopped when they felt like it. The questions weren’t asked to fill a quota of consent — they were asked for the sake of it, for the pleasure of asking.
A few weeks later, I was with someone else who also continuously asked “is this okay?” But this person asked like they wished they didn’t have to. They asked as if it was an obligation; it felt less like a question and more like a challenge. Like: see, I did what I was supposed to do. They asked like they didn’t want me to say no, so it didn’t really feel like they were asking.
A lot of people I know, many of them men, say that asking “is this okay?” makes sex less sexy. Constant questions “ruin the mood,” they tell me. It’s as if they think they have a certain number of “do you like this?” chips to cash in before the net sexiness starts to enter the negative.
Maybe it’s “less sexy” to ask because questions make the possibility of “no” present and concrete while having sex. Maybe people are unconsciously afraid to ask these questions because they remind us that two answers are possible. It’s not that they don’t want to let people say “no,” rather that the very reality that “no” is an option is unpleasant and just easier to ignore.
This is my suspicion about what’s going on when people dismiss or begrudgingly ask for continuous consent: D’Angelo is playing, and there’s a healthy amount of nervous laughter. Everything feels nice, it seems as though you are both into it. For some, it seems like asking “is this okay” suddenly introduces “no.” It’s as if asking makes the whole process feel illicit. When you have to ask for permission, it can make you feel like you’re doing something wrong. It’s much easier to remain silent until necessary, to not riddle the entire experience with such precariousness, the constant knife’s edge.
***
Recently, I sat in the dining hall with my friends and we tried to articulate why sex is better when people feel free to ask is this okay. We felt it was important to convince the people we knew, but we struggled finding the words for why. We were sharing a table with a large group of boys and we had our conversation loudly, daring them to overhear. This was the best we could do.
I keep coming back to that moment in the winter when continuous consent felt natural. I can’t explain why that person asked when they did, or even count on my fingers how often they asked. I wasn’t keeping track and neither were they. They asked not in order to check a box, but because there is pleasure in asking.
With each question, the hookup gains stakes, a momentum of affirmation. There is a rhythm of consent, which builds from, rather than ignores, the reality of two answers. So, the same power which fuels this anxiety around “no” can be repurposed as pleasure: taking off your shirt means something, and that is sexy.

This was not how we envisioned our Tuesday night: doing the sprinkler dance move in the lobby of the Harvard Innovation Lab to Pharrell Williams’s “Happy.” Yet 20 minutes into Kassi Underwood’s meditation event, we both found ourselves swaying awkwardly with about 25 other university affiliates and local residents, most of them middle-aged, looking vaguely to Underwood in her shimmering silver jumpsuit for direction.
The dancing, however unusual, served a highly pragmatic purpose. As the meditation advisor at the Harvard Innovation Lab, or i-Lab, Underwood’s practice centers around pinpointing the origin behind the common fear of what others think of us. To her, examining the lies we tell ourselves is integral to becoming released from this anxiety.
This is the difference, says Underwood, between her work and the kind of inspirational quotes we find on Instagram: what she calls “intellectual” versus “transformational” meditation. “Seeking ‘enoughness’ from the quote card is making it even worse because [people] are not getting it — then they feel like there’s something wrong with them,” she explains. “There's so much self-help wellness and spiritual bullshit out there right now, and we're just filling our heads with knowledge.”
But for Underwood, this knowledge only complicates the process of liberation from the “lies” we tell ourselves. “We need something that's going to take us from where we are to where we want to go, which is ‘I genuinely am free from the fear of what this person thinks of me.’”
At the event, we received packets, neatly branded with her copyright and web address, concretely guiding us to Underwood’s goal: an action plan based on new beliefs about ourselves and the lives we want to create.
For Underwood, meditation has an interpersonal meaning as well as an individual one. She uses dance to create a space that fosters the vulnerability amidst the pulsing beats of her thoughtfully curated playlist.
“People are often rocketed into the present moment because dancing is awkward,” Underwood explains. “So then we’ve had this experience together, and now, dancing is truth; now we can talk about what’s really going on inside of our heads — which is that we’re fucking terrified.”


Currently a masters candidate at Harvard Divinity School, Underwood herself created the position of i-Lab Meditation Advisor. The idea came to her while meditating. Afterward, she contacted the i-Lab director to make it happen — taking agency to shape her prefered reality and thus putting into practice the advice that she gives her clients.
Now she helps individuals and groups within the Harvard community to create a spiritual “toolkit,” which she defines as a “problem-solving repertoire that [her clients] already have based in spirituality or wellness.” Not religious herself, Underwood works with people from all religious and spiritual backgrounds, yet despite their differing beliefs, she has noticed similarities between all of her clients.
“Usually, [clients] come in, and everybody says, ‘I used to do all this, but then I started at Harvard and I don’t do any of my things anymore’ — you know, ‘I used to pray, used to meditate, or I used to do yoga, and then I got to Harvard and I stopped doing all of my things and now I'm curled up in bed and I’m crying and I feel depressed and I keep getting on my own case for not being able to get it all done. And I’ve got 10 pounds of apples that need to fit into a five pound basket. I don't know how I’m going to do it.’”
Underwood’s approach is simple: “We take it back to ‘okay, let’s put those things back in place that you were already doing. And then, let’s up-level those.’”
Underwood believes that meditation serves internal benefits, but that it also has the potential to transform societies through the action borne out of mental transformation. For Underwood, changing one’s internal mindset can open new external realities.
“If everybody's meditating and getting honest with themselves and being truthful, then a lot of people are going to realize, ‘I'm at the wrong job; ‘I want to work at that job,’” she explains. “So then we're going to all do this big rearrangement, and we're all going to end up happy and happily where we're supposed to be, and nobody's going to be living these big, fat, bold-faced lies.”


Underwood hopes to leave her clients with the mental confidence to create their own realities — as she achieved in her own lifestyle.
In her new role at the i-Lab, Underwood aims to put The Practice into practice — and cultivate mental freedom for the Harvard intellectuals she calls her clientele. “I honestly think that everybody in the world needs a spiritual teacher, a coach, a somebody who's going to be working one-on-one with them, with their mental health,” she says. “I don't see how we're going to survive on the planet if we keep pretending we're not all suffering.”

“Let me tell you something to begin with: I’m an idealist.”
That’s how Isaias A. Medina III begins the conversation. “I’m a dreamer, man,” he adds.
Medina, a 53-year-old lawyer, is also a kite-surfing instructor, Vaishnava monk, former Venezuelan diplomat to the United Nations, and current Mason Fellow at the Kennedy School.
“I've wanted to change the world since I can remember,” he informs us. “This is something printed in my heart.”
**
In late 2016, he was told, over Friday afternoon drinks at the UN delegate lounge, that he was
“Harvard material.” A colleague and diplomat from Cyprus told him about a Harvard program she had completed, the Mid-Career Master in Public Administration Edward S. Mason Program at the Harvard Kennedy School. He decided to apply.
“I did my essays that whole weekend,” he said, “just locked myself in my apartment, let my dreams out.”
Fast forward to early 2017: The situation in Venezuela under Nicolás Maduro was becoming a humanitarian crisis. Medina, awaiting his acceptance from the Kennedy School, watched from the UN Headquarters in New York as his country fell apart. Police murdered student protestors, people died of starvation and illness, and his delegation sided with Maduro.
For Medina, the situation forced a reckoning. “I just had to draw the line in cement,” he says.
Medina resigned from his position on June 14, 2017, two months after his acceptance to the Kennedy School, and promptly began receiving death threats. He deferred his enrollment for a year to advocate for intervention in Venezuela full-time from his New York apartment. He was eventually granted political asylum in the U.S., which has allowed him to stay here since leaving the UN.
“I wanted to go home with these guys and fight in the streets, but I understood that my place was to be the voice of the voiceless Venezuelans for the international community … and I became that.”
Medina did 120 interviews with the press about the crisis in Venezuela in the first three months after he resigned.
He enrolled at the Kennedy Schoollast summer. The Mason Fellows are politicians, educators, entrepreneurs, and military service people from 60 developing countries, and they make up half of the 250-person class of the Mid-Career Master program. Medina says that his experience among the Mason Fellows has, thus far, mirrored much of what he loved about the UN.
“At the UN, we had meetings every hour and a half on completely different issues. You would go from climate change to diplomatic immunity to the ICC. And then I was doing security council. It was amazing; there were 50 different agenda items, so that is like [the Kennedy] to me.”
On the Tuesday of our interview, Medina’s Kennedy Schoolschedule was similarly packed and motley: he went from IGA 220: “The Politics and Ethics of the Use of Force,” taught by J. Bryan Hehir, to Douglas Johnson’s IGA 388: “Nonviolent Resistance in the Age of Authoritarians,”’ and then ended the day with a simulation of a negotiation in leadership for environmental conflicts. He says he hopes to apply what he learns here to situations back home –– if, someday, he is able to return to Venezuela. In the meantime, he is looking to create change from Harvard’s campus.
While in Cambridge, Medina is occupied with much more than his classes. In 2019 alone, he’s taken leadership roles with Tactical Governance LLC, a policy consulting firm advertising broad expertise, and Lazarus Institute, a think tank focused on “the maintenance of peace and security, and the resurrection of democracy, justice, and freedom in Latin America,” as he describes it.
Medina also serves as president of We Care 2030, an environmental advocacy group. “Together, we will be the trend setters of clean environments and vital ecosystems that will provide a healthy future for generations to come,” proclaims We Care’s website in bold, capitalized print. It lists seventeen goals to be achieved by the year 2030, many of which — “no poverty,” “zero hunger,” and “gender equality” — are not related to the environment.
Medina does have a strictly -environmental pet project, an early stage app called the Earth Club, which awards its users credit for environmentally -friendly behavior.
“[When] responsible consumers are responsible producers,” he says, the effect is revelatory. “Boom! You change the world immediately.”
“We need to change the economy in order to change the world. Today, what's rewarded is to accumulate money, which is paper. What's money gonna be worth if we don't have a world to live in?”


**
Medina was born in Caracas, Venezuela in 1966, into a political dynasty. His grandfather, Isaias Medina Angarita, was the president of Venezuela from 1941 until 1945, and his father, Isaias Medina Felizola, was a congressman and ambassador.
The third Isaias Medina attended a Canadian boarding school, returned to Venezuela for college and law school, and then began a career in the private sector. He worked as legal counsel for Corporacion Venezolana de Guyana as it privatized Venezuela’s aluminum industry, and later served as a foreign associate at Gibson, Dunn, and Crutcher LLP, a corporate law firm on New York City’s Park Avenue.
Medina had aspirations of making partner there, but that changed, he says, when his father passed away.
“He was a workaholic,” says Medina of his father, “and so I said, after he died, ‘Is this really what I want? 110 hours a week? To do what — not even enjoy your life?’”
So Medina left corporate life for a 15-year-long world tour.
From 2001 to 2007, he resided in Venezuela, California, and India –– “following my heart and my spiritual master, Srila Govina Maharaj” as a Vaishnava disciple. Now, Medina practices Buddhism.
Then, he traveled to Margarita Island, north of the Venezuelan mainland, and began the next phase of his career.
Kite-surfing quickly became his new passion. “The kite's name was ‘Inferno.’ Can you imagine the speed? I learned for the first time, and I became an instructor.”
He stayed on Margarita Island until 2009, when Medina, as he tells it, “fell in love with the island next door, which was called Isla de Coche.” He left kite-surfing behind and hopped one island over to begin building a holistic hotel, until the deteriorating political situation in Venezuela delayed construction.
“And then I moved to Costa Rica: same thing, man.” He lived on a turtle reserve with no running water or electricity, where he would go every day to collect freshly laid turtle eggs and bring them inside to hatch. “They'd be born, then you take them back. It was beautiful.”
He also led eco-tours, surfed, and ran a vegetarian restaurant in Playa Hermosa. When that got old, he moved to another island, Cubagua, where he lived amongst the island’s other inhabitants –– seven fishermen –– and slept in a hammock.
“My life was just sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset,” says Medina.
It wasn’t until 2015 that Medina returned to the mainland. Back in Venezuela, his mother’s friend, Justice Hildegard Rondon de Sanso, offered him a position in the country’s UN delegation over breakfast. Medina surprised the judge with his “long hair, earrings, tattoos. I came [there] in my flip flops!”
Nevertheless, his experience secured him the job, and he was ready for the next chapter of his odyssey, excited as ever.
“I’m gonna keep doing what I’m doing,” he promises. “Fighting the good fight, speaking for the voiceless, bringing about change.”

The Cambridge City Council passed a law last week to establish a 20-mile network of protected bicycle lanes across the city and implement a five-year sidewalk and street construction plan.
The legislation, termed the Cycling Safety Ordinance, stipulates the city must provide suitable accommodations for bicycle travel on Cambridge streets that undergo construction. The bill aims to advance Cambridge’s Vision Zero action plan, an initiative established in 2018 to improve transportation and promote “safe, healthy, and equitable mobility for all,” according to a statement on the city’s website.
The ordinance seeks to eliminate fatalities and injuries by mandating that the city construct a “connected network of permanent separated bicycle lanes.” The legislation, passed as an amendment to the Cambridge Municipal Code, defines permanent separated lanes as bicycle lanes that are protected from motor traffic by a “permanent vertical barrier.”
The cycling ordinance has drawn media attention, and bike safety advocates have praised it as the first legislation of its kind.
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux said she thinks it is “obvious” that Cambridge cyclists lack a “minimum standard of protection,” but also said she is hopeful that this law will make biking safer and, as a result, more popular.
“We've allowed the car culture to really take over city planning in a way that we're now understanding has had really negative impacts on a lot of quality of life issues, a lot of environmental issues,” she said.
There have been more than 700 reported accidents involving bicycles since 2015, according to Cambridge Police Department data.
The Cycling Safety Ordinance is the product of a collaboration between the City Council and local advocacy group Cambridge Bicycle Safety. The Council first introduced the legislation in January, following a year’s worth of discussion with the group.
Sam B. Feigenbaum, a volunteer with Cambridge Bicycle Safety and current Harvard Law School student, said he thinks the ordinance could mark an important step forward in making protected bike lanes “as ubiquitous as sidewalks.”
“We have space that’s set aside for pedestrians, and we have space that’s set aside for cars and cyclists,” Feigenbaum said. “Right now we're in this in-between world where we're expected to mix it up with cars to a degree that's not safe.”
Feigenbaum also praised the grassroots effort involved in advocating for the legislation.
“We're an all-volunteer group, and so dozens of people have spent a whole lot of their time working on this to make it happen because they think that it will make the community a better place,” he said.
Some Harvard students said they think the ordinance could help make their daily commute safer.
Lily Gao ’21 said the current bicycle lane system makes her “nervous” when she rides in the city, but she hopes the new law will change that.
“I think it will really change biking around campus,” she said. “I think it'll be much easier to get around Cambridge.”
Calvin Marambo ’19 said he thinks separated bicycle lanes would make him feel more comfortable around the “reckless” drivers in the city.
“Safety wise, I think it’s going to be good for me because I am someone who is always very careful, especially given the culture in Boston,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sarah Whiting, the dean of architecture at Rice University in Texas, will be the next dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Design, the University announced Wednesday.
Whiting will succeed Mohsen Mostafavi, who announced he would depart at the end of this academic year in October 2018, bringing his 11-year tenure as dean to a close. Mostafavi's resignation comes after Harvard affiliates circulated a spreadsheet in spring 2018 detailing anonymous allegations of sexual and racial misconduct perpetuated by men in architecture. The document included accusations against Mostafavi and other Graduate School of Design affiliates.
During her nine-year tenure at Rice, Whiting helped restructure the school of architecture’s curriculum, worked to enhance facilities on campus, and increased funding for research and course development. Whiting also chaired search committees for several administrative roles in the arts and humanities.
Whiting also serves on Rice’s board of trustees as part of the building and grounds design subcommittee.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said Whiting has a “keen understanding of design” and has engaged with some of the “hardest challenges” in design that contemporary society faces in a press release Wednesday.
“Sarah Whiting is an outstanding leader with broad interests that range across the design disciplines and beyond,” Bacow said. “She has a keen understanding of the intellectual dimensions of design and its distinctive power to shape the world of ideas.”
Bacow also said he looks forward to Whiting’s return to the Graduate School of Design, where she served as a design critic, assistant professor, and associate professor in the Department of Architecture from 1999 to 2005.
“I have been deeply impressed by her during the course of the search, and I greatly look forward to welcoming her back to Harvard,” he said.
Whiting said she is “thrilled” to return to Harvard and is excited to work with the “remarkable” students, faculty, staff, and administrators at the Graduate School of Design.
“The GSD has long been a center of gravity for my thinking and actions, and I’m thrilled to be returning,” Whiting said. “It is altogether tantalizing to look across the School’s three departments, with their individual and collective capacities to shape new horizons within Gund Hall.”
An expert in architectural theory and urbanism, Whiting’s work focuses on the connection between architecture and politics, economics, and society. Whiting was named educator of the year by DesignIntelligence in both 2014 and 2018, Architectural Record magazine’s Women in Architecture program in 2017, and by the Houston chapter of the American Institute of Architects in 2016.
Mostafavi said Whiting has a strong “intellectual commitment to design education” and that he is excited for her to lead in the press release Wednesday.
“Sarah Whiting is an exemplary academic leader and colleague,” Mostafavi said. “I am delighted that she will be returning to the GSD to help shape the next phase of this incredible School’s journey.”
Whiting’s appointment comes after students organized around the dean search. One group re-published an open letter identical to one published 12 years ago during the last dean search in an effort to argue that many of the same issues at the time are still pertinent today. The letter included calls for the search committee to find someone who would support “interdisciplinary collaboration” and make an effort to increase faculty diversity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has reduced its debt load by roughly $1 billion and increased its reserves in preparation for a potential future recession, University Chief Financial Officer and Vice President for Finance Thomas J. Hollister said in an interview Wednesday.
Hollister said that the reduction in debt is part of an effort to soften the blow of a potential future recession. During the 2008 recession, Harvard did not lose its AAA rating — the highest possible credit rating — but the financial collapse prompted the school to put a more significant focus on planning going forward.
“The number of changes in financial planning, readiness, discipline, and focus is dramatically different,” Hollister said. “In that respect, the crisis was not wasted.”
Harvard’s total bonds and notes payable have decreased from $6.28 billion in 2010 to $5.30 billion in 2018, according to the University’s financial statements from each year. This category is the largest component of the University’s debts, which also include other liabilities, such as retirement obligations.
Hollister also said most Harvard schools have been able to use budgetary surpluses in recent years to build up “rainy day funds and reserves” for future downturns. Both the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Harvard Medical School have seen financial troubles in recent years, with the Medical School running a deficit in nine of the last 10 fiscal years.
When the 2008 financial crisis struck, Harvard’s endowment took a substantial hit, falling from $37 billion to $26 billion, a negative 27.3 percent return. The endowment, currently valued at more than $39 billion, did not fully recover from this loss until 2017.
Former University President Drew G. Faust said in a May 2017 interview that the crisis was a tumultuous time to be overseeing the University’s finances.
“Just in a matter of hours you watched the markets crash, and you felt this urgent emergency was going on before your eyes, and you didn't know if by the end of the next day the endowment would have fallen another 10 percent or 15 — when was it going to stop? Was there going to be no endowment left at all?” Faust said.
The University also put off its capital campaign for several years and cut staff across the University in order to keep its fiscal house in order. Some cuts, such as nixing hot breakfast in the upperclassmen houses, have not been restored since.
In the event of a future recession, Hollister said Harvard’s schools have plans in place to make sure operations will not be dramatically constrained.
“From a planning standpoint. . .I give all the credit to the schools and units. They go through scenario planning of what would we do in 18 months if we have a recession, and how do we act or ready ourselves in case that were to occur,” he said. “So, I would like to think that the University systematically across the board is doing all the right kinds of thinking and in the event of the inevitable downturn.”
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in a September 2018 interview that he had “challenged” all the schools to conduct this scenario planning in anticipation of an eventual recession.
“What are we going to do when we have a recession — not if – I guarantee you there will be a recession, I don’t know when it’s coming, but it’s important to think about it in advance,” Bacow said.
Still, Hollister said a future recession could have negative effects despite the University's planning.
“What I can't say is that it won't be painful,” he said. “What I can say is that we hopefully won't be unnecessarily surprised.”
Correction: April 18, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Tom Hollister said the University may have to make cuts during a future recession. In fact, he did not mention cuts during the interview.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former University President Lawrence H. Summers and former Senator Gary W. Hart of Colorado cautioned Democrats to moderate their political platform ahead of the 2020 presidential election at an Institute of Politics event Wednesday.
Summers, who moderated the event, said he thinks the upcoming election parallels the 1972 race, in which Hart managed George S. McGovern’s unsuccessful presidential campaign against incumbent Richard Nixon.
“The Democratic Party had lost a very close previous presidential election with a candidate from its establishment,” he said. “There was a very strong sense that the party needed to turn in a big new direction, that it needed to become far more progressive, that it needed to dismiss established political leaders and follow the passions of young people.”
Summers also said he thinks that in both elections, Democrats felt pressure to cater their platform to “people who felt intensely rather than reaching to the middle,” that economic disparities formed key campaign issues, and that some candidates championed initiatives designed to redistribute wealth.
Summers — who served as secretary of the treasury under President Bill Clinton and an economic adviser to President Barack Obama — said he thinks Democrats should learn from the lessons of the 1972 campaign in order to avoid a similar defeat in 2020.
Hart agreed with Summers’ analogy and said he does not think focusing on government redistribution programs was a winning strategy in 1972.
“Redistribution programs generally in American history have only worked in bad economic times,” Hart said. “If the economy is fair to good, a program that has massive redistribution probably isn’t going to work.”
More than 50 College students and Cambridge residents attended the event.
Perry Arrasmith ’20, who attended the forum, said he decided to come because he was eager to hear Hart speak.
“I ended up reading about the 1984 presidential primary and the 1988 Democratic primary and how media evolved during those events. In the process of doing so, I heard a lot about Gary Hart’s policies,” he said. “He was definitely a revolutionary politician, so I was interested in hearing him speak.”
Arrasmith added that he thinks the event was “great” and offered a timely history lesson.
“I think in the last few years Americans have been talking a lot about how our politics have evolved over the last thirty years,” he said.

Harvard’s Institute for Learning in Retirement, a program that provides continuing education opportunities to retired seniors, revised its membership renewal process and committed to decreasing its use of University subsidies last month.
The program, which runs out of the Division of Continuing Education, comprises approximately 550 retired or semi-retired professionals who worked in various industries, including education, architecture, and government.
The changes — outlined in HILR’s revised handbook — aim to open more spots for new participants in the program annually and make current participants more aware of the policies of the program, according to HILR director Tess O’Toole ’84.
O’Toole said HILR codified the membership renewal process to both help participants reassess their fit with the program’s needs and encourage opening spaces up for new enrollees. HILR targets 10 percent new participants annually, according to the handbook.
The new handbook specifies that HILR “seeks a diverse group of retired or semi-retired learners committed to rigorous liberal arts study on the peer-learning model.” Participants in the program lead courses and take part in extracurricular activities and guest lectures.
Former HILR Director Leonie J. Gordon, who currently participates in the program, said participants used to have informal check-ins to assess and reflect on their progress in the program.
The new handbook formalizes these discussions and outlines fixed participation periods in the program, the first of which lasts three years. At the conclusion of each participation period, participants must now submit requests for renewal that require them to describe their experience and how they “envisage” their next stage at HILR, according to the handbook.
O’Toole added that the rigor of the program sometimes causes participates to decide that HILR is “more of a commitment” than they might have been prepared to make.
The Division of Continuing Education has also set a target for the program to reduce annual subsidy need from the division from $350,000 to $200,000, according to the handbook.
HILR funding comes from three main sources: a program fee paid by participants, HILR-specific endowment funds established by past donors, and the proceeds of HILR’s Annual Appeal. Tuition revenue covers 66 percent of expenses and the endowment and gift funds cover 34 percent of the expenses of the program. These numbers exclude the annual subsidy, according to the handbook.
O’Toole said that the reduction in subsidies does not amount to a budget cut.
“We have the same budget that we've always had,” O’Toole said.
She added that though HILR has not made any decisions on revenue generating strategies yet, there are “various entryways” to make up for the loss in subsidies that potentially include more fundraising and increasing tuition.
“We haven't had a tuition increase in a long time. At some point, there might have to be a tuition increase… I haven't set out with the community at this point what combination or what calibration of tuition versus development versus additional revenue through programs that happen here,” O’Toole said.
HILR Teaching and Learning Committee Co-Chair Judy P. Uhl, a long-time participant in the program, said HILR is “sort of due for a tuition increase.”
“My guess is that what HILR is going to do is increase the tuition, which with or without this new handbook, people were sort of expecting,” Uhl said.
O’Toole added that there are many participants in the program who are interested in its development in terms of other programs that can help generate revenue.
O’Toole also said the revisions to the handbook offer an opportunity for “everyone [in HILR] to get on the same page,” especially as participants are asked to sign a form that confirms they familiarized themselves with the handbook and understood the structure of the program.
Uhl said HILR always had a handbook, but that very few participants read it.
“You could operate on the basis of ‘whatever used to happen, happens.’ So what Harvard decided to do was to get this handbook that established, ‘What is this place? So, we have a handbook now,’” Uhl said.

Harvard's sexual misconduct climate survey, which is entering its third week, has received a response rate of more than 20 percent — already almost half of the survey’s total response rate in 2015.
The 2019 Survey on Sexual Assault and Misconduct marks the second time the Association of American Universities and Westat have conducted the survey, four years after its first edition in 2015. This year, Harvard is one of 33 institutions participating.
In 2015, Harvard had the highest response rate of any participating institution on the survey, with 53 percent of students filling out the questionnaire. This year, the highest response rate reported so far among participating institutions is 44 percent. More than 2,000 students completed the survey at Harvard the first day, and it closes April 30.
University Title IX Officer Nicole M. Merhill said Harvard took advantage of every opportunity to customize questions for the 2019 survey after hearing feedback on the 2015 iteration. Unlike last time, universities had the opportunity to opt into up to ten free response questions available to all schools, and to insert a small number of unique interspersed questions into the 2019 survey.
Harvard opted into all ten free response options. For the interspersed questions, Merhill said she and her colleagues did their best to take students’ past comments into account. In the University’s recently conducted Pulse survey, for example, some students said they were concerned about questions regarding sexual orientation and gender identity. For the AAU survey, Harvard added a question with more flexible characterizations of gender and sexuality.
“It ended up working out really well,” Merhill said. “I think we got to a better place than the original core question on the survey.”
Harvard also added a question about students’ locations immediately prior to incidents of sexual assault this year, as well as customizations specific to Harvard’s schools and resources.
Overall, roughly 85 percent of the 2019 survey is identical to the 2015 version, allowing the University to compare results from the two.
The 2019 AAU survey comes amidst a variety of surveys sent out in recent months, including the Pulse campus climate survey. Merhill said that unlike Pulse, the AAU survey is administered solely by Westat, an outside firm. In order to ensure total confidentiality, no one at the University can see which students have completed the survey.
“One of the things that we really were very careful about. . .was that anonymity and confidentiality were absolutely essential when disseminating a survey that asked questions about the most sensitive part of a person's life experience,” Merhill said.
Since the 2015 survey, Harvard’s Title IX Office has grown significantly, both in its full-time staff and number of coordinators. Harvard now has 53 coordinators across all its schools. The Office has also rolled out new mandatory trainings for students, faculty, and staff, and developed bystander intervention trainings.
As the survey heads toward its conclusion, the Title IX Office plans to host a short video contest to encourage students to share why participating matters to them. The Office will also continue to promote the survey across the University via tables at the Science Center and posters around campus.

Senior Associate Director of Athletics Patricia Henry will retire June 30, bringing her 40-year tenure to a close, Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise announced in an email to Harvard affiliates Tuesday.
Henry furthered the Athletic Department’s mission of “Education through Athletics and Building Community and Pride in Harvard,” according to Scalise. He added that she was a tireless advocate for Harvard athletes and promoted the department’s philosophy of offering “Athletics for All.”
“She has demonstrated the highest level of integrity and ethics, exercised sound judgement, exhibited respect for others, and embraced the spirit of gender equity in both opportunity for and treatment for all athletes,” he wrote.
Henry established the Harvard Radcliffe Foundation for women’s athletics in 1981, which advanced the programming and financial support of women’s athletics programs, according to Scalise. Her dedication to promoting opportunities for female athletes culminated in her efforts to bring the 2006 NCAA Women’s Basketball Final Four to Boston.
Henry played a key role in the design and construction of the Murr Center, which opened in 1988 and is currently home base for the Athletic Department’s operations.
Scalise wrote in his email that one of the most notable aspects of Henry’s career was her fierce dedication to the wellbeing of Harvard student athletes.
“Pat Henry during her exemplary career has been a strong supporter for student-athlete health and safety,” Brant Berkstresser, the associate director of athletics for student-athlete health and performance, wrote in an email to The Crimson.
The Athletics Department has worked to promote student-athlete health this year, launching a collaboration with Harvard University Health Services’ Counseling and Mental Health Services. The program, entitled Crimson Mind and Body Program, focuses on mental health screening, education, and care through workshops for students and coaches. The initiative debuted at the beginning of fall 2018 in response to survey data collected over several athletic seasons.
Henry was integral to forming these sorts of strong collaborations, according to Berkstresser, who played a role in the creation and development of the Crimson Mind and Body Program.
“Under her guidance, the strong health-care model between the Harvard Athletics Sports Medicine Department and Harvard University Health Services is a model for other collegiate institutions to follow.”
Scalise noted Henry’s work extended well beyond Harvard. She served both on the United States Olympic Women’s Rowing Committee and the United States Olympic Committee Education Council, and she was the co-coordinator of the 1984 Olympic soccer matches held at Harvard Stadium.

Exactly a year ago, student workers at Harvard headed to the polls to vote on whether to unionize. The process — years in the making — resulted in a win for graduate students and College student workers across the University who supported the cause.
Thursday, on its first birthday, Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers will launch an ad campaign on prime-time national television, billboards, and radiowaves criticizing the University’s response to sexual harassment complaints.
In the twelve months since unionization, student workers elected a bargaining committee, released an 80-item list of bargaining goals, and met 24 times with University negotiators. The two sides have gone back and forth since October 2018 on a number of proposals spanning compensation, discrimination grievance procedures, training, and international student rights.
On the anniversary of the union election, The Crimson has broken down the list of tentative, ongoing, and yet-to-be discussed issues on the bargaining table.
Two issues have dominated contract negotiations in recent weeks — grievance procedures for sexual misconduct and discrimination, and economic proposals including compensation and benefits.
The union’s nondiscrimination and sexual harassment proposal, first presented during a bargaining session in October, has been a central point of contention between HGSU and the University.
The union has proposed that members of its bargaining unit — student workers under the union’s representation — should have the option to pursue third party grievance proceedings in addition to Harvard’s own internal resolution mechanisms. In instances of alleged sexual misconduct, Harvard-based options include filing formal complaints through the Office for Dispute Resolution or seeking informal guidance from the University Title IX Office.
The union’s proposed multi-step grievance procedure would give members of the bargaining unit an option to resolve complaints outside of Harvard if they choose, according to HGSU bargaining committee member Rachel J. Sandalow-Ash ’15.
The University has repeatedly rejected the union’s proposal for a third-party grievance procedure. University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain has told The Crimson that the union’s proposal would place complainants and respondents face-to-face in an “adversarial arbitration.”
The union, on the other hand, has argued that arbitration processes leave room for keeping complainants and respondents out of face-to-face confrontations.
“We would ask the arbitrator to keep them separate and arbitrators in these kinds of proceedings do honor those requests to avoid adversarial proceedings,” Sandalow-Ash said.
Swain wrote in an emailed statement that — based on standard practice — cross-examination would be inherent to that “labor arbitration process.”
Sandalow-Ash also said that because investigators in the Office for Dispute Resolution are paid for and accountable to Harvard, they have a conflict of interest in handling these complaints. The union has argued that third-party proceedings could mitigate this concern.
“We find it difficult to accept the view that it is impossible to find unbiased members of the University community who could review an investigation on appeal,” Swain wrote in an emailed statement.
The University’s counterproposal on harassment and discrimination issues would give the union representation on a committee and two working groups to review University’s current policies and procedures on Title IX and “other forms of discrimination and misconduct,” Swain wrote in an earlier statement.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow has also joined the conversation, arguing in an interview last week that a third-party grievance procedure would not be appropriate for sexual harassment complaints because a third-party arbitrator would have no legal authority to discipline anyone outside of HGSU-UAW’s bargaining unit.
Compensation and benefits have also been at the fore during recent bargaining sessions. One month after HGSU put forward its complete set of economic proposals, the University responded with its counter proposals Monday, according to an email University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 sent to Harvard affiliates Tuesday.
The University’s proposal would raise the University-wide hourly minimum wage to $15, a figure slightly higher than the $14.85 living wage in Boston and Cambridge areas, according to Swain. He also wrote that Harvard’s broader proposal is in line with other contracts negotiated by United Automobile Workers — HGSU’s international parent union — at other universities.
The union, however, characterized the University’s compensation proposal as a “pay decrease” in a bargaining update sent to its members Tuesday. In the update, it wrote that the plan would give a pay raise smaller than that in any three-year period during the last decade, and would “barely” keep up with the cost of living.
The union’s economic proposals would double the University’s expenditures for each graduate student at Harvard, Garber wrote in his email.
HGSU also slammed Harvard’s proposals on benefits, which Union bargaining committee member Ashley B. Gripper wrote in an earlier statement that Harvard’s child care fund would “barely make a dent” in covering student workers’ costs.
Swain wrote that Harvard’s proposal includes a child care fund, emergency grants, and a healthcare coverage fund available to dependents.
Harvard and HGSU have reached a consensus on four contract provisions.
The two first agreed on severability and union recognition at a bargaining session Nov. 9, according to Swain. These establish who is counted in the bargaining unit and protect the contract as a whole in the case that a single provision was ever deemed illegal.
A tentative agreement on employment records made at a Jan. 23 session will allow teaching fellows to view course evaluations written about them, and petition Harvard to remove evaluations that are “horribly inaccurate” or “discriminatory,” according to a video posted on HGSU’s Instagram Jan. 25.
In that video, the union said the two sides also agreed to increase access to professional development resources and training for student workers, and that the University would compensate them for attending training sessions.
After repeated calls from HGSU for increased bargaining time with University negotiators, the two sides agreed to form four subcommittees to fine-tune specific proposals outside regular bargaining sessions.
In a bargaining update from April 1, the union identified five areas — equity and inclusivity, job security and transparency, healthy work environment, international student workers protections, and union recognition and rights — as areas where they have made some progress.
HGSU has repeatedly stated a goal of securing a contract that will take effect this fall.
Swain wrote that the University and the union have set dates for bargaining sessions up to June, but that contract negotiations at other universities have taken anywhere from one year to 18 months.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Kieran Shaw toed the rubber in the bottom of the ninth inning at Fenway Park, Harvard baseball seemed poised to make history. With the Crimson holding a narrow 9-8 lead over UMass in a nail-biting game, Shaw was three outs from securing both the Crimson’s first ever back-to-back Beanpot titles and the single-season record for most saves by an Ivy League pitcher.
But in a heartbreakingly cruel twist of fate, the Minutemen stormed back in the bottom of the ninth inning to win 10-9. The bottom of the ninth began with a ringing double into the left field corner, and a costly wild pitch moved the runner to third, bringing the infield in. A chopper that might have otherwise been fielded made it through the drawn-in infield, scoring one and tying the game at nine runs apiece.
With their backs against the walls, Harvard faltered, despite playing sparkling defense all night. The defense failed to record an out on an attempted sacrifice bunt that bizarrely deflected off of catcher Matt Thomas’ mask, setting the stage for a successful sacrifice on the next at bat. After an intentional walk to load the bases and set up a potential force out at the plate or a double-play, pinch-hitter Logan Greene hit a walk-off fly ball to center field.
The Crimson (18-9, 8-4 Ivy) sought to repeat as Beanpot Champions for the first time in program history, but were ultimately doomed by ineffective pitching throughout the ballgame. Without a formal starter, Coach Bill Decker was forced to go to eight different relievers, and was ultimately unable to find the right combination to defeat UMass (11-18, 5-7 Atlantic-10).
Harvard turned to many of the bullpen arms to take the mound in tonight’s contest, not wanting to disrupt the rotation for Ivy League play this coming weekend. Sophomore Enzo Stefanoni made his 11th appearance on the bump for the Crimson in what was his first start of the season.
If there were any early nerves for Darien, Conn., native, they didn’t show, as he struck out the first batter he faced, Minutemen leadoff man Collin Shapiro. Stefanoni added another strikeout as he sat down cleanup hitter Anthony Videtto to finish out a clean first frame.
With solid defensive play from junior shortstop Chad Minato, Stefanoni was also able to emerge from the second inning unscathed. The third inning, though, was not as kind to the product of Rye Country Day, as he allowed four consecutive base hits, cutting the Crimson lead to one run. While two of the hits were of the infield variety, the others were smashed into the right-center field gap for extra bases.
The next to enter the fray for Harvard was senior Jake Forte. Forte, one of the most unique stories on the team, transitioned this season from the field to the mound, featuring an unconventional three-quarters delivery. He had some trouble with command, though, and hit two batters in his second inning of work, loading the bases and bringing freshman Harrison Stovern out to the mound from the pen.
With a full count and facing the cleanup hitter, Stovern painted the inside corner with a fastball for a called strike three — controlling the damage and ending the inning. This clutch strikeout set the stage for a four-run fifth inning that gave Harvard a lead it would only cede in the bottom of the ninth.
The bullpen’s struggles overshadowed what was an otherwise standout performance from an offensive perfective, for both Harvard and UMass. Tonight’s contest was a slugfest compared to the Crimson’s semifinal matchup against Northeastern, a game in which there were just seven runs and three hits recorded by the two teams combined. When the dust had settled at the Fens, the two teams today had combined for a whopping 29 hits and 19 runs.
Harvard’s offensive tear started with two outs in the top of the first inning, when senior first baseman Patrick McColl wrapped a solo home run past the Pesky Pole in right field, channeling the spirit of David Ortiz and other Red Sox greats. McColl’s drive was the latest in a series of clutch offensive contributions this season that has helped the Crimson to second place in the Ancient Eight standings. The senior added an RBI single in the sixth to extend the lead to 8-5.
The power surge continued into the top of the second as freshman Logan Bravo realized a dream of many ball-players can only hope to achieve. He hammered a two-run shot over the Green Monster, putting Harvard up 3-0. That blast made this the second straight Beanpot championship with a Crimson homer over the Monster, as then-freshman infielder Quinn Hoffman did the same just two years ago.
Bravo rung a double off of the top of the Monster in the top of the seventh inning, to help extend the Harvard lead to four runs. His 2-for-4 performance, including a pair of extra-base hits and three RBI’s, was critical out of the No. 8 spot in the lineup.
UMass relief pitcher Brad Collins struggled to get through the middle of the order in the fifth inning, and was hurt greatly by a series of defensive errors that resulted in four total runs, three of which were unearned.
The turning point in the top of the fifth came with the bases loaded and one out, when catcher Deven Peterson hit a hard ground ball towards second baseman Eddy Hart, a picture perfect double play ball. Instead of causing a double play to end the inning, the grounder skipped through Hart’s legs, allowing an additional two runs to score.
The Minutemen would not go down without a fight, however, as a three-run seventh inning cut the Crimson lead to just one run. While Harvard mounted a rally in the top of this deliberate frame, UMass responded with a hit parade of their own. Coach Decker was forced to use three pitchers to record three outs, with the inning mercifully ending with Harvard still in front, if only for another inning.
The seventh inning expended many of Coach Decker’s high-leverage relievers, forcing Shaw to enter an inning earlier than Coach Decker might have otherwise wanted. The Los Gatos, Calif., native had previously recorded a two-inning save, but might have fatigued slightly over the taxing 36-pitch performance.
Wednesday’s game moved at a pace usually reserved for Fenway’s more frequently attended draws between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox. With a first pitch at 6:03pm, the contest lasted well over four hours, ironically overlapping with a matchup played at Yankee Stadium between the two Major League Baseball foes.
When the final pitch had been thrown, Harvard was left rueing its opportunity to close out the game, and must turn its attention to qualifying for the Ivy League Championship series, one of the only consolations that might ease the memory of tonight’s Beanpot Championship.

As college students, assignments are constantly on our minds and schedules. While we all have the rare classes that give us some nice, simple assignments (thanks Ancient Greek Hero!), many professors and teaching fellows hand out grueling assignments that seem wholly unfair. There are some things that just shouldn’t be done when assigning work.
Single-Spaced Papers
Imagine this — you’ve gone into a class prepared for the 5-10 page papers listed on the syllabus. You’re feeling good, ready to start writing, until you hear the worst words in the English language: single-spaced. Single-spaced papers defeat the point of giving the page limit ahead of time, since the amount of writing doubles. It’s ridiculous: Double-spaced papers are much easier to read, and students are used to calculating how long they will take to write. Single-spaced papers help no one in this process, and are simply a painful trick to make it seem like your assignments are shorter than they actually are.
Multi-Part Questions
Again, we’ve all been here. Your TF has apparently blessed you with a shorter pset — only 3 questions this week! Then, you open up your pset and are hit with it: parts a-j on problem 1, parts a-h on problem 2, and parts a-o on problem 3. Why? This trick done by teaching staff is just cruel, and it’s worse than just making each part its own question. And for the love of all that is holy, please don’t even consider adding subparts to the subparts of problems.
Assignments Due on Exam Day
You know what students don’t have time for when they are studying for an exam worth 40 percent of their overall grade? Doing a pset for the same class. Such assignments are the trademark of the quintessential self-important professor, thinking their class is always a top priority. The rudeness only increases if the pset is on material not on the pressing midterm, or the pset is harder and longer than usual.
While we have built up a tolerance to lots of the shenanigans pulled on assignments, there are certain things that clearly cross a line. If you have a TF or professor that does these things, just tell them, “dude, that’s rude.”
