After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some people spend their time painting elaborate portraits in studios, writing meters of circular prose, playing in bands, or practicing their dance steps. What Tyler G. Hall ’11 does is equally as important: he spends his time making people laugh.
One of Harvard’s most prolific screenwriters, Hall has had a hand in the production of On Harvard Time (OHT), Hasty Pudding Theatricals (HPT), and most recently “Sphinx,” a sketch comedy show. But Hall has not always been a writer. He first joined OHT as a tech worker. “I worked on design, sound, and built the desk that is still in there today,” says Hall. Only after OHT started to push members to write did he try his hand at comedic writing. “It’s a very democratizing process. Kids can have their stuff made right away and not have to jump through any hoops to do it,” says Hall. His role with OHT began to expand as time progressed, and he eventually became the show’s executive producer.
Those who know Hall best can see the impact that he’s had on the show. “He basically made On Harvard Time what it is today and it has probably been one of the biggest contributions to the Harvard art scene in the past four years,” says Hall’s roommate Johnny F. Bowman ’11.
Hall also sits on the board for HPT. Every year, the group performs a student-written drag burlesque musical, which travels to New York and Bermuda over spring break. Much like his start with OHT, Hall originally joined the Theatricals to do tech work and gradually expanded his role in the group. Unlike OHT, however, the Hasty Pudding’s shows are less about commentary and more about simply being silly and absurd—qualities that Hall finds refreshing. “The cast works so hard, only for the simple purpose of making people laugh. People love this thing because there’s no pretension; it’s all for ridiculousness,” says Hall. This dynamic is also present in Hall’s demeanor. “He always maintains this relaxed, funny mood. He’s never too serious, but in the best possible way,” says Christopher C. Liberge ’12, one of the co-anchors of OHT.
Most recently, Hall directed “Sphinx,” a sketch comedy show that premiered on April 23 and the first project of its kind that he has directed. “I was really impressed by his ability to make things that he writes on paper funny on stage,” says Zack E. Wortman ’14, who both performed in Sphinx and contributed to its writing.
Writing a comedy sketch of any kind is by no means easy. Hall explains that comedy is a different from other forms of artistic expression in that a person can tell if it is done right or if it is done wrong—the audience either laughs or it doesn’t. “Comedy writing is definitely one of the cooler art forms in this way because you can learn from your mistakes,” notes Hall.
While comedy may seem frivolous by nature, it is an essential facet of life here at the College, where productions like HPT have become so closely associated with the Harvard name. Additionally, laughter can often be the best solution to the troubles that plague Harvard students. “I don’t think a ton of people appreciate what a great outlet it is. Especially here where life can get so stressful and where there’s no shortage of anxiety, it’s great that there’s someone like Tyler who can diffuse all that tension,” says Noah A. Hoch ’11, who has worked with Hall on both OHT and Sphinx. Hall’s talent and dedication to his craft have shaped Harvard’s comedic community. Says Hoch, “You know how they say great things come in little packages? Well Tyler is like that. Except for the little package part.”

Daniel J. Thorn ’11 loves music. He knows it, and his friends and colleagues know it. In addition to coming off a year-long stint as the General Manager of student-run Harvard Radio Broadcasting (WHRB), Thorn also has a hand in creating his own music, as well as crafting playlists on his weekly radio show.
Thorn is a member of not just one, but two separate bands—The Sinister Turns and the more recently formed Hedge Fund. Thorn says he was quick to ally himself with like-minded musicians almost as soon as he arrived on-campus. “I’ve been [making music] all the time I’ve been at school. I joined my first band in October of freshman year,” he says. “I enjoy working with other musicians on campus—by far some of the most interesting people I’ve met here.”
“He’s definitely a big creative force in the band,” says Jacob N. Augenstern ’10, the vocalist for Hedge Fund. “He’s a very talented guitarist, and he just has this knack for taking things he hears and mixing them together to make some really great riffs.” In addition to the countless hours Thorn spends composing guitar and bass parts, he also has the prowess to work the recording equipment in the newly opened Student Organization Center at Hilles (SOCH) recording studio. “His knowledge about music equipment both playing and recording is kind of ridiculous,” says Augenstern.
Besides composing and performing, Thorn has spent much of his time at Harvard serving the radio station, hosting shows for various departments and running the gamut from jazz to The Darker Side of hip hop to Record Hospital’s punk rock maladies.
Parker M. Crane ’13, who spent last summer working in sales for WHRB, recalls Thorn’s jack-of-all-trades persona. “He knows all the ins and outs of the station so it was pretty valuable having him around,” Crane says. “Despite having never been in sales, he somehow knew all the stuff I had to do, so it was incredibly helpful.”
In addition, Crane is quick to mention Dan’s vast love for all kinds of music. When discussing different bands and their influences, Crane recalls Thorn pulling out all manner of factoids and obscure influences for any band one could think of. “I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone with an encyclopedic knowledge of music like Dan’s. I can see him being a fantastic music writer.”
For Thorn, music not only brings students together on campus, but presents an opportunity to explore outside the gates of Harvard Yard. After graduation, he plans to stay in Boston and continue honing his craft. “Right now, my plans are just to keep recording and making music in Boston for the next year,” he says, optimistic about the myriad of opportunities. “I’m looking forward to it a lot. Boston’s a great place to be if you’re into DJing and electronic music and the punk rock scene.”
Despite being skilled in nearly every aspect of music composition and production, however, Thorn has not let that get to his head. “He’s just one of the friendliest people I’ve probably ever met … He’s driven and knowledgeable yet humble,” says Augenstern.

“Every text, every document, every book, all that is composed of words, is made of sand or, better yet, of water. Nothing is less constant than words, yet nothing lasts as long as words do, and in that paradox lie the beginning and the end of all writing, and every human effort.” So writes the narrator in Serbian author David Albahari’s latest novel “Leeches,” translated by Ellen Elias-Bursac.
The novel is ostensibly an account of one young man’s efforts to unravel an ethnopolitical conspiracy developing beneath the tense surface of life in Belgrade under the rule of Slobodan Milosevic in 1998. Intrigued by one violent slap on the bank of the Danube, the alternately superstitious and skeptical protagonist begins to obsess over mysterious signs and black-clad figures that lurk in the corners of his experience. He soon embroils himself in a Kabbalistic plot to free the Jewish community from violence and marginalization. Although he himself is not Jewish, his involvement in the scheme spurs a series of progressively more violent and repulsive anti-Semitic hate crimes. Yet despite his submergence in the details of local Jewish history and the intricacies of mystic belief, the narrative of the young man—who works as a columnist for the weekly journal Minut—seems to transcend its association with a particular spatiotemporal point in history. “Leeches” emerges from its entanglement with Serbian politics as a powerful postmodernist struggle with the impotence and emptiness of language.
In a self-consciously heavy-handed yet surprisingly effective attempt at realism, Albahari’s novel at once avoids all literary tropes: the narrative lacks introductory descriptions, metaphors, and even lucid structure. Presented without a single paragraph break, the story seems almost like a stream of consciousness with a better sense of direction: the narrator recounts each mystifying symbol he encounters in great detail and with nagging doubt that any one of them really means anything. His everyday cognitive meanderings gel events together, and transitions from piece to piece are quite impressively seamless.
This structure, if it can be called that, also allows the protagonist to voice various endearing and comical reactions to the increasingly confusing world he inhabits. Of a piece of hate mail made up of newspaper letters, he writes, “it was long, and I felt a begrudging admiration for the person willing to spend so many hours with all that finicky cutting and pasting, probably while wearing plastic gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints on the scissors, glue tube, and newspapers.” His straightforward yet inquisitive voice, paired with the down-to-earth yet eerily apt remonstrations of his best friend Marko—who insists that he “had dropped acid and tripped”—make for quite an enjoyable read. This amusing interplay turns out to be not so much a boon as a real necessity, once we realize that our poor protagonist will not even approach the truth behind the symbols for hundreds of pages.
As the plot develops further, however, the naïve realism of the narrative is gradually supplanted by musings on the powerlessness of symbolic language. It is no accident that the scheme the narrator eventually discovers revolves around an old Kabbalistic manuscript meant to provide directions for summoning divine forces of protection in times of need. The plan is steeped in a rich mystic tradition that gradually opens itself up for interpretation. Various numbers, figures, and names begin to take on a vague but pressing significance in the narrator’s mind. Yet each new connection drawn fails to illuminate his situation further; his paths of investigation seem repeatedly to lead to dead ends. At the same time, engulfed as he is by tracking down the meanings of various signs and symbols, his own writing in Minut turns towards a focus on the terrible condition of the Jewish population in Belgrade and his neighboring home town, Zemun. The only response he receives is in the form of hate mail and threats. He opens his door one day to find that someone has defecated on his doormat; on another occasion, he finds the remains of a massacred cat lying in a bag.
It seems natural, then, that the narrator should bemoan the condition of the written word and our ability to understand it. “No one can convince me that real life is as orderly as a novel, and that in real life everything is tidy and purposeful,” he insists. He even incorporates subtle jabs at his own style: he hears, for instance, that “writing in brief, a subject swiftly plumbed, represents the pinnacle of writing, such as what the celestial beings practice, while writing in longer fragments is a trustworthy sign of a text’s inferiority.” His narrative is marred by self-conscious nods to its own construction; he regrets choices of verbiage, expresses his desire for the text to be burnt after his death, and even insists that he “never meant to write a book.” His uncertainty about his own use of language begins to mirror his uncertainty about how to synthesize the signs he encounters into one meaningful picture, and what emerges is a strong statement about the futility of the symbol.
Thus, from a web of confusions arises a clear conclusion about the limitations of language. It is refreshing and surprising to find such a cerebral theme couched in such nakedly straightforward prose, especially given that Albahari’s construction of suspense—if long-winded—turns out to be quite exciting in and of itself. Where the narrator’s own investigations into the intricate world of Kaballah may feel, by their end, to have been pointless, it is in this very pointlessness that they find their power: they are symbols, at least, of the impotence of symbols themselves. The “book of sand” still holds some weight.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Michael A. Yashinsky ’11 is listening to actors read his one-act play “If Plums Grew on a Thistle” for the first time. It is several hours before the same actors will read Yashinsky’s play before an audience at the Arts First-sponsored Harvard Playwrights’ Festival, the four-day culminating event of English Lecturer Christine M. Evan’s class English Cakr: “Advanced Playwriting.”
The actor playing protagonist Simon is deftly narrating Simon’s bizarre tale of his upbringing, during which he swallowed a peach pit and developed a deep and mostly platonic love for fruit. Yashinsky watches keenly. He puts his pen to his own copy of the script and begins to make notes on a page already covered in green ink.
“Hearing it, it made me think that those lines were far too long and being far too explicit,” Yashinsky, also an inactive Crimson arts editor, said after the reading. “I plan to go back and just … trim. Cut back on a lot of these long lines that I think would be more effective briefer.” Yashinsky has been working on this play for the duration of the semester, but he sees now that his writing process is far from over.
The performances that come from student playwriting, then, tend to receive creative influence from the other artists who help to realize a play.  The playwright often continuously revises the work as it moves closer to production on stage, to ensure that the story translates well to a theatrical production and to incorporate ideas from others who are working on a play. The key to expanding a play’s interpretive possibilities and refining its central elements can come from these revisions and collaborations.
SURPASSING SPEECH
A play bound for production often undergoes constant revision up until or even past the show’s opening as the playwright attempts to navigate the artistic maze of translating his or her story on paper into a performance onstage. “That’s one of the primary characteristics of a play—it’s a recipe for a performance that exists outside of the play,” says English Lecturer and playwright Ken Urban. “Ultimately, even if you’ve got the best-written play and it doesn’t work on stage, it’s not really a good play, because plays have to work in three-dimensional space, in real time, on a stage.” For the playwright, this imperative involves exploring the opportunities performance offers.
Table readings like those at the festival prompt revisions primarily by revealing how dialogue will sound coming from an actor. In the writing process, playwrights must ensure that every important aspect of each character be communicated through speech. “The playwright understands the character so intimately that they think certain important details about the character are in the play when, in fact, they’re not,” Urban says. Actors’ and directors’ interpretations isolate the aspects of every character, a process that helps playwrights identify what was not successfully communicated in their work. “That’s why most writers do revisions after they hear a play out loud,” Urban says.
Staging often spurs further revisions by helping playwrights visualize the opportunities that theater presents as a medium, such as space, motion, and scenery. Exposure to these non-verbal elements can make playwrights reconsider the centrality of dialogue and use more of these subtler methods. Urban affirms that a grasp of the visual can stand in for dialogue heavily burdened with characterization. “I’ve noticed directors say, ‘I don’t think I understand this character,’ but that’s because they’ve only heard that character speaking,” he says. “They haven’t seen the motions and the actions associated with that character in three-dimensional space.” Playwrights are then forced to acknowledge playwriting’s limitations while learning to take advantage of the possibilities presented by performance.
FOUND SYMPATHY
But a play’s journey to the stage is more than a matter of fitting the story to the theater medium. It comes largely in readings or staging, when actors and directors sometimes interpret characters in intriguing ways the playwright hadn’t originally intended. At Yashinsky’s reading, professional director Adam Greenfield and actors at the festival found sympathy in a character Yashinsky had considered a one-sided antagonist. “I’m thinking of going back to that character and making him even richer—fleshing out the character,” Yashinsky says. “They actually found [that sympathy] in the text as it is now, but I’d like to bring it out even
richer—fleshing out the character,” Yashinsky says. “They actually found [that sympathy] in the text as it is now, but I’d like to bring it out even more.” Yashinsky’s reaction to actors’ interpretations exemplifies an open-minded principle held by playwrights: that no one—not even the writer—has exclusive right to the interpretation of his or her own piece.
Actors can even have valuable insights about a play’s characters that a student playwright may never have realized. Andy J. Boyd ’14, whose original play “Zirn Sees the Specks of Light” ran recently at the Adams Pool Theatre, attributes the playwright’s distance from some characters to numbers: “I definitely try to get in that mindset for each character as much as possible, but that’s hard to do when you, as the writer, have to write a scene with multiple characters,” he says. The actor may inflect the character with a different energy or shift the role between drama and comedy.
At other times, however, revision is spurred when actors forget their lines and instinctive knowledge of character kicks in. Boyd recalls a scene in “Zirn” in which one panicked character shoots another in the head and then stands, flustered, gripping his beefy shotgun, over his accidental victim. “…Darn!” he says at last—not the line Boyd originally wrote, but the line Terrence B. McKenna III ’14 said in performance. “It was just such a wonderful understatement that I decided to keep it,” Boyd says. “That’s one of the really amazing things about theater—there’s a wonderful give-and-take between the writer and the actor.” Like the spatial opportunities of the stage, these fortuitous slips in memory—unique to stage acting, when an actor has no script to read from—indicate that some elements of a play may be best understood outside of the solitary moment of writing. “I don’t know how I could not change a play during the rehearsal progress,” Boyd adds.
PRIOR PRIORITIES
Many playwrights cross over to writing after or alongside work in other aspects of theater, like acting or directing. Though these playwrights come to the medium with intimate knowledge of another theatrical form, they still rely on others to perfect their plays.
Playwrights from other disciplines have a greater intuitive grasp on the formal requirements and possibilities of theater as a medium, and thus the translation of their stories into dialogue and movement can be much smoother. “I’ve never come to playwriting as an actor, but I’ve always been jealous of those who have,” Urban says. In his experience, actors’ familiarity with scene pacing and the structure of character interactions helps them to write scenes that flow in real time and maintain dramatic tension. “And if you’re a director, you imagine plays existing in three-dimensional space, so you can imagine one of your own,” Urban says.
This prior knowledge has limited use, however: much of what a playwright gains from collaboration comes simply from the basics of collaboration. Experience in another discipline will not help a playwright detect any gaps between what is on paper and what is in their head. “When you have that dialogue internally, it doesn’t work,” Urban says. Other people can bring out unexplored elements, alternate interpretations, and  new ideas entirely.
RITES OF REVISION
While a play benefits massively from the revision process it undergoes from each reading or staging, Urban emphasizes that the process never really ends. He tells the story of Tony Kushner, who won the Pulitzer Prize in 1993 for his play “Angels in America”—but then revised the play’s second half for a revival in 2010. “And you know what?” Urban says. “It was better. If Kushner can win every single major award and still revise his play for a revival, then I would say there’s no reason any playwright should stop revising.”
New logistical setups—new stages, new budgets, new actors with different tones of voice—inevitably alter a play every time it is staged. Looking to the reevaluations Urban has in mind, the deeply collaborative nature of theater—and particularly some playwrights’ sense that no one, themselves included, possesses a uniquely “right” interpretation of characters or events—is likely a part of what propels this drive to revise continually.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The debate surrounding embattled professor Marc D. Hauser lives on. The psychology professor, after a three-year-long investigation by the University, was found “solely responsible” for multiple counts of scientific misconduct last August, prompting his announcement of a year-long leave. As the controversy simmered in his absence, the future of Hauser’s status at the University remained uncertain. A degree of clarity and controversy came with the psychology department’s recent declaration that Hauser would indeed return to Harvard—but only to the lab, not the lecture hall.
In light of the unambiguous results of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’s internal investigation, the psychology department should have gone further in its decision.  Simply put, Hauser should be fired. If the University truly values its policies on academic integrity in practice rather than name, it should dismiss all community members who fail to uphold those standards, from undergraduates to tenured professors.
For a bizarre and unjustifiable set of reasons, Harvard seems to have a historical aversion to dismissing tenured faculty in any circumstance.  In fact—as FAS spokesman Jeff Neal told The Crimson last fall—FAS has never begun dismissal proceedings against a faculty member because of research misconduct. However, several incidents from the past two decades show that in such situations, junior Harvard faculty have resigned from their positions when tenured faculty have somehow managed to keep their jobs.
In 2004, for instance, when a federal court found economics professor Andrei Shleifer liable for conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government while leading a Harvard economic reform program in Russia, the University not only refused to fire Shleifer, but it also went  so far as to pay $26.5 million to settle a government lawsuit against him. Similarly, in 1988, when Shervert H. Frazier, then-head of the Harvard Medical School psychiatry department and the Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital, was ultimately rehired by McLean Hospital after no fewer than four counts of plagiarism. The experience of junior faculty members in similar situations, on the other hand, could not be more different: Lee S. Simon, Ali A. Sultan, and Weishui Y. Weiser have all resigned in recent years after charges of academic dishonesty, never to be re-hired.
The University should use the Hauser case to declare an end to the treatment of tenure as tantamount to faculty immunity. After all, peer institutions like Yale and Columbia have fired tenured faculty members for academic misconduct, and, as the Education School’s Cathy A. Trower told The Crimson during the eruption of the Hauser scandal this past fall, a 1994 study found that between 50 and 75 tenured professors are dismissed annually nationwide.
Why is Harvard so reluctant to do the same?
As any academic community should, Harvard mandates a certain code of conduct among its members. In turn, that code governs the University’s intellectual vitality and ensures its longevity. Refusing to hold any member of the community accountable—even the most highly esteemed—only sends the message that academic integrity is a suggestion rather than a requirement and an aspiration rather than a reality. Frankly, that’s a message far too dangerous for a research university as prestigious and as well-respected as Harvard to send to its affiliates and to the world.
Firing Marc Hauser—and, in the future, any other tenured professors who commit academic misconduct—would thus be anything but an embarrassment. If anything, it would affirm that Harvard is truly the community it purports itself to be. Above all else, as embarrassed as we are that that tenure at Harvard seems to entail exemption from academic integrity, it is high time that the Harvard Corporation break with tradition and dismiss Hauser for the “grave misconduct or neglect of duty” he committed.
Correction: April 27, 2011
An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to the name of a Harvard professor found liable of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government. He is Andrei Shleifer, not Andrei Schleifer.

Of the many things I’ve learned during my freshman year, there is one important lesson that stands out: Don’t bring a laptop to class. Despite the fact that laptops can be used for greater efficiency in taking notes, their use undermines the academic process, rather than helping it.
At my high school, taking notes by hand was mostly encouraged. Seeing an open laptop in class was rare, even frowned upon. You can imagine my surprise at one of my first college lectures—as the Professor started to speak, I was distracted by the sudden buzzing behind me of open laptops and hundreds of flying hands typing the lecturer’s words. I looked up from my notebook, feeling a rush of inadequacy with my retro pen and open notebook. I was sure that I would fall behind.
And yet, over the course of this year, I have learned that my initial sense of respect for fellow students’ dedication and speed at note- taking was misdirected. Instead of serving as a fantastic and efficient way to keep up with the teachers’ words laptops are a source of distraction and scattered thinking.
Instead of listening attentively to the lecturer, I find that most students—myself included—type out words without really taking anything in when using laptops in class. A moment of boredom or a pause in discussion is enough to find wonderful sources of cyber entertainment, just a few easy clicks away: Facebook albums! Tweets! Blog posts! When we try to resurface to focus on the lesson again, however, our minds are so fried with colliding pixels that our real engagement is lost. We begin typing again, but like disconnected zombies.
The problem is that we never run out of things to do on our laptops. Students can be entertained for hours in class without ever listening to a word of what the teacher is saying. I fondly remember one class in particular where, instead of listening to the subject at hand, I watched a fellow student Googling away next to me such pressing matters as “How to make Toffee.” Although toffee-making may have been of extreme importance, her focus on that subject rather than on the class material made it evident that none of what was being taught was sinking in.
One could easily argue that students have always found ways to distract themselves in class by doodling, passing notes, or taking a nap or two. But the difference here is that the world of cyberspace is limitless. You can only doodle for so long, but the Internet holds infinite distractions, infinite daydreams, and infinite numbers of scandalous Facebook albums to peruse. It never ends, and it is tempting to be sucked in, colonized, and transported, never to resurface until the end of class.
Admittedly, it can initially be intimidating to try and keep up in class with just a pen and paper while nearly everyone else is typing. But writing one’s notes by hand actually makes one realize what material is important and what is disposable. Typing notes makes it easy to take down everything professors say without filtering their words down to what is crucial. When we have less time to write everything down, we make better judgments on what material is expendable and what is not.
I have learned to leave my computer in my room for class, and I would encourage others to do the same. It is difficult, and there will be relapses. But in the end, it is beneficial for our education and more respectful towards the professors who put so much time into our course material.

In recent years, Western media and scholarship have been ablaze with criticism of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) oppressive ruling tactics, particularly of religious organizations. Unfortunately, much of this Western analysis fails to contextualize the CCP’s behavior—the current reporting is ahistorical to a fault.
The AP reported this week that the Beijing authorities detained “illegal church members” on Easter as part of a widespread clampdown on unregistered religious organizations that “could challenge Communist authority.” While this is all true, it leaves most readers with the mistaken impression that Communism is responsible for the periodic crackdowns, government manipulation, and general harassment religions in China face. Last month, The Huffington Post’s Michael Levy confused the issue even further by blaming the CCP-written Chinese Constitution for advocating state meddling in spiritual affairs. On the prominent religious-issues website religioustolerance.org, the entry about religious intolerance in China begins: “The Chinese government has relentlessly suppressed religious groups since achieving power in 1949.”
To blame the anti-religious stance of the Chinese ruling class on Communism, however, is simply to ignore history. The Nationalist government (1928-1949) had many similarities with its Communist successor. Chinese historian Rebecca Nedostup’s recent book, Superstitious Regimes, details the Nationalist government’s brutal campaigns against “superstition” and various “religious institutions” during the Nanjing Decade (1928-1937).” Just as an example, Buddhist and Daoist temples were shut down while monks were attacked for being “unproductive” members of society. The monk lifestyle was widely seen as economic exploitation of gullible peasants and a sign of national “backwardness.”
Even before the Nationalists came to power, mainstream Chinese elites were strongly anti-religious. Religion scholar Wing-tsit Chan writes that this anti-religious wave reached a “climax in 1922 in the activities of the Great Federation of Anti-Religionists.” The “Great Federation denounced religion as poison” and mobilized anti-religious protests by students and professors in Shanghai and Beijing. Most of these anti-religionists were not Communists. As we can see, much of China’s ruling class has viewed religion as inherently threatening to state power for at least a century. Some scholars would argue for longer.
None of this history is groundbreaking for China scholars, but I certainly raise eyebrows among my classmates (including the Chinese ones) by suggesting Communism is not the source of all of the Chinese state’s ills. Given the constant stream of negative articles about the CCP’s brutality in the past few years, it is not hard to see why this is the prevailing view. Instead of teaching readers something new about Chinese society, news articles about religion in China hammer in misperceptions. People tend not to remember the details of how many Christians were arrested in which province and for what reason; all that sticks is the misleading notion that Communism is continuing its assault on religion in China.
The ideological source of this anti-religious stance is not Communism, but the modernizing drives of the early 1900s. Elites expressed deep-seated dissatisfaction with the faltering Qing Dynasty’s response to encroaching imperial powers and demanded fundamental change. While some of the early 1900s modernizers and reformers were Communists, others identified with Nationalism, Confucianism, or something else entirely. What they shared was the belief that Chinese society had to be ideologically and spiritually revolutionized to compete with Western powers. It was this intellectual impulse toward modernization that consolidated into the anti-religious stance of the 1920s.
I understand, of course, that every New York Times article cannot have a 700-word op-ed at the bottom explaining how readers should historicize the CCP’s violent tactics. Much more, however, can be done. I think that a great journalist not only reports the news, but also strives to identify and challenge misperceptions the public has about the world. This mission is doubly important for issues of intercultural understanding where one society is understood through the culturally-tinted lens of the other’s media. This is not a defense of the Chinese Communists, but a plea that we understand why they behave the way they do.
Chris J. Carothers’11 is a Social Studies concentrator in Eliot House. He wrote his thesis on religion in China.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few weeks ago, some of my friends went barefoot for a day. Intrigued, I asked why, and learned that they were participating in “One Day Without Shoes” to raise awareness of the difficulties faced by children who go barefoot every day. This was how I became interested in TOMS Shoes, a for-profit company that sponsors this annual event.
TOMS is well known for its one-for-one business model: For every pair of shoes it sells, the company donates a pair of shoes to a child in need. At first, I thought this sounded like a great way to leverage business to help communities. But a skeptical friend prodded me to think more carefully about the impact TOMS—and other companies with similar business models—are making. By giving free shoes to impoverished populations, she pointed out, TOMS competes with local businesses and takes away customers that might otherwise buy locally made shoes.
Apparently, this isn’t uncommon in philanthropy. Several acknowledged instances can be found where in-kind donations have disrupted local markets in developing countries. A 2008 study found that used-clothing imports to Africa explained 50 percent of the fall in employment in that sector from 1981-2000. After the Haiti earthquake, an influx of foreign food aid—particularly donations of rice—hurt rice farmers’ livelihoods. Oxfam has also found that secondhand clothing imports to nations like Senegal and Ghana have likely hurt local industries and contributed to unemployment. The Oxfam report quotes the General Secretary of the International Textile, Garment and Leather Workers’ Federation on the job losses: “Unable to compete [with secondhand clothing imports], local businesses are collapsing, leaving hundreds of thousands of workers jobless.”
Although TOMS likely has good intentions, its donation strategy may negatively impact the communities it seeks to support. Like the litany of organizations that donate shoes, clothes, and other items to developing countries, TOMS may be undermining the development of local businesses. And while making in-kind donations benefits consumers in the short run, stifling local industry and increasing unemployment in this way will intensify poverty in the long-term.
Another issue with organizations like TOMS is that donating shoes can be financially inefficient. Shoes are typically inexpensive in developing nations—in Mumbai, as in Port-au-Prince, one pair is sold for as little as $2. Shipping a used pair of shoes often costs more; for instance, Soles4Soles solicits donations of $3-$5 to ship a pair of shoes to Haiti. In addition to hurting local business, in-kind donations sometimes simply waste money. We could actually save money and simultaneously help stimulate local economies by just keeping our old shoes and instead buying new ones from community-based vendors.
It is critical that we consider these types of unintended consequences of charitable giving. By pinpointing these problems, we can determine more effective ways of helping communities in need. For instance, TOMS might do better to alter its business model. As one blogger suggests, “Instead of donating a pair of shoes for each pair purchased, take the cash equivalent of that donation (the production cost of the shoe plus the shipping/handling/storage/distribution costs) and instead sink that into local shoe manufacture.” Rather than providing imported handouts, TOMS could partner with local shoe producers to provide low-cost or free shoes to children in need. In doing so, it could support local entrepreneurship and still fulfill its mission of helping children who would otherwise go barefoot.
As consumers of “socially conscious” products, we need to be aware of the impact of our purchases. In a culture where giving back through consumption is increasingly popular, and where myriad companies market items that purportedly help those in need, we should be cautious and deliberate about how we choose to support international development. In some cases, what at first seems like a good business idea could turn out to be detrimental to the communities we hope to help. Even as something as innocuous as buying a pair of shoes could do more harm than good. In the long term, if we want to alleviate poverty and its associated problems—like the lack of shoes for children—individual consumers as well as organizations like TOMS would do better to support directly local businesses for economic growth. It is up to us to invest responsibly in social change.

Guests mingled over wine and cheese while bidding for the items up for auction at a Phillips Brooks House Association fundraiser held in the Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub last night.
The event, which was the eighth annual PBHA auction, drew a diverse crowd of benefactors eager to purchase one of the prizes.
“It’s a blast,” PBHA President Ekene I. Obi-Okoye ’12 said. “People are talking, mingling, donating, bidding.”
Funds raised from the auction will help support PBHA’s Summer Urban Program, during which Harvard students run 12 summer camps for Cambridge and Boston-area children.
During the two-hour silent auction portion of the event, waiters offered sushi and a guitarist sang and played as guests bid for 100 items.
“It brings people together,” Obi-Okoye said. “Everybody is here for one cause. It speaks for what PBHA can do.”
Auction prizes included Boston Red Sox tickets, meals at local restaurants, massage sessions, and a private performance by KeyChange, an on-campus a cappella group.
Ten larger items, which included charter cruises, mini-vacations, and a visit to the “How I Met Your Mother” set, were auctioned off to the highest bidding guests in the live portion of the event.
“I’ve picked up a few interesting items before,” said Kay Van Valkenburgh, a Boston-area business owner, explaining that this was the fourth PBHA auction he had attended. “You tend to see familiar faces and can also meet new people.”
Attendees—a mix of students, alumni, staff, and other Boston and Cambridge residents—generally praised the event.
“PBHA does such a great job of taking great talent at Harvard and putting it to good use,” said event attendee Julie Moscatel, who works in the Harvard Public Affairs and Communications office. “It’s such a worthy cause to celebrate and support.”
PBHA volunteers circulated throughout the room to give benefactors information about the Summer Urban Program, which provides children from ages 6 to 18 with mornings of classroom-based education and afternoons of field trips in and around the Boston area.

Political geographer Georges Prevelakis spoke on the various challenges facing Greece in a discussion hosted by the Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies yesterday afternoon.
Prevelakis, a former Tufts affiliate and current professor at the University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne, elaborated on Greece’s interactions with the European Union and talked about the profound implications of Greece’s debt woes in the wake of the financial crisis.
“Today we received unpleasant news from Greece,” Prevelakis said. “The financial deficit has grown.”
Prevelakis contextualized his speech by discussing Greece’s history and its “contradictory” reputation over the years.
“There is an ambiguity about the image of Greece,” Prevelakis said, noting that the nation’s positive image during the 2004 Olympic Games strongly contrasted with its reputation during the sovereign debt crisis just five years later.
Aside from history, Prevelakis discussed some of the factors that contributed to the debt crisis.
As he explained, neither the private nor the public sector was healthy in the time leading up to Greece’s sovereign debt crisis.
“From the moment Greece was in the Eurozone, it could borrow money,” Prevelakis explained.
But as Greece took out loans from other nations, this capital was not matched by foreign dollars coming into the nation to support business and development.
In fact, “practically no foreign investment was taking place in Greece,” Prevelakis said.
Prevelakis went on to discuss Greece’s issues with corruption in the public sector, particularly in the fields of education and healthcare.
As he explained, Greek taxes often failed to cover the national cost for public services. As a result, many Greek citizens wound up paying for services twice—first through their taxes, and later through under-the-table payments at schools and hospitals.
“The public sector was not functioning well,” Prevelakis said. “These forms of corruption start small but then grow.”
In discussing the nation’s membership in the European Union, Prevelakis said Greece is integral to the EU as “a member for three decades and a pioneer of the enlargement of the EU.”
He continued by noting that the financial problems in Greece are not completely isolated from the rest of Europe.
“Greece is in trouble, but so is the EU,” he said.

Students from Harvard Business School and nearby schools competed yesterday in the 15th annual HBS Business Plan Contest, which provided contest awards of over $150,000 in cash and in-kind services to the winners and runners-up.
The contest, hosted by the Arthur Rock Center for Entrepreneurship and the Social Enterprise Initiative, is intended to prepare students for the entrepreneurial world and give them the opportunity to take advantage of the resources at HBS, organizers said.
The event included both a business venture track and a social venture track in which participants competed.
Throughout the event, finalists from the business venture and social venture tracks presented their entrepreneurial projects to a panel of judges and the audience gathered in Burden Hall.
Two winners were declared for the business venture track: baby.com.br, a company that provides baby care needs to mothers in Brazil via an online warehouse; and BOSS Medical, a medical company that has developed a new device to assist spinal fusion procedures.
The social venture track, a mainstay of the Business Plan Contest since 2001, focuses more specifically on creating nonprofit and for-profit enterprises that possess some social value.
This year’s winner in social venture was SANA Care, an enterprise that will allow medical providers in impoverished areas of India to diagnose cardiovascular conditions in their patients using smartphones.
Laura U. Moon, director of the HBS Social Enterprise Initiative, introduced the social venture track as a means of encouraging social enterprise amongst a student population that might otherwise be interested in traditional for-profit companies.
“Since 2001, there have been more than 550 participants who have created projects in the social venture track,” she said. “Our goal in this track is to educate students in the process of creating and sustaining social enterprises.”
One of the teams in competition for the social venture track award, AppSuccess, was developed to help bright, low-income students get into the college.
“Many low-income students are ready for college but lack support to navigate the process,” said founder Miki Litmanovitz, a joint student at HBS and Harvard Kennedy School.
Past participants in the Business Plan Contest have gone on to develop successful local enterprises, including Finale, the Harvard Square fine dessert bakery.
HBS Dean Nitin Nohria also spoke to the potential of new social enterprise given the ever-changing needs of today’s society.
“This really is an extraordinary thing,” Nohria said. “It is a remarkable example of the talent that exists at this school in our students and faculty. If half of these projects become real companies, it will be remarkable thing.”

Three Japanese visiting scholars presented their end-of-term findings after a yearlong research position at Harvard, addressing Japan’s trade, business, and food security landscape at a panel discussion yesterday in CGIS North.
The presentations marked the end of the Program on U.S.-Japan Relations Seminar series, which was sponsored by the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs.
Taiji Furusawa kicked off the panel with a discussion on the effects of capital movements on international trade.
In particular, Furusawa focused on how investment funds tend to move from the least developed nations to the most developed nations, crossing a conceptual border often referred to as the “North-South divide.”
“Capital moves from the country with less developed financial institutions to the country with the developed financial institution,” Furusawa said.
As a result, developed nations tend to attract more high-quality entrepreneurial projects, further exacerbating inequality.
Following Furusawa’s presentation, research associates Masaki Tone and Tsuyoshi Nozoe presented their work, which also focused on the Japanese economy.
Tone discussed his research on the significant role that small and medium-sized enterprises play in economic development in Japan and the U.S.
Nozoe talked about his research on food security in twenty-first century Japan. He concluded that climate change has caused a shortage in agricultural production at various times in recent decades, making the maintenance of an adequate food stock an important priority.
Moderator and Director of the Program Susan J. Pharr was the first to ask a question of the panelists on Japan’s recent earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear crisis.
“For the past 10 years, Japan has been 40 percent self-sufficient ... Will that balance be affected as consumer confidence takes a while to adjust to eating food from [the affected] regions?”
Nozoe said that while the amount of farmland rendered unusable by the crisis was small, Japan’s agricultural industry may face a “reputation risk.”
“My task is to inform the accurate data and recover the reputation of the Japanese agriculture production,” he added.
In fact, all three of the scholars will be at the forefront of Japan’s recovery, according to Pharr. They will be engaged with nuclear policy, fisheries, and agriculture in the process of “finding solutions to Japan’s current crises,” she said.

A group of current and former Harvard students have banded together to guide a younger generation to success on the science fair circuit.
In January, five Harvard students and alumni published their book, titled “Success with Science: The Winners’ Guide to High School Research.”
The book, published by Research Corporation for Science Advancement, was written by Shiv M. Gaglani ’10, Maria Ellen De Obaldia ’08, Scott Duke Kominers ’09, Dayan “Jack” Li ’11 and Carol Y. Suh ’11 and features a foreword by Nobel Laureate and Harvard professor emeritus Dudley R. Herschbach.
The main goal of the book, the team says, is to inspire a younger generation of students to discover a love of science and to become involved in science research.
All of the authors were involved in science research and competitions in high school.
Gaglani, the main author, conceived the idea for the book when he was a senior in high school, he said. In the spring of 2008, he began recruiting writers from the Harvard College Undergraduate Research Association, an organization he founded in 2006.
Gaglani said he chose each of the authors for their expertise in different areas of science research and understanding of science competitions.
“We hope that ‘Success with Science’ will promote and guide young students to actively engage in scientific progress and technological innovation, since those are the main forces driving our economy,” Gaglani said.
In addition to the five authors, the book features contributions from over fifty other people, including at least twenty faculty members and students associated with Harvard, such as Herschbach, Assistant Professor of Chemistry and Physics Adam E. Cohen ’01, and Physics Professor Lisa J. Randall ’84.
For Suh, meeting other students with similar passions at science fairs was her favorite part of high school. The ability to help other students excel at the fairs was one of the factors that attracted her most to the project, she said.
In addition to selling “Success with Science,” Gaglani said, the team is also distributing books to high schools in underprivileged areas in order to reach out to students who might otherwise be lacking guidance.
Gaglani said he began work on the book while at Harvard in part because he recognized the benefits of having a big research community impart knowledge to younger students.
Gaglani and Kominers both emphasized the benefits of having a close-knit science community. Without Herschbach, they said, the project wouldn’t have been the same.
“It was really special,” said Kominers. “This was a student-driven project serving high school students, with Nobel Laureates on the Harvard faculty helping. It was the sort of incredible thing that can happen at Harvard.”

Harvard may have to re-evaluate how it responds to allegations of sexual harassment and assault to comply with new guidelines announced earlier this month by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Education Secretary Arne Duncan.
The Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights distributed guidelines that clarify Title IX, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex at institutions that receive federal funding.
The guidelines—which elaborate on the law already set out in Title IX—discuss the nature of sexual harassment and explain “schools’ responsibility to take immediate and effective steps to end sexual harassment and sexual violence.”
The guidelines instruct schools to investigate all complaints under a “more likely than not” standard of evidence as opposed to the more rigorous “clear and convincing” standard that some schools currently use.
Associate Dean of the College and Secretary of the Administrative Board John “Jay” L. Ellison said that Harvard has never required a high standard of evidence in order to investigate a complaint.
But he added that other schools are “all over the place with standard of evidence.”
Harvard Law School is currently the subject of an investigation that was initiated earlier this month for alleged discrepancies in policy for handling sexual assault cases.
Director of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Sarah A. Rankin said that she believes the guidelines were created to help schools more effectively handle cases of sexual harassment.
“My thinking is that their sense is that campuses were in need of guidance,” Rankin said. “It was really to clarify the points that they perceived schools were struggling with to understand and meet.”
Rankin said she believes that the University’s Office of General Counsel is currently examining all of the schools across meet the requirements.
While other schools adopt legal terminology for their policies on sexual harassment, Ellison said that Harvard prioritizes student safety.
“We need to make sure that everyone has an ability to talk to someone to get advice, to get counsel, to know what their options are without starting a process they can’t control.”
The guidelines clarify that every school must appoint a Title IX officer who is responsible for making sure that the University is in compliance.
Susan B. Marine, director of the Harvard College Women’s Center and Harvard’s Title IX officer, did not respond to requests for comment.
The release of new guidelines for Title IX coincides with a complaint filed this month by current students and graduates of Yale, who allege that Yale is in violation of Title IX.
In a letter to the Yale community, Yale University President Richard C. Levin said that the school will “cooperate fully with the Office of Civil Rights in their investigation.”
Levin also said that he had appointed an external “Advisory Committee on Campus Climate” to examine how sexual harassment might be more effectively handled and combatted by Yale University.
In 2003, the Office for Civil Rights considered a complaint that was filed against Harvard University that alleged that revisions to the school’s dispute procedure discriminated against students who filed complaints of sexual assault.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At 5 p.m. on a Saturday night, Rabeea Ahmed ’14 is working on her website when she receives an email from a sexual assault victim halfway around the world.
For Ahmed, the rest of the night will be spent in a back-and-forth that she describes as part counseling session and part suicide-prevention.
Born and raised in Pakistan, Ahmed has run a sexual assault support group for over four years, carrying her work over with her to Harvard.
Trying to exude a sense of calm to the woman on the receiving end of the email exchange, Ahmed retains her composure. Emotionally draining as it is, she says, she left her computer only when the woman on the other end wrote she was going to sleep.
“Sometimes, you have to stay up with them to prevent them from committing suicide or hurting themselves,” she says. “I have not lost anyone yet, but there is that danger, and I take that very seriously,” she says.
The Pakistani woman’s recollections of her sexual abuse were preventing her from sleeping the entire night, Ahmed says. The guilt and lack of support from her family pushed her to considering  suicide, the victim told Ahmed.
Ahmed says her service, 7,000 miles away, provided the victim her sole support system.
On April 11, Ahmed launched a website, speaknowsmileagain.wordpress.com, to help reach out to sexual abuse victims across Pakistan.
She says she drew inspiration from the website for the American organization, Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network.
“Many of the victims that I worked with have never found any site that was Pakistan specific and dealt with the social stigma specific to Pakistan,” she says. “When these victims go to rainn.org they do find help, but it’s not always something specific to their own circumstances.”
So Ahmed decided in the fall to create her own website, which today features posts from anonymous victims and professionals such as psychologists, as well as support resources and contact information.
WE DON’T BELIEVE YOU
“It’s normal.” “Don’t tell anyone.” “We don’t believe you.”
For young women in Pakistan, says Ahmed, these are the first words they hear when they reveal to their parents that they have been sexually abused.
To Ahmed’s surprise, abuse victims included young women and men within her own circle of friends from her native Islamabad—a fact she learned when they began approaching her for help.
“Even though I came from a middle-class background, over a third of my friends had gone through traumatic abuse, but they never talked about it because they were ashamed,” says Ahmed.
Her support groups with abuse victims began with her providing advice, guidance, and consolation to friends of hers who had been abused. Word spread about her service and, since 2007, she has been working with victims from across Islamabad over email.
Because these victims may get in trouble if their families find out that they are asking for help, Ahmed’s website encourages victims to create an alternate email address to minimize the chances of getting caught. It also encourages the victims to remain anonymous for the duration of their communication with members of the website.
Although sexual abuse is not uncommon in Pakistan, cases of assault are often covered up and the victim is often blamed, says Ahmed.
In situations where married women are sexually abused and choose to reveal their experience to their spouses, divorce often ensues rather than support, she says.
In extreme cases, Ahmed says, suicide can result from the victimization and psychological harm that befalls the victims, who is often left to deal with their trauma alone.
Ahmed says that even in the existing women shelters, there is little psychological support—one psychologist is often assigned to hundreds of victims in the shelters.
The shelters leave a cradle outside for women to leave unwanted newborns, says Ahmed.
Ahmed says that in Pakistan, where corruption charges surround the Justice Department and topics of sexual abuse are taboo, “one cannot give the victims false hope of justice.”
“For me the goal is to find a way to let their voice to be heard and to help them survive and heal,” she says.
Until recently, the rape laws in Pakistan required multiple witnesses for conviction, leaving many offenders unpunished.
Ahmed also says that there is a misconception that the lack of reporting of sexual abuse in Pakistan is related to religion.
“The shame associated with the abuse is more of a social and cultural issue that is widespread throughout Southeast Asia and is not limited to countries where the majority holds a specific religious belief,” she says.
TAKING THE INITIATIVE
Ahmed was first exposed to the subject when she was 14 and was selected to speak about sexual abuse with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights at a conference.
“I asked the commissioner what the U.N. could do about the situation in Pakistan. The response I got was shocking because I was told that ‘It’s a matter of your government,’” says Ahmed.
Ahmed says she realized that the resources for victims in Pakistan were limited.
Ahmed began to hear a number of accounts of sexual abuse—including from her friends.
She soon entered into a dialogue with some of the victims, spawning her own sexual assault support group.
In the summer of her junior year of high school, Ahmed interned at Handicap International in Pakistan.
There, Ahmed had the chance to work with a cluster of organizations dealing with a refugee crisis in Pakistan.
But at the time, she says, these organizations placed little emphasis on fighting the trafficking of women. So Ahmed proposed that they make a separate working group for them—and they were convinced.
GROWING TRAFFIC
Since further development of the website and its resources require money, Ahmed has begun planning a fundraiser at Harvard that she hopes to launch in the fall of 2011.
Currently, Ahmed has Pakistani volunteers working to get her website advertised on primetime television in Pakistan, and she is trying to fundraise to pay for posters to advertise her website at Pakistani universities.
They are also helping her translate the website into Urdu.
A recent Facebook page has already received nearly 400 followers.
The increase in traffic to her website has attracted Ahmed’s friends and former support group members into helping her administer the website and answer emails from abuse victims.
Ahmed says she and her team work around the clock to ensure that no cry for help goes unanswered.
“I personally know of cases where people have emailed larger organizations where they were never replied to,” she says. “In my work, I don’t trade off quality for quantity.”
The classes she has taken while at Harvard, such as Science of Living Systems 17 and Computer Science 1, have helped her, she says, with understanding everything from psychological aspects of trauma to developing the coding for her website.
And as the publicity director for the Harvard Undergraduate Legal Committee, she says she has gained valuable experience as she now promotes her services and her website.
She says her connections at Harvard—including her roommate Karolina M. Dos Santos ’14—have also provided support.
“For every idea Rabeea [Ahmed] presents me, I try to troubleshoot possible problems that could arise and we work together on how to solve them,” says Dos Santos.
“I’m so proud of Rabeea because she is applying the knowledge she’s gained from the classroom to help hundreds of people.”

A male student in Pforzheimer House was robbed at gunpoint Monday at 10:30 p.m. on Linnaean Street while walking toward Mass. Ave., according to the Cambridge police log.
The student was not injured. The suspect allegedly stole the student’s wallet and cell phone.
Cambridge police responded to the incident and arrested a suspect.
Soon after the incident, Aaron Burnes, 19, was arrested for armed robbery, carrying a firearm without a license, possession of a firearm in a felony, and the possession of a large capacity firearm, according to the police log.
House Masters Nicholas A. Christakis and Erika L. Christakis ’86 sent an email to Pforzheimer residents about the incident.
In the email, they wrote that HUPD has increased the presence of security guards on campus.
“As we’ve seen from the Kirkland shooting, no part of the campus is immune to this sort of thing,” Nicholas Christakis said in an interview Tuesday night.
He has been in contact with the other Quad House Masters to discuss whether the Quad is particularly vulnerable to this type of crime.
“It’s hard to know whether [the Quad] is slightly less trafficked or not,” he said.
The College is working with HUPD to determine if there are any responses Quad Masters and students can take, Nicholas Christakis said.
“We don’t want to underreact or overreact,” he said.
“We’re aware of the fact that we live in a city and everyone has to be careful,” he said.
Last Tuesday at 10:50 p.m., a male graduate student was robbed at knife point on Prescott Street near the Harvard Faculty Club.
HUPD advised students to use well-lit routes or designated pathways and  the shuttle bus services in the email from the  House Masters.

A panel of journalists and political activists agreed that the Tea Party has become an increasingly important force in American politics at a discussion entitled “The Tea Party: What’s Brewing for the Budget Battle and the Ballot Box,” hosted by the Institute of Politics yesterday.
The speakers focused on the Tea Party’s origins and how it will factor into the current budget debate as well as the upcoming presidential election.
“It’s time for the Republic to return to the people’s hands,” said Andrew Hemingway, chairman of the Republican Liberty Caucus of New Hampshire. He was joined by Jenny Beth Martin, national coordinator and co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, CNN reporter and producer Shannon Travis, and New York Times political correspondent Kate Zernike.
The discussion was moderated by IOP Director C. M. Trey Grayson ’94.
Hemingway and Martin made the point throughout the evening that the Tea Party is a grassroots organization and adheres to three strict values: fiscal responsibility, limited government, and free markets.
The panelists were all largely in agreement over what the Tea Party is, but they disagreed over its political potential.
“The knife cuts both ways,” Travis said, adding that the group was in danger of becoming a victim of its own prodigious growth.
“The tea party’s success and tactics have given fodder to their critics,” he added, questioning the organization’s ability to influence politics at a national as well as at a state level.
Zernike said that those politicians elected through Tea Party support might be forced to choose between answering the demands of the group and the wider demands of Americans at large.
The real question, she said, was not what the Tea Party has achieved already, but what it will do next.
All the panelists were in general agreement that the next two years will be very important for the Tea Party. But the debate became more heated once the floor was opened up for questions.
When one questioner mentioned alleged sponsorship of the Tea Party by the Koch brothers—two wealthy industrialists who are often associated with Republican causes—Hemingway jokingly asked if the questioner knew the brothers and could get them to send him a check.
Following the event, several audience members said they were pleased with the quality of the discussion.
“The panel solidified many of the beliefs I already had,” said Ben Grivno, an audience member and self-described Tea Party activist.
Luciana E. Milano ’14 said she was glad to attend a contentious panel.
“I was excited to see the bickering,” she said.

The recent disaster at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant in Japan is a “decision moment” for the nuclear power community, according to Associate Professor of Public Policy at Kennedy School of Government Matthew Bunn in a talk yesterday titled “Chernobyl, Fukushima, and the Future of Nuclear Energy.”
Bunn delivered his talk as part of a day-long lecture series that took a retrospective look at Chernobyl and the current status of nuclear power on the 25th anniversary of the devastating nuclear disaster.
Bunn, whose research focuses on nuclear proliferation and international nuclear policy, explored the nuclear landscape after the earthquake and tsunami that led to releases of radioactive materials at Fukushima that began in March and urged for more stringent safety standards and a process of international review for nuclear reactors.
“The event was especially relevant in light of the recent disaster in Japan,” said Cris L. Martin, outreach director at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies, which hosted the event.
“We had four very knowledgeable and engaging speakers that understood the significance of the anniversary of Chernobyl in current events,” she said.
Lectures were given on the history, ecological consequences, and political impact of the Chernobyl disaster.
Bunn’s talk focused on nuclear power in the 21st century, and he specifically discussed technical details of the Fukushima disaster and ways in which such disasters can be avoided in the future.
“What will come out of Fukushima? I’m hoping it has shown us that we need to address issues of safety and security in the nuclear power community moving forward,” Bunn said.
The recent disaster in Japan has clear parallels to that of Chernobyl 25 years ago, which badly damaged public confidence in nuclear energy and severely slowed the rate of construction of nuclear reactors in the year following the disaster.
Bunn predicted that nuclear energy will be a tough sell in the United States in the coming years.
Citing economic factors, such as cheap energy in the absence of a carbon tax and low prices of natural gas, Bunn said he wasn’t optimistic about the odds of a substantial number of new reactors being constructed in the States.
“Fukushima makes the prospect of using nuclear energy even less attractive,” Bunn added.
And while Bunn expressed hope that lessons will be gleaned from the recent disaster, he said the outlook isn’t rosy.
“We’re already seeing a falling-off of concern. It’s unfortunate.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The teaching staff of Life Sciences 1b is investigating possible disciplinary measures for “course-wide cheating,” according to an email sent by teaching fellow Iain J. MacLeod to his students last week.
MacLeod wrote that the teaching staff believes that students were using a Facebook group called Ls1b to cheat on questions during lecture quizzes and breakouts—questions that are asked during lecture and answered via clickers registered in students’ names.
“It has come [to] our attention that a large number of LS1b students are using the LS1b Facebook group in order to share the answers to the clicker and lecture quizzes, while the quizzes are taking place,” MacLeod wrote.
He added that, as a result, the grading scheme for the course is being revised due to “course-wide cheating.”
Soon after the email was sent, the Facebook group was deactivated.
Caroline M. Weisman ’14, a member of the Facebook group, said that the accusation was unfounded. She said that both preceptors encouraged collaboration during breakouts.
“During breakouts there was audible chatter,” Weisman said. “People would be talking to everyone around them. It was encouraged to collaborate on breakout questions.”
Another member of the Facebook group, who asked to remain anonymous due to concerns about potential disciplinary action, said that during quizzes, teaching fellows would patrol the aisles and most students would close their laptops.
“My main purpose for the group was to express frustrations about the class,” he said. “Personally, I never used it to cheat.”
According to another anonymous member of the Facebook group, for the first couple of weeks, group chat was used to collaborate on problem set questions and clicker questions. But soon after, the number of members became too large to host chats, as the group had over 300 members at its peak.
He said that the group was “a social center” for collaboration to talk about questions students had about the course and how to solve problem sets. He said he never witnessed answers to problem sets being directly given.
“Obviously, we have no objection to Facebook pages for you to vent your frustrations about the course,” MacLeod wrote. “Yet the university takes academic dishonesty extremely seriously and I’d hate for any one of my students to be brought to the attention of the Ad Board.”
Weisman explained that during the second half of the semester, students used the group as a forum via which to petition for a change in the course’s grading policy.
Preceptors Casey Roehrig and Lynne M. Mullen declined to comment.
Human Evolutionary Biology Professor Maryellen Ruvolo, who co-teaches the course, could not be reached for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The US Women’s hockey team will have to wait until 2014 to get its full measure of revenge. But after losing to the Canadians last year in the Vancouver Olympics, the American national team took back the world title yesterday at the IIHF Women’s World Championship in Switzerland.
Harvard coach Katey Stone led the squad to a title over the Canadians. After losing 2-0 in the Olympic finals a year ago, the US would not fall short this year, winning 3-2 in overtime.
Four Harvard icewomen, past and present, were on the world champion roster, but sophomore Josephine Pucci was the only active member of the Harvard team to play for the US.
Angela Ruggiero ’02-’04, the team’s captain, Julie Chu ’06-’07, and Caitlin Cahow ’07-’08 all suited up for their former college coach as well. To go along with their Olympic silver medals, the three have all won three world titles.
The women’s hockey team was at its most dominant during the careers of these three players. Between 2003 and 2005, Harvard made three straight appearances in the NCAA National Finals, although ultimately never gaining the trophy.
Despite having lost in the Olympics, the American team has now won three straight IIHF Championships, dating back to 2008. Since the tournament was first played in 1990, no team other than the United States or Canadian has ever won a gold or silver medal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the school year comes to a close, Ivy League sports are wrapping up as well. But for Harvard, the spring doesn’t look quite as cheery. Baseball’s out of the league title hunt, while both the men’s and women’s golf teams failed to win it all. Meanwhile, our counterpart in New Haven is doing quite well, capturing two Ivy titles this weekend. And if all goes well next weekend, Yale has a chance to be crowned the top dog in Ancient Eight baseball as well. We’ll tell you just what you need to know in this week’s version of Around the Water Cooler.
The Harvard baseball team will have to wait until at least 2012 to claim an Ivy League title.
After splitting last weekend’s four-game series against Yale at O’Donnell Field, the Crimson remained five back in the Red Rolfe Division standings. But with only four league contests left, Harvard is now mathematically eliminated from the title hunt.
The series had its bright spots for Harvard, though. Senior Max Perlman pitched a gem on Friday against the Bulldogs, going the distance and notching a season-high ten strikeouts to propel the Crimson to a 1-0 win. For the effort, Perlman was named Ivy League Pitcher of the Week. Two days after Perlman’s performance, Harvard plated 10 runs, the team’s third-highest total this year.
While this upcoming weekend’s games don’t mean much for the Crimson, they’re critical for the other teams in the Rolfe Division. More likely than not, the title will come down to Dartmouth and Yale, who are tied atop the standings.  So, this weekend, in a four-game Harvard v. Dartmouth series, the Crimson will have the chance to end the Big Green’s reign atop the Ancient Eight.
In the Lou Gehrig Division, Princeton is securely at the top. Just one win this weekend over lowly Cornell would give the Tigers the berth into the Ivy League Championship Series.
Speaking of championships, both men’s and women’s golf had their Ivy League Championships this weekend.  Yale continued its domination of spring sports, winning both events. On the men’s side, the Bulldogs coasted to an easy victory, winning by a whopping 20 strokes. It all came together for Yale on Sunday, when the champions shot +4, 14 strokes better than the next-best team.
On the women’s side, the Bulldogs only managed to best the second-place Crimson by four strokes. Harvard only trailed by two going into the final day but failed to keep pace with Yale. The Bulldogs continue their season May 5-7 in the NCAA East Regional.
In the world of men’s lacrosse, some solid play by senior attackman Dean Gibbons gave Harvard the chance to extend its season and qualify for the Ivy League Tournament. The senior scored three goals in last Saturday’s must-win contest against Princeton. Now, Harvard’s sitting pretty, as a victory over Yale this weekend would guarantee entrance into tournament

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Flying towards home plate on freshman Kasey Lange’s rocket down the right field line, co-captain Ellen Macadam made a sudden dive headfirst. Grazing her fingertips over the plate just in time to score the final run, Macadam helped the Harvard softball team (30-14, 14-2 Ivy) grab the second of two victories against Yale (15-23, 6-10 Ivy) in yesterday’s doubleheader.
After a close 12-11 win in the first game of the day, the Crimson came back to mercy the Bulldogs 11-3, concluding Harvard’s four-game sweep of Yale.
The squad grabbed two victories against the Bulldogs in Sunday’s doubleheader.
“I thought it was a great sweep for us,” Macadam said. “I don’t think we’ve ever had this strong of an offensive team, not that I’ve seen. So it was great to see us continuing to hit all the pitches and scoring a lot of runs.”
HARVARD 11, YALE 3
After nearly losing the first game of the doubleheader, Harvard came back firing in the second contest, scoring six runs in the second inning to gain an early 6-2 lead.
Junior shortstop Jane Alexander started the rally, singling up the middle with bases loaded to bring home junior first baseman Whitney Shaw.
Freshman right fielder Shelbi Olson walked in sophomore left fielder Ashley Heritage, and Macadam’s rocket to left field brought in another.
Sophomore center fielder Stephanie Regan then smacked one in between the Bulldogs’ third baseman and left fielder to plate one more, and Lange blasted a two-RBI double to bring the Crimson’s lead to four runs.
After a quick third inning in which neither team scored, Yale attempted a comeback in the fourth, knocking in a run to bring the deficiency down to 6-3.
But this wasn’t enough to stop Harvard, which scored three more runs in the bottom of the fourth off a Lange two-run home run and freshman catcher Ali Scott’s RBI double to right field.
Crimson freshman pitcher Laura Ricciardone kept the Bulldogs scoreless in the top of the fifth as classmate Lange dominated defensively, making all three outs to first.
“The freshmen have been so important,” Heritage said. “They just came in so gutsy without nerves, and have given it everything they have. They play such an important role on our team.”
Yale was not prepared to give up just yet, switching pitchers in the bottom of the fifth inning to throw a defensive curveball at the Harvard offense.
But once again Yale could not halt the Crimson’s lineup, as Macadam singled through the left side to plate Alexander.
Lange then hit a single down the right side to bring home Macadam and cut the game short at five innings.
“Laura [Ricciardone] was really sick today actually so the fact that we could finish in five innings and give her a break was perfect,” Scott said. “It was just what she needed.”
HARVARD 12, YALE 11
In the first game of the day, Harvard was seconds away from an 11-6 victory when in the top of the seventh inning, a dropped third strike—what would have been a game-ending third out—ultimately became the start of a five-run rally for the Bulldogs.
The matchup began with Yale taking a 4-1 lead after the first inning, the Crimson’s sole run resulting from a Regan sacrifice that brought home Macadam.
In the second inning, the Harvard defense kicked into gear, keeping the Bulldogs from scoring throughout the next three innings while the Crimson took back the lead, 6-4.
By the end of the fifth inning the score was tied at six runs apiece as Yale scored two, and Harvard brought home one with Zumbro’s sacrifice fly to right field.
In the sixth inning, the Crimson held the Bulldogs scoreless for a fourth time and gained hold of the lead by knocking in four runs off of three hits and three errors.
Then just when it looked like Harvard had secured an 11-6 victory, Yale took the second chance given to them by a dropped third strike.
A five-run rally by the Bulldogs followed to tie the score, 11-11.
But the Crimson offense remained relentless.
Alexander tripled to right center and scored on a Macadam single to pull out a win for Harvard.
Now with a league record of 14-2, the Crimson needs only one win against Dartmouth in next weekend’s doubleheader to clinch the North Division and advance to the Ancient Eight championship game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When you’re the only freshman who’s played in every game, when you’re tied for third in points (22) and tied for second in assists (7) for Harvard, and when you have the highest shot percentage (0.517) on the men’s lacrosse team (8-5, 2-3 Ivy), you know you’re doing something right. The only question: how did Daniel Eipp slip under the radar for so long?
As part of a standout group of freshmen, the majority of whom took a year off before Harvard to finesse their skills, Eipp might have been overlooked among the impressive accomplishments. But this year’s numbers don’t lie, and as the season continues, Eipp proves to be an indispensable part of the Crimson lineup.
“He’s a very smart lacrosse player with a very high lacrosse IQ, in addition to [having] exceptional quickness, speed, and change of directions,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik said. “He’s as quick and his first step is as fast as anyone on the team. He’s very difficult to cover as an offensive player.”
It’s no wonder Eipp is talented, after growing up in Syracuse, N.Y., a hot bed of lacrosse. It was simply a natural outcome when he started playing at the age of five. Eipp played varsity football and basketball throughout high school, but as he grew older his passion for lacrosse strengthened and he shifted his focus solely on lacrosse for college. His specialization paid off—in his senior year Eipp captained his high school team and received All-American accolades.
Eipp’s first stop on his college tour was Harvard, and it was love at first sight. So when he received the offer of admission from the Crimson lacrosse coaches, he readily accepted.
“I just fell in love with it the first time I stepped on campus,” Eipp said. “I don’t know how anyone could turn down an offer from Harvard, being such a great academic school and what we’re doing so far on the lacrosse field.”
However, while Eipp felt excited to get into his new uniform, he also felt anxious. The Massachusetts native was one of the only ones among a strong class of freshmen who did not take a gap year.
“Before coming to Harvard, I always wished I took another year to post graduate, but it’s more your mindset, not how much lacrosse you’ve played in your high school career or your post-graduate career,” Eipp said. “It’s just the type of player that you are and what you can do at the college level.”
Eipp has proven this time and time again this season, especially in big games. In a March contest against Bellarmine, he picked up four goals and an assist, and caused a turnover closing the game with five points—a career high. In early April against Albany, Eipp scored three goals and had a ground ball.
Yet the undisputed highlight of Eipp’s season occurred at Soldiers Field against Georgetown on March 8.  For Wojcik and the rest of the coaching staff, the third quarter specifically showcased Eipp’s full potential and skill. In the every previous game, Eipp had played midfield, but when the team called upon him he effortlessly transitioned into an attacker.
“Dan can play midfield, he can play attack,” Wojcik said. “He’s a player that’s very multidimensional. He does have a dynamic skill set where we can use him in a number of areas. ”
Tallying two goals and one assist in the second half of the game, Eipp was largely responsible for securing the first ever Crimson victory over Georgetown in a 16-15 barnburner.
“It was my first game really being able to play. Coach put me in a lot, and I was able to isolate my defender,” Eipp said. “After that game my confidence has gone up and I’ve been able to show what I can do on the field. ”
Games like Georgetown have earned Eipp Ivy League Rookie of the Week honors in both the weeks of March 14 and April 4.
But Eipp won’t stop here. Wojcik sees him not only continuing to exceed expectations and improve, but also taking a larger leadership role.
“He’s certainly exceeded our expectations because of how hard he’s worked and the level of his talent,” Wojcik said. “We’ve found a really important role for him on the team and he’s certainly excelled so far. In years to come we expect Dan to be a really big part of our offense and a really big part of our team.”
As the squad faces Yale this weekend—a match-up that will decide its fate for both the Ivy League tournament and  the NCAA tournament—the Crimson will need Eipp to continue to step up and stand out.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a tight 1-0 victory over UMass in the preliminary round of the Beanpot last Tuesday, the Crimson hoped to claim its first tournament title since 2005 under the Fenway Park lights last night against BC. But, unfortunately for Harvard, the Eagles shut out the Crimson, earning the 2011 Beanpot Championship with a commanding 8-0 victory.
“We didn’t really come to play offensively,” freshman leftfielder Jack Colton said. “But it was really cool playing at Fenway and definitely something I’ll remember for the rest of my life. We didn’ t really play our best ball, but it was a cool experience nonetheless.”
Although the opening frame was uneventful, BC got on the board first with a run in the top of the second, as two Harvard errors helped junior infielder Anthony Melchionda reach home plate. Melchionda—who led off the inning for the Eagles—earned BC’s first hit of the day with a single to left field before converting the unearned run to put the Eagles up by one.
“Everybody came out to play and was really excited,” captain catcher Tyler Albright said. “We stepped out onto the field with a little bit of awe.”
BC struck again in the fourth, as the Eagles converted a string of hits for a run.
Junior pitcher Andrew Lawrence earned the RBI, sending home senior Garret Smith who opened the top of the inning with a double up the middle.
Lawrence impressed on the mound as well, earning the win for BC, striking out one batter and allowing just one hit in three innings pitched.
Only down 2-0, the Crimson had a chance to close the gap in the bottom of the fourth.
Senior centerfielder Dillon O’Neill started the inning off for Harvard with a single.
With one out, freshman third baseman Jake McGuiggan threaded the ball between first and second base on the ground to advance O’Neill to scoring position.
But the two runners would be left on base, as Harvard failed to convert this key scoring opportunity.
BC increased its lead in the sixth, converting two runs on three hits.
A Crimson error contributed to the second of these runs, as Harvard failed to pick off Perdios at second base, allowing a single by Payne to send him home.
A highlight for the Crimson came from freshman leftfielder Jack Colton in the seventh inning. With bases loaded, the rookie made a diving catch to keep the inning scoreless.
“It was tough to read the ball up there,” Colton said. “I was playing pretty shallow, so it game me a chance to go out and snag that line drive. It was pretty cool to make a sliding catch at leftfield at Fenway and definitely something I won’t forget.”
The first three pitchers in the lineup last night mirrored the group used by Harvard in the first round of the Beanpot against UMass, as senior Dan Berardo, junior Jonah Klees, and senior Andrew Hatch saw action in that order during both games.
Unfortunately for the Crimson, this group of Harvard pitchers had a less dominant night, allowing four runs.
Though Harvard was able to silence the Eagles’ bats in the seventh and eighth innings, BC doubled its lead to finish out the ninth.
In the ninth inning, the Crimson made three pitching changes, using sophomores Matt Doyle and Zach Olsen and senior Zach Hofeld. Despite the changes, the Eagles converted four more runs in the ninth, to put Harvard in its final eight-run hole.
BC accumulated 12 hits to Harvard’s seven on the night, and five Crimson errors helped the Eagles to the shutout.
In spite of the loss, the Crimson relished the opportunity to play under the lights at Fenway.
“It was a very cool opportunity to play at Fenway, especially under the lights,” Albright said.
“It was definitely a cool experience getting all of the kids an opportunity to play at Fenway,” Colton continued. “It’s an extra competitive experience that we like to have. It’s a lot of fun and I hope the red sox keep letting us play there."

The quick and dirty about what's been going on around the Ancient Eight (and other schools too).
The presence of a camel at a University of Pennsylvania fraternity during Spring Fling—the university's annual spring celebration notorious for drunken debauchery—sparked controversy after a university affiliate reported it to the media.
George Leslie—a postdoctoral fellow—said that he saw the camel as he passed by the Zeta Psi fraternity. Leslie told the Daily Pennsylvanian that the fraternity "was packed full of people, all around the camel" and "girls were groping it, and they were drunk."
According to the Daily Pennsylvanian, an investigation into the incident launched by the university later cleared the fraternity of any wrongdoing.
New details recently surfaced regarding actress Emma Watson's announcement that she was taking time off from Brown University. The New York Daily News reported that classmates heckled the star—who has said on her personal blog that she "want[ed] to be normal." When the actress answered a question in class, classmates would respond with references to her Harry Potter persona, with quips such as "Three points for Gryffindor!" The New York Daily News also reported that the star was "stalked" by Harvard students at a Brown-vs.-Harvard football game this past fall.
A spokeswoman for Watson said last week that the actress would not be returning to Brown, and instead planned to transfer to another college in the fall. 
Yale University President Richard Levin announced the creation of an advisory committee to investigate a complaint filed by 16 students that the university has a "hostile sexual environment." In an email sent to Yale students, Levin wrote that the committee would advise him on "how sexual harassment, violence, or misconduct might be more effectively combated at Yale." The student complaint is currently under investigation by the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights.
Tony Kadyhrob—a 68-year-old white male who has been charged with the attempted abduction of a female student at Rider University—was found "luring" near Princeton University earlier this month. Police found Kadyhrob—who was banned from entering any New Jersey school property as a condition of his bail—in Princeton Borough. He was later released because he had not been seen on university or school property and had therefore not violated the terms of his bail.
Kadyhrob has since become a joke among Princeton students. Recently, someone created a fake Twitter account for Kadyhrob with the description "Caught, still luring though."
