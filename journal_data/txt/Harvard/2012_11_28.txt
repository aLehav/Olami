2012 was an ironic year for the Earth, for more than 2012 reasons. Below is a list of 10 things that we think are actually worth mentioning to people, so pay attention, please.
1) Mitt Romney tells a jobless American woman that he’s unemployed. After November 6th, Romney is still apparently unemployed.
2) Kim Kardashian on the sanctity of marriage in 2012: “the best part of life—finding that person you can be with forever and have a really good relationship with.” Things longer than Kim Kardashian’s marriage: the average Qdoba line; Michael Jordan’s baseball career; the time during which “Macarena” was #1 on Billboard’s top 100 list; time it takes a burger from McDonald’s to decompose; time during which Violet from “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” chewed on gum; Martha Stewart’s time behind bars (by bars we mean country club jail); the NBA lockout. So much for the best part of life....
3) Kim Kardashian has been trying to get divorced for longer than she was married (filed for divorce 72 days after getting married, over one year ago).
4) Dick Clark dies of a heart attack after having surgery to correct his enlarged prostate. More importantly, the owner of the Segway Company died in Segway crash (2010).
5) “Jesus was born earlier than thought,” says The Pope in new book “Jesus of Nazareth—The Infancy Narratives.” Speaking of things that everyone’s known for a really long time....
6) Caviar vending machines open in Los Angeles. Can I get fries with that? (By fries, we mean bellinis).
7) Rush Limbaugh calls New Jersey Governor Chris Christie fat. Limbaugh does not plan on joining a gym anytime soon. Also calls kettle black, also calls Pope Catholic, also calls sky blue, also calls your mother a whore.
8) Romney’s victory website went live before the election was over. He lost. If you want to brush up on Romney’s $5 trillion tax plan: http://www.romneytaxplan.com/
 9) Portrait of Honey Boo-Boo “ironically” constructed entirely out of trash. Not pictured but actually ironic: The clothes her family obtains and actually wears from dumpster diving in rural Georgia.
10) Lindsay Lohan, professional criminal, moonlights as actress.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There was darkness at the dawn of the 1960s, and it came in the form of melodramatic ditties about young men and women dying. The teenage tragedy, perhaps the most morbid of all pop subgenres, reigned supreme in those days, with tracks like "Leader of the Pack" and "Dead Man’s Curve" triumphantly riding premature burial to resounding commercial success. These memorable songs were truly ahead of their time; not until Marilyn Manson started writing lyrics about Columbine would such subjects again occupy such a prominent place in popular music. Below, six songs from the golden age of teenage death, as tasteless as they are timeless.
Mark Dinning – "Teen Angel"
Musically, this track is far too sedate: Dinning aims for quiet gravitas and ends up with soporific dreck. Lyrically, it’s a masterpiece, filled with both touching details (the titular figure gets hit by a train because she went to retrieve her boyfriend’s graduation ring), and unexpected bluntness—near the end of the song, Dinning sings, "I’ll never kiss your lips again / they buried you today." If only Phil Spector had gotten his hands on this one.
The Breakers – "Surfin’ Tragedy"
Though the third-person narrative means this song is a little emotionally distant, the Breakers compensate with a tragic sense of inevitability. In most teen tragedies, disaster erupts out of the blue; "Surfin’ Tragedy" reminds the listener of what’s to come with every chorus. That fatalistic drive, along with a lachrymose French horn hook, is enough to make this an enduring semiclassic, despite the fact that it was featured on "The Rhino Brothers Present the World’s Worst Records."
Johnny Preston – "Running Bear"
In this charming tune, a Native American boy falls in love with a girl from another tribe. Sadly, they can never be together because of inter-tribal animosity. They’re also separated by a large river, which appears to be a metaphor until they try to swim across it and end up drowning. That remarkably gruesome ending distinguishes this song from a legion of Romeo and Juliet ripoffs, but Preston’s real feat is littering faux-Indian war chants throughout the track.
Twinkle – "Terry"
Upon first listen, "Terry" seems like nothing more than a British update of "Leader of the Pack," since both songs feature a misunderstood motorcyclist meeting an untimely death. What distinguishes this track is its overriding sense of guilt; while the lovers in "Leader of the Pack" were separated because of some hopelessly square parental units, Terry goes off to his death because his lover was "untrue on the night he died." Skip "Atonement"—here’s all the English regret you’ll ever need. Extra points for being banned by the BBC.
Ray Peterson – "Tell Laura I Love Her"
This early teen tragedy starts out in "Gift of the Magi" territory, with the kind but insolvent Tommy wanting to shower his Laura with presents. Within moments, it descends into B-movie schlock; Tommy enters a stock car race to win a thousand dollars, crashes his vehicle, and dies in a flaming wreck. Also featured: a final chorus where Tommy sings to Laura from beyond the grave.
John Leyton – "Johnny Remember Me"
This song lacks graduation rings, Indian war whoops, and car crash sound effects. What it has in spades is spine-chilling atmosphere. Like "Tell Laura I Love Her," "Johnny Remember Me" features singing from deceased persons; in fact, it’s virtually a duet between Leyton and his lost love. Granted, that’s probably just an excuse for oddball producer Joe Meek to show off his command of the studio—the unnamed girl’s otherworldly vocals are drowning in reverb—but it’s also what makes this track so haunting. The deeply felt emotions of teenage tragedy songs are captured in their purest form here, and it’s creepy as hell.

As I sat at home eating a long-awaited Thanksgiving meal with my family this past week, I could not help but reflect in the nostalgic, if cliché, way that people do at this time of year on the many things in my life for which I am tremendously thankful. Specifically, on this Thanksgiving, it was Harvard to which I wanted to give thanks.
For the past month, I have participated in a nearly perpetual bemoaning of Harvard’s culture. “All we do is whine about how much work we have,” “My friends from high school are having so much fun; college isn’t supposed to be like this,” “Why can’t we even bring ourselves to relax during the week of the Game?” But while at times it feels like the work-life balance here is perpetually askew, relationships are confined to 45-minute dinners in dining halls, and pressures to be productive at all times are all-consuming, this Thanksgiving, it was still Harvard I wanted to thank.
I am thankful to have met some of the most interesting and passionate people on the planet: a girl I met while running who is able to convey the urgency of our climate crisis in an inspirational and accessible way, a freshman entryway mate who is traveling to India over winter break to study art, a blockmate who actually glows when he talks about neurobiology, and a friend who is so moved by the readings in her poetry class that I often find myself being read passages of Keats.
I am thankful to have unparalleled opportunities for intellectual engagement and exploration at the tip of my fingers. Beginning to browse next semesters’ course catalogue (one of my procrastination activities at this point in the semester), I am overwhelmed by the multitude of unique and interesting classes we can take with professors whose extraordinary accomplishments are matched by a sincere love for their subjects. And then there is the onslaught of events we can attend: from discussions with world leaders to lectures on science and cooking, from conferences on social entrepreneurship to bike rides to Walden Pond with the Outing Club, from Habitat for Humanity build days to student art and music productions. To be in a place and a point in our lives where we get to learn something new literally every day is something to be very thankful for. Our job right now is to read interesting articles, do experiments, visit museums, make arguments, hear speakers, and just learn. What an enviable task!
I’m thankful for the increased awareness of mental health issues that has been brought to campus this year. Such efforts include a new workgroup on student stress, discussions with President Faust, and an event dedicated to sharing experiences with mental illness through art. It’s not infrequently that I find myself talking about some aspect of mental health over dinner with a friend—a testament to a changing climate at Harvard in which these important yet sensitive topics are no longer off limits.
I am thankful for the opportunity this past week to vote on three absolutely critical referenda in the Undergraduate Council election and to be part of a student body that is calling loudly for divestment from fossil fuels, reevaluation of our sexual assault policy, and creation of a social choice endowment fund. It is inspiring to be a part of student movements for a more sustainable, fair, equitable, and humane world.
I am thankful to be a student in one of the best cities in the country. I love riding the Red Line between Harvard and MIT, eavesdropping on some graduate student talking about his dissertation. I like running along the Charles and speculating about whether the guy running towards me is from Harvard, MIT, Tufts, Boston College, Boston University, or Northeastern. There’s something both comforting and energizing about being surrounded by so many students.
Thanksgiving isn’t the holiday for resolutions—that holiday is still coming. But with only a few weeks left of the semester, I am making a resolution. I am going to stop lamenting over life at Harvard. There are significant things we can do to improve student life here, and undoubtedly we should be continually working to do so. However, there are so many things we have to be thankful for. We will only enjoy our college experience to the fullest when we can embrace life at Harvard for all that it is, and it is awfully spectacular.

Ever since they took a major hit in the election three weeks ago, Republicans have been discussing how they will face the major demographic shifts that account, at least in part, for their losses. In short, the groups who have traditionally voted for Republicans in the last 20 years—white, older married people—are an increasingly smaller percentage of the population of the United States. Or, less tactfully, they are dying out. As one writer put it: “Contrary to much conventional wisdom, voters do not necessarily grow more conservative as they age; until the last decade, a majority of both younger and older voters both tended to go to the winner of the presidential election.” It’s only at this particular point in our country’s history that older people vote very differently—largely because they are more white, more married, and just plain old more conservative than younger Americans. Each year, fewer of these older people are around to vote.
So how will the Republicans adapt? Members of the Grand Old Party have offered different solutions for how this demographic change can be accommodated. Most have suggested changes to immigration reform policy in the platform to accommodate the increasing numbers of Latino voters; there has even been super-PAC money devoted to the issue. While this certainly makes sense as a step, it will hardly be enough on its own, not just because it only targets one alienated group, but also because, despite a reputation for being socially conservative, most Latinos actually self-identify as both economically and socially liberal on a variety of key issues. A Pew poll from this April found that Latino voters are more likely to identify as liberal than conservative. Although they are more likely to be religious and are more conservative about abortion, they are also more likely to prefer big government and be accepting of homosexuality than the average American.
Latinos are more likely to believe in the importance of hard work compared to their fellow Americans, even as they continue to favor more government involvement. This suggests that preferences for larger government have less to do with wanting “handouts”—higher living standards with less work—and instead reflect perceived benefits of big government that will help those who work hard, especially when it comes to greater economic security and regulation of industries. These are, in fact, increasingly important concerns among many voters, which is why Americans are more divided than ever on issues like environmentalism, support for labor unions, and a social safety net.
In any case, while shifts on immigration policy will probably make the Republican platform more appealing to Latinos, it is unlikely to win them over en masse—not just because Democrats already have a track record of instituting policies popular with Latinos, but also because Democrats more closely match Latino views beyond the issue of immigration.
Less discussed but even more relevant is the need for the Republican Party to appeal to women. While women are naturally not going to make up a different percentage of the population in the coming years, they have, for a variety of demographic reasons, become increasingly likely to vote compared to men. There has been some discussion of how to welcome women into the Republican Party: John McCain recently suggested that the party de-politicize its views on abortion. Although this might help in theory, it’s not so practical because the Republicans must placate a chunk of religious single-issue voters on abortion. Yet there are a variety of other issues about which women have distinct views, like wage discrimination, single parenthood, and the benefits of daycare. The GOP might make better headway in wooing women voters by supporting policies for fair pay or subsidized daycare programs like Head Start.
Although both of these concessions would be a shift toward larger government, they could also be recast as issues about fairness toward hard work and support for families, including single mothers who have chosen not to have abortions. The most right-wing Republicans might howl, but the independents might listen. There are doubtless women and Latinos who want certain kinds of smaller government—the GOP can think carefully about how to provide this while accommodating other concerns.

Earlier this year, Harvard joined with MIT to launch edX as a platform on which the universities could offer high-quality education to a population beyond the Charles River. At the time, we welcomed this demonstrable commitment to making learning accessible to a wider range of individuals. In this vein, we were excited to hear the recent news that the program has partnered with two Massachusetts community colleges to add an in-person component to its online courses in computer science.
In its brief history, edX has been in a period of constant expansion. So far, it has already broadened its reaches to include the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Texas. The recent involvement of Bunker Hill and MassBay Community Colleges proves that distance education need not be limited to four-year universities. In fact, we believe that edX has the ability to continue innovating in the realm of inclusive higher education.
Unfortunately, efforts to address the issues plaguing higher education in this country focus too often on four-year institutions. While the needs of these students are undoubtedly important, we must not forget those who, whether by choice or circumstance, attend schools of a different caliber. Community colleges, which offer two years of public education for community members, have a role to play in the evolving standards of American education.
Three years ago, President Obama proposed a $12-billion 10-year plan designed to produce five million new community college graduates. While the sputtering economic recovery impelled the president to modify his proposal to an $8-billion 3-year job training stopgap, it is heartening to see a leader who recognizes the value of the varied forms of higher education. Community colleges support an underserved clientele, and we commend any and all efforts to bolster the resources available to their administrators, teachers, and students.
The particulars of the edX partnership are also praiseworthy. While edX was initially rolled out as a limited selection of online course samplings, the new initiative pairs the virtual lectures with in-class instructors and personal mentors. While the future of education may reside on the World Wide Web, there remain undeniable benefits to an interactive learning environment. We recognize this as an unexpected and encouraging step in the progression of the still nascent program. It is impossible to predict with future of learning with total accuracy, and we appreciate the openness edX has shown toward innovation.
The future of the edX platform is bright, and we possess neither the insight nor the foresight to gauge its ultimate impact. We are excited about the wide range of possibilities it offers to a broadening population. When the program was announced, the process of disseminating knowledge changed for the better. This process is in constant transformation, and we eagerly look forward to finding out where it ends up. There is no doubt that Harvard and the edX program will have major roles to play in leading the way.

The 2012 presidential election has finally ended, and the principals involved have returned to their normal lives. For President Obama, of course, this means going back to his full-time job of governing the country, a task that, unsurprisingly, was put on the backburner in the weeks and months preceding Election Day. As Obama reacquaints himself with his old White House staff, he is also tasked with assembling a new team of associates to lead the country for the next four years. The position of Secretary of State in particular will require a deft and knowledgeable replacement capable of filling the large shoes currently worn by Hillary R. Clinton. Clinton, who has earned plaudits for her performance, announced last year that she would only stay in the post for a single administration, as is standard for Secretaries of State.
Political journalists have reported a shortlist for each of the positions in the second Obama administration’s Cabinet. For Secretary of State, the two frontrunners are United Nations Ambassador Susan E. Rice and Massachusetts Senator John Kerry. While both of these individuals are talented diplomats with impressive résumés, Senator Kerry stands out as the best choice to represent American interests abroad.
To most Americans, John Kerry is known first and foremost as a presidential loser from the Bay State, a similar characterization as the one that will eventually be applied to Mitt Romney. However, in nearly a decade since losing in 2004, Kerry has positioned himself as a leader in his party on issues relating to foreign policy. With the election of Joe Biden to the vice presidency, Kerry acceded to the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
In this capacity, Senator Kerry has established himself as an expert on American foreign policy issues. He has traveled throughout the world, serving as the administration’s unofficial envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Two years ago, he conducted the difficult task of representing American interests in the war-torn nation of Sudan, and he is credited for painstaking work in ensuring that country did not erupt into civil violence.
In the past four years, Kerry has also been a strong and loyal advocate for President Obama. This is worth quite a bit in Washington, as America’s chief diplomat should not sway from the president’s designed course. Kerry has supported Obama since day one. After all, we may very not have had a President Obama without Kerry’s selection of the unknown senatorial candidate to deliver his keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. That speech is often cited as the launch of Obama’s career.
Kerry’s fealty to the president was not a one-time affair. He was the first major endorser of candidate Barack Obama in 2008, providing necessary credibility to the Illinois Senator’s campaign against Hillary Clinton. It would not be at all undeserved if the president took it upon himself to return the favor and nominate Kerry for his Secretary of State.
In the current discussion of frontrunners for the position, it seems as if Kerry’s steadfast sponsorship of the Obama agenda will not be enough. Susan E. Rice is a member of the president’s inner circle, giving her a leg up on the competition. In addition, Ambassador Rice has an extensive résumé, beginning with her work in the Clinton White House of the early 1990s.
However, Rice has made several remarks detrimental to American interests during her tenure at the U.N. Her sharp tongue has been well documented over the years, and while a penchant for strong language does not put Ambassador Rice in the D.C. minority, it could have negative implications when directed at American partners abroad. For example, she raised the ire of Russia, whose relationship with the U.S. Kerry worked to rebuild, by saying our nation was “disgusted” with their “shameful” behavior. Russian diplomats have publicly expressed their preference for Kerry, noting Rice’s “ambitious and aggressive” manner. Ambition and aggression are necessary traits for surviving in Washington, where Rice, whose father was a governor of the Federal Reserve, was born and raised. However, a tendency to offend other countries does not necessarily make a candidate suited for international diplomacy.
Rice’s impulsive diplomatic style was also evident during and after the attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi a couple of months ago. When asked about the incident, Rice blamed a YouTube video for the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. She claimed the violence was the result of a spontaneous outburst of anti-Americanism rather than the premeditated act of terrorism turned out to be. At that point in time, her characterization of the event conflicted with U.S. lawmakers and the Libyan president, whose assertions were confirmed by former Central Intelligence Agency Director David Petraeus. One would hope that America’s Secretary of State would wait for all of information before making potentially damaging statements about events abroad.
The Obama administration’s decision on the next Secretary of State will demonstrate what traits it deems important when it comes to the face of U.S. diplomacy. The president has the opportunity to appoint a candidate with a proven track record and a history of supporting him, both personally and politically. It would be a shame if this remarkable career were forgotten due to Obama’s desire to promote a close friend. In that case, the interests of the United States would ultimately suffer.

Minorities lag in production and consumption of digital media, a worrisome trend as the media play an ever-growing role in society, a communications expert said Tuesday at a talk hosted by Harvard’s W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Studies.
In the first installment in a three-part lecture series, Ernest J. Wilson III ’70, the dean of the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California, spoke about the extent to which African-American, Asian, and Hispanic citizens are underrepresented as American society moves into a post-industrial era.
“We need to step away from daily clatter and Twitter and think of the class relationships, not just the latest gadget,” he said. He presented statistics to illustrate that minority participation in digital media has either remained stagnant or declined in recent years. For example, he said that in 2009, African-American people owned 1 percent of the nation’s commercial TV stations; today, they own 0.7 percent.
In a post-industrial world where communication is at the center of our daily lives, Wilson said, ownership and participation are becoming increasingly white and male.
Yet despite a lack of access to digital media, he said, minorities play a crucial role in the political sphere. He pointed to the fact that mobilization of minority voters was one of President Barack Obama’s main campaign strategies.
Henry Louis Gates Jr., director of Harvard’s W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research, introduced Wilson with an anecdote about how the two met while on a gap year in Africa.
Audience member Carla D. Martin ’03, a Harvard College Fellow in the African and African American studies department, said that Wilson’s talk lent itself well to the Du Bois Institute’s recent focus.
“[Gates has] been a pathbreaker in terms of doing things related to race online,” she said, mentioning recent initiatives by the Du Bois Institute to educate undergraduates about the presence of minorities in digital media. “I think [the events] will have a big impact.... Lectures such as this add fuel to the fire.”
The lecture series continues Wednesday and Thursday in the Barker Center at 4 p.m. It is free and open to the public, and a question-and-answer session and reception will follow each talk.

Tufts University administrator Leah Rosovsky ’78 will assume the role of vice president for strategy and programs at Harvard beginning in January, University President Drew G. Faust announced Tuesday.
Though her title will differ slightly, Rosovsky, a dean at Tufts School of Arts and Sciences, will fill the hole left by vice president for policy A. Clayton Spencer, who left Harvard earlier this year to become president of Bates College.
“I’m incredibly excited about doing this and getting the chance to work with President Faust and her team,” Rosovsky said in an interview with The Crimson. “The job is really about advancing the president’s strategic agenda and vision for the University.”
Rosovsky said she will work directly on Faust’s One University efforts, the University’s international initiatives, and continued efforts to attract top-level students and faculty across the University.
Rosovsky has been executive administrative dean at Tufts since 2006, where she has championed increases in financial aid and sophisticated budget planning.
She said she has been in conversation with Faust about the position for several months, and that she accepted the job in early November.
When she takes her place in Massachusetts Hall in January, Rosovsky will be returning to a University where she spent much of her professional career, first as an FAS fundraising officer and planner, and later as FAS associate dean for administrative planning.
“In returning to Harvard, Leah Rosovsky brings deep strategic expertise and an extraordinary breadth of accomplishment in higher education to this role,” Faust said in a statement. “She has proven to be adept at formulating and executing on high-level strategic objectives and at working with administrators and faculty to advance institutional goals.”
Rosovsky—who also holds a degree from Harvard Business School—said that her diverse experience at the University positions her well for the job.
“I learned an enormous amount at Harvard both as a student and then working there.... To be able to come back, to be a part of that, and to advance an agenda for an institution I feel so strongly about and have such strong ties to is really a rare opportunity,” she said.
Rosovsky is not the first in her family to serve as a Harvard administrator.
Her father Henry Rosovsky was a longtime Harvard professor and administrator. An expert in Japanese economic history, the elder Rosovsky was chair of the economics department from 1969 to 1972 and served as dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences from 1973 to 1984 and again from 1990 to 1991.
In 1984 and again in 1987, he served as acting president of the University. He became a member of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, in 1985.

Officials at the University of Chicago are collaborating with leaders of Harvard’s Institute of Politics as UChicago prepares to inaugurate its own IOP in January.
“We’ve been trying to help as much as we can,” said C. M. “Trey” Grayson ’94, director of the Harvard IOP.
At the start of this year, David M. Axelrod, former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, announced his plans to launch an organization at his alma mater in Chicago for students interested in public service careers.
Axelrod, who currently sits on the Senior Advisory Board of Harvard’s IOP, said that his new institute would be modeled after the existing one at Harvard.
Since then, leaders of Harvard’s IOP have reached out to help launch the Chicago program. Last spring, UChicago students and officials attended a conference to learn about Harvard’s IOP. And currently, the Harvard IOP is hosting Chicago IOP employees who are interested in reproducing Harvard’s fellows program.
Darren R. Reisberg, who was named the executive director of the Chicago program in May, said he hopes the cooperative relationship between the two organizations will continue.
“We already have very collegial and friendly relationships with our counterpart at Harvard’s [IOP],” Reisberg said. “I’d expect those to remain in place and for us to work together to think about the best ways to serve our students.”
Grayson, who added that Harvard’s IOP has inspired political institutes at other universities as well, said he thinks the partnership with UChicago is just as beneficial for Harvard’s IOP as it is for the fledgling program.
“There’s no competition, and what’s great is that we can learn a lot from other universities,” Grayson said. “We can communicate, work together, share ideas.”
Although the two institutes will share a bipartisan focus, Reisberg said that the Chicago IOP will differentiate itself by emphasizing urban politics and facilitating internships in city governance.
“My expectation is that, once we delve into our programming, once we formally launch, this institute will go in different directions based on the input of UChicago students and the UChicago community,” Reisberg said.
Reisberg said that the Chicago IOP has a twofold mission: to educate future civic leaders and to elevate UChicago’s status as a hub of political thought.
To achieve its first goal, the Chicago IOP will host forums and events to “provide a powerful supplement to the academic experience here at the University of Chicago by nurturing a passion for politics and public service on the part of the students,” Reisberg said.
To meet the second, Reisberg said he hopes to create an environment that will attract the thinkers and political heavyweights needed to enhance UChicago’s intellectual caliber.
“We want to be a destination point for politicians, policy leaders, and other public officials to come, convene, discuss, and resolve the issues of the day and the future,” Reisberg said.
Though the Chicago IOP, waiting for the completion of its building renovation, has yet to formally open its doors, it has already begun efforts to engage students.
In the past year, Reisberg said, the Institute has sponsored several events on campus, hosted watch parties for the presidential debates, and secured internships for students during last summer’s Republican and Democratic national conventions.
“We’re really excited to get going,” Reisberg said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Election outcomes have very significant policy consequences, but the election outcomes themselves are largely random,” Vanderbilt professor Larry M. Bartels declared.
Bartels used the annual social sciences lecture at the Radcliffe Institute on Tuesday to challenge commonly held beliefs about elections—all of which, he says, are false.
Throughout most of the talk, Bartels responded point by point to “The Responsible Electorate,” political scientist V.O. Key Jr.’s 1966 book that argues that the American electorate collectively makes rational decisions based on policy concerns. Bartels argued that the average American voter is instead uninformed about relevant policy issues during election cycles.
He pointed to evidence including a poll showing that only 40 percent of undecided voters this past summer knew that Republicans controlled the House of Representatives.
“There are very few people who decide what they think about the issue and then went out and voted for the guy [that campaigned on that issue],” he said, disputing Key’s assertion that the electorate votes based on policy issues.
Addressing the claim that, despite that lack of knowledge, the American electorate collectively arrives at a reliable decision because individual voters cancel out each other’s errors, he said that this assumption fails to consider that voters’ decisions influence other voters.
“People don’t sit in isolation and think about the political process unconnected to how everyone else is thinking about it,” he said.
Bartels said that his research, which focused on the issue of privatization of Social Security in the 2000 election, suggests that voters choose their preferred candidate independent of any policy concerns. Voters then adopt the policies that candidate supports, he said.
“Paying a lot of attention to the political process in our current political climate mostly consists of learning the talking points on your side of the partisan divide,” he said.
Bartels also countered the argument that the electorate’s decisions act as a referendum on the incumbent candidate.
He said his research suggests that much of the electorate decides whom to vote for based on short-term conditions in the months leading up to the elections, with little regard to the overall performance of the past administration.
Radcliffe Dean Lizabeth Cohen introduced Bartels’ lecture as an opportunity to reflect on the 2012 election from an academic perspective.“
Now that the outcome has been decided and journalists have moved on to other stories, the election belongs to scholars,” Cohen said. “Today’s lecture is a good way to launch this next stage of deeper analysis.”

What will motivate children more: a text message saying, “Be as good as you can be” or one saying, “List three ways that you can become a better person”?
Psychology professor Ellen J. Langer is betting on the latter. She plans to test this hypothesis by conducting a study on power texting—the exchange of motivational text messages—in conjunction with the BEM Foundation.
The BEM Foundation, a nonprofit organization whose name stands for Believe Every Moment, coined the term “power texting” to describe its unconventional mentoring program. The organization pairs inner-city youth in the Washington, D.C., area with adult mentors who send their mentees power texts on a regular basis.
“Professionals are busy and don’t have time,” said BEM co-founder Ronald Mitchell. “This will allow you to mentor a kid and make it so simple, so easy, that it will take 40 seconds of your time.”
Mentors in the program log on to a website, choose an inspirational message from a drop-down menu, personalize it, and send it to their mentees.
The inspirational messages range from straightforward advice such as “Study hard and study long” to compliments like “How does it feel to be brilliant and cool? Have a great day.”
Langer said she believes she can improve the effectiveness of these text messages by drawing on her theory of mindfulness—the process of actively noticing new things, relinquishing preconceived notions, and then acting on new observations.
She claims that mindfulness coincides with lower stress levels and a decline in negative evaluations of oneself and of others.
As part of her study, Langer plans to send “mindful texts” to one group of BEM mentees, while a control group will receive BEM’s current stock messages.
Langer and her research team have drafted mindful texts that include messages such as, “Try to notice five good things about your teacher” and “Think of three situations in which it would be good to not look cool.”
Langer said she expects that the group receiving mindful texts will show more marked improvement in both academic performance and overall wellbeing.
Mitchell said he is thrilled to be working with Langer. He said he hopes to use her research, which he described as “brilliant,” to make a greater impact on youth in his program.
“We can rely on her theory, mobile technology, and [the BEM Foundation],” Mitchell said. “Merge them, and we can make a phenomenal impact.”

World-famous French pastry chef Pierre Hermé shared a selection of his best pastries with more than 300 guests last night at the Harvard Graduate School of Design.
Speaking through an interpreter, Hermé described his creative baking process from inception to completion to an audience of students and Cantabrigians.
“If you want to be creative, you have to know the classics as a basis,” Hermé said.
He added that it took him years to move beyond baking staples and begin imagining his own creations.
Midway through Hermé’s presentation, each of the attendees received a tray bearing pastries created by Hermé and his staff. Attendees were directed to eat each treat in turn as Hermé described them.
Some desserts were unique variations on classics, such as rose, lychee, and raspberry macaroons. Another selection—a creamy concoction that tasted of wasabi with a bitter aftertaste—drew mixed reviews.
“It was an interesting mixture of different flavors such as sweetness, bitterness, and wasabi. It starts to dance in your mouth,” School of Design student Jielu Lu said.
Others were less impressed by the unconventional mix of flavors.
“It wasn’t my favorite—I associate wasabi with sushi, so it made me think of fish,” School of Design student Julia Xiao said. “It’s just a matter of personal taste.”
Hermé’s style is to use unique flavors in many of his creations to unsettle customers.
Hermé said he uses “a lot of things from the savory world not so much for taste, but for surprise.”
Many attendees were School of Design students looking for insight into Hermé’s creative process.
“I came because I liked the idea of looking at architecture in terms of dessert,” Lu said.
Speaking of his own minimalist aesthetic style, Hermé defended his decision not to decorate his creations, but instead focus on structure and taste.
“This comes back to the question of style, going back to the essentials.” Hermé said. “To not decorate the cakes, they have to be appetizing just by the elements that compose the cake.”
But Hermé suggested that the connections between pastry and architectural design do have their limits.
When a student asked how to emulate some of the pastry design concepts using the medium of architecture, Hermé said the process is “not at all something analogous.”
Still, attendees said they were satisfied with Hermé’s presentation.
“To watch the famed Hermé speak about his process of creation and, obviously, to taste his creations proved to be a delectable evening,” Xiao said.

With 1:32 to play in Tuesday night’s contest at Lavietes Pavilion, sophomore wing Wesley Saunders stole the ball on the Crimson’s full court press and found rookie point guard Siyani Chambers. The freshman quickly drew a foul and knocked down both of his free throw attempts to pull the Harvard men’s basketball team within three points of the Vermont.
But that was as close as Harvard would come to a victory, as the Catamounts pulled away to secure the win, 85-78.
On the next possession, Vermont guard Sandro Carissimo—who finished the game with a career-high 25 points on 8-of-11 shooting—knocked down an open three pointer to push his team’s lead back up to six at 81-75 with 1:17 remaining in the game.
From there, it was all free throws. Vermont knocked down four-of-six from the line to close the game.
The Crimson struggled from the free throw line all night, knocking down just 21-of-32 attempts, a mark of 66 percent.
Harvard entered the second half down, 48-34, but quickly climbed back into the game with a run that included two three-pointers in the first three minutes of the frame.
Harvard led the Catamounts, 13-9, after 4:17 in the first half, but a 9-0 Vermont run in the following 4:14 gave the visitors a lead it would not relinquish for the remainder of the half.
The Catamounts shot 73 percent from the field in the opening frame, knocking down 19-of-26 attempts and six of nine from three-point range.
Saunders led the Crimson with a career-high 21 points.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off back-to-back conference victories this past weekend, including an upset win against No. 3 Cornell, the No. 6/5 Harvard women’s hockey team (7-1-0, 6-0-0 ECAC) had no time to rest, travelling to take on No. 9 Northeastern (8-4-2, 4-3-1 WHEA) Tuesday night.
“It was a hard fought weekend,” co-captain Jillian Dempsey said.  “Maybe there was a little bit of tiredness.  This is the first time in the season when we had a Friday, Saturday, Tuesday turnaround.”
Posting a goal in all three frames, the Crimson earned a 3-1 win against the Huskies. Despite more than 30 shots on goal, the team could not find the same spark that it had the weekend before.
“Honestly, this was not necessarily our best game of hockey,” junior forward Lyndsey Fry said. “Obviously, we are really happy we pulled out a win. But I think coming off such a high from the weekend, I think we need to be more careful next time not to get ahead of ourselves.”
Even with the win, Harvard felt that its performance on the ice was not up to last weekend’s standards. The climactic win over Cornell, followed by the quick turnaround to Tuesday night’s game, resulted in disappointing play on both ends of the ice.
“What we were really missing was just beating them to pucks and just going full speed all the time,” Dempsey said. “We backed off a lot and gave them a little more room, whereas the other night [against Cornell], we were on top of them. Cornell didn’t have a second to breathe. We had pressure right in their face, every single time they got the puck. Tonight, it was inconsistent.”
Dempsey, the reigning ECAC Player of the Week, led the Crimson’s offensive charge, tallying both a goal and an assist on the night.
On the defensive end, goalkeeper Emerance Mashmeyer, who earned both Rookie of the Week and Goaltender of the Week honors over the weekend, put up 15 saves on the night.  The freshman is the only goaltender in the ECAC who still holds a perfect win percentage.
“You’re not always going to win pretty,” Dempsey said. “Sometimes you have to win ugly. You’re not always going be 100 percent.  It was one of those nights where things weren’t clicking exactly the right way.  We didn’t have our same drive and urgency on every play.”
But Harvard still managed the better offensive showing of the two teams. In the first period, the Crimson took the first shot on net and continued to put pressure on Northeastern, outshooting its opponent 9-5 in the frame. Forward Miye D’Oench gave Harvard an early lead, nabbing an unassisted goal for the Crimson nine minutes into the period. It was the freshman’s second career goal.
Harvard took its 1-0 advantage into the second period and controlled offensive possession of the puck, outshooting its opponent 8-1 in the first five minutes of the frame. The Crimson racked up 35 shots on the night, compared to the Huskies’ 16.
At 5:26, junior forward Kalley Armstrong found the back of the net to give Harvard a 2-0 lead. Armstrong’s goal was assisted by Fry and Dempsey.
Just over 11 minutes into the second frame, a holding penalty sent senior defender Kelsey Romatoski to the box. Northeastern capitalized on its one-man advantage, as junior forward Katie MacSorley scored with 34 seconds left in the power play.
But Dempsey picked up her eighth goal of the season off an assist from Fry to regain the Crimson’s two-goal advantage.  The junior now sits tied for third in goals scored in the conference standings.
Harvard mounted one last offensive charge at the end of regulation, posting seven shots on net in the final minute.  None converted, and the game ended in a 3-1 decision.
“If nothing else, what these games are doing for us is constantly building confidence,” Fry said. “It’s good to know we are on the uphill all the time, getting better every day.  We pulled away with the win.  We are going to keep pushing and getting better.”
Despite the less than stellar play, the Crimson managed to put away its top-10 opponent.
“It just wasn’t Harvard hockey tonight,” Dempsey said. “[But] I’m glad and I’m proud that we were able to dig down deep and even not having our best, be able to beat a strong team like Northeastern. That says something too.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With 64 surgeries, two years at Harvard, and a Paralympic Games under her belt, visually impaired alpine skier and premed student Caitlin Sarubbi never expected that being asked to dissect a cat in class would be what finally made her question her abilities.
Sarubbi was born with Ablepharon Macrostomia Syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that rendered her legally blind and subjected her to repeated reconstructive surgeries as a child. The oldest of five, Sarubbi grew up doing everything her siblings did.
But when she came face-to-face with the cat in a class, Sarubbi realized she could not do the dissection. For the first time in her life, she wondered if her vision was an obstacle that she could not overcome.
“I had this vision from birth, which I think makes it a little easier because I don’t know what 20-20 is,” Sarubbi explained. “I forget that I’m visually impaired. I’m not going to sit there and wallow because it is what it is.”
Sarubbi is a social and cognitive neuroscience concentrator who attributes her interest in being a doctor to the advances in medicine that saved her life as a child. She currently ranks in the top 10 among visually impaired skiers worldwide in all five alpine events.
At the end of the fall semester, she will take a year and a half off to train and compete in the 2014 Paralympic Games in Sochi, Russia, before coming back to Harvard to finish her undergraduate degree and pursue medical school.
“I don’t want to wake up 10 years down the road and regret not trying to be a doctor,” Sarubbi said. “I would rather try it now and see if it’s possible.”
PULLING THE TRIGGER
After Sarubbi met with an academic counselor earlier this month, she knew that it was time to make a decision and that it was not going to be an easy one.
“I had been going back and forth on Sochi for the last two and a half years,” Sarubbi said. “I just needed to pull the trigger. I’m at the point right now where I have the luxury of being able to be a skier for a year and a half and travel, but this is the last time. I can’t do it when I have a family and a career.”
Sarubbi has not raced since 2010, when she took an academic leave and froze her points to maintain her ranking on the world stage. Her sister Jamie, a sophomore at Notre Dame who is taking a year off from school to train and compete with Sarubbi as her guide, will join her at the end of the spring semester. Until then, Sarubbi will train and race with Jimmy Lawrence, a ski instructor who worked with the Sarubbi family at Windham Mountain Ski Resort in Windham, N.Y.
“I’m just going to race like I normally would, and she is going to follow me,” Lawrence said. “I just know I have to lay off the gates so that they don’t hit her when I go by them.”
The road to Sochi 2014 will not be easy. Sarubbi is coming into the beginning of the season with no training and a brand new guide, and she is working on a significantly lower budget than last time around, using an online profile on RallyMe.com to raise money. Still, Sarubbi and her family say they want her story to be heard.
“If I had heard a story like Caitlin’s when she was born 22 years ago, my thoughts wouldn’t have been so heavy at the beginning,” said Cathy Sarubbi, who  said she wholeheartedly supports her daughter’s decision to go to the Paralympics. “She’s in her Caitlin mode now. Full speed ahead and nothing stopping her.”
IF I CAN DO THIS, I CAN DO ANYTHING
Sarubbi had never been on skis until 2001, and her involvement in community sports was the extent of her athletic career. But everything changed after Sept. 11, 2001, when her father John—a NYC firefighter—was contacted by several organizations who wanted to honor the first responders.
Among the organizations that reached out to the family was Disabled Sports USA, a foundation committed to helping people with disabilities live a fulfilled life through athletics with the motto, “If I can do this, I can do anything.”
The organization invited the Sarubbi family to a weeklong, all-expenses-paid ski trip to Breckinridge, Colo. The family fell in love with the organization, which has a local chapter called the Adaptive Sports Foundation in Windham, N.Y.
“When Caitlin started skiing at ASF, we started to volunteer there,” Cathy said. “The whole family gives back to the organization because now Caitlin’s story gets to be told.”
With the help of ASF, Sarubbi learned to ski with a guide who she follows down the mountain and communicates with through helmet walkie-talkies. Starting as a junior in high school, she took on a full racing schedule that she tried to balance with her coursework and college applications.
BEST WEEK EVER
In the spring of 2008, Sarubbi’s hard work paid off in what she emphatically calls the best week of her life. She had applied to Harvard not expecting to get in, so that the acceptance letter came as a shock, she said.
“She opened up the wrapping paper and saw the envelope, and the tears just start coming down her face,” Cathy said. “It was like all that hard work just came together. I’ll never forget that day in my life.”
Sarubbi had only received the first of what happened to be a week full of good news. Just two days later, she received another envelope, this one from the USA Paralympic Team, inviting her to compete in Vancouver.
“That year I was five-time national champ and overall national champ, so I knew that I had a good shot at making the team,” Sarubbi said. “The Harvard letter was way more of a shock and surprise, and a gift. To have them both pay off at the same time was pretty awesome.”
Although she had balanced racing and academics in high school, Sarubbi knew it was not sustainable in college. She met with Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, who approved Sarubbi’s plan to attend Harvard for one semester and take the next year and a half off to compete in the Paralympics.
In Sarubbi’s first Paralympic games, she raced in all five alpine events, bringing home two sixth-place finishes and one eighth-place mark. Sarubbi—who is required to ski with a guide—said she struggled to find the right person to work with.
“When she went to the first Paralympics, other athletes were husband and wife or lifelong friends,” Jamie said. “You have to have that trust and that communication. Her past two guides didn’t see her as a person, just more as an athlete.”
MY SISTER’S KEEPER
Jamie—the second oldest of the five Sarubbi siblings—is trained as an adaptive ski instructor and started working with Sarubbi last year. She said that the decision to take a leave of absence from college was not a hard one because she grew up so close to her older sister.
“Instead of her watching over me and protecting me, I felt that a lot of times I was kind of watching over her and protecting her,” Jamie said. “Going to the park, I would hold her hand and make sure she didn’t trip on anything.”
As the sisters grew older—and Sarubbi continued to excel—Jamie began to see her sister differently, a subject that she addresses in a book she wrote, titled ‘Through My Sister’s Eyes.’
“It went from me protecting her and having her follow me, to me seeing everything she accomplished and being in awe of her,” Jamie said. “Despite all the adversity she’s faced, she’s managed to be this amazing athlete and go to this amazing school, and she’s doing it all by herself.”
Jamie—a volunteer instructor at Windham—learned to guide and attended a camp with her sister last year. While the two will need more training to work out the technical details, it was clear that the connection was instant.
“[Sarubbi] said that when we first started out last year, we were at a level of being in sync without even trying,” Jamie said. “She said she never even had that after training for months with her old guide.”
Indeed, skiing with her sister is going to be a radically different experience than her time in Vancouver. The two will eat, sleep, and train together in the months leading up to the Paralympic Games. While both Jamie and Sarubbi agree that they are opposites—Sarubbi is outgoing and Jamie is the quiet one—the two are looking forward to spending time together.
“If we fight, it’s no big deal because we’re sisters, and we fight all the time,” Sarubbi said, laughing. “It will give us a chance to hang out and travel and have fun.”
Although Cathy jokes that she just wants her two daughters to graduate and get jobs, she said she is happy that Sarubbi will have a guide who is there for more than just the competition.
“Jamie doesn’t care about a medal or the podium,” Cathy said. “Jamie just loves Caitlin, and she loves to ski. She’s doing it for the right reasons.”
A FAMILY AFFAIR
If you ask Sarubbi about her experience in Vancouver, she will not talk about where she finished or how she got along with her guide. Rather, the first thing she wants the world to know is that over the course of 12 days of competition, she had over 30 family members come out in support.
“Those were the most nerve-wracking races of my career,” Sarubbi remembered. “Just to have them there, I was able to separate myself from being an athlete for a few hours a day. It kept me balanced.”
The Sarubbi family has supported her since birth, taking her to doctor after doctor and surgery after surgery. They remortgaged the house to go to Vancouver and rented a house at the bottom of the mountain where Sarubbi would be racing.
“It was never daunting to have to take care of her,” Cathy said. “She has accomplished so much; it’s daunting for my other kids. They have to work so hard to keep up with Caitlin, and they know how blessed they are, and we take nothing for granted.”
While Sarubbi was deciding whether to train for Sochi, her New York home was hit by Hurricane Sandy, and she flew home to help with the cleanup. Cathy attributes the family’s strength to her daughter’s remarkable survival.
“We lost a lot of stuff, but we’ll start over,” Cathy said. “We’re so thankful for what we have been given because we didn’t know if Caitlin was going to live the night, and 22 years later she’s pretty much a rock star.”

With 1:32 to play in Tuesday night’s contest at Lavietes Pavilion, sophomore wing Wesley Saunders stole the ball on the Crimson’s full court press and passed to rookie point guard Siyani Chambers. The freshman quickly drew a foul and knocked down both of his free throw attempts to put the Harvard men’s basketball team within three points of a Catamounts squad that had amassed a 14-point lead at the half.
But that was as close as the Crimson (2-3) would come to a victory, as Vermont (4-1, 1-0 America East) pulled away to secure the win, 85-78.
“We made great headway [and] effort to try to get back into [the game] in the second half,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “But that kind of hole to a team that was playing as well as they were playing made it very difficult.”
On the next possession, Catamounts’ guard Sandro Carissimo—who finished the game with a career-high 25 points on 8-of-11 shooting, including four-of-five from behind the arc—knocked down a wide open three-pointer to push his team’s lead back up to six with 1:17 remaining in the game.
From there, it was all free throws. Vermont knocked down four of six from the line to finish the contest, and despite adding three points on a Chambers layup and a single foul shot from co-captain Christian Webster, Harvard could not close the gap.
“I give [Vermont] a lot of credit,” Amaker said. “I think they played well for 40 minutes, and I think we played well for maybe 22 minutes.”
The Crimson struggled from the charity stripe throughout the game, knocking down just 21 of 32 attempts, including a dismal 9-for-17 in the first half. Webster had a particularly tough night at the line, adding just one point in six free throw attempts.
Harvard made it a two-point game with 11:06 to play on a Webster three from the top of the key, but six straight points from the Catamounts, all on free throws, pushed the game just out of reach once again.
The Crimson entered the second half down 48-34 but quickly climbed back into the game with an 18-7 run in the opening 6:33 that included two three pointers from junior co-captain Laurent Rivard in the first three minutes of the frame.
“We got off to a slow start,” Saunders added. “We kind of picked it up in the second half, but we kind of got ourselves into a hole. We have a lot of stuff we need to work on, so we just have to keep working to get better.”
Rivard—who was four-of-nine from three-point range—was one of three Crimson players to score in double digits. Saunders led the team with 21 points, while Chambers chipped in 16 and a team-high eight assists.
But while Harvard’s offense posted its second-highest point total of the season—just one point behind its total in the 79-45 rout of Manhattan on Nov. 16—its defense struggled to stall the Vermont offense, giving up the highest number of points since a 93-71 loss to Appalachian State on March 17, 2010.
“It really wasn’t one of our better defensive performances,” Amaker said. “We’ve been a very good defensive team, so it was alarming for us to have them shoot the way they did in the first half.”
Harvard led the Catamounts, 13-9, after 4:17 in the first half, but a 9-0 run in the following 3:19 gave Vermont a lead it would not relinquish.
Vermont shot an impressive 73 percent from the field in the opening frame, knocking down 19 of 26 attempts and six-of-nine from three-point range.
“I don’t think we were ready to play from the beginning [of the game],” Saunders said. “Once we did get ready to play, we were too far behind, and it was hard to catch up.”
The Crimson—which finished the night 9-of-16 from behind the arc—attempted just three long-range shots in the first half. Webster made Harvard’s first three-point attempt of the game with 4:41 left to play. After two more makes in the final five minutes of play from Rivard, the Crimson was a perfect three-for-three from deep heading into the break.
With the loss, the Crimson drops to below .500 for the first time in this young season.
“Coming into [the season], we knew it was going to be a tough road for us,” Amaker said. “We knew with this game and other games, we’re playing some really good teams…. We need to find out if we can hold our spirit together, if we can hold our confidence. I think that will be very key for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past two seasons, the Harvard men’s basketball team’s enormous level of success has been in large part based on two factors—stingy defense and accurate free-throw shooting.
The Crimson was fourth in the country in team defense last season and second in free-throw percentage in 2010-11—the two most successful campaigns in program history.
But in Tuesday night’s 85-78 loss to Vermont at Lavietes Pavilion, the Crimson struggled in both areas, making clear for the second consecutive game that this year’s squad still has a long way to go to match the success its predecessors achieved the past two years.
The 85 points Harvard allowed was the most it surrendered in a regular-season game since a Dec. 23, 2009 loss to Georgetown. After not allowing more than 70 points in a regular-season contest last season, the Crimson has done so in two consecutive games after it fell to St. Joseph’s, 75-56, a week ago.
“That’s been one of the calling cards of our program and our team—to be able to defend—and certainly we didn’t do that as well as we needed to tonight,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
That was especially true in the first half, as the Catamounts took a 48-34 lead into the break by shooting 73 percent from the floor.
“We couldn’t get stops,” Amaker said. “We didn’t do well in ball screen coverage.... They broke us down and from there opened up the floor, got in the seams.”
“A lot of the time they were popping out of pick and rolls,” sophomore wing Wes Saunders added.
While preventing Harvard from getting off a three-point attempt until there were less than five minutes to go in the first half, Vermont shot six-of-nine from long distance, helping it score 36 more points than the Crimson has allowed on average at home this year.
“They got so much confidence from the plays they were making off the ball screen,” Amaker said. “Once they saw that was a sore spot for us, they stayed with it, so credit to them for making those plays.”
FREE FALLIN’
In many ways, the game was determined at the free-throw line, where Harvard shot just 65.6 percent, missing 11 of 32 attempts.
“We usually make free throws,” Saunders said. “It was just an off night.”
Co-captain Christian Webster—who was 13th in the nation after shooting 89.4 percent from the charity stripe two seasons ago—missed his first five attempts from the line and finished one-for-six.
At the other end of the court, Vermont took 26 free throws and made 80.8 percent of them. That success helped the Catamounts hand Harvard just its second loss in its last 32 games at Lavietes Pavilion.
“[Free throws were] another thing that [was] alarming for us because we’ve been a very good foul shooting team,” Amaker said. “When you’re struggling [to score] and get to the foul line, you want to cash in and stop runs, and it didn’t [happen] for us.”
GO SIYA WES-TERN
Though Harvard struggled defensively and at the line, Saunders and freshman point guard Siyani Chambers chipped in career scoring highs on the offensive end.
The sophomore registered 21 points on 7-of-12 shooting, while Chambers contributed 16 points, to go with eight assists.
Chambers’ and Saunders’ 15 and 12 second half points, respectively, helped bring the Crimson back into the game in the second period, when it outscored Vermont by seven.
The pair did all of Harvard’s scoring on a 12-3 run early in the half that got the Crimson within three at 55-52. Saunders hit one of two free throws, then had a steal and transition dunk off a Chambers assist. The rookie then hit a three and found Saunders off of penetration for another long ball before Saunders returned the favor by kicking out to Chambers for a third three.
That shot put Harvard at 5-of-6 from long distance, but the Crimson hit only one more of its attempts from behind the arc for the rest of the night, helping Vermont stave off a Harvard comeback attempt.
Nonetheless, Amaker was pleased with the performance of his two talented starters.
“I thought [Siyani] played exceptionally well,” Amaker said. “And [without much depth], we need Wesley to do a lot more for this team, and he’s capable of it. You see that in his performance, and how efficient he’s been.”

This winter, you might want to save your holiday shopping for after finals period. Researchers from Harvard and other universities have found that sadness (a common condition among students trying to finish papers and projects at the end of the semester) not only leads to increased spending, it also impacts the quality of our financial decisions.
Jennifer Lerner, of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, and her colleagues have identified a condition called "myopic misery," in which the sad participants of a study stated that they would rather receive up to 34 percent less money now than a larger amount later. You don't need to be in Math 55a to know that's terrible financing.
December is a trying time: we have to shrug off Thanksgiving sluggishness, confront the cold, deal with finals, and, perhaps worst of all, find perfect, thoughtful presents for all those friends and family members back home. Lerner's study doesn't provide any solutions to myopic misery, so Flyby has stepped up to the plate to ensure that our precious cash doesn’t suddenly transform into empty Insomnia Cookie wrappers. Here are some ways to keep your spirits up before hitting the Square for holiday shopping.
 
One Direction, T-Swift, and PSY are your best buds. Admit it. Your iTunes library may be filled with some truly great music, but at the end of the day, nothing makes you happier than watching Gangnam Style (or better yet, the US Navy's version). Before you embark on your shopping excursion, listen to some 1D, laugh at their tracks, and get in a lighter mood.
 
Revel in free TV. First Harvard grants us Tivli, but now we have free HBO GO? We all need to take a moment and pat ourselves on the back—not only have we tricked Dean Fitzsimmons into letting us go here, we've somehow also finagled free HBO. That's a job well done. Take in some "Sex and the City" or an episode of "The Sopranos" and set off—when you don't have to pay for procrastination, you are unstoppable.
 
Divided We Fall. You've been saying since the beginning of freshman year that you'd like to "explore Boston." Well, get your act together—try kidnapping your blockmates and ride the T into the great unknown. Holiday shopping doesn't have to be such an ordeal if you and your friends are out and about in Boston together.
 
And voila! Now we will never fall ill to myopic misery, and only make the best financial decisions—it's a Christmas miracle.

On Tuesday, the Massachusetts Secretary of State certified what most people around the country already knew: the Bay State is weird. Even as the rest of the country showed near-record apathy on Election Day, Massachusetts voters came out in droves.
 
According to Secretary of State William F. Galvin, 3,184,196 people cast their ballots in the Bay State on Election Day—73.3 percent of registered voters. That's up slightly from the previous record of 3,102,995 who came out to vote in 2008. Much of that high turnout is attributed to the highly competitive U.S. Senate race between Senator Scott Brown and former Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren. The popularity of both candidates and Warren's unprecedented "Get Out the Vote" efforts combined to generate a wave of electoral participation. Or maybe voters were just excited about the chance to legalize medical marijuana? Galvin said that measure, which passed on Election Day, will come into effect January 1.

This time it's for real, in all kinds of ways. 
After a preemptive round of No Subject emails landed in students' inboxes yesterday from the suspiciuos sender "registration@worldapp.com," The Office of Student Life has done its best to put this botched attempt at undergraduate opinion gathering behind it and move on to bigger and/or less sketchy things.
Today the OSL is back and better than ever, and they want you to know that the survey will not eat your computer alive. The most recent, far more official-looking email, which came from osl-adm@fas.harvard.edu and had a subject line reading "House Life Survey 2012-13" (see what they did there?!) is signed by Kim Pacelli, Associate Dean of Student Life and Karen Pearce, Director of Harvard College Institutional Research. Pacelli and Pearce write: "In an effort to clarify and address concerns about the validity of the survey and the safety of the link, we now invite you to participate in the survey by visiting the Office of Student Life's webpage." Legit, right?
Almost. It's still the OSL, so of course they have to get something wrong. This now "valid" survey asks students if they belong to "Finals" Clubs—yes, finals plural—reminding us once and for all just how in touch they are with the lives of Harvard students (answer: not much).
Speaking of finals: In other, perhaps even more frightening news, the Q evaluation is now officially open, a sure sign that the semester itself is officially (almost) over and that final papers and exams (and maybe even the apocalypse) are upon us. It's okay, though. According to their email, the Course Evaluation Staff are "wishing [us] all the best." It may be insincere, but at least we know it's not spam!
