After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Decked out in a bright orange and green tracksuit with matching chunky sunglasses, Portland-native Aminé brought an unapologetically positive energy to Rolling Loud Miami’s day two lineup. Accompanied by his tour DJ Madison LST, who spun everything from a Spice Girls throwback to a “Drop It Like It’s Hot” sample, Aminé’s set was a true block-party — brimming with two-steps, colorful lights, and dripping sweat, because damn, Miami “is hot as a bitch, innit?”
Due to an 8:15 p.m. set time directly before crowd-favorites Latto, Polo G, and Dababy, many of the audience members who had pushed their way to the barricades were only somewhat familiar with Aminé, choosing to slink through and stake out in preparation for the later performers. While a few die-hard fans matched Aminé bar-for-bar, some even hanging over the barricade for the chance to make eye contact with the rapper, others chose to just “bop” — as he encouraged everyone to do — before chiming in for his most popular songs. Like on the U.S. leg of his most recent tour, “Best Tour Ever,” Aminé performed “Spice Girl,” “RED MERCEDES,” and a slowed-down version of “Caroline,” complete with his trademark catchphrase: “If you ain’t Black don’t say it.”
The crowd’s unfamiliarity with his songs didn’t stop Aminé from putting on an amazing performance full of fanservice. For long-time fans of the musician, watching his set felt like a journey through his artistic development. While he included songs from his newest album “TWOPOINTFIVE” — which he only recently finished touring in the U.S earlier this year — like “Mad Funny Freestyle” and “meant2b,” he didn’t shy away from tapping into the archives of his discography. In performing throwbacks like “Yellow,” a song that personifies an upbeat acknowledgement of his newly found musical success from his 2017 debut album, “Good For You,” Aminé reminded his listeners of how far he has come in the past five years.

No one present at Hard Rock Stadium could deny that Aminé simply had fun onstage that day. Armed with his signature one-legged hop and arm pump, Aminé’s energy was infectious. From Aminé asking the cameraman to “show them how the sweat is like, glistening on my body right now" to yelling “you’re beautiful” to the crowd — to which they would respond “I know!” — the set never had a dull moment. As readers can see in Rolling Loud’s official livestream of the performance, hands were always up and bouncing.
The groovier and bass-heavy tempo of Aminé’s discography facilitated one of the tamer crowds of the weekend. Even though spectators jumped, yelled lyrics, and occasionally moshed — particularly when Aminé realized he only had one song left and urged concert-goers to get “every mosh pit live in this motherfucker, but be safe” before playing “REEL IT IN” — the energy never felt too chaotic. Unlike the notably intense crowds for Playboi Carti, who Carti himself has even called a “Cult,” onlookers for Aminé experienced unadulterated fun.
As Aminé kicks off the second leg of his “Best Tour Ever” throughout Europe in early September, consider listening to both his recent and older projects. There is officially one year left until Rolling Loud Miami strikes again and in case Aminé finds his way onto the line up once more, it’s time to hit that play button.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Few musicians are as dedicated to putting on a show as Kendrick Lamar proved himself to be at Rolling Loud Miami this past weekend. The 35-year-old rapper from Compton closed out the three-day festival with a cinematic bang of a setlist, weaving a cohesive narrative through both his acting and rapping. Simply put, Lamar delivered a once in a lifetime, truly unforgettable show for Miami on Sunday.
Wearing a crown of thorns, Lamar stepped out on stage as the visual embodiment of his 2022 album “Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers.” The costume was a reference to his latest album’s artwork and represents a study in religious imagery and artistic depictions of “hood philosophies,” according to creative collaborator Dave Free. Despite these larger than life allusions, Lamar’s lyrics made it clear that his persona was a mimetic allegory for his personal struggle and perseverance rather than personification of a savior figure. In performing songs like “Savior,” for example, Lamar points out that great artists — J.Cole, Future, and himself — are just human. “The cat is out the bag, I am not your savior / I find it just as difficult to love thy neighbors,” the rapper told Miami with accompanying vocals from Baby Keem and Sam Dew, calling out those who hold him up to God-like standards.
As the concert kicked off with “N95,” the stage flooded with backup dancers clothed in jumpsuits and face masks — a nod to the Covid-related tropes in the song’s lyrics. Lamar himself took part in the acting, guiding the audience like an orchestral conductor during the introductory lines “Hello, new world, all the boys and girls / I got some true stories to tell.” The choreographed stage continued to act like a living, breathing extension of his lyrics, as the dancers marched to “N95”’s lyrics “You steppin' or what?;” moshed on stage for the chorus of “m.A.A.d city;” and stood still to the melody of “ELEMENT,” closing in all around Lamar like the crowd of haters he’s rapping about.
Every aspect of his stage design contributed to the narrative, down to the LED display, which illustrated transition slides for “Kendrick Have A Dream” into “Backseat Freestyle,” “Rich Spirit, Broke Phone” into “Rich Spirit,” and “Compton, USA” into “m.A.A.d city.” The live camera feed displayed behind him, shot from multiple angles with a movie-like sepia filter, cutting in and out to the beat, only further contributed to the cinematic, audio-visual experience of Lamar’s set. These displays served to both structure the set chronologically as well as to get the audience hyped up before the next song’s beat drop.
The technicality of Lamar’s rapping amazed the crowd, who watched in awe as the multiple Grammy award-winning artist effortlessly switched between tracks, taking no time for a breather between the breakneck flows in “King Kunta” and “LOYALTY,” for example.
The high energy of his delivery was matched by the crowd, with multiple mosh pits forming to the deep thrum of 808s. The excitement escalated when Lamar brought out Kodak Black to perform their song “Silent Hill.” The crowd went wild at the sight of these two legends on the same stage for the first time ever — especially since Black is a South Florida native. Crucially, the performance also came after Lamar faced backlash from some fans for including Black on the album in light of the rapper’s rape and sexual assault charges that resulted from a 2021 sexual assault case and subsequent plea deal. (Black was later granted commutation by then-president Donald Trump.)
Still, Lamar made sure to make the rapper feel welcomed, even getting him to do a couple of dance moves to the chorus.
That wasn’t the last guest appearance Sunday’s crowd saw; “Everybody! Energy!” shouted Lamar’s cousin Baby Keem as he returned to the stage to perform “Family Ties” for the second time that day. Many speculations were circulating throughout the day that Lamar would bring out his cousin and touring partner. The anxious crowd got exactly what they wanted in an explosive performance that proved why the song took home the trophy for Best Rap Performance at the 64th Grammy Awards.
“I go by the name of K.Dot, Kendrick Lamar, Oklama. I love y’all,” Lamar said at one point.
Switching between the personas of past albums, Lamar executed a musically chronological performance that represented his journey and growth as an artist. While K.Dot from 2017’s “DAMN.” focuses on spitting bars to prove his ambition and represent the hood youth of Compton through songs like “HUMBLE.,” Kung Fu Kenny from “To Pimp A Butterfly” is a more lyrically sensitive rapper who takes his time to capture the poetry in “Alright.” The majority of his Rolling Loud set was spent in the character of the big stepper, who has the wisdom and experience to know his limits and work on his flaws —Like in “Count Me Out,” where Lamar’s ruminations come to light in lyrics “Even my strong points couldn't survive / If I didn't learn to love myself.”
There are great musicians, and there are great performers. With this performance, Kendrick Lamar proved himself to be both. As he left the stage, his crowd of backup dancers parted for him like the Red Sea — not out of biblical reverence, but out of respect for his artistic genius.

If there is anything Playboi Carti is known for, aside from his cryptic tweets and unhinged vocals, it would be his fanbase’s unwavering ability to rage. While Carti arrived at this year’s Rolling Loud festival in Miami over 20 minutes late to his 9:15 P.M. start time — standing atop one of four white vans positioned at the back of the stage for maximum suspense — the anticipation of the crowd never faltered. Waterpouches strapped tightly around sticky backs, multicolored bandanas waving in the air, and whistles secured between puckered lips indicated the crowd was hungry to mosh. From flying water bottles to borderline demonic screeches, Rolling Loud Miami’s Ciroc Stage felt like the set of a riot the moment the first beat drop in “Stop Breathing” hit fans’ ears.
Carti’s stage design also visually leaned into the chaos. While the screen directly behind the mainstage routinely flashed between black and white as strobe lights shined down, crisscrossing to the beats, six screens bordering the stage showed grainy grayscale graphics of the popular rapper performing. These images were complemented by animations of lightning strikes, a fog machine, and intermittent pyrotechnics.
Feeding off of the crowd’s excitement, Carti brought the energy for the entirety of his set, which was unfortunately cut short due to the late start. Crowd favorite “Rockstar Made” from Carti’s second studio album “Whole Lotta Red,” which Pitchfork describes as a “pressure cooker” that “seems to careen wildly toward an unknown destination,” was second on the setlist. At this point, Carti let loose, barking to the crowd as every quadrant of the yard opened into pits.
Carti’s crowd responded rabidly, yelling the lyrics back at him while experiencing a range of emotions. In a live streamed video of the concert, overwhelmed attendees can be heard yelling “Let me out!” while others check their hands, almost surprised they are still standing.
A few songs later, Carti performed an excerpt from “Off the Grid,” an almost six-minute long track from Ye’s “Donda” album which features vocals from Playboi Carti, and for a moment it seemed possible Ye would make a guest appearance. But alas, the performance continued on — with Ye no doubt waiting in Miami Gardens for a later surprise.
Carti rounded out his set, transitioning through “Sky,” “No Sl33p,” and “Teen X,” before maxing out his time with “Control” as an impromptu closer.
After Carti’s set came to a close, a good portion of the crowd emptied out, leaving crumpled emergency water bags, ripped pieces of clothing, and even a few lone shoes in their wake. Not very keen on staying for last minute headliner Kid Cudi, some of the crowd called it a night, no doubt riding the incomparable Carti high.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Rolling Loud first released the lineup for its Miami festival dates, Gunna, Atlanta-native rapper and member of Young Thug’s YSL Records, was set to take to the stage on the second night of the festival. As was the case with most of this year’s festival, things did not go entirely to plan.
This past May, Young Thug, Gunna, and various other members of YSL were arrested and indicted by a grand-jury on RICO charges — an abbreviation for the Racketeer Influenced Corruption Act which raises an umbrella over gang-related activities ranging from gambling and bribery to murder and extortion.
The indictment characterizes YSL, also known as “Young Stoner Life,” or “Young Slime Life,” as a “criminal street gang,” with ties to the more well-known LA-based street-gang, the Bloods. 56 counts long, the indictment implicates various YSL artists in connection to the 2015 murder of “rival gang-leader” Donavan Thomas Jr. and the attempted murder of rapper YFN Lucci, who was stabbed in jail earlier this year.
Rappers getting arrested on criminal charges is not a new phenomenon: Illegal activity and street culture has been layered into the sediment (and perception) of hip-hop since the very beginning. From Biggie and Tupac’s deadly coastal war, to the codification of drugs, alcohol, misogyny, and violence, hip-hop shines a light on the realities of coming to age in unjust systems which seek to oppress Black and Brown bodies. As rap came of age in 1970s New York block parties, when attendees would spit bars over beats spun by favorite neighborhood MCs, it grew as an art form and space for reflection.

Unfortunately, attempts to use rap lyrics as evidence in criminal proceedings is not novel either — 6ix9ine, Bobby Shmurda, and Drakeo The Ruler have each had their bars cited in trial. Recently, high profile musicians such as Jay-Z, Fat Joe, Meek Mill, and Kelly Rowland have openly criticized this approach in their 2022 push for New York legislators to pass a “reform bill limiting prosecutors’ use of rap lyrics in criminal trials.” This reform bill advocates that rap be protected as a form of expression, in the same way as other, less criminalized, genres of music are.
To YSL’s demise, this reform has yet to gain widespread acceptance. According to Vulture, prosecutors on the YSL case “have cited multiple songs as evidence of gang affiliation and racketeering.”
But Young Thug and Gunna are not without their supporters — any Rolling Loud festival attendee entering Miami Gardens’ Hard Rock Stadium walked through rows of people holding green and black “FREE YSL” and “Protect Black Art” signs over their heads. Within the festival, other performers were quick to vocalize their support. From Future’s performance of “pushin P,” a collaboration with Young Thug, to Lil Baby’s “Drip Too Hard,” which co-features Gunna, the voices of YSL artists were heard throughout the massive venue as fellow artists called for their release.
Whether or not the members of YSL are acquitted of charges, the traction behind the “FREE YSL” movement is sure to encourage a culture of questioning: How do we decriminalize an industry which is often perceived as being rooted in criminality? Does celebrity status absolve agents of wrongdoing? And why do we anticipate veracity in art only when the words come from Black mouths?
