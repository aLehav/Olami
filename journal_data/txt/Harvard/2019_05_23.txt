After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As I was sitting on the ground outside of the Palais (in a skirt), waiting for the pre-screening of Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood,” I took in the sheer homogeneity of journalists: Almost everyone was white and/or male (and smoking a cigarette). And almost as soon as I had noticed, an elderly French journalist asked where I “came from.” I responded, “The United States,” to which she clarified, “No, before that.” (Before... I was born?) I’ll give her brownie points for her original choice of words, I suppose, but more than personally attacked I just felt disillusioned: These are the people who are reviewing films made by Asian directors at Cannes. I’m not sure why people were particularly interested in my ethnicity today, but this exchange happened two more times — a record I could definitely do without.
Two hours later, Lucy and I were told that we’re not good enough to get into the screening — okay, not really, but that’s essentially the experience of someone with a yellow press badge — so we moved inside to wait for a later screening. Another two hours later, and surprise! We don’t get into this one either. The people love Tarantino, but Tarantino, why don’t you love us back?
By then it was already 6 p.m., and neither of us had seen a film because we devoted all day trying to get into this one. Later that night Lucy saw Ira Sachs’ “Frankie,” while I watched Bong Joon Ho’s “Parasite,” which I had been waiting all week to see. It lived up to my expectations in the weirdest of ways, and I returned back to our Airbnb past midnight to start writing my review.
Two things have somewhat made up for today’s bumps: the pups and the celebrities (and the films, of course, but that’s a given). The dogs here are so small, so cute, and so French — as Kyle Buchanan from the New York Times tweeted, “These dogs don’t woof... they woeuf.” I’m also happy to report a spike in celebrity sightings: I saw Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe after the premiere of “The Lighthouse” on Sunday, and it’s really a shame that it isn’t up for any awards because Rob definitely would’ve had a chance at Best Actor. The next day I ran into the infamous Gaspar Noé, who surprisingly decided to show up to the press screening of his “Lux Aeterna” but unsurprisingly was nonchalantly smoking a cigarette while being attacked by journalists. (A particularly shameless American yelled, "Hey Gaspar! Thanks for making the best film at Cannes, man.” Why do Americans have to fulfill the stereotype of being loud and tactless?) And today when Tilda Swinton walked past me, I took in all of her ice queen beauty.
Now that we’re over halfway through the festival, I’m feeling a mix of sadness and relief. I don’t want to leave, but I also desperately need to be brought out of my cycle of sleep deprivation. There’s no moment like the present, though, so I’ll definitely be cherishing my last few days in the south of France. Here’s to seeing more dogs, finally seeing “Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood,” and asserting that I am, indeed, from the United States.

Céline Sciamma’s “Portrait de la jeune fille en feu” (“Portrait of a Lady on Fire”) is consciously subversive — its very title suggests that either the portrait or the lady will be set aflame, both of which happen in the film. The film, which is in competition at Cannes, engages with questions of gender and representation during the 18th century, a time almost exclusively documented by men, and centers on Marianne (Noémie Merlant), a painter who stands in for generations of forgotten female artists. While Sciamma beautifully subverts traditional conceptions of portraiture and love, she is also keenly aware of the restrictions placed on 18th century women, and therefore the limitations of her own film. Her careful navigation of this tension — of wanting to completely liberate her characters but knowing that history has dictated otherwise — makes “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” captivating and heartbreaking to watch and experience.
In 18th century Brittany, Italian noblewoman (Valeria Golino) commissions Marianne to paint her daughter Héloïse’s (Adèle Haenel) marriage portrait for a Milanese man who may take her to be his wife. But it’s no simple task: Héloïse refuses to pose, so Marianne must paint her without her knowing. She accompanies Héloïse on her walks to the sea, during which she makes furtive and quick glances at her face, committing them to memory before she can capture them in charcoal sketches in her room. Though she’s able to depict her face — a task at which the commissioned artist before her failed — her first painting follows a sort of artistic formula for a "good” portrait and lacks a connection to the subject, which Héloïse quickly detects. “Is this how you see me?” she asks, staring at the calm, smiling face looking back at her. “There are rules, conventions, ideas,” Marianne justifies, referring to the customs of portraiture. “You mean there’s no life? No presence?” Héloïse agrees to pose so that Marianne has a second chance at capturing her spirit, not just her complexion — and so that she can stay one more week at their home.
It’s during these painting sessions that the two begin to fall in love, but their relationship is not the typical artist-subject dynamic. For one, the painter is female — and her gaze is reciprocated. Not only does the painter scrutinize her subject; her subject also stares back with the same amount of attention. “When you look at me, what do I see?” Héloïse says to Marianne. For Sciamma, the female gaze sees past superficial surfaces and is more attuned to emotion — Marianne channels this gaze in her second portrait, which is a testament to her deeper understanding of Héloïse, who is angry but resigned to the fate of arranged marriage that awaits her.
Sciamma’s succinct, poetic screenplay bring the two’s budding romance to life. Both Héloïse and Marianne resent the gender roles that restrict them and only enjoy fleeting moments of agency. Héloïse expresses that she loved being at the convent because of the music and because “equality is a pleasant feeling.” Marianne suggests that women are forbidden from painting nudes of men because “it’s mostly to keep us from making great art.” But they are also keenly aware of what’s up against them — “I would love to destroy the portrait, but it wouldn’t stop the inevitable,” Marianne realizes — which imbues their inevitably short-lived love story with a heartbreaking sense of doom.
Héloïse and Marianne then savor the little time they have before Héloïse’s mother returns to bring her to Milan. The two actively defy the power hierarchies that exist within the home, like that which divides them from the young housemaid, Sophie (Luàna Bajrami). Héloïse and Sophie swap roles, as Héloïse cuts potatoes to prepare their dinner while Sophie leisurely embroiders. The three sleep in the same bed, and Héloïse and Marianne even accompany Sophie to get an abortion after she finds out she is three months pregnant. The precedent of friendship and equality that Héloïse and Marianne establish and try to carry out, however, makes what follows uncomfortable to witness and out of character for Héloïse: Without asking Sophie, Héloïse poses her on a mattress to reenact the abortion and asks Marianne to paint her. The painting alone is a powerful statement that abortions have been taking place for centuries but have been excluded from history — but Héloïse, who more than anyone should understand the objectification inherent in having to pose and be painted, commands Sophie to reenact her trauma so that she can show her boldness to Marianne. And she succeeds, as Héloïse and Marianne exchange a knowing smile as she starts painting.
This misstep is minor in the grand scheme of the portrait Sciamma paints in “Portrait of a Lady on Fire.” She treads the fine line between subversion and historical accuracy marvelously and with a keen eye for detail, and has produced her best work yet that will surely be among this year’s prize winners.

What do you do when death is knocking at the door? Director Ira Sachs answers this cliché question through the eyes of Frankie (Isabelle Huppert), a 60-something famous actress with a terminal cancer diagnosis. Premiering in competition at Cannes, “Frankie” takes viewers through a day in Sintra, a beautiful coastal town in Portugal, where Frankie gathers her family “to have a good time, which for us just means time together.” Though sometimes distracted from the heart of the matter film, Sachs manages to achieve a subtly stirring narrative.
As with many other family portrayals, dysfunction is at the center of Sach’s story. It takes Sachs a bit long to untangle just how everyone at the family reunion is related, but the web looks something like this: There’s Jimmy (Brendan Gleeson), Frankie’s current husband; Sylvia (Vinette Robinson), Jimmy’s daughter from a previous relationship; Ian (Ariyon Bakare), Sylvia’s husband; Maya (Sennia Nanua), Sylvia and Jimmy’s daughter; Michel (Pascal Greggory), Frankie’s first husband; and Paul (Jérémie Renier), Frankie and Michel’s son. Ilene (Marisa Tomei), Frankie’s good friend and hairdress, just “happens” to be in town as well. Frankie had actually invited Ilene in the hopes of setting her up with Paul, but unbeknownst to Frankie, Ilene also brought along boyfriend Gary (Greg Kinnear). At the center of the web is, of course, Frankie, pulling them all together at this unlikely reunion.
Isabelle Huppert gives a commendable performance as Frankie. Although sometimes she seems a bit aloof, her seeming passivity is part of Frankie’s own defensive nature in dealing with her disease. She’s brutally honest with other people and with herself about her future, and when she tells Gary that Ilene takes “no bullshitters,” she seems just as much to be talking about herself. Aside from Frankie, Sachs jumps in and out of the lives of other characters. The most troubled characters, Sylvia and Paul, also have the most potential for more complex development, but with the sheer number of characters cast, the short fragments Sachs gives each of them are all he can afford timewise. Frankie may be the titular character of the film, but not to be overshadowed is Marisa Tomei as the lovable Ilene. She’s at once self-assured and agreeable, a warm presence amongst so many anxious family members. Although she’s just as sad as they are about Frankie’s limited time remaining, she’s the most level-headed about the situation, perhaps because she isn’t part of the dysfunctional web in which the rest of the family is entangled. The film’s achilles heel is its portrayal of Sylvia’s teenage daughter Maya. In a subplot unrelated to Frankie, Maya escapes the town to a beach, where she has a brief romantic encounter with a teenage boy she meets on the bus. The teenagers’ interaction is as insipid and awkward as their lines, and the entire scene only vaguely relates to the other stories around Maya.
“Frankie” doesn’t provide enlightening insight into the challenge of dealing with impending death, and Frankie doesn’t come to an abrupt realization that will help her tie up all the loose ends of her life neatly in a bow. But this state of irresolution, this inconclusive ending, makes the film endearing — Sachs focuses on the everyday moments and mundane details of an idyllic but bittersweet last family vacation, making the film more realistic despite the somewhat comically ridiculous backgrounds of some of the characters. In an especially tender scene, Jimmy sits next to Frankie on the piano, who’s playing a melancholy melody (Dickon Hinchcliffe compiled a beautiful soundtrack for the film). “It’s very sad, very sad indeed,” she says to Jimmy as she glides through the piece, capturing both the mood of the music and that moment as well as her looming fate. Although Sachs gets a bit lost with so many characters to juggle, there are enough of these heartwarming moments to give “Frankie” grounding.

There’s a time and place for romanticizing philosophy, but director Terrence Malick’s most recent film is not it. In “A Hidden Life,” which premiered in competition at Cannes, Malick indeed portrays the hidden life of an Austrian man as he refuses to fight in World War II on his religious and moral grounds. Although the story has potential to provide a novel and compelling perspective, the film, which is based loosely on the true life of Catholic martyr Franz Jägerstätter (August Diehl), is flawed in its siloed presentation of Franz’s life and the disregard it shows for the many other horrors of World War II.
Franz’s main qualms with the war derive from his faith, but it seems as though his stout devotion only manifests the war goes on. As a farmer living in a beautiful Austrian village, Franz’s increasingly persistent religious reasoning to defend his beliefs would be more convincing if Malick had fleshed out Franz’s backstory and demonstrated his piety before the war started. Instead, Malick depicts Franz as a simple, seemingly carefree individual before the war, laughing on his farm planting potatoes with his wife Fani (Valerie Pachner), and drinking beers with his friends in his village, Radegund. Where was his dedication to God then?
Malick, known for his grand philosophical motifs, ultimately asks a similar fundamental issue as “grace and nature” in his 2011 film “The Tree of Life.” He presents a life of graces as accepting struggles and insults from others and the world, while “nature” is about pleasing itself and others. Applied to “A Hidden Life,” this juxtaposition reinstates itself with a more explicitly religious undertone: Grace means following God and being ostracized, punished, and even persecuted for doing so, while Nature means making decisions based on what others in society do and expect. For the Jägerstätter family, Franz’s decision to follow grace and defy the war ostracizes them from their village, and even from the Catholic Church, even though Franz is actually acting upon his faith. When Franz seeks the advice of the Bishop Joseph Fliessen (Michael Nyqvist), he finds that the execution of others who resist Hitler’s regime has silenced the Bishop himself. Disappointed but unflinching, Franz continues to resist the war, and when called to fight, his refusal to “Heil Hitler” earns him more and more punitive sentences, until he finds himself facing the Military Tribunal in Berlin.
Diehl gives an admirable if naive performance as Franz, his face reflecting genuine internal struggle as he tirelessly ponders his actions, or rather inaction, throughout the war. Even as the protagnist, Diehl has few lines, leaving viewers to ponder — or perhaps, as Malick hopes, philosophize — over the course of the prolonged film what Franz is thinking as he endures pain and sticks to his beliefs. It’s unclear what Fani really wants from her husband, too, but she’s clearly miserable. Her sister tells her to “resist him” and talk to him, but that conversation never really happens. And the few words that are uttered often tend to be grand general statements, such as “You can’t change the world, the world’s stronger,” or “Better to suffer injustice than to do it” (Fani’s father’s advice to her), or painfully innocent pleas to God like “We love Him. That’s enough.” The lack of dialogue creates a surreal aura, but it also prevents real connections among the characters such that the film seems far too removed from reality. Franz may be a martyr, but he loses grounding on Earth and Malick fails to evoke the exact pathos that Franz’s sacrifices are supposed to fulfill.
For a nearly three hour film, “A Hidden Life” does little to contextualize what else is happening during the war. The battlefield horrors only make an appearance an occasional bomb alarm sounding in Franz’s Berlin prison, or some mood-setting cloudy skies in the background. Fani sees someone, perhaps a Jewish person or an army deserter, on the run in the woods, but Malick never explicates the scene. Though Malick includes timestamps and dates in his scenes, there’s no additional information on what goes on during the war cut or, at least, Austria’s standing in relation to other international powers, which would’ve been relevant in framing the film in the right context. A black-and-white reel from the era prefaces the the film and similar footage appears a few more times, but none captures the especially brutal and thought-provoking parts of the war. By isolating Franz’s story, Malick focuses on a lesser-known perspective on the war, but his singular focus does an injustice to the many other events and important figures that he leaves out.
The film’s redeeming quality is its presentation: Breathtaking wide-angle shots of sprawling fields in Austrian mountains and a beautiful score almost compensate for the otherwise disappointing content. Even as the voiceover narrations drag on repetitively into seemingly hopeless prayers (“Ask, and you shall receive”), the music still invokes some of the emotion that the dialogues fail to. Malick employs other tactful cinematographic effects as well; moments of emotional distress are fittingly shot with jarring, angular movements.
Despite all the shortcomings of the film, Malick deserves to be commended for his efforts to shed light on a lesser-known hero who merits remembrance. By showing how the institution of the Catholic church was corruptible at the time, Malick also passes criticism on religious institutions as being just as susceptible to deviating from grace and giving into societal pressures, falling to the “nature” side. The film would have been better if Malick had given Franz’s story more grounding in the context of World War II, and left the audience to have their own interpretations of the moral considerations that gave Franz the power to face his difficulties and stick to his faith. But instead, Malick subjects his viewers to a flat and isolated account in “A Hidden Life.”

The “World’s Only Curious George Store,” a Harvard Square centerpiece, will close its doors on June 30 and relocate to Central Square following a change in ownership.
Astra S. Titus, the store’s new owner, said that the shop’s move was motivated by a variety of factors, including her desire to develop a community around the store.
“I plan on developing it more into a mission-based retail, and the mission behind it is really around community building,” Titus said. “Central Square is at this super critical exciting point where...there’s lots of things happening there that are going to be very community-focused.”
She also cited an expected decline in foot traffic due to construction projects in the Square. Titus said that Regency Developers, which owns the building that currently houses the Curious George Store, originally planned to move the shop to an alternate location on Brattle Street while the building underwent renovations.
“I envisioned that there’s going to be a decrease in foot traffic because the store in its temporary space would be much less visible,” Titus said. “This would mean a decline in revenue.”
Ultimately, Titus said that moving to Central Square would offer a “fresh start.”
Harvard Square Business Association Executive Director Denise A. Jillson said the store — which sells popular children’s toys, arts-and-crafts, and children’s books — has recently faced issues with competition from online markets.
“There’s been more and more issues around online sales,” said Jillson.
Adam S. Hirsch, the store’s former owner, said Central Square offers lower rents in a difficult retail environment.
“There’s no secret that brick-and-mortar retail is challenging,” he said. “Rents are a little lower in Central Square than in Harvard Square.”
Kennedy School Associate Dean and Chief Financial Officer Jeita L. Deng, who is also a freshman proctor, said she is “super sad” to see the store leave its longtime home, but she looks forward to visiting the new location.
She said her family, including her three-year-old son, are “ferocious readers” and frequent the store for its books.
“For us, it's more the adventure of the special treat of going and picking up and buying a new book to celebrate a new occasion or a new holiday,” Deng said. “I think we'll just have to make it a bigger adventure to go get a new book.”

Gone are the days of guaranteed dhall meals and comfy housing. Harvard has taken care of you well for four years, but it’s time to enter the world of adulthood. How does one cook a balanced meal? What do you mean you have to find your own apartment? What’s that patting thing your parents always do to the watermelons in the grocery store? It’s a scary world out there, but there are others who have done it before you and there are others who will follow you. Adulting has a steep learning curve based on experience and time, but there’s no harm in following some basic tips to help get you started on that #solo life.
Budget Wisely
When you finally get that bread, it can be tempting to eat it all at once. Splurging may satisfy your #bougie goals, but in the long run, this will leave you overwhelmed and struggling to make ends meet. Budgeting can help you responsibly meet your financial needs, and securing funds before splurging can actually allow you to treat yourself — without the guilt or regret afterward. If you need some direction, take advantage of the wide variety of online and mobile budgeting apps out there to guide your spending and saving.
Cook Your Own Meals
No, microwaving Hot Pockets or whipping up instant ramen does not count as cooking. As an independent adult, you are the only one responsible for your diet and health, so cooking your own meals can save your body and your wallet. After investing in kitchenware, start with easier recipes until you feel comfortable enough to tackle more elaborate dishes. Cooking your own meals can feel rewarding, and it’s an opportunity to flex your MasterChef skills on friends and family. You will thank yourself later.
Build Your Credit
Financial independence means that most of your purchases or opportunities in life will be determined by your credit score, which is used by many institutions to determine how financially sound you are. If you haven’t already, consider applying for a credit card — having zero credit is bad! Starting with small purchases and making payments on time is a great way to boost your credit, especially when you’re first starting out. Lots of credit cards offer deals and benefits such as cashback and reward systems, which can help you out in the future.
Make Time for Your Loved Ones
If you thought trekking to the Quad to see your friends was bad, then good luck meeting up with them in another city. Until now, we’ve been spoiled with the luxury of spontaneous dhall meals and the close proximity with blockmates and linkmates. Adulthood will involve a more conscious effort to make time for your friends and family, which can entail coordinating work schedules and traveling out of your regular boundaries. On a positive note, this means that every interaction is entirely your choice and will be that much more genuine and meaningful.
“Adulting” can mean many things. It ranges anywhere from managing your own finances to learning how to deal with loneliness and newfound independence. The world outside of the Harvard bubble can be terrifying, but it is also riddled with new opportunities and exciting experiences for you to discover. Don’t worry about feeling unprepared — if you can handle four years of Harvard undergrad, you can definitely handle living on your own.

When you first walked through the doors of your freshman entryway, it was probably hard to imagine that in just four short years you would be graduating and moving onto your career in finance. With finals done — possibly forever — and your commitments temporarily put on hold, take this time to appreciate your final days as an undergraduate surrounded by your closest friends.
It may not feel real yet, but soon you and your friends will be off on separate journeys in different parts of the world. So make sure to hold onto the friendships you’ve made over these four years and keep in contact with these cherished people — even when your lives become more hectic.
Respond to the Texts
We’ve all been there: We thought we responded to a text, but we never actually did. This may have once been easy to remedy — you’d bump into your friend while eating in the dhall or walking through the Yard, but with your friends now scattered across the globe, the easiest form of communication is frequent texting. This may even include having to download a new messaging app to keep in contact with friends who are in different countries! Learn to be prompt with the messages and remember that a quick text can remind your friends that you’ll always be there for them, even if you can’t go out for late-night Jefe’s anymore.
Snail Mail 
Sometimes the best form of communication comes from an unexpected, handwritten note. This can be especially touching if you’re writing to a friend who is halfway around the world (taking a gap year before they’re off to medical school or going back home after being an international student at Harvard).
Plan Meetups 
It’s nice to look forward to reunions with your blockmates and all the other friends with whom you’ve spent countless nights in Lamont. Make sure to always let your friends know when you’ll be in their area or plan when you’ll all have the chance to do a group FaceTime. Face-to-face catch-ups are the best ways to reminisce about the past and update your friends on your new adventures.
Watch Shows Together
You may be hundreds or thousands of miles apart, but that doesn’t mean you can’t still watch your favorite shows together! Live text each other while watching the newest episode of “The Bachelor” and immediately be transported back to the good old days in your dorm room.
Even if your life after college is even busier than before, the friendships you’ve made are too invaluable to lose. Make sure to keep in touch with each other using concrete plans and hangouts supplemented with frequent (group) texts, calls, and FaceTimes. Maybe even make a shared Google Calendar outlining monthly catch-ups!
It may be difficult, but understand that everyone is busy and caught up with their new routines. Make plans, stick with them, and be honest about your schedule!
