After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
JUNE 15, 2010
BEIJING, China–For the past few weeks, news of labor unrest has been making waves in the Chinese business world. Worker action in the country, including suicides and strikes, has spurred concerns about China’s vital role in the global supply chain as a low-cost manufacturer. Yet companies, governments and consumers of the world should welcome, instead of worry about, changes in the Chinese labor structure. Strengthening Chinese workers will bring about necessary adjustments to both the Chinese and global economies, while reducing inequality and social tensions across China.
The unrest started at the Foxconn factories in Southern China, The large technology manufacturer that produces everything from Intel Motherboards to iPods faced a spate of worker suicides this spring, motivated by stressful working conditions. The chairman of the company was forced to make a public statement at the factory, admit mistakes, and raise wages. Protests spread to Honda factories across the country, where workers have successfully demanded increased wages. Though the latest Honda factory strike’s demand for an independent trade union failed, the attempt was still a promising sign for the Chinese economy.
Chinese workers are justified in expressing their frustration with their current treatment.  Many experience pressure to work long hours and “feel they have to work long hours of overtime to secure a decent wage.” As the country grows at an incredible pace, inequality has also risen; the gap between rural and urban wages in the country is as large as has it been since 1978—the year the country began liberalization.
Many have not shared in China’s newfound prosperity.  If workers are not empowered through fair wages and representation,  discontent with the government and social instability may ensure—posing a major threat to economic growth. If the Chinese government hopes to maintain its position as a reliable manufacturer in the global supply chain, temporarily raising wages is only a stopgap solution.   China must eventually empower its workers through independent trade unions, which will allow wages and working conditions to be set in fair bargaining processes.
Companies in China and across the world are nervous about these developments. If wages rise in China, the logic goes, won’t that be factored into retail prices across the globe? Experts say no. The Financial Times recently reported that “labor costs are only about 5% of the retail price of China’s main exports – electronics and consumer goods.” Thus increases in wages will barely impact global consumers or disrupt supply chains.
Rather, the increase in wages will implement necessary adjustments in both the Chinese and global economy. Augmented wages will lead to more personal domestic consumption in China in the long term, stabilizing the country’s economic growth—currently centered on manufacturing and government spending— by rendering it less dependent on unsustainable government stimulus and sharp fluctuations in the global economy. Furthermore, the world as a whole needs to rebalance from the pre-crisis era in which America spent while Asia saved, and this requires more saving in America and increased consumption in Asia.
The New York Times recently published a profile of Tan Guocheng, a 23-year-old worker in a Honda plant who started one of the first and most successful major strikes last month. He was no glory-seeking political activist, but rather someone whose overworked and underpaid life in the factory had not met his modest expectations of joining the middle class. If corporations and the Chinese government allow workers like Mr. Tan to rise to the middle class, the Chinese and global economy will rise along with them to a healthier and more prosperous future.

PARIS, France—What’s so special about Paris? “Mais c’est Paris,” many would say, as if it’s self-explanatory. This is one of the reasons I came to Paris feeling rather skeptical–so many people adored it so much, and I didn’t see why. I visited Paris when I was twelve and my impression was that it was predominantly grey–both buildings and sky—and not too much fun.
This time around I love Paris. I have rediscovered it for myself. As a city, Paris is giving but not demanding. I also think Paris is special because it is balanced in a remarkable way; it has found a kind of golden median between quality of life and efficiency, a dynamic city life and a certain calmness, a sense of tradition and modernity.
There is a feeling of history, but not so much history that there are whole centuries to keep track of, like in Rome. The other danger of a historical city is being great for what it was, rather than for what it is, but this is not the case here. Paris is very much alive and there is a lot to do, but not to the point that it is overwhelming. It is not as calm and monotonous as Geneva—but still, Parisians are organized and efficient. Mailing a package at the post office takes no time at all. The subways arrive in less than two minutes, and stations include vending machines for food and condoms. Parisians also follow laws and keep the city clean. The next time you hear about Paris being dirty and smelly, please don’t believe it; your interlocutor must be referring to the days of Les Misérable. Despite all the Parisian protests and revolutions, there is a sense of general stability in the air.
Although the city functions well, the Parisians don’t seem very busy or intense, much less so than other big city dwellers like New Yorkers or Muscovites. The cafes are always full of people who chat while they inspect passer-bys with urgent interest (“Do you think she’s 40? Do you really think she’s 40? She looks like François’ first wife but with better legs...”). Looking good matters here, and I appreciate the easy elegance of Parisians – they are fashionably dressed, but do not have a lot of attitude about being fashionable. (Here, we will not mention the Italians).
Visiting French acquaintances, I saw that most Parisians live in tiny apartments in which everything is smaller: the plates, the chairs, the rooms, the balconies. My study abroad program placed me in a room that measured 2 meters by 2 and a half meters, about the size of an Adams House walk-in closet, smaller in length than the average basketball player is tall, and probably the smallest room you’ve ever walked into. I came up with the theory that they were forced to develop this vibrant outside culture as a solution to get out into open space more; and once they started hanging out where everyone could see them, perhaps they also decided to dress up and look good. Most apartments are small and close together (and Paris can’t get any bigger than it is), but the silver lining is that Parisians are outside, being social, and enjoying their cafes and parks, and perhaps this is one of the ways a rich culture was born.
There are free music, dance, theater and cinema events in the parks all summer long. Last weekend I heard the Russian National Orchestra play under the Eifel tower. The kiosks are filled with cultural magazines, and art museums are numerous. According to the French, if you spent five seconds looking at every object in the Louvre it would take you 500 years. And this is just one of about 170 museums. The cinemas here are as common as Starbucks’ back home, especially on Boulevard Montparnasse and St. Germaine, and play movies from all over the world. And by the way, there are Starbucks’ too.
Gastronomically, little specialized grocery stores are sprinkled everywhere in the city, and the food they sell is fresh and absolutely delicious. The quality of food is so important here, that under every McDonald’s advertisement there is another sign that says “careful, snacking is bad for you, and make sure to eat lots of fruit and vegetables” and lists a website with more information. Nevertheless, one of the most visited McDonald’s outside the States is actually in France.
Both the positive and the negative things I heard about Paris turned out to not quite be true. I heard that it is the most beautiful city in the world -- la plus belle ville du monde as the French like to call it. But I don’t think so. I don’t see how it can compare to the bright, stunning beauty of Rome, Venice or Florence. Those cities are so radiant and immediately impressive that Paris and its even architecture pale in comparison. “The City of Light”, Ville Lumière, is also not quite accurate – there really aren’t that many lights. But Paris has its own special, magnetic charm which I have never seen anywhere else, and which I feel more drawn to by the day.
I’ve also heard, as we probably all have, that Parisians are rude and snobbish. Pas du tout. They have been nice to me all the way—when I was looking for directions, ringing the doorbell of the wrong house, or asking for food in a closed restaurant. They have guided me through the city streets, explained that their neighbor actually lives four floors down, and even fed me afterhours, although time-off in Paris is allegedly sacred and untouchable. In that cafe, the cook himself came out to talk to me. He looked around the kitchen, told me which ingredients he still had left—a piece of meat, some rice and tomatoes—and said he could throw together a quick faux-filet. It was delicious, especially with a glass of red wine and then a cappuccino. Here I came up with a new personal mental health motto: “there’s nothing a good meal, glass of wine, and cappuccino can’t solve.”
Or maybe it’s just Paris itself?

MUMBAI, India—Every time I visit India, there are three things that never cease to shock me: the diversity, the disparity, and the opportunity. There are so many different Indias – the rich, the poor—the super rich, the super poor—the Hindu, the Muslim, the Christian India. There is no archetypal “Indian”—faces, food, mother tongue and politics vary widely.
But I think it is the economic disparity that always moves me the most. In America we certainly have our haves and our have-nots, but the contrast in the standards of living don’t always make you cringe—those of us living in the cushy suburbs may hardly notice them. Around the world, any big city with Fendi, Gucci and Canali will probably have poor people nearby. The difference is that in big Indian cities you actually see the poverty and you see it virtually everywhere. China by contrast notoriously restricts its poor inhabitants from entering large cities. “Where are all the beggars?” was the first question on my lips when I visited Shanghai (a city akin to New York on steroids) in April—It was a shock to my Indian perspective.
The financial hub of the Sub-Continent, Mumbai  (everyone who grew up here still calls it Bombay) is a city of extremes. My first night here I was jetlagged and hungry for paneer pizza. Walking into the hotel restaurant at 2:30 A.M. on a Thursday night, I was shocked to find it filled with aimlessly partying yuppies. Mumbai is simultaneously a playground for these rich, educated kids and the infamous home of Dharavi, Asia’s largest slum.
These extremes aren’t neatly segregated either.  Slums and poverty sprawl throughout the city—not just an accepted fact, but also an integral part of the nation’s social fabric. Ragged children beg throughout the city, along major highways and on the streets of the towering Financial District in Nariman Point. Thousands of slum dwellers live within a short walk of the new Four Seasons hotel and Industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s soon to be finished $2 billion home (no, $2 billion is not a typo).
Like any visitor, I feel overwhelmed by all this. But when I gloomily turn to my Dad with my observations, he reminds me just how far India has come. His reply would resonate with many older Indians who grew up here in the 1960s and 1970s.
“India’s come a long way in the last 20 years—you can’t even imagine how things once were. Life has really improved and will continue to improve,” he says.
And he’s right. Since the country embraced free market reforms in 1991, it has undergone tremendous growth and change. The middle class has swelled to 300 million people, more billionaires live in India than both Japan and China. In recent years (a testimony to entrepreneurship here), the economy has grown at an unbelievable 8 percent per year. The raw number and the percentage of people living below the poverty line has decreased significantly.
The economic shift has been aided by a unique set of habits and mores engrained in the Indian psyche. From the village woman who shakes down the local vegetable vendor to save a few rupees to the Investment Banker who finances IPOs of hot Bangalore IT companies, deal making, entrepreneurship and business savvy are part of Indian culture.
Still, India’s development as a first-world nation is nowhere near complete. A few figures are very telling. Right now, only of 10 percent of Indians have credit with banks, 4 percent use credit cards, and .25 percent of people own stock. As the government becomes more and more hands off, domestic entrepreneurs and big multinational companies will  figure out a way to service and empower both the poor and rich in an effort to enrich themselves.
Opportunity here is so palpable it’s tremendous—the domestic market alone is 1.1 billion people. In a fortuitous paradox, it just might be that  the very backwardness of the country provides the perfect backdrop for India’s entrepreneurship, demographics, and free market to come together and bring prosperity to a billion people.

DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania—Car after car speeds along Bibi Titi Mohammed Road, throwing up clouds of dust that fly in my face. There is no traffic light within walking distance on this main road, and the only way to cross is to jaywalk. I stand in my loafers and work clothes, both hands clutching my backpack, waiting for a five-second gap when I can scramble across the road and continue my commute to work. Sometimes I start and then leap back, having lost confidence that I can make it all the way over in time. The Dar es Salaam residents laugh at my mad dash.  They saunter across the road in stages: stopping halfway, allowing a few cars to pass, and then moseying on the rest of the way. But the idea of standing in the middle of a highway scares me.
In fact, fear has largely defined my first week in Dar es Salaam. When I walk to work I’m afraid of getting hit by a car, I’m afraid of getting my laptop stolen, and I’m afraid of getting lost. I’m afraid of food poisoning, hard-bargaining taxi drivers, and getting malaria. The constant paranoia would be comical, except that unlike the fears that drive my day-to-day actions during the rest of the year, many of my present fears could never be perceived as trivial. If I turn in an essay late or don’t make it on time to a meeting, the worst thing that could happen is that I’ll be embarrassed. If I can’t find my way back to my hotel before dark, I could be in actual danger. It’s this constant, real anxiety about my safety that makes it difficult to work well and feel at ease.
So what is there to do? I’ll be in Dar es Salaam for two months, and I can’t very well spend the entire time shying from every man, woman, and moving object. I didn’t study Swahili and travel halfway around the world in order to sit in my hotel room and watch World Cup matches for four hours a day. The only thing to do is to take reasonable precautions and learn to live with some element of fear. Maybe this means traveling only by taxi, and with others, but I have to find a balance. Almost three million people stay in Dar es Salaam, and they manage to cross roads, go out to eat, visit friends, and take in their culture; they manage to live and not just survive. “Dar es Salaam,” does, after all, translate to “sphere of peace.”

PARIS, France—Last week, a mostly white-haired crowd of academics and expatriates piled into the American Library in Paris to hear the retired Columbia University historian Robert O. Paxton discuss the research that culminated in his 1972 groundbreaking book on the Vichy government, in which he argued that Vichy—the administrative body that governed Occupied France after the 1940 Nazi invasion—acted as it did not because of intimidating Nazi pressure but because of a willingness—and, at times, an eagerness—to collaborate.
Given the debate Paxton’s book inspired first in the early 1970s but that still continues today, it seems fair to say that his work kindled a large portion of the impetus to remember Vichy and its crimes—specifically, the utter indifference with which the French state handed over its Jewish citizens between 1940 and 1945. Paxton, however, leaning over a malfunctioning microphone, said that his work no longer carries with it the same level of controversy it did, say, 35 years ago.
“It’s old news now,” he said.
But given some portions of the French response to Israel’s recent attack on a Gaza-bound flotilla, can the lessons of Vichy and its crimes really be considered “old news?”
In order to protest the violence of the Israeli Navy, for instance, a small French cinema chain cancelled all scheduled screenings of an Israeli-made romantic comedy called “Five Hours from Paris.” Instead, the cinema planned on showing a documentary about the death of Rachel Corrie, an American killed by Israeli force in Gaza in 2003.
Obviously, it is possible to criticize Israel without being anti-Semitic, and the staff members of the cinema, like many others, seem to have been motivated by the understandable desire to voice legitimate concerns about the larger question of Gaza. But the logic they employed in banning "Five Hours From Paris" is deeply problematic. In fact, if we push it a little bit, the cinema chain's logic seems to hint at some rather harrowing things about the way these individuals view both Israelis and art-making.
After all, Anne-Marie Faucon, the co-founder of the cinema chain, told The New York Times on Saturday that there was nothing specific about “Five Hours From Paris” itself that caused the protest; rather, she said that her chain merely cancelled its screenings of the Israeli film “because it was there.”
Regardless of the criticism Israel may legitimately deserve for the attack, the banning of “Five Hours From Paris” nevertheless suggests that, in at least some French minds, the perception still exists that all Israelis, as Jews living the Zionist dream, subjugate every aspect of their existence—even their capacity for artistic expression—to maintaining the Zionist enterprise above all else. But there is also the assumption that all Israelis, even the directors of romantic comedies, must think alike, i.e., in support of their government. After all, in what other perspective could “Five Hours From Paris”—an innocuous romantic comedy about a taxi driver and a French-Israeli teacher—be considered a favorable treatment of the Israeli government’s actions toward Gaza?
Whatever the political statement Faucon and her staff intended to make through their protest, the implications of their boycott seem to consider Israelis in much the same way that Vichy regarded French Jews—as agents who are concerned first and foremost with advancing the Jewish cause in every way, even in art unrelated to questions of Jewish identity or politics. It is no secret that once the first laws discriminating against Jews in France appeared in 1940, academics and artists were among the first banned from public institutions in which it was believed that they could influence students with what were seen as their insidious “Jewish” ways. In wishing to ban a romantic comedy whose only connection to Israel is its setting, is Faucon's chain thus implying that audiences who viewed the film would be similarly influenced by an Israeli ideology? And, if that is true, is the chain then passing a value judgment on the legitimacy of what it believes (misguidedly) to characterize the Zionist cause?
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem an overstatement to say that, given its justification, the act of banning “Five Hours From Paris” relies on a logic that would probably have seemed reasonable in the intellectual context of Vichy, which, as foreign minister Paul Baudoin told a group of American journalists in 1940, considered French Jews as “an empire within an empire,” outside the French social fabric. Despite any progressive statement the cinema chain may have hoped to accomplish in banning the film, does it not also seem to have relied on a similar current of thought by maintaining that even an Israeli-made love story is a means of strengthening an equally undesirable Zionist "empire?"
In other words, the film was banned because it was an "Israeli" film, which—in the cinema staff's imagination—made it into some sort of commentary in support of the Israeli navy’s attack on the flotilla.  In a sense, as Faucon seems to have confirmed in her interview with The Times, all that her staff saw in “Five Hours From Paris” was that it was Israeli-made, which appeared to them as grounds enough to ban it. That view is about as reasonable as assuming that, say, "How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days," as an "American" movie, clearly supports the U.S. invasion of Iraq. And therein lies what is perhaps the most unsettling aspect of this entire affair, no matter how small or local an issue it may seem—the prolonged insistence to interpret art solely through the lens of the national context in which it was born. Banning a film such as "Five Hours From Paris" has the potential both to constrain the artistic expression of individuals within the confines of a collective whose government—or whose borders—they may or may not support, and also to suggest that some art, because of its origin, is still unwelcome in France, just as it was 70 years ago.
From that perspective, 37 years after Paxton’s groundbreaking book about Vichy was translated into French, “old news” hardly seems the best way to describe the thought processes that gave rise to the infamous regime and its crimes.

NEW YORK, NY—In May, in response to the Arizona law on immigration, somebody in New York City had the idea that they should get arrested.  They themselves, that is.  It would be a way to bring attention to the issue, show that New Yorkers wouldn’t stand for this (“New York Is Not Arizona!”).  They’d do it in Federal Plaza, link arms to stop traffic on Broadway, go to the pen for a few hours in solidarity, until someone, somewhere, got the message.
I was doing Press for the City Council at the time, so I got involved when the photographer, who sat in the cubicle next to mine, got a call to go take pictures.  “Some council members going to get arrested,” he’d said.  “Tuesday at twelve.”  They’d done it the week before but my photographer friend had been busy, so this time he’d promised he’d come.  I asked if I could go and the photographer said, “Sure, just stay behind me.  I’ll take care of you.”
Federal Plaza is only a few blocks from City Hall, but by the time we arrived there were crowds of people around the podium.  A few council members stood behind it, along with two of the borough presidents.  It is an interesting fact that many of these local politicians are below average height.  It was a hot day out and the elected officials were bleeding bottles of Poland Spring through their navy suits, although every once in a while the sun dipped behind the Federal Building, and then it would get chilly and windy for a moment so people’s ties flapped around.
This is 26 Federal Plaza where the black SUV’s come out of the underground garage, and the windows are all tinted, and up by the 20th floor or so there’s a row of black vents.  Far below, where we were, the west-side sidewalk was pulsing with people: union organizers, ministers scratching their collars, activists, reporters with their pads hanging from their necks on yellow cords.  A Councilwoman in the center translating her words from English to Spanish and back.  An old black man with a construction cap on screaming through a bullhorn, “Si, se, puede!”
What’s striking is how little this felt like one of those protests: a sixties one, radical.  First off, the organizers had called the police early.  There were squads of them, smiling pleasantly, coming out of cop vans carrying rows and rows of plastic handcuffs on their elbows.  It’s how, when it all started, the pigs helped the protestors into the vans with both hands, a short-sleeved detective filming to make sure no rights violations were taking place.  One cop, patting an old white man on the back, adjusted his cap for him because his hands were behind his back.
But the way it all began was different, as if there were still some revolution left in the American people: starting in a rush—the linked hands, the jogging forward.  Shouting for equal rights, and freedom, and how this was the cause.  Catching the journalists and the camera-crews unawares, the reporters backpedaling with their mics held in front of them.  We shall overcome, the protestors sang, as they crossed over the double yellow lines, as the traffic came to a halt—one arm-linker said, “Oh, let the tour bus through,” but it was too late, the street was dead.  Far down the traffic extended, nothing moving for a mile.  Drivers jumping onto their hoods to see what exactly was happening.  The blinking traffic lights reflected in the plastic buttons, “I Am An Illegal Immigrant.”  The bullhorns, the camera flashes—my friend the photographer racing behind a cop car to get a picture inside the processing van, a lieutenant saying, “You better back up!”—the sergeant reading people their rights, the rows of people in the street.
I went back the next week because they said they’d be doing it again.  Every week someone gets arrested until Obama shows us reform.  After jogging over there I thought I’d missed it.  Broadway was bumper to bumper and there was a gaggle of walkers coming from the Federal Building.  A car full of auxiliary cops was making its way away.  But the plaza was empty, more or less, and I asked a Homeland Security trooper if the protest had been earlier that morning.  He looked over his attack rifle and said, no.  Nothing.  Maybe I’d gotten the wrong time.  Maybe I did.  While he talked he kept his eyes swiveling back and forth.
I walked to the bench where the podium had been seven days before, and I sat and ate my lunch.  I’d just come from another protest, to save child-care centers, and I’d left my photographer friend on the way over.  He’d had something else to shoot.  Someone going by knocked over someone else’s Starbucks.  Next to them, parallel, the cars on Broadway went by.

NEW YORK, NY—No wonder Harvard likes Wall Street so much when Harvard is so much like Wall Street.
Like Harvard, the surface that meets the sole of your shoe is brick, not concrete. Like Harvard, it would be more comfortable if it were concrete, but, like Harvard, there’s something quaint about it all.
Like Harvard, vehicles are generally forbidden on Wall Street. But just as is the case with pedestrians meandering waywardly throughout Harvard Yard, I can’t understand why someone would even want to drive here.
Like Harvard, Wall Street aims to balance its rich past with its drive towards progress. Like Harvard, historic buildings line the streets—buildings that used to permit only the rich through their doors—some of which, to this day, still arguably allow only that class. Like Harvard, a statue rests at the center of Wall Street to commemorate its heritage. This one, at the first capitol building of the United States, is of George Washington—though, unlike Harvard, this one is actually George Washington.
Like Harvard, there are always tourists here.
Like Harvard, what occupies these buildings is state-of-the-art. Vast networks of computers permeate the lavish New York Stock Exchange. Four monitors per trader is only the face of a complex system that, like Harvard, generally runs smoothly but does experience its occasional hiccup.
Like Harvard, the most quantitatively-oriented are not necessarily at Wall Street. Instead, they are about 10 blocks away at Goldman Sachs. At Harvard, they are about 15 blocks away at MIT.
Like Harvard, there is more than one gym. Like Harvard, there is never place to sit at the nearby Starbucks. Like Harvard, the best pizza place is one that no stranger would know.
Like Harvard, when you step away from its confines, you encounter a wonderful energy. Like Harvard, there are street performers. The other day, a man playing a tenor saxophone was accompanied by one on a drum set, another on bongo drums, and another on two paint buckets.
Like Harvard, everyone is in a hurry. Like Harvard, the people walking in front of you are never walking fast enough. Like Harvard, everyone has in his hand a Blackberry or an iPhone. Like Harvard, the Droid hasn’t really caught on.
Like Harvard, population is a function of time. 7 p.m. on Wall Street is, in Harvard terms, the end of May. And as it is nearing 7 p.m., I must, like in Cambridge last May, clear out, no boxes this time.

If a spy seeks to blend in with his surroundings, then the alleged Russian agent known as Donald H. Heathfield—a reputedly unassuming man whose only slight deviation was an unidentifiable accent—succeeded during his time at Harvard Kennedy School.
In interviews with The Crimson on Tuesday, many of Heathfield's classmates said that the arrest of the 2000 Kennedy School alumnus caught them by surprise. They described Heathfield, in various turns of phrase, as a nice enough individual who did not provide any noticeable indications of his alleged activity as a spy for the Russian government.
On Sunday, Heathfield and his wife Tracey L. A. Foley were two of 10 alleged spies arrested by the FBI as part of a nationwide crackdown on a Russian intelligence operation that aimed to infiltrate U.S. policymaking circles.
Karen S. Kalish, a fellow graduate of the one-year Mid-Career Master in Public Administration program, said that her memory of Heathfield depicted a "very, very nice man, a very gentle man." Yet other classmates recalled sparse, but congenial, conversations that were typically limited to pleasantries, discussion of work and family—though not much was shared even in these areas.
Many of Heathfield's classmates at the Kennedy School said that they did not personally know him, but some recalled brief interactions. Classmate Jeff P. Katz said that he "really didn't know the guy," but had attended a few parties where Heathfield—who claimed to be a Canadian-born U.S. citizen—was present and even noticed a "funny accent" that lacked the Canadian "eh." The pair even once discussed Heathfield's two sons, Katz recalled.
Recalling a subdued, "innocuous" man who claimed to be from France, Kalish said that she did not recollect Heathfield ever expressing any strong views. But a red flag appeared when she asked him where his teenaged children were—"and that was the strange part because he said they didn't live with him," Kalish said.
Classmate Daniel Carpenter, who was also in the MPA program, said that he last saw the alleged spy at the school's 10-year reunion last month and was surprised by the news of Heathfield's arrest, like many of his fellow Kennedy School alumni.
"I'm not really sure what to make of it yet," Carpenter said of Heathfield's arrest. "[My classmates and I] will definitely believe in due process, and we want to give him his time to explain what's going on."
"As far as I knew, he was per his introduction and consistent representation to me and our classmates: Donald Heathfield from Canada," classmate Mark Robert Gordon wrote in an e-mailed statement. "I look forward to learning further details as the case unfolds through the fair disposition of this matter via the United States judicial system."
As part of a series of arrests across four states on Sunday and the culmination of a multi-year investigation by the FBI and other federal agencies, authorities arrested Heathfield and Foley at their Trowbridge Street apartment and charged them with conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government and conspiracy to commit money laundering.
Trowbridge Street resident Lila M. Hexner, 85, who has known Heathfield's wife in passing for the past three years, said that the recent arrest helped her to make better sense of details concerning her neighbors that she had accepted without much questioning.
"There are a lot of things I just accepted and made up reasons for in my head," said Hexner , who noticed that the couple never attended community meetings or potluck gatherings.
Heathfield's wife—whom Hexner knew as "Ann"—had told Hexner that she was from Canada. Hexner, who noticed that Heathfield was not around his home very much, said that she was under the impression from her brief and cordial conversations with Foley that Heathfield was a salesperson who constantly traveled.
"I guess to be a good spy is to do what they did: talk very little and don't get involved. I'd guess that's the way spies are taught," Hexner said. "This may just be the tip of the iceberg."
Kennedy School spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson confirmed Tuesday that Heathfield indeed enrolled in the MPA program from 1999 to 2000, receiving his degree in his final year. Heathfield's LinkedIn profile labels him as the chief executive officer of Future Map, a consulting firm that helps governments and business to develop systems for leadership.
Foley states on her professional website that she was a real estate agent for Redfin and claims to be a native of Montreal who was educated in Switzerland, Canada, and France. In a statement the real estate company released on Monday, the corporation wrote that Foley underwent the standard background check and interview process prior to her employment as a field agent who only showed homes rather than representing clients. According to the statement, Foley was "well-liked" by her touring customers, who described her in surveys as "friendly and helpful."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan’s time at Harvard Law School drew intense scrutiny Tuesday during questioning by Senator Jeff Sessions, the Alabama Republican, who claimed that she had treated the military in a "second-class way" as dean.
Sessions, the ranking minority member on the committee, said that according to Defense Department documents the military had been obstructed in its recruiting activities at the Law School, which he said indicated a bias against the military.
Kagan said that she had worked to uphold the University’s anti-discrimination policy, while she also tried to ensure that the military would have access to Law School students.
"We were trying to make sure that military recruiters had full and complete access to our students, but we were also trying to protect our own antidiscrimination policy and to protect the students whom it is...supposed to protect, which in this case were our gay and lesbian students," Kagan said.
The sometimes-heated exchange with Sessions proved to be the day’s most terse line of questioning, but Kagan staunchly defended the Law School’s position and contended that recruiting had actually increased during her tenure.
In a May Washington Post opinion piece, Robert Merril, a 2008 Law School graduate and a Marine Corps captain, came to Kagan’s defense, arguing that as dean, she had supported veterans and made an effort to reach out to them. Kagan—not prone to emotional outpourings—said that when reading the piece was the only time during the confirmation process that she had cried.
Kagan claimed that she had partnered with veteran’s groups to ensure military access while it was barred from using the school’s official career services facilities.
On a day that saw the Supreme Court severely limit laws restricting gun rights, Kagan also said that several important second amendment cases limiting gun restrictions were “settled law” during questioning by Diane Feinstein, a California Democrat.
According to media reports, Sessions harshly criticized Kagan’s comments during remarks to reporters after the event, questioning the veracity of her description of events at the Law School.
But Kagan also showed a lighter side in Tuesday's hearings. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham asked her, in connection with the Christmas Day terrorist attack, where Kagan had spent her Christmas. Kagan responded that “like all Jews, I was probably at a Chinese restaurant."
She also quipped to Pennsylvania Democrat Arlen Specter that if the high court installed cameras she would have to get her hair done more often, a reply that left the senator rather lost for words.
Kagan is in the midst of a weeklong confirmation process that began on Monday. If confirmed, Kagan would be the youngest Justice on the Court, and the first Justice since William H. Rehnquist without prior judicial experience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Editor's Note: Nicholas B. Snavely '10 and Tina Y. Tan '10 are no longer engaged.
Nicholas B. Snavely's '10 first impression of Tina Y. Tan '10 couldn't have been that great. After all, she was mad at him for having received the science department's award for being the student with the highest grade in the class.
That was ninth grade.
Three years later, as Tan exited her second period Theory of Knowledge class at Inglemoor High School in Seattle, Wash., she found Snavely waiting outside with white and yellow flowers in hand. His former competitor agreed to be his prom date.
They weren't sure if their young relationship was going to last. He was going to the University of Michigan, and she was leaving for Harvard, putting the high school sweethearts 800 miles apart. During their freshman year in college, they saw each other all of three times.
"I think that the first challenge was getting through the first year," Tan said. "That was something that gave us both an idea of how well our relationship was."
After a year apart, Snavely applied to transfer and was accepted to Harvard. As luck would have it, he was also placed in Lowell House, where Tan was assigned.
The two tried to be in the same classes, even though she concentrated in molecular and cellular biology and he in economics.
The pair also stuck together outside of the classroom. By the end of their sophomore year, they'd become co-presidents of the Cambridge Microfinance Initiative.
While Tan was away at the annual Lowell House garden party during senior week this May, Snavely gathered photos of the couple through the years and arranged them with an "elaborate display" of flowers.
"He is really, really sincere," Tan said of her fiancé, "and he always puts the people he loves and cares about above everything else."
"What I like most about Tina is her passion for life," Snavely said. "She's one of those rare people who can find excitement and happiness anywhere, and even small things like seeing a group of baby ducks on the side of the road can make her all ecstatic and bubbly."
Tan and Snavely will wed on Aug. 16, 2010 in Seattle, Wash. The two plan to spend a year in China before applying to medical school and law school.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge Review Committee released today its final report analyzing the controversial arrest of Professor Henry Louis "Skip" Gates, Jr., providing broad recommendations to bridge the perceived communicative gap between the police force and Cambridge community, while brushing over the race issue.
The 60-page document entitled "Missed Opportunities, Shared Responsibilities" details the July 16, 2009 encounter between Gates and arresting officer Sergeant James Crowley, and the ensuing national discussion about procedural justice. Pinning the blame for the incident on misunderstanding between both parties, the report concluded that thoughtful communication between Gates and Crowley would have better resolved the conflict.
Despite the  national attention devoted to the issue of racial bias on the part of  the Cambridge Police Department in the aftermath of Gates’ arrest, the  committee notably only briefly mentions the question of race throughout  the report.
The final page of the report, labeled "Appendix E," cites a Columbia University Business School study conducted a year before  Gates' arrest examining "whether Cambridge police officers exhibit  racial bias in their decisions to fire weapons under stress." But no clear  conclusions are drawn about racial biases and no connections are made  with the Gates' arrest incident.
Acknowledging that the arrest was “not a success in terms of police-community relations,” the report stated that both men “missed” the different opportunities to “de-escalate” the encounter. For example, Gates could have taken Crowley’s perspective of the situation and spoken respectfully to Crowley, and the officer could have better explained his reasoning for the arrest.
"The Cambridge Review Committee believes that the July 16th incident was  avoidable," the report stated. "Sergeant Crowley and Professor Gates  each missed opportunities to 'ratchet down' the situation and end it  peacefully."
The report stated that the biggest disparity between the accounts provided by Crowley and Gates—“Two well-regarded people…one white, one black; one an experienced and well-trained police sergeant, one an eminent scholar”—could be found in their respective interpretations of the July 16th event, signaling the need for more effective communication.
“[E]xploring differing perspectives is critical to effective policing,” the report stated. “If residents do not support a police action or policy, the police must learn the reason why.”
In discussing the concept of “procedural justice” in relation to law enforcement officers’ treatment of individuals, the report stated that research shows people’s feelings about a police encounter depend significantly on whether they felt the officer displayed respect and courtesy
In further emphasis on the need for heightened communication, the report stated that the July 16th incident highlighted the need for “community education about the role and the limitations of the police,” and “swift and reliable communication between city leaders and the public.”
Among its recommendations for better community and police involvement, the report called for educating police officers in effective techniques for de-escalating conflicts, and for a series of community forums convened by the Cambridge Police Department.
With the Cambridge Police Department facing increased scrutiny in light of the Gates arrest, CPD Commissioner Robert Haas called for a study to identify the “lessons to be learned” from the incident. The result was the September 2009 formation of the Cambridge Review Committee, a panel of 12 academics and law enforcement personnel selected for expertise in issues like policing, community relations, race, and conflict behavior, as well as the City of Cambridge.
The committee was charged with generating recommendations regarding police training, department procedures, and the role of race and class in policing—particularly significant given the nationwide accusations of racial bias on the part of the CPD in the arrest of Gates, who is African-American.
The committee finally publicized its report—which is dated June 15—after mounting uncertainty regarding its release date. In a March 1 “progress report,” the committee stated that a final report would be issued in the late spring, but even as late as mid-June, the CPD said that it was unaware of any release date for the report.
On Friday, the CPD announced that the final report would be released today and presented at a press conference in the afternoon.

Harvard students who often hanker for late-night meals have a new option  on their list: Chutneys, an Indian restaurant that specializes in  cheap, ready-to-go, roll-up sandwiches, opened today in The Garage.
The new restaurant—which will be open from 11 a.m. until midnight most days because "students don’t have a time frame of when they want their  food"—features a variety of vegetarian, chicken, and lamb roll ups that  represent a unique divergence from the usual variety of sandwiches sold  in  Harvard Square, according to owner Sanjay Kansagra.
The point of  differentiation, he said, is the chutney that will be included in a roll  up, along with the vegetables and spices. Originated in India, chutney  is a condiment made from fruit, vinegar, sugar, and spices, and  Kansagra's restaurant boasts seven varieties of the sauce: mint, garlic,  yogurt, spicy pineapple, sweet mango, tamarind, and green.
In addition to the roll ups, Chutneys serves other Indian dishes  such as samosas, kachodis, and chicken fried momos.
Chutneys—now  occupying the space previously held by Flat Patties, the burger joint  that moved out in January—will have to compete with a  handful of other Indian restaurants already in the Square. After the  Bombay Club left its location in the Crimson Galleria in  November 2009 due to declining sales and a financial dispute with its  landlord, three Indian restaurants remained in the Square: Tamarind Bay,  Tanjore, and Café of India.
But Kansagra said that Chutneys, in  contrast to these sit-down restaurants,  will appeal to hungry students  and Cantabridgians with its late hours, personalized yet fast-paced  service, and cheap prices (each roll-up costs between $4.50 and $5.50).  In fact, a key piece of Kansagra's business model for Chutneys was its  appeal to students.
“It’s going to be much more reasonably priced,” said Kansagra, who also  owns the Subway in The Garage. “It’s going to be made in front of you,  the way you want it. And it’s more like a roll up that you can take out  with you.”
With its midnight closing time throughout the week, Chutneys will be  tied for the third-latest takeout style restaurant in the Square on  weeknights, just behind Pinocchio’s and Falafel Corner.
In an  effort to put his new establishment on the map, Kansagra plans on  distributing free coupons in the coming weeks and in the early fall once  students have arrived back on campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The fans were sweltering on a muggy summer day inside Lavietes Pavilion when the point guard sporting a white “Harvard Basketball” penny came up with the ball in the open court.
Turning toward the basket, he dribbled down the sideline with a teammate trailing behind him and one defender between him and the basket.
Just as the defender made his move to stop the ball, the point guard let a pass go between his legs that bounced into the hands of his streaking teammate, who finished with a two handed slam.
No, that was not Harvard’s Oliver McNally with the dime or the Crimson’s Kyle Casey with the flush, as is the case most of the year at Lavietes Pavilion. Instead it was West Boca’s Tommy Sirkin connecting with St. John’s Prep’s Pat Connaughton—two of over 70 high school basketball players that participated in the annual Basketball Academy at Harvard this weekend.
Participants from as far away as California, Indiana, and Florida flew in for the three-day camp that took place in Cambridge from June 26-28. Led by the coaching staff of the Harvard men’s basketball team and four current and former varsity players—rising sophomore Jeff Georgatos, rising juniors Andrew Van Nest and Keith Wright, and Dan McGeary ’10—the participants were given a taste of basketball at the Division I level.
The campers ran the same transition defense drill as the Crimson, tested their agility at the Palmer Dixon training facility, lived in college dorms, listened to a guest lecture from former Philadelphia 76er’s General Manager Billy King, and scrimmaged on the court at Lavietes.
And while this year’s group of players may not have had the same talent as last year’s crop—which included Vanderbilt’s Rod Odom and Stanford’s Dwight Powell—there were still a handful of players who managed to catch the attention of the handful of Division I and Division III coaches that were in attendance.
Northfield Mount Hermon, which boasts one of the top basketball programs in the country and is represented well on Ivy League basketball rosters, sent three players to the Harvard camp, including Evan Cummis, a 6’8” forward ranked 14th in New England in the class of 2012 according to New England Recruiting Report.
Along with teammates Tommy Carpenter and Cazador Armani, the three NMH players led their team to a come-from-behind championship victory against the team coached by McGeary on the final day of camp. Additionally, each participated in the concluding all-star game.
Joining the trio at the all-star game was sharpshooter Drew Dyer of Colorado, who knocked down a couple of big threes in the contest and throughout the weekend. The rising senior is reportedly interested in playing at the Ivy League level.
Connaughton—ranked 29th in New England for the class of 2011—had his share of highlight-real plays during the final contest, elevating over his defender and throwing down a two-handed slam as he was fouled.
Myles Pearson, a 5’10” guard from California rated a 78 on a 100-point rating scale used by ESPN.com to evaluate high school basketball players with college basketball potential, also showed off his skills in the all-star game.
And for the Ivy League hopefuls and the nationally recognized prospects, the camp provided an opportunity for both the players and the Harvard coaching staff to get a better look at each other.
Perhaps if both sides liked what they saw, some of the campers could be trading in their “Harvard Basketball” pennies for a real Crimson uniform in the near future.

Well folks, it’s summer. And, remarkably, the world (including the Ivy League) keeps turning even when you’re kicking back on summer vacation.
For one, Connecticut Senator Chris Dodd has sided with the Peruvian government in the battle over the Incan artifacts housed in Yale’s Peabody Museum, according to the Yale Daily News. Apparently, Dodd has just recently returned from a trip to South America, where he met with various officials in the Peruvian government—including President Alan Garcia. After these meetings, he urged the university to return the artifacts to Peru. Hiram Bingham, a Yalie, had discovered the artifacts (which include art and human remains) at Machu Picchu in 1911.
In the quaint little WASPish enclave of Princeton, N.J., it seems as though there’s a little town-gown skirmish that’s just about to heat up. Princeton paid $10 million in taxes last year to the local community. But seeing as the university owns 43 percent of the Borough of Princeton’s land and 13 percent of the adjoining township’s land, the community feels that the university could give more—an additional $28 million, a figure that would result if all of its land were taxed.
Also, our neighbors down the Charles River have signed a “historic agreement” with Russia. MIT and Foundation Skolkovo—which represents the Russian Federation—have become partners in exploring education and research in Russia. One possibility for cooperation is creating "a network of joint research laboratories, where researchers will work at MIT and Russia." That's pretty cool—and a good way for Russia to learn about America without using spies.
