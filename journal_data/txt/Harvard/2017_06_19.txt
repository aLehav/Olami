After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I was thirteen, I lied to my best friend about having bulimia. I wanted drama. (This was middle school, after all.) I wanted attention. Most importantly, I wanted someone to talk to me about my relationship with food.
I do not want to delegitimize eating disorders. These mental illnesses are genuine and scary, deserving of our attention and care. Instead, I also want to give legitimacy to those facing mental health issues that do not come with a diagnosis. Their problems deserve just as much attention and care.
I didn’t have an eating disorder, but I thought about food a lot: I wrote rules for myself in a code language and pinned them above my desk. I kept a hand-written food journal before the days of calorie counting apps. I watched everything that my friends ate and compared it to my own meal.
I wanted to talk about food with my friends, but I felt like I didn’t have a legitimate claim to a conversation. I thought that I needed a diagnosable problem—either bulimia or anorexia—to be taken seriously. I thought that it wasn’t right of me to ask for attention when my friends had real problems, problems with names, while all I had was a food journal.
Now, I know that I shouldn’t have lied about having bulimia. I should have told my friend that I was struggling and looking for help navigating the world of food. Even without a diagnosis, I was showing signs of minor mental health issues. I have always been lucky to have thoughtful friends who help me work through made-up problems and the real ones underlying them. But I know hard it feels to seek help if we think our problems aren’t “real” enough.
So I gave my bad relationship with food the label of “bulimia” even though I had never purged. I felt like that label would give an appropriate level of gravity to my thoughts. I told my best friend (and eventually all my friends) that I had thrown up a few times and  got the desired result: attention and support.
My decision to fake bulimia might make it seem like I’m just an attention seeker. And, admittedly, I took drastic measures to get validation and attention. But most of us are constantly looking for attention, and I don’t think that’s inherently a bad thing. We want others to validate our thoughts and work through them with us. This is human. Asking for attention can lead to some of the most powerful and intimate conversations. “Attention seeker” shouldn’t be a derogatory term.
Instead, let’s make “attention giver” a positive term. Sometimes, when we are on the receiving end of these conversations—when our friend wants to talk about their thoughts—we can forget that they are probably just asking for attention, and that their call for attention is valid.
I’m not saying that all mental health issues develop as a call for attention. I am saying, however, that some problems can begin this way; that people who engage in self-destructive behavior as a cry for help are not inherently bad and deceptive; and that we all have a role to play as friends to take people’s thoughts seriously before they manifest as actions.
Too often, we expect our friends to come to us with evidence of a problem. We want their problem to have a big and scary name like anorexia or bulimia. We want to be able to see their problem in their untouched plate of food, or to catch them throwing up in the bathroom. We are not as quick to identify a problem when our friend is thinking a lot about food. Yet these thoughts in themselves, before they become actions that we can observe and name, are already real threats to mental health.
As students, it is not enough to recognize and talk about what our friends are doing that are indicative of mental health issues. Instead, we also need to consider what our friends are thinking. We need to respond with just as much care and attention to these thoughts as the actions they might inspire. We need to give our friends attention before they ask for it in self-destructive ways.
Harvard and its students already do a lot to tackle mental health issues on campus through counseling and dialogue, and we should be proud of that. But we need to reinforce the institutional effort on the individual level.
Maybe all we need is to talk to each other a little more, with a little more openness about our desire for attention and a little more willingness to give attention back. Let’s fill our campus with attentiveness—to those struggling with diagnosable mental health issues, and to those who just want to talk.
We can’t wait for our friends to lie about having bulimia to talk to them about food.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I was driving back home from L.A. when Kendrick Lamar’s HUMBLE. came on the radio. After rapping along for a few minutes, as anyone with unrealized dreams of being a rap star does, I changed the radio station. Kendrick Lamar was playing. Again. This time it was the radio edit of m.A.A.d city. I changed the station. And—yes, you guessed it—Kendrick again, this time backed by Rihanna on LOYALTY.
Within the span of 10 minutes, I’d listened to three different Kendrick Lamar songs on the radio. Though it felt excessive in the moment, it’s not incredibly surprising. Throughout his career, Kendrick Lamar has had 28 songs break onto the Billboard Hot 100, including all 14 tracks from his most recent album DAMN. His music has frequented radio waves, college parties, workout playlists, and everything in between. But the Compton-bred rapper’s popularity begs a simple question: What is it about his music that makes it so popular amongst a broad, and largely non-black, American public?
On the surface, it’s because it’s radio friendly. The songs are catchy and well produced. But underlying the apparent innocence of radio-friendliness is the fact that white audiences are consuming his music without grappling with the struggles of the black American experience.
For example, the version of m.A.A.d city that gets played on the radio is a butchered edit of the original. The full version is nearly six minutes long, with a beat switch halfway through. The second half opens with the line, “It ain’t nothing but a Compton thing...I’mma teach you some lessons bout the streets” and Kendrick proceeds to talk about gang violence, drug abuse, and shootings in his hometown. This portion of the song never gets played on the radio or at parties and, not surprisingly, reflects a larger trend of ignoring the black pain that inspires black art.
Kendrick Lamar’s most popular songs—HUMBLE., DNA.—are those that white audiences can consume without confronting the subject matter. Kendrick Lamar’s second album, To Pimp a Butterfly, was highly political and concerned with issues of colorism, racialized self-hatred, and growing up amongst violence and poverty. Put simply, it was an album about the black experience in the United States, inspired by jazz music, performed in chains, and black to the core. But the album wasn’t played as widely because of its heavy subject matter and complex jazz compositions. Unlike DAMN., To Pimp a Butterfly is harder to consume. It’s important listening, but it’s not easy listening.
American obsession with black art that is easy to swallow isn’t new. Although rap and hip hop gained popularity through songs that dealt with the struggles of black communities, the genre has been massively commodified by white America. Hip hop has come to influence the majority of pop music, and white rappers who perform for mostly white audiences are becoming increasingly popular.
Miley Cyrus, after releasing an album that borrowed heavily from the rap and hip hop music scene, spoke negatively of the genre, saying “that’s what pushed me out of the hip-hop scene a little. It was too much ‘Lamborghini, got my Rolex, got a girl on my cock.’” In her unapologetic appropriation, she reveals a truth about the consumption of black art. White people love black art until it forces them to see or engage black pain beyond caricatures and stereotypes. To avoid confronting black pain, white audiences turn to white artists who appropriate black art without substance.
At other times, white audiences discredit the political nature of black art completely. When contemporary artist Kara Walker made a 35-foot sugar sculpture of a black, female sphinx, she intended it to be “overwhelming.” The piece was meant to represent the “countless black women whose unpaid labor and overworked bodies bore the burden of our culture’s rapacious desire for all things sweet.” Yet, in the whitest fashion imaginable, Brooklyn go-ers took pictures of themselves performing sexually explicit acts on the sculpture.
At Harvard, it’s common for a Kendrick Lamar song to play and for the whole room to sing along, n-word and all. One night, a friend walked past a final club and heard Kendrick Lamar’s Alright, a song that’s become an anthem for the Black Lives Matter movement, playing. As if that in itself wasn’t bad enough, the members had changed the lyrics from, “We’re gonna be alright” to “We’re gonna be all white.” Instead of dealing with centuries of pain, white Americans take the convenient, consumable aspects of black art and exploit them for their own pleasure.
While these examples differ in their transgressions, they all show how easily white people push aside the histories of suffering that inform black art. We add another injustice to the list whenever we consume black art without supporting the black struggle. Police officers are still killing black Americans, you’re six times more likely to be incarcerated if you’re black, and anti-black racism pervades every aspect of American life. So don’t consume black art born of black grief without being down for the cause.
Kendrick Lamar has done his part with DAMN. He’s created a work of art with a purpose, referencing his album’s message when he said, “You need to hear it. I can’t sugar coat the reality.” It’s time white Americans give up their sweet tooth and begin to enjoy black art for what it really is.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After months of community debate and meetings, &pizza has abandoned its plans to move into the Harvard Square property previously occupied by Tory Row and Crimson Corner.
Cambridge’s Board of Zoning Appeal denied the Washington, D.C.-based pizza chain’s application to open a store at 8 Brattle St. at the body’s April 27 meeting, halting &pizza’s hopes of a branch in Harvard Square.
After debate and statements from Cambridge residents, the BZA voted to deny &pizza the necessary “fast order food” permit to move ahead with its plans, citing a superfluity of pizza restaurants already in the neighborhood.
“You’ve got to tell us and convince us why your pizza offering fulfills a need in the city or in the neighborhood when there are five fast order food establishments offering pizza in a very short walking distance of your proposed location,” BZA Chair Constantine Alexander said at the meeting.
While attorneys for &pizza contended that the chain’s oblong pies, unlimited toppings, and late hours differentiated it from its competitors, Alexander was unmoved.
“To paraphrase Gertrude Stein, a pizza is a pizza is a pizza,” Alexander said.
&pizza CEO Michael Lastoria did not respond to The Crimson’s request for comment, but told Eater Boston earlier this month that despite the roadblock, &pizza will continue to pursue a restaurant in Harvard Square.
“Harvard Square and its passionate community are great examples of celebrating oneness—one of &pizza’s core values,” he wrote. “Through this process, we have gotten to really know and love Boston and the Cambridge community and look forward to the day we can open our doors.”
According to Harvard professor Suzanne P. Blier, an active member of the newly formed Harvard Square Neighborhood Association, those doors will not be at the corner of Brattle St. and Mass Ave.—the ruling effectively ends &pizza’s hopes of opening in that storefront.
“Once the zoning board rules on this, it is basically the end of the line,” Blier said. Should &pizza still wish to open a store in the Square, they can choose to reapply at a different location or with a different service model.
Attorney Michael Ford, representing &pizza at the hearing, emphasized that the landlord of the Brattle St. building sought out the pizza company because he thought it would “liven up the Square.” At the hearing, Ford said that &pizza had already met with many community members, incorporating their suggestions into a series of revised architecture and design plans. He said he envisioned that cooperation would continue after &pizza’s proposed opening.
“We've tried to give you the absolute best that we can,” Ford said. “We could just say that &pizza will become part of the fabric of Harvard Square and we hope to make you proud.”
Community members at the hearing were largely opposed to &pizza’s petition, expressing concerns over the number of fast food places restaurants in the Square, the storefront’s monochromatic aesthetic, and the added traffic the restaurant could bring to the already congested corner. The BZA hearing was the latest in a series of community meetings where residents have expressed such concerns.
Blier said that a different location could have changed the decision of the planning board and the views of some Cambridge residents.
“There is very, very little room for tables and chairs for people to sit down and enjoy a meal with each other. And what this part of the Square actually needs is places we can encounter each other,” Blier said. “Because &pizza is so heavily take out, this didn’t seem to be the right opportunity.”
Blier said that location previously occupied by Uno Pizzeria, which closed in September 2016, would have been a better spot for &pizza.
