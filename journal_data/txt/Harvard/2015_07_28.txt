After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At some point during the 11-hour flight between Miami and Santiago, a realization finally struck me—I was travelling to the Southern Hemisphere. The half of the world I had never set foot in—a new continent in the throes of late autumn, preparing for winter. This was also to be my first time anywhere in Latin America. Finally the plane touched down, and I found myself in the surprisingly small Arturo Merino Benitez International Airport, which was adorned with banners welcoming tourists for the 2015 Copa América soccer tournament—the world’s oldest international soccer tournament—being held in Chile that year.
I’m the type of tourist who likes to find out as much as I can before traveling somewhere. Thus, when I decided to apply to the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies’ Health and Spanish Immersion program in Santiago, Chile, I endeavored to look up as much as I could about Santiago during the application process, learning about a number of different tourist attractions and historical anecdotes from such scholarly sources as TripAdvisor and Wikipedia.
During the long car ride from the airport to my host family’s apartment, my host parents pointed out many of those same landmarks, which I gazed at in amazement, exhausted after an overnight flight, but still wide-eyed. We passed the Mercado Central, Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Cerro Santa Lucía, Cerro San Cristóbal, and Costanera Center, with advertisements featuring huge images of Chilean soccer stars Claudio Bravo, Alexis Sanchez, and Arturo Vidal lining the streets. Eventually, I settled into my new bedroom, and went with my host family to Pueblito Los Dominicos—a popular tourist marketplace in the upscale Las Condes district of Santiago.
 The next day, I woke up bright and early to reach the DRCLAS office, located right next to the United Nations regional offices, to begin orientation. Harvard operates two programs in Santiago—the 12-student Health and Spanish Immersion program (which I was participating in, and which is largely geared toward pre-med students) and the 9-student Summer Internship Program (where students work for government ministries and non-profit organizations). Orientation and most program-wide events involve all students from both programs together.
Orientation week proceeded at a brisk pace as we heard presentations in the morning covering a wide range of topics related to Chilean history, culture, and language (Chilean Spanish is very distinct from other varieties of Spanish), as well as Santiago, followed by visits to many of Santiago’s principal landmarks and cultural attractions in the afternoon. By the end of the week, we had checked off many of the top “Things to Do” in Santiago according to TripAdvisor. But while giving me, someone who takes far too many photos, plenty of opportunities to use my camera, this only scratched at the surface of truly experiencing Santiago and Chile.
Chile is, of course, a geographical oddity—an impossibly long, comically narrow country stretching across the southwestern coast of South America. One could forgive it for appearing geographically conflicted. Where the country is truly conflicted, however, is socioeconomically. The question of whether or not Chile is a developed country is an interesting one. It leads Latin American countries in a number of important metrics, such as the Human Development Index, where Chile scores an 0.822 out of 1. This places it in the “Very High” category, about even with countries such as Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic. It has experienced unprecedented economic growth over the last 25 years, a phenomenon termed the “Chilean miracle.” Santiago has an emerging skyline that projects an image of wealth and security.
 A unique element of the Health and Spanish Immersion program is that it sends us all over Santiago—from the wealthiest comunas (sort of like boroughs) such as Las Condes and Vitacura, which look and feel like Back Bay, the Upper East Side, or any exclusive, affluent urban neighborhood in the United States to comunas like Pedro Aguirre Cerda and La Pintana, where Human Development Indices and living conditions very much resemble those found in developing countries.
Santiago is also an extremely socio-economically segregated city. The wealthiest and most impoverished comunas are quite far apart, practically on opposite sides of the city. The Plaza Baquedano (commonly known as the Plaza Italia, its former name), found at the intersection of the Alameda and Avenida Vicuña Mackenna (the capital’s two main streets), is Santiago’s principal socioeconomic dividing marker in the city’s urban consciousness. It divides the wealthy comuna of Providencia from the center of Santiago, thereby setting off the richest part of the city, the Sector Nororiente (the northeastern sector of the capital, which consists of the comunas of Providencia, Ñuñoa, Vitacura, Las Condes, La Reina, and Lo Barnechea, and is located closer to the Andes Mountains), from the rest of Santiago.
 It was in one of those impoverished comunas—Pedro Aguirre Cerda—where I found myself shadowing doctors in a consultorio, a large public health family health clinic. My clinic, the CESFAM Padre Pierre Dubois, served a sizable population of patients, virtually all of whom relied on Chile’s public health insurance program, Fonasa, for health coverage. Fonasa covers approximately 80% of Chile’s population, while 15% of the country’s population (generally members of the wealthy and upper-middle class without pre-existing conditions) is covered by Isapres, the private health insurance providers. This has led to two parallel systems emerging in terms of healthcare delivery: a system of public consultorios and hospitals where the vast majority of patients covered by Fonasa go and a system of private clinicas, where the majority of patients are covered by Isapres.
Given the sheer difference in size between the public and private healthcare systems of Chile, there is, of course, a disconnect between the two. While the two perform similarly in many metrics, wait times are significantly shorter in private clinics than they are in consultorios or public hospitals, and private hospitals are able to provide much more personal attention to each patient.
After shadowing doctors in the consultorios for two weeks, a group of us rotated through a rural consultorio in Melipilla province, about an hour’s drive from Santiago, where we accompanied medical students on house visits. We are now currently rotating through hospitals in Santiago, and are also taking Spanish classes with a medical focus and volunteering in different organizations (in my case, the National Institute of Rehabilitation). This has given us a broad spectrum of experience with many different facets of healthcare in Chile, as well as with the social realities of the country. All in all, it has been a wonderfully enlightening experience.

Though Santiago is home to roughly one-third of Chile’s population, there’s a lot more to the country than just its capital. Thankfully, the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies program—which has brought me to Chile—has also allowed us to experience the cultural and natural beauty of other parts of the country, in addition to those offered by Santiago. Perhaps most notable was our visit to Valparaíso, Chile’s third-largest city, located about 90 minutes west of Santiago by road.
 Valparaíso prospered as a port during its heyday (the 18th and 19th centuries), serving as a major stopover for ships travelling between the Atlantic and Pacific around Cape Horn or through the Strait of Magellan. It remained the country’s principal economic center until the early 20th century (hard to believe now, as Santiago is home to roughly one-third of Chile’s population today). After the Panama Canal opened in 1914, Valparaíso’s economy began to falter, and the city entered into a lengthy period of decline. It began a revival in the early 1990s as a haven for artists and hipsters, and its Historic Quarter was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2003. It has even recovered some of its port activity, hosting post-Panamax ships that are too big for the Panama Canal. Today, it is also a favorite of international tourists, drawn to the city’s history, culture, and the street art that permeates the colorful houses that dot its many cerros (hills).
 Perhaps the only comparison I can make between Valparaíso and a U.S. city would be to call it a cross between San Francisco and Detroit (though smaller than both). Geographically, Valparaíso and San Francisco are twins—both are located on 42 hills overlooking a large bay. There are other similarities as well: both were devastated by earthquakes in 1906. However, like Detroit, Valparaíso went through a long period of decline after its main industry faltered, and also like Detroit, Valparaíso has begun a revival and has made art, particularly street art, an important part of that revival.
 After Valparaíso, many of us also visited the nearby beach resort town of Viña del Mar. A group of us also managed to visit all three of Chilean Nobel Prize-winning poet Pablo Neruda’s houses—a personal goal of mine, since I wrote a 12-page paper about Neruda’s Canto General in high school. Most of us also visited the town of San Pedro de Atacama, located in the extreme northeast of Chile in the Atacama Desert, the world’s driest desert. Between huge salt flats, flamingos, geysers, alpine lakes, sandboarding, and archaeological sites and museums, this was no ordinary desert, but one of the most beautiful places in the world. An avid football (soccer) fan, I also had the good fortune of going to two Copa América matches courtesy of my host family’s ability to find affordable tickets—a group stage match (which I went to with a friend from the DRCLAS program) between Brazil and Venezuela and the semifinal (which I went to with my host family) between Chile and Peru. Chile wound up winning the tournament for the first time ever (in its 99-year history), doing so at home. The streets of Santiago were a giant party afterwards, abuzz with the celebratory honking of car horns.
 Despite all of its smog (which was quite bad this winter due to a lack of rain), its astounding socioeconomic disparities, lack of spicy food, and petty theft (violent crime is quite rare, but my phone was stolen as I was using it to take a picture of a celebratory crowd at the Plaza Baquedano after a Chile football victory), Santiago has been a kind host to me, and neither it nor the country have ceased to amaze me. Santiago is at once old and new; it is nearly as old as neighboring capitals Lima and Buenos Aires, but at once looks younger—its architecture a haphazard hodgepodge of old and new (not unlike a large American city like New York or Boston). It has given me a huge range of places to explore, and has given me lots of things to think about over the last five weeks. My host family has also been amazing - they have been the best host family I ever could have asked for. I can’t wait to see how the last few days of my program finish up.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last summer, I worked as an intern in Washington, D.C. for a large federal agency. I lived in a George Washington University dorm, and many of my high school friends shared a house in Georgetown. We had an amazing summer—learning at our jobs, exploring the city, and planning our future careers in public service. This summer, I’m working at the Massachusetts State House, again having a great internship. I’m seeing the inner workings of another branch of government, making more connections, and gaining valuable experience for my career.
This story seems simple enough, but in reality, the opportunity to have such experiences is a far reach for most students. Why? Because neither the state nor federal government pay their interns. I’m fortunate enough to go to Harvard, where the Institute Of Politics has funding that can help cover some or most of the cost of a summer internship. And even then, I was lucky to receive that funding; despite our huge endowment, Harvard is unable to provide stipends for most of its students interested in working in public service. Further, my parents live in Boston and let me live rent-free for the summer. They both have steady jobs, so I don’t have to contribute to household expenses.
These factors have made it possible for me to get a leg up on my career in public service. This is true not only for me, but for many other students with similar backgrounds—middle or upper-middle class and living near internship centers like Boston, New York, and D.C. Given the fact that internships are the most important factor in deciding whether to hire a recent college graduate, this also produces a profound effect on the makeup of those who work full-time for the government. In short, unpaid internships undermine the American ideal of a representative democracy.
In many ways, the ideal of a “representative democracy” has failed to live up to its name; consider, for example, the statistic that the sons of senators are 8,500 times more likely to become senators themselves. But beyond the influence of money, connections, and privilege on our elected officials, consider too how these factors influence their staffs: Unpaid internships exist as a huge privilege for the well-to-do in getting jobs in government.
And staff matters. Staffers draft the bills and advise the legislators how to vote on them, implement government programs, and provide constituent services. They help elected officials plan their agendas, write the speeches, and direct funding. They are the cogs that keep the government machine running.
Having a staff of former interns means that our government is run by people who are better prepared for the job, who arrive armed from the first day with experience and understanding. But as long as those internships remain unpaid, it also means that our government employs a disproportionate number of people who grew up relatively well-off. This is bad news for our ideals and our pocketbooks.
Beyond the argument for representative democracy, there’s plenty of data to back up the benefits of diversity. Harvard Business Review tells us that companies with a diverse workforce are 45% likelier to report growth, and McKinsey reports a linear relationship between racial diversity and financial performance. Though the government certainly is not equivalent to for-profit corporations, the benefits of a diverse workforce are nevertheless clear and substantial. And, moreover, we all have a stake in the financial performance of our government, its agenda, and its services.
Government workers structure and manage programs for the poor like transitional assistance and Medicaid, legal services and affordable housing. Take a look at the kinds of life experiences are shaping that process: It makes sense for those who’ve relied on government programs in the past to have a strong voice in shaping them for the future. Further, people from various regions will bring up different concerns while drafting state or national policy. We miss out on geographic diversity of staff when those who can’t afford to rent apartments in major cities on a nonexistent salary lose an opportunity to enter public service.
Paid internships are not only fair but also beneficial for our democratic government. In order to employ the best and brightest in public service, it must be possible for students of all backgrounds to work in government on summer breaks. Paying government interns would bring America closer to a democracy that is truly of the people, by the people, and for the people.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The U.S. Olympic Committee and Boston 2024 organizers terminated Boston’s bid to host the 2024 Olympic Games on Monday following several months of backlash and major changes to the bid that first touted the role local colleges, including Harvard, would play in hosting events.
Boston 2024 Chair Steve Pagliuca said in a joint statement with Boston 2024 that the “extensive efforts required” for the bid would make it difficult for the U.S. to compete against bids from other countries. U.S. Olympic Committee CEO Scott Blackmun cited the lack of support from Boston residents in a statement, as well.
The news that Boston would not longer seek to host the Games broke just hours after Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh said at a press conference that he would not commit to signing a host city contract stipulating that taxpayers would cover cost overruns.
 Since January, the bid has met continued skepticism from Boston residents, including the creation of an entire organization dedicated to criticizing and scrutinizing the bid.
The evolving role of Harvard and other local universities in the bid became a focal point in the Olympic debate as detractors questioned whether organizers had overstated the school’s commitment to the Games. Originally, Harvard figured heavily in the Boston 2024 plans, with Crimson facilities slated to host up to 10 events. More recent documents released from organizers, however, indicated that Harvard would only host archery, a large downsize from the original plans, which heralded Harvard and other universities as central to the bid.
Throughout the short-lived bid process, Harvard also publicly kept its distance from the Olympic plans. Harvard Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp, initially noted as a member of the Boston 2024 executive committee, dropped her affiliation with the effort. And in February, University President Drew G. Faust said Harvard would not allocate fundraising resources to help the bid.
University spokespeople declined to comment Monday.
