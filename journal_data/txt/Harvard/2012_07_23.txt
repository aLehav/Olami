After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CÚCUTA, Colombia—More than 3 million citizens have been displaced during the past decade of Colombia’s armed conflict, around 120,000 in Norte de Santander, a state that lies on the country’s border with Venezuela. As part of a series for the magazine at which I’m interning, I went with an editor to the barrios just outside of Cúcuta, the state’s muggy capital, where many of these displaced people have recently settled.
At first I was nervous: no one had been told in advance that we were coming, and they had no idea who we were—why would they let us photograph and videotape them? My Colombian editor seemed unconcerned.
He began taking pictures of a girl playing in her backyard. When her mom came out, I turned away instinctively, and pretended to film another area. But she invited us in, offered food and drinks, and posed for photos. “Mommy’s going to be on TV,” her daughter said.
Gradually, I grew more comfortable, filming a pair of girls playing on the street, who smiled and posed. A little boy giggled as he showed me the bunk-bed on which he slept in his one-room house. By the refrigerator, his father smiled.
During my time in Latin America, I had looked at these people—their bright, crumbling houses; their dark, wrinkled faces; the rivers in which they bathed—and seen poverty and sadness. But they didn’t.
“We’re happy,” one man said as he sat in front of his house. Displaced by paramilitary troops in 2007, he had settled in this shantytown and begun making leather shoes and sandals, which he sells for six to seven dollars at the Venezuelan border. “My family and I,” he continued, motioning with his knife toward the back room, where his son watched TV, “we’re alive, we’re complete, and that’s what matters.”
At the end of the day, we noticed a woman, a shirt over her head for shade against the sun. She was heading to a bus stop to meet her son from soccer practice—a two-hour journey uphill—so we gave her a lift. She sat by the window, and recounted in a flat tone her recent displacement by paramilitaries, who had killed her brother-in-law.
I was photographing houses alongside the road.  I reached over to take pictures out her window, and asked her to press the black electronic button to roll it down. “How?” she asked.
We came from different worlds: she didn’t know how car windows open, basic aspects of her life were foreign to me. Just as I saw people like her initially as an objective representation of poverty, they could have seen me as an objective representation of American privilege. They seemed not to: by sharing their thoughts, by inviting me into their homes, they demonstrated acceptance of me as a human being—someone from an entirely different culture perhaps, but someone who could understood common emotions, of sadness, love and hope. Through simple human interaction, both our worlds had become larger.
As we neared the bus stop, my editor told her how much he liked her town. It must be a nice place to live, he said.
“Yes, sir,” she said. “I think so too. I hope.”

FLORENCE, Italy—Maybe it’s the gelato talking, but I think I’m in love—in love with the city of Florence.
“Do people actually live here?” one of my friends asks the first afternoon we spend in the city once ruled by the Medici family. I understand her meaning; the city is so beautiful and charming and convenient that it seems like a city made for tourism. There aren’t any of the high-rise apartments here, like the ones in Rome, or the abundance of people dressed in suits on their way to work, like in Paris. or any markers of day-to-day inhabitance, such as schools, playgrounds, hospitals, and other things of the sort.
Florence is a place that seems to be made for tourists yet doesn’t go out of its way to make one feel particularly like a tourist. The best way I can describe this feeling is as if you paid somebody to be your friend, but the paid friend was so good at his or her job that you forgot that you had paid them to be your friend.
And oh, what a friend Florence is.
Birthplace of the Renaissance, Tuscan capital, referred to as “Firenze” by the Italians, her cobblestone paths are charming and welcoming, with a gelato store on every corner. (Side note: There is not enough adequate warning about the dangers of gelato for potential visitors to the city. After performing some careful calculations, I’ve determined that gelato accounted for 1/3 of my budget while in Europe and 100 percent of my weight gain.)
One night, after crossing the Ponte Vecchio, or “old bridge,” to get across the glimmering Arno River, we slowly meander past the small, colorful shops, which line the bridge and have been closed for hours already. After our fifth gelato stop of the day, we find ourselves in a small alley with few people. There is nothing spectacular about this narrow street, and walking behind two of my friends chatting away about nonsensical things, it almost feels like I live here despite having only arrived this afternoon. It is a crazy sentiment not felt very often in many of the other places I have visited and never after so short a period of time.
However, we soon come to a display of Florentine paintings meant for tourists, bright, colorful, and factory-line mass-produced, that I had seen lined along almost every street and in front of every vendor’s stand. It struck me then, just as I was about to lay claim to Florence and her friendship, that I was still just a tourist and this city—no matter how convincing—was catering to my whims.

CAIRO, Egypt—The city is swarmed by people of all walks of life. Sitting in a café, smoking sheisha while drinking mint tea in Khan el-Khalili, Cairo’s most famous souq, often feels like paying a visit to the Mos Eisley Cantina (the bar in Tatooine from Star Wars: A New Hope for those who were wondering). I have spent hours sitting in the souq watching burqa-clad women hustle to prayers, young children try to sell me silver bracelets and German tourists struggle to haggle for sheishas using a combination of broken English, Arabic and German. But nothing beats the excitement of crossing the road in Cairo, a city in a constant state of rush hour and completely devoid of pedestrian crossings. Taxis race down the roads at breakneck speeds, and will only stop to convince you to change your course and to visit his friend’s perfume store or to book a camel ride through him.
But with the excitement also comes a touch of reality. Grand old colonial-style buildings, the legacy of Britain’s Mandate over the country, are surrounded by crumbling, unfinished empty buildings thanks to failed public housing projects. The streets are full of desperately poor children, who beg you to buy packs of tissue for a mere pound (USD 15 cents), enough to let them survive the night. While the sons and daughters of Egypt’s richest park their Lamborghinis in the garage of the American University in Cairo, people continue to fill Tahrir Square after Friday evening prayers to demand social and economic equality. The coffee shops are constantly packed with young men, fresh out of university, who cannot find a job due to the limited economic opportunities Egypt has to offer. My Coptic teacher occasionally bursts into tears in the middle of class at the prospect of her children being persecuted by Muslims under the new regime. The biggest lesson I have learned is that Egypt is not all pyramids and temples— this is a country that desperately wants to escape from the inequalities of the past and forge itself a new identity.

NAFPLIO, Greece—Scampering around the main square in Nafplio, the adorable mutt surveys his grounds before stretching out for a nap under the shade of a nearby statue. He is technically a stray, but he belongs to the square. Waiters feed him their leftover meat, parents let their children play with his floppy ears, and shopkeepers offer their stoops for his naps. He doesn’t bark, snarl, or whimper. With his mouth stretched in a goofy grin, this pooch beams all day long.
He has every reason to be that happy – Nafplio is idyllic. It sits on the water’s edge, filled with cafés, shops, and bars. As I write this article, I am sipping on an icy frappé in a taverna that overlooks the ocean. It is hard not to become consumed by my daydreams, picturing myself just staying here forever.
In fact, the city has inspired a new game among the Harvard students here. It’s simple—we finish the sentence “maybe I’ll stay in Nafplio, and….” Some say that they would work in the Paintings on Old Wood shop, which sells (you guessed it) paintings on old wood, while others dream of buying their own boat to sail in the Aegean Sea. Strangely, the game has slowly evolved into finishing the sentence “maybe I’ll stay in Nafplio, adopt that dog from the square, and…” There is something especially appealing about that cheerful mutt, so content with his simple life in a picturesque town.I won’t stay in Nafplio. I could be happy here, but I know that come September I will be back at Harvard, and this carefree lifestyle will seem distant. But next year, as I toil away in Lamont among a sea of Harvard’s stressed out overachievers, I hope I’ll remember that happiness can be rooted in simplicity; sometimes, a cold frappé and good dog are all you need.

PARIS, France—I began this summer with two dreams.
Dream One was spending a summer in Paris, the city of Light, Love, and Inevitable Self Discovery Not To Mention Transmogrification Into A Substantially More Sophisticated Human Being. Like so many bright-eyed Americans before me, buoyed by four years of high school French and a love of all things aesthetic, I was easy pickings for Parisian Cupid’s bow and arrow. I bought my plane ticket and checked it twice, three times, ten times, just to make sure the confirmation email was real and not a cantankerous reply from my biology TF.
Dream Two was making the most of my first voyage to Europe, to drink in this storied landscape so lush and magical compared to my own. I made a list of countries – the classic Eurotrip additions of England, Spain, and Italy, plus the equally alluring Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, and Luxembourg. I bought my Eurail pass and spent sleepless nights before my departure hungrily scanning my map, plotting itineraries and imagining destinations.
Finally, I arrived in Paris. I resolved not to jet off right away, in order to give us some well-deserved and long-awaited alone time. To get to know each other, to find out all the basics that you can’t get when your long distance relationship rests on a foundation of late night Wikipedia and Flickr searches. Favorite food, favorite color, favorite monuments were essential, sure—but I also wanted specific secrets, precious lover’s stones I could hold in my hand: favorite pastry, most savory salad, most flattering shade of green, best place to sit by the Seine. I spent hours wandering the city, tenderly assessing each arrondissement, finding the answers to the above when I least expected it (pain au chocolat, hot goat cheese salad, dark forest sea green with a splatter of teal like the awning of the grocery next door, Pont Neuf—the tip of the Île de la Cité). Month one passed without even the thought of venturing away from Paris.
Month two began when a travel bug bit me sharply on the ankle, where I would feel the itch each time I took a step. I spent a long hour in line at Gare Montparnasse and an even longer hour reserving trains for the next four weeks. I returned to my apartment, thick folder of tickets in hand, ready to soothe the wandering sting.
Then, the inevitable happened. Morning after morning, I would silence my alarm, sling my tote bag over my shoulder, and head triumphantly towards the train station. Then, I would catch a glimpse of Parisian sky peeking out from behind the morning haze, and think to myself, “You know, they say there’s nothing like seeing Nôtre Dame for the fifty-sixth time” or “Why am I suddenly craving a free massage from those inscrutably kind-hearted folks in front of the Sorbonne?” Tickets would tumble to the floor, and my feet would take me to the edges of Paris and back again, wearing down the travel-bite until the pang was muffled by the salve of rosy sunsets and savory crepes.
As it turns out, two dreams is one too many. Paris is a needy mistress, and let’s be honest, the feeling is shamelessly requited.

FLORENCE, Italy—Another art happens in the people’s faces. They crane up to gaze at him, bored, amazed, glazed-over. I ask the khaki-suited man who works here what it’s like. He shrugs, uninterested. “Io, e lui,” he tells me. “Sempre lui.” Me, and him. Always him. He gestures to the crowds around the lui in question with a sloppy motion of his salt-and-pepper head. “È troppo casino,” It’s too much chaos, he says.
The guy wanders off to his lunch break and I am left with lui himself, who is marble and won’t tell me anything, and those who stare up at him, who are made of flesh and skin. It is a casino, I think, some of it—after ten weeks of travel, two months of which as a travel writer, I have grown sick of the guidebooks and lines and endless repeated conversations, the forced merrymaking and illusory “authentic,” all the tired tropes that travel inevitably brings.
Yet I am touched, suddenly, by the incredible tenderness of the tourists’ arm muscles, the veins in their hands. There is a craftsmanship to their neck sinews I can only see now as they crane their necks as children might, when looking at a sky of stars. Even here tired and half-heartedly, more out of obligation than poetry, as some undoubtedly are, they are more finely wrought in their sunburn than the marble David, a tepid curiosity on their upturned faces, soft throat-skin and thrown-back heads.

CORRIENTES, Argentina—Have you ever seen a carpincho, also known as a capybara? Well as of now, neither have I.
It all started when I heard that we were going to visit the wetlands in Corrientes.
I am by no means a fan of any animal that is in the rodent family. Numerous scarring stories about mice line the shelves of my life, and don’t even get me started on a brief escapade with two pet gerbils, Fred and George. In short, rodents and I do not mesh well.
Nevertheless, when I heard that the largest rodent in the world lives in South America—and it can be found in Corrientes, no less—I knew that my heart wouldn’t be complete until I saw it. With beaver-like teeth and a slight resemblance to an overgrown gopher, carpinchos are not exactly what you would call cute. Still, I thought that “seeing a carpincho” was something that deserved to be on my bucket list. However, the roads to the wetlands of Corrientes do not mesh well with downpours of rain and the police prohibited us from beginning the journey down the muddy road.
I was in Corrientes, but I wouldn’t get to see a carpincho? It couldn’t be. But hope was restored when we heard of a farm nearby with animals galore. And as fate had it, the farm even had two carpinchos.
As we entered the habitat of the carpinchos, my heart drummed in my chest. Could this be it? Would I finally get to see the largest extant rodent in the world? Would I have nightmares for many weeks to come after seeing them? We trekked around a small pond in search of the elusive carpinchos, but to little avail. The closest that I got to a carpincho was the stuffed version I saw in a museum.
Maybe I’ve never seen a carpincho, but I take it as a sign that I need to return to Argentina someday for a second chance.

IZMIR, Turkey—In Turkey, the buses are like the fruits we have for dessert on the dig compound: some are big, some are small, some smell nice, others less so. Most of all, like the fresh fruit that stays hidden until dinner, there’s the element of surprise. You come to know all of the possibilities, but you can never be certain about what to expect.
I’ve sat on a dolmuş, a shared taxi, next to a plant. I’ve thumbed through the entertainment system on a big, fancy bus and found not only Turkish pop but Madonna’s complete discography, with the filenames retaining the trademark underscores of an illegal download. I’ve ridden in a Mercedes Benz mini-bus with leather seats and working air conditioning, and many more without.
Where I find myself most often, though, is on the bus that travels from Izmir to the mid-sized town of Salihli, that slows down—almost to a complete stop—to deposit visitors to Sardis on the side of the new highway to make the trek up the hill towards the archaeological site. The company is called Güven, which means trust, and so far they seem to be like the peaches we have after lunch. They’re reliable. Consistent.
When I arrive at the Izmir otogar, the next bus is always already parked in spot number 120. The drivers and their assistants, without exception young men in crisp, short-sleeved white button-downs and red clip-on ties, stand outside the bus shouting a sing-song “Salihli! Salihli!”, pressing their tongues down on the second syllable. I tell them I’m going to Sart and they herd me towards the bus with a departure time, which I’ve since learned is in fact just an optimistic estimate. I buy a Coke, lurk in the terminal until I hear the engine turn on, and take my seat in the air-conditioned vehicle.
As soon as we leave the station, the satellite television starts playing. At first it’s the news, but somehow, as we drive eastward, reports about the Prime Minister give way to terrible Turkish soap operas. It’s a world of truly bad acting, in which eight-year-old boys lie in the hospital after their new gang tattoos ignite fevers and clueless computer nerds end up locked in car trunks. Today, a beautiful, scantily-clad bride holds a gun to her head but is talked down by her older, white-haired husband. After I rebuff the bus assistant’s offer of coffee, then tea, then Fanta, then strong kolonya,  I look up to see that it’s the white-haired husband who’s threatening suicide this time.
By now I’m watching the sun set through the rear windows of the bus, and the children begin to nod off as their mothers grow enraptured by the drama on-screen. The bus assistant, who’s learning English, comes to tell me that Sart will be the next stop.
The bus slows and I follow him down the stairs and onto the gravel, glancing up at the Sardis Acropolis and thinking about the long walk back home. He hands me my backpack from the luggage stow and I thank him.
“See you soon!” He says out in English, straightening his tie and stepping back onto the bus.
“Görüşmek üzere!” I respond with the same nicety, just as commited to practicing my Turkish.
I can’t really predict anything here, but I’m pretty sure it’s true.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical workers, which represents more than 4,600 of the University’s non-faculty staff, released an open letter last week explaining the union’s position on the most contentious topics in its ongoing contract negotiations with the University.
The letter, signed by the union’s executive board and organizing staff, comes two and a half weeks after negotiators failed to reach an agreement by July 1, when a new contract was supposed to go into effect. Although it was meant to expire at June’s end, the old contract continues to govern the relationship between HUCTW members and the University.
According to University spokesperson Kevin Galvin, negotiations will now move forward with the help of a mediator. In an emailed statement, Galvin called mediation a “positive step in the negotiations” and wrote that the University is optimistic about creating a new contract that will be beneficial for both HUCTW members and Harvard.
“We’re frustrated, but we’re not panicked,” HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger said. He said he believes mediation, which has played a role in previous HUCTW negotiations, could aid the ongoing talks.
“We’ve relied pretty heavily and regularly on that kind of help in the past,” he said.
HUCTW’s open letter focused on three areas of the negotiations in which, according to union leadership, the University has mounted “significant resistance”: salary increases, health benefits, and inclusion of workers in the bargaining unit.
According to the letter, University negotiators have responded to talk of raises with “cries of extreme caution” that reveal a disagreement between the union and the University over the extent to which Harvard has recovered from the recession of the late 2000’s.
As evidence of Harvard’s financial health, the union’s letter pointed to the University’s House renewal project, projected to cost $1 billion or more, that started construction this spring and to Harvard’s recent announcement that it would resume construction on the long-halted, expensive science complex in Allston.
“In the same way our University’s leaders clearly believe it is critical to invest in our buildings and programs, the institution needs to understand the staff as critically important contributors to Harvard’s greatness, and return to significant investment in salary growth for HUCTW members,” the letter said.
In response, Galvin wrote that the University is committed to offering “competitive wages.” He said that wages for HUCTW members have risen noticeably during the last three years.
He added, “The University has attempted to balance prudent financial planning, which allows the University to carry on its mission of research and education, with the need to arrive at a fair and equitable wage increase.” 
Jaeger, on the other hand, said that recent raises have been much smaller than raises of the past.  He said that while he understands that the whole University, including its workers, had to make sacrifices during the recession, salaries need to match the “growth mode” that Harvard is returning to.
“Our union wants very much to be reminding the University that we need to share in that growth,” Jaeger said. “It’s a very good strategic move to return to investing in the staff.”
The letter also leveled charges of “confusion and inconsistency across the University” regarding which workers are considered exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act—generally white-collar workers whose exemption makes them ineligible for overtime pay and for union membership, the letter said.
“Some hundreds of jobs are questionably classified as exempt, and staff members working in those positions are potentially being denied the benefits of inclusion in HUCTW,” the union leaders wrote in the letter.
Though the letter said that the union does not demand that this “complex issue” be resolved immediately, it warned that the University risks breaking federal law by classifying workers incorrectly.
Galvin wrote that the University is taking steps to be sure it is in compliance with the law.
Though Jaeger said that the union has not planned any “specific or dramatic action” to protest the lingering negotiations, he said that the letter’s purpose is to extend discussion about the contract deal to the broader University community.
“This is a community that cares a lot about ideas and a lot about fairness,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the MLB season grinding on, NBA summer league action wrapping up, and NFL training camps just beginning, 50 area children spent two hours learning how to play The Beautiful Game Sunday at Harvard’s Soldier Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium.
Brightly colored cones and goals of all sizes littered the FieldTurf pitch as five coaches from one of Europe’s most celebrated soccer clubs, Liverpool F.C., spent two hours under an evening sun sharing their soccer wisdom with young children from Boston, Allston, and Cambridge.
Words of encouragement and advice voiced with varied British accents jumped out over the fluctuating babble of the children ages six and up enjoying their time in the sun. The instructors taught the kids how to dribble, pass, and execute a throw-in. Then, they set them up to play a series of matches.
“We’ve realized that soccer isn’t the number one sport in America,” Liverpool Community Coach Forbes Duff said. “So our aim is to try and get the kids involved in the session touching the ball, getting some basic skills. Like any sport, if you are actively involved and you are playing then that helps with some things like obesity, fitness. It’s also good for you to do physical activity and be active.”
“Our real aim while we are in the States is just for the kids to enjoy it and want to play soccer more, and hopefully gain some little skills they can take with them to camps and when the play elsewhere,” Duff said.
Duff said that Harvard invited the team to host a clinic on its field three weeks ago, and that they gladly accepted. During their two-week trip through the US, the group also taught soccer to at-risk youth as well as blind and deaf children. The coaches also visited a local children’s hospital.
“We are delighted that the Liverpool Foundation agreed to hold a clinic for children who live in our neighboring communities,” said Christine Heenan, Vice President of Harvard Public Affairs & Communications. “Harvard has a strong partnership with Cambridge and Boston, and we are proud to host events like this, which allow our neighbors to learn from the exceptional people who often visit our campus.”
The club is here for a match against AS Roma at Fenway Park on Wednesday. The team practiced at Harvard’s Soldier Field in advance of the competition.
When the coaches aren’t in America, some teach similarly-aged children in after-school programs while others work for the club’s youth academy that has produced some of Liverpool’s top talents such as Michael Owen and Steven Gerrard.
