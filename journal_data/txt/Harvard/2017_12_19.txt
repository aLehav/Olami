“Into the Water,” Paula Hawkins’ newest thriller, takes a different path from her previous bestseller, “The Girl on the Train.” While her first thriller is a more straight-forward “who-dunnit” mystery, “Into the Water” implies that some of its supposed murders may actually have been suicides. Hawkins plays with the novel’s title by using water terminology to describe many scenes. Furthermore, the novel’s lack of likeable characters make it difficult to connect to any of them, and the problematic portrayal of suicide heavily detracts from the gripping plot.
The main mystery of the novel revolves around the inexplicable deaths of a local mother and a (seemingly) unrelated teenage girl at the legendary Drowning Pool, an area of the river where various women have died there within the same year. Police wonder if they were suicides or murders made to look like such.
While the police investigate, others in the town—especially those who were close to the victims—act in a way that creates a problematic depiction of suicide. Instead of discussing suicide as a product of mental illness, suicide is seen as an action with specific people to blame for it. Depression is ruled out almost immediately as a cause when loved ones claim the dead weren’t depressed, despite the fact that depression can often be invisible to others. The book misses an opportunity to address an important health issue.
Hawkins unfortunately relies too heavily on the unoriginal—albeit potentially interesting—use of water as imagery. At first, the imagery feels fitting considering the victims were found in a river, but it becomes cliché with overuse, like when Hawkins writes that Although initially quaint, this technique quickly gets old. Even Hawkins herself seems fed up with her own writing: “There was the water: that was it,” she writes. Aside from water imagery, general terms like “She felt bad” and “Good days and bad” reveal lazier stylistic moments, and Hawkins also relies too heavily on frank, short sentences.
However, the novel’s fatal flaw has to be the characters’ unlikeability. While the fast plot can certainly keep readers entertained, the characters are too frustrating to empathize with. They refuse to communicate despite knowing that a simple conversation would solve the entire mystery and settle conflicts between the living. This unreasonable situation is a cheap plot that might add to the mystery’s intrigue, but it significantly decreases the fun in learning each character’s backstory.
Hawkins attempts to keep her novel interesting by alternating between points of view. But because there is a sheer multitude of narrators, she ends up spreading the story too thin. With over one hundred pages left in the novel, Hawkins seems to come to a conclusion about the suspect’s identity. However, this quickly changes as the novel progresses. Because there are so many characters, all of whom are unlikeable and possible culprits. Hawkins is able to switch the blame multiple times. In theory, this sounds like an opportunity for many dramatic twists. But the novel feels more like Hawkins finished writing the book before deciding she needed to add one hundred more pages.  For any thriller, the ending is crucial to the story’s success, and with its unsatisfying conclusion, “Into the Water sinks instead of swimming.
A quick read, “Into the Water” definitely has its flaws. Overplayed references to the river lies lazy writing and while the possibility of suicide adds an extra wrinkle to the mystery, Hawkins fails to address this mental health concern appropriately. The curse of the sophomore slump holds true for Hawkins, as “Into the Water” falls short as a disappointing follow-up to “Girl on the Train.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Marlena” by Julie Buntin is a better warning about the dangers of drugs and alcohol than any high school health class could be. The book describes the life of Cat, a girl who lived a life of privilege before her parent’s divorce, and her friendship with Marlena, a girl two years Cat’s senior and heavily involved in underage drinking and drug use. When Marlena enters her life, Cat changes from a preppy school girl to someone just looking for her next cigarette. Once Marlena is found dead, less than one year after meeting Cat, Cat is never the same.
This novel shows more than just the obvious effects of drugs and alcohol—such as rotting teeth and overdosing—that are so often used to scare teens away from these bad habits. “Marlena” describes how these vices can both end a life too soon and also shape another life forever. Buntin provides readers with a full view of Marlena and Cat’s lives as teenagers getting drunk and high, intermittently interrupted by glimpses of Cat as an adult with a steady job and a husband. Although the most depressing parts of the novel are those that detail Marlena and Cat’s antics—which involve drinking and smoking instead of taking part in healthier teenage activities such as going to school—Buntin makes sure to emphasize the lasting effects of drugs and alcohol, which are dismal at best, in her depiction of Cat, who still struggles with alcohol as a grown woman, even after Marlena’s influence is long gone.
Buntin is not afraid to hit the reader over the head with her message. One night when the two girls are drunkenly talking, Marlena admits to Cat that “her life felt like a sentence, that it had been barreling down on her since she could first speak, that it really wasn’t much of a life at all.” Smoking and drinking influence Cat long after Marlena’s death. During their time together, Cat struggles with her self-image and constantly compares her body to Marlena’s. As an adult, Cat is still an alcoholic. Despite the fact that her husband disapproves, she still wakes up in the morning “already imagining the moment, that late afternoon turn, when it would again be appropriate to drink.” This portrayal of the future of those who partake in drinking and drugs in high school is the scariest part and one often left out of typical discussions during health class lectures condemning these activities. Since the entirety of the novel deals with issues of drugs and alcohol as well as their negative effects, there is no way for the reader to escape the dismal existence of Cat and Marlena. Buntin forces the reader to see how these vices can ruin lives.
Buntin also effectively addresses other issues adolescents face by depicting certain scenes in an uncomfortably intimate way, particularly as Cat struggles with her developing sexuality. Cat was a virgin before she met Marlena. Marlena, in turn has sex with her boyfriend and trades sexual favors with a man her father’s age in exchange for pills and cigarettes, which leads to Cat feeling childish in comparison. Though she initially looks forward to her first sexual encounter, when it finally happens with Marlena’s ex-boyfriend, the scene is painfully awkward. Cat describes being “ashamed of desire writ large, of [her] body, of his body, of the dumb way we were moving, of what Marlena would think if she saw, of the fact that I didn’t much want this.” Buntin is clearly making this scene excruciatingly uncomfortable on purpose in order to portray the issues that arise when girls begin to experiment sexually in a toxic environment riddled with drugs.
Throughout the novel, Cat employs a simple, but effective, inner-dialogue. Buntin writes these scenes with short sentences that are wrought with pain. In one poignant moment, Cat thinks, “The thing is, Marlena, I’ve messed a lot up. But every day I get to try again.” Because the reader has access to the inner thoughts of a grown-up Cat, Buntin is able to write with a nostalgic style that is emotional, yet simplistic.
Buntin’s greatest achievement is writing a story through the eyes of a teenager in a style that feels true to Cat’s young age without sounding childish. Buntin easily portrays Cat’s insecurities and her desire for Marlena’s attention without coming across as whiny. Cat describes Marlena as “abrupt in a way [she] always associate[s] with rude people, but bestow[s] a kind of brightness on whatever [catches] her interest—if it happen[s] to be you, nothing felt more sublime.” Due to Buntin’s mature writing style, “Marlena” is perfect for an adult audience despite the fact that stories starring teenagers are often relegated to the Young Adult genre.
“Marlena”’s painful story works because it is also brutally honest. It successfully scares off teens who are tempted by drugs and alcohol but does not feel preachy because Buntin never tells her readers to avoid this lifestyle. She simply gives a clear portrayal of the different effects that drugs and alcohol can have on those who abuse these substances. It just so happens that these portrayals can scare anyone, especially a young person, who is considering trying drugs or excessively drinking.
