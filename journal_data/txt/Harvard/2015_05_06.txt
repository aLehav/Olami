After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A fire is raging in America. I do not mean a burned out CVS or flaming police cars. I mean the seemingly interminable blaze of structural racism that allows a black man in police custody to have his spine severed. It is the hot ember that justifies the shootings and chokeholds and senseless beatings of countless unarmed black men, women, and children by police officers in this country. It is the inferno that has made black skin a proxy for criminality and incarcerated African-Americans at a higher rate than South Africa’s black population at the height of apartheid.
And how tragic it is that so many in the United States, perhaps better than the people of any other country, have refused to acknowledge that this underlying racism with roots dating back four centuries even exists. They do this when they declare our country post-racial because our president is black. They do this when they condemn the urban black poor even as public school systems remain segregated and unequal, as infrastructure decays, and as gentrification, white flight, and redlining intensify structural poverty.
But every now and then, as in Baltimore last week, and in Ferguson last year, reactive violence to structural racism is laid bare for all to see.
Often, in any discussion about racism and violent reactions to it, those who refuse to acknowledge any legitimacy among the rioters invoke the memory of Martin Luther King, Jr. They remind us that King was committed to nonviolence, while ignoring that he was as equally committed to justice. They remind us that King once said, “Nonviolence is a sword that heals.” But they don’t mention that he also said, “Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.” They forget that he said, “A riot is the language of the unheard.”
Using the King legacy to condemn the actions of those oppressed souls in Baltimore is misguided. King would not have advocated for rioting or looting, but he surely wouldn’t have condemned those in Baltimore for doing so. The real Martin Luther King, Jr., beyond the storybook images of his “I Have a Dream” speech, was a man who first and foremost possessed a supreme and radical commitment to justice. He demanded justice as much as all those people on the streets of Baltimore and Ferguson demand justice.
"True peace is not merely the absence of tension; it is the presence of justice," King said.
We should always celebrate those brave souls who remained committed to nonviolence in the 1950s and 1960s to secure fundamental freedoms for people of color today. Without their sacrifices, people of color would still not be able to drink from any water fountain, eat in any restaurant, stay in any hotel, sit in any part of the bus, vote, or attend previously all-white schools without the fear of being killed. But even if rioters use violent means that we do not approve of, we should seriously consider the factors and structures that are leading them to such extreme measures.
After all, the problem we are confronted with today, embodied by the underlying violence and despair in our society exposed in Baltimore, Ferguson, and so many other cities, is in some ways a deeper and more difficult problem to root out. Structural racism has allowed 1.5 million black men to go missing in this country. Structural inequalities continue to devastate communities of color across this land. The difference is that there are no more easily seen "white only" signs or Jim Crow laws to point to. It has thus become easy for many to believe that America is the land of equal treatment and equal opportunity for all people, even as the suffering quietly call for change in their midst.
Until last week, quiet, nonviolent cries for change in Baltimore fell mostly on deaf ears. Now that the peace has been violently disturbed in Baltimore, maybe more of us will finally begin to listen.

The conviction of Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has weighed heavily on the people of Boston as his trial moves into the sentencing phase. The most crucial part of that discussion has been whether Tsarnaev should be sentenced to death. At a time like this, it’s more important than ever to step back and consider the implications of the death penalty. While there are innumerable arguments against it, its immense economic burden and the way lethal injection obscures the brutality of the act are particularly salient.
While intuitively it might seem that the death penalty would be an economical alternative to keeping prisoners incarcerated for their entire lifetimes, this idea has proven empirically false. Studies have shown that executing a prisoner actually costs more than keeping him in prison for his entire life. According to a 2003 legislative audit in Kansas cited by Amnesty International, the median cost of a death penalty case is $1.26 million. A non-death penalty case costs $740,000. In Maryland, death penalty cases cost three times as much as non-death penalty cases. In California, eliminating the death penalty would save the state more than $100 million a year.
Those huge differences comes from the frequency of time consuming appeals, trials that take nearly twice as long when the death penalty is sought, and from the long duration of time that prisoners spend on death row before their eventual executions. In 2012, inmates waited an average of almost 16 years before their executions. In 2014, only 35 criminals were executed while the number of death row inmates climbed to 3,019. The death penalty is a horribly inefficient institution and will only worsen as the number of inmates rises while the number of executions falls. This is of course not a plea for a faster and more efficient death penalty system. The existence of the death penalty has frightening implications for our entire justice system.
Recently Utah governor Republican Gary Herbert approved the use of the firing squad as the state’s official backup method if lethal injection drugs are unavailable. This is particularly relevant because those drugs are currently largely unavailable in Utah and in many other states after several European manufacturers (opposed to their use in executions) declined to supply them. As states begin to look for alternative execution methods, the reality of the death penalty system becomes frighteningly clear when the veil of lethal injection is removed.
The use of intravenous injections of drugs in executions conflates medicine with punishment. Witnessing an execution is very similar to witnessing a patient being anesthetized before surgery. The use of the firing squad eliminates this problem. If we as a society are going to execute prisoners, people must be able to clearly tell exactly what is happening in that act. The brutality of the sentence must not be obscured. People who support the death penalty must see it for what it really is: The intentional killing of another human being. If death by firing squad is considered too brutal, we have therefore been taking death by lethal injection too lightly. Shrouding that fact in a procedure that seems nearly medical helps no one.
Outside of considerations about the moral aberration that is the death penalty lie arguments that all sides of the political discourse could embrace. Conservatives who preach small government and balanced budgets could save individual state governments hundreds of millions of dollars. Liberals might be moved by studies that have shown that only 40 percent of Democrats are in favor of the death penalty compared to seventy-one percent twenty years ago. Eliminating the death penalty is an initiative that both political parties could support together. As the potential for common ground between political parties shrinks smaller and smaller, this issue is one on which bipartisanship could create change. As a society, we must eliminate the death penalty in order to create the kind of justice system the United States so desperately needs.

Though the issue of recognizing same-sex marriage has largely been considered on a state-by-state basis in years past, it has recently morphed into a national topic. Last week, the Supreme Court heard oral a­­rguments over whether gay marriage is a constitutional right; onlookers from both sides scrutinized the proceedings and the words of the nine justices in an effort to gauge their thoughts and forecast the Court’s decision. With a ruling anticipated by early summer, the four consolidated cases the Court heard—including Obergefell v. Hodges—have the potential to reshape a prominent debate. We hope that the Court extends the national right to same-sex marriage as a matter of both principle and political pragmatism.
As The Crimson has previously opined, same-sex marriage should be constitutionally protected. This stance has not changed; the Supreme Court should rule in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage at the national level. Equal protection under the law requires states to recognize these relationships, and not doing so brings unjust harm to couples. No instance of this is more potent than Jim Obergefell, the case’s lead plaintiff, being unable to list himself on the death certificate of his deceased husband. Same-sex marriage should be recognized as a basic right rooted in our nation’s value of equality—it is the duty of the Court to uphold this principle where states have failed.
Such views have spread rapidly in recent years. In fact, one poll found that public opinion today in Alabama, the state currently least friendly towards same-sex marriage, matches that of the country’s friendliest state, Vermont, ten years ago. Since they were first legalized in Massachusetts in 2004, same-sex marriages have become permissible in 36 other states. And with 63 percent of Americans viewing gay marriage as a constitutional right, it seems likely that the trend will eventually extend to all state legislatures.
However, this does not mean that the Supreme Court should refrain from making a decision and instead allow states to continue deciding individually. As Chief Justice John Roberts said in 2013, “political leaders are falling over themselves to endorse” same-sex marriage. This marks a political wave that will continue to push with ever more force until gay marriage is a nationally recognized right. We hope that the Court stands on the favorable side of history and deems gay marriage constitutionally protected.
Further, even though public sentiment has moved increasingly in favor of same-sex marriage, a positive decision by the Supreme Court would nevertheless hold greater meaning—the Court's choice would surely be significant not only in a technical sense, but also in a symbolic one. Given the inevitability of future contentious debates on other important, related issues, the Court has an opportunity with its decision here to set precedent, and equally importantly, to dictate the tone of the conversation moving forward.

In an upcoming initiative, the Harvard Mediation Program at Harvard Law School would help mediate complaints levied by civilians against Boston Police Department officers, according to Rachel A. Viscomi, the assistant director of the Harvard Negotiation & Mediation Clinical Program at the Law School.
The Mediation Program is a subsection of the broader Harvard Negotiation and Mediation Clinical Program. Under this new initiative, trained Law School students and local residents would bring together civilians and police officers to address more moderate disputes, including complaints such as rudeness or unprofessional police conduct, and more serious complaints would continue to be addressed through the Internal Affairs division at the BPD, according to the Boston Globe.
“Mediation provides an opportunity to engage and potentially repair individual instances of hurt and misunderstanding, helping to strengthen connection and understanding between police officers and the communities they serve,” Viscomi wrote in an email.
Viscomi wrote that the Boston Police Department reached out to the Law School program about the initiative, though, as the initiative has yet to begin, many  details of the program remain undecided. She added that the number of Law School students involved in mediation will depend on the number of cases the program receives. The Mediation Program requires a “32-hour basic training,” according to Viscomi.
Just when the Law School program will begin mediating complaints for the Boston Police Department remains unclear.
“I expect it will be implemented as soon as makes sense without compromising the quality of the program,” Viscomi wrote.
The BPD did not respond to a request for comment.

In response to a blog that started posting alleged membership lists of Harvard’s all-male final clubs last week, a similar blog has launched listing members of all-female final clubs. 
Last week, an anonymous Tumblr, entitled “Hey There Harvard, I’m In A Final Club,” began publishing the names of alleged members of Harvard’s male unrecognized final clubs. On Thursday, most of the comments, but not the posts which claimed to list club rolls, were taken down in an effort to remove “undue negative tone or bias,” according to a post on the site.
The blog quickly came under criticism for not including any similar rosters for the female final clubs. The only post beyond the lists remaining on the site explains the reasoning behind this decision.
“[T]hey are all less than 30 years old and by all accounts have negligible influence of the social scene here...none of them own property (though quite a few rent and one of them does throw parties occasionally at that rented property) and...we don’t have the names!” reads the post.
In response, another blog was launched late last week entitled “Hey There Harvard, I’m In A Final Club Too.”
One post on the newer blog argued that the original blog “gives the impression that the makers of this site do not feel as though female final clubs should have an equal role in discussing matters of inclusivity.”
“It’s time to recognize female and male spaces as equally important spaces on this campus,” the post continues.
More than a dozen students listed on the site as female final club members did not respond to requests for comment.
Both blogs currently do not allow for questions or comments. They do, however, contain submission sections where students with Harvard college email addresses can offer additional names. Both blogs says that all contact with the sites will be treated as anonymous.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The nonprofit pro bono legal group Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice has filed a motion to intervene in support of Harvard in an ongoing lawsuit that accuses the University of discriminating based on race in its undergraduate admissions practices.
The motion, dated April 29, cites as its movants nine prospective students intending to apply to Harvard and five current students at the College, all of whom “have present or prospective interests in living and studying in a racially diverse environment.” The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice gathered input from Harvard students at an off-the-record meeting in late April before filing.
The legal defense group Project on Fair Representation launched the lawsuit against Harvard last November with a 120-page complaint alleging that Harvard sets “target percentages” for underrepresented minorities and illegal quotas on students of Asian descent in its undergraduate admissions processes.
In its proposal to intervene, however, the Lawyers’ Committee contends that Harvard should remain free to address the underrepresentation of Native Americans, African-Americans, and Latinos in its admissions practices. The motion defends the consideration of diversity in assembling a student body, arguing that reducing the population of underrepresented minorities would “reduce the exposure of all Harvard students...to peers with different racial or ethnic experiences from their own.”
Because of its “unique reputation” and “unique financial aid program,” the motion continues, Harvard is “particularly well-suited to advancing the goal of racial and ethnic diversity.” Moreover, the motion argues that were Harvard to be barred from considering race in its application process, other universities would likely follow suit, with “catastrophic” effects for underrepresented minorities applying to higher education.
The motion does not unequivocally endorse Harvard’s admissions policies, however. The group argues that the College’s consideration of legacy status, standardized test scores, and early action applications “may have a negative impact on Native American, African American, and Latino students.”
The Lawyers’ Committee wrote in the motion that its movants, some of whom are current College students, can provide personal experiences with race and ethnicity on campus that Harvard, as an institution, cannot. The motion argues that Harvard may be unwilling to offend “alumni, faculty, the academic community, or the public” by acknowledging its past history of discrimination or addressing ongoing problems with race relations on campus.
While the University may be nominally affected by changes in affirmative action policy, current and prospective students would suffer personally and “should not be required to entrust their interests” to Harvard’s legal defense, according to the motion.
At a meeting in court last week between Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions—the plaintiff in the lawsuit—a judge determined that the case would include a 10 to 12 month discovery period.
Both Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions plan to file a response to the intervention in the coming weeks, representatives from both parties said at the meeting last Thursday.
Representatives from the Lawyers’ Committee and several student movants declined to comment on the filing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Committee on the Oversight of Electronic Communications found that a controversial attendance study conducted last spring did not violate the University’s Policy on Access to Electronic Information, according to a memo presented by University President Drew G. Faust on Tuesday.
The memo, which was presented to members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at their last monthly meeting of the year, nevertheless offered suggestions to what it described as often unclear University policies surrounding photography and video around campus.
After a question raised during a faculty meeting last November, Vice Provost for Advances in Learning Peter K. Bol confirmed that he authorized a study last spring that photographed students without their or the professor’s consent. The next week, Bol informed thousands of students that they were photographed.
Harvard Initiative for Learning and Teaching researchers Samuel T. Moulton ’01 and Erin Driver-Linn, who helped conduct the study, later in the month said that HILT researchers had photographed 29 courses in total for the study and that all images had been destroyed.
In November, Faust submitted the study to Harvard’s one-year-old Committee on the Oversight of Electronic Communications for review and comment.
“So far as the Committee is aware, there is no comprehensive University policy in place for addressing these issues, nor perhaps even clear awareness of what policies are in place or are not in place,” the memo read.
The memo suggested that researches try to notify students before a study starts. In instances where advanced notification “would undermine the validity of a vitally important study that could not be performed without such notice,” students should receive prompt notices after the study commences.
At Tuesday’s Faculty meeting, Faust said she accepted and will act on the recommendations of the memo.
“Acknowledging that the continued proliferation of technology would likely continue to generate additional need for reflection, the Committee also recommended that my office, or that of the Provost, work to facilitate ongoing discussion of these matters,” she said.
In general, the memo mentioned a need for balance between students’ privacy and professors’ autonomy in the classroom and institutional research.
“Inevitably there is a tension between the University's establishment of classroom space as a locus of free and open discourse and its use of classrooms as ‘laboratories’ to study teaching and learning,” the memo read.
The end of the memo detailed several changes already enacted since the fall. Any proposed research on Harvard students is now “automatically [to] be subjected to greater scrutiny” by the University’s Committee on the Use of Human Subjects. Additionally, a research organization is being formed within the Office of the Vice Provost for Advances in Learning to oversee “learning-related” research at Harvard.
Harvard Law School professor John C. P. Goldberg chairs the electronic oversight committee, which was formed after the suggestion of another oversight committee in the wake of news that administrators had searched resident dean email accounts during the 2012 Government 1310 cheating scandal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council voted to request administrative reviews of the recent decision to change the body overseeing the Bureau of Study Counsel from University Health Services to the College at its last general meeting of the semester on Sunday.
The UC formally requested all “internal and external” reviews from administrations regarding the decision to shift the BSC’s governance, as well as “all other information elucidating the basis” for their decision.
According to the legislation sponsored by UC Parliamentarian Jacob R. Steinberg-Otter ’16, several Council representatives felt that the basis for the University’s decision to shift the BSC’s purview was unclear, and that the Council needed to “better understand the basis” for the shift.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris announced last month that the BSC, currently a part of UHS, would report administratively to the College starting in July. Since the shift was announced, students have raised concerns about the potential loss of privacy that might come with the move.
At the meeting, representatives also voted to amend the UC’s constitution and bylaws for the third time this semester, establishing the Student Faculty Oversight Committee as one of the Council’s standing committees. The committee will be charged with increasing the collaboration between the UC and Student Faculty Committees, according to the legislation amending the constitution.
The Council currently has 16 Student Faculty Committees, with a total of 72 undergraduate representatives sitting on those committees.
The 16 committees were placed under review by the Council’s Evaluation Task Force late last month. At last week’s general meeting, Steinberg-Otter and Rules Committee Chair Brett M. Biebelberg ’16 told representatives that reviews for the committees were generally positive.
A comprehensive review of the 16 committees issued by the Student Faculty Oversight Committee, which was created late last fall semester, said that while the committees do serve a clear purpose of bridging a gap between students and administrators, there was concern raised about the “lack of student initiatives” brought forth in the committees’ meetings. The Student Faculty Oversight Committee aims to solve this by appointing a “point person” to each individual committee in order to increase their effectiveness.

Members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences voiced pointed criticisms of the College’s Program in General Education, echoing the findings of an interim report presented to them at their final monthly meeting of the semester Tuesday.
While Faculty members largely said they agree with the founding principles of the program, they denounced the program for counting departmental courses for Gen Ed credit.
Philosophy professor  Sean D. Kelly, chair of the seven-person committee charged to review Gen Ed, presented an interim report to the Faculty, characterizing the program as “failing on a variety of fronts.”
In his presentation, Kelly said that in order to be effective, the program must have fewer requirements with better taught and more focused courses, more faculty investment, and greater financial and administrative support. While the report itself suggests that the program could be completely overturned in favor of department-based distribution requirements, Kelly did not touch on that possibility in his presentation and instead asked the Faculty whether the program should be supplemented by distribution requirements, which could require students to take courses within specific divisions of FAS.
Jennifer L. Hochschild, a professor of Government and African and African American Studies who sat on the review committee, spoke against distribution requirements as antithetical to Gen Ed’s aims.
“Good Gen Ed courses are not only non-disciplinary but anti-disciplinary,” she said. “We need to think of the nature of the course, not the disciplines from which it comes.”
History professor Niall Ferguson said the report’s findings made him “angry” and that the Faculty should “collectively be ashamed” because he said the principles of the program “have been subverted on a massive scale.”
“574  courses ended up being listed as part of General Education,” Ferguson said. “To my eyes, it looked like the reincarnation of what we have been trying to replace.”
FAS Dean Michael D. Smith, for his part, said after the meeting that he sensed most members of the Faculty wished to retain and reform the program, not completely dispose of it.
The review committee will create a finalized report over the summer with additional Faculty feedback, according to Kelly. Smith said he believed this report will take the form of a proposal for changes to the program, and while he is not sure when that proposal will be brought before the Faculty, he hopes that the Faculty could legislate changes at some point next year.
Government professor Stephen D. Ansolabehere also introduced a proposal to reform the election procedures for members of the Faculty Council, the highest elected body in FAS. The new system is meant to be easier to understand and to administer, he said, noting that Faculty participation in Council elections is about 25 percent and that approximately 10 percent of the ballots are thrown out every year due to mistakes made because of the complex process.
Smith said after the meeting that he hopes that the Faculty can vote on the changes early in the fall so that it can be implemented for the next Council election in the spring of 2016.
University President Drew G. Faust presented a memorandum from the Committee on the Oversight of Electronic Communications about a controversial attendance study executed last fall, which recommended that researchers notify students and faculty of such a study before it takes place.
Smith also announced the names of five faculty members who had been named Harvard College Professors for excellence in undergraduate teaching and mentoring. The five-year professorship provides support for research, a semester of paid leave, or summer salary.
The professors who received the positions this year are History professor Maya R. Jasanoff ’96, Organismic and Evolutionary Biology professor Elena M. Kramer, English professor Louis Menand, Visual and Environmental Studies department chair Robb Moss, and Evelyn Hu, a professor of Applied Physics and Electrical Engineering.

Incoming Harvard Law School students can now participate in an online Harvard Business School “Credential of Readiness” program at a discounted price. The program will provide classes in Business Analytics, Economics for Managers, and Financial Accounting for students in the Class of 2018 at the Law School.
The program, which costs $1,800, will be available to incoming Harvard Law School students on a first-come, first-served basis for $250, according to a press release on the Harvard Law Today website. The new cross-school initiative, still in a pilot stage, will start in June and run for 11 weeks.
The CORe program is the first program of HBX, the Business School’s online educational platform, and was launched last year. In February, the range of students eligible to apply to the program was broadened to students and post-graduates around the world.
The business education offering comes after a Law School study last year showed that legal employers increasingly value a background in accounting, corporate finance, and financial statement analysis.
Jessica L. Soban ’02, the assistant dean and chief admissions officer at the Law School, was not available for comment at press time.

The China Lab at the Harvard Graduate School of Education has received a donation pledge of $100,000 to fund a research project focused on reducing academic stress in the Chinese school system, and the first installment of this promise is already “in hand,” according to those involved in the project.
The project, which will launch in July, is a collaboration between researchers at the Ed School, the University of Calgary, and the University of Jinan. The donor, Zhongping Yang, speaking through two translators, said that he felt compelled to fund this project because he hopes to help develop a more enjoyable and beneficial academic experience for both Chinese youth and students internationally.
“I feel that, as a Chinese citizen, I have this responsibility and obligation to make a contribution to this important task, ” Yang said. “The question of academic stress is not only a Chinese problem, but it’s also a problem across the world.”
According to Xu Zhao, a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Calgary and a principal at the Ed School China Lab, the academic pressure placed on Chinese students is primarily the result of the rigorous university entrance exam, combined with broader social policies and increasing global competition. She said that the research team must take these considerations into account when determining approaches for intervention policies.
“As researchers, we want to advocate for the population we try to help,” Zhao said. “Through our research, we want to inform policy makers in their decision-making.”
Ed School visiting professor and director of the Ed School China Lab Helen E. Haste, the project’s other co-investigator, said that the team will conduct a series of questionnaires, interviews, and focus groups with different Chinese student populations in order to create useful, accurate narratives to guide their approach
The project’s principal investigator Robert L. Selman, who is also a Harvard Medical School and Ed School professor, wrote in an emailed statement that he views the initiative as a long-term endeavor that will evolve into a concrete program for prevention of academic stress. He emphasized that the recommendations will be tailored to fit the cultural context of Chinese society.
“...[The intervention methods] will not be ‘parachuted into China.’ They will, by necessity, be preventive interventions with strong ‘Chinese Characteristics,’ meaning cultural issues will be among the most important for us to consider with our Chinese partners,” he wrote.
According to Selman, this is the first Ed School project involving research in China that is funded by a source outside of Harvard.

UPDATED: September 15, 2015, at 4:41 a.m.
This is part I in a two-part series about diversity in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Part II ran on May 8.
Elsie M. Sunderland, an associate professor of Environmental Science and Engineering, has two young children and is a few years into Harvard’s infamously rigorous tenure track. Her female students and postdoctoral fellows often come to her for advice on approaching a career in academia and how to balance those demands with having children, she says.
To Sunderland, having children is both physically demanding on women and cuts deeply in the ability of a faculty member who is a woman to do work, creating an “intense environment.”
“If you look around, there are very few women—I think that this is a primary reason,” Sunderland says, arguing that the intersection of these life decisions and the tenure track “does make it difficult to have a large representation from [the female] demographic.”
Sunderland is not alone in thinking that academia is, at times, daunting for women, particularly at Harvard; Less than half of women across the University surveyed in its 2013 Faculty Climate Survey reported feeling that the work environment for women is “at least as good” as it is for men.
Beyond work-life pressures, many faculty members say that the lack of representation from women in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—who in the 2013-2014 academic year made up 27 percent of FAS—can shift unique burdens onto them. Generally, women in FAS serve on more committees and often serve in more mentorship roles, according to FAS Dean for Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser.
Faculty say that the environment for women within FAS has improved in recent years as the body’s gender balance has become more evenly split and faculty members generally have become more aware of the issues women face. But the still-substantially lower number of faculty members who are women in Harvard’s flagship school results in administrative burdens and academic stresses that their colleagues who are men generally do not experience.
As Psychology professor Mahzarin R. Banaji puts it, “women are still pioneers at Harvard.”
PORTRAITS OF THE FACULTY
Two decades ago, only men were featured in the portraits that line the sea-foam colored walls of the Faculty Room in University Hall where members of FAS gather for their monthly meetings. Only in 1995, when Harvard commissioned a portrait of the school’s first tenured professor who was a woman, Helen Maud Cam, did a woman break into the ranks. And on Tuesday, when faculty members entered that room for their final meeting of the academic year, the faces of just three women looked out over the crowd alongside 30 men.
The changing gender balance of the portraits in this room is indicative of a slow but significant change in the environment for women in the faculty in the past 20 years. In that time, Harvard has seen not only a shift in demographics but a change in faculty members’ awareness about women’s issues.
In 2013 and 2014, the fraction of women in FAS increased t0 27 percent after remaining at about 25 percent since 2006. According to Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity Judith D. Singer, in the past decade, the number of tenured women across Harvard has increased by just under 100.
The increase in the total number of professors who are women was partly driven by a voluntary FAS retirement program that was instituted in December 2010 and facilitated the retirement of 75 faculty members by 2014. Of that cohort, 69, or 92 percent, were men.
But beyond the retirement program, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith says he has made increasing diversity within the Faculty a priority for his deanship. That effort has included addressing the Faculty’s gender disparity by institutionalizing formal structures to promote equitable hiring practices.
In particular, Smith appointed Banaji, the Psychology professor, in 2010 as his senior adviser on faculty development. Banaji’s academic research focuses on implicit biases—the attitudes or stereotypes that affect people’s actions and decisions in an unconscious manner—and she works with individual departments and the office of Faculty Affairs and Planning to make search committees aware of how these biases can affect the hiring process.
Additionally, Zipser says that her office and FAS’s divisional deans keep track of junior faculty candidate lists. From to time these administrators ask search committees to reconsider the candidate list if there are only men and no women on the short list of potential hires, Zipser says.
Physics Department chair Masahiro Morii says that structures to address implicit bias have been effective and that his own department has changed its hiring procedures “very recently” as a result increased awareness of these biases. Whereas the department last hired a junior faculty member who was a woman in 2005 (eight men have been hired since), this year Physics has more women than in the past on its short list of candidates, according to Morii.
Administrators and professors say these steps to improve hiring outcomes have resulted in a better gender distribution among the total FAS faculty, with gender parity in junior hire offers achieved in the 2013-2014 academic year. The whole University achieved gender parity in total junior hires in the 2014-2015 academic year.
“We are learning how to do this better,” Morii says.
WORKING ENVIRONMENT
Despite active administrative efforts to hire more women, many professors say that Harvard’s intense work environment can still be more stressful for women than men, primarily because they are fewer in number.
According to a University-wide faculty climate survey released by the Office for Faculty Development and Diversity in 2014, 43 percent of women who responded either disagreed or strongly disagreed that the climate for female faculty in their school or department is “at least as good” as for male faculty, compared to 20 percent of male faculty respondents.
Additionally, about 30 percent of respondents who were women across the University feel like they have to work harder to be perceived as legitimate scholars, according to the survey. Women are empirically more likely to be interrupted in both formal and informal settings, according to Katherine J. Hinde, an assistant professor of Human and Evolutionary Biology. Hinde was a lead author on an article on sexual harassment and assault on field research sites published last year.
Sociology professor Michèle Lamont says that she thinks a “good old boy” atmosphere used to exist in many departments at Harvard in which “powerful” men in the senior faculty would specifically seek out certain junior faculty members to mentor, usually men. While she says she thinks that atmosphere has mostly dissipated, she still senses some vestiges within departments in FAS.
Moreover, certain departments still face challenges attracting and hiring female faculty, and work environments can often be less welcoming for women, some faculty members say. In the Economics Department, for example, only two tenured faculty members are women, while 42 men are fully tenured.
This environment results in part from deference given to senior faculty members in departmental decision-making that can end up inflating gender discrepancies. While 38 percent of junior faculty across FAS are made up of women, only 24 percent of senior faculty are women.
“Seniority matters. It really, really matters,” says Ajantha Subramanian, a professor of Anthropology. “These spaces are nominally equal, but they often don’t feel that way. You take any of our department meetings, it will be the senior faculty who take up 90 percent of them.”
Beyond working in stressful environments, women are often asked to perform more “service” for a department or faculty, such as working on more committees or taking on additional advising roles, many professors and administrators say.
Zipser says that women, on average, serve on more committees than do men. She and others attribute it to the fact that departments want to diversify the perspectives of their committees but, in order to do so, must draw from the smaller pool of women.
“It’s a terrible irony that it’s out of the best intentions that sometimes more service burden is put on female faculty,” says Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Professor Elena M. Kramer, who was also chair of the FAS’s Standing Committee on Women.
Aside from official administrative duties, faculty members who are women often have to take on added informal mentoring responsibilities to students, similarly to colleagues who are underrepresented minorities, though they acknowledge not as acutely. Female students at both the undergraduate and graduate level often approach female faculty who can relate to similar experiences in academia.
“I think that very few faculty are willing to close doors—of course they’re not—which means that we’re asking them to pay a disproportionate burden of mentoring our undergraduates,” Hinde says, speaking about diverse groups more generally. “That is something that is going to inhibit equal opportunity within this institution.”
Like many other faculty members, Hinde emphasized that there is a difference of degree in the mentoring burden among diverse groups. The stress is greatly compounded for underrepresented minorities, she says, with far fewer faculty members to engage with a significant undergraduate population.
KEEPING WOMEN HERE
This often more challenging environment for female faculty can make retaining them more difficult. Some faculty and administrators say that while the University has made a concerted effort to address hiring issues, it must now focus on keeping women here once they come.
“We’re doing a better job hiring tenure track women, but we see a lot of tenure track faculty in general leave before they come up for tenure,” Kramer says. Three tenure-track women are leaving the sciences division this year before they undergo review, she says.
Though the decision to leave Harvard happens on a case-by-case basis, Kramer and other faculty members say, they agree that departmental culture, faculty mentorship—especially in cases when women are thinking of having children—and spousal hiring issues can often play definitive roles in shaping these decisions.
Banaji says that for her the “most significant” aspect of the faculty climate survey is the finding that men and women publish at the same rate and generally spend the same amount of time research, but women with children spend on average 20 more hours a week more than men do on “household duties.”
“People could ask, ‘What's going on? Who are these super women who are doing two jobs in such excellent ways?’” Banaji says.
To help alleviate the burdens of child care on faculty members who are women, Harvard has a maternal leave policy of at least eight weeks, and the University also offers parental teaching relief policies that are gender-neutral, meaning that both men and women are granted the same options for course reduction. Additionally, one-year tenure-clock extensions are automatically granted to junior faculty for each child they have or adopt on the track, but only up to two children.
While both men and women with children are eligible to receive parental leave, Banaji says that men may sometimes use that time away from teaching to work on other scholastic projects.
“If you take the leave and you're a man, even though you didn’t carry this baby, the assumption is that you are going to take that year to be deeply involved in childcare. I think large numbers of men are,” Banaji says. “It’s just as possible that others aren't. To them it could be another year to write a book, for example, even though that was not necessarily the intention of the leave.”
But these administrative policies targeted towards professors with families cannot completely mitigate the stresses of having children while pursuing a tenured position.
For Lamont, who has three children and a husband, “my own life trajectory has very much made me aware of issues like work-family balance.” She says it is a constant “dance” for faculty who are women and have families to fulfill Harvard’s expectations for its faculty and still care for their families.
Kramer adds that she believes people reviewing tenure cases must remember that junior faculty with children often do not have time to publish as quickly as their peers without children.
“Too often I heard comments like, ‘This doesn't look like a traditional tenure case,’ and we need to understand that maybe getting three papers out or whatever standard the field has, that’s not going to be the case if somebody’s had two kids, however many kids,” Kramer says. “But if you get to the end of that review period and they’ve done stellar work, and they have fantastic recognition by their peers, those two or three slow years should not matter.”
NO HOPE FOR QUICK CHANGE
These faculty climate concerns are here to stay—at least for now, many faculty say, because the Harvard simply cannot dramatically increase women's representation in the faculty immediately.
Though the University achieved gender parity in its junior hires this year, that achievement is not guaranteed in the future, as Singer and other faculty members observe. In order to make permanent change, Harvard must promote its junior faculty members who are women to the senior level, which will take time.
“You could estimate that even if we can start hiring 50-50 today, it will be 40 years before the gender balance is achieved,” says Morii, speaking specifically about the physical sciences. “But that doesn’t even happen today because the candidate pool is already skewed something like three to one.”
The quantitative reality is challenging, Morii says, at a place where the ultimate goal for professional success is a lifetime position that academics receive at about the age of 40 and often do not give up until they are 70 or older.
University President Drew G. Faust, herself the first woman to hold Harvard’s top administrative position, agrees, saying that because so much of the faculty stays from year to year, progress must be slow.
“It’s not like you can replace half the faculty and completely change its demographics in a single year,” Faust says. “I think we’ve made progress, but there’s a lot further to go.”
Problems with the representation of women in academia stem from more than simply the hiring process, however. If Ph.D. pools manifest widespread gender imbalance, universities have little hope to diversify their faculties beyond the demographics of the existing pools. According to Sheila Thomas, Assistant Dean for Diversity and Minority Affairs at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, change is still slow to come even as GSAS actively looks to recruit more women—especially in fields in which they are typically underrepresented like quantitative sciences.
Only with greater representation will committee and additional services burdens be alleviated for women. With more women in the faculty, there can be greater numbers of mentors for the younger faculty who are women, which could better help them navigate the tenure track, according to Stacey A. Combes, an associate professor of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology.
Sustained focus from senior members of departments is vital to make sure women influence decision-making even as their presence grows, says Astronomy department chair Abraham "Avi" Loeb.
“At this moment, we must give women the influence to create a fairer atmosphere,” he said.

This is part I in a two-part series on the geography of Harvard athletic recruiting. Part II ran on May 8.
For all the differences between the recruitment of athletes and regular students at Harvard, there is one overriding similarity: a target geography. For athletes and nonathletes alike, the Northeast is Harvard College’s most fertile recruiting ground.
According to data taken directly from rosters listed on the Harvard Athletics Department website from 2009-2010 to 2014-2015, roughly 38 percent of athletes included in the data set come from nearby Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Maryland, Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Delaware, Rhode Island, and Pennsylvania, while just under 5 percent come from the Southwest states of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma.
For this story, The Crimson scraped the varsity rosters from 2009-2010 to 2014-2015 listed on GoCrimson.com to create a data set of current and former Harvard athletes and their hometowns. Freshman crew athletes and students who were unlisted or listed with incomplete information were excluded from the data set.
One prominent feature in the data set was the (often disjoint) areas that different teams pulled from. Mapping the listed hometowns both highlighted recruiting hotspots and suggested regional trends; hockey players from the South were as rare a breed as volleyball players from the Midwest. Overall, California was home to the most athletes—with 15 percent of the listed players calling the Golden State home.
{shortcode-724bda8d03d173203823c87b31fd101a07ff5515}
Coaches interviewed for this story said that the distribution of athletes is a product of where talent is aggregated. For instance, more than 70 percent of players to appear on the rosters of the men’s and women’s water polo teams in the data set were from the West, but the region—comprised of Washington, Montana, Idaho, Oregon, Wyoming, California, Nevada, Utah, and Colorado—represented only about 5 percent of the men’s and women’s ice hockey teams.
Important recruiting factors, according to Harvard coaches, include connections with high school and club coaches, which can lead to a pipeline of talent. The five most popular high schools for listed varsity athletes—Phillips Academy Andover, Noble and Greenough, Phillips Exeter Academy, Deerfield Academy, and Delbarton—are all in the Northeast; each have strong connections with at least one athletic program. Good high school programs, like the Noble and Greenough women’s ice hockey team—which had eight alumni on the 2014-2015 Harvard women’s ice hockey roster—send waves of talent to Cambridge.
This isn’t to say the department limits its reach domestically. According to federal filings, Harvard spent over three-quarters of a million dollars on recruiting last year, scouring the globe for its athletes. All but two varsity teams have featured an international athlete on their roster over the last six years, and Wyoming, North Dakota, and South Dakota were the only three states without an athlete represented in the data set.
This is partly the product of a diverse set of teams—with 42 varsity athletic squads, Harvard has the most in the nation—and a wider schoolwide recruiting net. The decision to expand the financial aid program in 2004 has been widely credited with an increase in the quality of Harvard’s athletic programs, allowing them to reach areas of the country that were previously untapped.
Of the top seven states represented in the data set, five are located in the Northeast. More than one in four listed athletes call either California or Massachusetts home, and nearly one in eight comes from outside the United States.
These trends mirror those in the student body. Enrollment data provided by Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven in March indicated that over half of the Class of 2018 hails from one of four states—New York, New Jersey, California, or Massachusetts. That number barely drops for the Athletic Department, with those four top states making up about 50 percent of the athlete student body. In fact, more athletes in the data set came from New York than Texas, Florida, and Georgia combined.
But this varies significantly by team. Although no squad is made up of a majority of international students, 10 teams saw at least a fifth of their members come from beyond U.S. borders. Seven had at least 30 percent of their rosters come from California.
{shortcode-5716d7db9dffc0df0ca46ff8e22cef6e61044425}
Much of this trend is produced by the athletic prowess of the different regions, coaches say, but part of it is also produced by the academic orientation of different regions. Many of Harvard’s listed varsity athletes come from the same schools as their non-athlete peers. Of the seven high schools—Boston Latin School, Phillips Academy Andover, Stuyvesant High School, Noble and Greenough, Phillips Exeter Academy, Trinity in New York City, and Lexington High School—that combined to represent one out of every 20 Harvard students in the Class of 2017, four placed at least 10 alumni on the Harvard varsity rosters included in the data set. Milton Academy, a premier Boston private school, has sent more athletes to Harvard over the last six years than the entire states of Mississippi, Oklahoma, West Virginia, and Nebraska combined.
Fencing coach Peter Brand—whose team, as listed in the data set, had 58 percent of its members hail from the Northeast over the last six years—says that the recruiting often has as much to do with academics as athletics.
“The bottom line is that when I look at a prospect, the first thing that I look at is the academic numbers, because it doesn’t matter how good of a prospect they are, they have to have a good enough Academic Index [score],” Brand said. “It just so happens that a large number of [qualified fencers] are from the Northeast.”
Much of the curiosity about a recruit’s academics is driven by necessity; conference rules dictate a minimum academic standing that recruits must meet on the so-called 240-point Academic Index. The Athletic Department as a whole must be within one standard deviation of the student body mean—department estimates have pegged the number at Harvard to be 220, thought to be equivalent to a 2200 SAT and 4.0 GPA, although the conference does not release the precise formula.
These standards limit the pool of athletes that coaches can recruit from. In 2011, then-Brown Athletic Director Michael Goldberger estimated for The New York Times that the average college athlete “would have an [index score] of about 150.”
Another limiting factor is geography; for other sports, the numbers simply reflect where, at the club and high school level, the pipeline is strongest. Although some teams—like men’s heavyweight crew (which is almost 40 percent international students) and field hockey (almost 25 percent) recruit globally—more traditional American sports like baseball (one of the only Crimson teams without a single international player on its roster) are limited in their reach.
Harvard men’s soccer coach Pieter Lehrer has noticed this as well. While soccer is played at a high level worldwide, Lehrer’s team has had to limit its scope to remain focused in recruiting efforts.
“We really try to get more international players because the worldwide brand of Harvard is recognized everywhere in the world, and so it is very recruitable for us,” Lehrer said. “[However], it is just very difficult to cast that kind of net. That kind of travel and expense and the manpower to do that is very difficult.”
Lacrosse is the most extreme case of this phenomenon. There are 68 NCAA Division I men’s lacrosse teams, and only two are located outside of the Eastern Time Zone. Consequently, the team’s recruiting efforts are  very focused in the Northeast—more than 80 percent of both the men’s and women’s teams in the data set come from the region.
“Traditionally, when I played here in the mid-90s, half the team was from Long Island,” said Harvard men’s lacrosse coach Chris Wojcik ’96.
Indeed, not much has changed: Nearly half of the players to start a game for the men’s team in 2013-2014 came from Long Island.
Often heavy regional relationships can be driven by strong ties to individual high schools or players. Wojcik has developed connections to the Long Island programs that have produced, among others, junior attackman Devin Dwyer and senior goaltender Jake Gambitsky.
The coach said in an interview last year that although the sport is becoming more popular in other areas of the country, the intensity surrounding it on Long Island, where high school programs like Garden City and Manhasset send multiple athletes to Division I programs every year, is unique.
“People certainly move to that town simply because they want their children to play lacrosse for Garden City,” Wojcik said.
Some sports lend themselves more to establishing a pipeline than others. While sports like heavyweight crew (Belmont Hill) and women’s ice hockey (Noble and Greenough) have deep, connected high school relationships, other sports are not structured in that way.
In particular, sports that are centered around club performance at the high school level tend to be more diversified. In tennis and golf, the maximum number of players in the data set recruited from the same school over the five-year span was two.
Brand, who took more than one fencer from just two schools over the last six years according to the data set—Harvard-Westlake and Lycee Chateaubriand de Rome—said this is because he looks at players with accomplishments that go far beyond their high school records.
“It is hard to go to the same school because the best fencers don’t come from certain schools but certain programs,” Brand said. “We don’t recruit fencers who just competed in high school—those aren’t the same level as people who compete on the national or international level. We target based on their individual performances on the national and international level.”
Of course, when Brand pitches his program—which finished seventh in the NCAA this year—to recruits, he can discuss a track record of success that many others cannot. Many other coaches struggle to gain the same recruiting purchase; in the hypercompetitive world of collegiate athletics, the use of athletic scholarships, which Harvard does not offer, and an ever-increasing recruiting pool has continued to level the playing field.
Yet, according to Harvard men’s volleyball coach Brian Baise, Harvard will always be competitive—even if students have a diversity of options.
“Harvard is an amazing place, and I feel pretty good about how we generally do in that process,” Baise said. “But there are other good schools and good programs out there. Kids have a lot of good choices nowadays.”

Roster data for this story were taken directly from GoCrimson rosters (sample here). The data include only varsity athletes who were listed on a roster from 2009-2010 to 2014-2015. Athletes who were erroneously left off the roster on the website were not included in the sample, and the sample was not limited to recruited athletes.
The sample was refined to include only the sampled years because data was available for all six years for each of Harvard’s athletic teams except for two—skiing and women’s rugby. In the former case, the data were not listed on the website; in the latter, the team competed at the club, and not varsity, level until 2013. Freshman crew was not considered a varsity sport and so was left out of the analysis. The data were refined to include only athletes with complete data—athletes missing data were removed from the data set for consistency.
Using a Google-based geocoder, each athlete’s hometown was given a set of coordinates that were mapped onto a topographical map created using D3. All filtering and analysis was done in Python.
