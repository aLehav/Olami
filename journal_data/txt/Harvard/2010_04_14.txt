After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
95.3 FM WHRB (Harvard Radio Broadcast), Harvard’s open-circuit radio station, will celebrate its seventieth anniversary this week on April 15. The celebration, featuring live jazz, will unite faculty with dozens of undergraduates. The celebration marks more than a milestone for a college radio station; the anniversary represents the strength of WHRB’s intimate community and its commitment to providing quality programming for Harvard and the greater Boston area.
In an era in which laptops players have replaced a substantial portion of other music playing technology, and programs can be entirely automated, the students of WHRB are committed to incorporating a human element into their broadcasts. The studio boasts 24/7 programming during the school year, resorting only to automated shows on summer and spring breaks. Furthermore, rather than plugging their iPods into their laptops in order to generate sets from readymade playlists, the disc jockeys at WHRB remain true to their name, preferring to play vinyl over MP3 files.
For Joe A. Poirier ’11, comp director and former general manager, one of the elements of WHRB that initially drew him to the station was the extensive vinyl record collection. “I took the door through the libraries, and I saw all the music in the station, and I said ‘I have to do this.’ I have to be able to be around this music all the time,” Poirier says. Tova R. Holmes ‘11, president of WHRB, loves its collection of first- and limited-edition records, saying that about 95% of her shows are played on vinyl.
As part of the station’s effort to bring its audience the highest quality listening experience, WHRB shies away from mainstream college indie rock and Top 40. Instead, the staff prefers to occupy a niche that reaches a broader spectrum of the Boston community. The vast majority of WHRB’s weekly 70,000 listeners come from the greater Boston area. “All of our departments try to do something that is unique. All of our DJs know a lot about their specific genre... People listen to WHRB because it’s the only place they can find what they’re listening to,” Holmes says.
WHRB divides its music airtime between three major programs: Classical, Jazz, and the Record Hospital (underground rock and punk). In addition, WHRB offers news and sports broadcasts, as well as airplay for blues, reggae, bluegrass, hip-hop, electronica, and a number of other varied genres.
David R. Elliott ‘64, Chairman of the Board of Trustees for WHRB and a former disc jockey (a ‘ghost,’ as WHRB alumni are known), feels that WHRB has always been committed to excellence in programming. He explains that in the early days of the station, “commercial radio depended on the largest number of listeners, but WHRB’s intention was always to provide the best music, and the listener followed... and that holds true today.” WHRB’s first radio broadcast, which devoted its time to jazz and classical music, as well as a 15-minute news segment, abided by a formula quite similar to its modern schedule. Rock music was first incorporated into the rotation in the early 1970s.
Originally founded as WHCN (Harvard Crimson Network) in 1940, the station was managed by undergraduate Kenneth I. Richter ’43 and several of his friends from the ham radio club. According to Holmes, WHCN is the oldest continuously running college radio station in the country. Despite being initially funded by The Crimson, the radio station soon changed its name to WHRV (Harvard Radio Voice) and became a self-sufficient entity. In 1957, the station switched from closed-channel to open-channel, opening up its broadcasting to the surrounding Boston area.
In the past seventy years, the station has undergone one more name change, as well as a few shifts in location, including a move from Memorial Hall to the basement of Pennypacker Hall in 1994. A year later, it repositioned its broadcast signal from the Holyoke Center to the top of One Financial Center in downtown Boston.
WHRB boasts a number of prestigious alumni, including Hartford Gunn ’48 of Public Broadcasting Station, Daniel Raviv ’76 of Columbia Broadcasting System News, Chris Wallace ’69 of Fox News, and Alex Ross ’90 of The New Yorker. Hip-hop magazine The Source was also founded out of the hip-hop department of WHRB.
The seventieth anniversary celebration comes in the middle of an exciting Spring season for WHRB. This past weekend, it celebrated its annual Record Hospital Fest, a two-night extravaganza featuring performances by over a dozen East Coast bands that draws ghosts from all over the nation. Later this month, WHRB will host its semi-annual radio “orgies,” during which the station plays a continuous block of programming devoted solely to one artist, time period, or concept.
For those undergraduates involved in WHRB, one of the most important aspects of their college experiences has been the friendships formed from working in the radio station. When Megan E. Popkin ’11, one of the music directors for Record Hospital, reflects upon her experience at WHRB, she concludes that “everyone is doing this because they love it. They love the community and they love the people here... I think I’ve learned the most here than I’ve learned anywhere at Harvard... It’s hard to imagine Harvard without it.”

It isn’t the month of courses and activities students and community members anticipated, but the eight days of programming during J-term next year will at least be something. As announced in a recent letter by Dean of Harvard College Evelyn M. Hammonds, all students will be able to return to campus for College-led and student-initiated programming for the last eight days of J-Term. However, during the rest of Winter Break, Dec. 22 to Jan. 15, only “students with a recognized and pre-approved need to be on campus —including varsity athletes, international students, thesis writers, students conducting lab-based research and a limited number of other categories of students” will be allowed to stay in campus housing. Although we appreciate that some programming is better than none, it is still a shame that the programming for J-Term is so limited. The College should live up to its promise of providing extensive programming and the opportunity for students to do something productive over J-Term—a promise that came attendant to the calendar change.
No matter how many different types of programs will be available during next year’s J-Term, there will only be eight days of programming. This time period is too short to be conducive to a meaningful learning experience. In contrast, M.I.T.’s Independent Activities Period, conceived of in the same spirit as J-Term, is four full weeks long. This allows students to take in-depth courses such as “Kokikai Aikido for Beginners,” “CASTOR Satellite Design and Build,” “Basics of Obtaining a Patent,” and “Germany Today: Intensive Study of German Language and Culture.”
Additionally, other Harvard schools, such as the Harvard John F. Kennedy School of Government, have much more extensive programming for J-Term. HKS offers nine three-week January courses for credit, which count for spring-term course credit for all purposes.
The potential of the College’s proposed one-week experience is, in comparison, limited to a shallow understanding of the same material. Internalization of concepts, of whatever type and purpose, takes more than eight days, and thus the week threatens to be nothing more than a cram session.
Given that the College will not facilitate programming for three weeks of Winter Break, it will again be up to students to arrange their own experiences during this time. To this end, it is often easier for people who are socioeconomically advantaged to self-create compelling J-Term experiences, as such experiences may include expensive travel. J-Term is a perfect occasion to spend an extended period of time in a foreign country, become immersed in the culture to a critical depth, and return to school with expanded horizons and a broader perspective. However, without financial assistance, this type of experience is only accessible to those who can afford a thousand-dollar plane ticket on their own.
Therefore, we suggest that travel grants be made available for students. In many cases, J-Term could enable the same types of experiences and results for which academic departments and the Office of International Programs presently offer financial assistance during the summer.
Expanded J-Term programming facilitation would be a good idea, and we believe there is a substantial desire in the student body for it. Dean Hammonds’ message to the student body mentioned that, “Of the students who remained in residence during the Winter Break 2010 period, only 26 percent of respondents said they would like to have had some ‘fun,’ ‘creative’ programming available.” However, this statistic is misleading in isolation. The only people allowed to stay on campus this past J-Term were already involved with a consuming activity, such as practicing a sport or writing a thesis. It seems fairly obvious that these thus-committed students did not need conceive of a need for additional programming. However, it does not follow that students who were off-campus this past Winter Break would not have appreciated additional programming, given the opportunity. In fact, this sub-group is the one which would most benefit from the College facilitating the J-Term experience to a greater extent, not thesis writers and winter athletes.
In order to better understand the sentiments of our peers, all responses from the survey students took on their January experience should be made available. This will not only be informative, but it will also help students leading next year’s programming better understand their constituencies.
All this said, we are appreciative of whatever programming will be available, and we are glad that the College has informed us of the details about the upcoming J-Term at a relatively early point this year. Next year’s J-Term does promise to provide an experience of some substance for many students. However, given the potential of this time period, we are sure that the College can do better. J-Term was not conceived of as J-Week, and it should not continue to be treated in such a manner.

Public service announcement: Put down the bottle and pick up the bong. Well, not really, but there is growing support that the alternative to unsafe drinking habits is a small, green plant.
Marijuana might be illegal, and it might be an illicit psychoactive drug, but its presence may be less harmful to the individuals in a community, especially college campuses, than alcohol. Although nobody can argue that widespread drug use is a good thing for any college, it is an underlying truth that college students love to party, and many will choose to do so under the influence of some sort consciousness-altering chemical.
In honor of the start of Alcohol Awareness Month, students from over 80 colleges across 34 different states rallied at their schools for more lenient policies on marijuana last week. Why? Harsher penalties for weed lead students to drink, and they wanted that to change. It is the belief of the group Safer Alternative for Enjoyable Recreation, who coordinated the rallies on Apr. 1, that universities with harsh penalties for marijuana use are actively causing students to drink, and potentially over-consume, alcohol.
Despite having a more permissible legal status than marijuana, consuming alcohol has very real and very dangerous effects on college campuses. Each year, an average of 696,000 students are assaulted by another student who has been drinking, 1,700 students are killed annually in alcohol related deaths, and 97,000 instances of sexual abuse are alcohol-related. Additionally, rape is more prevalent on campuses where binge drinking is common practice, as 72 percent of rape victims reported being too drunk to give consent or resist. Obviously, when not consumed in moderation, alcohol can be very dangerous.
Therefore, in the abstract, it appears that marijuana is an overall safer drug. There have been no recorded deaths from cannabis overdose, and the potentially lethal dose of marijuana is over a thousand times the effective dose. There is also no link between lung cancer and chronic marijuana use, according to a study done at UCLA in 2006, yet unhealthy alcohol consumption is known to have very detrimental effects on the liver.
Let us assume that students will choose to party with a type of drug and are indifferent to which one. Which one they choose is dependent on a variety of reasons, but certainly the penalties of consuming are one of them. Many more schools have stricter punishments for possessing marijuana, and thus students have this in mind when they gravitate toward the more available, and potentially more dangerous, alcohol. Although schools should certainly not encourage the consumption of drugs, they might consider recognizing that marijuana can be safer alternative to binge drinking and adjusting their penalties accordingly. At the very least, school-administered punishments for misuse of alcohol and possessing marijuana should be equal, allowing students to make a rational choice.
There are certainly other factors why one would choose to drink rather than smoke. One might be the fact that weed is illegal. However, many students might cite this as a deterrent and still partake in the just-as-illegal act of underage drinking. Additionally, it is true that weed is not a perfect practical substitute for drinking, as drinking is a more “party friendly” than marijuana. Yet another factor might be that the purchase of marijuana could bring about negative externalities to a community, such as drug dealers, gangs, and violence.
It seems that at this point in time, no college or university is ready to embrace weed as an alternative to drinking, and there are good reasons for this position. And of course, abstaining from harmful practices such as drinking and smoking is easily the best choice; however, college students will continue to drink. So, on a personal level, in the spirit of Alcohol Awareness Month, students across the nation should reflect on the substances that they put in their bodies, and contemplate whether or not their current lifestyle is one that they feel best maximizes their individual well-being.

Many commentators, analysts, and political junkies love following the gamesmanship and strategy of elections. The process to decide our elected officials is, after all, full of exciting ploys and clever tactics.  But the games surrounding the process have too often succeeded in making the entire electoral and policymaking process an empty charade in which tricks and strategies are more important than voter choice. To renew our democracy, the methods in which our elections are held must be changed to more properly reflect voters’ preferences.
For centuries, our elections have suffered from a flawed, plurality voting system. Our system produces outcomes in which the winning candidate often does not represent the policy preferences of the majority of voters. In the presidential election of 1844, when slave-owner James Polk defeated widely-respected abolitionist Henry Clay, Polk’s fellow abolitionist James Birney accounted for the narrow difference in many states that Clay lost, and probably cost abolitionists the presidency decades before the Civil War. In 1912, William Howard Taft, Theodore Roosevelt, and Eugene Debs created a jumbled electoral confusion and allowed Woodrow Wilson to waltz to the presidency despite the fact that Taft and Roosevelt combined had won far more votes for a more conservative agenda.
In the modern era, the 2000 election was the most notable example of a case in which voters’ preferences were not properly represented. Through our plurality voting system, a right-of-center candidate took office despite the fact that a clear majority of the public voted for liberal policies in the form of former Vice President Al Gore ’69 and consumer rights activist Ralph Nader. By 2004, Republicans were funding Nader’s campaign for office, and the gaming of the system reached new levels in congressional elections, with major candidates strategically funding fringe opponents in the hope of siphoning votes from their opponents. Elections that should focus on policy preferences instead have come to depend on the ability to manipulate a deeply flawed system.
When confronted with this reality, political analysts and commentators often exclaim helplessness at the outcome, citing Kenneth Arrow’s “impossibility theorem” as a justification for using a flawed voting system. Arrow, a Stanford economist, won the Nobel Prize in Economics for his theorem explaining that no voting system could perfectly represent the preferences of a group of voters. According to the theorem, a perfectly representative voting system would create an outcome where the ranking of winners would align with voter preferences, unanimity would be respected, there would be no dictators, and irrelevant choices would not affect the final result.
As William Poundstone observes in his book “Gaming the Vote,” it is important to realize that the existence of the impossibility theorem certainly does not rule out the prospect of improving our electoral system. Rather, the theorem sets an important foundation for a discussion of the efficiency and representative nature of voting systems, and should encourage the discussion of electoral improvements in local, state, and federal governments.
There are a variety of voting systems that should be examined as alternatives to our currently flawed system, but there is a specific one, instant-runoff voting, that holds the most potential for the future. Already endorsed by President Obama and Arizona Senator John McCain, instant-runoff, used by Australia and Canada, allows voters to rank candidates preferentially. When all the votes are received, if no candidate receives over 50 percent of the first-rank preferences, the candidate with the fewest number of first-preference votes is eliminated and the ballots that ranked the eliminated candidate first transfer their first-preference vote to their second-ranked candidate. This process goes on until one candidate wins over 50 percent of the first-preference vote. The system represents voter preferences more accurately than our current framework, because it allows voters for third-party candidates to signal accurately their policy preferences in the event that their candidate is not victorious.
The system is by no means mathematically perfect, and, like any other system, it can still be manipulated. The system does, however, provide solutions to a variety of problems with our current electoral system. It could prevent low turnout primaries from determining the general election slate of candidates while also not allowing every candidate who files for election a place on the ballot for November elections. If America had instant-runoff, a majority of abolitionists might have elected an abolitionist president in 1844, and a majority of liberals might have elected a liberal president in 2000. The winning candidate of every election could proclaim the support of a majority of the electorate, and elections would be about policy preferences instead of gamesmanship. A strong democracy requires a strong electoral foundation, and decades of history and analysis of voting systems prove that we must change our voting system to preserve the legitimacy of our democracy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before I came to Harvard, a Rabbi from the Israeli Yeshiva where I spent my gap year cautioned me about the spiritual dangers of attending a non-Jewish university. He wasn’t going to discourage my attending a “secular college” like Harvard, he said, but he was going to warn me about the corrosive effect that the frivolity towards sexuality on campus would have on my religious devotion if I let myself interact extensively with that culture.
Basically, he meant that Harvard can be a hazardous place for religious Jews like me because of people like Lena Chen ’09-’10, the former sex blogger extraordinaire with whom I met this past Friday.
The goal of our meeting was simple. Driven by my own curiosity, I was determined to find out if, despite our wildly different backgrounds and religiosities, Chen and I could find overlap—any overlap—on our personal sexual philosophies. Fortunately, despite my initial trepidation, our meeting did not fall short.
Chen, of course, is best known for her blog Sex and the Ivy, in which she chronicled every excruciating detail of her explosive sexual life at Harvard during her sophomore and junior years. Indeed, while I was experiencing a religious awakening in Israel, Chen was experiencing a sexual awakening, and from its inception in August 2006 her incendiary and provocative blog spellbound the campus.
Eventually, however, she stopped writing entirely about her personal sexual exploits after a few months of dating her current beau. “I was like, okay, so I’m never writing about my sex life again,” she said. “Ever. As long as I’m in this relationship. And I’m still in this relationship.”
Her sudden interest in monogamy was an area in which I originally thought we would be able to find common ground. My own personal sexual philosophy is probably best expressed by Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik in his essay “The Redemption of Sexual Life.” The sex drive, he says, represents the “eternal quest of the unique, lonely individual to flee his solitude,” and the extraordinary longing for a deep “metaphysical union” with another. Indeed, it is no coincidence that the Biblical Hebrew word for copulation is the same as the word for “to know.”
Although Chen told me that she believes in neither marriage nor religion, I thought that perhaps on some basic level, Chen’s long-term sexual commitment to a single person reflected an idealistic overlap between us. Perhaps, I thought, her decision to settle down reflected an epiphany about the meaning acquired by sexuality in a monogamous relationship.
I was wrong.
“People place so much emphasis on romantic love,” Chen explained. Although her boyfriend is “one of the most important people in [her] life,” within the confines of even a committed relationship, she told me, such an intimate love would probably be detrimental to her own well-being. “I don’t think the emotional bond to my boyfriend should be different than the emotional bonds to other people in my life,” she said, “and it would probably be unhealthy [if it were].” Indeed, “if you’re actually looking at the quality of that one [romantic] relationship compared to all other relationships in your life, there’s no reason why that one relationship should supersede all others.”
To make sure I understood her position correctly, I asked her, point blank, if she truly made no distinction for herself between having sex, either with her boyfriend or some random stranger, and going out to eat at a nice restaurant. Her answer? Other than the fact that it feels more pleasurable to sleep with someone you’re committed to, “no, probably not.” In fact, she claimed, the only reason that she practices sexual monogamy within her romantic relationships in the first place is that “there are some social constructs that are really hard to overcome.” Because she places no inherent meaning in the sexual act itself beyond pleasure, I discovered, we are on entirely opposite ends of a spectrum.
So why was the meeting not a total failure? Because halfway through the interview, I suddenly realized that neither of us was attempting to convince the other that our position was superior.
“The goal of sexual liberation,” Chen told me, “should not have been to create new sexual standards that people had to adhere to, but rather to create a society where you didn’t feel pressure to have sex, or to not have sex, or to do anything really.” Her ultimate goal is not to convince everyone to behave as she did before meeting her boyfriend but rather to create an environment where people are not proselytized for behaving sexually in a way “that they are comfortable with.”
Indeed, despite my and Chen’s disparate beliefs about pretty much everything about our own sexuality, we are both able to acknowledge our limits. I find a quiescent beauty in my philosophy and Chen finds happiness and fulfillment in hers. Both of us are still able to contribute to the marketplace of ideas at Harvard without attempting to run each other out of business. Regardless of your own religiosity, that fact alone ought to fill you with a sense of awe.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As many as 5.5 million Americans lack access to adequate treatment for severe migraines, Harvard Medical School researchers say.
The findings, published yesterday in the journal Neurology, indicate that uninsured patients were nearly twice as likely as the privately insured to receive substandard treatment for migraines.
Medicaid enrollees were 50 percent more likely to get substandard care, and the researchers suggest that access to some forms of insurance does not necessarily translate into adequate care.
The researchers analyzed 6,814 visits for migraines between 1997 and 2007—a nationally representative sample of the 68.6 million visits to doctors’ offices, hospital clinics, and emergency rooms.
Roughly 12 percent of Americans suffer from migraines, and about 45.7 million are currently uninsured, leaving a substantial portion of the country vulnerable to substandard migraine treatment.
Although Congress last month passed healthcare reform legislation intended to extend coverage to more Americans, a substantial population will remain vulnerable, according to Medical School neurology professor Rachel Nardin, who is senior author of the study. “Unfortunately, the new health law doesn’t fully address this problem.”
University Health Services director David S. Rosenthal ’59 noted that Massachusetts law requires that students living in the state hold health insurance policies, meaning that all students currently at the College can expect to have access to adequate care.

The average Harvard faculty member’s salary increased by 0.4 percent this academic year—well below the average increase of 1.2 percent in college and university salaries across the nation, the lowest in the 50-year history of the report released by the American Association of University Professors earlier this week.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences—Harvard University’s largest school—saw no change in salaries as a result of the Sept. 2008 decision to freeze all faculty and staff salaries, which comprised the largest portion of the school’s budget.
At the time, FAS faced a $220 million deficit after the University lost nearly 30 percent of its endowment within a period of four months.
In December of this academic year, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said faculty and staff salaries will increase by two percent in the fiscal year ending 2011.
“I hope this decision provides some reassurance after a very difficult year,” Smith wrote in a letter announcing the end of the freeze.
In the fiscal year ending 2009, Harvard saw a much larger jump in salaries, increasing 4.7 percent from an average of $142,700 to an average of $149,400.
This year’s average salary of $150,000 represents a range from an average of $104,400 for assistant professors to $191,200 for tenured professors.
Despite this year’s smaller increase, Harvard continues to have the highest average salary of universities nationwide, and Harvard’s peer institutions also reported small salary changes.
Yale, which in February announced a two percent cap on faculty and staff salary increases, saw a 0.84 percent decrease to an average salary of $129,400.
Surpassing the national mean, the average Princeton faculty member saw a two percent salary increase to $140,300.
FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal said FAS will “continue working to make Harvard a competitive employer.”

Harvard’s construction workers began removing the temporary scaffolding around the Allston Science Complex construction site yesterday, marking the first phase of the University’s plan to beautify the perimeter of the area following the indefinite construction halt announced in December.
The new landscape design is intended to address community concerns regarding the unattractiveness of the construction site, which Allston residents believe could remain barren for at least a decade.
University officials confirmed yesterday that tearing down the scaffolding is a preliminary step in its plans for a larger design.
“We’re starting to remove the sidewalk shelter as presented in the construction mitigation meeting last week,” University spokeswoman Lauren Marshall said in an e-mailed statement. “It represents the beginning stages to the perimeter improvements that were presented.”
The plan, which was announced at the Harvard Construction Management Sub-Committee’s meeting last Wednesday, involves replacing the current scaffolding around the perimeter of the construction site with a more permanent wooden fence.
The wooden fence will vary in height, ranging from six to twelve feet “to create some visual interest,” according to James Royce, a Stephen Stimson Associates landscape architect Harvard hired for the project.
In addition to removing the fence, Harvard will beautify the site by planting native perennial shrubs such as winterberry and red twig dogwood, as well as trees including river birches and red maples.
Harvard also plans to create more parking space to accommodate future tenants that the University hopes to bring to its vacant properties in Allston, addressing a concern residents have had about the availability of parking.

Everett City Councillor Sal N. DiDomenico claimed victory last night in the Democratic primary for a state Senate seat, defeating five contenders, three of whom hail from Cambridge.
DiDomenico won the race by just 135 votes, according to the Boston Globe, narrowly defeating Cambridge lawyer Timothy R. Flaherty.
DiDomenico would replace state Sen. Anthony D. Galluccio, who resigned in January after he was sentenced to a one-year jail term for failing a series of breathalyzer tests, a violation of his probation for a hit-and-run accident which injured two.
Flaherty requested a recount, stating on his Web site that “this race is simply too close to call” and that “throughout the day, we’ve seen evidence of voting irregularities in Everett.”
Cambridge’s candidates Flaherty, E. Denise Simmons, and Dennis A. Benzan garnered 46, 31, and 13 percent of the city’s votes, respectively. DiDomenico won 6 percent of Cambridge ballots—173 votes—and Michael J. Albano earned the remaining 3 percent. Less than 1 percent of the 2,921 votes cast by Cambridge Democrats went to the final candidate, Charlestown lawyer Daniel C. Hill.
DiDomenico has served as an Everett City Councillor since 2004 and has acted as Galluccio’s chief of staff.
DiDomenico said that his work in Galluccio’s office has given him a unique familiarity with the issues involved in the district, which spans all or part of Cambridge, Chelsea, Everett, Revere, Saugus, Somerville, and the Allston-Brighton and Charlestown sections of Boston.
“I know the issues in every city and town; I’ve been working on them for two-and-a-half years,” he told The Crimson last week.
On his Web site, DiDomenico listed plans targeted at each town in the district. For Cambridge, his stated goals include the creation of jobs in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, the preservation of the Cambridge Health Alliance, clean energy initiatives, and affordable housing.
Though he now resides in Everett, DiDomenico touted his Cantabrigian roots during the campaign. He was born in Cambridge and attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, and his family has owned a flower shop in Cambridge for more than forty years.
There were no Republican candidates in the race, so yesterday’s Democratic primary was the main event of the special election. In the general contest on May 11, DiDomenico will face Independent candidate John Cesan, a resident of Agawam.

One female Harvard Business School professor remembers the year 2007 as the “mass exodus.”
That year, nine of the 28 female junior faculty members at the time packed up and left. Three had come out of the tenure review process disappointed. The rest, facing what they felt to be slim chances, either chose not to apply for promotion or took leaves of absence to close out their time at Harvard.
None of the nine women—all but one of whom asked to remain anonymous to protect their relationship with the Business School—could quite pinpoint what had gone wrong or what hadn’t felt right.
But in interviews with The Crimson, all nine—along with several current faculty members—allude to a subtle, unconscious bias against women woven into the longstanding culture at the Business School.
With women making up only 29 percent of its junior faculty, the Business School faces one of the largest gender imbalances at Harvard’s graduate schools, according to the 2009 annual report issued by the Office of the Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity. At the other end of the spectrum, almost 60 percent of junior faculty at the Harvard Graduate School of Education are women.
Though the Business School has taken steps in recent years to create a friendlier environment for women, several current female faculty members argue that some aspects of the school’s culture are reminiscent of the male-dominated business world of previous generations. The lingering remnants of the old boys’ club, they say, place women at a noticeable disadvantage.
“There is a subtle difference in treatment that men and women receive,” one of the nine former faculty members recalls. “These small differences in treatment accumulate. It damages women over time.”
“That particular instance of decimation [when eight of her colleagues left the school along with her in 2007] could be rationalized by the administration case-by-case for all very different reasons,” she adds. “But in reality, many of the men that had similar characteristics did make it.”
UNCONSCIOUS GENDER BIAS
Soon after taking the helm of the Business School in 2005, Dean Jay O. Light sought to improve the environment for women on campus. Under his watch, women who gave birth were granted an additional year in the typical 10-year “tenure clock” as well as an extended maternity leave starting in 2006.
But several current female faculty members say the deep-seated cultural bias remains, coloring their experiences at the school.
“[Dean Light] was very instrumental in getting these issues talked about and out in the open,” says one female faculty member, who wished to remain anonymous to protect her relationship with the school. “I felt like he was trying.”
“But then not a whole lot happened,” she says.
Though the nine women who left in 2007 stop short of alleging gender discrimination, they cite various instances in which they felt subject to pressures that their male colleagues escaped—inappropriate remarks directed at female faculty or a constant pressure to spend less time with their children, for example.
“I was once advised to get a nanny so I could do more work,” one of the nine who chose to leave the Business School says. “A woman can fit the mold and pretend to be one of the men and sacrifice family life—but if they want to do both, it’s harder.”
Another professor recalls an end of the semester evaluation in which students commented on a female colleague’s fashion choices as opposed to her teaching.
“It seems empirically that women have a harder time being respected and getting that credibility in the classroom needed to be a good teacher,” adds another female professor, who wished to remain anonymous.
Satisfaction ratings from female faculty at the Business School fell well below the average at all of Harvard’s other graduate schools, according to a faculty survey administered in 2007, and the Business School reported the second largest difference in satisfaction ratings between male and female faculty.
But faculty members note that the gender skew is not a problem specific to Harvard Business School, as peer institutions such as Stanford, Wharton, and Kellogg report even lower percentages of women on faculty.
“Is the Business School a horrible place? No,” says Business School professor Regina E. Herzlinger, who was the first woman to receive an endowed chair at the school in the 1980s. “Academia needs to look at women and be cognizant that there are unconscious and conscious biases.”
LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL
As Light enters the final months of his deanship, the Business School continues its efforts both to attract and to support female faculty, such as routinely placing ads in publications like “Women in Higher Education,” which is geared towards female academics.
Going forward, the Business School aims to increase the representation of female junior faculty hires to 40 percent, according to David Bell, who is the senior associate dean and director of faculty planning and recruiting.
Bell attributes the gender gap at the school in part to the limited pool of female talent, explaining that “because there is pressure across all institutions to hire women, they’re in great demand.”
For female students at the Business School, Bell adds, the low proportion of women on the faculty may negatively affect academic performance, though he says it is unclear whether female senior faculty are better mentors than males to female junior faculty and students.
“If that’s true, obviously the fact that we have a high proportion of male tenured faculty for historical reasons might lead women to have a harder time being successful,” Bell says.
To combat gender-related insensitivity, Light encouraged Business School faculty to attend a seminar on unconscious bias given by psychology professor Mahzarin R. Banaji of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences this spring, and the school’s annual Christensen Center Colloquium—which helps faculty learn how to teach the case method—will highlight gender issues this fall.
“This is something we definitely talk about in our faculty meetings,” business administration professor Andrei Hagiu says. “But I don’t think there’s discrimination here.”
And business administration professor Robin Ely, who also teaches in the Business School’s Women’s Leadership Forum, says that there is no single explanation for the dearth of female faculty members.
“There are small inadvertent things that go on in our culture, but there is no blatant sexism here,” Ely says.
Bell adds that the administration is uncertain how to tackle what is perceived as an “unconscious bias.”
“If we knew a way to detect the problem and we could solve it, we would,” Bell says.
Entrepreneurial management professor Lynda M. Applegate notes that she has seen an improvement in the environment for women at the Business School during her 24 years at the school, adding that the pressures of tenure review have increased for both male and female junior faculty.
Each of the nine women who left Harvard Business School went on to join the faculty at other business schools or enter the private sector. Several are now tenured or up for tenure.
“You’d think that the Business School would have better success in attracting and keeping women,” one of the women says. “The administration is not malicious—they just haven’t figured out how to do that yet.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Forty Winks, a new lingerie boutique on 56 JFK St. above Shay’s Pub and Wine Bar, opened its doors last Friday, hoping to meet Harvard Square’s demand for lingerie.
The store’s owners, Rachel A. Wentworth and Meredith W. Donaldson—both former employees at Harvard Square’s Mint Julep—said Forty Winks differs from other lingerie outlets such as Victoria’s Secret in that its image is not about sex.
“We have sexy stuff, but we didn’t want that to be the main thrust of the store,” Wentworth said. “We want our customers to feel that whatever they want is sexy.”
With a decor characterized by feminine colors and floral patterns, the boutique carries about 30 different lines, including a line of colorful, “eco-friendly” thongs made from recycled silk.
The store also sells lougewear, shapewear, sweaters, and accessories.
Wentworth added that Forty Winks handpicked products whose company backgrounds would appeal to customers.
“We went for products that had stories behind them, that were started by single moms or made in cooperatives in India,” Wentworth said.
The two women left Mint Julep in February to focus on opening their new store, which they had been discussing for about a year.
“We found that we were spending all our time at work together,” Donaldson said. “We figured we might as well spend all our time together and open a store too.”
In choosing the store’s name, Wentworth said they wanted to evoke “somewhere warm where you could relax away from home—to feel you were rested and not stressed.”
“We started googling “catnaps” and things like that,” Wentworth said. “And we thought [Forty Winks] was the cutest name.”
When a F. Scott Fitzgerald’s short article “Gretchen’s Forty Winks” came up on the search engine, the two settled on the name.
Customers browsing the store since its opening left with positive impressions, though one felt the prices were steep. The prices of bras, for example, range from $34 to $86.
“I really like the product, but it’s a little out of my price range now as I’ve just moved from out-of-state,” said Yvette M. Tazernier, 27, who works in Allston. “But I really like the quality of the products and that they’re comfortable, sexy, and functional.”
Wentworth and Donaldson plan to start selling Forty Winks products online within the next six weeks.
Customers can also follow Forty Winks on Facebook or Twitter for store events, sales, and possibly discounts for Harvard alumni during Commencement weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yundan Pi admits that she was not prepared for her duties as a teaching fellow.
Pi, a third-year graduate student in the Earth and Planetary Sciences Department, served as a teaching fellow for an advanced course in her department last spring, but she says she did not feel completely comfortable communicating with her students.
“Sometimes, I just didn’t do well,” Pi says, adding that she often had trouble responding to her students’ questions. “I was so nervous.”
Pi, who has lived in America for seven years, has had to acclimate herself to the American classroom after experiencing a very different pedagogical environment in China. She had not been prepared to see students eat in the classroom, and she was unfamiliar with the concept of extracurricular commitments.
So when the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning extended a pilot pedagogy course this spring targeted at graduate students who are non-native English speakers, Pi says she pounced on the “wonderful opportunity.”
Since 2007, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences has expanded its collaboration with the Bok Center—which focuses on undergraduate teaching—on a series of initiatives that seek to combat the language barrier between TFs and students in the classroom.
Last fall, the Bok Center began a pilot program called “Oral Communications Skills Course For International TFs.” The students—who hail predominantly from East Asia and study the physical sciences—are joined by two undergraduates in a unique environment that exposes the graduate students to American culture and the Harvard classroom.
THE LANGUAGE BARRIER
William N. Forster ’13, one of the undergraduates who assist the non-native speakers in the new course, recalls his foreign Life Science 1a teaching fellow’s struggle with communicating the basic concepts of biology.
“It made it not worth going to class,” Forster says.
Nearly one third of all students at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences are foreign. Each year, there are around 230 incoming international students, and not all of them can speak perfect English. But most of them are requested to lead a section for an undergraduate course by their second or third year in school, according to GSAS Dean for Student Affairs Garth O. McCavana.
The Bok Center has offered pedagogy courses for graduate student instructors since its establishment in 1975. Departments that offer similar courses for their own graduate students will often collaborate with the center, says Bok Center Associate Director Virginia Maurer.
But until 2007, there existed no standard method of screening the language skills of foreign TFs. Departments used their own methods of preparing section leaders, ranging from courses that count for credit to a simple day-long workshop at the Bok Center, according to Assistant Dean of the College Logan S. McCarty.
“Graduate students would be asked to teach who may not have had the language skills needed to be successful in the classroom,” McCarty says. “And that doesn’t benefit anyone.”
In 2007, a GSAS committee’s recommendations ordered that all non-native English speaking graduate students be screened for competency in reading and speaking English—whether they anticipated teaching undergraduates or not.
McCarty—who has worked in the Office of Undergraduate Education since 2007—says he has noticed a decrease in undergraduate complaints about their TFs’ language skills, and a rise in CUE guide scores for foreign TFs.
But the improvement in evaluations have coincided with an array of workshops and classes offered by the Bok Center—including this year’s pilot program.
“The Bok Center’s focus on understanding the American classroom is crucial,” McCarty says about continued support for TFs’ interactions with undergraduates.
TEACHING THE TEACHERS
The Bok Center has recently reemphasized its focus on acclimating the foreign TF through the new semester-long course that utilizes undergraduate perspectives to help graduate students better understand the Harvard classroom.
The success of the eight-person class in the fall semester compelled the Bok Center to offer a second section in the spring. The Center accepted 16 of the 40 graduate students who applied for a spot in the class.
“There’s a need and a desire for this kind of thing,” says Maurer, who hopes the program will continue next semester.
To foster better communication with undergraduates, graduate students meet weekly with the College students working in the course for informal discussion.
In the classroom, eight GSAS students sit with two undergraduates and discuss cultural issues and current events, says course head Pamela Pollock, who is working on a dissertation about foreign students’ experiences in the American graduate school system.
“It’s really hard to build small talk if you don’t have the cultural base to know what’s going on,” Pollock says.
Last week, for example, students were asked to read an article about the intensity of the American college process. The exercise provided students the basic tools to engage in conversation both inside and outside the classroom, according to Pollock.
The course is not designed as a structural language course—such as an ESL class—but rather seeks to help graduate students practice “oral communication” across cultural barriers, Maurer says.
At Harvard, foreign TFs face pedagogical and cultural differences that do not always stem from insufficient language skills, Maurer says.
She describes one teaching fellow for Social Analysis 10—the popular introductory economics course commonly known as Ec 10—who received subpar CUE guide scores and complaints about his language skills from students in his section.
When Maurer began working with the individual, she reviewed a film of one of his classes and found that language was not the problem—the TF was teaching at a level too high for the students, she says.
“[The students] pegged it as being his language because he had an accent,” Maurer says.
BRIDGING CULTURAL DIFFERENCES
By seeking to improve the teaching skills of foreign TFs, the Bok Center course benefits both the graduate students—many of whom may later assume teaching posts—and their undergraduate students, Pollock says.
“That’s what I love about my job,” she says. “It’s a win-win for everyone.”
With the Bok Center course, Pi receives the undergraduate input she says is important for her to understand what College students expect in the classroom.
Forster—whose experience in Life Sci 1a provided some of the incentive to help out in the new course—meets weekly with each of his four graduate student partners to go over class work and engage them in general conversation.
He says that he has learned to identify the standard weak spots: vocabulary is not crucial, and he opts to focus on word stress and sentence fluency.
And like any rigorous teacher, Forster complains that his graduate students don’t practice enough outside of class.
“Every week, for some of them, is like starting new,” he says.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 14, 2010
An earlier version of the Apr. 14 news article "Graduate Student Teaching Fellows Lost in Translation" incorrectly suggested that there is a total of 230 international students in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. In fact, the 230 figure refers to the approximate number of incoming international students each year.

Harvard Medical School researchers say that alcohol consumption may be influenced by drinking habits of family and friends.
Using data collected from the ongoing Framinghma Heart Study, Harvard Medical School professor and Pforzheimer House Master Nicholas A. Christakis and his colleagues were able to trace drinking patterns within social networks.
“We all intuitively have the sense that we as individuals are connected in ways that oftentimes we may not even understand,” said James N. Rosenquist, a health care policy research fellow at the Medical School and lead author of the study. “An individual’s behavior may affect others and vice versa.”
The study, published last week in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, found that after 32 years, an individual was 50 percent more likely to drink heavily—defined as more than one drink per day for women or more than two drinks for men—if friends or relatives also drank heavily.
The researchers founds that non-drinkers had a smaller influence on their social network, and an individual was 29 percent more likely to abstain if a friend or relative did not drink.
Drinking habits among co-workers and neighbors were not significantly correlated with how much an individual drank.
When asked whether the study’s findings would spur changes in alcohol consumption regulation on Harvard campus, Allison C. Hyland ’12, a Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors subcommittee member, said she believes DAPA may host more alcohol-free events, such as the “Learn to Dance Sober” event earlier this year.
According to Hyland, DAPA statistics show that the average Harvard student drinks responsibly.
Some Harvard students also disagreed with the study’s findings that heavy drinkers have a much greater influence within their social networks than non-drinkers.
One student, who chose to remain anonymous because he was under the legal drinking age, said that he believed his social network moderates how much he drinks rather than encourages him to drink more, saying that he began to drink more consciously after coming to Harvard.
“There is a stigma,” he said, “You don’t want to be the one throwing up at the party.”
The student also cited a family history of heavy drinking as another factor affecting his decision to drink more moderately,
Another student, who also chose to remain anonymous because he was not of legal drinking age, echoed similar sentiments, stating that he experienced more negative reactions to drinking at Harvard than when he went to visit a friend attending a state school.

The Cambridge Public School Committee met with a group of mathematics experts last night for a roundtable discussion on the latest trends in teaching mathematics in public schools.
The meeting—the first this year featuring outside experts—included presentations from math education professionals followed by a discussion among Committee members.
Patricia M. Nolan ’80 raised concerns parents have raised about the math curricula at the schools.
“District results that show the need of greater performance in mathematics,” Nolan added.
According to the 2008 Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System test results, about half of Cambridge Public School students fall into the below-average categories of “Needs Improvement” or “Warning/Failing.”
The committee members also discussed the difficulty of meeting the varying needs of all students, including advanced students.
“Certain students are going to take more [from the curriculum] than others,” said Suzanne Chapin, who teaches at Boston University’s School of Education.
Several others echoed this sentiment, arguing that divisions within a classroom would address the large discrepancies in academic level among students.
Mary Eich, the K-8 mathematics coordinator at the Newton Public Schools, said that the “most difficult issue” facing math education at public schools is how to create such divisions.
“Kids know what group they are in—even if it is the blue birds or the black birds,” Eich said, referring to the different code names teachers sometimes use to differentiate academic levels. “The way I see it is that I want to put off the moment [of telling students] ‘you’re not good enough’ for as long as possible.”
Committee members also discussed the need for more creativity in teaching math to children. Nat Stahl—representing the nonprofit math education organization, The Math Project—emphasized the need for math “to be a discussion of ideas rather than development of skills.”
“Teachers have to be ready to take these questions, test it out rather than just say yes or no and move on because you have better fish to fry,” he added.

Consider it a road trip well spent for men’s basketball co-captain Jeremy Lin, who traveled last Wednesday to Portsmouth, Va. to take part in the Portsmouth Invitational, a four-day tournament that allows college seniors the opportunity to improve their professional prospects in front of scouts from around the world.
Playing point guard for the Tidewater Sealants, Lin averaged 10 points and six assists over three games—fourth-best out of the 64 players in attendance. The two-time first-team All-Ivy star was also third in steals to go along with an average of 1.7 rebounds per game.
Lin’s solid showing amidst the likes of Cal’s Jerome Randle and Alabama’s Mikhail Torrance earned him plenty of praise from professional evaluators.
“He’s a guy that I think intrigued a lot of scouts,” said NBA Assistant Director of Scouting Ryan Blake. “He wasn’t the top scorer, wasn’t the top assists leader, but he did all the right things, and I think that’s a plus, especially when you get into an environment like that.”
“I talked to the players before the tournament and said this to all of them, ‘Listen, these teams know you can score, they want to know if you can play basketball’—and I think he proved that this week,” Blake added.
“I thought he got better as the camp went on…it showed that he was able to make adjustments, which speaks to his feel for the game, which is obviously off the charts,” said Jonathan Givony, president of DraftExpress.com. “Probably the best thing he showed is that he’s just an exceptionally smart player, he’s got great court vision, he’s incredibly unselfish…I thought he had a very strong showing there, and I’m sure he helped himself.”
“I think he was one of the better pure point guards out there—not the best,” said Ryan Feldman, the co-founder of The Hoops Report. Feldman awarded Lin a 3rd-team all-tournament spot. “He was more under control than any of the other point guards…he acted like what you want to see out of a point guard.”
“He was impressive in that he didn’t try to do too much to impress everybody,” Feldman said. “He just tried to play his game…and show that he’s a good pure point guard, if that’s what somebody wants.”
Though pleased with how he handled the transition from scorer to the role of point guard, Lin wasn’t entirely satisfied with his overall performance.
“I was happy with some of the things that I did, but I definitely think there are areas for improvement,” Lin said. “I feel okay about it, not great…NBA three-point shooting, ball-handling, and defense—those are probably the three specific things [to work on].”
Next up on the agenda will be hiring an agent.
“I’ve narrowed it down to my final list, and I hope to make a final decision within a week or two,” Lin said.
After that will come the determination of a training location and participation in private workouts before the NBA Draft, which will be held June 24.
“I think he’ll be even more comfortable when he starts going into individual workouts, and when he gets to that, he’ll be able to show other things,” Blake said. “And then of course [he’ll] get an opportunity [to play in] a summer league, where he’s going to be able to play against even stronger players and show teams whether or not he can play.”
Though he impressed many at Portsmouth with his passing skills and ability to finish around the basket, the 6’3’’ Lin remains a long shot for the NBA at this point.
“I really like him, I think he has an opportunity, but we also had a lot of strong point guards in this tournament,” Blake said. “Could we see him in the NBA? Yes, absolutely I could see him in the NBA at some point…Will he get drafted? I don’t know…We have so many players that it’s such a fine line between making it and not making it.”
“For guys like him and 50 other players, there’s just a million different variables, circumstances that need to fall his way in terms of being put in the right situation,”  Givony said. “A lot of it has to do with luck…He passed one hurdle, and there’s still a couple more to go. He’s definitely in the picture as far as the NBA is concerned, but he’s not a lock at this point.”
Feldman was less optimistic about Lin’s professional prospects.
“He’s not going to make the NBA, unfortunately,” Feldman said. “He’ll probably get a shot in the summer league with somebody if he wants to, and after that he’ll go to team workouts…and you never know down the road.”
“Right now, he’s probably going to go play somewhere in Europe or Asia,” Feldman said.

Given the rare opportunity to compete during the week, the Harvard sailing team sent a young contingent to sail in the waters of the Charles River at the MIT-hosted Midweek Tech Invitational #1 yesterday afternoon.
The group came away with ninth- and 11th-place finishes in the field of 12.
“We did not perform very well in terms of final team standings,” freshman crew Lauren Tiedemann said. “But we were able to take advantage of the opportunity to compete in a different type of boat than we normally do. The Tech dinghies made for really interesting and more relaxed sailing, at least for the crew.”
First year skipper Sam Millham teamed up with sophomore crew Caroline Lowe to finish ninth yesterday, as the pair finished in the top three twice out of the eight races on the day.
Rookie skipper Nick Waldo and Tiedemann brought home an 11th-place effort.
Due to the low-key nature of the event, both pairs did not compete in the final two races of the afternoon.
As a result, both Waldo and Tiedemann were automatically given last place finishes for the races they did not finish, hurting the duo’s overall standing.
A squad from Tufts nicknamed the “Jumbalaya” emerged victorious out of the field comprised of local teams from Northeastern, Wellesley, Tufts, MIT, and Harvard.
“There was decent wind out there, pretty stable for the Charles,” Tiedemann said, “so we were able to get some quality experience competing against teams from throughout the region.”

The Harvard softball team couldn’t have picked a better time to have its best inning of the season.
Locked in a 1-1 stalemate, the Crimson (15-16, 6-2 Ivy) scored a season-high seven runs in the top of the 10th inning and used the effort of three pitchers to turn what had been a classic defensive duel into an 8-1 rout of Providence College (12-19, 3-5 Big East).
After sophomore pitcher Julia Moore held the Friars hitless for the first two innings, Providence got on the board in the third frame when Jen Abrams knocked an RBI single with two on and two out.
Moore was able to force the next batter to groundout to end the inning, allowing only three singles and an earned run over her outing.
Harvard’s bats were all but silent in the early going. Yet, while the Crimson was able to get lead-off singles in the first, fourth, and fifth innings, it remained hitless throughout the rest of the first five innings.
Co-captain Margaux Black pitched spotlessly in the fourth and fifth innings, allowing only two singles and giving up no walks.
“The pitching staff combined for a great game today,” Black said. “We kept the Providence hitters off-balance by using three pitchers.  Julia [Moore] gave us a great start and Rachel [Brown] shut them down in the late innings, giving our hitters a chance to win the game. It was great teamwork all around.”
Harvard threatened in the sixth inning when senior Stephanie Krysiak reached on a fielder’s choice following a walk awarded to junior Ellen Macadam, putting runners on first and second with only one out.  After a double steal moved the runners to second and third, Macadam was thrown out at home when sophomore Whitney Shaw reached on a fielder’s choice.  Freshman Jess Ferri grounded out for the final out of the inning and the Crimson remained down by a run heading into final stretch.
Sophomore pitcher Rachel Brown took the mound in the sixth inning in relief of Black and got off to a shaky start.  Brown recorded the first out but followed with a single and a walk. The runners moved to second and third after the next batter was retired on a fielder’s choice.
The Friars failed on their bid for insurance runs when Brown forced Providence designated hitter Jessie Bryant to strike out swinging.
Harvard would finally equalize in the seventh inning when, down to its last out with runners on first and second, sophomore pinch hitter Mari Zumbro reached on an error by second baseman Justine Stratton. The costly mistake plated freshman Ashley Heritage to even the score at 1-1.
The Crimson had a chance to take the lead when Macadam reached on yet another error, loading the bases for Krysiak.
But the .277 hitter couldn’t come through, as Providence shortstop Jenna Garcia fielded the hit cleanly to send the game into extra innings.
The eighth and ninth innings proved to be more of the same defensive struggle, with each team notching only one single each over the two innings.  Whether Harvard was ready to go home or because it had finally figured out Friars’ pitcher Alicia Grosso, the Crimson finally let it loose in the top of the 10th.
After Macadam’s leadoff double, Krysiak sacrificed to the pitcher to advance Macadam to third. Shaw walked, and Ferri’s fielder’s choice caused Macadam to get thrown out at home.
Co-captain Melissa Schellberg—who is a Crimson sports editor—stepped up to the plate and hit an RBI single to finally break the tie and put Harvard ahead, 2-1.
Stratton’s second error on the day allowed senior Jess Pledger to reach and Ferri to score an unearned run to extend the lead to two.
After a single from senior Jennifer Francis, a double from junior Emily Henderson, and a single from Macadam, the Crimson finally took a comfortable 8-1 lead into the bottom of the 10th.
Brown then made quick work of the Friars in the 10th, striking out two and allowing no hits to complete five innings of two-hit relief for her 10th win of the season.
“Today was a great game, definitely the type of game that we play for,” Brown said. “Our coach challenged us to win the game when we were trailing, and we took advantage of Providence’s mistakes. We were confident we could win and we pulled it out in the end. It was a great team win.”

Coming off a Sunday doubleheader in which it was only able to muster five total runs, the Harvard baseball team was due for an offensive explosion.
The Crimson got what it was looking for yesterday afternoon, scoring in six innings to win a wild 13-12 victory over Northeastern at Friedman Diamond.
Sophomore infielder Jeff Reynolds was 5-of-5 with seven RBI to lead an offensive attack that was highlighted by a five-run fifth inning.
Junior Dillon O’Neill added two hits and three runs, classmate Sean O’Hara scored four times, and senior Dan Zailskas had three hits for Harvard. Seven players in all had at least one hit for the Crimson.
“It was pretty important to bounce back and get on the right track,” O’Neill said.
The Harvard offense got on the board in the first when freshman Greg Davey walked, advanced to third on a failed pickoff attempt and a throwing error, and scored on a sacrifice fly by O’Hara.
The Huskies responded by taking the lead in the bottom of the first, when sophomore Matt Miller doubled to center field and was tripled in by senior David Gustafon. Gustafon would later score on an RBI groundout.
But the Crimson tied things up in the top of the second on an RBI double by Zailskas, while freshman pitcher Matt Doyle held Northeastern scoreless in the bottom half of the inning.
Both teams added two runs in the third frame. Harvard staged a two-out rally capped by a Reynolds triple into the left-center gap that scored O’Hara and sophomore Marcus Way.
“Everybody was having really good at-bats today,” Reynolds said. “We were putting balls in play, and they were getting through.”
After the teams went scoreless through the fourth, the Crimson offense took off again in the top of the fifth inning. O’Neill started it up with a walk against Huskie reliever Kevin Ferguson, scoring one batter later when freshman Danny Moskovits tripled him in. After an O’Hara walk, Reynolds singled in Moskovits, and junior Tyler Albright then doubled to right center to score two. Albright advanced to third on a balk, then scored on junior Sam Franklin sacrifice fly to give Harvard a 9-4 lead.
“I think we have a lot of good hitters as a team; where we get in trouble on offense is when we swing at pitcher’s pitches instead of waiting for our pitch to hit,” O’Neill said. “I think the fifth inning is a good example of us being patient at the plate, not getting ourselves out, and waiting for the right pitch to hit.”
But the pesky Huskies fought back in the bottom of the fifth with a Ryan Maguire two-run double down the left field line, putting them back in the game at 9-6.  The runs continued to pile up in the sixth inning. With the bases loaded, Reynolds connected once again for a single that would drive in two more Crimson runs.
With the score 11-6, Northeastern scored four times in the bottom half of the inning to bring itself within one.
Neither team recorded a hit in the seventh, but O’Neill led off the eighth for Harvard with a single through the left side. After O’Hara was intentionally walked and Way struck out, Reynolds continued his clutch performance with a two-out, two-RBI single to right that scored O’Neill and O’Hara, and gave the Crimson a 13-10 lead heading into the bottom of the inning.
“I just put it where they weren’t, and you get lucky sometimes,” Reynolds said.
But the Huskies had a response of their own, picking up two runs in the bottom of the eighth. Freshman Logan Gillis doubled down the leftfield line off Way, scoring two and putting Northeastern down by only a run as the teams headed into the ninth. Harvard was unable to pick up an insurance run, stranding two on base. But sophomore Conner Hulse was able to hold off a Northeastern rally, stranding two baserunners and getting the save to conclude the wild affair. Way earned the win with 2.2 innings of relief.
Reynolds’ five hits brought his season average up to .396. He also had two steals and missed a cycle by just a home run.
The game saw 28 hits in total, each team with 14 apiece.
It was the second consecutive high-scoring game between the two teams. Last season, the Crimson topped the Huskies, 16-13, in the squad’s final game of the 2009 season.
“It’s always a wild one with those guys,” Reynolds said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When ESPN college basketball reporter Andy Katz came to Lavietes Pavilion in February to watch Harvard take on Cornell, he was serenaded with adoring chants, and he humored the crowd with a wave.
It was a strange moment of celebrity—the reporter’s role inverted from watching to being watched—that typifies Harvard’s place in the larger landscape of college sports. Here, it feels oddly validating when the mainstream media pays notice to Harvard athletics, as if the attention legitimizes the quality of play on campus.
Tonight, students will have a chance to interact with Katz once again, albeit in a more formal setting, when he shares his thoughts and stories at 7:30 p.m. in the Owen Room inside Winthrop G Entry.
The event, which is hosted by the Harvard Sports Analysis Collective provides an opportunity to learn from one of college basketball’s most recognizable voices. For over 10 years, Katz has been with ESPN, where he blogs, writes, and reports regularly on the biggest stories in college hoops.
Take the chance after dinner to pick Katz’s brain on Ivy basketball, NCAA tournament expansion, journalism, and other topics in Winthrop.

Harvard’s endowment might be down, but members of the Harvard faculty are still raking in cash—at least compared to their peers.
Harvard provides the highest average salary to professors (at $191,200), followed by Columbia University and University of Chicago, according to the New York Times. Yale took 6th place at $174,100.
A recent annual study by the American Association of University Professors found that the salaries of full-time faculty increased by about 1.2 percent this year, which is a smaller increase than it has been in 50 years.
It is important to note that the ranking of raw salary numbers does not take into account the cost of living in certain areas (and we know Cambridge isn’t exactly the cheapest locale), or early retirement plans that long-time professors (a.k.a the most highly paid) might have taken advantage of in the past year, bringing down the institutions’ average salaries.
But even though the faculty at Harvard may be making big bucks, President Faust’s pay does not come close to topping the list. Faust’s salary ranks 56 in a list of the highest paid college presidents released at the end of last semester.

In an e-mail sent out yesterday to the Class of 1975, the Harvard Alumni Association (HAA) apologized profusely for what some would consider at most a spelling error. Apparently, the recently printed Thirty-fifth Class Report omitted the "e" from "Radcliffe" on the book's spine.
According to the College Alumni Programs Web site, Class Reports "are a longstanding Harvard tradition, dating back at least to the mid-1800s. They serve as historical chronicles of classes and encourage alumni to reconnect with each other and the College through the sharing of current contact information, family news, and in-depth life stories."
Class Reports are sent to all alumni in a given class, and the Class Report Office's Web site indicates that 81 percent of the Class of 1975 contributed financially to this year's publication. So this is pretty awkward.
On the bright side, yesterday's e-mail, which was co-signed by HAA director of College Alumni Programs Courtney D. Shurtleff and HAA executive director John P. Reardon '60, extended alumni the options of trading their books in when they're in town for their 35-year reunion or requesting a prepaid mailer for returning the book. The organization explained that returned books will be "corrected by hand at [the HAA's] local bindery."
By hand? Impressive. Though no wonder they made the mistake—the bindery probably thought the terminal silent "e" was from an olde-tymey spelling—but it turns out that “Radcliffe” is actually  the more modern spelling of the college’s namesake, Anne Radcliffe, whose name was often spelled “Radclyffe.”
Props to the 1975 graduates of Harvarde Univerſity and Ye Olde Radclyffe Colleg on their upcoming 35th reunion, though.

If you're planning on submitting your 2010 U.S. Census form, here's a friendly reminder that you need to turn it into your House today.
According to two separate e-mails sent out by Kirkland House building manager Scott Haywood and Pforzheimer House administrator Suzanne Watts, the College will collect the Census forms from drop-off boxes around midday today (1 p.m. in Kirkland and noon in Pfoho).
"This is the first time in 20 years that I know of where the areas college student population has been encouraged to participate," Haywood wrote in the e-mail.
The Census Bureau also sent out an e-mail explaining the Census process, noting that students living on campus only needs to answer seven questions and that the information collected "affects the number of seats your state holds in the U.S. House of Representatives...help[s] distribute more than $400 billion in federal funds each year for services in your community like public transportation, campus safety, scholarship programs, and much more!"

The person next to you yawns, and all of a sudden you can’t help but open your mouth, close your eyes, and take a gaping breath of air. It’s involuntary and seemingly contagious.
Well yawning isn’t the only thing that’s contagious, apparently so is drinking. If you partied hard on Friday night, it is more likely that your close friends did too.
Nicholas A. Christakis, Harvard Medical School professor and Pforzheimer House Master, recently released these findings in a new study. Along with obesity, loneliness, death, happiness, and smoking, drinking is now being labeled as a pastime that can affect those around you.
By using a social network of over 12,000 people during a span of 32 years, Christakis was able to analyze the impact of this network on the clustering of drinkers and non-drinkers and the subsequent consumption of alcohol. He also examined the nature of social ties, noting that close friends and family had a larger impact on drinking than neighbors or colleagues.
Up until three degrees of separation, Christakis concluded that social networks can strongly impact the way in which we act and the life decisions that we make concerning alcohol consumption.
Next time you and your roommate wake up with raging hangovers, you’ll know that whoever took the first sip made the other 50% more likely to drink. Make sure to guilt that friend into bringing you breakfast in bed and some Advil. After all, drinking (like yawning) is contagious and therefore your current hangover was partly their fault. Right?

The infamous Adams  House gong—which went missing the week before Housing Day—has yet to be  returned, and Adams House authorities are getting serious about  recovering it.
Thieves have until 10 a.m. Thursday morning to return the  gong before a police report is filed and what is likely an interhouse  prank turns into a criminal offense, according to an e-mail sent by an Adams House HoCo co-chair.
A group  calling itself Friends United for Chinese  Knicknacks and Against Detention of Ancient Manchurian  Stuff took credit  for stealing the gong—which, in the past, had been sounded when non-Adams House residents attempted to eat in the  conveniently located dining hall.
The gong, a  symbol of controversial interhouse dining restrictions, was also stolen  in 1999 and 2004, but each time  surfaced shortly after its disappearance.
As Adams HoCo Co-Chair  Samantha L. Houston '11 explained in an e-mailed statement, "Adams House  likes a prank as much as anyone. However, given the duration of the  gong's absence without a clue regarding its location, this prank has  became theft. We will file a police report if the gong is not returned  to our House Administrator's office by Thursday morning at 10 a.m."

You’ve probably heard much about the accomplishments of Crimson athletes this year—from capturing Ivy League titles to making national headlines—but what about those non-varsity sports?
This past weekend, the Harvard Table Tennis Team sent three of its best players to the 2010 College Table Tennis National Championships in Waukesha, Wisconsin for the first time in four years.  Although the trip was not subsidized and the players had to pay out of pockets, they were still happy to attend the three-day tournament, which hosted over 250 table tennis players from more than 40 different colleges and universities.
Nancy Chen ’13, the only freshman and female on Harvard’s team, was one of these lucky players.  Chen competed in both the women’s singles and the mixed doubles events during the weekend. In mixed doubles, Chen played with teammate Norman Y. Yao from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and took down Nguyen/Lam of Georgia State, 11-9, 11-8, 11-5, before falling to Mizobuchi/Rocha of Lindenwood, 11-3, 11-8, 11-5.
In the women’s singles event, Chen finished second in the Round Robin First Round event, advancing to the second round of the tournament against the first seeded Sara Hazinski from Texas Wesleyan.  Although Chen lost, 11-2, 11-2, 11-2, looking back she describes the match as “interesting.” “[Hazinski] wasn’t doing anything incredibly complicated, she was just really consistent,” Chen said.
As for her future goals in table tennis, “I want to keep improving. We play in college a lot more than I played at home, but now that I have competitive teammates and a good environment to play in, I hope to continue doing well and just have fun playing the sport.”
Chen can be seen next playing in the spring freshman intramural ping-pong tournament, which is already under way.
