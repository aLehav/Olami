After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Award-winning Japanese ramen brand Menya Jiro celebrated the grand opening of its first Boston location in Harvard Square on July 14.
The new restaurant is located at 57 JFK St. within the Crimson Galeria, which is already home to Veggie Grill and The Maharaja, and is set to debut cannabis store Cookies in the near future.
While Menya Jiro first sought approval to expand into Harvard Square in late 2019, the Covid-19 pandemic delayed the grand opening of its newest location for a year, Andy Truong — owner of the Menya Jiro location in the Square — said in an interview.
The brand originated in 2010 in Ibusuki, a city located in Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan.
The restaurant quickly gained popularity for its customizable ramen bowls, which allow customers to select from a variety of protein and vegetable options.
The broth of Menya Jiro’s signature ramen combines tonkotsu — “pork bones” in Japanese — and chicken, according to its website. Chefs at Menya Jiro add fried onions and garlic to the ramen noodles before serving it to customers to enhance the dish’s umami flavor.
Menya Jiro won an annual street ramen competition held in New York City twice, in 2016 and 2017. It also gained recognition from Thrillist – a website that covers food, drink, entertainment, and travel – as one of the “Best Ramen Restaurants in America.”
Menya Jiro joins Santouka, another Japanese ramen chain, in Harvard Square.
Truong said that he and his wife decided to open the Harvard Square location because of its proximity to the University.
“Harvard is a very good location because of [its] reputation and college students,” he said. “We’ve been here almost every week and we see how busy it is.”
Truong noted that the most popular dish at the restaurant since its grand opening has been the spicy Sakurajima ramen, named after an active volcano in Japan.
“We have our own noodle maker machine, so basically all our noodles are fresh [and] made daily,” he added. “That’s really much different from other ramen stores.”
Truong said he wanted to thank students and Cambridge residents for their support over the past two weeks.
“We got a lot of support from the students and the people around here. It was very good, packed almost every night. It was so crazy,” he said. “So thank you to them for that. We really appreciate the support that this neighborhood has for our restaurant.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A committee examining the climate within Harvard’s Anthropology department recommended in a final report this month that the department establish a code of conduct, allow access to third-party arbitration in misconduct investigations, and order an external review when “powerful” figures in the department are accused of sexual misconduct.
The department formed a Standing Committee for a Supportive Departmental Community last year following an investigation by The Crimson that revealed three male faculty — former department chairs Theodore C. Bestor and Gary Urton and professor John L. Comaroff — faced allegations of sexual harassment, and that dozens of current and past students said the department’s culture disadvantaged women.
Following The Crimson's reporting, Harvard suspended both Urton and Comaroff, and barred Urton from campus last month. Bestor died this month.
Alongside the release of the committee’s final report on July 1, Anthropology chair Ajantha Subramanian wrote in an email to the department that it constitutes the “beginning of a long and challenging process of cultural change.”
“While the department does not have the authority to investigate and sanction abuse, we are determined to foster an environment where even the most powerful departmental members are held to account for everyday incivilities and sustained abuses, and where those who experience harm feel empowered to speak out and be heard,” Subramanian wrote.
Approximately 50 faculty, staff, graduate students, undergraduates, and alumni participated in the committee, organized into eight subcommittees — each tasked with evaluating the department’s strengths and weaknesses in an area. One subcommittee identified problems with University policies and processes related to Title IX, while other subcommittees assessed department diversity, career preparation, advising, curriculum, accountability, and engagement.
Anthropology professor Christina G. Warinner, who chaired the full committee, said in an interview she believes the “enormous amount of work” the committee put in over the last year as “absolutely worth it.” She noted the process to implement recommendations is just beginning.
“Over the course of this past year, we’ve really listened to each other in a way that, I think, maybe hadn't happened in a while,” she said. “I think many of those recommendations are things we can do.”
The committee created departmental diversity and values statements and suggested creating interdisciplinary tracks for students to work with a range of faculty, developing guidelines for professional working relationships, and organizing an annual faculty retreat to discuss goals.
The committee also contributed to the creation of a department-wide climate survey on topics including discrimination, department activities, and career trajectories sent to current department members and alumni. Current and recent department members were invited to participate in the survey, which was administered by external consultant Edith Onderick-Harvey.
Thirty-three percent of graduate students who responded to the survey reported feeling disrespected by faculty other than their primary advisor. Fifty-seven percent of department staff respondents reported feeling disrespected by faculty, and 43 percent reported being disrespected by department leadership.
Some department affiliates involved with the committee raised concerns about how it was run.
Bridget Alex, a Ph.D graduate who served on the subcommittee examining department engagement, said she was concerned the lack of compensation for members of the standing committee impacted its inclusivity. Alex said she and other alumni requested compensation for serving on the committee, but their request was denied.
“We did make several intentional requests that, like, ‘Look if you really want people to help out and be dedicated to this, you need to pay them,’” she said. “We spend our time working on this stuff, while we could be working on other things like academic articles that actually advance our careers instead of meeting in committees and committees to write reports that nobody looks at.”
Warinner wrote in an email that the department shared the request for financial compensation with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences administration and it was denied. College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the potential for compensation for committee members.
Six Ph.D students and one faculty member resigned from their respective subcommittees before the completion of the report.
Jessica McNeil, one of those Ph.D students, said she resigned because she did not feel the committee could make the rapid changes she felt were necessary.
The goal of the committee — to undertake a long-term evaluation of the existing structures in the department — was “wonderful,” McNeil said, but her desire was to “knock these things down.”
“I simply wasn’t able to participate in a way that was productive or measured, because I was too fueled by this desperation and sort of rage that I wanted to see things changed,” she said. “I didn’t want to negotiate with these structures.”
Paul Clarke, another Ph.D student who resigned, wrote in an email that he left his role because he felt committee members lacked “equal say on how the department would be structured going forward.”
“In February, it became clear that the committee was not as democratic as it was sold to be, and that the [head of the committee] had the power to set the agenda and shape the final result,” he wrote. “They were not open to changing that structure to be more democratic, so I resigned.”
According to Warinner, the final report “directly reflects the voices of the members” of the standing committee.
“Each subcommittee had a flat structure with an administrative chair, and decision making was determined by consensus,” she wrote in an email. “The writing of the report was collaborative, and all members were able to contribute to their subcommittee report, and all standing committee representatives were able to contribute to the overall report.”
Carrie J. Brezine, a Ph.D graduate who served on the subcommittee focused on reviewing institutional resources, said power dynamics, such as those between students and faculty, made collaboration difficult.
“Efforts were made to try to create a level playing field and try to bring everyone in as equals, as collaborators ... and I do believe that the people involved sincerely wanted that to be the case,” Brezine said. “But if you are a student, it is — even when that is the stated premise — it is very difficult to tell a cadre of tenured professors what your actual experience is.”
“That power dynamic doesn’t go away just because someone has stated that, ‘We're all equal collaborators in this system,’” she added.
Warinner wrote in an email that the department will continue its work to address challenges associated with student-faculty relationships. She also wrote that the department is resolute on implementing the final report’s recommendations and is preparing for the next iteration of the standing committee.
“The standing committee will continue its work, and the department is already in the process of preparing for the 2021-2022 standing committee, which will form at the beginning of the fall academic term,” she wrote. “The goal of the 2021-2022 standing committee next year and in future years is to implement the short-term and long-term changes recommended by the standing committee report.”
But Brezine said she is concerned about how the department will implement the report’s recommendations.
“I understand that many of the changes that are being asked for feel threatening — they feel threatening to established faculty, they may feel threatening to people that, in one way or another, have the benefits of many of these structural inequalities,” she said. “But at the same time, that is something that is going to need to change if the community is going to move forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University will continue to require masks indoors regardless of vaccination status as the Delta variant has driven a nationwide rise in coronavirus cases, Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen wrote in an email to Harvard affiliates on Wednesday.
Nguyen wrote that HUHS continues to monitor the situation with Delta, but announced no changes to campus policies besides an extension of the indoor mask mandate. Harvard announced in May that it would require all students, staff, and faculty to be vaccinated to return to campus this fall.
“Our best weapon against the Delta variant is campus-wide vaccination,” Nguyen wrote Wednesday. “The vaccines work in preventing serious infections. A small percentage of vaccinated persons have experienced “breakthrough” infections, but these cases tend to have mild or moderate symptoms (or no symptoms).”
Wednesday also marks the first day of relaxed testing cadences for affiliates on campus, which were announced earlier this month. Frequency requirements range from once every other week to twice per week depending on vaccination status, presence on campus, and local infection rates.
Compared to testing requirements over the summer, the new cadences are more spaced out for vaccinated individuals: those who are vaccinated and living in undergraduate housing must submit tests once per week, rather than twice a week. All other vaccinated and on-campus affiliates must submit tests once every other week, rather than once a week.
In a July 15 interview with the Harvard Gazette — a University-run publication — Nguyen explained that Covid-19 vaccinations and the decrease in local infection rates has allowed for less frequent testing, but that continuing testing remains important.
“Testing, even less frequently, still allows us to keep an eye on infections in our community, including among vaccinated individuals,” he wrote. “For unvaccinated people we are not changing the testing cadence, since infections are more likely to occur among unvaccinated members of our community.”
As announced on May 28, Harvard will require Covid-19 vaccination from all Harvard affiliates spending time on campus in the fall, though individuals may seek an exemption. International students unable to obtain Covid-19 vaccination before coming to campus will not need to be quarantined if asymptomatic and can get vaccinated at HUHS’s weekly vaccine clinics. Individuals who remain unvaccinated for any reason may be subject to additional Covid-19 testing and masking requirements.
Nguyen wrote on July 8 that Harvard has received proof of vaccination from more than 30,000 University affiliates. Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an email that HUHS does not have updated numbers as of Wednesday.
As of May 29, on-campus individuals no longer need to complete Crimson Clear — a daily symptom attestation — every day, though still should if they have tested positive, been exposed to Covid-19, or are experiencing symptoms.
Though Harvard will continue to require masks indoors, physical distancing is no longer required indoors or outdoors for vaccinated individuals as of July 15. Those who are unvaccinated will still need to physically distance themselves indoors.
In the interview with the Gazette, Nguyen also expressed concern about the emergence of the Delta variant, describing it as “one of the biggest challenges that we’re facing in this country and globally right now.” To protect against further mutation of the variant and its more extreme symptoms, Nguyen urged individuals to get vaccinated.
“You can expect that you will likely be as safe on campus as anywhere else, as the state and surrounding communities have lifted restrictions, because we have been very thoughtful and careful in ensuring that we’re thinking first about the safety of our community members as we approach this next phase of re-opening campus more broadly,” Nguyen told the Gazette.
