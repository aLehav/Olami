[Editor's note: DC Comics' "The New 52" initiative aims to bring a new audience into the DC Universe by rebooting or significantly changing all of their superheroes and restarting them back at issue #1. In this series, the comic book newbies of The Crimson attempt to evaluate the quality and accessibility of The New 52.   —Brian Feldman, Arts Web Editor]
DC Comics holds a role so powerfully prominent in American culture that many of its characters have become household names. Yet its masterful stories have become extremely convoluted, so much so that new readers wishing to learn the backgrounds of their favorite superheroes found it difficult to catch up without starting from the very beginning of the entire series. All of this has led up to the release of the new Action Comics #1. Can DC bring in new readers with America’s greatest icon, Superman?
The new issue begins with Superman's grandiose, action-packed entrance, crashing a gathering of high-class criminals. Superman makes an ominous and powerful statement: “I’m your worst nightmare.”
The first few pages proceed to depict a chaotic fight scene between Superman and a gang of greedy businessmen. For a reader who only recently entered the world of superheroes, the lack of character exposition and the abruptness of all the action are dizzying at first. Yet among all the confusion, Rags Morales' detailed artwork shines through with his intricate attention to Superman’s red-and-blue costume and the intense expressions on each character’s face.
Before long, the first conflict screeches to a sudden halt, allowing finally for some exposition and narrative detail. Of course the military hungers for the awesome powers that Superman exhibits and will stop at no costs to obtain them. A few major characters are introduced, namely the military general Sam Lane and his sketchy consultant Lex Luthor, though the identities of these characters might not be apparent to new readers. It is also a relief to see that familiar names like Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane are introduced as new characters, whose backgrounds will hopefully develop with the publication of further issues.
The first issue of “Action Comics” successfully supplies the necessary scenes to evolve into several fully-fledged storylines in the future. Writer Grant Morrison shows Superman as Clark Kent and the need to keep his identities separate to avoid danger. There is also a conflict developing between Clark and his associates Jimmy and Lois, who work for a competitor to Supes' own Daily Planet. Through a scene reminiscent of “The Incredibles” where Superman stops a speeding train to save the passengers, we begin to see the forces of good and evil at play. Superman, a symbol of goodness and justice, possesses the altruism and courage to sacrifice his own well-being to defend the lives of the helpless. Indeed, at the end of the issue, a classic comic book cliffhanger places him in the hands of his enemies.
Although this issue of Superman is confusing at times (further exacerbated by the lack of transition between plot points), the abundance of timeless graphic-novel action and the expertise with which the Morrison and Morales handle the development of suspense is sure to keep readers interested. The intricacies of each panel are a pleasure to examine.
Diehard fans may cringe at the thought of starting over at issue #1. For new readers, however, the newly designed Superman is a great way to learn about one of America’s cultural giants. If this issue is any indication of the excitement that is to come in future issues, then Superman is indeed off to a very good start.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The results of the Undergraduate Council general election were released on Friday, revealing a promising increase in female representation.
Ninety-nine students ran for a total of 51 open positions. Many of the races proved competitive—in the Ivy Yard, 42 candidates competed for 3 spots.
The Council welcomed 19 female members, increasing female representation to 37 percent from 25 percent last year.
“Female underrepresentation has been a bit of a problem,” said UC President Senan Ebrahim ’12. “That is a lot of improvement for one year.”
Among freshman members of the UC, female representation jumped from 8 percent to 25 percent.
Quincy Representative Jennifer Q. Zhu ’14 was the only freshman female on the UC last year. She said the UC adopted several initiatives aimed at encouraging more female representation on the Council, including workshops and office hours sharing effective campaign techniques.
Zhu said she felt female candidates last year tended to be less aggressive in their campaign strategies.
“I remember seeing a bunch of guys going door to door while most of the girls would just slip notes under the door,” she said. “So while half the candidates were male and half were female, this did not spill over to the results.”
This year too, despite a considerable proportion of females running, the winners were disproportionately male.
“In my yard, more girls ran than guys,” said C.C. Gong ’15, Oak Yard representative and one of three freshman females elected to the UC. “So I don’t think it is an issue of who is running.”
New Ivy Yard representative Salena Cui ’15 agreed. “Quite a few girls were campaigning,” she said. “People just tend to vote for male candidates more.”
The new members said they did not think that an imbalanced gender ratio would affect their experience or the effectiveness of the UC.
“Girls and guys look from different perspectives and bring different ideas to the table,” Cui said. “But in general, everyone has an idea about what changes they hope to see at Harvard and I do not think this will differ much between guys and girls.”
Zhu, who is also a Crimson photographer, said she does not think gender affected her performance on the Council last year. “I think it is important to encourage girls to run and take the risk,” she said. “But in the end, a quality candidate is a quality candidate.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The difference was day and night.
Last week, Harvard dropped an error-riddled game to Holy Cross. After  controlling the first quarter, the Crimson had to play catch-up all  day.
But playing Friday night under the lights, it was a different story.  Harvard (1-1, 1-0 Ivy) took the lead on a touchdown late in the first  quarter, and the team held it all night, beating Brown (1-1, 0-1), 24-7.  With the win, the Crimson remains undefeated all time in night games at  home.
Harvard coach Tim Murphy took a major gamble in the first quarter. It  paid off for the Crimson, putting the team in position to take the  early seven-point lead over the Bears and setting a tone for the rest of  the game.
On fourth and three, the Crimson faked a field goal from the Brown  six-yard line. Junior quarterback Colton Chapple—holding the  kick—scrambled for five yards for the first down, and Harvard scored on  its next play.
“We had talked about it early in the week, that the way they run  their field goal [defense], they’re going to wait until the last second,  and they’re going to leave,” Murphy said.
Treavor Scales scored on the ensuing play on a one-yard run. It was  his only touchdown of the night, but the back ran for 129 yards in the  home opener.
The Crimson added its second touchdown early in the second frame on  20-yard pass from Chapple to sophomore tight end Cameron Brate, pushing  its lead to 14-0.
Chapple—starting in place of injured senior Collier Winters—was a  solid substitute all evening, throwing for two touchdowns and 207 yards  in his first start of the year. Winters suffered a minor hamstring  injury in last Saturday’s game and was scratched from the start early in  the week, Murphy said.
“He was still bugging me right up until game time, but I made the  decision early in the week because it wouldn’t have been fair to the  team to invest practice time in him if he was going to go down,” Murphy  said. “It was an easy decision.”
Throughout the night, both teams—and a crowd of 18,565—battled heavy  rainfall, and a slippery ball seemed to especially impact the Bears  offensive effort, as Brown suffered several critical red-zone turnovers.
With the Bears on Harvard’s nine-yard line, Brown quarterback Kyle  Newhall-Caballero threw his first interception of the night.  Senior defensive back Dan Minamide caught the errant toss and took a  knee for the touchback.
“He was kind of staring it down the entire time, and I think our  coaches did a great job game-planning,” Minamide said. “I knew they  wanted to get the ball to [Alexander Tounkara-Kone]—he’s their stud … I  ended up just being in the right place, and Kyle threw it right to me.”
But the Bears’ biggest blunder of the night came at the start of the fourth  quarter. After a 30-yard touchdown pass from Newhall-Caballero in the third frame, Brown was down seven with the ball on Harvard’s two. The  Bears looked poised to tie the game.
Newhall-Caballero botched the snap, and the Crimson recovered the fumble on its own one.
“When it comes down to it, we dropped one in the endzone, and then we  fumbled one on the one-yard line. And that certainly makes a difference  in the game,” Brown coach Phil Estes said. “We just squandered too many  opportunities.”
After a second blown red-zone opportunity for the Bears, Harvard  controlled the rest of the night. Chapple found a wide-open senior wide  receiver Adam Chrissis down the right sideline for a 59-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter,  pushing the score to 21-7.
Just 15 seconds later, junior defensive end John Lyon intercepted  Newhall-Caballero’s deflected pass to give Harvard excellent field  position on Brown’s 30.
It was Newhall-Caballero’s second of three interceptions, and a  Harvard field goal with three minutes left in the game all but sealed  the Crimson win.
“We really did a good job on the back end. We got good pressure up  front, and we contained [Newhall-Caballero],” Murphy said. “[On Friday  night], the errors were small—they weren’t glaring. We kept the ball in  front of us.
With the win, Harvard maintains a streak of not losing two consecutive games that dates back to the 2007 season.
“At the beginning of the year, we have to develop an identity as a  team, and I think tonight we developed an identity,” Murphy said. “We’re  a tough, physical team.”

Despite Harvard University boasting a 24-court tennis facility, varsity and recreational players alike were left searching for a place to hit throughout the fall.
Beginning just weeks prior to freshman move-in, the courts at the Beren Tennis Center and Murr Centers underwent complete court resurfacing. The construction, which was recently completed, left Harvard’s tennis community in search of a place to play.
Many ventured over to the QRAC’s four-court venue, where a unique blend of community members, club players, and varsity athletes converged in search of court space.
While the resurfacing may have caused frustration, many feel the pristine new courts were worth the wait. The completed courts—six located at the Murr center and 18 at the Beren Tennis Center—boast a fresh new paint job modeled after the US Open’s blue courts.
The new courts will see their first action this weekend as Harvard hosts the Chowder Fest Tournament featuring defending NCAA National Champion USC, Michigan, and Texas A&M.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Friday night’s Ivy season opener for both Harvard (4-4, 1-0 Ivy) and the University of Pennsylvania (5-2, 0-1), the Crimson took advantage of wet conditions and the Quakers’ sluggish start to grab a 2-0 victory against last year’s Ancient Eight champs.
“We’ve been in their spot before, and it’s hard,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said in reference to the season following the Crimson’s championship victory in ’09. “Our team, everybody [in the league], is going to bring their unbelievable best against the Ivy champs—no doubt about it. We just tried to focus on us, and we made a step forward today.”
Co-captain Melanie Baskind scored both of Harvard’s tallies in the first 20 minutes of the match against Penn goalie Sarah Banks, who had allowed only two goals in the entire preseason. Both times Crimson sophomore Peyton Johnson was credited with the assist.
“I think we did all of the little things right tonight,” Baskind said. “It’s about respecting your opponent and coming to play. You know they’re going to bring their best. It’s a new season, everyone’s on the same page.”
Johnson created Harvard’s first opportunity with a cross in front of the Quaker goal, where a waiting Baskind took the pass and knocked it into the back right corner of the net.
Then in the 25th minute, off of a Johnson corner kick—one of six the Crimson took on the night—Baskind again converted an opportunity into points.
Baskind’s two goals moved her into a seventh-place tie with Robin Johnston ’93 on Harvard’s career scoring list.
“What a way to start out, and they were clinical finishes,” Leone said. “[She was] very, very good, but it was a team effort—she’ll be first to tell you.”
While the offense played what Leone said was the sharpest soccer his squad has shown this season, it was the defensive end that stepped up against the Quakers.
“Defensively, that is the performance of the season by far,” Baskind stated. “Penn is an excellent team, so for us to win tonight, that was a big deal. This was such a team win; we’re just looking forward to the next one.”
Despite the wet conditions and a constant downpour, the Crimson’s defense provided the needed stability, including sophomore Rebecca Millock and freshman goalie Bethany Kanten, who completed one of the biggest saves of the night.
Millock headed and diverted a Penn shot out of the box, which was immediately sent back in by the Quakers.
Moving out of the net, Kanten’s quick push against the ball cleared out a potentially dangerous situation for Harvard.
“We’re a good, fast, technical team, so it helps that we have a good touch on the ball to start with, and make sure we’re conscious of the fact that it’s wet and it’s going to skip,” Baskind said. “[With the rain you] have to be aggressive and be ready for surprises.”
Penn attempted a comeback in the second half, making sharper passes and taking six shots on goal.
But the Quakers missed the power of defending Ivy Rookie of the Year Kerry Scalora, who suffered an injury last weekend against George Mason. Without Scalora—who has scored five goals this season—the Crimson back line stayed tight letting its offense respond with 11 shots of its own in the last 45 minutes.
For Harvard’s captains and coach, what showed the most progress was how eight Crimson players took shots against the defending Ivy champs, tallying up 16 total for Harvard.
“It’s a testament to the depth of our team. We have a lot of different players who can play in multiple positions,” Baskind said. “It’s awesome this year. Every single person who has started has started for a reason because they bring something to the table.”
“The people coming off the bench have been fantastic,” Baskind added. “At this point, we’ve got 20-plus players who have real game experience, which is awesome going into league play.”
The Crimson backline’s strips and saves helped out freshmen goalkeepers Cheta Emba and Kanten in their first Ivy appearances. Emba played the first half saving one shot on goal, while Kanten appeared the second half making three saves.
“You don’t know what’s going to happen, but the [freshmen in goal] were calm, cool, collected, and communicative so I was really pleased with their performance,” Leone said.
Harvard hopes to continue the momentum as it prepares for its match-up against Yale next weekend.
“Yale is definitely on our minds,” Baskind said. “It’s Harvard-Yale—enough said.”

Playing in front of a packed crowd at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium, the Harvard men’s soccer team (2-4) fell, 1-0, to Stanford (2-4-1) Friday night in Palo Alto, Calif.
The match was largely a defensive struggle until the 42nd minute when Stanford midfielder Eric Anderson sent a long cross deep into the Harvard penalty box off a free kick. The cross found Cardinal forward Adam Jahn, who headed the ball past senior Harvard keeper Austin Harms for the score.
The Crimson looks to regain its form in the coming days as it visits Santa Clara University on Sunday.

After a four day "Spring Preview" last semester, Cabot Café will officially open on Sunday, September 25 at 8:00 p.m. Located in the basement of Cabot E entryway, the Café will be an alternative to normal Brain Break fare, serving students espressos, teas, and a variety of baked goods, including pies, cookies, and scones.
Open Sunday through Thursday from 8:00 p.m. to midnight, the Café will add to the College's limited social space, a contentious issue among students and administrators. Cabot House Committee Co-Chair James E. Hawrot '12 said that he sees the Café as way for students to work with their friends in a social setting without having to leave campus.
"I know people work well at Starbucks," he said. "It's nice to have that feel in residential life here." The Café is located in a newly updated and furnished space and is staffed by thirteen trained baristas.
While baristas certainly add to the coffee shop aesthetic, the Café also plans to bring in live performers and to host to on-campus events. In this way, Hawrot says that he sees Cabot Café as the perfect way to "liven up Quad life" by using a space that was underutilized in the past. These performances will undoubtedly be welcomed by students in the Quad, who often have to travel to other Houses or off-campus to engage in much of campus social life.

On July 28th, Boston launched a new bike-sharing system: the New Balance Hubway. "We're already up to 3000 annual members. 75,000 rides have been taken so far. These numbers are much better than we predicted—it took similar cities far longer to get to these numbers," said Mary F. McLaughlin, marketing manager of Alta Bicycle Sharing, the operator of Boston's Hubway project. Bike sharing has already caught on in Boston, and plans are underway to expand across the Charles in the coming spring.
Clearly, the concept of bicycle-sharing has caught on quickly, but what makes it more appealing than owning your own bike or riding the T? McLaughlin says that she actually sees the Hubway as an extension of the T.
"It's just often easier to jump on a bike and ride around town. It can actually take less time to get from one place to another on a bike, as you don't have to wait for the T to arrive. Besides, many people don’t have the space to store a bike, and the Hubway makes things so convenient. Our stations all have lock systems, and the bikes are well-maintained because each bike is checked monthly," she said.
The Hubway is sponsored in part by New Balance and is a City of Boston project, part of Mayor Menino's efforts to make Boston more environmentally-friendly. The mayor's office has been running bike safety classes, and the Hubway has been distributing free helmets at its events, advertised on its Facebook page. Though the regular annual membership price is $85, a special discount running until October 1st prices membership at $60. Annual members can take bikes out for up to 30 minutes at time, or longer with additional charges. There are also "casual user" plans, memberships for 1 or 3 days.
The Hubway currently has 600 bikes and 61 stations. The closest stations are near Harvard Stadium, Allston (Western Ave/Soldiers Field), and Harvard Business  School. McLaughlin confirms that they plan to expand closer to Harvard next March. "The Hubway closes for the winter (December – February) because the snow makes it hard to maintain the bikes. But our planning division has looked at density and feasibility studies and Cambridge is on board for some stations in the spring."
Another avenue for students interested in bike-sharing is CrimsonBikes. Originally called LevBikes, it was founded by Charles T. James '10. "We currently have three stations, in front of Lowell, Cabot, and Leverett," James said, "and we're planning to open three others this fall." A CrimsonBikes membership allows users to borrow a bike for up to eight hours at a time. Memberships are $20 per semester or $35 for the year.

Of the different entrée options he had for lunch at the dining hall on Saturday—from tomato quiche to golden nuggets—Caspar W. F. Jopling '14 picked up an innocent-looking sandwich with the label, "Buffalo Chicken Sub."
"I thought [the sandwich] was pretty nice," Jopling said. "Perhaps a little dry and a bit spicy, but nice nonetheless."
But some may have been surprised to read the ingredients of such an unassuming sub.
According to the nutrition facts on the Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services' website, each serving of the sub had 1159 calories, 85.6 grams of fat, and 2467.5 milligrams of sodium. In comparison, McDonald's Big Mac has 540 calories, 29 grams of fat, and 1040 mg of sodium.
HUHDS's Buffalo Chicken Sub lists bleu cheese dressing as its first ingredient, which is made of cream, egg yolk, and high fructose corn syrup, followed by a list of ingredients that is difficult to pronounce, including Carrageenan and dipotassium phosphates. Then comes French bread and southern style chicken tender. In total, there were 240 words in the ingredients.
Jopling said the sub—a simple meal of chicken and bread—did not strike him as particularly unhealthy. He added that he would like to know beforehand what he is eating, and would prefer the nutrition facts to be on the label rather than on the website.
Luckily, Jopling, a rower on the Harvard men's heavyweight crew team, said he was not too bothered by what he ate for lunch because he had a hard practice that morning.
