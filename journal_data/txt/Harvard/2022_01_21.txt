After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Anthropology and African and African-American Studies professor John L. Comaroff was placed on unpaid administrative leave Thursday after University investigations found that he violated the school’s sexual harassment and professional conduct policies.
Comaroff, who has taught at Harvard since 2012, will be barred from teaching required courses and taking on any additional graduate student advisees through the next academic year, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay announced in an email to Anthropology and AAAS affiliates Thursday morning.
Comaroff was placed on paid administrative leave in August 2020 after an investigation by The Crimson found that at least three female students were in contact with the University’s Title IX Office regarding allegations of unwanted touching, verbal sexual harassment, and professional retaliation by Comaroff.
Reviews conducted by Harvard’s Office of Dispute Resolution and the FAS found that Comaroff “engaged in verbal conduct that violated the FAS Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment Policy and the FAS Professional Conduct Policy,” Gay wrote Thursday.
“The findings of these reviews support the conclusion that Professor Comaroff’s conduct has violated the fundamental norms of our community,” Gay wrote. “In my role as FAS Dean, I have determined that sanctions are warranted and proportionate to the severity of the behavior.”
In a statement Thursday, Comaroff denied the allegations of misconduct.
“I categorically deny all the accusations against me and object strongly to the University’s failure to accord me a fair process and to respect my academic judgment,” he wrote.
A press release issued by Comaroff’s legal team said that in a separate inquiry stemming from Title IX complaints, investigators found Comaroff responsible for one incident of verbal sexual harassment “arising from a brief conversation during an office hour advising session.” But the release said that investigators found “no sexual or romantic intention.”
“Upon receipt of these results, Harvard opened a second, kangaroo court process – lacking the most elemental aspects of due process and artificially limited to a defective record – to reexamine conduct already thoroughly investigated in the Title IX process,” the release said of the FAS inquiry.
“This process resulted in an illegitimate finding that Professor Comaroff was responsible for alleged unprofessional (but entirely non-sexual) conduct in another office hours advising session,” it added. “Even in the latter proceedings, the factfinder concluded that the alleged harm ‘may not have been intended.’”
Comaroff will not be allowed to chair any dissertation committees, according to Gay. Comaroff’s current graduate student advisees must have at least one other co-advisor or may also choose to switch advisors with support provided by Harvard, Gay wrote.
Gay added that after the next academic year, she will decide “whether to restore some or all of these privileges.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Christine A. Elow was sworn in as commissioner of the Cambridge Police Department earlier this week, making her the first woman ever to lead the force.
Elow served as acting commissioner of the department for nearly five months following the departure of Branville G. Bard Jr. in August. She took over the post full-time on Tuesday after a private swearing-in ceremony at CPD headquarters.
Elow was also the first woman to serve as a CPD superintendent, a position she held for five years prior to taking over as acting commissioner.
In a CPD press release, Elow said she was “honored” to have the chance to lead the department, adding that she hopes CPD can be “the model for policing” nationally.
“My entire career has been dedicated to serving the Cambridge community. I grew up in Cambridge and love working in this city,” Elow said. “I will remain committed to bringing change and transformation to public safety and working collaboratively with the community.”
Elow, who was raised in Cambridgeport, is the first native Cantabrigian to serve as CPD commissioner, according to the city press release. She has served in the department since 1995, when she joined as a patrol officer after four years in the U.S. Navy.
Tyrone Bellitti, co-founder of the Cambridge branch of My Brother’s Keeper, a youth-advocacy initiative, said Elow’s lived experience in the city will be an asset to her tenure as commissioner.
“She’s been involved through so many different iterations of Cambridge’s history,” Bellitti said. “That firsthand experience and knowledge of the city and its evolution, it’s critical to her ability to help lead the seat that she’s in currently.”
During the summer of 2020, Bellitti worked with Cambridge city officials, including Elow, to support MBK Cambridge’s local youth outreach programs. Bellitti said Elow was a “key component” in getting support from the city.
“Working with Elow during those sessions, it was, you know, whatever we needed to help impact Cambridge kids in a positive way, we had her support,” he said.
City Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan, who supports police demilitarization, said that Elow’s appointment is “certainly progress,” but added that she must be open to major public safety reform in Cambridge.
“We need transformation in our public safety approach, and that’s the most important aspect of this from my point of view — how willing she will prove to be in terms of achieving that transformation,” Zondervan said. “Business as usual is not acceptable to the impacted communities.”
Elow steps into her role as the Cambridge City Council is considering alternatives to traditional police responses that would limit direct intervention from officers in some instances. In June, the council approved a policy order asking the city manager to explore funding the non-profit Holistic Emergency Alternative Response Team, which describes itself as “an alternative safety program outside of policing systems.”
In an October conversation with the Public Square, a public access television show, Elow said any changes to emergency response must be gradual.
“There are so many calls that we’re responding to now that would be so much better suited for an alternative response,” Elow said. “Having a proposal like HEART — I think that this can happen, and I think it’s going to happen in layers.”
“I don’t think you can just start it off at zero to 60,” she added.
Bellitti, who served on the city’s public safety task force, said Elow has “embraced” the conversation about alternative public safety models.
“She’s been at the table from day one, and a huge supporter of doing things different,” Belitti said. “She admits to our flaws and she speaks to our flaws, but then she also speaks to the solutions.”
