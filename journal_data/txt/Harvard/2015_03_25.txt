It was amidst the teased hair, ripped jeans, and Madonna fever of the ’80s that the homemade mixtape achieved widespread popularity and became a staple of American youth culture. Nowadays, however, there is little need to make a personal playlist. Services like Songza or Spotify instantly provide one for any occasion, from “A Profoundly Funky Dance Party” to “A City Driving Adventure.” Yet a handmade playlist succeeds profoundly at something many are constantly trying to achieve on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and countless other platforms: sharing ourselves so that we may be understood. As Rolling Stone contributing editor and author Rob Sheffield writes in his memoir from which this piece gets its title, “The times you lived through, the people you shared those times with—nothing brings it all to life like an old mix tape. It does a better job of storing up memories than actual brain tissue can do. Every mix tape tells a story. Put them together, and they add up to the story of a life.”
It is arguably this ability of mixtapes to effectively convey what is difficult to put into words that has popularized its function as a love letter. As with a love letter, one must express his or her affections without the guarantee of being understood or reciprocated. The particular importance placed on music as a form of personal expression adds to the anxiety, for each song selection puts one’s tastes out in the open to be judged by the person whose opinion he or she cares about the most. Perhaps people take the risk and jump into that void because it is precisely in that vulnerable space that meaningful connection can occur. The act of creating a mixtape is a manifestation of the desire to reach that place, as each track is added in the hopes of experiencing that moment when two people realize they love the same obscure or embarrassing song.
The mixtape is to digital playlists what letters have become to emails: the outdated, unfashionable older sibling. Putting one together is often a long and challenging process. Mixtape-makers must sift through countless songs to compile the set that comes closest to voicing exactly what he or she wants to express. Then comes the headache of trying out one configuration after another until the perfect combination emerges. Finally: the act of physical creation, whether it involves recording songs on a cassette, burning files onto a CD, or even adding a drawing or personal message to the packaging. Time-consuming as this may be, the struggle is what valorizes the process—it provides the opportunity to value the means rather than focus purely on the ends.
Choosing songs for a romantic mixtape can be a particularly tricky task. Thankfully, executed well, the love song’s greatest gift is its ability to utilize the tools of melody and lyric to capture the powerful and fleeting emotions of love. A love song can be like a Taylor Swift track, allowing listeners to indulge in the fantasy of love without the premature burden of grandiose promises of forever, carelessly jumping around together screaming “Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.” Songs like Adele’s “Daydreamer” and Lauryn Hill’s duet with D’Angelo, “Nothing Even Matters,” depict a romance in which so many want to believe and can—at least for the duration of the song. These are the songs that capture the time when a romance is budding, for when Adele sings about how love changes everything about her life or Hill and D’Angelo express their passion for each other, they tap into the hope new lovers have for the future.
Other songs exist outside the dream world and paint a portrait of imperfect love. Lorde’s “400 Lux” grounds the development of relationships in reality. In it she sings, “We’re never done with killing time / Can I kill it with you?” While exposing the banality of life, she also conveys the simple beauty of sharing those mundane moments with someone else. The xx cogently capture the vulnerability of asking for this kind of love. When the straightforward lyrics of “Heart Skipped A Beat” like “sometimes, I still need you” pierce through their delicate soundscapes, the juxtaposition of the words’ simplicity and the production’s complexity is startling. The intimacy that the lyrics of both Lorde and The xx request of the listener may be intimidating at the onset of a relationship. However, the inclusion of these types of songs on mixtapes expose deeper parts of relationships, parts that may only become relatable once experienced.
The mixtape derives its power from its capacity to include all these experiences of love, every three to five minute block representing different gradations of a relationship. The listening process is often hued with nostalgia, as each song reminds the listeners of both the memories that inspired the track’s selection and the ones that came after sharing it. In this way, a mixtape can become a permanent record of the trajectory of one's feelings and can remain so even after the end of a relationship. These emotions may never be accessible again, but their essence remains forever within the 70 to 80 minutes of music that was once put together and shared in the name of love.
“I let my tape rock ’til my tape popped.”—The Notorious B.I.G.

There’d been no soup course at their wedding, she didn’t think. Or if there had been, it had leaked into the toilet by the time they had left. The cloy of champagne still furred their teeth when the bellboy showed them to the room that night, smiling. “Congratulations,” he said. Lai tipped him extra.
Maria saw that Lai’s eyes snapped wider when he stepped into the room. His cheeks had grown mottled as he came down from drunkenness. He toed off his shoes and walked around the room, touching with his usual precision the polished mahogany desk, the crystal vase, the bouquet of flowers still bundled in waxy paper on the bed. He picked up the flowers, then frowning, said, “I should thank your parents.”
“Don’t worry about it,” Maria said. For her, everything in the room was edged in shadow. A heat spread up through her chest, separate from the shots of vodka her bridesmaids had handed to her that still sluiced her blood. “Come here.”
His socks were silent against the carpet. He kissed her, his fingers on her shoulders damp from the flowers. He tasted sour. Maria tried to shake the jacket off his shoulders. He laughed against her mouth, his lips pulling taut over hers. She kept trying but could only process her movements a second after her body had moved, blackness rushing in to fill the gaps between.
“Do me instead,” she said and turned around. The dress her parents had given her had 37 ivory buttons down the back. She wanted Lai to lick a line down her spine as he unhooked each one.
He didn’t. She rubbed where the bones of the dress had dug red stripes into her hips, her stomach, pouched out from alcohol. Lai was there too, warm brown palms, the pink in his cuticles not even as light as her skin. They kissed. Lai shed his jacket onto a chair. He nudged her stumbling fingers away from the buttons on his shirt and peeled it off himself as she worked on his belt.
He made a noise in the hollow behind his teeth. Maria felt it around her tongue and pressed harder against his. He extracted himself from around her.
“Don’t give me that face, Maria. I have a surprise for you.”
“What is it now?”
He pulled a silver cigarette box out of his pants. It was thin, the metal worn dull in places.
“I just want you to fuck me,” Maria said.
Spinning it between his fingers so he touched only the sturdier end, he held a joint out to her, the paper greening under the light. “I brought this for you,” he said, and closed the box. His arm was steady, extended towards her.
Maria laughed. “You know me too well.” She took it and smelled it, and the skunkiness mingled with the sharp stink of her breath almost made her retch. “Where’s the light?”
“I have to do something first.” Lai was glancing at the things he’d inspected before. The desk, the bouquet. His eyes, trained on the bathroom, didn’t stray to where Maria’s bare feet collided with the king-size bed or to the joint she held at the middle, as she brought it again to her nose.
The edge of the bed folded beneath her knees. Lai was walking out of the bathroom, prying open a small sage box. He tossed the shower cap inside to her and started to remove rubber bands from around the stems of the bouquet.
“You’re not drunk at all, are you?” Maria said. She hadn’t watched him too closely at the reception, assuming he and his friends were tipping Jack Daniel’s up high into their mouths as both their families disapproved quietly from behind their steak and foy thong. His smile had been small and pointed, like a pebble in a shoe, every time she looked. It niggled within her and the way the alcohol seemed to broaden the night.
Maria wanted some clothes. The front of her thong stretched into her vulva, but she felt too liquid to remove it. Lai plucked the shower cap off her lap. Standing atop a chair, he filmed the shower cap over the smoke detector, stretched a rubber band halfway around it with one hand, pinching it against the plastic of the cap with the other as he rounded it to enclose the whole smoke detector. Maria remembered, watching him fasten two more, a video she had once seen in which 76 rubber bands had crushed a watermelon. Each pull of his muscles was deliberate. A line had creased between his eyebrows. He looked at the plastic bunching over the detector when he was finished, his mouth a little hard and hopeful. He put the chair back behind the desk, struck a match from a box he had taken from the lobby, and passed the joint to Maria, who blew a stream of smoke into his face. The rest curled inside her.

Andrew Lippa’s experiences run the gamut of roles within musical theater: the composer, lyricist, and performer has written songs and lyrics for original pieces and contributed to stage-adapted versions of cartoon strips, novels, films, and even an epic poem. Lippa came to Harvard on March 9 to hold a masterclass for Harvard undergraduate vocalists through the Office for the Arts. Afterward, he sat down with The Crimson to talk about his work in musical theater and his critically acclaimed oratorical, “I Am Harvey Milk.”
The Harvard Crimson: What was your experience teaching the masterclass?
Andrew Lippa: What I saw today was a group of students who clearly are passionate but not necessarily skilled in the way that I’ve seen…in programs where there is conservatory-like training. The opposite of that is the intelligence and the ferocity that they will tear into something…. They all responded and took big steps forward because there’s a deep intelligence. It was a curiously mixed experience.
THC: How do you approach adapting books and film for the stage?
AL: The prevailing thought about source material is that you find something that you fall in love with…and then you systematically have to murder this source material…because it proves to be shackling. Even if it’s a play—an animal of the stage—you’ll still find that structurally you have to get away from it…because of the ways musicals function.
THC: How did you start working on “I Am Harvey Milk”?
AL: In the fall of 2011, I got an email from San Francisco Gay Men’s Chorus artistic director Tim Seelig, and he said they were commissioning 10 to 12 composers and asking them to write a 5-minute piece based on their perceptions of Harvey Milk…. And I said, “This is wonderful. Thanks for asking, but I don’t want to write a 5-minute piece. I want to write a 60-minute piece.” I was in my late 40s at that time, and I very much wanted to write about my gay experience…how [Milk] is a towering figure in the gay rights movement, and what my connection to our gay history is…. It’s been the single greatest creative experience of my career.
THC: What about the experience was memorable for you?
AL: I got the opportunity to write an epic work—epic in the sense that I’m doing it with 1,000 singers in Denver and a 100-piece orchestra in front of 5,000 people next year…. And I suddenly got to be the lead actor in a piece I wrote, which I always wanted to do…. And I got to do it in NYC at Avery Fischer Hall at Lincoln Center with one of the world’s greatest orchestras, with my best friend conducting—Joel Fram—and one of my other best friends singing the soprano role—Kristin Chenoweth.… We’re going to take it to London and Australia, but where I really want to take is places like India and China where…it’s much harder to be gay. I really want to see us take this piece to places where it might have a cultural effect.
THC: Did you anticipate the strong positive reception of “I Am Harvey Milk”?
AL: I came in thinking that I was doing a commission for seven choruses and that it would get done seven times…. But it turns out...that’s not the story. The story is that it’s going to be much bigger. That’s the thing about being a creative artist—you don’t know how people will respond. You just do the thing that moves you. I’m not doing it for a response. I’m doing it because it means something.

A cappella singing is now such a quintessential—if not downright omnipresent—part of the college experience that it is easy to imagine that the students of Harvard have always been making music with their mouths. While it’s true that the boys have been doing it since 1946, when the Harvard Krokodiloes were founded, it wasn’t until the establishment of the Radcliffe Pitches in 1975 that the girls got their chance to join in. On March 28, the Pitches will celebrate their 40th anniversary in a concert featuring old and new alike: Both the current and founding members of the Pitches will perform.
In 1975, Kathy E. Manning ’78 and Diane L. Nabatoff ’78 decided that they, too, wanted to perform a cappella—so under the auspices of the Hasty Pudding Club, they formed the Radcliffe Pitches. That their name rhymes with an epithet sometimes used to describe Radcliffe women is no accident. Manning laughs in recollection: “We actually had a competition for the name because we had no idea what to call ourselves. When we heard the name ‘Radcliffe Pitches’ and how close it was to a very negative stereotype, we actually liked that. We viewed ourselves as being independent and competitive and wanted something that was gutsy, tough, and strong.”
Guts, toughness, and strength are evident in Manning’s retelling of an early Pitches concert. “During graduation, we sang with the Kroks at an oyster roast for seniors,” she says. “The Kroks sang first, and then we sang the only three songs we knew. It was so well-received that the audience wanted us to do an encore, and not knowing any other songs, we sang the same three songs over again.” From there, the Pitches ascended the scale of a cappella success. The next spring, after expanding their repertoire and gaining experience performing, the Pitches were invited by the Kroks to the stage of Sanders Theatre. The following fall, the Pitches hosted their own jam; soon, they released a record and went on tour.
According to Manning, the Radcliffe Pitches offered Harvard women a chance to excel at a cappella singing in a welcoming and encouraging setting. “People loved being in the group, not just because the music was so great but because it offered a kind of camaraderie and working together in a way that was very different from the day to day competition of Harvard we experienced back then,” she says. Manning also speaks highly of the Pitches as a supportive group at a time when fewer women attended the college. “This group was a great place to build friendships, work together, and develop leadership skills.”
Forty years later, the Pitches retain their strong sense of identity as a proudly all-female group. “Some think that only all-male groups can be the most elite singing groups, but we continue to show every day, when we sing and perform, that women’s groups can have really incredible sounds as well,” says Jenny H. Chang ’16, the current president of the Pitches.
Heather E. desJardins-Park ’15, the Pitches’ music director, agrees. “As a musician, there is something really different and rewarding about singing in an all-women’s group. While you don’t have the same range of voices, it is really cool when you can still achieve the same depth of sound,” she says.
Preparing for a concert that both showcases the current Pitches and celebrates the group’s history is no easy feat. They’ve added 17 new songs to their repertoire this semester rather than their customary 12, according to Chang and desJardins-Park, and have also had to take on the additional task of reaching out to the original Pitches of 1975.
But for all their time spent rehearsing and organizing the concert, the Pitches find their work far from grueling. In conducting alumnae outreach, Pitches stage manager Katie F. G. Wu ’17, says of speaking to the former Pitches, “Stories like [theirs] are in the background of all the work that we do and all the experiences we have as members of the group, so to really have a tangible feel of those memories and traditions is a special thing.”
Chang, desJardins-Park, Manning, and Wu all agree that being part of the Pitches has been an important and rewarding part of their time at Harvard. While the group has grown and changed over the past 40 years—from expanding its repertoire of jazzy standards to include some contemporary music to adding international tours to its schedule—its original mission is still central to its work. “To this day,” Chang says, “we are creating a community of strong women who work together to create and share music.”

The week immediately following spring break is the week to live voyeuristically in the breaks of others. On the walk back from the beach, a group of us laugh hysterically, remembering a few brilliant one-liners—not for the simple sake of appreciating our own cleverness, but because “from brain break to spring break” and “what if the ocean was made of tequila?” seem like apropos Facebook album titles.
An album title is more than a label. It’s ironic, really, our conversation, given that a few moments before we were lying on our towels, pointing out the bros on the beach with every variety of selfie stick under the sun (and in the crashing waves, and over their heads, and under the precariously placed lifeguard stand). A critical eye to a selfie stick quickly turns inward, leaving me wondering about the way we present our own experiences in self-archiving practices. It’s been written on extensively—are Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, etc. just monuments to our generation’s profound narcissism? Or are the applications doing something we haven’t yet managed to understand—what is the drive behind the mad rush to archive?
Lying on our towels, what was under the sandy microscope were the questions: What happens to “reality” when we obsessively document like this. Is it distortion? Is it a molding to expectation? Is it a combination of lying and peacocking afterward? What we were getting at, I think, is the deeper problem—is there such a thing as an authentic experience that we should be concerned about losing? Maybe there is nothing to be found at the “center” of all this anxiety about a malformed-at-birth or post-mortem mutilation of “reality.”
Actually, the harder I think in my social-constructionist world about all these concepts that scaffold our lives, the more I’m coming to believe that our experiences have always been defined by archives. What has changed is not that we are newly obsessed with one another’s actions and enviable experiences, associates, and sociality. It has always been a practice of ours to compare ourselves to those about whom much is written. Consider our Victorian, much-romanticized London “tón”, where the courtships, dresses, and balls were the focus of much magazine and newslore.
So the archive has always existed as a referent for the way we talk about ourselves and map our adventures. Given that the obsession with archiving is not new, what is innovative are today’s specific practices. Our archives are madly proliferated and intensely interactive. Is this abundance a way of filling what years ago would have necessarily been archival silences for certain classes, races, genders, and social groups?
The proliferation of possibilities of self-archivalism has opened the doors for writing and re-writing identities. Black Twitter has been a rich site of organizing and community grieving through a collective decrying of police brutality. Facebook is a significant modality through which people have shown solidarity against racial oppression on our campus. Let me add the caveat, however, that activism cannot be located entirely online—as a site of organizing, yes; as the only place where one makes himself relevant in allyship, no. Resources for those with asexual/ace and demisexual identities came into the stratosphere through a community forum online, and activists are still working through these terms on Tumblr and on online publics.
Looking to the contemporary makers of history is a practice we are all familiar with. Local social media stars and YouTube celebrities may take up as much of our time-of-day as TV or movie celebrities. Archives have always been a source of social anxiety and identity formation—as well they should be. Where the previous news “archive” was built around the upper class, their experience was written into society as the representative ideal. Is social media, then, to be perceived not with an atavistic eye to the loss of the authentic but rather as a form of modern democratization of history in the making?
But even if we opine such a potential “democratization,” our current archiving practices are also acutely flawed. Such a profusion of information opens all kinds of doors. The way that we code and sort through big data comes to define the archive that persists into the future. Will that only replicate the archiving bias to tend in the direction of the biographies of the upper classes that we have always seen? Interactive, profuse archiving practices with online applications may allow new self-presentation—perhaps even a new self-imagining. But is there a way for us to take a form of control over our own history making that we have never had before?

The artists:
Unlike some of his contemporaries, famed British composer Thomas Adès is an impassioned believer in art for art’s sake, eschewing any ethical or political considerations in his work. He claims that philosophical logic taints the purity of musical logic, and for this reason he despises composers such as Richard Wagner, who was openly anti-Semitic and whose music became one of the cornerstones of German culture under the Nazi regime. In an interview with music journalist Tom Service, Adès elaborates: “In Wagner every note is political and that to me is repulsive. Ethics are a distraction an artist cannot afford.”
The perspectives of photographer Jordan H. Hayashi ’16 and jazz vocalist and composer Laila Smith ’17 propose a challenge to Adès’s mode of thinking. Although “art for art’s sake” certainly does exist, art can also be as practical as it is abstract, as social and political as it is aesthetic. The examination of Jordan’s and Laila’s attitudes toward their respective crafts suggests that art is in fact an industry of the message: grounded in reality with the purpose of addressing, projecting, and transforming socio-cultural conventions.
Since the mid-20th century, social commentary has been a fundamental element of the American artistic tradition. Laila’s own artistic outlook resounds with social criticism, with a focus on the representation of young women in mainstream pop culture. She explains that many female pop stars today seem to be constructed around the brand of “the unattainable sex goddess,” which she sees as “damaging to young women as a whole” and which she yearns to refute through her music. “All I want to do is represent a multidimensional young female who critically thinks about the world,” she asserts.
Aside from a call for political action, art has also demonstrated its role in advertisements that can influence consumers’ emotions and decisions. As a photographer for both CS50 and Harvard College Admissions, Jordan fully embraces this notion of art as advertisement and artist as persuasive storyteller. While the work of many amateur photographers today embodies the notion of the snapshot, a photograph taken spontaneously and without artistic or journalistic intent, these snapshots are “not really what photographers strive for,” says Jordan. “The best pictures all tell a story. Especially for Harvard Admissions, you need to tell a story in each photo about how Harvard is the place you want to be.”
Jordan’s recent photography shows an interest not only in telling a single individual’s story but also in syncing the pulse of that story with a larger, collective narrative. In this vein, Jordan cites photographing Ghungroo 2015 as one of his most memorable and challenging projects under the Harvard Admissions umbrella. The challenge arose from his desire to capture the energy of a packed Agassiz Theater in a photo that included only the onstage performers. “The performance and the energy were driven not just by the dancers but also by the people watching them,” Jordan explains. “It’s really hard to show that sort of audience involvement in a photo that doesn’t include the audience in the frame.” Nonetheless, he stepped up to the challenge with confidence, in part because “people were really into the dancing and were having a great time. It made my job easier.” By conveying the spirit of the larger Harvard community through capturing a single production such as Ghungroo, Jordan continually aims to use photography not solely for “photography’s sake,” but rather as an effective means of promoting and endorsing the Harvard experience.
Capturing Laila’s socio-artistic platform through photography would offer a similar challenge to that which Jordan faces regularly in his work: How does one use a single frame to communicate the alignment of an individual voice with a larger, intangible message? Music photography is particularly challenging in this respect, in that it makes only a musician’s physical presence, rather than the sounds he or she produces, the centerpiece of the artistic feat at hand. The act of photographing musicians hence raises the question of whether it is justifiable to isolate these visual elements and to deem those elements in themselves a valid representation of a musician’s identity. For example, there is often debate about whether a band that is otherwise only mediocre deserves to be famous because of its members’ good looks. In Laila’s eyes, this deliberate segregation of visual and auditory components is disparaging for all involved, dividing the artist’s character into falsely discrete components while robbing the audience of the opportunity for a more wholesome artistic experience. “When we consume celebrity, I’m not convinced that we can compartmentalize what we internalize,” she explains. In addition to combating gender stereotypes, Laila hopes to use her music to encourage a move away from stratifying art and toward appreciating art more holistically and hence “becoming more mindful consumers.”
However, music photography has the potential to operate in alliance with this stance of anti-compartmentalization, as long as it aims to supplement and complete, rather than replace, its subjects’ already-existing identities. The activist undertones in Laila’s music could find strength in visual as well as musical representation; photographs could perhaps freeze more stirring moments in performance and amplify Laila’s underlying social message without nullifying the music itself. Such artistic collaboration could hence be as much a vehicle for instigating impactful social transformation as it is a means of heightening possibilities for self-expression. Although ethics and politics do complicate the creative process, they also give art a sense of direction, multidimensionality, and agency that is valuable to creator and audience alike.

The Boston Lyric Opera’s production of Czech composer Leos Janacek’s opera, “Katya Kabanova,” was an emotionally charged presentation driven by rich vocal performances and well planned staging. The production seamlessly integrated challenging melodies, lush instrumental accompaniment, and thought-provoking set design. Throughout “Katya Kabanova’s” almost 2-hour run time, these aspects of the performance continued to complement each other and never felt unbalanced, a remarkable feat.
First performed in 1921, “Katya Kabanova” revolves around the title character’s Katya’s struggle with her abusive and overbearing mother-in-law, Kabanicha, and ineffectual husband, Tichon. She finds freedom and relief in her illicit love interest, Boris, but those feelings have devastating repercussions.
In playing Katya Kabanova, Cuban-American soprano Elaine Alvarez painted a tragic portrait of a desperately unhappy heroine. Though Alvarez initially seemed hesitant in her singing, her performance grew in confidence over the course of the show. Her role required rapid switches from powerful, emotional outbursts to tender, reflective moments; she made these transitions feel natural and effortless. As is the case with many modern operas, the production infrequently placed complete emphasis on vocal performances alone and tended to integrate the singers’ voices into a greater symphonic sound. When Alvarez was unaccompanied, however, her vocal ability truly shone through. As she sang complex, dissonant passages from memory, her performance became only more electrifying and charged with emotion.
The rest of the cast gave performances that ranged from decent to outstanding. As Kabanicha, Elizabeth Byrne convincingly portrayed an overbearing mother-in-law. She sang her piercing, discordant lines in a manner that was clear and precise yet simultaneously aggressive and dominating. Sandra Piques Eddy, who played the supporting character of Varvara, the Kabanov family’s foster daughter, delivered an especially strong performance. Eddy’s vocals were rich, bright, and characterized by striking depth and complexity of timbre. The male leads, on the other hand, fulfilled their roles solidly, but with few noteworthy moments. One area in which all cast members excelled was in their believability; each managed to express great emotion on stage in both acting and singing.
The orchestra’s performance was sublime, gracefully filling the intermezzos between scenes and accentuating on-stage action with precise timing and conviction. “Katya Kabanova” opened with a strong overture, immediately setting up the tension on-stage as the music shifted between the bright and uplifting melodies of flutes and the alarming interjections of violins. Throughout the opera, the orchestra beautifully reflected the emotional twists and turns that took place on the stage.
Set design and lighting were other strong suits of the performance. Although the set was largely minimalist, cutaway set pieces lent it an added sense of depth by creating rooms into which the audience could see. These rectangular demi-walls served as framing devices that emphasized the privacy of Katya’s emotions and made her confessions of her desires and vulnerabilities feel truly genuine. The lighting of the opera was equally impressive, beautifully complementing the dominant mood of each scene. One particularly striking moment was the scene in which Katya agonized about the solitude of her suffering. As the scene progressed, the light became bleaker and colder, and the sharp, contrasting shadows it cast reflected Katya’s feelings of isolation and despair.
What most prominently characterized “Katya Kabanova,” however, was not any single stand-out performance or staging choice, but rather how well integrated each piece of the production was with all of the others. The opera was strong by all metrics—it was technically proficient, aesthetically polished, and emotionally moving. The choices made in casting, set design, and lighting were well thought out and greatly complemented the vocal performances of the singers. Despite the eponymous title, there was no singular star of this “Katya Kabanova” but rather a set of parts that together created an outstanding production.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I suspect many of us grew up with ambitious plans. Our heroes after all are not borrowed from the middle echelons of middle management, but sit at the very tops of their respective pyramids. Einsteins, Newtons, Kennedys, Gandhis, Kings. As children, in our most audacious moments, we see ourselves as astronauts, movie stars, and superheroes.
However, we all know that this delusion cannot continue for long. At some point, we must redirect our ambitions downward. We must confess that while there are always deficiencies in circumstance and flaws in opportunity, there are also inadequacies within ourselves. There are lengths to which we cannot run, no matter how hard we might try. Children who dream of being astronauts must inevitably be brought back down to Earth, and there is no better time for this to happen than at the transition point into college.
My own path towards this realization came during my freshman year. I began to realize what “smart” meant, and how high the bar actually stood. I began to see what the heroes I had read about might look like in real life. Michelangelo was 24 years old when he completed his first masterpiece—the Pietà. Steve Jobs was worth more than $100 million by the age of 25. I began to see around me the caliber of person who would go on to be labeled “genius”. I began to appreciate what world-class excellence looked like—and it looked unfamiliar.
In my pre-Harvard life, I had always been able to find refuge in my talents. There were always things I was good—perhaps even the “best”—at, and this partly meant that there were always things for me to do. Harvard however, was the first space in which I met people who were better than me in every conceivable way. People who were better than me at all of the things I valued. People who were not only more intelligent than I was, but who were also more hard-working, more compassionate, more attractive, more athletic, more social, more empathetic, and more self-aware. These were people who were quite simply better at “life” than I was. There were no more excuses; there was no more refuge. Tasks that would take me hours might take them minutes. Insights that I may never reach came easily to these people.
At Harvard we are privileged in that we were able to avoid this harsh truth for so long. Some of us are even so fortunate to be one day in the places we dreamed about as children. But how does one continue to operate under such a realization?
I don't have a solution to this conundrum. But I do think it’s best to move directly into the difficulty rather than skirting around it. I take solace in the works of existentialist philosophy, which urges us to tackle the monolithic responsibilities of life head on. Sartre, in “Existentialism is a Humanism” gives human beings three monolithic responsibilities: First, that we are wholly responsible for everything that happens to us; second, that every action we undertake is simultaneously a prescription to all of humanity; and third, that man is no more than the sum of his actions. What Sartre is doing is giving us a level of unbearable responsibility that has the capacity to crush us, and leave us paralyzed. But if we leap forward and embrace these responsibilities, what he gives us in return is an immense amount of freedom. We become wholly responsible for everything that happens to us and everything we do—both the excellent and the inadequate.
Sartre’s technique of diving forward is useful. Imagine for a moment that you truly are not good enough, and explore the consequences of such a statement. Imagine for a moment that your dreams, whatever they may be, are wholly out of your reach, and that you will never in fact be good enough. What then? For me, entertaining this thought in its entirety is massively liberating. When the burden of being “good enough” is dropped, there is so much more room for life.
As a senior I am fortunate to have come to terms with many of these insecurities, but as a freshmen these were the un-talked about realities that plagued me. In a place that is humid with the weight of constantly needing to be the best there is ego and there is bravado. It means that when the respite of external validation dries up, it can be difficult to breathe.
Instead, tear the fangs off of inadequacy and bring it out of the darkness, and in doing so, create a new, more mature definition of ambition.
I still dream of being an astronaut—but that statement means something else now.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I recently overheard a group of students grumbling over the lack of an “activist culture” at Harvard. And on principle, I agreed. Harvard, of all places, should be a stomping ground for students to express themselves, influence others, and effect change. Meanwhile, I can count on one hand the number of movements I have seen on campus this year.
Why is this the case? Because the students leading Harvard’s current activist culture—to the extent that it exists—seem more interested in making noise and getting attention than in attaining actual progress. This is leaving others understandably deterred.
Let’s look at the campaign to divest from fossil fuels. In early February, about 30 student activists streamed into Mass. Hall. They hung up a Divest Harvard banner and began a sit-in in the first floor hallway, outside the offices of University President Drew G. Faust and Provost Alan M. Garber ’76.
But I’m troubled by what followed. When Faust offered to meet with the students at a later time on the condition that they leave Mass. Hall, they refused. Throughout the 24-hour demonstration they demanded an immediate meeting, which Faust declined.
If the demonstrators were wholly focused on progress, they would have accepted the reality that the fate of divestment depends on Faust and the administration. And they would have taken Faust’s offer of furthering dialogue. However, the students’ choice to snub Faust because she did not pander to their immediate demands reflects a disregard for the movement’s envisioned goals. Instead, they prioritized the noise that came with their continued sit-in (not to mention the filmmaker they brought to the demonstration).
Yet this isn’t an entirely new approach for Divest Harvard. Last March, one of its organizers confronted Faust while walking through the Yard. The student vented a painful elevator pitch, which was recorded and posted to Vimeo. This further circumvented any progress, as exemplified by Faust later commenting, “I had hoped you would carry on your campaign with a greater degree of civility and fairness.”
Unfortunately, this mentality stretches well beyond the divestment campaign. Last semester, the post-Ferguson movement swept campus. Between a rally that shut down the Square, a march down Mount Auburn Street, and a die-in outside Memorial Church, each week featured demonstrations of larger proportions. However, each day the question of the movement’s actual goals was no less elusive
Early on, the motto Black Lives Matter was ubiquitous in both awareness and support. But the student organizers failed to use this backing to influence any sort of legislative or otherwise material change. Mass incarceration. Police brutality. Racial profiling. These were issues waiting to be discussed but ultimately never addressed, as the movement’s clamor persisted.
To reshape the activist culture on campus, the very essence of activism must change.
Change begins with student leaders acknowledging that making others uncomfortable can either distance them from a cause or help them grasp its magnitude. It begins with appreciating the difference between noise as a means and an end. And it begins with understanding that trumpeting a movement’s ideals in any way possible differs from taking the practical steps to realize those ideals. Only then can our activist culture grow.

On Monday, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas announced his intention to run for the presidency in 2016. As the first mainstream Republican to officially announce his candidacy, we must commend him for the directness with which he announced his decision to run for the office. Cruz refreshingly eschewed much of the posturing and maneuvering that comes from forming an exploratory committee to consider a run for the office, a step often considered by both serious candidates like Democrat Hillary Clinton and fringe candidates like Donald Trump. Although we believe Cruz’s straightforward announcement is commendable, we believe that his candidacy will prove detrimental to the Republican cause in the 2016 presidential race.
We believe that Ted Cruz is not the right candidate to assume the mantle of Republican leadership in 2016—a stance with which many Republicans agree, as demonstrated by recent polls. In a recent CNN poll of people who identify as Republicans, four percent said that they were likely to support Cruz’s candidacy for the nomination, compared to sixteen and thirteen percent for former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, respectively.
The candidacy of Cruz serves only to contribute to the deepening political polarization of recent years. Extremist politicians like Cruz have played a major role in creating the current political environment that is so hopelessly mired in gridlock. For example, his obstructionist tactics were notably on display in 2013 when he forced a government shutdown against the wishes of many other prominent Republican politicians and famously read “Green Eggs and Ham” on the Senate floor in a 21-hour filibuster in advance of a vote over funding the Affordable Care Act. Cruz’s candidacy increases the focus on the ideological extremism that has sadly become an integral part of the primaries.
Further, Cruz has the dangerous potential to pull the eventual Republican nominee further to the right of the political spectrum. Because primary voters tend to lean towards the ideological extremes of each party, candidates are forced to adopt extreme beliefs to navigate the primary process, and consequently struggle to appeal to the center after winning the nomination. The presence of Cruz will exacerbate this problem; his conservative viewpoints, combined with his national prominence and famously outspoken nature, will undoubtedly force the other candidates farther to the right.
It is difficult to believe that the Republican Party will win a presidential election in the near future when Tea Party candidates like Ted Cruz—whose announcement speech included numerous religious references and alluded to repealing the Affordable Care Act and eliminating the Internal Revenue Service—run in the primaries and pull the eventual nominee into supporting more ideologically extreme platforms. In short, Cruz’s candidacy will not be positive for either party: His brand of politics exemplifies the extremism that has plagued both the Republican Party and Capitol Hill in recent years.

“Who here wrote a thesis?” Conan C. O'Brien ’85 asked the Class of 2000 during his Class Day address. “A lot of hard work, a lot of your blood went into that thesis,” he said. “And no one is ever going to care.”
But every once in awhile, people in the real world do care. Take Mark J. Chiusano ’12, a former FM Chair. His thesis, “Marine Park: Stories,” consisted of short stories about the Brooklyn neighborhood  in which he grew up. In 2014, Penguin Books published Marine Park to critical acclaim. “[A] promising debut collection,” wrote Publishers Weekly. “Absolute genius,” wrote The Boston Herald.
Chiusano adds to a history of Harvard graduates whose theses influenced the outside world. In the spirit of thesis season, FM investigates some notable cases in that history.
Leonard Bernstein ’39 wrote a thesis titled "The Absorption of Race Elements into American Music." Bernstein wrote, "I wonder what critics in 1975 will have to say on a young American composer of 1938!" in pencil on the back of one of his thesis pages. Bernstein would have been pleased to know that many critics in 1975 considered him the preeminent American composer of the mid twentieth century for works like West Side Story. Bernstein published his thesis in Findings, a 1982 book containing essays and other writings.
In John F. Kennedy’s ’40 thesis, “Appeasement at Munich,” Kennedy wrote, “In this day when the decisions are those of whether it will be peace or war the fundamental instinct of man against war, exert a decisive influence on democracies’ representatives.” Kennedy’s work received magna cum laude honors, but comments from professors were critical. One professor wrote, “Fundamental premise never analyzed. Much too long, wordy, repetitious….Yet thesis shows real interest and reasonable amount of work….Many typographical errors.” Another professor called the thesis “badly written.” Nevertheless, Kennedy published his thesis under the title “Why England Slept” the same year he graduated. The book sold eighty thousand copies in the United States and England. Kennedy earned $40,000 in royalties. JFK’s connection to his father, Joseph P. Kennedy ’12, the United States Ambassador to Great Britain at the time, was a primary reason for the book’s success.
Even for those who do not publish, a thesis’ themes often resonate throughout the graduate’s career. Henry A. Kissinger’s ’50 thesis, “The Meaning of History: Reflections on Spengler, Toynbee and Kant,” spanned 388 pages. In response, the Government Department instituted a 120 page limit on senior theses. Kissinger’s attention to statesmanship and philosophy, not to mention his long windedness, continued throughout his career. Ben S. Bernanke ’75, Chairman of the Federal Reserve from 2006 to 2014, wrote an economics thesis titled “An Integrated Model for Energy Policy” in which he advocated the deregulation of the natural gas industry. “I would say that the government pretty much followed our recommendation,” said Dale W. Jorgenson, Bernanke’s thesis advisor and a current member of the economics faculty.
Sheryl K. Sandberg ’91, Facebook Chief Operating Officer, wrote a thesis that garnered top honors titled “How Economic Inequality Contributes to Spousal Abuse.” The thesis, which Lawrence H. Summers oversaw as thesis advisor, investigated marriage dynamics through the lens of behavioral economics. Sandberg’s 2013 book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, and her advocacy encouraging women to take leadership roles relate to her thesis’ theme of gender dynamics.
More recently, Anna K. Barnett-Hart’s ’09 thesis, “The Story of the CDO Market Meltdown: An Empirical Analysis,” exposed root causes of the 2008 financial crisis. The thesis inspired Michael Lewis to write The Big Short, a 2010 book. In the acknowledgments section, Lewis wrote, “[Barnett-Hart’s thesis] remains more interesting than any single piece of Wall Street research on the subject.”
The majority of theses do not receive this level of outside recognition. Yet, fortunately for seniors, Conan O’Brien suggests a use for their hard-earned products. “For three years after graduation I kept my thesis in the glove compartment of my car so I could show it to a policeman in case I was pulled over,” he said on Class Day. “License, registration, cultural exploration of the Man Child in the Sound and the Fury.” O’Brien, a former History and Literature concentrator, wrote a thesis titled “The ‘Old Child’ in Faulkner and O’Connor.” He is now a comedian.

Sandrine’s Bistro will close its doors on March 30, according to co-managing partner Gwen B. Trost. The French bistro, which was headed by award-winning chef Raymond E. Ost until August, has been a part of Harvard Square since 1996.
Trost said that the restaurant had experienced a tough economic winter due to the harsh weather but stated the decision to close had been made before the snow storms had arrived.
“[The weather] didn’t help certainly, but we had reached a decision prior to the hard winter,” Trost said.
Trost instead cited Sandrine’s long tenure along with the many changes in Harvard Square as the cause for closing.
“After 18 years with all the changes in the Square, it was just time to move on and do different things,” said Trost.
A lease has been signed by a new restaurant to take Sandrine’s place, according to Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association. However, the new owners have not decided on the details, including type of food to be served.
Restaurant management company Classic Restaurant Concepts will replace Sandrine’s with an high-end restaurant that will open by May, in time for Harvard’s Commencement, according to The Boston Globe. Classic Restaurant Concepts, which manages two Irish pubs in the Boston area, is in the process of selecting a chef to head the new restaurant.

Former member of Congress Gabrielle Giffords and her spouse Mark Kelly will deliver remarks as this year’s Harvard Law School Class Day speakers, the school announced on Tuesday. The couple will speak on May 27.
Giffords served in the United States House of Representatives from 2007 until her resignation in 2012, representing Arizona’s 8th District.
In 2011, Giffords survived an assassination attempt when she was shot in the head while having a public meeting near Tucson. Six people were killed and 13 were injured in the attack. The event and Gifford’s subsequent recovery process thrust her and her husband into the national spotlight. After several months, some of which she spent in a coma, Giffords returned to the House, but resigned soon afterwards to finish her recovery.
Her husband, Mark Kelly, is an Astronaut for NASA, naval aviator, and author. He flew on the Space Shuttle Endeavor  in 2011.
Following her career in Congress, Giffords became an outspoken advocate for gun legislation. She created a political action committee Americans for Responsible Solutions, which focuses on reducing gun violence.
Deval L. Patrick ’78, former Massachusetts governor, will be this year’s Commencement speaker.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Allston residents who have long awaited a commuter rail station in their neighborhood said they felt frustrated after revelations earlier this month that a deal to secure the final $8.33 million needed for the “West Station” project from Boston University was never finalized.
Plans for West Station, which would connect Allston to the existing Framingham/Worcester line that originates at South Station, were received with cautious optimism when they were announced last September. Harvard and the state had each agreed then to cover one third of the $25 million project cost, but the Massachusetts Department of Transportation Authority was unable to secure the commitment of a third party to cover the rest of the project.
A letter obtained by the Boston Globe from BU President Robert A. Brown stated that the university was “prepared to help fund the construction of West Station” pending further discussion and an agreement that would prevent cars and buses from using the university’s West Campus to reach the station. Those discussions and the funding from BU were, according to university spokesperson Colin D. Riley, never finalized.
Residents expressed disappointment at the lack of transparency in the state’s discussions, at being excluded from the conversation, and at BU’s silence at Allston I-90 Interchange Task Force meetings. The task force is a public forum for community discussion on the realignment of the Massachusetts turnpike and the West Station project.
“At the task force meeting there was zero discussion…. BU didn’t pipe up once, bring any issues to the table, or discuss their concerns,” said task force member Galen M. Mook. “[If] they’re going to pretend to participate, then the stonewalling and hiding of their intentions doesn’t show good faith that they’re engaging the community.”
Allston resident Richard Parr ’01, while still frustrated, said he was more willing to understand BU’s failure to include Allston residents in its alleged discussion of the details of the West Station project.
“It’s understandable because [BU and Harvard] are putting the money down, but this seems to go beyond that,” Parr said.
As for BU’s condition prohibiting vehicles from reaching the commuter rail station via its west campus, task force member Matthew Danish said that “having the ability to have buses go from West Station to Boston is really important.” He added that conditioning funding could severely inhibit West Station’s growth as a bus station.
Many residents also expressed hopes that future discussions between Harvard, BU, and the MBTA would be more public and transparent.
In an unpublished letter to The Globe shared with The Crimson, Allston resident Brent C. Whelan ’73 wrote that the community has “a historic opportunity to reconnect the sundered halves of Allston, build a fully accessible new transit hub, and alleviate some of the worst traffic congestion in the region.”
In the letter, Whelan asked for an end to what he characterized as BU’s “secret negotiation[s]” for its own “parochial” interests and called on the university “to join the civic team.”
BU alum and task force member Paola M. Ferrer said that she found the university’s conditional cooperation “foolish” and “paternalistic,” characterizing its behavior as “border[ing] on NIMBYism," using an acronym for "not in my backyard."
“I’m still in a little bit of disbelief,” Ferrer concluded. “I came to love this city being a student at BU, but I find—now being a long term resident and a homeowner in the community—the lack of transparency really insulting and disappointing.”

The International Collegiate Science Journal, a collaborative publication bringing together material from multiple schools, released its inaugural issue this March after more than a year of preparation.
Formed cooperatively by representatives from several undergraduate science journals, including the Harvard Science Review, the first issue of the ICSJ features material from nine different publications in online and print versions, which will be distributed on Harvard’s campus Wednesday.
Alexandra E. Rojek ’15, former co-president of the Harvard Science Review and one of the ICSJ co-founders, said the project aims to bring science to a wider audience.
“If you have some incredible finding you have to be good at communicating it – [but] not only for a very technical science article,” she said. “For that science to actually have a real impact you have to be able to communicate with people that aren’t involved in that field.”
Stephen Y. Cognetta, a senior at Princeton University and another co-founder of the ICSJ, said science is too often seen as limited to specialists.
“[We] imagine people tinkering in a lab in a basement… with things that we don’t really care about,” he said. “These are the people that are curing cancer or inventing new technologies, and it’s sad that we don’t care about them.”
Cognetta said he started emailing leaders of several other undergraduate science journals in January 2014 about the potential for a collaborative project.
“At first I didn’t have a clear plan—just a group that would talk together and figure out what we could do,” he said.
The students, communicating over email or in monthly video chats, decided to create a joint publication highlighting the best material from each of their respective journals.
According to Rojek, the ICSJ currently has a non-hierarchical leadership structure.
“We don’t have an editor-in-chief or any [other] formal titles,” she said. “[We] kind of all found our own roles.”
Princeton representatives spearheaded a successful Kickstarter campaign for the publication last spring, Rice University’s team helped lead the design process, and Rojek coordinated the editing process over the summer.
While the lack of a hierarchy permitted each school’s publication to bring their strengths to the publication, at times it made the process more difficult, said Julia Zhao, a senior at Rice.
However, a constitution that is currently in the final stages of approval by the member schools will bring a more formal structure with an editor-in-chief, director of design, and other specific roles to the organization next year, she said.
Several members of the ICSJ said that next steps for the organization include incorporating other schools into the ICSJ.
“I want every university to have a science journal that is in the ICSJ,” said Cognetta.

University President Drew G. Faust will convene a panel about climate change on April 13, following several requests on behalf of a faculty group calling for an open forum about Harvard’s investment in fossil fuel companies.
The panel will be moderated by talk show host and journalist Charlie Rose, who has interviewed Faust on television in the past. The roster of panelists is scheduled to include Harvard science and public policy professors as well as experts from outside the University.
Faust’s announcement comes after several efforts on behalf of Harvard Faculty for Divestment—a group of 238 faculty from across the University who have signed an open letter urging Faust to withdraw its investments in fossil fuel companies— to schedule an open forum to discuss the University’s stance on divestment. In the past year, members of the Harvard Faculty for Divestment have repeatedly asked for an “open forum in which members of the Corporation, students, faculty, and alumni speak.”
Student activist group Divest Harvard—founded in 2012—has also repeatedly asked for an open meeting with Faust to discuss the issue.
The climate panel is scheduled to fall on the first day of a week-long sit in organized by Divest Harvard and University alumni called “Harvard Heat Week,” in which protestors will demand that the University divest from the fossil fuel industry. History of Science professor Naomi Oreskes, a member of Harvard Faculty for Divestment, is scheduled to speak on the panel.
Harvard Faculty for Divestment, for its part, has scheduled what they call a “Faculty Forum on Divestment” for April 17, the same week as Faust’s forum, according to the group’s website.
James G. Anderson, a member of Harvard Faculty for Divestment, praised Faust’s efforts to create what he called a “spectacular” panel.
“She’s done a brilliant job of finding contributors for the panel,” Anderson said. “It’s a very important step forward.”
However, Anderson said he still would like to see a forum focused specifically on the University's stance on divestment.
For his part, Medical School assistant professor James M. Recht, one of the four principal authors of Harvard Faculty for Divestment’s open letter urging divestment, said Faust’s climate forum was not enough.
“We have asked the University to provide an open forum on fossil fuel divestment, so they certainly haven't done that,” Recht said, noting that divestment is not explicitly mentioned as a topic for the panel. He added, however, that Oreskes’s participation in the panel is “encouraging.”
Divest Harvard founder Chloe S. Maxmin ’15 said that although “important voices” will contribute to the panel, the forum is not the open discussion about fossil fuel divestment that Divest Harvard has requested in the past.
“The administration has still rejected having open dialogue about fossil fuel divestment,” Maxmin said, adding that she hopes divestment will be discussed in some capacity at the event.
Environmental activist William E. McKibben '82, a former Crimson president, was skeptical of Faust's forum.
"I think it's appropriate that they've bought in one of the best talk show hosts in America, because what Harvard likes to do about this problem is...talk," McKibben wrote in an email. "But it's time that they acted as well, and joined folks like, say, the Rockefeller family in divesting from fossil fuels. After a certain point, talk begins to curdle."
Faust recently returned from a trip to China, where she met with Chinese President Xi Jinping to discuss efforts to combat climate change and spoke at Beijing’s Tsinghua University about research and universities’ role in fighting climate change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 25, 2015, at 4:13 a.m.
In an open forum organized by the Undergraduate Council with University President Drew G. Faust and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana on Tuesday, undergraduates focused their questions on funding opportunities for jobs and internships in public service, accessibility of the upperclassman Houses, and inclusivity of campus social spaces.
Several students asked Khurana and Faust about perceived hurdles they see in pursuing an internship in public service, including a summer earnings contribution expectation from the financial aid office.
“We’re very aware, as we try to enhance the opportunities for public service, of [the summer contribution] constraint and of the barrier it can pose for students who are on financial aid,” Faust said. “But I think we would like to choose to address it by resolving that barrier rather than by changing our financial aid program.”
Faust promoted the University’s presidential public service fellowship program and hinted at a new initiative that could be funded by an alumnus considering a “significant gift” directed to public service.
Kunho Kim ’17 and Brad I. Riew ’17 raised a question at the forum about inaccessibility on Harvard’s campus, which Faust regarded as at times “antique” and “inhospitable.”
Specifically, Kim and Riew expressed their concern and frustration that only four out of 12 upperclassman dining halls are fully accessible to disabled students. While students can request location changes when met with unaccessible venues, this is tedious and unrealistic, Kim and Riew said.
“It’s hard to [take ownership of spaces] when you can’t enter the spaces,” Riew said. “We understand that the University is admirably trying to do House renovations that will make the College more accessible, but that’s a process that will take place over many years.”
In response, Faust personally invited Kim, Riew, and all other students concerned about accessibility to her office to discuss strategies towards making the campus more accessible on a short-term basis.
Khurana personally apologized to the students, and expressed his belief that all campus spaces should feel accessible, as opposed to “cornered off.”
“We’ll do our best to make sure that you never have to feel that way, or that anyone feels that way,” Khurana said. “Everybody on this campus belongs here, and should feel like this is their place.”
Undergraduate Council representatives William Oh ’18 and Happy Yang ’16, who also attended the forum, suggested the idea of allocating space in the Smith Campus Center for various student organizations, such as the Women's Center and Office of BGLTQ Student Life.
Oh said that the current basement locations for these organizations are “inaccessible, at least symbolically.”
Council representative Shaiba Rather ’17 raised a concern that the campus center would not serve as an appropriate social space for undergraduates. As currently planned, the center will accommodate all students, staff, and faculty at the University.
Khurana pointed to common spaces within the Houses as more viable social hubs for students at the College, while Faust said she expects primarily undergraduates to use the campus center after 8 p.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A billboard in front of Cambridge City Hall asks: How would you spend $500,000 to improve the city?
From March 22 to 28, Cambridge residents 12 and up will be able to vote on projects proposed by residents for city improvements. For its first participatory budget, the city will set aside $500,000 to fund one-time capital projects chosen from a pool of 20, which was whittled down from an original list of 380.
Potential projects include bike repair stations ($12,000), a Cambridge Garden of Peace ($340,000) and free wifi in six outdoor spaces ($42,000). Others ideas would create murals, amphitheatres, and even a dog park.
A “Toilet for All” ($320,000) could be installed in Central Square.
Voters can cast ballots in person or by phone. According to Michelle Monsegur, who works in the Cambridge Budget Department, Harvard students are able to vote. So long as they live in Cambridge, they do not need to be from the area to vote, nor do they need to have a 617 area code. To vote online, all one needs is a phone that can receive texts.
“You don’t have to do the math, you don't have to rank them, you just have to pick your five favorites,” Monsegur said. “If you're going to be a part of this community for four years, why not voice [your] opinion about what you’d like to see in this town?”
While this is Cambridge’s first participatory budget, the Participatory Budget Project began in Brazil in 1989, and its programs have been implemented in 1,500 city budgets worldwide. The program aims to engage citizens in government; this is the first year it has come to Cambridge, which has seen 700 to 800 votes cast so far, according to Pam Jennings, who works with the Project.
At a project Expo in Windsor Street Health Center, dozens of Cambridge residents, many of them parents with children, toured a warmly lit room full of poster boards that explained the various proposals. Some featured origami; others, cut-out letters. All were colorful. Laptops in the corner of the room were available for voting, and volunteers roamed throughout the room to answer questions.
Kathy L. Watkins, who lives in West Cambridge, had a proposal that made the final cut. The proposal, Little Free Libraries (Book Exchanges) ($13,000), would place around the city 13 small waterproof containers, in which residents would be able to take and leave free books. Watkins was hopeful her project would be voted in, but said she was enthusiastic about all the projects that had been suggested.
“I’ve always wanted them to do [the Participatory Budget] here,” she said. “Sometimes I feel like I talk and talk and no one listens, this is a process that really brings the community together.”
The results will be announced in April, and winning projects will be implemented July and onwards. Currently, according to Monsegur, a more popular project has been Healthy Trees for a Healthy Cambridge! ($119,400).
“Word’s starting to spread pretty quickly,” Monsegur said. “What’s exciting people is that you have to be 12 to vote ... maybe that will encourage [the minors] as they grow older to vote in other elections. I think that’s exciting.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two Harvard Law School professors, Charles Fried and Robert H. Mnookin, sharply criticized the centralization of Harvard’s university governance structure and called for the creation of a faculty senate in an op-ed in the Chronicle of Higher Education published on Tuesday.
The op-ed, titled “The Silencing of Harvard’s Professors,” chronicles the growth of Harvard’s central administration from a once small group of a president and vice presidents to what they described as a now expansive “bureaucracy” of provosts and “a cadre of high-level of administrators.” While Fried and Mnookin acknowledged that the movement, dubbed “One Harvard,” “to some extent represents progress,” they argued that “the results have not always been good.”
“Today Harvard faces a serious governance problem that requires institutional change,” they wrote.
University President Drew G. Faust has described her vision for uniting Harvard as “One University,” through initiatives ranging from interdisciplinary programming to Harvard’s first truly University-wide capital campaign, which is ongoing and seeks to raise $6.5 billion across schools.
And last summer, in an unprecedented move, central administrators unveiled plans for Harvard’s first-ever University-wide policy and set of procedures to govern its handling of sexual harassment. Administrators lauded the change for bringing consistency to Harvard’s approach to the controversial issue across schools.
Law School professors did not react kindly to the change. A group of 28 professors blasted the newly centralized policy in an open letter in The Boston Globe last October, and Law School Dean Martha L. Minow charged a faculty committee with writing a new set of Title IX procedures for the Law School, departing from Harvard’s centralized framework.
Tuesday’s op-ed comes as the Law School moves to implement those new procedures, which will effectively bypass Harvard’s central Title IX investigation office.
Although they referenced the concept of “One Harvard” in their op-ed, the professors did not mention Faust by name in the piece.
In the piece, Fried and Mnookin argue that what they describe as Harvard’s ineffective governance structure has led to numerous problems, including the creation of Harvard’s central sexual harassment procedures, which they criticized, noting that no Law faculty sat on the committee that formed them. Law School faculty members met with Harvard’s general counsel to express their discontent with the procedures, threatening to publicly denounce them before the University allowed the Law School to create its own, according the op-ed.
Fried and Mnookin also cited recent controversy over changes to Harvard’s health benefits plan for non-union employees, which prompted push back from faculty and is currently under review.
To address these governance concerns, Fried and Mnookin called for the creation of a “representative” faculty senate to include ladder faculty from all University schools. Such a body would “provide the administration with an opportunity to have universitywide efforts discussed and assessed by a broadly representative group, not appointed by the central administration or particular deans,” they wrote.
In an emailed statement, University spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote that “Harvard deeply respects the important governance role that faculty necessarily play.”
Minow declined to comment.
This is not the first time that Harvard faculty members have criticized the University’s administrative structure or discussed the creation of a faculty senate. In 2013, following controversy over revelations that administrators at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences had secretly searched the email accounts of College resident deans in the wake of 2012’s Government 1310 cheating scandal, faculty raised governance concerns.
Fried, a former U.S. solicitor general, said he and Mnookin sent Faust, Minow, and others a “courtesy copy” of the op-ed before they submitted it to the Chronicle for publication. Fried and Mnookin both said they took issue with the headline published with the piece.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the first spring break in which two dining halls remained open as part of a pilot program announced last month, many students who remained on campus complained about overcrowding, although they said they were satisfied overall with the program.
The two dining halls, in Dunster and Currier House, served lunch and dinner during normal mealtimes for the duration of the break.
John K. Langat '17, who stayed on campus because he wanted to get through a backlog of schoolwork, noted that having the dining halls open was “convenient,” but also commented on the crowds in Dunster in particular.
“It was packed, mostly at 1-2 p.m. and 6-7 p.m,” Langat said. “Sometimes there was literally no space to sit in the dining hall. The best strategy was to either to go really early or really late.”
Another student, Jessica Xu '17, said she mostly noticed the crowd in the dining area of Dunster, where they were students sitting sometimes for an hour or more, but that the lines for food “weren’t too bad.”
Oreoluwa O. Babarinsa '15 noted that while the lines in Dunster were “somewhat long,” the dining hall was “clean and orderly” and “standard HUDS."
Students said Currier dining hall, located in the Radcliffe Quad, did not face the same type of crowds.
“It wasn’t deserted, but it wasn’t crowded either,” Taehwan Shin ’15 said.
Despite the complaints about the crowds in Dunster, all the students interviewed agreed that the pilot program was, on the whole, beneficial and should be continued.
“If there was another River dining hall open, it would probably would be better,” Theresa C. Rizk '17 said. “But the way it is now is better than not having it all. Otherwise you would have to buy food and that is not feasible for some people."
“It was really helpful,” Shin said. “It was really nice for international students like me who can’t go home due to distance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the series premiere of “The West Wing” (“Pilot”), President Josiah Bartlet ends the episode with a rousing speech to his core staff about a group of Cuban refugees who battled through a storm to claim asylum in Miami.
“Break’s over,” he says after a week of mishaps. They thank him and file out of the Oval Office. Standing at his desk, he bellows at his assistant, “Mrs. Landingham, what’s next?” giving rise to a phrase that will reappear time and time again throughout Aaron Sorkin and Thomas Schlamme’s television masterpiece.
“What’s next?” Bartlet asks in a flashback to early days with his campaign team after a third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses. Still unsure of all the names of these future staffers—soon to be his closest confidantes in office—he clarifies the question when they can’t quite answer to his satisfaction. “When I ask, ‘What’s next?’, it means that I’m ready to move on to other things. So, what’s next?”
Throughout the series, “what’s next” is asked by a plurality of the main characters in variety of contexts. The phrase comes to be a trope representative of the turning points, change, and evolution seen throughout Bartlet’s (yes, fictional, I know) terms in the White House.
No matter the obstacle, be it a shooting, an election, a kidnapping, a Congressional scandal, a debilitating illness (yes, these are all things you can look forward to in the series), Bartlet and his circle of quirky, mercurial, and brilliant staffers work past it. “What’s next?” There’s always something coming. Something smart. Something cunning. Something moral.
“What’s next?” is a question applicable far outside the land of Bartlet and Toby and C.J. and Sam and Josh and Leo. It’s one I asked myself after the end of the Harvard women’s ice hockey team’s loss to Minnesota, 4-1, in the title game of the NCAA tournament on Sunday afternoon in Minneapolis. It’s also the question I asked myself when head coach Katey Stone announced she’d take a leave from the team during the 2013-2014 season to coach the U.S.A. Olympic women’s hockey team. It’s the question I asked myself after a crushing double overtime loss to Yale in the first game of the ECAC tournament quarterfinals in 2014. It is, more or less, the question I regularly ask of Stone during press time after the games I cover, hovering in the lower level of the Bright-Landry Hockey Center with my recorder.
So, what is next? Well, for one, the departure of the class of 2015. Seniors Kalley Armstrong, Hillary Crowe, Sarah Edney, Lyndsey Fry, Marissa Gedman, Josephine Pucci, and Samantha Reber have suited up in Crimson for the last time. They’ve made tangible impacts upon the program and have been heavy producers for the team during their respective careers.
These graduations aren’t necessarily cause for concern. Turnover is a constant of collegiate athletics. For every star forward who departs for greener pastures, there’s a fresh-faced rookie waiting in the shadows. It’s just a matter of time. What’s next?
Sticking around is a cast of 19 other talented skaters and their decorated leader, Stone. Junior goalkeeper Emerance Maschmeyer—one of the most superlative between the pipes in the entire country—will return for a senior season. Four of the five leaders in points generated will be back, and back with a thirst at that.
This year, Stone’s 20th season at the helm of the Crimson, was nearly a storybook ending, with Beanpot, Ivy League, ECAC regular and tournament titles, and the team’s first Frozen Four appearance since 2008. The last time the team was this successful was in 2005, when Julie Chu ’07 and Sarah Vaillancourt ’09 were series regulars. Just like in 2005, perennial powerhouse Minnesota blemished the season’s finale—the NCAA title game—and left the team with a “what’s next?” moment, the proverbial cliffhanger. But here’s the thing about season finales: There’s a hiatus, a summer break, the writers regroup, guest stars are lined up, and it starts all over again.
At the close of the series finale of “The West Wing,” the next President—whose identity I won’t spoil for the sake of those who have yet to be enlightened—also asks, “What’s next?” as he begins his term in office. As the proverbial sun sets on the show, we flash to Bartlet aboard Air Force One with his wife, returning home to New Hampshire. She asks him what he’s thinking about. “Tomorrow,” he responds, simply and poetically. We are all left teary-eyed and nostalgic, wishing that Martin Sheen had actually been our President.
Fortunately, for Harvard and its women’s ice hockey team, Stone is head coach, and there’s a tomorrow—and what looks to be a bright one at that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
How do you prevent a bad ending from ruining everything else? How do you remember a season for what it was rather than how it concluded?
These are not rhetorical questions. I really don’t have answers.
I hoped co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi might, for his sake and mine. Talking in hushed tones in the Harvard men’s basketball locker room after the season-ending 67-65 loss to North Carolina last Thursday, I asked him:
How long will the sting of this loss blot out all the highs of this season—a fifth straight Ivy championship, a Defensive Player of the Year Award, a thrilling win over your archrival in an Ivy Playoff Game? How long will it take before you can look at all of that in proportion rather than just thinking about what just happened?
“Forever, maybe,” Moundou-Missi responded. “Who knows?”
That can’t be right, can it?
Entering a losing locker room in the NCAA Tournament feels like walking into a painting. Players known for their movement are deathly still. A team that has learned to communicate so well is absolutely silent. It feels like the kind of place where the word somber was invented.
The players sit in a near-perfect circle, slouched in their chairs or curled into their wooden lockers, heads cast either up or down, eyes red and puffy.
From a young age, basketball players are drilled to not linger on the past. “Next play, next game” coaches repeat incessantly.
But what about when there are no more nexts?
The easy thing to do would be to shift that one-play-at-a-time mentality to thinking about the last play, that three by senior wing Wesley Saunders that bounced off the backboard and caught the wrong part of the rim.
“It looked like it was going in,” senior Jonah Travis said after the game. “From my view, it looked pretty good.”
Travis did not dwell on the miss at the time. His sole thought when the ball hung in the air?
“Go get the damn rebound,” he said.
But then what?
It would be so much better for the players if they could just skip back a couple plays and dwell on a better one, like junior co-captain Siyani Chamber’s and-one three that put Harvard ahead of UNC with a minute to play, a string of words that would have seemed unfathomable a few years ago.
Chambers taking on of the country’s best point guards one-on-one after Saunders tapped him an offensive rebound? Him going around a screen, pulling up, and burying the shot?
Saunders pumping his fist, Moundou-Missi sprinting to Chambers, sophomore Zena Edosomwan and freshman Andre Chatfield going crazy on the bench with flexes and three-point goggles?
That moment would be more representative of this team’s season.
This season, that started with a win against MIT and then a loss to Holy Cross. This team, that was ranked in the top 25 preseason but lost back-to-back games to nonconference opponents for just the second time since 2008; that took a one-game lead in the Ivy race, lost it, watched Yale squander its chance to clinch the conference championship in its final regular season game at Dartmouth, and then sent the Bulldogs home with a game-winning shot in a rare Ivy Playoff game; that never dominated but also never quit; that went 5-1 in one-possession games before facing UNC.
And Harvard battled against the Tar Heels, chipping away a 16-point deficit until Chambers gave his team its proverbial One Shining Moment.
“I think one thing we learned about this team is that we are fighters,” Moundou-Missi said. “No matter how tough the situation is, we can figure out a way to somehow get out of it.”
But there just wasn’t time to battle back once more after Justin Jackson made a jumper to tie the game and dunked to take the lead in the closing seconds Thursday.
Afterwards, though, a team cannot celebrate its fight. There is only win or loss, and postgame locker room scenes are equally binary in the NCAA Tournament.
This is the fault of the coach’s mantra. Next-play theory requires that the thrill of Chambers’ three must be forgotten before the ensuing inbounds pass is thrown. Meanwhile, the last feeling in a game seeps outside the moment, lingering with nothing to succeed it. Sitting behind the podium during the post game press conference, Saunders could not smile about the 26 points he scored. He could only cry about the three points he did not.
The same holds over the course of a season. Monumental wins like Harvard’s at Yale or against Yale in the Playoff are magical in the moment but then are immediately relegated to ‘part of the journey.’ And in a sport set up so that all but one of the country’s most successful teams end their years with a loss, that journey is almost guaranteed to end in disappointment, casting a shadow over all of the steps taken along the way.
But this is not just a basketball problem. It’s an everyone problem. We are all terrible at handling ends. In our minds, moments always lose out to results—in classes, in relationships, in any pursuit, really. Pre-terminal moments only get their due in regards to vacations, obituaries, and long-running television shows. Otherwise, in bundling all the memories together, we actually stack them, with the last one glued to the top.
Reflecting on his season, Moundou-Missi said, “This year especially was a roller coaster,” adding, “but that’s what makes it fun. It makes it exciting. We live for those moments.”
But what happens when those moments stop?
Before leaving the locker room so that the players could reflect—or at least try to—in peace, I talked to Travis. A smart guy whose biggest contribution to this Crimson team has been his unending motor and never-quit attitude, maybe he would have an answer to my question.
How long does it take to see more than just this loss when you think about this season, I asked.
“I honestly have no idea,” Travis said.
“I guess we’ll see,” he added, his voice shaking slightly.

On March 19, President Drew G. Faust sent an email that most likely was sent to our spam folders, if not automatically, then manually after reading the subject line. However, we at Flyby read the email, and have dissected the message about this truly “historic moment” that impacts our entire community.
“It’s official. We have endured the snowiest winter on record, shoveling and trudging our way into history.”
I guess I can now tell my future grandchildren that the Winter of ’15 was officially the harshest of all time. I also now know that I trudged my way into history, although some could argue that it was much harder snapchatting our way into the campus story.
“I write now to invite you to join friends and colleagues on the Science Center Plaza…”
So, is this my invitation to freshman formal? The Class of 2017 offers the freshmen a heartfelt apology for this change in scenery, by the way.
“…on Thursday, March 26, from 3:00 to 5:00 p.m., for a celebration of this historic moment.”
THURSDAY?! Out of all the days of the week, it had to be on the one where I schedule my pset dates at Lamont. Oh, why Faust? Why?
“Please stop by to enjoy some well-deserved hot chocolate and s’mores…”
Ahhh, you should’ve made this the subject line of the email! I assure you the email opening rate would have increased had this been done. Although this sounds like the Harvard Oasis version of…winter, I guess.
“…as we look forward to what I hope will be an especially beautiful spring.”
Right there with you on that, Drew.

The quick and dirty about what's been going on around the Ancient Eight (and other schools too).
With spring -- it may not seem like it, but yes, last Friday marked the official first day of spring -- comes spring cleaning. And around the Ivies there has been some cleansing going on.
In January, Dartmouth President Phil Hanlon announced that the school would become more “academically rigorous.” In a panel held a few weeks ago, faculty members noted concern that students were able to engage in “high risk” drinking during the week “given the stresses of the academic calendar.” The spring term will mark the beginning of the hard alcohol ban at Dartmouth, and faculty members also support moving classes earlier, apparently so that students will not be able to stay out as late at their Greek houses. Not sure what moving classes earlier will do, but the alcohol ban might have some consequences -- students will be suspended for a whole term for just two offenses. Yikes. A professor expressed hope that these changes will encourage Greeks to return to the practices of the 1850s, where fraternities held debates rather than “late night drinking parties.” ... We’ll see.
Brown and Columbia continue to face controversy around administrative policies relating to sexual assault, in light of recent events. After the school’s charges were dropped against a student accused of sexual assault by a female student reportedly drugged with the date rape drug GHB at a Phi Kappa Psi fraternity party, Brown community members criticized the university, believing that the charges were wrongfully dropped because the accused was the son of a Corporation trustee. Students organized protests, and voiced their opinions on social media through hashtags like #MoneyTalksAtBrown and #GHBGetOutofRapeFree.
450 Columbia graduate students protested the university’s newly created sexual respect education program that all undergraduates and graduate students will be required to complete in order to graduate, by sending in a “letter of noncompliance” to administration.
Meanwhile, at Yale, there’s been some literal cleaning… sixty-nine dorm room had to be repainted because of dangerous levels of exposed lead. The issue was brought to the attention of school authorities by a student living in one of the hazardous rooms. Oops. Once again, we’re glad we’re not there.

Maybe it was just me (aka it was definitely just me), but when I got that CEB email today with the subject “Your Yardfest Artist is…” and then “noon.” in the biggest and coolest font, I looked up “noon band,” and was directed to a Facebook band page with 155 likes. What, not even a legit band with a Myspace page? But then I realized that noon referred to the time. THIS YEAR’S YARDFEST ARTIST WILL BE ANNOUNCED TODAY AT NOON AND HOPEFULLY THAT DOESN’T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE RANDOM BAND I FOUND!
I have been taking bets on this year’s big artist and I’m not about to lose, so you saw it here first.
Here’s my top five most likely to come through*.
1) Nicki Minaj2) Lil Wayne3) Drake4) Beyoncé5) Jay-Z
For real though, at 12:00 p.m./midday/noon/whatever is least confusing for you, WE WILL KNOW WHO WILL BE AT YARDFEST. Keep checking up here to see if anyone can beat Janelle Monae.
*If I am incorrect, I will have my own personal concert after Yardfest, during which I will Only Truffle Butter with a little Love On Top.
