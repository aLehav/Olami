After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s no surer sign that Zayn Malik has left One Direction for good than the fact that his newest release—an atmospheric take on electro-R&B that makes full and explicit reference to “be[ing] in the bed all day” and “piss[ing] off the neighbors” with what one would presume contextually to be loud sex—is titled “Pillowtalk.” The single, Malik’s first since signing as a solo artist with RCA, presents a complete transformation for the former boyband member, who had previously spoken of feeling constrained by One Direction’s tightly controlled, carefully clean-cut image. Now free from the restrictions against which he had so bristled during his time with the group, Malik escapes the creative stagnation of being in a band marketed to young girls to prove himself a vocal powerhouse and a bona fide musician.
Even while in One Direction, Malik often lost the spotlight to ladies’ man Harry Styles and his other more outgoing bandmates; being the most vocally competent member of a boy band appeared to garner him neither the attention of critics nor the loudest of fangirl screams. Rather, it is “Pillowtalk,” unveiling in solo format the same pipes responsible for the impressive ad-libs in One Direction hits “Best Song Ever” and “You & I,” that finally seems to have communicated to the public that he is, in fact, a good singer. Malik’s voice is a lovely one that has matured in the years since he’s risen to fame, at last smooth and agile enough to suit the R&B he’s always wanted to sing (he auditioned at age 17 for “The X Factor,” where he became a part of One Direction, with a somewhat lackluster version of Mario’s “Let Me Love You”), and “Pillowtalk” showcases his range and technique to full effect.
Beyond serving as a successful vehicle for Malik’s new sound, the single is a good—albeit not great—song in its own right. A The Weeknd-ish amalgam of low, buzzing synth and dripping, hypnotic beats, with an opening riff vaguely reminiscent of Nicki Minaj’s “Super Bass,” “Pillowtalk” makes no pretense at innovation, no forays into uncharted musical territory. Instead it accomplishes precisely what it sets out to do: It establishes Malik as a soloist by casting aside his tweenybopper-friendly image to appeal to a wider audience. Inoffensive but not insipid, commercial but not clichéd, the track has already landed Malik at the top of the U.K. charts a week after its release. “Everybody has sex, and it’s something people wanna hear about,” he said of the single in an interview with The Sunday Times; and it would seem that when Zayn Malik is the one doing the talking (or rather the singing), “Pillowtalk” is indeed something that people want to hear.
“Mind of Mine” is out on March 25 via RCA Records.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Smoking marijuana with rapper Ice Cube on national television is not a typical resume item for guests invited to speak with University President Drew G. Faust in a packed Sanders Theatre, but Conan C. O’Brien ’85 is not your typical Harvard alumnus.

During an afternoon advertised as a “wide-ranging conversation about arts and education,” Faust asked O’Brien what the humanities had done for his career, and the late-night legend responded in turn—but not without sarcasm.
“Absolutely nothing. You should’ve asked me before I came here,” he joked.
Over the next hour and a half, the former Mather House resident captivated hundreds of students with his sometimes honest and sometimes absurd takes on Harvard culture and success in comedy. He discussed how his Harvard years impacted his turbulent, decades-long reign over late night comedy and the unique value of a liberal arts education.
“College is when you should actually get about as lost as you can get in terms of expanding what it is you want to know, what it is you think you know and don’t know, go places, think about things you would not normally think about,” O’Brien, who graduated magna cum laude with a degree in History and Literature, said. “You do not get this opportunity again.”
O’Brien acknowledged he was nervous to return to his alma mater, saying he was particularly tormented by senior thesis flashbacks. After Faust said the event with O’Brien had taken a year to plan, O’Brien pretended to imitate an inebriated Faust slurring a plea for the comedian to speak at Harvard, drawing laughter from the audience.
“When I met President Faust in that seedy bar a year ago, she was like ‘you gotta do it,’” he joked.“I was like, ‘President Faust, please, it’s one in the afternoon.’”
But between wisecracks, the Brookline, Mass. native became serious, revealing his anxiety about his experience with Harvard’s moneyed milieu (“You could literally go to Eliot House and everyone was wearing a bow tie and had a falcon on their arm,” he quipped) and the misconception that someone like him—a prominent comedian—had found the key to success in life.
“It’s an illusion that people in my situation have figured something out,” he said. “It’s a constant struggle—you’re insecure in the morning and you feel better about yourself at night, and sometimes that switches.”
A two-term president of the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, O’Brien said he developed his sense of humor as a “defense mechanism” to diffuse unpleasant situations.
“You’re making your living off something that should probably be treated,” O’Brien said, recalling something his father had said to him about his career in comedy.
While O’Brien continually affirmed the value of the education he received at Harvard, he said in an interview after the public event that the stigma attached to Harvard’s name sometimes posed problems to his career. He told The Crimson that he sometimes worried about being “pre-judged” because of the Harvard name and would occasionally intentionally play down his connection to the school.
“So in the comedy world, Harvard didn’t only not help, there were times when I felt like it hindered,” O’Brien said. “The Lampoon connection obviously helped. I made a lot of great friends, and it changed my life, and it helped me get into comedy.”
After half an hour of conversation, Faust and O’Brien opened the floor to audience questions. Asked about his greatest regret at Harvard, O’Brien said he wished he had not been too intimidated to take Economics 10: “Principles of Economics.”
“That was knowledge that I don’t have, and I’ve always regretted it,” he said before mocking a few audience members who had cheered at the mention of the class. “What a nerd sanctuary in here.”
Betty Anne Richardson ’17, a Crimson executive, requested that O’Brien “dab” onstage, eventually demonstrating the dance move for the bewildered comedian until he reluctantly acquiesced.
“So basically I’m your monkey right now. I’m your trained chimp. Will this bring you a small bit of joy?” O’Brien said. He then performed the move.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 13, 2016, at 6:52 p.m.
Harvard men’s hockey co-captain Jimmy Vesey has been ruled out of tonight’s contest against Union with an undisclosed lower body injury.
Vesey skated with the team prior to the game on Saturday but was left out of the lineup as a precautionary measure, according to Assistant Director of Athletic Communications Brock Malone. Vesey picked up the injury on Friday, when he registered 13 shots on goal in a 2-1 loss to No. 18/- RPI.
Vesey, one of the frontrunners for the Hobey Baker award—given to college hockey’s Most Valuable Player—leads the No. 9/9 Crimson (13-8-3, 9-5-3 ECAC) in scoring with 18 goals and 35 points through 24 games. The Nashville Predators prospect has also been nominated for the Walter Brown award, which Vesey earned last season for being deemed the top American-born college hockey player in New England.
With Vesey missing his first game since Feb. 15, 2013, freshman Ryan Donato will assume the senior's spot on the first line alongside co-captain Kyle Criscuolo and junior center Alexander Kerfoot. Meanwhile, junior forward Luke Esposito will move up to the second line, where he’ll be joined by junior Sean Malone and senior Colin Blackwell.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Prior to Saturday night’s matchup between Harvard and Yale at Lavietes Pavilion, a Bulldogs beat reporter tweeted about the amount of championship banners—16 in total— hanging from the arena’s rafters.
The next two hours illustrated the difference between the teams that made the rafters and the team that took the court, as Yale handed Harvard its third straight loss at home. After a spirited effort from the hosts (10-14, 2-6 Ivy League) to keep the score close early, Yale (16-5, 8-0) led by double figures for the last 21 minutes of action in a 67-55 win. Yale’s third consecutive victory in Cambridge is a first in the Tommy Amaker era.
“They’re definitely a team right now that has great momentum going and you can’t deny that they are playing very great basketball,” junior forward Zena Edosomwan said. “They look very confident on the court, they look very together.”
The Bulldogs took charge of the game late in the first half behind its two stars—senior forward Justin Sears and sophomore point guard Makai Mason. While Harvard had success early on with senior Agunwa Okolie guarding Mason, it was forced to move over freshman Tommy McCarthy after Okolie picked up his second foul with 7:40 remaining.
From that point forward, Harvard’s defense cratered. Yale had 19 points in the remainder of the half, 15 from Sears and Mason. Their counterparts—McCarthy and junior forward Zena Edosomwan—shot just four for 14 in the first half. Edosomwan started the game with a jumper and two blocks of Sears but missed seven of his next eight shots.
“We go to him a lot and we need to be more efficient with the outcome of what we are getting when we go to him so much,” Amaker said.
Coming out of halftime, the Bulldogs did not let up. Despite the negligible contributions of senior Brandon Sherrod—whose six points were 12 less than his average in conference play—Yale used precise passing to cut through a typically stingy Harvard defense and get layup after layup. After missing its first two layups of the second period, Yale came away with points on five of the next six possessions.
The last three scores followed a quick 5-1 Harvard run and pushed the lead to 14 with 14 minutes remaining. The Crimson cut the lead to 11, but was unable to get it down further. When Mason and Sears hit the bench midway through the second period, Yale’s supporting cast pushed the lead from 11 to 17.
“There’s no hiding from our struggles this year, especially in Ivy League play,” Edosowman said. “None of obviously expected to be kind of at this point.”
Yale’s defense was the story in the second half. While Edosomwan caught fire late and finished with 18 points and 14 rebounds, Harvard shot just 40 percent overall and made just four of 16 three-point attempts, with freshman sharpshooter Corey Johnson being the only Harvard player to nail a triple.
After shooting 36 percent in the first 12 minutes of the second period, Harvard found a brief burst of offense late by going to Edosomwan on every possession. The resulting 7-0 run kept Yale’s starters on the floor but never threatened the lead as Harvard’s inability to capitalize on Yale’s mistakes hurt it time and time again. For the game, the Crimson turned 10 offensive rebounds into just five second chance points and had just five points off Yale’s eight turnovers.
Afterwards, Amaker talked about the unfamiliarity of the situation for the Crimson—who sit six games back of Yale at the bottom of the Ancient Eight standings.
“This is new for our team and our program at this stage,” Amaker said. “… There’s a lot that can be learned and taken away from these types of moments and we are hopeful that we will maximize that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

It’s not easy replacing co-captain Jimmy Vesey—unless you’re Ryan Donato. Then it comes with a hat trick.
Skating without their injured star, the No. 9/9 Harvard men’s hockey team (14-8-3, 10-5-3 ECAC) snapped a three-game losing streak behind Donato’s three goals to beat Union, 4-1, Saturday night.
After sustaining a lower body injury in a 2-1 loss to RPI on Friday, Vesey watched Saturday night’s game from the stands, opening a spot for the freshman Donato on the Crimson’s first line against the Dutchmen (11-11-8, 4-9-5). Yet at times, Vesey’s surrogate might have fooled the crowd at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center into thinking that the Hobey Baker finalist was back on the ice.
On the power play with under 10 seconds left in the second period, Donato collected the puck near the end boards before finding a seam along the low slot. The freshman won a footrace across the crease and jammed the puck past the right pad of Union goaltender Alex Sakellaropoulos to give Harvard a 3-0 lead. The move, for all intents and purposes, was Vesey-esque.
“I see Jimmy do the same thing every day, so I knew what I wanted to do,” Donato laughed. “So thank you to him for helping me with that one.”
The second period goal was, by far, the flashiest of Donato’s efforts Saturday—his first period goal came on a deflection and his third period goal was an empty-netter—but style points do not count in the conference standings. With the final two weekends of the regular season looming, the freshman’s performance highlighted a disciplined effort from a banged-up team in search of a reset.
“I just thought it was a huge, strong game from us from start to finish,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I thought we played very simple, very hard, very strong.”
With regard to Vesey’s status, the elder Donato revealed few details but is hopeful that the star left wing will return to the lineup soon. The Crimson now sits third in the ECAC standings and 12th in the PairWise Rankings with two weeks remaining in the regular season.
“I’m not at liberty to discuss health, but we’re hopeful that it’s nothing too serious, and I think the powers that be decided that we’d give it a few days before we thought it was game ready,” Ted Donato said.
All things considered, Harvard’s night began less than auspiciously. Midway through the first period, Union appeared to take the early lead after Dutchman junior Matt Wilkins redirected an outside shot past Crimson goaltender Merrick Madsen, but the goal was called back for a high stick.
The game’s first official goal came with 2:10 to play in the first period from the stick of Brayden Jaw, whose blast found the back of co-captain Kyle Criscuolo and the skate of Ryan Donato before trickling past Sakellaropoulos.
Harvard continued to pressure in the second period, drawing three power plays. With over five minutes to play in the middle frame, junior Alex Kerfoot broke Criscuolo free on a stretch pass to draw a slash on Union’s J.C. Brassard. As time expired on the ensuing man advantage, junior Sean Malone connected on a feed from Clay Anderson across the left faceoff circle to give Harvard a two-goal lead. Minutes later, sophomore forward Seb Lloyd forced a hook on Wilkins at 19:45 in the period to set up Donato’s second strike off the next faceoff.
Out of the intermission, Wilkins brought the visitors back within two goals, deflecting an outside shot from Nick DeSimone. Minutes later, Sebastien Gingras clipped Harvard’s right post with a backhander from the high slot, but that would be the last shot to beat sophomore goaltender Merrick Madsen, who finished the night with 24 saves.
With Sakellaropoulos pulled after a 22 save effort, Ryan Donato completed his hat trick with a flying breakaway that finished with the freshman crashing into the empty net. After the game, his teammates awarded him with the player of the game hat, an honor that comes with a speech.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

In front of the liveliest crowd of the year, the Harvard men’s basketball team failed to escape Yale for its third consecutive loss at Lavietes Pavilion. Though the teams were nearly even in the second half, a 9-0 run by the Bulldogs (17-5, 8-0 Ivy League) midway through the first half created enough separation to seal the eventual 67-55 win over the Crimson (10-14, 2-6).
As the Crimson digs itself an even deeper hole in the Ivy standings, the team sees the second half of the Ivy season as a chance to show its pride in the program and give younger players even more experience.
“You know looking back there at all the championship [banners], teams are coming for us,” junior forward Zena Edosomwan said. “At the end of the day, despite our record, you have to keep fighting and it’s about pride. Obviously the NCAA Tournament, NIT, things we’ve been accustomed to, it’s not happening currently, but at the end of the day we’re competitors.”
BULLDOG BALANCE
Despite coming into the game as seven-point road favorites, Yale came out looking as though the sting of falling to Harvard in last year’s Ivy playoff was still fresh.
While the Crimson kept it close early, with eight minutes remaining in the first half, Yale forward Justin Sears went to work. Sears shot just two-of-six from the floor in the opening minutes, but a layup with 8:08 remaining gave the Bulldogs a lead it would never relinquish. The senior added eight more points over the ensuing five minutes to stretch the lead to nine, which peaked at 11 before halftime.
“He has a really unorthodox game,” Edosomwan said. “Watching the movements, the shots, everything was sort of unexpected...It’s hard to guard because he’s so shifty with the way he moves, movements I haven’t really seen before.”
But Sears wasn’t alone in picking apart the Crimson defense. With senior guard Jack Montague missing from the lineup and senior forward Brandon Sherrod in foul trouble for most of the game, starters Anthony Dallier, Makai Mason, and Nick Victor allowed Yale to play an inside-out style that spread the Crimson defense to its limits. Mason and Dallier each had double-digit scoring performances while Victor led all players on the floor with12 rebounds.
“They are a really balanced team,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “This is a veteran team, not having the kid Montague is a blow to them but they have been able to pick it up with Mason coming in and starting...I just know that they are good and playing well.”
CRIMSON INCONSISTENCIES
One characteristic of the young Harvard team is that on any given night, a different player can lead the team on the offensive end. While Edosomwan has been arguably the most consistent, the Crimson has had seven different players lead the team in scoring at least once over the course of the year. While players have noted it makes the offense more difficult to defend, it also highlights that Amaker’s squad has struggled to put all of the pieces together at the same time.
After returning from injury in a limited capacity Friday night against Brown, Saturday was the first time that Edosomwan played a full game since leaving the game against Columbia with a thigh injury. Though he struggled in the first half, making just three of nine shots from the floor, the L.A. native finished the night with 18 points and 10 rebounds, his ninth double-double of the year.
While the offense eventually clicked from the paint, it never got going on the perimeter. Freshman guard Corey Johnson hit four treys on 50 percent shooting from deep, but the team failed to make five three-pointers for just the second time this year.
“[It’s] really tough for us when we can’t get the outside production we need from perimeter players to kind of balance us out, having Zena on the inside,” Amaker said. “...We need better production around him sometimes, to make some three-point shots....We are not getting enough production to be a balanced team.”
