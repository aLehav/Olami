After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three years ago, Harvard men’s lacrosse midfielder Daniel Eipp led the Crimson to the Ivy League Championship game, tallying a goal and an assist in Harvard’s 12-8 upset of Penn in the semifinal match. This Friday, the 5’10”, 180-pounder was recognized for his talents at the highest level when the Rochester Rattlers of Major League Lacrosse took him with the 32nd pick in 14th MLL Collegiate Draft.
With the fourth round draft choice, Eipp became the fifth player in Harvard program history to be drafted by an MLL team and the first since when former teammates Kevin Vaughn ’12 and Daniel DiMaria ’12 were taken 14th and 41st, respectively, in the 2012 draft.
The Syracuse, NY native has scored 46 goals in just 36 games in his three-year collegiate career and has accolades such as being the NEILA All-New England Rookie of the Year and a sophomore All-Ivy second-teamer.
Eipp posted his best statistics as a sophomore, when he was second on the Crimson in total points scored, 42. A knee injury midway through junior year kept him out of eight games and perhaps pushed him a few slots down the draft board.
Even with the minor setback, the midfielder not only has earned high honors as a collegiate athlete but also has played at the international level. Competing on the Under-19 U.S. National Team for the 2012 Lacrosse World Championships in Finland, Eipp was one of eight American players to score in the United States’ 10-8 win over Canada for the U-19 team’s seventh straight gold medal.
The former high school All-American, who told laxmagazine.com for his US National Team biography that the best advice he received from a coach was to “Dream big, but take it one day at a time and give your best”, now has the chance to take the step of a lifetime.
Immediately after Eipp completes his senior campaign at the College, he will have the opportunity to sign with the Rattlers and compete for the professional team. But with Major League Lacrosse schedule beginning on April 26, the same day Harvard faces off against New Haven rival Yale, Eipp won’t be able to make the switch, should he choose to, until after the Ivy League Tournament in early May.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just days after dropping its second game of the season at Connecticut, the Harvard men’s basketball team returned to Lavietes Pavilion Saturday looking to right the ship against Dartmouth in its first Ivy League contest of the season.
Powered by a 16-2 run early in the second half and 17 points from senior guard Brandyn Curry, the Crimson (14-2, 1-0 Ivy) opened its conference schedule with a convincing victory over the Big Green (7-7, 0-1), 61-45.
With the score tied at 30 early in the second half, the Harvard co-captain took control, as the team exploded for 16 of the game’s next 18 points to build up a double-digit lead that would stand for the rest of the contest.
Over the course of the Crimson surge, Curry notched eight of his 17 points. He capped the charge with a huge block on a jumper from Big Green guard Tyler Melville that led to a steal by sophomore forward Agunwa Okolie. Okolie carried the ball the length of the floor and threw down a dunk that generated a roar from the crowd and put the Crimson up, 46-32, with 12:23 remaining.
“[Curry’s] finding his rhythm and feeling more and more comfortable and confident,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “You just see the old Brandyn emerging.”
After missing nine games with a left Achilles injury, Curry has slowly been making his way back into the Crimson rotation. The senior played his most minutes all season in Wednesday’s loss to Connecticut but shot just two-for-12 from the field. Dartmouth held him scoreless in the first half, but upon returning from the locker room, the senior broke out of his slump in huge fashion.
“The Achilles is doing really good now—almost in the final stages—so I’m starting to be able to explode off it,” Curry said. “It’s all coming together right now, right in time. It’s conference time, it’s go time, so there’s no excuses.”
Prior to the momentum swing in the second half, the teams were locked in a tightly-contested battle. Harvard could not find a way to contain Big Green forward Gabas Maldunas, who was responsible for 14 of his team’s 27 first half points, including a fade-away jumper as the final buzzer sounded.
“There was not much we could do [to stop Maldunas],” Amaker said. “He’s a 6-foot-9 guy that can put the ball on the floor and drive it. So we tried to shrink the floor…I’m very pleased [that] we didn’t over-help because Maldunas is a good passer and can find shooters.”
The Dartmouth junior finished with a game-high 23 points, converting nine of his 13 attempts from the field. But the Crimson defense managed to contain the rest of his teammates, who shot just 25 percent for the game. From beyond the arc, the Big Green converted just two of its 11 attempts.
Powering the way for Harvard in the first half was junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi. The forward was all over the floor in the first frame, recording 10 points, three rebounds, two steals, and a block. He went on to score 16 in the game.
Wesley Saunders, the Crimson’s leading scorer this season, sat out for his second consecutive game. As a result, Amaker went to his bench early, giving significant minutes to several players who started on the sideline.
Sophomore forward Evan Cummins provided the biggest spark off the bench, putting up eight points in his eight minutes of play in the first half.
Cummins got his name on the score sheet for the final time with 4:30 remaining in the first frame. Senior guard Brandyn Curry used a pump fake to get past one defender at the three-point line before driving to the hoop. The guard went up and found Cummins inside the paint, who earned the bucket and the foul. The sophomore converted the three-point play at the line—his second of the game—extending Harvard’s lead to 25-18.
The performance of the Crimson defense proved to be one of the biggest factors in the victory. Harvard forced 18 turnovers, while surrendering the ball just eight times. The Crimson capitalized on its opportunities, outscoring Dartmouth 24-4 in points off turnovers.
The victory over the Big Green marks the 17th consecutive win for Harvard at Lavietes. The Crimson will have to square up against Dartmouth again on the road in the back end of a lengthy home-and-home in two weeks.
“Nobody is going to fold down for us just because we’re picked to win it all,” Curry said. “Everybody’s going to bring their best shot…Every game is going to be a fight, and we see that. We got a taste of that today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After its first game of 2014, the Harvard women’s basketball team can cross ‘start Ivy League season undefeated’ off its New Years resolutions.
The Crimson’s foray to Leede Arena this year looked much different from last year’s, when offensive struggles and a flurry of turnovers handed the team one of three conference losses all season. On Saturday, Harvard (10-4, 1-0 Ivy), led by junior forward Temi Fagbenle’s 21 points, kicked off its Ancient Eight run with a 73-63 victory over Dartmouth (2-12, 0-1).
“It’s an important win—last year we lost at Dartmouth, and in the Ivy League, there’s no end of the season tournament or anything, so every game is championship night,” co-captain Christine Clark said. “Every game is so important, so even though it wasn’t as pretty as we’d like it to be, we’ll take the win.”
The Big Green kept it close through the majority of the contest, never allowing the Crimson to extend its lead past 12. Although Harvard held guard Fanni Szabo, the league’s leading scorer, scoreless in the first half and to just 10 points in the second half, Dartmouth responded with a different offensive weapon—one familiar to the Crimson.
Point guard Nicola Zimmer, who burned the Crimson with 18 in the two teams’ last meeting, tallied 16 to lead the Big Green’s offensive attack, hitting key treys whenever Harvard began to build a lead.
“We thought if we could take [Szabo] out, they would be very weakened offensively, but their point guard, Nic Zimmer, had a tremendous game,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “She has been coming back from an injury and hasn’t really played or shot that well, and unfortunately she shot pretty well tonight, so she picked up the slack that number 15 gave up.”
Dartmouth’s Abbey Schmitt knocked down two free throws with 3:30 remaining in the game to pull the Big Green within seven, but on Harvard’s ensuing possession, guard Jasmine Evans kicked the ball out to Fagbenle, who was waiting in the left wing. The forward knocked down the baseline jumper, cementing the Crimson’s lead.
“[Temi’s play] hasn’t fluctuated,” Delaney-Smith said. “30 minutes is a lot for her, but she commanded the floor well, she rebounded really well. I thought she caught and shot more stuff around the basket than she has all year, so I’m pleased with that, and I think that needs to be a bigger part of her game.”
Fagbenle, who netted 10 of 14 shots on the day and added six rebounds, spearheaded an offense that enjoyed success on the inside, despite some easy layups not falling.
The Crimson scored 52 of its 73 points in the paint—more than double that of the Big Green’s 22 points.  A large part of that success from the height advantage of Harvard’s post players, as the Crimson held the edge in boards, 38-28. Harvard pulled down 17 offensive boards, allowing the team to capitalize on multiple second- and third-chance opportunities.
“That was one of our points going into halftime, to keep rebounding, and we did a very good job on offensive boards and defensive boards as well—I don’t remember them getting too many second-chance opportunities,” Clark said. “I think we were just pursuing it harder than they were.”
The game was the Crimson’s first since a 64-44 loss to Fordham on December 30, and the long break showed early as the lead shifted six times in the first 10 minutes.
“We were so excited about starting conference that we were trying to force ourselves, and our shots weren’t falling, so we were trying harder, and I think we’re too good to fall into that scenario,” Delaney-Smith said.
Twelve minutes into the game, Clark scored her only points of the first half from behind the charity stripe to give Harvard a seven-point lead, and the Big Green was unable to cut the deficit for the remainder of the game. Clark finished the contest with 12 points, joining Fagbenle, Evans, and senior center Elise Gordon in the double-digit club.
Despite shooting just 8.3% from downtown, the Crimson was able to hang onto its lead by knocking down 92.3% of its free throws and protecting the ball—after averaging 19 turnovers this season, the team coughed it up just 13 times against Dartmouth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a 61-45 win over Dartmouth (7-7, 0-1 Ivy League), the Harvard men’s basketball team started (14-2, 1-0) its 2014 Ivy League season much the same way it did last year. But make no mistake: this is not last year’s team.
Of the 61 points scored by the Crimson, just seven came from players that started on last year’s championship team. Arguably last year’s two most important players, juniors Kenyatta Smith and Wesley Saunders, watched the game in suits. All-Ivy sophomore guard Siyani Chambers missed five of eight shots, with as many turnovers as assists (two). Senior co-captain Laurent Rivard missed both shots from behind the arc and the team made only two threes overall.
And still the Crimson never trailed, getting 29 combined points from sophomore Evan Cummins and seniors Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry. Junior Steve Moundou-Missi outscored the rest of last year’s seven-man rotation by himself, chipping in 16 and making all eight of his free throws.
“We talk about our bench and our balance,” coach Tommy Amaker said. “When you look at our effort today, that is what we were able to accomplish—using our bench very well and having balance on the floor in terms of our production.”
Both Curry and Amaker talked afterward about replacing Saunders’ production by committee. The senior did his part, filling the box score with 15 points, six assists, five rebounds, and two blocks, but said on any given night anyone must be ready to step up.
“You never know whose number is going to be called,” Curry said. “It’s probably going to be someone different every night. That is what is special about our team.”
LEADING ON DEFENSE
On Saturday, the Crimson’s best offense was its defense. Dartmouth committed three turnovers on its first three possessions as Harvard jumped out to a quick nine-point advantage. When the Big Green tied the game at 30-all a minute into the second half, the Crimson buckled down.
Dartmouth’s next four possessions: Miss. Turnover. Miss. Turnover. After two Maldunas free throws, the Crimson picked up just where they left off.
Turnover. Turnover. Miss. Turnover. Turnover.
When Dartmouth finally made its second field goal of the half, Harvard was up 14. Overall the Big Green shot just 38 percent from the game and made only two of its 11 three-point attempts.
“I thought our defense was outstanding in the second half,” Amaker said. “They missed shots and I would like to think that we played a hand in that with defensive intensity and our ability to get stops up and down the floor… An outstanding effort by our team, especially in the second half.”
NEW WAYS TO SCORE
For all its efforts on the defensive end, Harvard struggled for the second straight game to score without Saunders. Not only is the junior the Crimson’s best option when the shot clock runs down, but also its most consistent penetrator—able to collapse defenses and open up the floor for three-point marksmen like Rivard, Curry, and Chambers, who missed six of eight threes Saturday.
Against UConn, Harvard compensated with 22 threes; unable to get into the lane, Chambers and Rivard often hoisted shots three or four feet behind the arc. Dartmouth was a different story. Harvard scored the majority of its points in the paint, driving at will in the 16-2 second half run that broke the game wide open.
Amaker said that the team was able to succeed in the paint because of its deep post rotation. Even without Smith, the team’s most effective post presence a year ago, the Crimson go five-deep in the frontcourt.
“We talked about our big guys doing things in a committee-like way,” Amaker said. “We are getting solid play out of different people. I think the front line is key to our team. If we can get them all out there and producing for our team, we are going to go as they go.”
When shots were not falling, the Crimson lived at the line. Harvard, which shoots just over 74 percent as a unit, made 19 of 24 free throws. When the Crimson made just three shots during the last ten minutes of the first half, it compensated with seven trips to the foul line.
With conference play having begun, Curry said the team has pushed off concerns about how it wins. What matters now, in a fourteen-game regular season with no postseason tournament, is getting the job done.
“It’s coming together, right in time,” Curry said. “It’s conference time; it’s go time. No excuses.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite the deep freeze over most of the country, three Harvard athletes stayed particularly hot this past week and earned themselves co-athlete of the week honors.
Alexander Kerfoot, Men’s Hockey
With the men’s ice hockey team down 2-1 in the last minute this past Tuesday, a loss seemed imminent. But on a last ditch effort, freshman forward Alexander Kerfoot netted a goal with 49 seconds remaining to lead the Crimson to a 2-2 tie against No. 8 Quinnipiac.
With senior goaltender Raphael Girard pulled, Harvard had an extra man and one last chance on the attack to try to slip a goal past Quinnipiac goalie Michael Garteig. Junior defenseman Patrick McNally sent a pass to Kerfoot on his way towards the net. After passing out wide to sophomore Kyle Criscuolo, the first-year player received the puck in the front of the net and was able to poke it into the back of the net, extending Harvard’s point streak to four games.
Sydney Daniels, Women’s Hockey
Kerfoot was not the only freshman to engage in last-minute heroics this week. With the No. 4 women’s ice hockey team tied at two goals apiece against Northeastern on Saturday, freshman forward Sydney Daniels put a backhand shot past the goaltender with 2:03 remaining in the final period to give the Crimson a 3-2 victory.
The Huskies’ Hayley Scamurra knotted the game up at 2-2, 14:52 into the last frame with a backhand herself. But just over three minutes later, junior forward Samantha Reber chased a puck into the offensive zone, sending a crossing pass into Daniels, who promptly finished just past the outstretched pad of Huskies goalie Chloe Desjardins to give Harvard the lead.
DJ White, Men’s Volleyball
Meanwhile, north of the U.S. border, junior outside hitter DJ White also helped dig the men’s volleyball team out of a 2-1 deficit, leading the Crimson to a 3-2 win over Laval University on Wednesday.
Knotted at 25-25 in the fourth set, the Harvard attack propelled by White rallied off two straight points to win the set, forcing a tiebreaking set that the Crimson would go on to win.
The junior led the Harvard attack, recording 21 out of the Crimson’s 66 kills en route to the program’s first win in Canada. The third-year player was also efficient, logging only one error and a kill percentage of .513.
White also contributed to the defensive effort, notching seven digs in the team’s first win of the year.
White also led the squad with 14 kills on Thursday against Laval in a losing effort, 3-1.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last season, the Harvard men’s squash team took its undefeated record to Princeton, New Jersey, only to suffer a 5-4 defeat at the hands of the then top-ranked Tigers.
But in this season’s edition of the rivalry, the end result was very different. In fact, it wasn’t even close.
The No. 2 Crimson dominated from start to finish on Saturday, cruising to a 9-0 sweep of No. 7 Princeton at the Murr Center in Cambridge.
“It was definitely a huge win,” co-captain Gary Power said. “I don’t remember the last time we beat Princeton 9-0, a team we shared the Ivy League title with last year.... To come out and win 9-0 today was definitely big.”
Although the Tigers (2-2, 0-1 Ivy) lost several of its top contributors from last year, the team still represented the toughest competition Harvard (6-0, 1-0) had faced this season. The Crimson seized the opportunity to cement its status as one of the top programs in the country.
“We were supposed to beat them, but we didn’t think that it would be this convincing at 9-0,” senior Nigel Koh said. “We all played well today, and I definitely think [we made] a statement.”
The win was Harvard’s sixth sweep of the season, as not a single player has suffered a defeat in 54 total individual matches.
Many of the day’s pairings were controlled from start to finish by Harvard – five players won 3-0 – but other matches did not come as easily and defied the clean impression of the 9-0 final tally. Three contests needed the full five sets to produce a victor, and the ultimate game came down to the wire in each instance.
One of those tight matches came in the third position, where freshman Dylan Murray edged out a five-set victory over Dylan Ward. After falling behind, 2-1, Murray demonstrated poise under pressure and battled to take the final two sets by identical, 11-9 scores.
Harvard received two more wins from freshman Bryan Koh and junior Tyler Olson to seize an early lead.
The Crimson would clinch the overall victory in the second wave of matches, but it would not come easily, as co-captain Brandon McLaughlin and Nigel Koh both clawed their way to victory in five-set matches.
Playing in the second position, McLaughlin won the first set and lost the next two by tight, two-point margins. But McLaughlin demonstrated his resilience by cruising to an 11-2 victory in the fourth game, and he outlasted his opponent, 11-8, in the decisive fifth set.
It was a similar story for Nigel Koh, who fell behind, 2-1, before storming back in the final two games to preserve Harvard’s undefeated mark. As was the case in McLaughlin’s match, the fifth set was competitive to the very end, but Koh ultimately came out on top by a score of 11-9.
“We play a lot of challenge matches against each other [in practice],” Koh said. “We go all out and play to our best. Right now we’re training twice a day, in the morning and in the afternoon, which is helping with our endurance in matches. Thankfully it paid off.”
Senior Thomas Mullaney rounded out the second shift by earning himself a victory in straight sets.
With the Crimson holding a 6-0 lead entering the final wave of matches, the last three pairings would have no bearing on Harvard emerging with a team win. But senior Ali Farag, Power, and sophomore Nicholas Hopcroft all cruised to straight-set victories to ensure that the day would end on a positive note for the Crimson.
The CSA individual national champion in 2012, Farag endured two close opening games but efficiently dispatched Samuel Kang to earn the win at the number one position.
Playing at number four, Power boosted his win total on the season to five, and Hopcroft made short work of his opponent in the seven spot to win another three-setter for Harvard.
Saturday marked the beginning of a five-match home stand for the Crimson, and the showdown with Princeton represented the team’s first significant test of the year.
“More than a statement to everyone else, it’s a statement to ourselves, to see where we’re at and what we need to improve on,” Power said. “There were some good things today, especially from some of the young guys, so we’re pretty pumped about that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
New York, N.Y.— Harvard alumni may have skated to a 7-0 win at the Chelsea Piers Sky Rink Saturday morning, but their undergraduate counterparts would not have their way with Yale that night at the World’s Most Famous Arena.
In the first-ever Rivalry On Ice game, the No. 10 Yale men’s hockey team cruised to a 5-1 win in front of 15,524 at Madison Square Garden. A three-goal Bulldog outburst over a span of three minutes early in the second period left Harvard deflated and its senior starting goaltender on the bench.
Yale (8-3-4, 3-2-3 ECAC) converted on three of four straight shots on goal in the middle frame, starting with a slapshot at the right point from sophomore Cody Learned at 2:35. The Bulldogs scored on their next shot on goal with a long-distance marker from senior defender Gus Young, and Learned poked his second of the night past senior goaltender Raphael Girard’s pads less than 30 seconds later. The score put Yale up, 4-1, and prompted Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 to swap Girard for junior goaltender Steve Michalek.
“Quite frankly, we didn’t have all 20 guys,” Donato said. “The first goal [in the second period] kind of knocked us off balance, and we weren’t able to truly recover.”
For Harvard (5-8-3, 2-6-3 ECAC), it all unraveled too quickly. The Crimson could not respond to the defending national champion’s 1-2-3 punch.
While the Rivalry On Ice’s result will not count toward the ECAC conference standings, the anticipation leading up to this game rivaled its football counterpart.  Saturday’s match-up promised to be the first in an annual series of games that Harvard and Yale will play in New York City.
Crimson and Bulldog alumni gathered for events throughout the city on Saturday to celebrate the teams’ first meeting in Madison Square Garden in over 40 years. National Hockey League legend Mark Messier promoted the event in the days leading up to the Rivalry, and Secretary of State John Kerry was on hand for the ceremonial puck drop. Harvard and Yale wore special throwback uniforms for the occasion. At the conclusion of the game, Messier presented Yale with a game trophy at center ice.
“We got treated like pros all weekend,” Harvard sophomore forward Jimmy Vesey said. “I don’t know if any of us will ever play at MSG again, so it was truly a once in a lifetime experience.”
In the opening frame, Yale controlled the play early before Harvard entered the first intermission with the momentum seemingly on its side.
Sophomore center Stu Wilson connected with freshman forward Mike Doherty in the crease 4:23 into the game to put the Bulldogs up one. Wilson drove past the Harvard goal line on the right side before dropping the puck to Doherty for a one-timer past Girard.
Vesey responded minutes later with a one-timer of his own. After junior defender Pat McNally drew a tripping minor from senior forward Kenny Agostino for the game’s first power play ten minutes into the frame, freshman Luke Esposito set up behind the Yale goal line on the right wing and found Vesey with a well-timed crossing feed to beat freshman goaltender Alex Lyon.
Vesey’s team-leading tenth goal marked a brief Crimson surge as Harvard finished the period controlling the play and outshooting Yale, 14-12.
“I think in the second half of the first period we kind of took the game over a bit,” Donato said. “We used our speed, and [Lyon] made a couple of big saves to keep it at 1-1.”
But the Crimson’s fortunes turned on a bounce in the second.
In Harvard’s last game against Yale—a 2-2 tie on Dec. 7—Girard had a career-high 52 saves—the most by a Crimson goaltender in 29 years. Saturday was a different story as the senior struggled to track the puck from the blueline.
Two and a half minutes into the middle frame, sophomore Yale forward Cody Learned entered the Harvard zone from the right wing and unleashed a quick slap shot from the point that seemed to catch Girard off guard. The puck clipped the senior goaltender’s pads before trickling past the Crimson goal line.
Young struck from the opposite point on Yale’s next shot 5:15 into the period, beating Girard top-shelf through a screen. 26 seconds later, Learned, who earned game MVP honors, punched in his second goal of the night after Girard could not locate a rebound in front of his pads off a long shot from sophomore Yale defender Ryan Obuchowski.
With Michalek in net, Harvard saw only a few chances to get back in the game. Yale limited the Crimson to only four shots on goal in the third period. Agostino added the Bulldogs’ fifth goal with less than nine minutes left in the game off a pass from behind the net by Young.
The next Rivalry On Ice game is slated for January 2015 at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. By then, Donato hopes that his young squad will be a year wiser and more prepared to reclaim a rivalry that has proved somewhat lopsided in recent years.
“If there is a play or a situation that doesn’t go our way, our response needs to be better,” Donato said. “Hopefully we’ll learn from this. I really believe in this team. It’s a good group of character guys, and I think we’ll bounce back from this.”

In the past months, you spent countless hours envisioning your dream college, you poured your heart out in your personal essays, and you encapsulated in two lines each activity you’ve devoted so much time to, even though you could have used a paragraph. Well done. You are now finally done with the crazy marathon that is the college application process. Take time to let that sink in, because you should feel so incredibly proud of yourself.
Pressing that “submit” button probably felt both wonderfully refreshing and very scary. You’ve thought so much about where you hope to end up and how to get there. The time between now and the day you receive your results may feel like a never-ending wait. However, regardless of what the decisions are, some Harvard freshmen shared some thoughts on what to keep in mind:
YingYing Shang ’17, says: “Think bigger in terms of what you want to do in college rather than which college you want to do them at. When you have excitement and passion for the rest of your life and aren’t too dependent on the location you’re going to be doing them at, you’ll be more at peace and enthusiastic no matter where you end up.”
Daniel Wang ‘17 agrees: “You’ve put in all the time and hard work. Now it’s time to relax and enjoy the rest of your high school experience. Your college experience is what you make of it, and not necessarily where you go.”
You only have a few more months of high school left. Cherish it, because these are your last four months of having your friends in one place every day, of being part of a community that has shaped who you are, and of being a kid.
Jason Mahr ’17, says: “Don't worry yourself about colleges, focus instead on enjoying senior year and spending more time with friends. You only get to be a second-semester [high school] senior once. Make the most of it.”
Connor J.H. Bitter ’17 has this message for you: “Enjoy the freedom that comes with being done your applications. Take your mind off of college for a bit and enjoy your senior year. Decisions will come either way, but the last half of your final year with many of your friends only comes once."
And most importantly, feel proud of yourself. You have tried your absolute best, and that is really what matters.
Raul E. Jordan ’17, says: “Feel accomplished because you have made it this far, and no matter what happens, every result in march will be a product of your hard work. Feel reassured that your work will always pay off.”
Kamara A. Swaby ’17, agrees: “Applying to college is always a nerve-wracking process so you should be proud of what you accomplished so far. My best advice is not let the thoughts of the decision rule your life. It's okay to be a little nervous about it but also try to pay attention to all other facets of your life. By keeping your mind not only focused on your application you get to relax a little and you get to free yourself to work on other things. By doing this, the time between now and when the results come in seems shorter. The hard work you put into your application will not go unnoticed and will surely benefit you in the long run.”
A huge congratulations for finishing your college applications. Rest assured that no matter where you go, you will become who you choose to become, and have an amazing college experience. For now, enjoy your last precious months of high school. And most importantly, be proud and confident in the wonderful person you will be presenting to admissions officers. You have worked so hard, and it is now time to give yourself the break you so deserve. Well done.
