After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fifty-eight years ago this week, “Brown v. Board of Education” was first argued before the Supreme Court. When a decision ending racial segregation was handed down almost a year and a half later, it marked perhaps the Court’s greatest triumph of the twentieth century; its assertion of the constitutional rights of black students marked a concrete step toward the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of equality before the laws. But in the years since Brown, interpreting the substance of this equality has complicated the case’s legacy. Recognizing Brown’s relevance for current debates about affirmative action in college admissions helps to clarify these debates and identifies class-based (rather than race-based) affirmative action as the best means of resolving them.
Recently, race-based affirmative action has reemerged in the news as a result of Fisher v. Texas, a case in which two students sued the University of Texas at Austin for using race as a factor in determining admissions. The case marked the first challenge to the Supreme Court’s 2003 ruling in Grutter v. Bollinger, which held that schools could use race as an element in admissions decisions as long as their goal was to increase classroom diversity and not to correct for past discrimination.
The Supreme Court was right to rule out affirmative action based on prior discrimination; past prejudices don’t justify present injustices. Previously, certain racial groups were undoubtedly denied admission to the nation’s top universities solely on the basis of their race. However, affirmative action programs aimed at correcting for past injustices do the same thing—only the race of the rejected students has changed. Admissions officers often reject this accusation by claiming that race is only one factor used in a holistic approach; therefore, no one is accepted or rejected simply on the basis of one feature. This, however, is a fallacy: If two students are equally qualified but differ only in terms of their race, the college may reject one and accept the other, since race is one of the factors used to distinguish them. The use of holistic admissions guidelines still excludes qualified applicants based on their race.
The true injustice of affirmative action programs aimed at rectifying past discrimination relates to the victims of these programs: students who are guilty of no discrimination on their own but who are held collectively accountable for their race’s past actions. The message of Brown was that individuals cannot be defined by their skin color, that race is not relevant in students’ educational abilities and is therefore an improper means of separating children between different classrooms. Yet certain affirmative action policies do just that, reducing students to their membership in either victimized or privileged races and making admissions contingent on that membership.
The same argument applies to the justification ultimately advanced by the Court in the 2003 case, which suggested that race-based affirmative action can be justified when it advances colleges’ compelling interests in achieving campus diversity. Certainly, colleges have an interest in exposing students to different perspectives in the classroom. However, race-based affirmative action programs assume that membership in a given racial group provides students with distinct viewpoints, when in fact, a number of socioeconomic factors likely play a greater role in contributing to their unique perspectives. The problem isn’t that students are being defined by one of their traits (race); it’s that the trait used to define them is an irrelevant one in evaluating their educational opportunities. For example, black students on average score 56 points lower than their white counterparts on the SATs; in contrast, students from the lowest socioeconomic grouping score 399 points lower than those from the highest.
In addition, race-based affirmative action typically benefits only middle- and upper-class minority students, leaving poorer applicants, who truly need a leg-up in the admissions process, without options. A 2004 study of 146 top universities (most of which use race-based affirmative action) found that 74 percent of students were from the highest socioeconomic quartile, and only three percent came from the lowest. Furthermore, class-based systems can still provide for racial diversity on campus, especially when measures beyond personal wealth—such as local poverty levels, parents’ education, and neighborhood school quality—are used to measure socioeconomic status. The 2004 study indicated that race-based affirmative action programs resulted in a student body that consisted of 12 percent African-Americans and Latinos, while no affirmative action system lowered the value to four percent. Finally, a class-based system would provide ten percent representation for these groups. It wouldn’t bring minority admissions to the same levels as race-based systems, but it would come close, and it would do so without consigning students to particular races assumed to define their identities.
In his dissent in the 1896 case of Plessy v. Ferguson—the case Brown overturned —Justice John Marshall Harlan noted, “Our constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.” Harlan’s words are even more relevant today, when racial differences have become an outdated means of establishing diversity and economic distinctions mark the best indicator for distinguishing applicants. Chief Justice John Roberts expressed it best: “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.” That’s the attitude that we should take—the attitude that Brown calls on us to take—in college admissions in the twenty-first century.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Russian journalist Oleg Kashin recently gave an interview on Russian radio, positing that his November assault was spurred by his coverage of a contentious highway project near Moscow. After his attack, Kashin lay in a drug-induced coma for days, his jaw broken and his legs and skull fractured. His attackers on the streets of Moscow made sure to mangle his hands, and one of his fingers was lost. His editor at the prominent Russian newspaper, Kommersant, also attributes the savage beating to Kashin’s work covering politics and protests in the city. Russia has a lax stance when it comes to the freedom of the press, and it’s not alone. Although they may seem far away, these places most need their stories told to the world. When voices are silenced, atrocities go unchecked, and so the U.S. government and American public must be more vocal about the injustices faced by foreign reporters in their line of work.
Kashin is merely the latest victim in a string of unsolved crimes against journalists in Russia. In November 2008, after Mikhail Beketov, the editor of the independent newspaper Khimkinskaya Pravda, called for the resignation of the corrupt city leadership in the Moscow suburb of Khimki, his car was blown up. Then thugs beat him within inches of his life, and his injuries necessitated the amputation of a leg and three of his fingers. He is now wheelchair-bound and has so much brain damage that he can’t complete sentences.
Natalia Estemirova was found dead on the side of a highway after being abducted from her home in Chechnya in July 2009. Before her slaying, Estemirova had been investigating kidnappings and other crimes in which she suspected the Chechen government and its Kremlin supporters played a role.  No arrests have been made in her case, and the police appear to be merely paying lip service to the investigation.
After the second vicious murder of a reporter in less than two years, in September, El Diario—the largest newspaper in border town and Mexican drug violence epicenter Ciudad Juarez—ran a front-page editorial begging for mercy from the cartels. The editors volunteered, in a complete surrender to the gangs, to stop reporting on the drug wars.
America prizes its free press, no matter how exasperating some aspects of cable television can be sometimes. That’s why it should be so alarming to hear of a complete capitulation of a major newspaper just south of our border. This is a problem beyond the abstract theory of personal liberty, though. It is also transcends the martyrdom of the slain reporters. Rather, the drug cartels have essentially commanded carte blanche to commit any sin, without the possibility of the truth escaping to the outside world.
We live in a time where kidnapping and even executing journalists is an easy way for fringe extremist groups to get attention. The tragedy of Daniel Pearl, the Wall Street Journal reporter who was kidnapped and ultimately beheaded, is the most infamous of these stories, but journalists are captured and held hostage all too often.
So far, in 2010 alone, 39 journalists have been killed around the world as a direct result of their work. Since 1992, 840 had perished. From the drug wars in Mexico to the rule of law’s disintegration in Somalia, reporters are being threatened and murdered around the world. Often, governments are unwilling or unable to protect reporters or even conduct a thorough investigation in the event of violence. If this trend continues, local news sources will shy away from telling provocative stories and foreign news companies will be too afraid to send employees into dangerous places.
When reporters become political pawns and sacrifices, rather than unbiased storytellers, we all lose. When journalists must choose between telling the truth and saving their lives, stories are distorted or left untold. Corruption and crime can flourish, and the global public is kept in the dark about these atrocities, and they are not addressed.
We need to put a priority on the protection of reporters. The U.S. must let Russia and governments around the world know that it is not acceptable for them to intimidate or assassinate reporters, even if they are looking into dark corners that some would rather remain un-illuminated. Becoming a journalist in a dangerous area is a choice that is made knowing the risks, but it is in the general interest to keep the people who perform this duty safe. Americans have protected the rights of the press at home throughout our history, now it is time to stand up for the freedom of members of the press abroad.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Reserve Officers’ Training Corps, first banned from Harvard in 1969 at the height of the Vietnam War, continues to be prohibited on campus because of the Don’t Ask Don’t Tell policy written and passed by Congress and signed into law by President Clinton in 1993.  The repeal of this federal policy, which has stirred much controversy over the last two decades, seems to be on the horizon. However, even as we stand on the brink of its repeal, we cannot hold ROTC cadets accountable for actions outside of their control.
We are no longer living in the Vietnam era, when personal criticism of soldiers was in vogue. If we have qualms, then we should blame the federal government, not the honorable cadets of ROTC. Those who support the ROTC ban often seem to confuse ROTC cadets with Clinton and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.  The decisions of the federal government have little to do with the opinions of the cadets of ROTC.  Regardless of the problems that we have with the federal government and military, we cannot blame ROTC for them. After all, their means of control over those policies is the same as all other American citizens: their vote.
If we want to protest the decisions of the federal government, we should boycott federal funding and federal student loans, not the service of the many men and women in uniform.  They fight for our freedom; without them, we wouldn’t have the luxury of the protected, Ivy-League bubble within which we all live.
But in spite of the federal government’s culpability for the DADT policy, many still contend that ROTC should not be accepted on campus because the federal government ordered the military to “discriminate” against homosexuals and women.  Harvard’s decision to continue the ban of ROTC on campus rests on the policy that openly gay people cannot serve in ROTC.  Because of the DADT policy, many students are excluded from serving in ROTC. As practiced in the military as a whole, individuals are given discharge if they to admit to being homosexual while serving in ROTC.  Harvard hopes to foster an open campus where any student would be able to join any student group.  Nevertheless, the matter of discrimination in the military is a contentious issue, and there are many people who support and oppose policies like DADT. If we truly hope to foster tolerance and nondiscrimination, then we should not act upon opinions as if they were facts in order to impose policies on the American public and ROTC cadets.
While the intentions of Harvard are admirable in desiring to construct an open campus, if we ban ROTC on campus for these offenses, why not also ban the Catholic Student Association because priests have sexually abused children? Or the Chinese Student Association because the Chinese government often violates human rights? Each of these organizations has as much control over these larger policies as ROTC cadets do over the decisions made by the civilian leaders in the U.S. government.
Obviously, banning these organizations would be ridiculous, which is why I contend that the arguments frequently made against ending the ROTC ban are similarly invalid.  If we ban an organization on campus because of allegations against some larger part of an organization, we are committing a grave injustice.  Since those who oppose ROTC ostensibly desire a “just and open” campus, we shouldn’t punish ROTC cadets for allegations against the federal government or even the military as a whole.
With the repeal of Don’t Ask Don’t Tell imminent—or even if it were not imminent—University President Drew G. Faust should strongly consider ending the banning of ROTC on campus. It is impossible to honor and respect men and women who honorably sacrifice to serve their nation while discriminating against them because of a policy over which they have no control.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, more than 100 people gathered on Boston Common to commemorate World AIDS Day 2010. Prominent among the event’s organizers and attendees were representatives from several Harvard student organizations. We are particularly proud of Harvard students’ involvement in national and international efforts to eradicate AIDS, and we commend the initiative demonstrated by our fellow students as they attempt to hold our leaders accountable for the promises they made during the previous election cycle. Even if their efforts amount to nothing, these students at least are sending an important message about the relevance of youth activism in modern politics.
These campus activists’ engagement in global health policy is particularly admirable when one considers the apathy and political disengagement that unfortunately has become all-too-pervasive in the past two years. Although young voters played a key role in the election of President Obama, recent data suggest that this same demographic was decidedly apathetic in the 2010 election cycle. Only 20 percent of eligible voters under the age of 30 cast ballots a month ago, compared to a record-high 51 percent in November 2008. Given this level of youth disengagement, the new generation of AIDS activists’ passion for justice is truly heartening.
Additionally, it is very exciting to see a diverse coalition of student groups coming together to work on this initiative, especially given how difficult it can be for student groups to collaborate on campus. Among the groups represented at the rally on the Common were the Harvard African Student Association, the Harvard College Global Health and AIDS Coalition, the Black Students Association, the Chinese Students Association, Harvard Queer Students and Allies, and several campus religious groups. This sort of campus unity will be especially critical for continued advocacy efforts.
While we laud these student activists’ focus on increasing U.S. foreign aid for AIDS prevention and treatment through the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, we also want to call attention to the domestic side of AIDS activism. In 2006, 31 percent of new AIDS transmissions in the United States were via heterosexual contact—AIDS is not a problem only among high-risk groups like men who have sex with men and intravenous drug users. As such, it is imperative that public health officials and agencies in the United States emphasize safe sex practices among all Americans, regardless of sexual orientation.
Finally, from a policy standpoint, we wholeheartedly agree with the claims made by the Harvard organizers of World AIDS Day 2010. The Obama administration must follow through on its campaign promises to aggressively combat the spread of AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. President Obama’s $300 million funding requests to Congress look particularly pitiful in light of the potentially massive costs of extending the Bush tax cuts, the $84 billion requested by Senate Republicans for the modernization of our nuclear arsenal, and the simple fact that the requested amount would do little more than adjust for inflation in the current AIDS budget. It is high time the White House follow through on its lofty rhetoric concerning global AIDS policy, and we applaud the Harvard students and affiliates who have already donated so much of their time and energy to such a worthwhile cause.

Grammy Award-winning comedian Lewis N. Black stressed the importance of pursuing one’s passions at a “Conversations with Kirkland” event on Monday afternoon, including fits of laughter along the way.
“The best thing you can do for yourself is to take some time to figure out what you are interested in and do it,” Black said on Monday, which marked his second visit to Kirkland House, as he attended the forum last year as well. “Otherwise I’m just going to tell you, you are fucked.”
Black encouraged students to “do things that mean something to you and follow your passion because everything else is meaningless.”
Black used his own life as an example of pursuing a passion despite certain obstacles.
“On the economic ladder, a playwright is financially just below a crack whore,” he quipped. “Only a crack whore has more motivation.”
Despite the financial struggles he encountered, Black said he pursued his acting because “content is doing what makes one happy, and theater made me happy.”
He said his interest in theater developed at a young age because his parents often took him to theater.
“I got hooked on theater,” Black said, “even though it was totally out of my realm.”
Black said he excelled academically, knowing “early on how to pace myself and study,” adding that he graduated third in his class of about 500 students.
“I should have been in law, but why didn’t I go into law?” Black said. “It makes me sick.”
On the other hand, Black said he found something attractive about theater.
“It’s a fruity way to put it, but [theater is] magical,” he said.
“It’s something in real time with everyone present,” he added.
The conversation deviated from the traditional format as it also included a dialogue between Black and Professor Kenneth S. Rogoff exchanging ideas about the economy.
Black pressed for providing health care for everyone and redistributing wealth.
“People who don’t understand this are shitholes,” Black said.
“I’m learning a lot of new words and sign languages,” Rogoff replied, referring to a sign language translator who was sitting behind Black and translated the conversation during his speech.
Although Black said he believes the economy is improving, “the fact that there is no job market may be a blessing in disguise. You have the opportunity to create your own job,” he said.
The “Conversations with Kirkland” Series was founded in 2002 by Peter V. Emerson, resident scholar of Kirkland house and former Kennedy School of Government student, and co-housemasters Tom C. Conley and Verena A. Conley. The event was co-sponsored by the Office of the Arts and Kirkland House.

Baseball fans of different ages munched on buttery popcorn as they listened to Larry Lucchino, chief executive and president of the Boston Red Sox, discuss the relationship between baseball and politics yesterday afternoon at the Harvard Kennedy School.
Kennedy School professor Graham T. Allison ’62 moderated the conversation, saying Lucchino would provide a unique perspective on the reality of politics.
“Baseball is more than a business. It is more than a sport. It occupies an important role in the psychological life of the residents in this area,” Lucchino said at the beginning of the discussion.
He recounted lessons he learned as chief executive of three different major baseball teams: the Baltimore Orioles, the San Diego Padres, and the Boston Red Sox.
“Politics are profoundly different from Baltimore and San Diego to Boston,” Lucchino said.
“They reflect different cultural and geographical characteristics of the town,” he added.
He recalled the political differences he encountered in his experiences renovating different stadiums.
In Oriole Park, the government controlled the funding and was the main supporter, whereas a grassroots effort was more effective for rejuvenating Petco Park in San Diego, he said.
“There is an extraordinary relationship between sports teams and cities,” said attendee Samuel B. Novey ’11. “I was impressed to hear that Lucchino seems to have thought deeply about the civic role of sports teams.”
Lucchino emphasized in each city, baseball teams should use different techniques to act as social and civic institutions for their fan bases.
He explained that as chief executive, his role is to be a bridge between the baseball team and the city, dealing with elements of taxation, regulation, and instruction.
“As a baseball executive you have to recognize the politics and apply it to what you do,” he said.
Keeping with baseball tradition, during a question and answer session, Lucchino brought out a gift bag and, to the amusement of the filled room, threw signed baseballs, key chains, and t-shirts to those who asked questions.
During the session he spoke of the various changes baseball is undergoing across the country.
He also discussed the obligation baseball has to serve the community as both a sport and a business.

Harvard Business School Professor Peter Tufano ’79 will leave Harvard next year to become Dean of the Saïd Business School at Oxford.
Tufano said his decision to leave Harvard stems from his desire to play a key role in the development of the school.
“Whereas Harvard Business School is a wonderful business school with a 100 plus year history, Saïd Business School is 15 years old,” Tufano said. “It’s still a young entrepreneurial firm that has lots of future and I want to help shape that future.”
Tufano will replace the current Saïd Business School Dean, Colin Mayer, on July 1, 2011.
Tufano has had a long history at Harvard, graduating summa cum laude from the College in economics and earning his MBA and Ph.D from Harvard’s graduate schools.
Tufano has now taught at the Business School for 22 years and has developed three original classes at Harvard.
“In his time here Peter contributed tremendously to the intellectual capacity of the school through his teaching and research,” Business School Dean Nitin Nohria wrote in an e-mail statement. “He brought keen management insight to his administrative duties and was one of our most important ambassadors to the rest of the University.”
Oxford officials praised Tufano’s academic reputation and record of forging collaborations at Harvard.
“These achievements, combined with his impressive teaching experience and commitment to use rigorous business research to improve business and regulatory practice, make him the ideal person to lead the school,” Professor Andrew D. Hamilton, Vice Chancellor of the University of Oxford, said in a statement.
Tufano said he plans on teaching his spring class with Harvard Law School professor Howell E. Jackson and continue developing the Harvard Innovation Lab in Allston, a project announced by the Business School earlier this year, until his departure.
Tufano, who wrote the original proposal for the lab and co-chairs the Allston Work Team, said he hopes it will serve as a site for innovation and entrepreneurship among students from across the University.
“I will work as hard as I can to make sure that that’s a reality before I leave this campus,” Tufano said.
Tufano said there was always a chance that he might one day return to Harvard.
“It’s the university that I have grown up at and I care for deeply,” Tufano said of Harvard. “But for the moment I have a challenge ahead of me that I’m looking forward to.”

The Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—announced on Monday an overhaul to its governance structure that would nearly double its membership and impose term limits.
The reforms—the first major structural change since the Corporation was founded in 1650—include boosting the number of members from seven to 13 and creating several new committees to address issues including finance, governance, and capital planning and facilities.
The change brings the Corporation’s structure closer in line with the governing bodies of other major universities, which tend to have larger memberships and more numerous committees.
Laid out in a Corporation report released Monday, the reforms come on the heels of heavy criticism levied against the Corporation by some faculty and alumni, who say that the body lacks transparency, accountability, and community engagement. The reforms partly address these criticisms, said Corporation member Robert D. Reischauer ’63, who serves as its senior fellow.
“I’m cautiously optimistic,” said engineering professor Frederick H. Abernathy, who co-wrote a Boston Globe op-ed critical of the Corporation last year. “The optimistic part is they’ve actually undertaken potentially some reform—it’s all potential and now the proof will be who they appoint. Let’s say if they appoint six Wall Street people, I would say it’s not an improvement at all.”
By increasing the number of members on the Corporation, the body will be better able to meet with members of the Harvard community and increase information exchange between itself and the University it governs, Reischauer said.
The reforms also include instituting term limits for members of the Corporation, formally known as the President and Fellows of Harvard College. Fellows will now be limited to six years in office with the possibility of a six-year extension, though the Governance Review Committee’s report stated that “some adjustments will likely be necessary to assure appropriately staggered periods of service” as the body grows to its larger size.
The larger membership will allow for individuals on the Corporation to focus on issues related to their area of expertise, potentially increasing the breadth and depth of the body’s work, he added.
“There’s sort of a ‘Goldilocks solution’—the addition of a very few people would not have solved the issue of capacity and diversity of expertise,” said Harvard Graduate School of Education professor Richard P. Chait, an expert on higher education governance who advised the Corporation on its reforms. “Too many would have changed the character of the group from the intimate group.”
Even with its expanded membership, Harv ard’s Corporation will remain the smallest among its peers, according to Chait.The body will continue to select its own members and intends to choose the new six over the next two to three years.
University President Drew G. Faust said in an interview that the ongoing selection process for the new members of the Corporation will incorporate feedback from the Harvard community, potentially addressing concerns that the body has grown too insular.
“When we search for members of the Corporation we do a lot of outreach, we talk to people about: ‘What does the Corporation need? What issues should we be considering?’” Faust said. “I think that looking for new Corporation members on a regular basis is going to be one of the avenues of constant communication.”
With only seven members, the Corporation has previously included its entire membership in the organization’s work, and the creation of committees to focus on particular issues is a major departure from its past structure.
However, Anne D. Neal ’77, president of the American Council of Trustees and Alumni, criticized the Corporation for expressly declining to add an academic affairs committee to its structure.
“The Corporation has too often ignored academic oversight in the past and the proposed structure does not improve on that situation,” she said.
Reischauer said the review’s launch in the fall of 2009 was part of and motivated by a broader University effort to re-examine its policies in the aftermath of the financial crisis—a moment of self-reflection for the broader University community.
“The fact is that all parts of the University have been asked to look themselves in the mirror, reassess how they might do their job to the optimal degree, and it’s only natural that we should do the same thing,” Reischauer said.
But—just as many parts of the University continue to make changes after the economic downturn—it may take years to assess whether the Corporation’s pledge to be more open will actually be realized.
“They have made their vows, but so do men and women make vows in marriage. In seven years, half of them have broken their vows,” Abernathy said. “So we’ll have to wait and see.”

Harvard Kennedy School Registrar and Director of Admissions Michael P. Burke will take over as the new Registrar for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Dean of the College Evelyn M. Hammonds announced in an e-mail Monday afternoon.
Burke, who has been at the Kennedy School for 10 years, will replace Barry S. Kane, who left in July to head Wellesley’s Registrar’s Office and take up an assistant deanship. Burke will take office on January 31, 2011.
As Registrar, Burke will be in charge of student enrollment and records for both the College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
“The job of Registrar for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences is a big job because there’s a lot of constituencies,” Secretary of the Administrative Board John “Jay” L. Ellison said. “The FAS is a complicated beast.”
While Burke was chosen from an international pool of candidates, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris indicated Burke’s experience at Harvard will be important in easing his transition to his new position at FAS.
“He knows Harvard, and Harvard is a complicated place,” Harris said via Skype last night.
Burke will also serve on the Administrative Board, subject to final approval from Hammonds, Ellison said.
Burke received a bachelor’s in Political Science from Syracuse University and a Master’s of Education in Higher Education Administration from Harvard, according to Hammonds’ e-mail.
Burke’s experience with implementing new technology at the Kennedy School set him apart from others considered for the job, FAS Spokesperson Jeff Neal said. During his time as registrar, Burke oversaw the movement to online application and registrations and the creation of a new Student Information System.
“On the technological side he’s been instrumental in creating a streamlined, user-friendly system,” said Kennedy School Dean of Students Christopher M. Fortunato ’94, a former Crimson editor.
Burke’s experience with technological transitions parallels that of his predecessor Kane, who similarly oversaw the movement to online registration, grading, and course evaluations—known as the Q guide.
In an interview with The Crimson in July, Kane named the digitalization and transformation of the Q guide, formerly the Committee on Undergraduate Education guide, as the biggest accomplishment from his time as registrar. Before Kane’s tenure, course evaluations took place during the final class of the year, were filled out by hand, and were optional for professors. At the time of his departure, Kane indicated that the transition to digital records will continue to be a priority for his successor. He said his biggest regret was not creating an electronic system for the submission of midterm grades.
But, for Burke, the technological aspects of the job are merely tools to help achieve his larger goal.
“I am sure technology will be part of our road map,” Burke wrote in an e-mail, adding that “it should always be a goal of a registrar to facilitate the educational mission without becoming an obstacle.”
Fortunato said Burke’s work at the Kennedy School bridging the technological and personal aspects of the registrar’s job will serve him well in his new role.
“You know when someone’s first priority is supporting people and students and you know when it’s not,” said Fortunato. “He’s not blind-sided by all the technical and logistical aspects.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nora Molyneaux lives in a first floor suite in Grays Hall with newly painted walls. Her bright pink bike sits in the hallway outside her door.
She rarely makes it on time to her entryway’s study breaks, but she has a close relationship with the proctors—occasionally waking them up in the middle of the night.
She can be a picky eater and isn’t always happy with the food in Annenberg Hall.
Life for Nora, who is almost three years old, isn’t so different from those of the college freshmen who live around her.
Lindsay C. Page and Bradley J. Molyneaux, Nora’s parents, are co-proctors in Grays this year. They are among the five proctor couples raising children in freshman dorms. Three more are expected to join by the end of the academic year.
While raising children on a college campus has its difficulties, proctor parents say Harvard Yard is a welcoming and stimulating place to raise their children.
THROUGH PARENTS’ EYES
Growing up on campus is different from the typical American suburban life—these children spend some of their day interacting with students more than four times their age.
“There are always unexpected things happening,” Page says, citing the spontaneous performances of the marching band and various choral societies in the yard as examples.
“It’s exciting to view those sorts of wacky college campus happenings through Nora’s eyes,” Page says.
While they are surrounded by undergraduates on all sides, proctors say their families are able to form a close community on campus. They often go to museums together or organize picnics in the yard so that their children can interact with others their age.
Sky, who is co-proctoring with her husband Geoff in Grays, says the proctor parent community on campus came to her aid after her son Harlan was born. The couple did not wish to publish their last names for this article.
“I had a pretty difficult labor and when we came back [on campus] the other proctors had arranged to bring us meals,” she says.
Sometimes the undergraduates in their entryway help make parenting a little bit easier.
One day when Nora had to return home sick from day care, Page sent an e-mail to her entryway asking for help, and one of her freshman looked after Nora for part of the day.
But raising a child on Harvard’s campus also comes with its difficulties.
“You are trying to wrangle a baby up and down the steps, and there are tourists taking pictures of you,” Sky says of juggling a six-month-old and groceries from their car parked several blocks away from the yard.
‘PART OF THE TEAM’
For their part, many freshmen say they enjoy the presence of a young child in their entryway because it helps them to put their problems into perspective.
Robert E. Powers ’14, who lives in Page and Molyneaux’s entryway, says challenging Nora to clean her plate before him in Annenberg Hall for example provides “a good break” from college life.
“It doesn’t seem like a lot on the surface, but when you’re living such a hectic lifestyle like we are in college, little things like that just brighten up your day,” Powers says.
Stephen L. Kent ’14, another student in the same entryway, agreed. Kent says when he comes back exhausted from a long marching band concert, seeing Nora cheers him up.
“She’ll see me in my band uniform, and she’ll just smile. That’ll make it all worth it,” he says.
Many proctors’ children quickly become important members of their dorm community.
Elizabeth C. Spira ’11, a Peer Advising Fellow in Sky and Geoff’s entryway, stressed how well-integrated the proctors’ son Harlan is in Grays.
“All the e-mails are signed Sky, Geoff and Harlan. He’s part of the team,” she says.
For the annual Freshman Pumpkin Carving Contest, their entryway emptied a pumpkin and carved two holes on the sides. They then had 6-month-old Harlan wear it.
“We called it ‘pumpkin couture,’” Geoff says, laughing.
Looking back at his time at Harvard as a small child, George W. Stubbs ’11, who lived in Greenough for the first three years of his life, says interacting with undergraduates as a young child has had a profound effect on his life.
“My theory is that it socializes you very well,” Stubbs says, adding he thinks he is more social and open to talking to people because he was raised on campus.
ADDED RESPONSIBILITY
In addition to being proctors and graduate students, proctor parents face the added challenge of raising young children.
Some undergraduates feel their proctors’ responsibilities as parents can limit their availability.
“Where [my proctor] can go and what she can do is based on how long she can go without the baby,” a student says, who requested anonymity to avoid identifying the proctor. “If you want to interact with [her], then you are interacting with [her] and the baby.”
Page, Nora’s mother, says when family problems arise, she cannot always devote her attention to her students.
She says, however, she thinks the situation was more problematic when Nora was a toddler and demanded more attention.
“She would be in the fit of crying and somebody would show up at the door,” she says. “Now she is older, more reasonable.”
Having a child in the entryway may sometimes distract proctor parents, but students and PAFs say it also fosters a more mature atmosphere in the entryway.
Spira says she thinks the presence of a child in the entryway prompts students to be more cognizant of rules about alcohol and drugs.
Some students say they consider their proctors as almost second parents.
“We always want to be on our best behavior in front of them,” Stephen says.
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, who raised his children on campus as a Resident Dean in Leverett, says proctor parents tend to make dorms feel more like a home to many students.
“They [bring] a perspective that somebody who’s just finishing the undergraduate years doesn’t have,” Dingman says.
HOME, SWEET HOME
The environment in which proctors raise their children is not the differentiating factor—the physical space on campus is vastly different from what they would likely experience in a suburb.
Most proctor suites in the yard do not have kitchens or private bathrooms, which can prove challenging when trying to assign all proctor families a suite adapted to their needs.
Dingman says even though proctor housing is not as flexible as he would like, proctor parents know what to expect when they move in on campus.
“We are very clear with the proctor candidates about what we have,” he says.
When informed by the FDO about incoming proctor families, Senior Manager of Harvard Yard and Freshman Dormitories Anthony Pacillo contacts the parents to address their needs on an individual basis. Some need extra bookshelves and dressers; others come with their own set of furniture.
Harvard Yard Operations also ensures the family suites are safe for children.
Massachusetts’ law prohibits children under six from living in a space with lead paint, which can be found in many of the older dormitories at Harvard. When a family is assigned a suite with lead paint on the walls, Yard Operations have to delead the entire suite before the family can move in.
Proctor families are not guaranteed the best suites on campus either. The FDO considers factors such as a proctor’s seniority and the quality of his or her work, according to Elm Yard Resident Dean Sue Brown. Page and Sky, who have been proctors for nine and five years respectively, are now living in suites that include a kitchen and a private bathroom.
Newer proctor couples are not always that lucky.
Emily S. Lin ’02 is a proctor for the first time this year. She lives in Canaday C with her wife Dawn E Slack, who is expecting a baby this spring. They share a bathroom with the rest of their floor, cook in Canaday’s common kitchen, and wash the dishes in their bath tub.
Lin and Slack say they hope they are going to be assigned to a suite better suited to their needs next year, but in the meantime they are prepared to raise a baby in a world of freshmen.

Faculty members expressed favor for a proposal to rename the Department of Sanskrit and Indian Studies the Department of South Asian Studies as of July 1. The proposal, conceived this April, also involves incorporating faculty members from other departments in pursuit of a more interdisciplinary approach to the study of the subcontinent.
Under the reconfiguration, the department hopes to draw more scholars whose work may not have fit well under the previous department structure and maintain its emphasis on language studies.
“This represents the coming together of social science and humanities,” Anthropology Professor Arthur M. Kleinman said in support of the decision.
“It is a way of creating a stronger and broader platform for both undergraduate studies especially and for graduate studies,” said Diana L. Eck, the department’s current chair.
According to Eck, Sanskrit and Indian Studies has already started talking with professors in other areas who might work in the new department.
“I think that we have already a great number of people whose intellectual energy is gathered behind this proposal,” Eck said.
She added it is “quite clear that we certainly have the energy in this university to create a department that is worthy of the rich culture of South Asia.”
The faculty also spent significant time discussing Dean of Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith’s report on the progress of Teaching and Learning—which focuses on improving the instructional framework—in FAS.
Smith emphasized his ambition to establish the University’s reputation as an “undisputed leader in pedagogical and curricular excellence.”
“It is time again to take a big leap forward,” Smith said.
Smith addressed the Compact on Teaching and Learning, which was published in 2007, as one of the early components of this initiative.
The Compact reengineered the tenure-track faculty hiring process to include professors who had shown “research and teaching excellence” and moved to establish more communal celebrations of good teaching through, for example, award-giving.
Reporting on the project’s progress over the past three years, Smith particularly stressed developing the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences curriculum—such as instructing graduate students teaching techniques and administering English classes to graduate students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As students spend reading period writing papers, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences got together to write a paper of their own, and it was not easy.
In yesterday’s faculty meeting, English Department Chair W. James Simpson reported on the progress of a two-page statement from FAS about the upcoming University-wide capital campaign.
The document, which FAS Dean Michael D. Smith asked Simpson to draft in broad consultation with faculty, alumni, and donors, will hopefully “define the promises and challenges of a research university with a college of liberal arts at its heart.”
Simpson admitted in the faculty meeting that speaking for hundreds of people in a two-to-three page report is “difficult” and “impossible.”
“You will have noticed that I’m lowering expectations,” Simpson said, “but as expectations have been duly lowered, this has turned out to be very rewarding work.”
PUTTING A STAMP ON SUMMER
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences approved a list of courses in the preliminary plan for next year’s Harvard Summer School yesterday, but this was not the only important thing on Summer School Dean Donald H. Pfister’s mind at the faculty meeting.
Next year marks the 140th session of the Harvard Summer School and the 200th anniversary of its founder, then natural history professor Asa Gray, Pfister told the faculty members before he moved on to the agenda items.
In 1871, after Harvard extended the summer session into 13 weeks, Gray started a summer botany course for teachers, making Harvard Summer School one of the earliest summer academic sessions established in the United States.
According to Pfister, Gray will be memorialized with a new stamp soon to be issued by the U.S. Postal Service.
PASSAGE TO SOUTH ASIA
The FAS officially approved the proposal introduced in April to change the name of the Department of Sanskrit and Indian Studies to the Department of South Asian Studies yesterday. But not before department chair Diana L. Eck delivered an emotional speech on the history of the department to faculty members.
“When I first came to the university, the department was located in Widener Library in a Faculty Study,” Eck said. Over the following decades, the department relocated multiple times, to locations including Grays Hall, Phillips Brooks House, Church Street, and 2 Divinity Ave.
“Now we’re above Dunkin’ Donuts at 2 Bow Street,” Eck said.
She also briefly commented on structural changes in the department during the hundred years since the first Sanskrit class at Harvard in 1872.
Since then, the department has undergone several name changes. The two most recent took place in 1902 and 1951 respectively, reflecting the addition and subtraction of South Asian languages offered at the University.

Social Studies Director of Studies Anya Bernstein and Chair of the Committee of Degrees in Social Studies Richard Tuck informed faculty and students about future use of the controversial Martin Peretz Fund yesterday afternoon.
The presentation and subsequent forum, which was attended by many of the departmental tutors and about a dozen social studies concentrators, followed the department’s announcement in September that it would set up an undergraduate research fund to honor Martin “Marty” H. Peretz. The proposed fund had sparked much controversy as many said Peretz had a 30-year history of issuing hateful language towards blacks, Latinos, Arabs, and Muslims.
Bernstein announced yesterday the money from the fund, totaling $650,000 in donations from Peretz’s friends and family, will be available for use starting next calendar year.
Bernstein told audience members 90 percent of the funds will be devoted to juniors pursuing thesis research, with priority given to social or political theorists and those studying either multiculturalism, social justice, or inequality.
The remaining 10 percent, Bernstein said, will be set apart for small start-up research grants of about $250-500 each.
Social Studies concentrators who apply through the Harvard College Research Program will either receive grants from the Peretz fund or from the pool of money already available for thesis research in the department.
HCRP awards are typically capped around $1500, and the Peretz fund has no such constraint at this time, Bernstein said.
Bernstein also emphasized only HCRP administrators, Tuck, and herself would know who chose to take grants from the Peretz fund. This arrangement was the result of a compromise after controversy over the Peretz fund culminated in protests from college and graduate school students and a student walk-out in the class Social Studies 10.
“I’ve heard from students across the spectrum: students who are opposed to this money and students who have contacted me, sometimes privately, who would like to use this money but are afraid of being ostracized if their use of it becomes public,” said Bernstein. “What we want to do is set up an arrangement that respects everybody’s preferences, to the extent that that is possible.”
Some students, however, remained skeptical of the plans for using the fund.
“It doesn’t change the fact that it’s still wrong,” Melissa J. Barber ’13 said, pointing out the decision to add the Peretz money to current research funds instead of pulling back existing funding was an “implicit acknowledgement” of wrongdoing on the part of the department.
Both Tuck and Bernstein denied that the arrangement was indicative the fund’s moral ambiguity.
“The same question would have come up had this fund been made in honor of Martin Luther King,” Tuck said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the campus puts its collective nose to the grindstone in preparation for the start of finals, this term’s work has already begun to pay off for many Harvard student-athletes.
Ten Crimson athletes earned Academic All-Ivy honors this fall, according to an announcement made by Ancient Eight officials yesterday.
Leading the way for Harvard teams, with two honorees apiece, are football, women’s soccer, women’s volleyball, and sailing.
Football captain Colin Zych and senior wide receiver Zar Zavala were selected, as were junior forward Melanie Baskind and senior forward Katherine Sheeleigh of women’s soccer.
Women’s volleyball junior co-captain Anne Carroll Ingersoll and classmate middle blocker Sandra Lynne Fryhofer were also honored on this year’s list of selections in addition to junior Alexandra Jumper and senior Alan Palmer of the sailing team.
Men’s cross-country and men’s water polo were also represented, as senior distance runner Daniel Chenoweth and water polo co-captain Bret Voith garnered the same accolade.
Baskind, Chenoweth, Sheeleigh, and Zych were also members of the Academic All-Ivy team last fall.
Each college in the Ancient Eight is given the opportunity to nominate five men and five women to receive this distinction as each term draws to a close. Nominees must maintain a GPA of at least a 3.0 and be a starter or “key reserve” for their respective varsity team.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s basketball team was competitive for only the first seven minutes of the game last night against Florida before the Gators chomped at the Crimson’s small lead and cruised to an 86-65 victory at the Stephen C. O’Connell Center in Gainesville, Fla.
Though each team had four players in double figures, Florida (9-2) had a scoring outburst from its bench, which tallied 51 points. The starters for the Crimson (4-3) did most of its work—though junior guard Brogan Berry chipped in 15 points off the bench—but they ultimately were not able to overcome a lead that reached as many as 33 points.
“It was a pretty disappointing outcome for our team,” Berry said. “We really had been working hard in practice and trying to improve on the little things…It didn’t quite show [yesterday]…We had a good push in the second half, but it was too late for us to come back and win.”
The Gators were coming off a 56-50 loss against a different Ivy League foe, Brown, on Sunday. In that game, Florida had its worst shooting display of the season (30.6 percent from the field), but the Gators bounced back nicely against Harvard, hitting 49.2 percent of their shots—a season-high.
The Crimson was once again erratic in its shooting, as it finished with a 39.3 field-goal percentage. Harvard has alternated wins and losses for the past six games, and each time the Crimson has lost, it’s been due to poor shooting.
“Unfortunately, we’ve had a rollercoaster season so far,” Berry said. “We struggle with finding consistency in our game, and it often comes with shooting. If we don’t make our shots, we get out of [our rhythm]—we get into a funk. I think we just need to change our mindset from offensive scoring to [being] more of a defensive team.”
Florida won the jump ball to start the game, but it was Harvard who scored first off a jumper by sophomore forward Victoria Lippert. The two teams exchanged baskets early on, resulting in three lead changes. But two three pointers from co-captain Christine Matera and two free throws by freshman guard Christine Clark helped the Crimson take a 12-10 lead with 13:30 left on the clock.
From there on out, Florida dominated, slowly increasing its lead as the first period progressed. The Gators’ Jennifer George scored on a layup, and guard Brittany Shine hit two consecutive three pointers to make the score 24-17 with nine minutes left to play. Shine led both teams with 16 points on the night, while George was second on the team with 14 points.
Florida went on a 17-7 run in the final five minutes of the first half to keep Harvard at bay. The Crimson went into locker room at halftime down by 16 points, 43-27.
“Gradually over the first half, we started to give them the ball,” Matera said. “We let them have too much possession off of turnovers and offensive rebounds when our shots weren’t falling on offense, and our defense wasn’t making up for that either.”
The Gators opened the second half by hitting a jumper, and then guard Jones Jordan stole the ball from Lippert, which led to another score. Florida had 11 steals on the night, and Jordan was one of two players with three steals.
“During this game, we tried to go quicker than our pace would allow us,” Berry said. “In the quick and frantic play of the game, we didn’t take care of the ball…We didn’t alter our game quick enough, and they were able to take advantage of our lazy passes and got the easy points.”
The lead hovered around 20 points for the first half of the second period but it ballooned to 30 when Shine made a layup off a fast break with 9:43 left to play in the game. Harvard senior Claire Wheeler made a jumper, but Florida’s Kayla Lewis responded with a trey. Wheeler then fouled Lanita Bartley, whose free throws increased the deficit to 33 points.
The Crimson spent the rest of the contest chipping away at the lead. A fast break layup by Berry cut the score to 82-64 with 2:14 on the clock, but that’s the closest Harvard would get. Several free throws extended the Gator’s lead, and the Crimson fell to its third loss of the season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Worcester Polytechnic Institute—a Division III program—came into Lavietes Pavilion last night and gave the Harvard men’s basketball team all it could handle for 40 minutes.
After building an early 13-3 lead, the Crimson (6-2) essentially played the Engineers (5-2) evenly throughout the rest of the contest, ultimately winning 69-54 over the visitors.
“I was disappointed in how we played, but I have to give [WPI] credit for putting us in that position,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
The Crimson built its early lead thanks to some sharp shooting from its backcourt. Junior co-captain Oliver McNally hit two threes from the left wing and sophomore guard Christian Webster nailed a triple of his own in the first five minutes. With a pair of Webster free throws and a long two from junior forward Andrew Van Nest, Harvard built a 10-point advantage in the opening six minutes.
At that point, Amaker inserted his second unit, and the lead began to evaporate. The Crimson committed three turnovers in less than two minutes, and WPI cut the margin to 16-9.
“I wanted to play a lot of guys,”  Amaker said. “I was disappointed in those guys during that stretch. We turned it over repeatedly and gave them life.”
Although Amaker sent his starters back in the game, Harvard was not able to recover its rhythm. A steal and a breakaway dunk by Van Nest made the score 30-15, but 15 points would be the biggest lead of the half. Following Van Nest’s jam, a turnover by Curry led to an easy layup for Engineer center Matt Carr, and teammate Ben Etten followed that bucket by burying a wide-open three.
At halftime, the Crimson led 38-25 due largely to its success from deep. Fifteen of Harvard’s 22 shot attempts were three-pointers, of which it converted eight. The Crimson’s leading scorer coming into the game, junior co-captain Keith Wright, scored no points in the opening frame as WPI chose to swarm the center each time he caught the ball. The strategy opened up many of Harvard’s outside looks.
“I thought we had good ball movement,”  Amaker said.
At the start of the second half, the Engineers made a run. A three-pointer by guard Jeffrey Robinson and a lay-in by Carr cut the Crimson’s lead to eight points. But Wright responded with a hook shot—his first points of the contest—and McNally reeled off seven straight points for Harvard on four free throws and a trey.
WPI cut the lead to eight once again with 11:02 remaining, but McNally hit a pair of free throws to extended the advantage to double digits. The junior led all scorers on the night with 20 points.
“Jeremy [Lin ’10] left, so a lot of the things he did—scoring, assists, defense—it’s all on everybody’s shoulders,” McNally said. “This game, I just found some good opportunities to score the ball.”
The Crimson was never able to build an advantage greater than 15 points, as Robinson and Engineer guard Jaimie Shannon had an answer for each Harvard surge. The duo combined for 27 points, eight assists, and four rebounds on the night.
“I thought they played a very scrappy, hard-nosed game,” Amaker said of WPI. “They have a very good program, a very good culture of winning.”
Ultimately, Harvard was able to use solid free throw shooting to prevent the upset. The Crimson went 28 of 34 from the line, including 20 of 25 in the second half, en route to prevailing, 69-54.
Harvard ended with four players scoring in double-digits—McNally, Webster, Curry, and Wright with 20, 17, 11, and 10, respectively.
“I thought we tried hard,”  Amaker said. “It was no question that we [did not] take anyone lightly or didn’t come to play. Sometimes you don’t play as well as you want, and you give credit to the other team.”
“We didn’t come with the necessary defensive intensity, and that just led to us playing not well in pretty much every facet of the game,” McNally said. “We haven’t played well a couple games in a row…We need to change that going into a really big game [against Boston University] this weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard freshman Laurent Rivard received a rude welcome to college basketball. In his Crimson debut this November, the highly touted guard struggled mightily to find his rhythm, shooting 0-of-11 from the field and committing two turnovers.
“I was a little nervous,” said Rivard, who finished with two points off a pair of free throws.
After the disappointing contest came to a close, Rivard received a message on his phone from an unexpected supporter—former Harvard standout and current member of the Golden State Warriors Jeremy Lin ’10.
“Jeremy told me not to worry about it—that he had a game like that too,” Rivard said. “I thought that was really nice of him to do that. It helped my confidence.”
If the Crimson’s past two contests are any indication, Rivard has certainly taken Lin’s advice to heart. In Harvard’s two matchups last week, Rivard looked like the player that some media outlets projected to take home Ivy League Rookie of the Year honors. In the two contests, Rivard led all Crimson players with a combined 36 points, netting a total of 10 three-pointers on just 17 attempts.
For his success, Rivard was named the Ivy League Rookie of the Week, making him the first Crimson player to take home the award this season.
After his early struggles, Rivard has settled in nicely to his role as a spot-up shooter in Harvard’s inside-out offense, making opposing defenses pay when they double-team the Crimson’ big men.
“Teams are respecting [junior forward Keith Wright] a lot this year and doubling down,” sophomore forward Kyle Casey said. “With good shooters out on the perimeter, it makes us multi-dimensional.”
While in week two sophomore Christian Webster got hot from deep, this past week it was Rivard’s turn to shine.
In last Wednesday’s 80-57 win over Fordham, Rivard led all scorers with a career-high 21 points, shooting five-of-eight from beyond the arc. After scoring just four points in the first half, Rivard began to make it rain, sinking all five of his treys in the second half.
During one seven-minute stretch, Rivard made four consecutive three-pointers, helping Harvard’s lead grow to 27 with 5:31 to play.
Rivard’s teammates were not surprised by his offensive outburst.
“He’s a great shooter, so he’s doing what we expect him to do,” Casey said.
Rivard’s hot hand traveled with the team to Ann Arbor, Mich., for the Crimson’s matchup with Michigan last Saturday. While Harvard finished on the losing end of the 65-62 decision, Rivard managed to anchor the Crimson with a number of crucial three-pointers.
After the Wolverines cut Harvard’s lead to two with less than four minutes to play in the first half, Rivard stuck a three from the left corner to put the Crimson up, 25-20. Two minutes later, Rivard gave Harvard its largest lead of the first half, sinking another trey off a pass from junior co-captain Oliver McNally to take the nine-point advantage.
“My teammates did a good job finding me,” Rivard said. “I just took shots when I was open.”
When the Crimson surrendered the lead midway through the second period, Rivard helped the visitors remain within striking distance. Rivard ended a 19-1 Michigan run with 12:25 to play, cutting the Wolverines’ lead to six off a deep ball from the right corner.
“Laurent did hit some big threes,” Casey said. “That was a good cancellation three to keep our spirits up.”
Rivard finished with two more three-pointers on the night for a total of 15 points during a career-high 33 minutes of playing time.
The rookie benefitted from Harvard coach Tommy Amaker’s decision to go with a smaller lineup, as he shared the court with fellow guards McNally, Webster, and sophomore Brandyn Curry for the majority of the contest to matchup with Michigan’s talented backcourt.
“I like [the small lineup] a lot,” Rivard said. “All the guards are good shooters so the defense can’t really focus on one player. It’s easier to move the ball and get open shots.”
Just seven games into his collegiate career, Rivard still feels he has room to improve before his freshman campaign comes to a close. The rookie would like to work on his ability to attack the basket, but recognizes his value as a spot-up shooter in the Crimson’s current system.
“I know Brandyn and Oliver are really good playmakers, so I leave it to them,” Rivard said. “I just embrace my role.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Whether to escape the cold or to hit the books, everyone’s been spending a lot of time indoors as of late, and Ivy League sports teams are no exception. Hockey’s well underway, with two Ancient Eight squads leading the way nationally. And in basketball, the Ivy League is trying to continue its new tradition of upsetting big teams. Don’t worry, we’ll explain everything in our weekly chat around the water cooler.
This year, men’s hockey just isn’t Harvard’s game. The squad hasn’t taken home a “W” since Nov. 12, and since that time, the Crimson has been outscored, 25-10. Consequently, Harvard now finds itself at the bottom of the ECAC standings, ranked 11th out of the 12 teams. And the competition won’t get any easier tonight, as the Crimson faces off against No. 18 Quinnipiac, which found the back of the net five times in its last match against Harvard.
But while the Crimson is struggling, other Ivy League teams are ripping it up, as Yale, Princeton, and Dartmouth round out the top three teams in the ECAC. In fact, the Bulldogs are, for the first time in school history, the top-ranked team in the nation. In this week’s poll, Yale slipped past former No. 1 Minnesota-Duluth to claim the top spot, and with good reason: off to their strongest start in 81 years, the Bulldogs have only dropped one contest so far and have yet to score less than three goals in a game.
Things might get ugly when Harvard and Yale face off in Cambridge on Jan. 8. The Bulldogs beat the Big Green, 7-3, and Dartmouth has beaten the Crimson by scores of 8-2 and 5-2. You do the math.
On the women’s side, Cornell holds the top spot in the ECAC, with Harvard fourth in the conference and Yale a distant eighth. Voted the top team in the country, the Big Red has made it look easy so far. In 12 of the team’s 14 contests, the women from Ithaca have limited their opponent to one goal or fewer. But the Big Red’s defense isn’t the whole story, as the team has averaged 4.4 goals per game. This shouldn’t come as a total surprise, though, as Cornell nearly won the national championship last year.
While no top rankings are coming for the men’s basketball teams of the Ivy League, the conference certainly has risen in esteem in the past few years, highlighted of course by Cornell’s run in the 2010 Big Dance. The upward trend seems to be continuing this year. Harvard nearly (and probably should have) upset Michigan last weekend, blowing a large lead at half time to fall, 65-62. And tonight, Penn has a chance to topple a big team of its own, as it faces off against No. 12 Villanova at home. A win would be a huge boost for the Quakers, who have already nearly equaled last year’s win total, but the odds are against them. Villanova might just be too good.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the last weekend before many ECAC squads break for the holidays, only two teams—Cornell and Quinnipiac—really got in the holiday spirit. But the biggest gainer in this week’s edition of the power rankings? That would be Colgate, who rode an eight-goal outburst all the way to...a weekend split. Such is life in ECAC Hockey. Let’s see who’s moving towards the top of Santa’s list and who’s doomed to get coal in their stockings.
1. Cornell (13-1-0, 8-0-0 ECAC, 1st in conference)
The Big Red held onto its No. 1 spot in the national polls after beating Syracuse, St. Lawrence, and Clarkson by an aggregate 10-2 count last week. Cornell hasn’t allowed more than a goal in a game since a Nov. 2 overtime loss to Mercyhurst.
2. Quinnipiac (13-6-1, 6-5, 2nd)
The Bobcats vaulted into second place in the ECAC with a pair of dominant wins over Yale and Brown. Freshman Kelly Babstock set the single-season program goals record last weekend (yes, that’s right, in the first weekend of December) when she netted her 16th tally of the season, earning her conference player of the week honors.
3. St. Lawrence (8-7-2, 4-3-0, 7th)
The Saints got a puck past Cornell goaltender Amanda Mazzotta last weekend, which is an accomplishment in and of itself. St. Lawrence’s 5-3 win over Colgate on Saturday gives it some momentum heading into a tough series with No. 3 Mercyhurst this weekend.
4. Dartmouth (6-4-0, 5-3-0, t-3rd)
Dartmouth had the weekend off, but in a conference where pretty much nobody is playing particularly well, the Big Green actually moves up a spot from last week. Dartmouth jumps back in on Saturday for a date with its in-state rival, New Hampshire, which is having an uncharacteristically down year.
5. Harvard (4-5-2, 4-2-2, t-3rd)
No. 6 Boston College’s pair of Olympians, Kelli Stack and Molly Schaus, dominated the Crimson in a 6-2 beatdown on Sunday, proving Harvard’s young defense still has a long way to go. Things don’t get any easier this weekend, with No. 5 Boston University coming to Bright on Friday night.
6. Yale (4-8-2, 3-4-1, t-8th)
The Bulldogs may have dropped their rematch with in-state rival Quinnipiac, but a 2-1 win over Ivy foe Princeton moves ever-improving Yale up into a tie with Clarkson for the crucial eighth spot in the conference standings. Netminder Jackee Snikeris is coming into her own, now second in the ECAC behind Mazzotta in save percentage.
7. Colgate (6-12-0, 3-5-0, 10th)
The Raiders scored more goals last weekend—eight—than any other team in the ECAC, led by Rachel Walsh’s three-score performance. But Colgate will have to be more consistent in 2011 if it wants to move up into playoff contention.
8. Princeton (4-10-1, 4-6-1, t-5th)
A date with lowly Brown was just what the doctor ordered for the Tigers, as Princeton snapped its five-game losing streak with a 4-0 shutout of the Bears on Saturday. Rookie forward Olivia Mucha came away with a pair of third-period goals, including the first shorthanded goal of her career, and she now leads the team in points with nine.
9. Rensselaer (6-8-5, 4-3-1, t-5th)
This was supposed to be an easy two-win weekend for the Engineers. Instead, they just barely escaped with a 3-3 tie on Saturday. Back to the drawing board.
10. Union (1-12-2, 0-6-2, 12th)
Union moves up a few spots this week after earning a tie against fifth-place Rensselaer, doubling its point total in the conference standings. The Dutchwomen nearly had their first conference win of the season, but an Engineer power-play goal with 12 seconds left in the third left them settling for the draw.
11. Clarkson (6-10-3, 3-3-1, t-8th)
The Golden Knights were riding the struggle bus weekend, squandering an early 2-0 lead to Colgate on Friday before getting blanked by Cornell, 3-0, on Saturday. That means Clarkson hasn’t scored in nearly 110 minutes of ice time, giving up eight goals in the meantime.
12. Brown (2-8-2, 1-5-2, 11th)
Not only did the Bears get swept this weekend, they failed to score a goal in a pair of 4-0 losses. Brown does get a break, as the squad won’t play again until Jan. 2, but four of its first six games in January are against teams currently ranked in the top five nationally. Ouch.

Have you ever wondered what Harvard exams were like centuries ago? Though one might expect that these exams have been lost to the ages, they have, in fact, been collected in the depths of Pusey Library. In order to uncover the sort of questions Harvard students had to answer as they sat for exams in the past, this Flyby correspondent ventured into the Harvard University Archives, looked through exams dating back to around 150 years ago, and compiled some of the more interesting questions below.Let’s see how you would do if you were at Harvard back then:
 
Question One: Know your history (1858)
"Name the Sovereigns of England from William the Conqueror to Victoria, with the date of each accession, the right of each Sovereign to the Crown, and his relationship to his immediate predecessor. Point out the Several Lines and Houses."
Question Two: Be a student of rhetoric (1860)
"Distinguish the Unnatural and the Improbably: Matters of Fact and Matters of Opinion."
Question Three: The Classics are everything (1860)
"Translate into Latin—Ignorance of future evils is more useful than knowledge [of them]."
Question Four: You might have to steer a ship (1860)
"Draw the triangle of Middle Latitude Sailing, and give the names of the sides and angles."
Question Five: Math (1860) 
"What is the square root of 104.8576?"
Question Six: Ancient Ec10 (1860)
"What is the laissez-faire principle, and what are the limitations of it? Show that these exceptions only confirm the rule."
Want to see more questions from decades past? Old exams can be viewed in the Harvard University Archives. Details on how to access these exams are found here.

If the cold and dreary weather has you feeling down, you should check out the recently opened “Happy Room,” the beach-themed break room in the basement of Pforzheimer House.  Christine S. Woodward, a Pforzheimer House tutor and a California native, said she designed the room as a place for students to escape from the cold Cambridge weather.
“[The weather] really has an effect on people, and I don’t think that people are aware of that,” Woodward said.  “It weighs on people, and people don’t understand how much not getting out can affect them and their happiness.”
The walls of the room are decorated with jumbo-sized murals of seaside scenes. Multi-colored paper lights hang from the ceiling, and plastic beach and bean-bag chairs furnish the space. Although the room opened this past Saturday, Woodward said it is still a work in progress.  She has a number of other  improvements planned for the future, such as adding a sound machine to  simulate the sound of waves.
Woodward, an architect and engineer designer by trade, said that she   had no specific reason for choosing the room’s beach theme.
“I don’t really know why the beach,” she said, “but the beach makes   me happy.”
The creation of the “Happy Room” is part of a larger initiative to revitalize the Pfoho basement.  Other proposed projects include allowing student artists to paint the basement’s walls and the creation of a room specifically for young children living in the Quad.
While the room is relatively small in size, Woodward assures us that it’s worth the trip. “You get a better experience when you see it for yourself,” she said.

At 12:20 p.m. today, what was a seemingly ordinary lunch in Annenberg erupted into a veritable dance party, thanks to the students in the freshman seminar “Movement and Meaning: Dance, Culture, and Identity in the 20th Century.” For his final project in the class, Michael Lai ’14 organized a flashmob that featured over 100 people in a surprise choreographed dance.
After overcoming “administrative hurdles” so that the dancers could use Annenberg Hall without repercussions, Lai posted a video of the dance on YouTube. He asked his classmates to pass it onto friends so that they could learn the dance in preparation for today’s event.
"I’ve always wanted to do a flashmob," said Lai. "I actually wrote in my seminar applications that I wanted to start a flashmob."

As the Cambridge weather nears freezing and our workloads call for all-nighters, one thing remains constant in nearly every Harvard student’s diet: the burrito. In this mini-series, we’ll be posting detailed reviews and rankings of grilled chicken burritos from four different establishments (Boloco, Chipotle, Qdoba, and Felipe’s), judging on criteria ranging from temperature to tortilla thickness. By the end, we hope to have made the lives of inebriated wanderers and starving studiers a little easier, while offering an easy tool for Reading Period procrastination—burrito rankings.
 
Burrito #4: Felipe’s super grilled chicken burrito
Includes: Chicken, salsa, black beans, rice, cheese, tortilla.
-50 points for charging 45 cents for sour cream.
Price: $5.00
+1,000,000 points for understanding the penny-pinching student’s plight: this burrito is cheaper than every other by more than a dollar.
Weight: 1 lb, 5 oz.
+300 points for heft.
Tortilla: Pretty flavorless, but less chewy than the others. Neither delicious nor atrocious.
Neutral.
Rice: So much flavor. So much moistness. So, so, so good.
+1,000 points for being the only establishment to succeed in this category.
Guacamole: $.85
+300 points for the cheapest guac yet.
Chicken: Juicy and flavorful.
+1,000,000 for getting chicken right.
Cheese: Melted. Perfect.
+1,000,000 for actually melting the cheese, which went perfectly with the rice and the tortilla.
Extras: Many: five flavors of salsa, chipotle marinated onions, pickled carrots, radishes, jalapenos, key limes, cilantro, and onions.
+500 for a huge selection of free sauces and sides.
Hours of operation: 11 a.m. to 12 a.m. Sunday through Wednesday; 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. Thursday through Saturday
+1,000,000 for being open—and bustling—late at night, when you’re looking to satisfy drunk cravings while seeing everyone you know.
Deals and steals: None, it seems.
-50 points—we probably deserve something free for all of the business we provide.
 
The bottom line: Felipe’s offered the only truly fantastic eating experience. The cheese was melted, as it should be, and the burrito-maker mixed the ingredients thoroughly—every bite included every flavor. Another perk? Felipe’s smaller grilled chicken burritos are only $3.90 each. The glory of Felipe’s has never been a secret among Harvard students—as evidenced every Saturday night—but it is now official that its burritos are the best.
Total points: 4,002,000
Final Ranking: 1/4
