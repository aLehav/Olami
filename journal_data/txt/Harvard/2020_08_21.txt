After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will resume its search for four faculty specializing in ethnic studies and create two annual visiting professorships in the field, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay announced in a Thursday morning email to FAS affiliates.
The announcement comes roughly four months after Gay suspended the high-profile search due to the coronavirus pandemic, a move she then called “heart-breaking” and “disheartening.” The search committee unanimously agreed at the time that candidates would no longer be able to best present their work.
Gay originally launched the search for three to four senior faculty specializing in Asian American, Latinx, and Muslim studies in June 2019, with a plan to complete the cluster hire by the end of the 2019-2020 academic year. When the pandemic overturned life on campus and put the search on hiatus, two candidates had already visited Harvard to give talks and meet with faculty and students, and nine more were scheduled to visit later in the spring semester.
Harvard affiliates have lobbied for a formalized ethnic studies program for nearly five decades, and the announcement of the search followed months of student organizing after the departure of two tenure-track faculty specializing in Asian American studies. In November, the University’s decision to deny tenure to Romance Languages and Literatures associate professor Lorgia García Peña — who studies race and ethnicity — led to further student protests and drew widespread attention to the search.
Gay also announced a series of other diversity iniatitives in the FAS in her Thursday missive, including the launch of a task force on visual culture and signage led by Arts and Humanities Dean Robin E. Kelsey, and the appointment of an FAS associate dean for Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging.
The new dean will report directly to Gay and will “develop concrete goals and identify personal, departmental, divisional, and school-level actions for building an effective and active culture of anti-racism in the FAS,” Gay wrote.
FAS will also “identify concrete steps we can take to increase racial diversity of senior staff” and expand the Inequality in America postdoctoral fellowship program from two to four scholars studying racial and ethnic inequality.
Gay wrote that the moves were spurred on by the nationwide reckoning on racial justice following the murder of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police in May, noting her “personal commitment to this transformational project.”
“This moment offers a profound opportunity for institutional change that should not and cannot be squandered,” Gay wrote. “In raw, candid conversations and virtual gatherings convened across the FAS in the aftermath of George Floyd’s brutal murder, members of our community spoke forcefully and with searing clarity about the institution we aspire to be and the lengths we still must travel to be the Harvard of our ideals.”
“It is up to us to ensure that the pain expressed, problems identified, and solutions suggested set us on a path for long-term change,” she added.
Gay wrote that Thursday’s steps were “just a starting place” in advancing racial justice in the FAS.
“The work of racial justice is not a one-time project,” she wrote. “We must be relentless, constructively critical, and action-oriented in our pursuit to build the thriving, more equitable FAS we all deserve.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard established a petition process for “rare” exceptions to its prohibition on domestic and international travel — measure which it has extended “until further notice,” according to an email Thursday from administrators.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp, and Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen’s message comes as the prohibition on all University-related travel enters its third month.
“We understand that members of our community may need to travel for work that is directly and immediately related to the COVID-19 pandemic or that enables critical research activity,” the trio of administrators wrote.
They added that they expect exceptions will be “rare.”
The Office of the Vice Provost for International Affairs will administer the petition process, which will be available to faculty, postdoctoral fellows, doctoral students, and staff for “travel only of the utmost urgency,” per the email.
It does not apply to students and staff who have already been approved to return to Cambridge and Boston and must travel to do so.
Students and staff who are traveling to Massachusetts must adhere to the Massachusetts Travel Order, which mandates that travelers entering the state complete the Massachusetts Travel Form and quarantine for 14 days or present a negative coronavirus test administered up to 72 hours prior to arrival. Failure to do so subjects travelers to a $500 fine.
Harvard students and personnel living on campus will receive three tests a week, while affiliates who work on campus non-residentially will be tested once or twice a week. Testing frequency for the latter group will depend on their activities and the amount of time they spend on campus.
Garber, Lapp, and Nguyen also wrote that they “continue to strongly discourage personal travel, both international and domestic.”
“Because there is so much uncertainty about the future course of the pandemic, we plan to keep travel to a minimum until conditions change,” they wrote.

The Cambridge Ordinance Committee voted Wednesday evening to recommend an affordable housing overlay zoning petition to the Cambridge City Council.
The Ordinance Committee voted 6-1-1 in favor of recommending the overlay to the City Council. This vote comes on the heels of the Cambridge Planning Board’s vote to recommend the overlay to the entire council in early August.
The overlay — a key issue in the last election cycle — will allow affordable housing developers to compete with market rates by streamlining the permitting process for units that are deemed 100 percent affordable.
The overlay, which was dropped in 2019 when first brought before the Ordinance Committee, will now proceed in front of the entire City Council before it can be officially adopted.
Councilor and former Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern, a strong proponent of the overlay, said in an interview with The Crimson that many amendments were made to the overlay between its first proposal and its recommendation by the Ordinance Committee to the entire City Council.
“There were, with the amendments that we passed tonight, close to 50 amendments, the majority of which were filed by councilors who oppose the overlay,” McGovern said. “That shows a willingness from those of us who support the overlay to try and reach a compromise, try to include some things in the overlay that weren't what we supported in hopes that it would help people feel better about passing the overlay.”
McGovern, along with Councilor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler, Councilor E. Denise Simmons, and Councilor Timothy J. Toomey Jr., sponsored the proposal to re-introduce the overlay after the initial proposal was dropped in 2019. In his statement Wednesday evening in front of the Planning Board, McGovern said he still believes the overlay accomplishes its founding goals.
“I truly believe that this ordinance will accomplish two very important goals, one being to make the building of one hundred percent affordable housing for lower and middle-income residents more financially viable, and two, bring affordable housing to parts of the city where it is currently lacking.” McGovern said. “I believed that when this was first filed, and I believe that tonight.”
McGovern concluded while he is optimistic the overlay zoning petition will ultimately be passed by the entire City Council in October, he does not believe the city’s work to develop affordable housing ends with its passage.
“This is one more tool in our toolbox to address our affordable housing crisis, but not one ordinance is going to solve everything,” McGovern said. “But this is Cambridge stepping forward to take the lead on a very important issue and to come up with a creative way to address this crisis, and I'm proud of that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Professor Scott V. Edwards ’86 dipped his bike tires in the Pacific Ocean at Oregon’s Sunset Beach Thursday afternoon, completing a solo, cross-country bicycle journey that began on the Massachusetts coast June 6.
Edwards celebrated the feat with a live stream for the more than 11,000 Twitter followers he amassed over the course of the trip.
“It's just hard to believe I’ve actually done it,” he said in an interview Thursday afternoon. “I think the moral of the story is many small steps made for big leaps — I can't believe that I've cycled so far.”
“All the different kinds of people I met and situations I was in and landscapes — it’s a really great way to see the country,” he said. “I would recommend it for anyone.”
In the live stream, he added he was touched by the “amazing acts of kindness from lots of people” over the 3,200-mile journey.
“It gave me a lot of hope for the country, really it did,” he said.
Edwards’s long-planned trip came to be shaped by the twin events that defined summer 2020 in the United States: the coronavirus pandemic and protests for racial justice following the murder of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police.
Edwards, who is Black, said the protests gave his trip deeper meaning as he used the attention he received to champion causes such as Black Lives Matter and diversifying the sciences.
This summer’s racial justice protests were in part sparked by an incident close to Edwards’s work in avian biology and position as curator of Harvard’s ornithology collections. On May 25, the same day police killed Floyd, a white woman in New York’s Central Park called police on Black birdwatcher Christian F. Cooper ’84. Cooper’s video of the incident went viral and sparked the creation of Black Birders Week, which Edwards helped champion.
Though Edwards said he had decided to make the trip before the Central Park incident, it inspired him to join Twitter, where his frequent tweets about bird sightings and his experiences as an African-American man in nature quickly gained attention among ornithologists. He frequently labels his tweets with #BlackBirdersWeek, #BlackInNature, or #BlackLivesMatter.
In late June, Edwards set up a GoFundMe to collect donations for initiatives to diversify the field of evolutionary biology. With the social media attention from his ride, the fund had raised over $56,000 as of Thursday.
Within a few days of setting out, Edwards also affixed Black Lives Matter signs to his bike.
“It's generated a lot of conversations that I probably wouldn’t have had without the signs on my bike,” Edwards said.
Edwards said he has encountered a few racist comments over the course of his trip, which he chronicled on Twitter. On June 26, an 84-year-old white man in Monroeville, Ind. told Edwards that “blacks got here when God ran out of white paint,” Edwards tweeted. Three days later, a campground turned him away because of his Black Lives Matter sign.
He tweeted July 25 that he removed the signs for periods of the trip, noting that he found it “tough enough being a lone black man” in certain states.
However, Edwards said he has appreciated the conversations he has had with many people during the journey, particularly in America’s conservative heartland.
“It’s always interesting to hear why people think and lean politically the way they do,” he said. “I think it's really important to listen to those sorts of perspectives.”
Edwards said he would typically spend the summer doing fieldwork in countries such as Mongolia with his graduate students, but with international travel curtailed by the pandemic, he seized the opportunity to take the trip he had hoped to make for years.
“I always wanted to go cross-country — it’s a good way to see the country and see the landscapes,” he said. “As COVID came around, all my summer activities were being canceled and I said, ‘Well, this is a good time.’”
He set off June 6 from Newburyport, Mass., dipping his tires in the Atlantic Ocean. He averaged around 50 to 60 miles per day, passing through 15 states and several mountain ranges, including the Rockies.
Edwards said he stayed mostly in campgrounds and the occasional hotel, always wearing a mask and trying to maintain social distancing.
“My average social distance is probably higher than it would be at home,” he said.
Edwards, 57, carried all of his equipment on his touring bike — not relying on any support vehicles. He suffered two flat tires early in the trip, but the bike has otherwise held up.
He said the biggest challenges have mostly been physical and mental, especially riding alone for extended periods of time.
On the Twitter live stream, Edwards said he was grateful for all he had learned about the country as he biked across it.
“One great thing about cycling is it allows you to go slowly enough that you can intersect with people and talk to them and learn about them, learn what motivates them,” he said. “It’s been great to have that opportunity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard alumni elected five new members to the Board of Overseers — the University’s second-highest governing body — including four Black alumni and three candidates supported by the young alumni representation campaign Harvard Forward.
The five incoming Overseers include President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta Raphael William Bostic ’87, Princeton University Professor and 22nd Poet Laureate of the United States Tracy K. Smith ’94, professional soccer player Margaret “Midge” Purce ’17, Environment Protection Agency Program Analyst Jayson U. Toweh, and Civil Rights Corps Policy Counsel Dorothy “Thea” L. Sebastian ’08. Purce, Toweh, and Sebastian were supported by Harvard Forward.
The Board of Overseers is responsible for advising University administrators and approving certain actions taken by Harvard’s highest governing body, the Harvard Corporation. Elected directors of the Harvard Alumni Association serve as representatives for Harvard alumni across the University's schools.
Harvard Forward launched last year in a bid to increase recent alumni representation and support for fossil fuel divestment among the Overseers. In the months since, the group has hosted events around the world and maintained an active social media presence, energizing an election process that often passes without incident.
Board of Overseers President R. Martin Chávez ’85 wrote in a press release that the new Overseers will join the board as Harvard faces challenges with little precedent in the University’s centuries-long history.
“All of us on the Board welcome this year’s new Overseers,” Chávez said. “These are extraordinary times, posing extraordinary challenges, and the Board will do all we can to help Harvard navigate them as thoughtfully as possible, always with an overriding concern for the best interests of the University and how it can best serve the world.”
Alumni also elected several incoming HAA directors — including Santiago Creuheras, Kelsey Trey Leonard ’10, Michael D. Lewis ’93, Mallika J. Marshall ’92, Benjamin D. Wei ’08, and Joyce Y. Zhang ’09.
