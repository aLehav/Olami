After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What are you doing today?
A p-set, you say? A response paper, you say? Nothing, you say?
What are you thinking? It’s motherlovin’ April Fools’ Day, only the most important holiday after Halloween (dress up and get drunk) and Thanksgiving (eat food and get drunk). If you haven’t already destroyed at least two of your friendships with your trickery, you’re doing something wrong.
Thanks to impressive spring break scheduling on Harvard’s part, we managed to get St. Patty’s day off (wear green and get drunk), but none of the other major holidays around this time: no Marathon Monday (watch running and get drunk) or Passover (talk about affliction and get drunk) or Easter (as a Jew, just get drunk). Heck, we only get one of the two weeks of Restaurant Week off. So we really shouldn’t be surprised that we have class on April Fools’ Day—although we should, of course, be severely disappointed and outraged. But, as with those other, less important holidays, just because you have two midterms and a paper due does not mean you shouldn’t go all out. In fact, after summer applications, House pride, Easter egg hunts, and telling everyone you know about those two midterms and that paper, you should be well practiced at over-competitiveness and one-upmanship. So make sure your prank is the best.
Luckily, that shouldn’t be hard. Look at all the resources Harvard has at its disposal. Now use them to cause some chaos. The UC gives money to organizations for event publicity. Pretend you’re an organization, and use your free posters wisely. They don’t need to make sense—they just need to embarrass at least one of your friends. There will be at least five events tonight featuring Finale. Take all the blueberries off the tarts and replace them with dyed peanuts. But remember: points off if someone has a severe allergic reaction. And don’t even get me started on the fact that you have access to all of your suitemates’ rooms, as well as all of the foods in your dining hall, including (according to my bookmarked dining.harvard.edu) jerk chicken and that old standby, butternut squash, for dinner tonight. Be creative.
If you’re struggling, remember that there is absolutely nothing wrong with cultural appropriation. In certain French-speaking regions, the challenge is to tape a paper fish to someone’s back without getting caught by your freshly tuna-ed target. In Scotland, you’re supposed to send a hapless messenger on a wild goose chase. Newspapers around the world relish publishing fake stories; NPR’s All Things Considered does the same thing, complete with sound effects. At Harvard, we had some snow last year. That’s going to be a hard one to top, but as proud members of this elite institution, we can probably think of something. If all else fails, write an overeager and vaguely combative op-ed and see what happens.
Take a break from talking about how you feel about military drones, how you’re too tired to prank your friends, how our administration might be searching your email account as you speak. Don’t be sanctimonious about the fact that lying is wrong—and, as we’ve learned, so is cheating apparently. Instead, appreciate that we have one chance a year where deception is actually sanctioned. This is our moment to shine.
It’s April Fools’ Day. It’s time. We have only a month and half left before we’ll be done with this semester and ready to begin our sophomore slumps, junior just-don’t-cares, senior slacks, or, for the Class of 2013, futures. We need to start practicing. Just hang out at a pretty interesting university, enjoy the temperamental spring weather, and realize that today is an entire holiday devoted to being a little strange.
Take a look: Google made sure it’s on your G-Cal. That means everyone on this campus definitely knows about it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At 5 p.m. on admissions day 2011, I sat by myself on my bed, told myself that Vanderbilt (which I’d already gotten into) would be a fun four southern years for a northern girl, closed my eyes, and opened my rejection emails—except they weren’t. The moments that followed are still surreal as I stared at an email from Harvard University that started with “I am delighted to inform you.” I re-read the first lines of that email 10 times and then I closed the email just to check that it wasn’t a mistake, but, magically, when I re-opened the email it still said that I had gotten in.
The afternoon after that was one I’ll never forget. I shouted to my mom over the balcony and she came running into our living room in disbelief. Then she and my younger brother started to do what could only be described as a touchdown dance, while I called my dad who was travelling for work. When I got his voicemail, I left him a composed message and proceeded to call him another five times, more excited each time. My life changed dramatically at that moment. I went from being a high school student who had the world in front of her to a high school senior who had the world through Harvard glasses in front of her. At the time, though, I really had no idea what I would see through those glasses.
The opportunities that Harvard gives its students, or my so-called “Harvard glasses,” are what set Harvard apart from other institutions. It’s why, according to the oh-so-reputable College Confidential, prospective students cry before opening their admissions emails and why tourists take picture of freshmen carrying their laundry from Straus to Weld and are rumored to have on occasion asked students to bless their babies.  The interesting thing, though, is that of the many, many opportunities Harvard offers its students, it’s perhaps the most humble that are the most important.
Yes, Harvard has a gorgeous campus. Yes, George W. Bush’s economic advisor taught my introductory economics class. Yes, Lady Gaga and various countries’ presidents have been on campus in the last year. Yes, many Harvard students check their emails during March and find they have been given several thousand dollars to study abroad for the summer. Those are obviously very amazing aspects of Harvard, but they are not what define Harvard.
Ultimately, despite the benefits of Harvard’s resources and reputation, I learn linear algebra in Applied Math 21b, which is similar to the linear algebra of any other college. Lady Gaga and the president of Argentina don’t sound that much different on YouTube than they sound in person, and I hear that if you take introductory economics at other schools, the teacher actually encourages you to buy an earlier copy of Mankiw’s textbook. So what does Harvard have that causes celebratory touchdown dances?
It’s the students. My peers are stunning. From the moment I moved into a freshman entryway, my peers included a published author, a math whiz who claimed he wasn’t, a girl who had won a national championship for guard (the flag twirlers in the band), and 20 other incredible students. The stories that would casually and unexpectedly be told were mind-blowingly impressive. Yet this phenomenon was certainly not just a feature of my entryway. On the greater Harvard campus I met students who had solved previously unsolved math problems, started a national youth congress, and travelled the world. Suddenly, I was in a place where working to cure cancer by the age of 21 was not unrealistic and 2 a.m. conversations ranged from educated debate about the Catholic Church’s stance on gay marriage and women priests to discussions about U.S. economic policy.
As amazing as all this sounds in writing, it’s too easy to forget that the people make Harvard Harvard. When we increasingly become involved in classes, research, and internships, it becomes too easy to let our peers slip by us. This past weekend, I managed to attend both a show in the Adams Pool Theater and a men’s volleyball game, and I was struck by just how awesome both the cast and team were in their respective roles. Never again will we be in a situation where the incredible people per capita is even half as high as it is now, so why not take advantage of it?
This year, 2,029 students were offered admission to Harvard. To them, Harvard is brand new and shiny. Even though Harvard tends to tarnish a bit as we spend four years here, we must remember that our peers never stop sparkling. Take advantage of their talents and conversations because after these fleeting four years, we may never have the opportunity to do so again.
To the Class of 2017, welcome to Harvard. Enjoy your admitted student status and enjoy Harvard’s shininess. And when you get here in August, enjoy your peers—they are your Harvard glasses.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On April 13, scores of Harvard students will fill Tercentenary Theatre for Yardfest, perhaps the greatest recreational event held at Harvard annually. This year, the event will be headlined by Tyga, a rapper who has recently received some recognition for his new hit, “Rack City.” The same song, however, is a perfect example of why Tyga’s selection to perform at Yardfest is ill-advised at best: The lyrics are deeply misogynistic, and a number of Tyga’s other songs betray even more disturbing sentiment about women. It is an absolute shame that College Events Board has chosen an artist whose songs feature little more than hate speech against women. Regardless of the budget, the College Events Board could have made a better choice.
According to Jeremy M. Tchack ’15, a member of the Harvard Concert Commission, the main goal in choosing Tyga was to select an artist who had released a Top 40 hit, and although Tchack admits that the rapper may not be popular with all students, he believes that the Yard will “go wild” when Tyga raps “Rack City.”
Just look at the lyrics to the rap, however, and you’ll see exactly why that prediction might not come true.  Much of Tyga’s music, including “Rack City” and “Bitch Betta Have My Money,” invoke disturbing pejoratives against women, imply prostitution, and appraise women on the basis of their physical and sexual availability. Certainly, there exists rap that makes use of problematic language with nuance and complexity, but none of this is to be found in Tyga’s songs: His content is unmitigatedly, overridingly misogynistic.
At a university whose students have recently gone to great lengths to combat rape culture, where all students should feel both safe and valued, putting Tyga onstage at a campus-wide event is wholly inappropriate. His message goes against everything that Harvard should be saying to its students about sex and self-worth. As a university, we should work toward a campus culture where women feel empowered and valuable and where all students reject discrimination, be it on the basis of gender, race, or any other component of an individual’s identity. Any woman could feel personally victimized while listening to Tyga’s lyrics, and the College Events Board is wrong to ignore that fact simply because they want to get a Top 40 artist within budget.
Yesterday, a student-initiated petition urging the Office of Student Life to cancel Tyga’s appearance at Yardfest appeared on Change.org, a testament to student disapproval of the College Event Board’s choice. Citing his “explicitly and violently misogynistic lyrics,” the petition garnered over 1,000 signatures within a few hours of release.
Even if value-per-dollar were the only consideration in choosing a Yardfest artist, however, Tyga would still be a poor choice. Between the very strong possibility of student outrage at Tyga’s deeply offensive lyrics and Tyga’s less-than-sky-high popularity, his selection may actually work against the University’s goal of bringing more students out for the event. While budget restraints on Yardfest are understandable, there is really no reason why Harvard couldn’t have chosen a more appropriate artist.
Regardless of how many students Tyga might bring to Yardfest, his selection to perform is deeply troubling. His lyrics represent little more than damaging misogyny, and the College Events Board is sending all the wrong messages by bringing him to Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I was deeply touched by the anonymous op-ed of the student suffering from schizophrenia. Published earlier this semeser, “In Sight, Out of Mind” was not just a rallying cry, but also undeniable evidence that Harvard must do more for its students all along the mental health spectrum. That’s why I was shocked to read the response by Paul J. Barreira, the director of Harvard University Health Services (who is a Board-certified psychiatrist specializing in depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorders). Instead of addressing the issues posed, he insisted simply that Harvard is “doing better.” This shows not only complacency toward Harvard’s mental health crisis, but also insulting dismissal.
I applaud the progress made by the University, especially the efforts to hire more full-time psychiatrists and increasing the number of visits covered by insurance. But none of this, nor pointing out that Harvard has more mental health staff than“most other colleges,” means that HUHS is doing enough.
Barreira cites that many students felt like they received “great care” but notes that “it could be hard to get an initial appointment.” That the latter was mere afterthought demonstrates the disconnect between students and a defensive and complacent administration. For most students, the difficulty of attaining an initial appointment isn’t an inconvenience—it is the very roadblock that leads them not to bother navigating HUHS’s bureaucracy.
According to the 2012 senior survey, 36 percent of graduating seniors “sought help” for mental health. I wonder, though, how many were truly helped. This inquiry is based not only on anecdotal evidence and that of the anonymous author, but also on my own experiences. My sophomore year, I struggled with depression. After finally getting an appointment, the therapist asked a few basic questions (Did I have thoughts of hurting myself or others?), and after a brief talk, nodded sympathetically and asked if I had ever tried an anti-depressant. After a 30-minute visit, I walked out with a prescription for Wellbutrin—which I never took, since I had just written the obituary of a classmate who committed suicide while on that very medication and whose parents sued Harvard for negligence. I didn’t connect with that therapist and was told by peers that, like dating, it can take some tries to find the right one. But I feared that by the time I had found the right doctor, I would run out of allotted appointments—not to mention that each visit would require “getting in the system again.” I gave up and white-knuckled it through the semester.
That a student is placated with anti-depressants after 30 minutes is indicative of HUHS’s pharmaceutical-heavy approach. After all, real care is more expensive—and requires more licensed psychologists than Harvard currently employs.
Junior year, the same darkness descended after a particularly hard break-up. I didn’t understand how what other students could bounce back from could leave me in tears for months. Once again, I went to HUHS. This time, I was prescribed sertraline and strongly urged to take a semester off.  I can still remember my disbelief. Didn’t they understand that I had left my room for the first time in two weeks precisely because I didn’t want to leave Harvard? That I wanted to know how to live my life on campus? How could an institution that had invested so much in my mind, in the form of full financial aid and a wonderland of academic opportunities, not ensure that it was healthy enough to take advantage?
I now wish that I had done more to address my issues then because in the real world, the difficult becomes impossible. In New York, most good therapists charge $300 to $500 per session, none of which is covered by insurance. Insurance provides only for nurse practitioners, qualified to hand out pills. Even if one had the money, most therapists work weekdays from nine to six—when, of course, you do, too.
College is the ideal time to address mental health, which is why HUHS must take it upon itself to ensure that students do not leave campus without a healthy state of mind. Students have flexible schedules and are surrounded by loving friends. My boss at The Crimson, to his credit, was always accommodating when I needed to change my schedule because depression hit. Meanwhile, alumni find themselves isolated, fearful of telling their offices that they are struggling; while the stigma may be dying on college campuses, it is still alive and kicking in the corporate world.
I hope that Harvard realizes how it is preventing its best and brightest from reaching their full potential. Yes, the solution might be expensive: lifting the limit on therapy from 24 sessions to once a week, for however long is needed; hiring enough psychiatrists to meet demand, such that students can schedule appointments with ease and so those professionals know they can do more than hand out prescriptions.
Mental health care is one of the best investments that Harvard can make in its students—and not the least, in its own future. Only healthy alumni have the strong careers that allow them to give back. While HUHS may believe that it is doing better, for many students and recent alumni, better is not close to good enough.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences’ Graduate Student Council is adapting mental health programs implemented at the College to fit its own independent mental health resources.
The GSC kicked off this effort, which includes a drive for improved access to mental health resources and a mental health survey, at a well-attended mental health and wellness resource fair in Dudley House last March.
Mental wellness has been a primary focus for this year’s graduate student government, along with mentoring and diversity, said GSC President Cammi N. Valdez.
The GSC also worked with the Student Health Planning Committee to successfully increase the number of outside mental health visits covered by students’ insurance plans from 12 to 24 annually.
Valdez said that after hearing that undergraduates are asked to fill out surveys before freshman year and twice more before graduating, the council asked why GSAS students did not have a similar survey.
Looking to the success of the undergraduate survey, the GSC plans to introduce its own mental health survey for GSAS students this fall.
“I think that the survey’s going to be a really good thing to highlight graduate mental health as a priority. We’re hoping that HUHS will use it as they do with the undergraduates—to make changes,” she said.
Despite similarities in recent initiatives, however, both Valdez and Undergraduate Council President Tara Raghuveer ’14 stated that there has not yet been any official collaboration between graduate and undergraduate students regarding mental health, primarily due to their different needs.
“Undergraduate needs [seem] very centralized on their residential halls and issues surrounding medical leave whereas graduate needs are very centralized around their advisors,” Valdez explained.
According to Valdez, the much higher number of married graduate students is also a key difference.
Still, members of the GSC look to undergraduates as an example, Valdez said.
“The graduate students expressed disappointment that we hadn’t reached out to them at the town hall meeting. I just hadn’t had the foresight to meet them,” said Raghuveer. “The questions that the UC is focusing on...are very particular to the College.”
Looking forward, Valdez identified a lack of student awareness about potential resources as the largest challenge.
“Students tend to respond better to other students about this issue,” said Valdez, stressing the need for student organizations to take action. “We need to come together as a graduate student community and reach out to our peers. The undergraduates do a phenomenal job with that.”

Undergraduate Council representatives discussed plans for a UC-sanctioned memorandum on student email privacy at Harvard during the UC general meeting Sunday night.
The memorandum, which UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14 said she hopes will be finished by the end of this week, would seek to clarify the University’s policies on the privacy of student college email accounts.
It would also list the authors’ recommendations to the University based on the administration’s policies.
Although the memo will only be concerned with the privacy policy governing student email accounts, it comes in the wake of the early March discovery that Harvard administrators had accessed the email accounts of resident deans in search of a media leak regarding the Government 1310 cheating scandal.
During the meeting, one UC representative raised questions about how allegations that the University searched student organization listservs—which led at least two organizations, including the UC, to cancel River Run festivities—would be addressed in the memo. Interim Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich denied that the OSL had monitored listservs the following day.
“Will [this memo] be written from the perspective that [the Office of Student Life] is not lying through their teeth?” asked Adams House representative Antone Martinho ’13.
He later stated that it was “clear” that the Office of Student Life had been searching the email lists.
In response, Raghuveer said that it was still unclear whether administrators had accessed student organization lists. Still, she assured representatives that there would be an investigation into list privacy.
“This is not going to be a propaganda piece for the OSL,” Raghuveer said of the memo.
Elm Yard representative Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16, a co-author of the memo, said students should know exactly who has access to student emails, when they have access, and the specific grounds for email searches.
“We really want to make sure that student rights are clearly defined,” Kanuparthy told The Crimson following the meeting.
The Council also voted in support of extending MBTA hours on Friday and Saturday nights until 2 a.m.
Jackson F. Cashion ’13, a former Adams HoCo Co-Chair who is not on the UC, presented the resolution to the Council, arguing that it was a chance for Boston-area college students to make a serious change to the subway system.
“If we can mobilize somehow the student governments of the quarter-million college students in the Greater Boston Area, this can be our first try at really having an influence on city policies in Boston and across the state,” said Cashion, pointing to similar resolutions already passed at Boston and Northeastern Universities.

Hundreds of Harvard students flung bags of colored powder at each other Saturday afternoon in celebration of Holi, the Hindu festival of colors.
The occasion—led and organized by Dharma, Harvard’s Hindu Student Association—celebrates the arrival of spring and encourages people of all backgrounds to get involved in their communities and enjoy themselves, according to Dharma co-president Aditi Hota ’14.
The celebration began in the Winthrop House Junior Common Room with food and games of Kabbadi, a traditional South Asian sport.
Students then gathered in the Malkin Athletic Center Quad and formed a large circle around plastic bags of rang, a colored chalk powder, spread across the grass.
One representative from Dharma counted down from ten, after which participants broke from the circle and raced to pick up a bag. Students then tossed rang at each other and into the air in a blast of vibrant Indian pink, purple, yellow, cobalt, and red pigments.
Holi is inspired by an old Hindu myth about the triumph of good over evil in which Prahlada, a devotee of the god Vishnu, overcomes a powerful demon king. The change of season from winter to spring symbolizes his victory.
After the celebration, students expressed excitement at being able to participate.
“I thought it was a good time...It was on my senior spring bucket list,” said Danielle F. Dejoy ’13.
Marjorie Lacombe ’13 said Holi matched her positive expectations.
“I thought it was going to be a large pillow fight with colors. I think that was exactly what it was... a great time for people to take photos, smile, and have fun,” Lacombe joked. “I wish this were a weekly thing.”
Rishab Mehan ’14 expressed relief at the weather conditions.
“It couldn’t have gone better. The sun is shining, everyone’s covered in color; the festival is meant to welcome the beginning of spring and today feels like a full spring day,” said Mehan, who helped organize the event.
Following the celebration, rainbow-colored veterans of the event returned to their daily business through Harvard Square to the fascination of many tourists.
“I can’t wait until next year, and the year after that,” said Steven P. Barroqueiro ’16.

Harvard placed first in the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, which is often considered the most prestigious annual college-level math competition in the world, the Mathematical Association of America announced last week.
Beating other powerhouse institutions such as MIT, UCLA, and Carnegie Mellon, a three-person team—consisting of Allen Yuan ’15, Eric K. Larson ’13, and Evan M. O’Dorney ’15—led Harvard to clinch the Putnam for the second year in a row and the 30th time in the history of the competition.
The first place prize consisted of $25,000 for the Harvard team, along with an additional $1,000 each for Yuan, Larson, and O’Dorney.
Contestants participated in a six-hour written examination containing twelve questions. The students with the top five individual scores on the exam were named Putnam Fellows.This year, Harvard boasts two of the five fellows: Eric K. Larson ’13 and Evan M. O’Dorney ’15.
This is the first time that Larson, who has competed since his sophomore year, was named a Putnam Fellow.
“It’s just sort of a fun competition,” Larson said. “Some people take it more seriously than I do. For me it’s just a fun chance to solve some math problems.”
For O’Dorney, who scored in the top 24 when he first took the exam as a high school senior, this result marks his second consecutive year being named a fellow.
“I’m finding that I’m getting too old for contest math,” said O’Dorney with a smile as he recalled that this was his third year taking the Putnam exam.
Although O’Dorney and Larson are both Mathematics concentrators, they said that one does not need to be familiar with advanced math topics to do well on the Putnam exam.
“The material tested is very basic, but the problems are very tricky,” said Larson. “The questions usually don’t require much in the way of advanced mathematics to solve. They just require cleverly applying basic calculus, linear algebra, group theory, that kind of stuff.”
Teammate Yuan, also a Mathematics concentrator, echoed this sentiment.
“Most of it is stuff that you learn in high school,” said Yuan, who qualified for the Harvard Putnam team for the first time this year.
Unlike Yuan, who will be eligible to take the exam for the rest of his college career, O’Dorney’s next year will mark his last try at the Putnam, which prevents participants from taking the exam more than four times.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An online petition urging administrators to cancel Tyga’s performance at Yardfest garnered more than one thousand signatures on Change.org late Sunday night, circulating via Facebook and email.
The petition, which describes Tyga’s song lyrics as “explicitly and violently misogynistic,” comes days after the College Events Board announced that the rapper would headline this year’s spring music festival and is addressed to the Office of Student Life, the administrative body that oversees the CEB.
Leah Reis-Dennis ’13, who launched the petition, said she decided to protest Tyga’s selection after discussing the issue with friends.
“We were outraged that someone who promotes sexism and violence against women so explicitly would be selected to perform at our college, and we thought that was wrong so we decided to start a petition,” she said. “Tyga has a right to sing and to write whatever he wants, but that doesn’t mean Harvard should give him a platform at our biggest concert of the year to promote that kind of sexism and violence.”
More than 400 people signed the petition in its first hour online. By press time early Monday morning, it had received more than 1,100 signatures, including those of signers identifying themselves as students and alumni. Many signers identified their location as Cambridge, but others hailed from locations across the country.
“I agree with this petition because I don’t think that Harvard as an institution or as an undergraduate body should support an artist that routinely has lyrics that are misogynistic,” said Danielle M. Goatley ’14, who signed the petition. “I know [the CEB] has funding constraints, but you do have to weigh your moral choice when you’re picking an artist.”
Blake A. Wilkey ’13, who said that many of his friends were rappers, also signed the petition, though citing different reasons.
“It’s offensive to me whenever I feel like the cheapest and most commercialized version of that [rap] culture which is pretty rich and full of actual content is chosen as its representative in the public sphere, especially in a place like this,” Wilkey said.
Reis-Dennis said she believes the petition has gained enough attention that OSL will have no choice but to acknowledge student opinion.
“I think [the Office of Student Life] will have to listen because we received over 400 signatures in an hour, which is an undeniable student voice,” Reis-Dennis said. “I would be shocked and outraged if the OSL were to ignore such a strong student voice for change.”

The Committee on Academic Integrity will propose a five-point honor code, including the creation of a “newly designed” Student/Faculty Judicial Board that, for the first time, would give students a voice in adjudicating academic dishonesty cases, according to a report obtained by The Crimson late Sunday.
Populated by both students and faculty members, the new Board would handle exclusively academic cases and remain distinct from the current Administrative Board, which would continue to hear all non-academic integrity cases and some academic dishonesty cases. Students accused of academic cheating would be allowed to choose which board they wanted to hear their case.
The March 26 report, which will likely be delivered to the faculty by Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris at the regular faculty meeting Tuesday, signals the first major step toward overhauling Harvard’s academic integrity policies.
The report, nearly three years in the making, comes near the end of a school year marred by Harvard’s largest cheating scandal in recent memory.
As outlined in the four-page report, the new honor code, Harvard’s first in its 376-year history, calls for a wide-ranging set of protocols intended “to refocus the community on promoting academic integrity.” In addition to the new judicial body, it specifically prescribes a “statement of values” to govern the intellectual community, a “declaration of integrity” to be written on assignments and exams, minor protocol changes for exams, and the publication of more easily accessible disciplinary sanctions online.
“The statement and the subsequent components of the honor code aim to emphasize that the most effective learning is predicated on trust between students and teachers and often depends on collaboration among them,” the report reads. “The honor code and the culture that surrounds it should signal to students that Harvard values learning, intellectual inquiry, and intellectual exploration more than it values the external trappings of ‘success.’”
Chaired by Harris, the Committee on Academic Integrity is composed of students, faculty, and administrators. Harvard officials commissioned the group in fall 2010 to investigate Harvard’s policies and protocols pertaining to academic honesty. The committee’s work came under the microscope after Harvard’s announcement last August that it was investigating roughly 125 students suspected of cheating on a Government 1310 take-home exam. Administrators announced this past February that more than half of the accused students had been required to temporarily withdraw from the College.
Though faculty will not vote on the proposals Tuesday, the report will likely begin a community-wide discussion. When or how students outside the Committee on Academic Integrity will play into that discussion is uncertain, but the report indicates that students already on the committee will play a role in finalizing the details of the proposals, including the new Student/Faculty Judicial Board, already put forth.
Technically, Harvard already has a Student Faculty Judicial Board that is partially composed of students and designed to hear cases that fall outside the domain of the faculty, but it has heard just one case since its inception in 1987.
A 2009-2010 review of the Ad Board raised the possibility of creating a distinct judicial board that, like the newly proposed Student/Faculty Judicial Board, would allow students being investigated to choose whether to have their case considered by the Ad Board or by a hybrid student board.
That report’s recommendation did not gain traction at the time, and as recently as November, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds said Harvard was not yet ready for such a body.
“When that suggestion was first made, I said, ‘We really have to understand how that would work and how it works in practice at other institutions,’” Hammonds said in November. “I still don’t have a complete picture of that, nor what benefits it would bring to us. I think it just needs a lot more research and study.”
Harvard administrators could not be reached for comment late Sunday.
Harvard is currently one of only two Ivy League institutions that does not allow students at least the option of having their case heard by disciplinary board including student members.
In addition to an honor code, the report also calls for more general “cultural interventions,” which would articulate and reinforce ethical standards at various points throughout a student’s undergraduate career, including in a writing placement test before incoming freshmen ever arrive on campus. The report cites a review of University materials on integrity and suggests possible discussion points during Opening Days and Sophomore Orientation, among other points in time.
The final set of proposals included in the report prescribes the creation of an “assignment taxonomy” for faculty members who want examples of model assignments and grading rubrics. It also offers general suggestions on how individual departments might better incorporate integrity discussions into their fields.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 3, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the Committee on Academic Integrity’s honor code proposal would make the Student/Faculty Judicial Board the sole voice in academic dishonesty cases. In fact, the proposed honor code would allow students to choose whether to have their cases heard by the proposed student-populated board or by the existing Administrative Board, which is made up of faculty and administrators.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As they meet before their Wednesday night practice, competitors for the Harvard Quiz Bowl team chat comfortably, rarely mentioning the cheating scandal that has recently rocked their program.
The half dozen players compete for a team, but they are no typical sportsmen—they gather in a classroom, not a locker room, and in a typical practice they do more toss-ups than pull-ups. In a competition short on glory, there are few fans and no monetary prizes.
But this squad of low-profile knowledge-junkies found itself in the headlines this past month when the team was stripped of four national championship titles due to the alleged indiscretions of the team’s former president.
Andrew M. Watkins ’11, who led the club from 2008 to 2011, was accused of viewing game questions in advance of multiple national tournaments, and, though he says he did not use them to cheat, he acknowledges accessing them through an online server.
But players say they have not let the media buzz rattle them. Stephen Liu ’14, the team’s current vice president, is keen to point out that the team has more important things to focus on—wtth this year’s national tournament less than two weeks away, Harvard’s squad will have something to prove in the wake of a scandal that has prompted soul searching throughout the Quiz Bowl circuit.
“I feel like we could win back some redemption,” Stephen Liu says, looking to his teammates for a nod of approval.
MAKING HEADLINES
As the team quietly fills up a small classroom beneath Memorial Hall, Harvard’s players seem a bit bemused by the way the story, propelled by Harvard’s unexpected win in the NCAA tournament on March 21, rocketed into headlines in newspapers based everywhere from Australia to Africa.
“I’m just really amazed that there are random articles from Nepal and Nigeria,” says Liu, as his teammates laugh quietly, shaking their heads in apparent disbelief.
On March 20, National Academic Quiz Tournaments, LLC, announced that an audit of its server logs showed that Watkins, a former question-writer for high school tournaments, had violated the company’s honor code by exploiting a security flaw that enabled him to view college-level questions on the company’s server.
Although none of Watkins’s former teammates have been accused of wrongdoing, NAQT revoked Harvard’s four national championships titles between 2009 and 2011 as punishment.
And while only one member of Harvard’s current team played with Watkins, Harvard’s current players were also pulled into the fray when The Boston Globe, Slate, and The Atlantic Wire contacted team members for interviews in the days after NAQT’s announcement.
Fola A. Sofela ’16, a freshman team member, says the recent media attention has been a motivator.
“The only thing that its going to make anyone do is work harder this year at nationals,” she adds.
REBUILDING, RECLAIMING
For a team preparing to compete in a national championship, Harvard’s players seem remarkably laid back.
“We’re pretty mellow,” shrugs Stephen Liu, as the team’s starting lineup filters in 30 to 45 minutes late.
But the pace picks up when team member Stephen J. Morrison ’15 starts reading questions with the speed and precision of an auctioneer. Suddenly, the players eagerly lean forward, hands hovering over the table as they prepare to “slap in”—an imitation of the electronic buzzers used in official tournaments.
Stephen Liu, a physics concentrator, handily takes the first few toss-up questions on topics ranging from Norse mythology to modern agronomy.
But David J. Liu ’15, a member of Harvard’s “A” team, suddenly “powers,”—or buzzes in early for bonus points—a question about a symphony. His buzz comes too early for anyone else in the room to figure out the composer, much less the movement, as the team rounds out its first packet of questions.
Players in the Quiz Bowl community say they think Harvard’s team dates back to the 1980s, but no one interviewed for this article was entirely sure. They won their first national championship in a tournament organized by the Academic Competition Federation in 1995, and picked up occasional titles in the early 2000s.
But in 2008—the year that Watkins joined the squad—the team embarked on run of back to back championships that would last until 2011.
By several measures, Watkins’s tenure on the team coincided with the program’s rise. Joined by two other celebrated Harvard players—Dallas R. Simons ’12 and Theodore J. Gioia ’12—Watkins played on Harvard teams that took home four national championship titles in three years.
In 2011, he helped Harvard become the first undergraduate team to win the NAQT’s Division I national championship, a title that had previously been taken exclusively by teams with more experienced graduate student players. All of these titles were revoked this past month.
But Watkins, who is now a graduate student at New York University, is long gone from the team.
The team is now coping with new challenges—specifically, the loss of Simons and Gioia, whose graduation last year left the team with holes to fill.
This year, a less experienced team led by Stephen Liu and team president Graham W. Moyer ’15 hopes to revive Harvard’s status as a rising Quiz Bowl powerhouse—without the taint of scandal this time.
“We’re definitely rebuilding, but it has nothing to do with Andy Watkins,” Stephen Liu says.
INTEGRITY IN JEOPARDY?
Rarely, a question will stump the whole team. When no one manages to answer a toss-up about American jurisprudence on eminent domain, Morrison tries to prompt his teammates.
“Come on, guys,” he says, hopefully.
Although every player’s laptop is open, none of them consult Google for the answer—to do so would be poor form.
Reluctantly, Morrison surrenders the answer. “It’s Kelo v. the city of New London.”
Despite the restraint shown by the players at practice, Quiz Bowl is a game particularly susceptible to cheating, players say.
And when competitors cheat in this sport, many say, they have an unquestionable advantage.
“You’re pretty much invalidating the entire point of the game by accessing these questions,” Liu says.
“It’s not like Barry Bonds juicing up, because [in baseball] you still have to be a good hitter,” he adds.
Accessing questions before games in a Quiz Bowl tournament, Morrison chimes in, is “like Barry Bonds playing T-ball.”
The whole team laughs, a little grimly.
Harvard’s Quiz Bowl team is not the only squad dealing with the aftermath of a cheating scandal. The same audit that stripped Harvard of its titles also implicated Scot Putzig from the University of Michigan and another player accused of cheating before a high school tournament in 2010, according to NAQT’s March 20 announcement. And in February, NAQT vacated MIT’s 2012 championship win for the alleged transgressions of Joshua Alman, who was accused of exploiting the same security flaw used by Watkins.
The recent public scrutiny has led many in the Quiz Bowl world—a tightly knit community of elite players and organizers who communicate primarily through online forums—to question the values of the game.
“There’s a problem with cheating,” says Andrew Hart, a law student who played on the University of Minnesota team that Harvard defeated in the 2011 championship. “It’s not just database vulnerabilities; there are ways to do it, if you want to.”
In light of these scandals, David Liu, the team’s music specialist, sounds a note of optimism about the future of the Quiz Bowl community.
”I think people will still trust each other, but I think they’ll be more careful,” he says.
Yet in an environment marred by scandal, Hart says, promoting honest competition is more important than ever.
“People take the integrity of the game seriously,” Hart says. “In a sense, it’s all the game has.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Office of Student Life has requested that the student groups organizing Yardfest reconsider their choice of Tyga as the headliner for the spring concert, following student outcry and an online petition claiming that the rapper’s lyrics promote sexism and violence.
Jeff Neal, a spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, wrote in an email to The Crimson Monday night that administrators will not force the student organizations to withdraw their invitation to the artist.
“The College’s Office of Student Life has asked the College Events Board and Concert Commission to re-evaluate the invitation to Tyga in light of the concerns raised by students that the performer’s lyrics are offensive and hurtful to many in our community,” Neal wrote. “Although the College Administration shares those concerns, overruling a decision made by student leaders would not be in keeping either with our commitment as a College to free expression, however offensive, or to student governance.”
If CEB and HCC leaders choose not to rescind their invitation to Tyga, administrators will ask campus organizations—the Women’s Center, the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, the Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response—to promote dialog among students about the messages in Tyga’s lyrics.
Late Monday night, an email message signed by the HCC and the CEB circulated over House and student organization lists, asking students to fill out a feedback survey. The online questionnaire asks students to write paragraph expressing their thoughts on the selection of Tyga and to indicate whether they believe the CEB and the HCC should reconsider the choice.
CEB and HCC leaders declined or could not immediately be reached for comment late Monday night.
Last Wednesday, CEB and HCC organizers officially announced that they had chosen Tyga to perform at the April 13 concert in Harvard Yard. In response to the pick, a student launched an online petition on Change.org late Sunday night urging administrators to cancel the performance. As of late Monday night, the petition had gained more than 1,700 signatures.
Leah Reis-Dennis ‘13, the student who created the petition, said she has already submitted the signatures the petition has garnered so far to the OSL, and will continue to submit signatures as they come in.
“I commend the OSL for asking the College Events Board to reconsider,” Reis-Dennis said. “I hope that the CEB will take this seriously and will listen to the people who are asking for change.”
In an email to The Crimson late Monday night, Interim Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich acknowledged that the reaction to this year’s Tyga pick has been “stronger” than in years past.
“It is worthwhile to have robust dialog about who should perform at the event,” Friedrich wrote. “The reaction this year raises the important question of how in future years the student organizers can best capture broad student input in advance of the final decision.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last-second heroics by Boston University junior Sydney Godett carried the Terriers past the Harvard women’s lacrosse team, 12-11, on Friday night at Nickerson Field. BU won the contest despite never holding a lead until the very end of the game.
With 11 seconds left, Godett scored on a free position shot off a foul by Crimson (2-5, 0-2 Ivy) defenseman Amelia Capone. The goal was Godett’s second of the game for the Terriers (3-5, 0-1 America East).
Despite jumping out to a quick 6-0 lead within the first five minutes of play, Harvard could not hold off a BU attack that saw five different players score multiple goals. The Terriers were led by senior attack Danielle Etrasco, who had a game-high five points with four goals and one assist.
While the Crimson again used a balanced attack that saw six players score, the defensive unit proved porous against the BU offense even though Harvard edged the Terriers in total shots, 25 to 23, and draw controls, 17 to 8.
A trio of midfielders, junior Kyleigh Keating, senior Danielle Tetreault and captain Micaela Cyr, netted five of the six goals in the Crimson’s early scoring spree.
“We wanted to come out strong,” Cyr said. “We just ran the goal well. We were finishing out shots and it worked well.”
Tetreault led the team in scoring, getting her second hat-trick this season. Keating led the game with six draw controls.
Cyr provided three points, with two goals and one assist, while freshman attack Audrey Todd achieved the same feat. Todd, a rookie who has appeared in all seven contests thus far, has found the back of the net in six games.
“I think people are getting a lot better in terms of moving the ball well,” Cyr said. “That’s translated into multiple people having opportunities to score.”
BU junior attack Elizabeth Morse was the first to put her team on the scoreboard, with a successful free position shot for a goal just over 15 minutes into the first half.
“I think that we came out strong in the beginning of first half,” Tetreault said. “We were controlling tempo of the game and playing the way we wanted to play. I think that we just started letting BU get hope behind them and [let them] take control of the game.”
The Terriers proved effective at capitalizing on Harvard’s fouls, converting four of 10 free-position attempts into goals. A flurry of BU players were able to overwhelm the Crimson defensive unit as senior goalkeeper Melanie Cook wrestled to make eight saves. Cook played the entire game in net for Harvard.
After Tetreault provided the Crimson’s sole free position goal of the contest to bring the score to 7-1, the Terriers went on a 4-1 run over the final six minutes of the opening frame to head into the halftime break down by three, 8-5.
During the run Etrasco scored her first two goals of the game, both unassisted, while senior midfielder Kristen Mogavero also provided a pair of goals. Mogavero’s first came from a handoff by Godett while BU had a man advantage from a yellow card on junior defenseman Lauren Tomkinson. Mogavero’s second was yet another free position goal.
Todd closed out the period with her first goal of the game to break BU’s run, after a foul by Terrier freshman Ally Adams.
While the Crimson was quick to return to the scoreboard, as Cyr drilled her 18th goal of the season just 26 seconds into the second frame, a 3-0 run by BU brought the Terriers within one, 9-8. Todd pulled the Crimson to a two-goal lead with her second unassisted goal, but two more BU scores tied the contest.
Senior midfield Nina Kucharczyk provided the final goal of the game for the Crimson with 7:10 remaining, as her team failed to beat Terrier goalkeeper Christina Sheridan for the rest of the contest.
“Their goalie made some great saves,” Cyr said. “We had a couple of turnovers and that gave them more opportunities on their offensive end.”
BU sophomore attack Kelsey Marafioti grabbed an assist from Etrasco to knot the game again. From there, the stage was set for Godett’s game-winner.
The loss comes after Harvard found its first two wins of the season over spring break.
“I think we had chances the same as they did and the shots weren’t falling our way but we were right there with them,” Tetreault said.

Are you worried that courtship is dead at Harvard? Have you been friend-zoned?  Do you spend all of your time waiting to be called out on "I Saw You Harvard?" Has this ever happened to you?
In an effort to help Harvard students learn how to date, Laure E. "Voop" de Vulpillieres '02 is offering an inclusive, college-wide "Dating Skills Workshop" on April 5 at 7 p.m. in Cabot's Senior Common Room.  The workshop seeks to teach students such fundamental skills as meeting potential dating partners, asking someone out, and engaging in polite conversation.
In order to teach "the art of seduction in any social scenario," a publicity email sent out over House lists reads, participants will practice "flirting with furniture" and "making eyes at strangers."  If you're interested in practicing your pickup lines on a floral print loveseat, you should RSVP for this limited-enrollment event here.
One would hope these basic skills would be common sense. Then again, we all can think of fellow students who could stand to learn how to engage in conversation, pick up on social cues, or better understand the delicate line between creepy and cute.
In fact, on second thought, the University may actually want to consider adding this course to freshman orientation.
