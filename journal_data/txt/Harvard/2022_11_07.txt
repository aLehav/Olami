After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Producer Miles M. Bonsignore wants you to break up with your boyfriend.
While he envisions himself, a couple of years down the line, looking out across a vast floor of telemarketers in a full call center dedicated to curating advice requests for him to answer on air in his hit podcast “The Perfect Person Podcast”, for now, Bonsignore will settle for his one-man operation — answering calls on set with his freelance sidekick Will Witwer and giving advice to his podcast listeners.
As the podcast producer for the Try Guys, Bonsignore has worked on podcasts professionally for years. He’s even hosted a couple of episodes of his own “very bad podcasts that just were not good” in the past. As a result, he’s collected quite a bit of experience to apply to his newest endeavor: “The Perfect Person Podcast,” a comedy advice show where Bonsignore answers audience call-in advice requests with the goal of helping his listeners “achieve maximum perfection.”
“It was kind of easier than I thought it would be to start,” said Bonsignore in an interview with The Harvard Crimson. “I was doing the Mr. Miyagi ‘I was doing the training all along to start my own podcast’ thing.”
Comedy advice podcasting is a unique genre, but Bonsignore believes the work he does helps people beyond pure entertainment.
“Oftentimes, girls call asking whether to break up with their boyfriends. And the answer is always to definitely break up,” Bonsignore said. “People are just calling for permission, usually. People know the answer to the advice question that they're asking for.”
Bonsignore grinned, “And you can quote me on that, because it's just a flawless sentence: ‘People know the answer to the advice question you’re asking for.’” He paused. “That's good for The Crimson. That's gonna be front page news.”
Bonsignore’s comedic tone is unapologetically hyper-confident but also appears genuinely passionate. In nearly the same breath, he gives advice to take bubble baths and sensitively unpacks grief and loss.
Bonsignore cites Ben Schwartz, Jake and Amir of “CollegeHumor,” Drew and Enya of the “Emergency Intercom” podcast, and Ziwe as some contemporary comedians he admires. “I think that the way that I talk is fully ripped off of maybe 15 comedians that I really, really loved growing up, and then was trying to love their humor while writing my own stuff and adding my take,” he said. But in “Perfect Person,” Bonsignore pairs this conglomerated humor with real vulnerability, creating a project worth more than mere advice delivery.
“I went through a lot of crazy stuff in my life. And I want to share that in an effort to make people feel seen, not in an effort to gain sympathy,” Bonsignore sighed. “Sharing can be weird because it's obviously performative to share anything on the Internet. But by sharing things, hopefully, if you're being real about it, you are connecting with people.”
Bonsignore knows quite a bit about being real. In his end-of-show segment called “Get Real,” he plays somber classical music and bombards his guests with a series of highly personal questions such as “When was the last time you cried?” Although answers from guests can begin as fairly stilted and inauthentic, the segment invariably morphs into a genuinely hilarious dive into refreshing vulnerability.
“Comedy that's vulnerable generally has stakes to it. People call my show about grief, for example, something that I've experienced a lot. And I feel like that makes me feel closer to them,” Bonsignore said. “If everyone's being vulnerable, you're able to have an inside joke with a huge amount of people. Sometimes they're worse and sometimes they’re better, but generally, we all have similar problems.”
Bonsignore’s current career is a product of a uniquely internet-driven job trajectory. In college, he majored in dramatic art and media production and minored in screenwriting. He always wanted to be a performer, but was hesitant to pursue the typical rejection-lined path of auditions.
“I just thought that if I learned enough stuff, then they can't say no to me,” said Bonsignore.
He spent some time behind the camera at BuzzFeed before being hired by the Try Guys as they started their own production company. He first decided to pitch a podcast to the Try Guys after returning from his hernia surgery leave.
“I was worried that I was falling behind so I just kind of presented all these spreadsheets that I don't even know what they meant and I said, ‘What if we do a podcast?’” said Bonsignore, throwing his hands up with a shrug. “And the guys said to go for it.”
While working on the “TryPod” and several other podcasts for the company, Bonsignore transitioned from only producing content to having a heavier speaking role in the podcast, making a seamless transition from off-camera to on.
“The great magic trick of my career is that I always wanted this,” he said.
Bonsignore’s performance persona has truly blossomed with the release of “Perfect Person” and his renewed focus on independent projects.
“I feel so lucky that I get to do this. And I don't have to make copies for someone who’s mad at me for not ordering lunch correctly anymore,” Bonsignore said. While Bonsignore is still busy — “I’m a busy little boy,” he says — his days are now filled with solo projects, collaborations with other creators, and a day job with the Try Guys.
When asked if he had any advice specifically for Crimson readers out there — “So you’re saying I have a mouthpiece to the Ivy League elite at this point?”— Bonsignore delivered a few key points. “Worry less — a hard thing to pull off but just try. Take a deep breath. And take a bubble bath!”
After finding out that most Harvard dorms do not contain bathtubs, Bonsignore sighed. “You know, you see ‘The Social Network’ and you think they’ve got everything, but then no bathtubs. That’s a problem.”
Lastly, Bonsignore returned to his typical blend of humor and blunt sincerity to deliver a final piece of advice to The Crimson’s readers: “Just be nice to each other, baby!”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On May 5, after two years of committee research, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay laid out a new process for denaming — removing names from — Harvard entities.
Though the process has flaws — why can’t you, as of today, submit a request to rename a building? — it is reasonable. A denaming request ought to address the person’s life with care, including the moral standards of their own time and the extent to which their legacy is tarnished by problematic actions.
Many advocates of denaming have not been so nuanced, however. In The Crimson Editorial Board’s opinion on the topic, we describe several namesakes of Harvard buildings solely by their worst actions, proclaiming sweepingly that “names affiliated with white supremacy and its atrocities should be the first to go.”
I understand where this line of thinking comes from. These offenses, viewed from a modern perspective, are often repugnant, and implicate aspects of our history that still resonate powerfully today. This makes engaging with them deeply personal and emotional.
Issues of systemic oppression are extremely important, and we should do all we can to address and change that legacy. However, denaming might not be the right strategy.
Many of the namesakes of Harvard entities are people from the old Harvard: University presidents, Massachusetts governors, business tycoons, and the like. And these people had flaws. Take Charles W. Eliot — a member of the Class of 1853, Harvard University President and namesake of Eliot House, he was a staunch opponent of labor unions, in favor of racist policies, and skeptical about educating women. But Eliot, the longest-serving president of Harvard, also elevated the status of the College drastically, embraced courses in the sciences, eliminated strict course requirements to create the modern flexible liberal-arts curriculum, and removed wealth-biased barriers to entering the College like knowledge of Greek. And, while he was in favor of racial segregation, Eliot’s presidency saw Harvard’s first Black graduates, honorees, and professors. There was more to his legacy than the actions we look back on today with shame.
Broadly, questions about legacy and memorial should take into account the entire person, assessing actions in both their original moral context and our modern one. There are situations in which denaming is obviously the correct choice — for someone like Robert E. Lee, whose legacy is doing something horrible. But usually the calculus is more complicated.
One of the issues most often cited in reexaminations of our history is chattel slavery, a horrible injustice, but one that was relatively widespread practice in the 17th century. At least deep down, many seemed to know it was immoral: ministers, for example, urged their congregations to treat enslaved servants with kindness and often published anti-slavery writing.
A good test case is the Mathers, father and son. Increase Mather, Class of 1656, was namesake of Mather House, a minister, President of Harvard, and a complicated man. He participated in the Salem Witch Trials yet advocated that they uphold the presumption of innocence. He opposed freedom of religion but made way for scientific advancement, including promoting smallpox inoculation. And he held one slave, given to him late in life by his son, Cotton Mather, Class of 1678, an active participant in the slave trade. We know almost nothing about Increase’s relationship with this slave, only that he freed him in his will.
Does this tarnish Increase’s legacy enough that we shouldn’t honor him? I’d argue not — his personal impact on slavery was limited, by the standard of the time, and his choice to largely avoid the practice and ultimately free his slave seems to show that he had doubts. But the same doesn’t hold for Cotton, who was doing much more than just playing along.
It’s all well and good to debate the nuances of legacy. But why should we continue to celebrate these people, when there are surely less controversial figures to uphold?
Because Harvard rests on the shoulders of those who have built it. And replacing those names with others — even those whose legacies may have been more upstanding — whitewashes our history. Without them, the next generation will not have an accurate picture of how their new home has developed over time.
Choosing to leave names in place does not imply that we condone the namesakes’ bad behavior. Instead, it conveys that despite their flaws, these people did great good for Harvard, and that this good is not overshadowed by an anachronistic re-assessment of their actions. “As we consider removing names, we should examine these lives with humility,” the denaming committee said, “recognizing that our own ideas and behavior may one day be looked upon with dismay by generations to come.”
The crimes of the past should not be ignored; Harvard’s history should be told in all its ugliness. And, upon critical assessment, there may be people — like Cotton Mather — who deserve retrospective sanction. That’s the purpose, after all, of the denaming request form.
All I mean to do, ultimately, is advise caution. We would set a dangerous precedent by striking people from our collective memory when we judge that their actions have fallen too far behind a shifting moral line. And, more broadly, we should not define people by their greatest failures, nor conflate the ills of past societies writ large with the personal character of actors born into and constrained by them.
“We should approach our history through reckoning, not forgetting,” the committee on denaming wrote. I agree.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Writer’s note: this article was written before the Itaewon Halloween crowd crush that occurred on October 29th, 2022. As a result, it does not mention or engage with the tragedy. 
In freshman fall, I heard about a Korea-themed study break happening in my entryway. Confused as to what a “Korea” theme would entail, I decided to go. It turned out to be an evening of applying Korean face masks, playing Korean music, and eating Bonchon chicken.
To be frank, it was super weird.
I wasn’t offended, per se, and I’m not saying that the organizers were to blame. But the experience impacted me because it was the moment I realized that certain token elements of Korean contemporary life had come to represent my country to non-Koreans. Like croissants to France and anime to Japan, I was witnessing — in real time — my country becoming a consumable aesthetic.
When I was in primary school, I was the only Korean kid in my grade. Back then, in the mid-to-late 2000s, I met people who literally did not know where Korea was. (And believe it or not, some of these people were not students, but teachers.)
But as I grew up, hallyu (the Korean wave) hit Asian countries — and Australia, with its close proximity to Asia, experienced the influence fairly quickly. I started finding out that some of my non-Korean friends loved K-pop. Suddenly, they wanted me to teach them Korean and answer their questions about Korean culture. By the time I got to college, the globalization of hallyu had well and truly cemented. I saw that Seoul was now romanticized as a travel destination or place of fantasy akin to Paris or London. It was very strange to see my peers play out fictional scenarios about having a “K-drama” life in Korea — a place that held not wonder, but reality, for me.
As weird as it was to be a real-life Korean person amongst all this idealized garble, I also began to feel an increasingly panicked defensiveness. Because as much as I was getting sick of hallyu, I could sense that white society was getting even sicker of it.
This resentment reared its head with K-pop, which had risen too quickly to allow for proper adjustment. Non-Korean people didn’t seem to know quite what to do with it. In many cases, the reaction of choice was confusion, but sometimes, the response was straight-up racism. In 2019, an Australian network played BTS’ success for racist laughs, just one of many instances of xenophobic speech attempting to mock, emasculate, and demean BTS. Overall, it seemed like K-pop was being shelved as an intensely niche and off-putting interest; something not quite understandable, not quite acceptable, not quite comfortable, for the rest of us.
The conversation shifted, though, when “Parasite” had its historical sweep at the Oscars in 2020. Suddenly, people were lauding the film as one of the best and most revolutionary works of art in recent history. Of course, this kind of over-the-top praise also engendered genuinely ugly pushback. I sensed that a kind of litmus test over “Parasite” was emerging. Whether you had watched it, and whether you had thought it was as incredible as everyone else did, became a silent indication of not just your sense of artistic taste, but where you stood on race. The same happened yet again when “Squid Game” was released on Netflix.
Post-“Parasite”, it felt like “Koreanness” was now something that had risen to, and was owned by, the mainstream. But at the same time, it was a precarious tightrope walk: K-culture could never actually be the mainstream because of fundamental racial lines of power. There was thus something tokenistic and false about the conversation — Korea felt like it had become a proxy in a larger, unspoken dialogue about race.
In other words, it became messy, and it still remains messy today. One side of this triangle continues to shower hyperbolic praise on Korea as a producer of profound, never-before-seen art. The second side flocks to K-pop, Korean dramas, and Korean variety programs, irresponsibly romanticizing Korean culture, life, and people. And the last side is vocally critical of K-culture’s sudden and meteoric rise – sometimes for legitimate reasons, and other times out of sheer racism or jealousy.
As different as these approaches are, all of them erase the very people central to this crazy triangle – Koreans themselves. And as much as cultural sharing is important and can be productive, it’s also undeniable that, for me and others like me, it’s all been a little exhausting.
Because in the span of just fifteen to twenty years, Koreans who live overseas have swung from being ignored, fetishized, erased, commodified, and romanticized — all at the whim of white society’s attitude towards our country. When I reflect on these things, I can’t help but wish I could just watch my K-dramas in peace, the way I did as a kid. When the world’s ignorance about Korea was actually kind of a blessing, in that it provided me with a tranquil cultural vacuum.
Although that vacuum can never exist again, I’m now looking forward to the day when the hype dies down, and Korean arts and culture reach a sense of ambivalent, neutral normalcy instead. I know it may take months, even years, to get to that point — but it’s going to be worth it.
After all, I waited about a decade for the average person to be able to point to my country on a map. What’s a little more waiting?

Medical and legal authorities spoke about the ethics and future of biotechnology at a Friday panel hosted by the Program on Science, Technology, and Society at the Harvard Kennedy School.
As part of the 20th anniversary of the STS, Harvard Medical School Dean George Q. Daley ’82, Harvard Law School professor I. Glenn Cohen, and ​​Harvard Medical School genetics professor George M. Church participated in a panel moderated by Jenny Reardon, who directs the Science and Justice Research Center at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Other panel participants included Christina Woopen, director of the Center for Life and Ethics at the University of Bonn, and Northeastern professor Patricia J. Williams.
During the panel, Church spoke about the inefficacy of discussing ethics in terms of dichotomies like “good versus evil” and “human rights or not having human rights.” He also criticized the binary logic of the trolley problem, an ethical dilemma where one must choose whether or not to sacrifice one person to prevent the deaths of multiple others.
“Do you have the trolley go towards the 100 kittens or human embryos, or do you have it go towards some felon?” he said. “The problem with the trolley problem is that none of these individuals should be on the trolley tracks in the first place.”
Daley said advances in biotechnology have given humanity more power to manipulate natural processes.
“If the evolution of life on Earth is the play, humans are becoming the playwrights,” he said.
Daley also discussed the ways in which medical treatment and human enhancement are becoming increasingly conflated, pointing to gene editing as an example.
“What is genetic variation in a normal sense, and what is pathological?” he asked. “And where do we draw the line between disease treatment and human enhancement?”
Woopen added that humans should refrain from being “emperor” and trying to “control nature” but should instead shift to becoming its “custodian.”
Cohen explained that recent biotechnological advances can have “huge spillover effects” that cannot be contained or regulated, because regulatory policies differ from country to country.
“You cannot contain them merely to your polity, to your countries, and whatever policy you like,” Cohen said of the spillover effects. “[Woopen’s] suggestion was deep international regulation, but the truth of the matter is that kind of regulation is by far the hardest to achieve,” he said.
A self-described “techno-pessimist,” Williams also cautioned the audience about what she perceives as a “crisis of loneliness” resulting from technological advances.
“A crisis of seeing and being that allows us to impose our most solipsistic imaginative constructs upon cartographies in ways that eliminate the who, the what, the where — it is literally before our eyes,” she said.
In closing remarks for the panel, Reardon said she believes society must assess the ethical concerns raised by emerging biotechnologies.
“We need to reconceive of each of these things, and as we reconceive science, technology and education, we’ll be reconceiving what society has to,” she said.

The Association of Black Harvard Women hosted its fourth annual vigil commemorating Black transgender lives lost in the past year on Saturday.
The event — held in Holden Chapel in collaboration with the Queer Students Association, the Harvard Foundation, and the Office of BGLTQ Student Life — featured a series of guest and student speakers, as well as a performance by the Harvard Kuumba Singers. Portraits and biographies of the Black transgender individuals who lost their lives in the past year were placed throughout the chapel.
Tiffany C. Onyeiwu ’25, ABHW’s inclusivity chair and an organizer of Saturday’s event, gave the vigil’s opening remarks, stressing the importance of immediate action to protect transgender people.
“Black transgender folks, and in particular Black transgender women, face an epidemic of physical and verbal violence,” Onyeiwu said. “As Harvard students and community members from around the world, it is our duty to stop the cycle.”
Sadé Abraham, senior director at the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, said in her address that violence against transgender people is deeply institutionalized.
“We live in a world where discrimination, harassment, and violence against Black trans, intersex, queer, and gender non-conforming LGBTQ people permeate virtually every institution and setting,” Abraham said.
The Queer Students Association’s co-presidents Alana L. Young ’24 and Atlas Sanogo ’24 said the advantage that Harvard students have is to disrupt a system of oppression through “having access to an elite educational institution.”
“Granted, [this institution] is one that very often does not support us, inflicts violence upon us, and erases us,” Young added. “Nevertheless, our education here is a ticket into the world that many of our trans siblings will never be able to access.”
In a keynote speech, Chastity Jamaria Bowick — executive director of the Transgender Emergency Fund, a nonprofit supporting low-income and unhoused trans people in Massachusetts — spoke about her goal of building solidarity for Black transgender people.
“I hope our allies will rise among us to fight for our rights — I hope our family members will stand with us,” Bowick said. “I hope the Black community will support and love Black transgender individuals.”
In an interview after the vigil, Onyeiwu spoke to the importance of intersectionality in her work.
“To nip all of the buds of injustice, we also have to nip transphobia and homophobia — racism is connected to that as much as it’s also connected to sexism,” Onyeiwu said. “Yes, this is a trans issue, but all of these injustices impact one another and compound on one another.”
Reverend Irene Monroe, a Harvard Divinity School graduate and queer Black pastor who spoke at the vigil, also emphasized the importance of intersectionality in understanding the discrimination and violence against transgender people.
“The importance of centering trans lives is that we’ve got to understand the intersections of all oppressions here — that trans misogyny is as pernicious as racism, as homophobia, as antisemitism,” Monroe said in an interview following the vigil.
Onyeiwu also encouraged those who do not identify as members of the transgender community to do “work year-round” to support transgender people.
“If you’re not part of the trans community, tie your laces, because you’re running this marathon to be an ally,” Onyeiwu said. “Show up for trans folks in whatever way you can.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Quad Grille, a late-night restaurant operated by students, fully reopened on Halloweekend for the first time this year.
Following a grand opening on Oct. 27, the grille, located in the Junior Common Room of Pforzheimer House, now allows students to grab a late snack past dining hall hours every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m.
Customer Rick Z. Zhou ’25 said the Grille has a “wholesome” environment — students were playing Mario Kart and engaging in conversation, he said, as he sampled the grille’s dinosaur shaped chicken nuggets.
“I would say, unequivocally, my life is at least 200 percent improved,” Zhou said during his first-ever trip to the grille on Friday.
“My Board Plus is running low, and I regret that I was spending it on other places apart from the Quad Grille,” he added.
The Grille is managed by Pfoho residents Jane Y. Rhee ’23 and Melinda F. Meng ’23, who decided to take on a management role after seeing an announcement from the Pforzheimer House Faculty Dean seeking new leadership.
Rhee said she values the hands-on experience that comes with operating the Grille, which cannot be gained in a classroom environment.
”I thought it’d be such a cool opportunity to run a mini business with my best friend and my blockmates,” she said.
Since the grille reopened, Rhee observed that “a lot of people come out” to the Junior Common Room, estimating that 90 students are served by the grille each night.
“I think the grille was something that was missing for a long time,” Rhee said.
The grille attracts customers through social media promotions, offering free food in exchange for student reposts.
“Quad Grille posted on Instagram that if you repost this, then you get free waffle fries only this weekend,” Alex Lee ’25 said. “We saw it on the shuttle here and were like, ‘Oh my god, we have to get free waffle fries.’”
According to Evan J. Reynolds ’25, assistant manager of the Grille, word of mouth has been central to the grille’s initial popularity.
“In the Quad, it’s such a good community here that people are just talking about it,” he said. “I think a lot of people came because they were with friends who knew that the grille was open.”
The Quad Grille also distinguishes itself from the other house grilles through its unique weekly themed menu.
During opening week, which fell on Halloweekend, the menu’s offerings included fried cheesecake with berry blood and a Frankenstein milkshake.
Next week, the grille will offer a Korean-themed menu complete with kimchi cheese quesadillas, dumplings, and mango shaved ice.
Brayden H. Orpello-McCoy ’24 said he appreciates that students can now “get food that is quality” with BoardPlus even after missing dinner.
Lane M. Theander ’24 agreed with Orpello-McCoy, noting that he likes being able to have food “past when the dining hall is open.”
Cronkhite resident and grille customer Ricardo S. Marrero-Alattar ’25 added that, aside from providing easier access to food, the Quad Grille could enhance the late night Quad social scene.
“I think that it’ll provide an avenue for people to be more willing to attend Quad parties, especially given the late hours,” he said.
Marrero-Alattar added that the Quad Grille can also motivate students to make the trip to the Quad “for a late night adventure.”
Correction: November 10, 2022:
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the Quad Grille reopened in October for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic. In fact, the grille opened for the first time this year. It was open several days last academic year.

A group of former mayors and professors discussed the future of cities at a panel hosted by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Program on Science, Technology, and Society on Friday afternoon.
The panel focused on the concept of the “smart city” — a city that uses technology to solve city issues and improve communication between city leaders and their constituents — and the implications of integrating new technologies into city planning.
Moderator Diane E. Davis, an Urban Planning professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, kicked off the panel by warning the audience of the drawbacks to the smart city.
Though innovative ride-sharing and transportation start-ups like Uber fill a gap in the market, Davis said they come “at the cost of neglecting high-need areas and populations from socioeconomically vulnerable groups.”
“We found that the planning and implementation processes that can make possible the adoption of sought-after smart mobility policies may also inadvertently worsen mobility and accessibility gaps,” Davis said.
Former New York City mayor Bill de Blasio said he observed the unintended consequences of using “smart technology” during his time in office.
According to de Blasio, New York City partnered with the private firms Intersection and ZenFi Networks to turn payphones into kiosks through LinkNYC, which would offer local information and free WiFi, but the kiosks have not been used as planned.
“It turned out that a lot of individuals who did not have something better to do were using the kiosk to get service to watch pornographic movies,” de Blasio said.
Attendee Dennis F. Kunichoff, who works at the François Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights, pushed back against de Blasio for framing his story about the WiFi kiosks as a technology failure instead of a failure on the city’s part to deal with the homelessness crisis.
In response, de Blasio said these technologies are often hard to implement in a way that immediately makes progress on “a multi-generational project.”
“The kind of religiosity with which we talk about smart cities and innovation for innovation’s sake is often met on the ground with an entirely different reality,” he said.
Panelist Rafal Dutkiewicz — the former mayor of Wrocław, Poland — noted that his city uses a “knowledge-based economy” requiring “really good cooperation between businesses and academia” and an “open and international society.”
During the panel discussion, Jason B. Jackson, an assistant professor of political economy at MIT, urged academics not to lose sight of the past when considering the future of cities.
“As we think about the kind of possibilities for new urban technologies, it’s useful for us to think back to the past as well to see what we can learn from earlier experiments with creating novel new types of cities,” Jackson said in an interview with The Crimson after the event.
Maarten A. Hajer, a professor of Urban Futures at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, talked about the role urban planning experts can play in making cities more sustainable and less reliant on fossil fuels.
“Academics must stop only analyzing the past, but start to provide these alternative futures, these aspirational futures, that show that the post-fossil city is worth living,” Hajer said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, parents, siblings, and family members flooded Harvard Yard to participate in First-Year Family Weekend, hosted by the Dean of Students Office.
The weekend featured scheduled programming, including the Harvard-Columbia football game, performances from the First-Year Arts Program, and special access to the Annenberg dining hall and various museums on campus.
Ashley L. Redhead ’26 said he found Family Weekend to be a welcome reprieve from the fast pace of the fall semester. Rather than attending the scheduled events, Redhead opted to spend time with his family in a more informal setting.
“It’s our first semester, and it feels like we’ve just been working non-stop,” Redhead said. “I really appreciated this weekend to see my family and reground myself.”
Redhead’s father Ashley L. Redhead Jr. added that the weekend gave parents an opportunity to meet and connect with one another.
“I’ve met so many different parents on and off campus, and so many connections were made just as a result of someone in the elevator seeing my button or someone seeing the hat — from Trader Joe’s to the hotel elevator lobby,” he said.
For Isabella U.M. Texeira-Ramos ’26, Family Weekend was a particularly “important” experience because it allowed her to spend a week with her mom despite being unable to travel home for Thanksgiving.
“I’ve had great opportunities to be able to introduce my mom to all of my friends, to introduce her to a lot of my support system on campus,” she added.
As a performer in the FAP show and the musical Something Rotten, Texeira-Ramos appreciated the chance to stage performances for the visiting families.
“There [were] a lot of people that turned out that we weren't expecting to be there, much more beyond just the parents of who were performing, and I think that was super special,” Texeira-Ramos said.
Catherine Texeira-Ramos, a parent who flew in from Arizona, said she enjoyed seeing her daughter settled on campus.
“The friendships that she’s made here is the family that she’s given herself here,” she said. “It warmed our hearts to know that they have a family here.”
Avinashi A.L. Bhandari ’26 said she took advantage of the weekend to show her mother, an English professor, her interest in the sciences.
“It was very interesting to take her to my math class, and I took her to a research fair, so it was kind of like a day in my life,” she said. “I had a fantastic time.”
Bhandari added that while her mom’s career as a professor means she is already familiar with the lives of college students, Family Weekend served as a “good way for her to get an insight on my life.”
“I think it was pretty nice to have my mom around with me,” she said. “I’ve missed her.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly 2,000 Harvard students have signed onto a petition advocating for hot breakfast service across all upperclassman dining halls.
Harvard’s undergraduate-led Student Labor Action Movement launched the petition last week in collaboration with the University’s dining hall workers' union, UNITE HERE Local 26. The statement urges the University to expand hot breakfast offerings to all upperclassman dining halls to promote student wellbeing and alleviate the workload of dining hall workers.
Harvard University Dining Services currently only serves hot breakfast in Annenberg Hall and Quincy House every weekday, while other upperclassman houses offer continental breakfast.
Petitioners argue the limited hot breakfast service “places an unnecessary burden” on dining hall workers at the limited locations and “deprives many students of a filling meal in the morning.”
In a statement, HUDS spokesperson Crista Martin defended the breakfast offerings.
“Harvard University Dining Services works in close coordination with Harvard College to determine the appropriate level of operations to support the College’s goals regarding House life, community and equity, as well as to manage financial resources efficiently without compromising community goals,” Martin wrote. “We see a similar balance managed by colleagues at peer institutions where dining is a self-sustaining service.”
The Harvard Undergraduate Association expressed support for the petition in its November email to students.
“With these grievances in mind, we are joining with SLAM to demand Harvard offer hot breakfast in every dining hall, with the appropriate staff to do so,” the email read.
In 2009, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences slashed hot breakfast offerings in the 12 upperclassmen houses in a budget cut, saving the University roughly $900,000 per year at the time, but HUDS expanded its hot breakfast service to Quincy House in 2021.
SLAM organized the campaign for hot breakfast expansion in solidarity with the dining hall workers’ union. The organization’s emails publicizing the petition say the demands have garnered the support of the union’s stewards.
UNITE HERE Local 26 also circulated its own petition, which advocates for the expansion of hot breakfast across more undergraduate dining halls in an effort to create “more jobs to help the overwhelmed Halls that currently have Hot Breakfast.”
The union’s petition claims that the current hot breakfast service “ignores important realities” on campus.
“Undergraduates do not have the time or the ability to travel to Quincy or Annenberg in the morning; workers and their workspaces cannot serve the high volume of students who do make the trip,” the petition reads.
Charlene V. Almeida, who has worked for HUDS for 20 years and is currently based in Quincy House, said the current hot breakfast model has placed a “huge strain” on workers.
“I’m starting to feel bad because we’re serving over 600 students for breakfast,” she said. “They'll be waiting outside for the hot breakfast, waiting in long lines because [the dining hall workers] cook everything at once, but the kitchen is small.”
Syd Sanders ’24, an organizer for SLAM, said the petition aims to ensure all students have access to hot breakfast. While Quincy House and Annenberg Hall are open to all students for breakfast, Sanders said students living in the Radcliffe Quadrangle are disadvantaged.
“For students, it’s a wellness thing, and it’s a quality of life thing,” Sanders said.
HUDS spokesperson Crista Martin wrote in an email that the petition “contains several misleading statements.”
Martin wrote that, in 2009, Harvard College reduced the board rate in response to the 2008 financial recession. Subsequently, HUDS was “restructured to gain efficiency in the least utilized meal period of the day.”
“No staff layoffs (job losses) occurred in this change,” she wrote.
In 2021, HUDS expanded its hot breakfast offerings to Quincy House.
“Since the addition of that service, multiple jobs representing an additional 155 labor hours have been added at Quincy House just to support service of the enhanced breakfast menu,” Martin wrote.
Keith E. Hylton ’24, a student in Lowell House who signed the petition, said students should have access to hot breakfast in their own houses.
“It's important for the students to be able to actually get breakfast in their house without having to make long treks before class,” he said.
Hilton added that the continental breakfast options are “limited.”
Sanders said SLAM hopes to garner as many signatures as possible before delivering the petition to administrators.
“We're not going to back down from this,” Sanders said. “This is obviously something that is needed on this campus and it's a shame that we don't have.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s soccer closed out a remarkable regular season with a decisive 5-0 victory over Columbia on Jordan Field last Saturday evening, while celebrating its seven seniors—Hannah Gardner, Hannah Griffin, Lara Schenk, captain Jordan Di Verniero, captain Ava Lung, Sophie Hirst, and Angela Caloia—in front of over 600 spectators in attendance.
Griffin opened the scoring frenzy against Columbia (7-5-3, 3-3-1 Ivy League) in the eighth minute with a pass from Hasbo before assisting Caloia in the twenty-eighth minute for a 2-0 lead. Hasbo then struck twice in the first fifteen minutes of the second half to put the Crimson up 4-0, with the ball rarely crossing back into Harvard’s defensive territory at times as Harvard maintained possession for a majority of the match.
When the ball did cross into Harvard territory, the defense shone, with sophomore Jade Rose and Schenk pressuring any attacks by Columbia forwards. Gardner’s two saves brought her shutout count this season to four, and Harvard outshot Columbia 22-5. Lung put the 5-0 dagger through the Lions in the seventieth minute to round out the day.
The Crimson (11-1-3, 5-0-2 Ivy League) sits at No. 14 in the RPI rankings and wraps up conference play with a very compelling case to earn an at-large bid to the NCAA DI Tournament when it comes time for the selection show on Monday evening, despite not earning the conference’s auto bid.
The team’s last two conference games prior to Columbia were both thrilling comeback wins, including a 3-2 win at Princeton which saw sophomore forward Ainsley Ahmadian net the game winner in the seventy-eighth minute, and a 2-1 win at Dartmouth after a strike by junior midfielder Megan Mackey in the eighty-third minute.
Harvard’s last hopes of the Ivy League title were squashed when Brown’s final contest against Yale was canceled and declared a no-contest after a rise in Covid-19 cases within the Yale program. The Crimson needed Brown (11-2-2, 5-0-1 Ivy League) to lose or tie with Yale to win the conference title (in part because of Harvard’s 1-1 draw with the University of Pennsylvania back in September setting them back in conference standings).
Regardless of the conference title, Harvard’s season has been nothing short of stellar. The Crimson is second in the country in points-per-game at 8.67 and has outscored opponents with an average of 2.87 goals per game to opponents’ 0.80. Harvard wields a deep and balanced scoring attack—Ahmadian, sophomore Hannah Bebar, Hasbo, and Griffin all have sixteen points or more and five or more goals, and while Bebar was out against Columbia and likely will be out for the postseason with a leg injury, the Crimson has depth across all positions and has shown so game after game.
In the 2022 campaign, the Crimson owns just a single loss to Boston University, and otherwise has been undefeated, with a notable win over then-No. 17 NC State, well-fought draws with No. 17 Texas-Christian University and No. 28 Ivy League rival Brown, and many other dominant performances, leading to the Crimson’s first undefeated Ivy League season since 2016.
Last year, three Ivy League programs advanced to the NCAA tournament—Brown with the auto-bid and Harvard and Princeton with at-large bids, but Harvard ultimately fell to Wake Forest in the first round. This year the program hopes to return to the big dance and perform against top competition, and the team and Crimson faithful eagerly await their fate for postseason scheduling and will find out the bracket at the selection show on Monday, November 7 at 4:00pm.

With frigid November weather and Starbucks’ holiday drinks comes every sophomore’s favorite existential crisis: declaring a concentration. For all the masochists incredibly hard-working sophomore Flyby writers who just can’t keep their distance from the Science Center (or even farther SEC) and definitely didn’t fall in love with their MQC course assistant, Flyby Blog is proud to present Why I Declared: STEM edition.
Evangeline J. Gilmer: I declared Neuroscience because my nerves hate me and I want to know why! My chronic nerve pain is pretty much always tolerable without painkillers, but lots of people have more serious disorders. And regardless of which end of the pain spectrum people fall into, many unfortunately have one thing in common: the only existing treatments are physical therapy and painkillers. And neither of those are cures. I’m a pre-med life science lover, and I find neuroscience to be the most interesting Harvard life science major not only for the personal connection but also for how ~mysterious~ our own minds are. In other words, the nervous system is the Zayn Malik of the human body and I guess I’m Y/N…?
Raymond Wu: I haven’t declared just yet, but I’m 99.9% sure I’m going to declare Computer Science. And before anyone says anything, yes, I am a victim of the tech propaganda pyramid scheme. But aside from that, I’ve found myself really enjoying programming and even the more theoretical side of computer science, so I’m excited to dig deeper and learn more about the subject. And also to retire at 35.
Anjali Z. Mehta: I declared Applied Math, and I have been reconsidering my choice ever since. I know that I am in for a deeply humbling college experience, but I’ve come to accept the inevitably low GPA and constant late-night psetting. While this decision was certainly surprising to my friends and family, I chose AM as I have truly loved all the math classes I’ve taken so far, especially the ones that have involved literally no numbers. I am very excited to dive even deeper into the wonderful, collaborative, nerdy AM community!
Hailey E. Krasnikov: Honestly, I declared Neuroscience and Economics because I couldn’t pick just one Harvard trope. Am I a finance bro?? Am I premed?? The world will simply never know because I am indeed both. Neuro is just science-y enough for me to feel like a #WomenInStem, while Econ activates my go-getter business persona that I use to convince myself to get up at 5 a.m. to finish my homework that’s due that day.
Tali S. Wong: I declared ESE. Do I hear you asking what the heck is that? Yes, it is a veryyyy small concentration (think-I-know-almost-everyone-else-who-is-declaring small) with an excessively long name. ESE stands for Environmental Science and Engineering. Basically, I love trees, but I also love math. Yes, I have put myself through many painful intro STEM courses. No, I haven't gotten to take many classes in my concentration, but I’m telling myself that I will love it when I get there. Also, somebody has to save the planet.
Annette Kim: I will most likely be declaring Neuroscience because I think it’s cool. I wish I had a more compelling story to tell on why I chose my concentration, but there’s really nothing else to it. I think brains are interesting, and I want to learn more about them. Are my interests prone to change? Most definitely. Am I having a crisis every other day on what to declare? Absolutely. I will simply continue to ~pursue my passions~.
