After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two stem cell researchers at the Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital have filed a lawsuit against the hospital and Harvard Medical School alleging that an investigation into the researchers’ practices by the Medical School and the Brigham is unlawful and damaging to their reputations.
Piero Anversa and Annarosa Leri, a professor and associate professor at the Medical School, respectively, who also work at the Brigham, filed the suit against the hospital and the Medical School in federal court on Dec. 16. The researchers alleged that an investigation into their findings on stem cells is damaging to them and should be aimed at their collaborator, Jan Kajstura, formerly an associate professor at the Medical School.
The lawsuit also names Brigham president Elizabeth G. Nabel and Medical School Dean for Faculty and Research Integrity Gretchen A. Brodnicki as defendants in the case.
The investigation against the plaintiffs, conducted by the Brigham and the Medical School and led by Nabel, picked up in early April after Anversa’s 2011 paper on the regenerative potential of heart stem cells published in journal The Lancet came under fire for alleged scientific misconduct. Since then, two of his papers have come under heavy scrutiny. One, published by Circulation in 2012, has been retracted. Another, published by the Lancet in 2011, was flagged this spring by the journal’s editors when the Medical School disclosed the launch of the investigation.
According to their complaint, Anversa and Leri claim that the Brigham and the Medical School’s investigation into their research was not impartial and unbiased, took place with undue delay, and negatively reflected on the researchers’ careers.
“[The defendants] have caused and are causing ongoing harm to Plaintiffs Dr. Piero Anversa and Dr. Annarosa Leri’s...reputations and careers by conducting a procedurally and legally flawed investigation into alleged research misconduct at a Brigham laboratory,” the complaint says.
The complaint presents what the plaintiffs claim is evidence of misconduct by their collaborator Kajstura, who they allege is solely responsible for problems with data included in their research. Specifically, the complaint accuses Kajstura of doctoring spreadsheet data and altering images in the published papers and claims that neither Anversa nor Leri saw the raw data that ultimately informed the 2012 Circulation paper.
The lawsuit, among other points, also alleges that the investigation into the researchers’ work is itself unlawful. According to the complaint, after finding “substantial evidence” that Kajstura alone may have been responsible for research misconduct, the inquiry panel recommended to continue the investigation “on the theory that Dr. Anversa should be held responsible for arguably negligent failure to investigate Dr. Kajstura’s research misconduct.”
The complaint argues that such a recommendation is “contrary to law” because research misconduct must be “be committed intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly” according to federal law.
Harvard has not yet responded publicly to the lawsuit. But in an emailed statement, Medical School spokesperson David J. Cameron wrote that the Medical School is “fully committed to upholding the highest standards of ethics and to the integrity of our research, and we have full confidence in the rigor of the review process conducted in accordance with applicable regulations and policies.”
Neither Anversa and Leri’s attorney nor Kajstura could be reached for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a 22-day break, the No. 4/4 Harvard men’s ice hockey team (9-1-2, 5-1-2 ECAC) will carry the nation’s highest winning percentage into an exhibition against the Russian Red Stars at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center on Sunday. Here’s what you need to know about the game.
Who are the Russian Red Stars?
The Red Stars are an all-star team of 17-to-21-year-old players from the Molodezhnaya Hokkeinaya Liga (MHL). That’s Russian for “Junior Hockey League."
Founded in 2009 to serve as the primary developmental circuit for the Kontinental Hockey League, the MHL currently consists of 39 clubs in seven countries (Russia-32 teams, Belarus-2, Austria-1, Czech Republic-1, Kazakhstan-1, Latvia-1, and Ukraine-1).
MHL all-star teams have faced off against North American collegiate and junior squads in late December and early January every year since 2010-2011. Through the 2013-2014 season, the Red Stars are 3-14 all-time against American college teams.
What to Watch For
Harvard will use the exhibition as an opportunity to tune up for intercollegiate play and, maybe, work some new faces into the rotation.
Sunday could offer Harvard fans their first look at freshman goaltender Merrick Madsen. The solid—and sometimes brilliant—play of junior Steve Michalek has kept the 6’5” Philadelphia Flyers pick on the bench all season. Michalek’s .944 save percentage is third among Division I goaltenders.
A number of skaters will likely come off the scratch lists. The biggest question mark remains first-line sophomore center Alex Kerfoot, who missed Harvard’s Princeton-Quinnipiac road trip with a reportedly minor injury.
Sophomore defenseman Victor Newell and junior forward Colin Blackwell have been in-and-out of the line up since coming off injured reserve, so the duo may use the exhibition to test its ability to remain on the ice. Sunday could also mark the return of sophomore defenseman Kevin Guiltinan, who has appeared in just one game since injuring his back during a preseason weight lift.
Leading Scorers
Sunday’s game will not count towards the Crimson’s official stats, but Jimmy Vesey will try to keep his scoring streak alive on the other side of the break. The junior forward has scored at least a point in all 12 of Harvard’s games this season and leads the team with nine goals and 17 points.
Maintaining that clip could be a challenge for Vesey, who had eight goals through his first 12 games last season before being held to five goals through his final 19. Harvard’s steady and consistent start to this season, however, suggests that a different result may be in order in 2015.
Junior Patrick McNally, meanwhile, leads all Division I defensemen with 1.25 points per game and is tied with Kerfoot for the team lead in assists (11).
Through 31 games last season, Crimson defensemen had combined for a conference-worst four goals as a unit. This season, McNally alone has already matched that figure, while junior co-captain Max Everson, sophomore Clay Anderson, and junior Brayden Jaw have also found the back of the net from the blue line.
Last Time Out
The Crimson routed the Red Stars, 9-3, powered by five straight first-period goals at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center on Dec. 29, 2013.
Vesey recorded a hat trick and an assist, while Kerfoot also contributed four points with a goal and three helpers. Twelve Harvard skaters recorded at least one point.
