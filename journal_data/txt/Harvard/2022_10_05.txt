After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Perhaps it is inevitable that a horror movie titled “Barbarian” should prompt its viewer to ask who after all is the “real” barbarian. It certainly feels obligatory, and surely no self-respecting horror picture in the year 2022 would be worth its salt if it failed to suggest, dear viewer, that the true barbarian was you all along. But what is important about Zach Cregger’s new feature is that it does not forget, in the meantime, to be scary. It is a bona fide horror film, which, in the contemporary landscape, makes it something of an oasis.
Given the extent to which “Barbarian”’s essential structure consists of a procession of crescendoing horrors, it is best to go into the film more or less blind. Still, it is probably not giving too much away to say that the film begins in that most classic of horror settings: a haunted house, on a dark and stormy night. The movie’s first shot, depicting this house, is theatrically heightened and not exactly naturalistic. It makes for a bold opening, one that announces that the picture to follow will be unabashed in its genre.
And so it is, indulging deliciously in shadowy spaces and poorly-lit passages down which its protagonists would be well-advised not to go. Though the particular horrors “Barbarian” serves up are original, its basic elements are familiar, and the picture executes them well: Georgina Campbell performs ably as a tough heroine whose curiosity makes the viewer want to scream at her not to go in there, for God’s sake, what are you thinking. (At one point, some Peelean survival instinct prompts her to step away from the danger with a quite sensible “Nope.” Seconds later, this instinct vanishes.) Bill Skarsgård is suspensefully, delightfully ambiguous until he very suddenly isn’t. Justin Long — but it is best to forget, going into the film, that Mr. Long is in it; here the woods are thick with spoilers.
It is Justin Long’s character, AJ, who is responsible for its unpleasantly starchy aftertaste of didacticism. “Barbarian” is perhaps most fundamentally a chronicle of violence against women, and it is at its most affecting, both dramatically and in its horror, when it keeps its discourse about this theme subtextual. AJ’s arc is the movie’s strongest gesture toward overt commentary, which is why, though watching it play out is entertaining and compelling, one feels — as the credits roll — the vague sense of having just read a particularly long Twitter thread.
Still, this does not wholly damn “Barbarian,” and it certainly does not consign it to the ranks of that “elevated horror” dreck, like 2018’s “Hereditary,” — which uses ostentatious shot construction and heavy-handed theme deployment as a substitute for good filmmaking and real scares. “Barbarian” does not imagine itself too good to be scary, nor is it ashamed to be a horror movie. It unfolds itself with energetic surety and an engaging structural boldness that makes the picture. The film’s single best moment, about midway through, is not scary at all but is so formally audacious as to inspire delight (viewers should bear in mind Marx’s comment that all history occurs twice: first as tragedy, then as farce).
And, as a chronicle of violence against women, as a commentary on such violence and its barbarity (a concept that, no viewer should forget, comes to us as an initially ethnic one, coined by the Greeks and then adopted by the Romans to designate those not like themselves), “Barbarian” works precisely because of its formal boldness and shameless horror-ness. If the picture were unfree in its movement and timid in its genre, it would be stale and unscary; if it were stale and unscary, it would be without dramatic weight; if it were without dramatic weight, it would be without thematic weight.
“Barbarian” is not a perfect movie. Some of the scares are contrived; many of the plot twists are predictable. But at least it tries, and in this respect it stands apart from certain horror films of late made with a self-conscious artistry that fails to realize that the real barbarity is itself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Singer and composer Ali A. Sethi ‘06 recently returned to campus to perform at the Mittal Institute’s celebration of 75 years of Pakistani-Indian “azadi,” or independence from British rule on Sep. 14. At his campus appearances his musical genius, political reflections, and inviting charm were on full display.
“I’ve started saying this like a mantra: folk is woke. Especially as brown kids, we’re often searching for what we can tap into in our ancestral culture, in our inheritance, something that can nourish our contemporary consciousness and quest for an identity that feels whole, yet liberated,” Sethi said in an interview with The Harvard Crimson, reflecting on his process as a writer and artist of color. “I find that folk traditions of South Asia are some of the most flexible, fluid, mystical, philosophically supple traditions in human history. That’s what my undergrad years at Harvard taught me. That’s what my immersive apprenticeship in Hindustani classical sangeet taught me. That’s what my understanding of poetry has taught me. And that’s what my life has taught me.”
Sethi is known for his skill in amalgamating Hindustani raga with contemporary, Western beats and harmony. In the interview, he talked about growing up when the internet was still nascent, in the unique musical sphere of Lahore in the late ‘90s and early 2000s.
“There was music of the Sufi shrines in the city, a very vernacular form of music,” Sethi said of Lahore and its influence. “There was Bollywood music coming in, and there was the azaan [Islamic call to prayer] which you would hear five times a day. But at the same time there were cassettes and CDs, random bits of Western pop music, that would flood the bazaars.”
He recalled a moment in his early childhood, when he picked up a RuPaul CD that had found its way to a Lahori bazaar. “I had no idea who RuPaul was, but I picked it up, I listened, and I was immediately like, ‘This is me, this is my jam,” he said. “I was going around the house saying ‘shantay shantay!’”
Indeed, Sethi attributes his sound today to being immersed in this unique musical environment and to the fact that he did not have formal musical training until the age of 17. “I just played the hell out of all this music, and learned it by heart. I would recite bits of alaap from a qawwali, or a bit of a Bollywood song from an audio cassette — it was all happily mixed up for me,” Sethi said. “Now is the first time in my life that I’m starting to become more aware of the difference in music theories of Western and Eastern sound. But even still, I find myself constantly mixing things up…and that’s something I don’t want to lose.”
Sethi musingly reflected on the creative process behind his song, “Khabar-e-Tahayyur-e-Ishq,” or “The Astonishing Tale of Love.” Penned by 18th century Urdu poet Siraj Aurangabadi, this ghazal is traditionally performed in qawwali form, as a sort of call and response. But Sethi’s rearrangement is wholly something new: The instrumentation, produced by frequent collaborator Noah Georgeson, features emotive strings, harp, and Sethi’s voice in an expansively haunting range. Its composition amalgamates and inverts genres; in a way that even Sethi could not quite wrap his head around. “I think I was channeling a bit of raga and I think I was channeling a bit of Jeff Buckley’s version of ‘Hallelujah,’ too,” he said. “There’s a place where they meet in my brain. Professor [Ali] Asani sent me the poem and the story of the poet.” As he trailed off, he began to hum the melody for “Khabar.” It became clear that his music-making process is organic and spiritual; the music flows out of him.
“Yakjehti Mein,” or “In Solidarity,” is another song of Sethi’s, written in the particular framework of solidarity with Palestine. The song is a patchwork of two poems by celebrated Pakistani poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz, who wrote against tyranny in a different context. Indeed, politics are deeply woven into much of Sethi’s music. On what embodying solidarity means to him, he spoke about the cultural concept of the mehfil. “Attending a music concert of traditional Urdu poetry has always been a space of solidarity,” Sethi said. “A ‘mehfil’ is an intimate recital of music, there’s a call and answer dynamic going on between the performer and audience. It’s an unplugged intimate setting in which you sing and you chat and you drink…wine, or chai, depending on where in the world you are.” A cheeky smile spread across his face as he spoke on the importance of mehfil in our culture, a form of communal gathering dedicated to poetry and musical recitation.
“It’s a super traditional environment and yet an incredibly freeing environment too. A space for everyone to let their hair down, to sway, to let their inner spirit course through — and it’s about, through metaphors, finding a shared space of emotional vulnerability, of sensual license, of a politic of the soul. And then when I got here to Harvard, and I took history courses and I went to Lamont to look at videos of Nina Simone performing with a piano at the height of the civil rights movement, I would think, ‘Wow, this is related, in some way, to our tradition, in which music is not just entertainment, but it feeds and nourishes our soul…and it’s a kind of congregation. You’re rehearsing a community through beauty, and not conformity.’”
He spoke of the power derived from mehfil in his early years, growing up in Pakistan during a time when it felt like there was a binary of how you chose to live your life. “You could either be westernized and secular and rejecting of your culture; or you could become orthodox and be full of this desire to purge your culture of other influences,” Sethi said. “And this was that other space; music and poetry offered a third space — one of solidarity — which is why I was so drawn to it.”
In the past year, “Pasoori,” the latest addition to Sethi’s musical oeuvre, has shot his name into global stardom: it became the first Pakistani song to top Spotify’s ‘Viral Top 50 Global’ chart and starred in an episode of Disney’s “Miss Marvel.”
Sethi spoke to the alluring form of “Pasoori,” in which he seems to have landed on a formula that invites recitation, even among audiences who may not understand the actual lyrics of the song. “It’s like some of the Punjabi limericks I learned as a kid, which were half-nonsensical, but kind of magical,” Sethi said. “They were built on themselves, and became these fabulous myths with the head of one thing and the tail of another. I think that’s kind of what Pasoori is, a magical being…and there’s something about the structure of it that dazzles and asks for recitation.”
In addition to the infectious beat and stunning vocals, the music video for “Pasoori” — which features a pre-Partition aesthetic, dazzling folk attire, and four forms of traditional dance — has been a huge part of its popularity. And Sethi conceived the visuals for it.
“There are all these epistemologies of love in South Asian culture, which are genderfluid, non-discriminatory, which transcend the usual divisions of caste, language, and class, and go into this place of multiplicity. It’s a chimera: where one is many and many is one. It’s like an acid trip. I really wanted to gesture at this mystical strain of South Asian artwork and philosophy, because that part of our ancestral culture can engage in a fruitful dialogue with contemporary discourse.”
There was another, perhaps more unexpected, source of inspiration for the Pasoori video: TikTok.
“Because it’s a short-form technology, I feel like everyone is using hieroglyphic-like gestures of dance, to start a trend; they’re inviting you to replicate their moves,” Sethi said. “This is what we’ve been doing in South Asian classical dance since forever; in Bharatnatyam, Odissi, Kathak, we do exactly that, communicate by gesture.”
Sethi also just published a piece in the Guardian on the 75th anniversary of Partition, co-authoring it with Indian author Pankaj Mishra. He spoke on its relevance to Pasoori and the state of South Asia today. “It’s about how music offers, especially to the younger South Asian generations, a kind of non-toxic heritage, another avenue to converse and connect and find an alternative pathway to identity that is not necessarily organized religion or nationalism, or anything exclusionary, but rather something that works to root and unite,” Sethi said. “Pasoori was me trying to enact some of that; it was the thesis I never finished as an undergrad, that I never submitted to Professor Asani!”
In conversation, Sethi began musing on what South Asian food dish might best embody his persona. Laughingly, papdi chaat was brought up. He wholeheartedly agreed with the comparison.
“I’m a little bit tart, and I’m a little bit sweet,” he said. “There’s also something very camp and baroque about [papdi chaat] — it’s a little extra, I love it. Campy and baroque…those are the two qualities I aspire to most as a performer. Absolutely write that!”
Through the way he talked about collaborating with other artists and the stories behind his music, it became clear that Sethi is a dreamer. When asked to share his greatest dream, at the moment, he gave a poignant response.
“Aarya, you are the latest manifestation of it,” Sethi said. “When I was an undergrad, Mira Nair came back to accept an award, and I met her for the first time, and now we’re friends who do Zoom riyaz every week…But I remember her saying, ‘When I was a student here in the 70s, there were very few of us here. And now there are more of us here.’ And now, I’m sitting here talking with you, and it’s so amazing to me that here we are, talking about our foods and our music and this is not marginal anymore. This is a part of world culture.”
Sethi’s starry-eyed vision of the future of South Asian art and its place in the global sphere felt like a warm embrace. He shared even greater belief in the diaspora, and its potential to sustain, nourish, and grow cultural art.
“I have started to feel that the South Asian diaspora is a much more fertile, progressive, and inspiring space for me as an artist than mainland South Asia right now, where there are a lot of politics of exclusion going on. And some of that does carry over here to the diaspora, of course, but there is a kind of idealism and this energy in the diaspora that I find completely inspiring,” Sethi said. “I’m connecting with it more and more, working with more diasporic visual artists, filmmakers, fashion-people, makeup artists, writers, musicians, poets. They’re so brave, they’re so generous. They want to connect with each other and they’re so proud of what they come from. My dream is the South Asian diaspora.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Sept. 26, Grammy Award winning producer and rapper Pi’erre Bourne visited Boston’s House of Blues as a pit stop on his “Good Movie World Tour.” The tour is promoting his Sept. 2 release, “Good Movie,” the follow up to his 2021 sophomore album, “The Life of Pi’erre 5.” Despite the album having been released for only a little over three weeks, loyal fans screamed all the words to Pi’erre’s newest songs. Sporting a comfortable flannel and casual black pants, the producer-rapper effortlessly captured his audience’s attention.
A whopping four openers entertained the antsy crowd as it waited for Pi’erre to take the stage. Trill, Jelly, Chavo, and Sharc – members of Pi’erre Bourne’s record label SossHouse – got fans hyped up, urging them to jump and even asking them to “open up six mosh pits.” After four exciting performances, an eager audience begged Pi’erre to come out on stage, chanting his well-known producer tag, “Yo Pi’erre, you wanna come out here?” The talkative crowd suddenly hushed and then screamed as the stage lights turned purple and Pi’erre finally made his appearance.
Pi’erre started off his set with a number of high-energy songs off of “Good Movie,” such as “Sosshouse Party” and “Psane (feat. Don Toliver),” which had the crowd going crazy. The lively atmosphere only fueled his performance as he interacted with the audience, walking across the stage and taking videos on his fans’ phones. He balanced out this energy with slower, more mellow beats like “Where You Going,” which the audience enjoyed with the lights off and iPhone flashlights on. The most energetic part of the concert was, of course, when he played his older, more well-known hits such as “Practice”, “Switching Lanes”, and “Poof” from “The Life of Pi’erre 5” and “The Life of Pi’erre 4”. His iconic lyrics could be heard loud and clear amidst the several mosh pits forming in the crowd. True connection could be seen not only between Pi’erre and his fans, but also between the fans themselves. The immaculate vibe was evident as strangers could be spotted dancing and singing the words to each other, lost in the magic of Pi’erre’s beats.
Halfway through the show, Pi’erre stepped away from the stage to delight his audience with some bangers that he produced, such as Playboi Carti’s “Magnolia” and Lil Uzi Vert’s “Bean (Kobe) [feat. Chief Keef].” Fans did not miss a beat, moshing and jumping around so much it felt like the room was shaking. Chavo also made a surprising reappearance on stage, performing “Left Right Wrist” — produced by Pi’erre — among other hits.
To close the evening, Pi’erre came back on stage to close out his show with beloved numbers “4U” and “Drunk & Nasty (feat. Sharc)” from “Life of Pi’erre 5”, which ended the night on a high. Fans left the House of Blues with full hearts and ringing ears.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My mother moved to the Northeast about 20 years ago, far from her original home in Guatemala, and similarly distant from her 13 other siblings who settled in California and the Midwest. We visit this side of my family irregularly — spring break in Oklahoma being the most recent occasion. My time in Tulsa last March was spent trying to make up for the fact that my Spanish is laughable, that I attend an “elite” university, that I live in Cambridge, and that I have fairer skin than my cousins. My Hispanic identity is at my core, yet it remains something I keep having to prove, define, and reflect on.
The Hispanic community, too, has had a difficult time trying to define themselves. For decades, it has been impossible to find a widely accepted pan-ethnic label for this artificially constructed group. Although the majority of Hispanics prefer to identify with their country of origin, there is a practical (oftentimes political) need for an all-encompassing label. In the past couple of years, the categorization “Latinx” has arrived to fulfill this need in progressive spaces — everywhere from college campuses to the corporate world. This is despite the fact that only 3 percent of Hispanic adults prefer using the term Latinx to describe themselves; even more damning, 40 percent of Hispanics are offended by it. As a baseline heuristic: if almost half a population is offended by the term used to describe it, maybe it warrants a second look.
This re-evaluation has already begun. Democrats are starting to view Latinx as an electoral liability. Joe Biden used the term in a speech last June, yet the descriptor is nowhere to be found in the most recent version of his 9,000-word “Agenda for the Latino Community.” The League of United Latin American Citizens has removed Latinx from all its official documents. At Harvard, substitutes such as “Latine” and “Latinidad” have been proposed as defensible alternatives — just last Thursday the Harvard Institute of Politics posted an infographic explaining the linguistic merits of Latine.
Although genuine momentum against Latinx is emerging, the term still has a hold on Harvard’s campus. This September, the fifth annual Latinx Convocation took place; Hispanic groups on campus such as Fuerza Latina and Latinxs in Finance and Technology still use the verbiage on all their mailing lists.
My own distaste for Latinx follows the line of many other commentators. The term screams ignorance of Hispanic culture, language, and priorities. Latinx is predominantly used by younger, college-educated, and progressive Hispanics. In other words, the 3 percent of Hispanics that prefer the term are not emblematic of the broader demographic. More important than the anglicization inherent in Latinx’s spelling — or even its failure to catch on in non-elite settings — is the fact that it actively offends a serious proportion of Hispanics. I am hard-pressed to think of another widely accepted term that could get away with this, let alone be considered the politically correct appellation.
Despite my broad concerns with Latinx, I don’t necessarily think it should be abandoned on campus. Hispanics at Harvard can choose any term they like to describe themselves — even if 97 percent of Hispanics nationwide wouldn’t agree with their choice. A lot of this cultural disparity boils down to wealth, stemming from the fact that socioeconomic diversity at Harvard is severely lacking. Even the recommended solutions, Latine and Latinidad, are far from what Hispanics around the country would want. The burden of this embarrassing incongruity, though, is not on progressive students who are concerned about gender inclusivity. Rather, it rests on Harvard to admit a more economically diverse, and thus culturally diverse, group of students.
Even though Latinx is just a symptom of larger cultural dissonance, its use still sends a clear message. Personally, I refuse to be labeled Latinx. A subtle wave of guilt washes over me every time I’m obligated to check the Latinx box on internship applications or advisory forms. I get the opportunity to be Latinx — while my Latino cousins do not. Being in an environment where the term is prominent is itself a privilege that most Hispanics do not have. Being labeled Latinx cements every one of the 1,500 physical and figurative miles from Cambridge to Tulsa.
It has been a longstanding fear of mine that I will become disconnected from my Hispanic family. Matriculating to Harvard has only amplified these concerns. The Ivy League bubble only serves to complement my other non-traditional Hispanic qualities. Latinx, at times, feels like the final straw. The last step to the top of the Hispanic Ivory Tower. It’s one I just cannot take.

Reiterated in socially conscious spaces until it makes me want to gouge my ears out: “Nonbinary people don’t owe you androgyny!”
I’m sure people who say this are supportive and generally understanding of the plight of gender in modern American society. Perhaps a student in a Women, Gender, and Sexuality seminar says this to snaps around the table. Perhaps they were themself filled with nonbinary rage at the machine of society that demands this exacting display of equal male and female characteristics from us.
I bought into this rage, heavy, when I was younger and starting to toe the edges of gender; I didn’t owe anyone else a window into my gender identity. Now, I am a cynic: To be broadly seen as nonbinary, you must present as androgynous.
***
I refuse to argue the existence of nonbinary gender identity. Eighty-two percent of transgender individuals have considered suicide, as have 94 percent of nonbinary individuals; 40 percent of each group has attempted.
The existence of 1.2 million people who identify as nonbinary in the United States alone, regardless of whether that identity can be considered “real” (and really, what is real when we talk social constructs), is enough to warrant solving the issues they face. We kill trans and nonbinary people with our inaction. Thousands upon thousands of bodies slump over for the last time, as we argue over whether we even see them.
***
There is a gap between self-defined identity, which describes how one internally identifies, and other-imposed identity, which refers to how they are externally perceived. In a typical example concerning race, one might self-define as consider themself Chinese because they were raised in a culturally Chinese household that celebrated the Lunar New Year and split mooncakes during the Mid-Autumn Festival. That same person might be widely perceived as some flavor of vaguely East Asian based on the tint of their skin or the skew of their eyes.
In determining other-imposed gender identity, we are evaluated in accordance with the established looks of men and women. We all know what male and female look like — or at least, we think we do, according to the notions of gender expression developed by our surrounding societies. Every recorded civilization has had at least the two genders of male and female. Gender has a look refined over human history, as conveyed by hair, makeup, clothing, size, stature, bone structure, et cetera. Men have muscles, body hair, and rugged faces; women have curves, long silky hair, and a softness to their edges.
I can’t escape this judgment. No one has ever seen me, with my medium wolf cut, winged eyeliner, and high-waisted pants, and thought anything other than “woman.”
If I wanted them to think otherwise, I would need to change parts of me. I’d cut flesh from my chest, build structure in my jaw, shave my head, grow five more inches. I’d flee my own body.
***
People describe others with their own perceptions, until they learn that others’ self-defined identities differ, and they care enough to update their perceptions. Human beings are duck testable: If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck — and to call a duck anything other than a duck is ridiculous.
Even at Harvard, where students campaign for social justice, the duck test is used without asking whether someone identifies as a duck first. The most socially progressive people I know have defaulted to “she/her” for me. I don’t blame them for it. It’s easy to advocate for respecting gender identities at large; it’s hard to deliver the requisite respect in individual situations when the right answer seems already too apparent, when we’ve been raised to assume that gender is generally obvious.
We could use neutral pronouns for each other until otherwise specified. In theory, this would solve all thorniness; in practice, no one ever does it. Only around half of all Americans are even somewhat comfortable using gender-neutral pronouns when specifically asked to do so; it seems reasonable to assume that the percentage of Americans comfortable with using gender-neutral pronouns even before being asked to do so is much lower.
Overall, the trendline for national comfort with gender neutrality is depressingly static. Coupled with the disinclination to explain one’s entire identity to a new group of peers, the duck test seems unlikely to leave us anytime soon, at Harvard or beyond.
***
If you want to be widely perceived as nonbinary, you need to present like the single socially-understood look. Nonbinary people might not have the same history of civilizations established on male and female to define what our gender identity looks like — but we have a look nonetheless, defined in the space between male and female.
It’s androgyny: the perfect blend between masculine and feminine. Think of every “gender envy” Pinterest board of skinny, pale, smudged-out teens with dark hair and worried knuckles. You want to be perceived as neither male nor female, but neutrally? You need a neutral body.
Never mind the fact that this might not be how you personally identify. Nonbinary identity rarely files perfectly down the center of the male-female continuum. Rather, nonbinary identity encapsulates a large swathe of gender identities, from feeling like both man and woman in different amounts, to feeling no gender at all. It’s a three-dimensional identity that we attempt to collapse down to the two-dimensional scale between male and female.
Never mind the fact that you might not want to change the body you grew up in, which has served you for all these years. Many nonbinary people do not want to pursue hormone therapy or gender-affirming procedures. They are not nonbinary souls “stuck in the wrong bodies,” as the popular myths would claim; their bodies are their own, made nonbinary by their identities.
Finally, never mind the fact that body change to the androgynous ideal might not even be possible. A thin, white, childlike body is unachievable by much of the nonbinary population due to genetics alone. For many nonbinary people, striving towards an androgynous body is a hopeless act towards an unreachable fantasy.
The fantasy isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, either. Even if you fit the model of androgyny to a tee, you are not guaranteed an other-imposed nonbinary identity. People still perceive you without your clarification all the time, while passing you on the street or participating beside you in section. Androgyny only works as shorthand for nonbinary if the audience’s duck tests are updated to recognize this latest model of nonbinary appearance. You’re entrusting the reception of your identity to people who, statistically speaking, are in the 73 percent of Americans who have heard little to nothing about nonbinary identity. One in five Americans know someone who identifies as nonbinary; likely even fewer grasp the nuances of how that person conceptualizes their complex gender identity.
Here is the crux of the nonbinary tragedy: We need to perform to be recognized, that performance might not be how we want to be recognized in the first place, and even then, the performance doesn’t always work to generate recognition.
We want to be perceived as we perceive ourselves, so badly. But the journey is treacherous, consuming our bodies and agency for a chance at public acceptance. Maybe that’s why 94 percent of us want to kill ourselves: It’s the last act of agency we can afford in a system that grants us none.
***
I do not want nonbinary people to die. I want nothing but euphoria and gentle endings for my nonbinary siblings.
History bears witness to how people like me have tried for a kinder future. Activists have redefined gender neutrality and resisted gender norms since the 1970s. Younger generations are rewiring how we think about gender beyond the man-woman binary.
But we need more. I am tired of waiting for the dead to accumulate. Perhaps it’s too existentially difficult for us to decouple the body from the identity, to wipe our mechanisms of perception, such that nonbinary people are freed from their Sisyphean torture. But we can control the extent to which these perceptions are verbalized. We can default to gender-neutral language. We can refrain from commenting on each others’ bodies. We can change the behemoth of culture one surface-level action at a time, until it becomes second nature and itself culture.
If we can create this culture change anywhere, it’s at the microcosm of Harvard, a campus so overwhelmingly liberal that we had a near-scandal over the lack of conservative voices. Use “they/them” before anyone else. Check your biases before making assumptions about others’ gender identities based on their bodies. Do it for the at least 2.7 percent of current Harvard students who identify as nonbinary. Do it to save lives.
***
This LGBTQ+ History Month, as we celebrate the queer trailblazers who have carved our passage towards civil rights into the deepest granite of time, I also want us to look to the future birthed by today’s history. I want us to make the choices now that will lead to broad acceptance of nonbinary people and reduce trans and nonbinary death down the line.
Until then, nonbinary people are saddled with this ugly tragedy, the dichotomy of choice between self-respect and others’ respect. I don’t want to owe you androgyny, but you’re going to ask for it anyways.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lawyers from the Legal Defense Fund spoke to Harvard affiliates at a pro-affirmative action “teach-in” hosted by a student group in the Science Center on Tuesday.
The event comes four weeks before the Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in an affirmative action lawsuit against Harvard. The suit, brought by the anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions, alleges that Harvard College discriminates against Asian American applicants by considering race in its admissions process.
The “teach-in,” hosted by the Harvard Affirmative Action Coalition, featured student speakers along with community organizers and lawyers from LDF who discussed the lawsuit and the legal history of affirmative action.
Chelsea Wang ’25, a student leader for the Harvard Affirmative Action Coalition, said she was partially driven to help organize the event because she “wants to help dispel the model minority myth.”
“I don’t want Asians to be used as a wedge or a pawn to further a white supremacist agenda,” Wang said.
Edward J. Blum, the president of SFFA, who has led an array of legal challenges to affirmative action, has said his suits “are rescue missions for the colorblind legal principles that hold together Americans of all races and ethnicities.”
In August, the Legal Defense Fund filed a brief on behalf of 25 Harvard student organizations asking the Supreme Court to uphold affirmative action in the SFFA case.
“It’s always so inspiring to come and be in communication and be in conversation with our clients and also other Harvard students,” said Michaele N. Turnage Young, LDF’s senior legal counsel.
The Supreme Court rejected a request in August from LDF for 10 minutes of oral argument time in the Harvard case, which is being heard on the same day as a similar suit brought by SFFA against the University of North Carolina.
“It’s vitally important that the perspective of the thousands of current Harvard students that we represent be available to the court,” Turnage Young said.
Justices are set to hear the case on Oct. 31.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Marking 25 years since its founding, Harvard Chabad announced last month the establishment of a $5 million dollar gift toward the Harvard Chabad Endowment for Jewish Leadership.
Jackie and Omri Dahan donated the $5 million gift, which endows Harvard Chabad founder and president Rabbi Hirschy Zarchi’s position and establishes the Dahan Fellowship for Jewish Leadership. Harvard Chabad is a center for Jewish life located on Banks St., which hosts programming tied to Jewish tradition and regularly provides Shabbat and other holiday meals to students.
Zarchi described the gift as an “extraordinary act of generosity and investment really in the future of the Jewish community at Harvard and beyond.”
“One piece of the gift is to endow the position to ensure that the resources are there at this work and this work can be sustained for generations to come, that’s one component,” Zarchi said. “The other is the launching of a fellowship and fellowship program that will shape an educated generation of leaders who will lead, anchored from Jewish wisdom and Jewish texts and Jewish models of leadership throughout history.”
Zarchi added that many students who engage in Chabad programming do not come from traditional Jewish backgrounds.
“For many, Harvard Chabad is their first independent opportunity to engage Jewishly and often their first compelling Jewish experience,” he said.
Zarchi said his role, following the endowment, will not inherently change, nor will the organization’s identity. Rather, the endowment will allow students to “connect, to be educated and to be exposed and enriched by the great ideas of Judaism and its texts."
The endowment will additionally help fund a fellowship program for students, who Zarchi said will be a “future generation of leaders.”
“This gift concretizes in a very substantial way a focus that manifests in a very defined and organized, structured program to specifically identify students who are talented but also driven and focused and dedicated to making a difference in the world,” Zarchi said. “And to see to it that their form of leadership will be very much anchored in and influenced by the values and models of leadership as articulated in the Torah.”
Zarchi said the program will have implications beyond Harvard.
“Harvard, as you know, is a community that sees itself as educating future leaders,” he said. “For us, the question is, ‘Will they be Jewish leaders at a time where leadership is so lacking broadly, including within the Jewish community?’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over a dozen anti-war activists staged a protest against Harvard Kennedy School professor Meghan L. O’Sullivan Tuesday morning, disrupting a class she was teaching to first-year master’s of public policy students.
The protesters denounced O’Sullivan’s affiliation with Raytheon Technologies, a weapons manufacturing firm, and her role in the Bush administration during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
O’Sullivan served as deputy national security advisor for Iraq and Afghanistan in the Bush administration prior to joining the Harvard Kennedy School. She currently sits on Raytheon’s board of directors.
The protestors, most of whom were not affiliated with Harvard, burst into the classroom chanting “Meghan O’Sullivan, you can’t hide, we can see your war crimes” and “When missiles fly, people die, and O’Sullivan’s profits multiply,” while holding up a banner critical of O’Sullivan in front of the class.
HKS security personnel and the Harvard University Police Department responded to the demonstration, but no arrests were made as the protestors left campus on their own. It remains unclear how the protestors entered the Kennedy School.
Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf wrote in a statement Tuesday evening that the school “encourages constructive discourse, including dissent and protest.”
“But students and teachers have the right to be heard in the classroom and to listen to others in the classroom, and disruption of those interactions hurts learning and is not tolerated,” Elmendorf said.
O’Sullivan declined to comment on the protest and the activists’ criticisms.
The protest at HKS was co-organized by Resist and Abolish the Military Industrial Complex — an activist group that has previously staged protests against Raytheon in Rhode Island and Cambridge — and United Against War and Militarism, an anti-imperialist organization.
A RAM INC spokesperson criticized Harvard’s decision to employ O’Sullivan as a professor because of her past work for the U.S. government and her affiliation with Raytheon.
“We want to expose the fact that Harvard Kennedy — in spite of the image it’s putting forward — is employing someone who profits every time bombs or missiles are dropped or launched at Palestine and Yemen,” the spokesperson said.
Quint Forgey, an HKS student who was in the classroom when protestors burst inside, said that “the class was definitely shaken” following the protest.
While the class was not canceled as a result of the incident, O’Sullivan did not return to teaching the planned material, according to Forgey. Instead, O’Sullivan and the students spent the rest of class time discussing the disruption.
“It transitioned into a frank, honest, and open dialogue between the students in the classroom and Professor O’Sullivan about her time in the Bush administration and students’ various reactions to the episode,” Forgey said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Institute of Politics last week launched the “IOP One Fund,” a new initiative that will provide support for College students and student organizations to engage in public service.
Students can apply for up to $100 in funding to support various expenses related to public service, such as purchasing business attire, organizing student-led events, and traveling for professional purposes. The fund also offers non-monetary support for students and student organizations by offering event services including event space, speakers, and microphones.
IOP President Janna E. Ramadan ’23 and IOP Vice President Tabitha L. Escalante ’23 lauded the new program in a statement Sunday.
“It is no secret that barriers to public service exist beyond unpaid internships,” they wrote. “For college students, there exist major financial barriers to accessing workplace attire or travel costs to important conferences or interviews.”
“We’ve experienced it ourselves and it is our hope that this fund will alleviate this burden for other students as they endeavor to pursue long-term public service journeys – at and beyond Harvard,” Ramadan and Escalante added.
IOP Treasurer Stephanie Lin ’24, who helped spearhead the new fund, said it seeks to fill a void following the dissolution of the Undergraduate Council, which she said left students without a way to receive some types of funding. Undergraduate students voted last spring to eliminate the UC in favor of the Harvard Undergraduate Association, which began meeting this semester.
During a Sept. 27 meeting of the IOP’s Student Advisory Committee, Lin said, some members raised concerns that student organizations might lean on the IOP for resources too much, using it to replace funding the organizations should be receiving from student government.
The IOP One Fund is supported by the IOP’s budget, Lin said. Student group funding dispersed by the UC came from money allocated by the Harvard College Dean of Students Office.
“Our student budget was created for the express purpose of supporting the Institute’s mission, which is why we’ve had to work this fund in a way where we can support the Harvard community, but still in a way that the student budget was initially created for,” Lin said.
The current version of the One IOP Fund only allows individual students to apply for monetary funding, while both student organizations and individuals are eligible for non-monetary support.
“We integrated everyone’s concerns and we kind of went through, bullet by bullet, each of the things that were raised and how to best address it,” Lin said. “As a team, we came to this current iteration of the fund, which very much has been updated by the feedback from our Student Advisory Committee.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 6, 2022 at 2:48 a.m.
Carolyn R. Bertozzi ’88 was one of three scientists awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry “for the development of click chemistry and bioorthogonal chemistry,” the Nobel Committee announced Wednesday morning.
Bertozzi is the first alum of Harvard College to win the chemistry prize since Martin Karplus ’51 won the prize in 2013. She is also the first alumna of the College to win a Nobel Prize and the eighth woman to win the prize in chemistry.
Click chemistry allows scientists to snap together molecular building blocks into complex molecules. Chemists K. Barry Sharpless and Morten P. Meldal concurrently developed click chemistry and share the prize with Bertozzi. Sharpless, who completed his postdoctoral work at Harvard, previously won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2001.
Bertozzi, now a professor at Stanford University, “took click chemistry to a new dimension and began using it to map cells,” according to the Nobel Committee.
“Her bioorthogonal reactions are now contributing to more targeted cancer treatments, among many other applications,” the committee wrote in a press release announcing the prize recipients.
Steven G. Boxer, the chair of Stanford’s chemistry department, lauded Bertozzi’s accomplishments in a statement to The Crimson.
“She represents all the best at the interface of Chemistry and Biology,” Boxer wrote.
“Harvard can be proud, Berkeley too (where she was a grad student and for a time on the faculty), UCSF (where she was a postdoc) and, of course, Stanford.”
In an interview with The Crimson, Bertozzi said that she was woken up by a phone call from the Nobel Committee at 1:43 a.m. Wednesday.
“I looked at the number, and it was a weird international number — and it's from Sweden — and I saw that, I was like, oh, no, no, no, no, no,” she said. “So, suddenly, the chair of the Nobel committee is on the phone congratulating me and giving me the news.”
Bertozzi — who had initially planned to pursue medicine when she was an undergrad — said Harvard was influential in her path to becoming a chemist.
After taking Chemistry 17: Principles of Organic Chemistry, Bertozzi “killed the premed idea,” she said.
“I just knew I wanted to be an organic chemist, and Harvard did that for me,” she said. “Harvard brought me and organic chemistry together.”
“I would want to be left alone on Friday and Saturday night just to read o-chem books in the library,” she added.
While at Harvard, Bertozzi, a Quincy House resident, was inducted into Harvard’s chapter of academic honor society Phi Beta Kappa and played in a band called Bored of Education alongside future Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom B. Morello ’86.
“Both orgo and playing with Tom Morello, both were sort of the substance of my sophomore year,” she said. “Playing in that band was really just a highlight of my college years — and getting to play with someone as gifted as Tom was phenomenal.”
Bertozzi said that while the Nobel Prize recognized her work on bioorthogonal chemistry, her work has become more “clinical” in recent years.
“I'm trying to get some of these technologies translated into human medicines, and I have a couple of molecules in two of my companies that are in clinical trials now,” she said.
Within 10 minutes of the Nobel Committee’s announcement Wednesday morning, a Stanford press group was at Bertozzi’s door, she said. Bertozzi spent the rest of the day celebrating and meeting with press and university leaders.
“'I'm losing my voice, I'm exhausted, sleep deprived. And I'm overjoyed,” Bertozzi said.
