After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CORRECTION APPENDED
Public perception that Harvard serves as the home for scions of America’s landed aristocracy is almost as old as the University itself. In recent years, Harvard has very publicly tried to combat this idea, pumping millions of dollars into financial aid initiatives, retailoring admissions policies, and embracing in general a more meritocratic ethos. Nevertheless, The Chronicle of Higher Education recently published a report suggesting that these efforts have done little to change student demographics. The New York Times Economix blog reposted the article, with a headline that could not be more damning: “How Elite Colleges Still Aren’t Diverse.”
The cacophony of condemnation had begun.
However, the lynchpin of The Chronicle’s argument, that Harvard has a woefully small percentage of Pell Grant recipients—a noted metric of economic diversity—is dangerously misleading. According to Jeff Neal, spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, The Chronicle’s report includes Harvard Extension  School students, “nontraditional students," over ninety percent of whom neither seek nor qualify for Pell Grants. Also, Neal points out, The Chronicle’s survey includes international students, who are not eligible for Pell Grants regardless of financial circumstance. Thus, the actual percentages have increased from 12.8 percent in fiscal year 2008 to 14.02 percent in 2010—or, if we exclude international students, from 15 percent in 2008 to 16.8 percent in 2010. Yale’s Dean of Undergraduate Admissions, Jeffrey Brenzel, voiced similar concerns with Yale’s numbers, telling the Yale Daily News that “there are substantial problems with the Chronicle’s use of data, about which a number of schools in the study have complained.”
In light of these findings, we see The Chronicle’s report as shoddy research at best and invidious fact-fudging at worst. Observers should look beyond individual and inaccurate statistics when evaluating Harvard’s commitment to socioeconomic diversity, and instead holistically consider all of the administration’s efforts to create a more diverse and inclusive undergraduate body.
By the numbers, few schools do as much to empower the middle and working classes. Harvard has embarked on an ambitious financial aid initiative that has brought scholarship to portions of the population that only decades ago were nearly shut out of higher education. Harvard’s broad financial aid program, which strives to prevent students from graduating indebted, has combated the recent hyperinflation of college fees that has mired many young students in debt and forced others away from college completely.
For peddling this antiquated “rich-get-richer” narrative, soaked in sensationalist rhetoric, flawed statistics, and ignorance of current initiatives is not only journalistically irresponsible, The Chronicle owes its readers a retraction. By selling papers (or online subscriptions) and propagating the illusion that some shadowy, reactionary Harvard aristocracy is out to preserve the ruling class by excluding those less wealthy, The Chronicle creates a false image of Harvard and disrespects the laudable efforts of the Financial Aid Office. More importantly, however, the piece obfuscates genuine socioeconomic problems and diverts scrutiny away from the schools that are actually promoting social stratification, to the detriment of students everywhere. There are real and troubling socioeconomic barriers preventing students from accessing higher education, but the actual culprits are schools with large endowments that still couple notoriously high tuitions with notoriously small financial aid programs.
Undoubtedly, Harvard’s work is not complete. The fight to make college a socially inclusive institution is a constant struggle, but one worth continuing. Although Pell Grant percentages have been rising, elite institutions are still behind the national average. Harvard should neither abandon nor relax its initiatives aimed at promoting socioeconomic diversity.
That said, simply blaming a lack of diversity in elite universities on the schools themselves ignores the crux of what is truly a multifaceted problem. Although it is certainly true that systemic problems exist in the American education system so pervasive that no Harvard initiative, no matter how well intentioned or ardently promoted, can correct them alone. Substituting student loans with grant aid will not reduce gang violence, nor will it replace an absentee parent. Ultimately, lower-income students are handicapped at all levels of the educational system in ways too intangible for Harvard to equalize on its own.
We challenge those who believe that Harvard only promotes the status quo to visit our campus. What they will find are students freely pursuing whatever piques their interest, unburdened by the financial ramifications of their choices. Of course, Harvard may not yet be the purely meritocratic bastion of scholarship we all wish for, but by every measure, it is getting there.
CORRECTION: April 5, 2011
An  earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that The Chronicle of Higher Education's March 27 article, "Elite Colleges Fail to Gain More Students on Pell Grants," described the College has having a "small and declining" percentage of Pell Grant recipients. In fact, the article described the College only as having a small percentage, and noted that the share has increased since 2004-5.
CLARIFICATION: April 5, 2011
An earlier version of this article said that "The Chronicle’s report includes Harvard Extension  School students, “nontraditional students," who neither seek nor qualify for Pell Grants." It has been revised to say, "The Chronicle’s report includes Harvard Extension  School students, “nontraditional students," over ninety percent of whom neither seek nor qualify for Pell Grants."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students are not supposed to need advice. The student body is composed of high school overachievers who, ultra-competent and highly organized, were perhaps even attracted by the University’s “hands-off” advising approach when applying. But despite our competent beginnings, many students at some point falter in their navigation of Harvard’s overwhelming academic options and social demands. On these occasions, the support on offer is paltry. In response to student dissatisfaction, the advising structure is regularly reviewed and reformed. However, perhaps the real concern is not the advising system, but the tutor selection process itself.
After all, on paper, the University’s advising system seems to provide a strong source of support and guidance. The myriad structure of advisors includes resident tutors, sophomore advisors, and concentration advisors, while the Office of Admissions promises on its website many “festive receptions offering a congenial setting for informal contact between student and faculty” in residential advising. The reality, however, does not measure up to this theoretical depiction.
Despite the assured support, I have no idea who my concentration advisor is and don’t believe I ever met my sophomore advisor. Furthermore, although many of the house tutors are wonderful, I’ve also had several disappointing experiences—such as one tutor who patently refused to acknowledge my presence with even a smile, or another house tutor who lied to avoid giving me advice, or the government concentration advisor who didn’t know that Hist A-12 (one of the four major government introductory courses) counts as a government course. I could go on.
For students to receive proper support, academic advisors should have considerable knowledge of Harvard’s curriculum and residential tutors should have the time to guide students in a particular field, be it fellowships or public service. Moreover, tutors should be able to advise on personal worries at least at a basic level, although UHS should be the primary resource for mental health concerns. Ideally, there should be at least one tutor per house with significant mental health experience and, in an environment as fraught as Harvard’s, all advisors should have primary mental health awareness training to be able to spot those students with serious anxieties. A fortnightly study break simply doesn’t cut it.
The onus is on those individual tutors who cannot offer what their job title suggests, and as such, the University should reform its selection process to admit better-prepared tutors. Residential tutors should be selected solely on their ability to help students, and the pool should not be limited only to graduate students. Indeed, the current high proportion of Harvard graduates serving as in-house advisors means that many tutors do not have time to fulfil their role. As the selection process for tutors is incredibly competitive, the administration should be able to find tutors with a sincere interest in the job itself, not simply the free housing.
Yet the simplest and most effective means to improve Harvard’s advising system would be to allow students to evaluate their advisors. Just as freshmen respond to an online questionnaire about their proctors and the just as the Cue guide assesses professors, so should students be able to give considerable feedback about those whose primary job it is to “advise” them. If these student evaluations are taken into account when considering whether advisors will retain their posts, then the quality of advising at Harvard will undoubtedly improve.
The potential benefits of sincere and devoted advisors should not be underestimated. Well-informed concentration advisors significantly affect an educational experience, while house tutors who are genuinely concerned about student welfare considerably heighten the sense of community and individual student well-being. At this top-ranking university, student dissatisfaction is the one area where we rank consistently low, and these simple steps to improve the undergraduate experience should be taken without delay.
Until then, I suppose I’ll keep searching for those “festive receptions.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On economic issues, I consider myself to be an adherent of the neoliberal consensus that arose with the market-oriented “New Democrats” of the 1990s, persisted with George W. Bush’s “Compassionate Conservatism” in the 2000s, and survives to this day with Barack H. Obama’s Wall Street-coddling Keynesianism. I hate social welfare, but I love government distortion of free markets in the name of progress. On fiscal issues, I consider myself an unflinching budget hawk—except, of course, in times of war, economic hardship, or whenever the wealthy deserve a tax break. On social issues, I am a fervent civil libertarian, with the important exception of privacy rights and the growth of the surveillance state—privacy, in my mind, is overrated. On foreign policy issues, my views are an extremely complicated potpourri of Richard M. Nixon’s hawkish realism, Bush’s hawkish idealism, and Obama’s dovish realism. I can’t say that I care much for James E. Carter’s dovish idealism.
If you are bored by now, I can’t say that I blame you. If someone had just uttered the previous paragraph to me in the course of verbal conversation, I would have tuned out about halfway into the first sentence. Few things are as irksome as having a conversation with someone who is a little too eager to explain to you their political beliefs. Worse still is when they feel compelled to use more than three or four words to describe them (in my experience, this very special caliber of human being is most often found lurking around the Institute of Politics). But really, you can’t throw a copy of Paul Krugman’s “The Conscience of a Liberal” without hitting a Harvard student with a rehearsed political manifesto. Someone ought to tell these people that when somebody asks them about their political orientation, it is intended to be a polite conversational catalyst, not a genuine expression of interest in the frivolous worldview of some overeager Harvard sophomore destined for a desk job at the Department of the Interior.
No one actually cares whether you consider yourself to be a Rockefeller Republican or a Reagan Democrat, or whether you are an Obamacan or a McCainocrat. We don’t care that you hate latte liberals and country club conservatives—or was it Dunkin’ Donut Democrats and Sam’s Club Republicans? We don’t want to know if, by Jacksonian, you are referring to Andrew or Scoop, or whether you align more closely with the Jeffersonians or the Hamiltonians. We are not the slightest bit interested in whether or not you are an idealist or a realist, a populist or a pragmatist, a centrist or a purist, a moderate or a radical, a hawk or a dove, pro-life or pro-choice (or anti-life and pro-death). We don’t want to know if you are a small c conservative or a big L Liberal or vice versa, and we definitely don’t want to know if you are a neoconservative or a paleoliberal or vice versa. We don’t care if your ideological lodestar is Oakeshott or Keynes, Hayek or Rawls, and we reserve a special degree of disinterest for those for whom it’s Rand.
It requires a truly astonishing degree of presumptuousness for someone to believe that their particular insights on the appropriate balance between the cause of social justice and the prudence of free market economics ought to be, let alone is, of interest to anyone other than themselves. What unique experience or knowledge can any of us actually bring to bear to lend us the authority or credibility to proffer our views alongside those of Oakeshott, Keynes, Hayek, Rawls, and, yes, even Rand? For that is, in a nutshell, what one does when they detail in length their prescriptions for society’s ills.
Ideally, the explication of your ideological leanings shouldn’t exceed the amount of time it takes to say, “I don’t care.” Because when it comes to your political beliefs, none of us do. You are not important, and neither are your ideas. It would do actually to accomplish something (or run for something) first before you come and tell us that what you think about education, energy, and economics. But a good general rule of thumb is this: If the word count of your manifesto exceeds the word count of “The Communist Manifesto,” then yours is too long.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nintendo’s handheld game console, the 3DS, launched in North America this week. Though not the first example of a glasses-free 3D device, it is certainly the most widespread, and its success is yet another sign that 3D technology is here to stay. However, though the device is an impressive piece of engineering and is certainly a fun novelty, 3D technology remains a costly gimmick that doesn’t live up to the hype or justify its expense.
To first speak briefly in its defense, many of the classic arguments against 3D have been addressed since the technique began to see a revival near the end of the end of the last decade. The film Avatar showed that a successful 3D feature film doesn’t have to thrust pointy objects at the audience’s faces every few minutes, and the 3DS shows that glasses are hardly necessary, at least for devices.
However, the more serious knocks against 3D are inherent in the technology. A major class of issues with 3D is that our mammalian brains are not well-suited to the illusion created by 3D devices. For one thing, the 3D technology forces us to tilt our eyes straight ahead to look at a screen 80 or so feet in front of us, but 3D filmmakers sometimes put objects right in front of our faces, requiring us to tighten our focus. Since we normally also narrow our eyes when we focus on something so close up, this induced discrepancy between tilt and focus may account for the headaches people feel while watching 3D.
Since focusing takes time, 3D also limits the choices film editors can make. Rapid transitions between shots at different distances would be disorienting because they leave no time for the audience to change their focus.
There is also the issue of brightness. 3D works by sending a different image to each eye, and glasses only allow one of the two images to enter each lens. This blocking property causes images to appear darker because each eye is receiving less light that it does normally. Individual filmmakers can compensate somewhat by increasing the brightness, but correctly addressing the problem means we need twice the light, and doubling the power to projectors would burn out bulbs or generate too much heat. Many IMAX theaters compensate by using two projectors, but doing so is much more expensive and still doesn’t match recommended luminance standards. Projectors that use laser technology to crank up the brightness are theoretically possible but remain years away from production.
However, even if the technical problems were miraculously solved, it’s hardly worth it, because our brains just don’t care about depth very much. While we live in a 3D world, our visual systems are far more sensitive to information in the up-down and sideways dimensions. Researchers sometimes refer to our visual space as having 2.5 dimensions, rather than 3, because so much more processing power in the brain is devoted to analyzing flat images. A big reason we don’t care so much about stereoscopic depth is that many of the depth cues our brains use are encoded in flat images as well, such as shadows, size, and shading.
Because of this, flat images are more than adequate for providing an immersive experience in movies or video games. For instance, when we see a rocket ship that starts full-size and then shrinks down to a speck among the stars, we believe that it is hurtling off to hyperspace. We don’t need the third dimension to help us understand that it is moving away from us.
The technology has its fans and detractors, but up until now people have had a choice between 3D and 2D. Nintendo’s 3DS, for instance, comes with a slider that allows users to reduce the extent of the 3D effect down to zero. However, we are on the verge of crossing the threshold where the minority of 2D stalwarts may no longer have the option. Even with the slump in 3D sales at the start of this year, theater operators prefer 3D movies because they can charge a ticket premium, and we are not far away from all animated or action movies being released in 3D.  The next generation of home entertainment consoles and TVs will certainly be 3D equipped. These concerns are more than idle fears about new technology: Movies certainly didn’t make books obsolete, nor did video game consoles supersede television, but the current trajectory of 3D might mean that someday 2D displays will be a thing of the past.
As concerned citizens, we should opt to see our movies in 2D whenever possible and only purchase 3D devices if turning the 3D display off remains an option. Such determination might seem overblown, but it is worth defending the art forms we cherish before they are changed forever.

A group of academics, advocates, and government employees discussed the crossroads of race and disability, addressing the problems of civil rights, economic opportunity, and housing, at a panel discussion at Harvard Law School yesterday.
In a crowded room, the panelists examined the unique issues facing those who are both of color and disabled.
"Disability by itself and race by itself receive a lot of attention ... the intersection does not get what it deserves," said Executive Director of the Harvard Law School Project on Disability Michael A. Stein, who was moderating the event.
The panel opened with President of the Self-Advocacy Association of New York State, Chester Finn, who spoke about his experiences as a blind African-American man.
"Being a person with a disability, I had so many things to deal with that a lot of times I forgot what color I was," Finn said. "I was busy advocating for disability issues."
Although, as a blind man, Finn cannot discern the race of those around him, he said that he understands how "race makes a difference" on a daily basis.
This issue of division—needing to choose between identifying with a specific race or as disabled—arose several times during the discussion.
Fair Housing Manager for the Metropolitan Boston Housing Partnership Barbara Chandler said that when she receives housing requests from colored disabled patrons, she must categorize the petition as either a disability complaint or a race one.
Chandler said that disabled people and people of color usually receive poor housing by identifying with one of these groups and those who are both disabled and of color often receive sub-par housing.
Beyond the implications in the housing market, Chandler said she considers this divisive approach to be morally reprehensible, as she believes people should not be forced to give one part of their identity primacy for the sake of getting better housing.
Richard M. Glassman of Boston’s Disability Law Center addressed some of the ways that new technology is helping lawyers advocate for people who are disabled and of color. Glassman said that his group uses new mapping technology, called GIS, to identify communities that have a large number of people who are of color and disabled in order to do grassroots organizing.
Attendees of the event said they enjoyed the discussion.
"I thought it was very informative," said Betsy Pillsbury, who is the disability research coordinator for Partners HealthCare. "It’s something that isn’t talked about very much and it should be."

Former Governor of New Mexico Bill Richardson said yesterday that he supported President Obama’s decision to join the NATO coalition conducting airstrikes in support of rebels in Libya, though he hedged his remarks by saying that he was against putting American soldiers on the ground.
Richardson said that if the NATO forces had not intervened, the situation in Libya would have turned into a "massive humanitarian disaster." Despite this necessity, he said that it is critical that the U.S. works within the framework of the mission sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council because American military forces are already overextended in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"If there is a debate within the administration on providing training or airlifting weapons to the rebels, or possibly some small arms through a small country or covert action in assisting the rebels, as long as it’s not boots on the ground, as long as its part of a NATO effort ... I would say yes," Richardson said.
Richardson predicted that the conflict would ultimately end when Gaddafi’s military forces him to step down from power and go into exile.
Richardson has significant experience with dictatorial regimes after having conducted negotiations with some of the world’s most famous strongmen, including Saddam Hussein, Kim Jung-Il, and Slobodan Milosevic.
After leaving his post as the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. in 1998, Richardson has proven adept at negotiating with regimes unfriendly to the U.S., leading President Clinton to remark that "bad people like [Richardson]."
"I try to connect with the bad person—the dictator—to find ways for common ground, what makes this person tick," Richardson said.
During the Clinton administration, Richardson also served as Secretary of Energy, and last night he weighed in on the current alarm surrounding nuclear energy after the nuclear disaster in Japan. He said that given the fact that the U.S. currently gets 20 percent of its power from nuclear power sources, the U.S. should consider increased safety regulations at the 104 plants currently operating in 31 states.
"I’m not for a moratorium on nuclear—I’m for a time out," Richardson said. "We need to join together in a bipartisan way. This is not politics. This is what’s good for the country."
Ultimately, Richardson said that the U.S. needs to invest in clean sources of energy like solar and wind rather than relying on the sources used currently.
Students at the event said that they appreciated hearing Richardson’s opinion on current events given his wealth of experience.
"He had so many different perspectives, so he really gave credibility to his opinions," said Arturo Elizondo ’14.
Richardson’s remarks were given as the 2011 Corliss Lamont Lecture, which is given to an individual whose actions have diminished the likelihood of nuclear war.

Poll results released yesterday by the Institute of Politics revealed that President Obama’s approval rating among young adults now stands at 55 percent, after over a year of falling approval ratings.
The results are part of a national poll of people aged 18 to 29 that the IOP conducts twice a year.
The survey, entitled "Survey of Young Americans’ Attitudes Towards Politics and Public Service," included 3,018 Americans and explored a wide range of issues including degree of political engagement, trust in government institutions, political ideology, and engagement with social media.
Rising support for President Obama did not mean, however, that young Americans were increasingly optimistic about the state of the country or the future.
The economy is a particular area of concern, as 43 percent of those surveyed described their own financial situation as "very bad" or "fairly bad." Additionally, 82 percent of young adults said it would be "difficult" to find a permanent job coming out of college.
Looking outside of their personal finances, young adults were pessimistic about the United States’ future position in the world. More respondents said that they thought the nation’s diplomatic and economic situation would worsen than those who said they were optimistic about the future.
John Della Volpe, director of polling for the IOP, said he attributed the difference between the President’s overall approval rating and overwhelming dissatisfaction on specific issues to the "trust relationship" he has developed with the American people.
"People are beginning to rate the President more favorably on the likeability factor than by looking at his issues on a case by case basis," Della Volpe said.
Despite their support for the President, survey participants demonstrated little trust in government institutions, with respondents saying they trusted Congress to do the right thing only 23 percent of the time.
C. M. Trey Grayson ’94, the director of the IOP, said that the survey’s data is particularly important because young voters are a significant demographic in the 2012 presidential election.
The poll provided insight into the ways young adults prefer to receive information and become involved with political candidates, which could be helpful in upcoming campaigns, Grayson said. Twenty-seven percent of respondents said that using social media like Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube to support a political cause was more efficient than in-person advocacy. Additionally, after traditional news sources, the next most popular way of receiving information about current events was through friends’ Facebook statuses, followed by the Facebook feeds of official organizations.
"What’s been proven in 2008 and in the events in the Middle East of late is that young adults can make the difference when inspired," said Della Volpe in a press release. "And before inspiration happens, it’s important to understand how Millennials communicate—providing this perspective is what we aim to do every semester with our national research project."

The management of the health care system is failing to direct resources efficiently, leading to higher mortality rates and lower revenue, panelists at the Harvard Business School said yesterday.
In a room filled to capacity with doctors, business owners, and students at the Spangler Auditorium, the three panelists explored the business of medicine.
David M. Cutler ’87, a professor at the College who specializes in health care economics, began the discussion by speaking about why a patient could get lost in the health care system.
"When polled, patients think the technical capacity of health care is superb. However, they believe the service quality is awful," Cutler said. "Demand for doctors exceeds supply, so quality can remain low."
Although the population in the United States has grown rapidly, the number of doctors has stayed relatively stagnant since the early ’80s.
Cutler added that waste and inefficiency also play a key role in people’s perception of poor service.
"The United States spends close to $1 trillion on health care that goes to failed interventions, essentially wasted," Cutler said.
Atul Gawande, bestselling author and an associate professor at the Medical School, highlighted advances made due to his hallmark "checklist" system, which recommends implementing simple detailed checklists in order to improve outcomes.
He highlighted the three main steps of his program, which has been adopted by the health care system of the Department of Veterans Affairs.
"The three steps are the ability to recognize failure, devise solutions that can be deployed to fix these failures, and create a portfolio that reduces costs," Gawande said. "Using these steps, the VA system was able to reduce mortality by 18 percent."
Gawande also advocated improving the analysis of health care service data. He explained, for instance, that trying to calculate how many CT scans are performed within a given state is almost impossible because information is so scattered and non-standardized.
Closing out the discussion, Raffaella Sadun, an assistant professor at the Business School, revealed results from a recent study that analyzed the correlation between management performance and the quality of health care in a total of 19 countries.
Using MBA students to interview hospital executives, the results revealed a very strong relationship between health care quality and management. Hospitals with higher scores had lower levels of mortality rates as well as higher profits.
The panel was sponsored by the Harvard Business School’s Healthcare Initiative.

Nancy M. Cline oversees Harvard College Library's 12 million volumes, but she maintains a more modest stock of antiquated collection catalogs and thick Chinese books from Yenching Library in her office.
Below the books on the shelf, Cline’s white hardhat, lettered with bold "HCL" on the front, projects out, a memento of the large-scale restoration of the Widener Library building that she led as head of Harvard College Library.
The physical renovation of Widener was part of Cline’s larger vision to modernize HCL—the largest unit in the University library system—that included programs like a high-tech conservation initiative housed in Widener basement.
But after nearly 15 years, Cline will leave this summer as her position is folded into the newly centralized administrative structure of the University-wide system.
Colleagues say that Cline’s tenure has set the stage for the University’s ongoing overhaul of the largest private library system in the world.
"It’s been an important period in the history of the academic library in the world. The way people use libraries has changed radically in those years," says William P. Stoneman, head of Houghton Library, which houses Harvard’s primary collection of rare books. "The Harvard Library has kept up in large part because of Nancy Cline."
But at this time of major university-level library restructuring, Cline is headed out in June.
"It’s a bittersweet moment," Cline says.
FEAT OF LIBRARIANSHIP
The restoration of Widener Library—the iconic center of the University’s entire system—took five years, as millions of books cycled through the floors of the library and workers worked on specific flights.
"It was one of the great feats of librarianship," Director of the Harvard Library Robert C. Darnton ’60 says of Cline’s leadership through the renovation.
Darnton remembers when Samuel C. Butler ’51, a former president of the University Board of Overseers and one of the former chairs of the New York Public Library, took him aside as the professor was about to leave his post at Princeton to join Harvard.
"And he said, ‘Just do whatever Nancy Cline says you should do, and you’ll be all right,’" he says. "And that was great advice."
The renovation that began in 1999 restored the library to its original aesthetic. The building, as any Harvard tour guide will tell, went up in 1915 in memory of Henry E. Widener, Class of 1907, after he passed away on the Titanic.
While originally constructed with detailed molding and exquisite pallet choices, Cline says, the library in the 1950s became more industrial. Harvard installed low-hanging ceilings and halogen floodlights that hid the intricate designs that lined some of the library’s ceilings, such as those in her office, she says.
"In this office, there used to be an ugly stained, eggcrate-tiled ceiling, and one time we had to fix something electrical. So this facilities maintenance guy has this tall ladder and climbs on up and then shouts down to me, ‘Ma’am—do you have any idea what is up here?’" Cline says. "And I, of course, didn’t."
The renovations incorporated motion-sensitive lights, better ventilation, and two additional reading rooms and an elevator, while workers were also analyzing pictures of the original library to uphold the image of Henry Widener’s mother—the principal benefactor.
"We wanted it to be honest to the original memorial for her son," Cline says.
Library administrators recall how the pillars, once turned an ashen gray from students smoking in the building, gleamed white at the end of the cleaning.
"You could even argue that the work that she’s done in renovating the Harvard library, that those were the impetus of creating the wider Harvard Library," Stoneman says.
"It was one of the proudest things I could’ve done as head," Cline says.
PRESERVING FOR THE FUTURE
Below the old pillars of Widener, the basement of the library hums with ultra-modern facilities to preserve and conserve the University’s entire collection.
Staff members work to photograph pages of books—one by one—in controlled environments with some of the most advanced apparatuses, says Cline.
Members of the Harvard Library system say that Cline’s persistence to preserve Harvard’s collections came early in the global discussion on digitization that many consider instrumental to the library’s future.
"She was digitizing volumes way before some other people had even thought of it," Stoneman says.
Currently, the preservation labs have been working under the auspices of the Chinese government to digitize Yenching Library’s collection of scholarly antique works.
The labs are part of what Cline says is a "reprioritization in libraries everywhere."
"This is only one major way that Harvard will be the library of the 21st century," Cline says.
LIBRARY REFORM
Cline’s efforts fit into a larger reform process across the University’s entire library system.
With the creation of an overarching Harvard Library Board and the appointment of Helen Shenton as executive director, Harvard has taken the first steps towards realizing a long-term centralization process.
The decision, announced this past December, followed the Library Work Group’s publication of wide-reaching recommendations to improve efficiencies in a system facing rising costs and significant redundancies.
"What we intend is to create ... a single university library," Cline adds. "We’ll all work under a big umbrella."
In the past, according to Cline, administrators at Harvard’s different schools have separately dealt with collection strategies at their respective library units.
"We think we can do better by bringing in new alignments," Cline says.
Colleagues say that Cline has always focused on the wider library system.
Director of Development for the Harvard College Library Peggy D. Molander says that Cline ensured that people "understand that college libraries are not just Widener."
"[She is] a wonderful ambassador," Molander says.
Darnton says Cline was an active participant in the discussion to recast the unified Harvard Library.
"Nancy was a crucial voice in developing the ideas in the Work Group," Darton says. "She argued for the best interests of everyone."
Cline was also a principal orchestrator for the historic opening up of its collection to peer institutions, in line with the Work Group recommendations.
This January, Harvard announced that it would begin sharing its 17-million-volume collection with other Ivy League schools and MIT as part of the Borrow Direct program, nearly 10 years after the other schools started the program.
But when the program goes live for the Harvard community in summer 2011, Cline will be leaving her post.
"You never feel comfortable leaving something you’ve worked on for such a long time," Cline says. "But I’ll return as a user of the libraries."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
C. M. Trey Grayson ’94 is suffering from a serious case of déjà vu.
As the new director of the Harvard Institute of Politics, he lives in Kirkland House just like he did as a Harvard undergraduate 20 years ago.
He recently attended a study break thrown by his entryway’s tutor and shared snacks with Harvard undergraduates.
Occasionally, he even sees Bob, the security guard he used to meet in the hallways in 1993.
"Sometime, I’m like Rip Van Winkle and it’s exactly the same. But I don’t recognize anybody—all my friends are gone," Grayson says.
After graduating from Harvard, Grayson moved back to Kentucky, his home state, to study law. He eventually served as Kentucky’s Secretary of State and launched a bid for the U.S. Senate under the Republican banner last year. When he lost the race, Grayson decided to go back to his roots. He moved back to campus in January, this time as the new director of the Institute of Politics.
HARVARD BOUND
Grayson first visited Harvard as an eighth grader and promptly decided he wanted to apply.
Grayson was admitted to the class of 1994 under Harvard’s Early Action program. He was assigned to Weld Hall and later moved to Kirkland House with five of his closest friends.
"He was the glue that held us together," says Chris Wood ’94, who shared a suite with Grayson in Weld.
Wood says Grayson was a great moderator and often took the lead in his group of friends. His roommates turned to him whenever they needed to know "which roommate should get to date the cute girl we all [had] just met, and how late to stay at Wellesley parties before the last ‘Cuddle Shuttle’ left for Cambridge," according to Wood.
Grayson and his roommates also loved to play pranks, according to Philip M. Grant ’94, who lived with Grayson all four years of college. Grant recalls a particular winter break when he and Grayson moved all their neighbors’ furniture around while they were absent.
Yet, Grant says, Grayson was particularly self-conscious about getting caught.
"It was remarkable to me how he never wanted to get into trouble," Grant says. "We don’t have any incriminating evidence [against him]."LOFTY AMBITIONS
Grayson first told his future roommates about his passion for politics when he wrote them during the summer before their freshman year, according to Wood.
"He quickly announced his intention to become president," Wood says.
When Grayson later found out he was living in John F. Kennedy’s room in Weld, he put up a poster of the former U.S. president on his wall.
As an undergraduate, Grayson also cross-enrolled at the Harvard Kennedy School, where he took classes on financial regulations and health policy.
His interest for politics led him to attend his first forum at the IOP in 1990. The event—titled "Personal Perspectives in Politics"—raised his interest in the institute.
Grayson quickly got involved with the IOP and eventually became the Vice Chair of the Student Advisory Committee.
He says the IOP helped him develop the bipartisan approach to politics he became known for as a politician. He identified as a Democrat during his undergraduate years, yet his experience at the IOP exposed him to a wide range of political views.
"Almost everyone here has a [specific] point of view, but we [all] care about politics for its own sake," Grayson says.
THE ROAD TO THE STATE CAPITAL
Although Grayson had always had an interest in politics, the final impetus to begin his political career came over a burrito. He was working as an attorney at the time and had gotten involved in local politics while organizing an event during President George W. Bush’s 2000 presidential campaign. During the event, he became close with a group of local political organizers, who would be instrumental in his later political career. And it was a lunch invitation from one of these friends that began his career as an elected politician.
"One day I get this email. The subject is ‘Lunch at Joe’s?’ and the body of the email said ‘Topic: Grayson for [Secretary of State]. Time: 11:30’ and I replied ‘Time: good, Location: good, Topic: not so good," said Grayson. "But we went anyway and ... that was sort of where it was hatched."
Typically someone without political experience cannot decide to run for a state-wide office and win on their first try. But Grayson benefited from the Republican party’s unfortunate luck in the state of Kentucky. For decades before Grayson ran for office, Democrats had consistently won all of Kentucky’s constitutional offices, from Governor to Secretary of State. Because of the Democratic party’s near monopoly on state power at the time, few career Republicans wanted to dedicate their time running for office, leaving a void for a 31-year-old with no past political experience.
Grayson was sworn in as Secretary of State of Kentucky in 2003 and was the youngest Secretary of State in the nation at that time. During his time in the position, Grayson focused on moving many of the state’s services online.
Although Grayson says that he enjoyed his time in office, he acknowledged that the job is not necessarily as advertised.
"You have to put the work in. So many candidates run for office because they think of the glamour and the glitz and it’s not that. It’s really hard, but it’s really rewarding too," Grayson says.
FROM STUDENT TO DIRECTOR
Grayson says he first learned about the IOP Director position when he was running for Kentucky’s Senate seat, but he did not think that he would apply. But after losing the primary in the race for Senate, Grayson reconsidered his decision.
Grayson’s appointment was announced in January and he started when students returned to campus for spring semester.
Going into his first days at the IOP, Grayson was far from a stranger, which helped him immediately jump into his daily activities.
"I felt more comfortable on day one at the IOP than I did on day one as Secretary of State," Grayson says.
IOP President Jeffrey F. Solnet ’12, who has worked closely with Grayson since he assumed the post, says that Grayson’s past experience as a student involved at the IOP allowed him to "hit the ground running."YOUNG FOR THE ROLE
Not content with having been the youngest Secretary of State in the country, at age 38, Grayson is one of the youngest Directors in the IOP’s history. However, students overwhelmingly say that they are not concerned about Grayson not being experienced enough to hold the position.
"His experience as undergrad is pretty recent so he’ll be able to connect to students," says Michael W. McLean ’12, president of the Harvard Republican Club. "Youth is only a positive."
Solnet says that Grayson’s breadth of political experience at such a young age provides an inspiring example for students involved at the IOP.
"The IOP is about encouraging young people to go into public service and politics," Solnet says. "Because [Grayson] is a younger person who has done so much, there is no better person to represent the organization than that."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Only beer and wine—not hard alcohol—will be served at off-campus formals this semester, according to changes in the alcohol policy outlined by Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson at a Committee on Student Life meeting yesterday morning.
In addition, House staff and members of Student Event Services teams—the new form of the Beverage Authorization Teams that previously distributed alcohol to students—will now be required to check student IDs at all large House events. While the new policy stipulates that larger House events like dining hall parties must have a SES team or House staff, it remains unclear if this policy will apply to smaller events such as Stein Clubs.
These modifications represent part of a larger push by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds to enforce alcohol policy in a more uniform manner throughout the Houses, Nelson said.
Last year the College banned hard alcohol from on-campus formals after the Cambridge License Commission decided that only beer and wine licenses could be issued for ticketed events taking place in dining halls.
The decision to extend the policy to off-campus House events comes in the wake of two weeks of rumors regarding possible changes to the College alcohol policy since the cancellation of "Pfoho Golf," which was to take place last weekend.
At the time, Pforzheimer House Masters Nicholas A. Christakis and Erika L. Christakis ’86 sent an email to the House community informing them that the event did not abide by College policy because it involved the distribution of hard alcohol and did not have House or SES staff serving liquor.
Last month, Hammonds published an editorial in The Crimson about the College’s alcohol policy and the dangers of binge drinking.
"The College’s alcohol policy is designed to safeguard the health of students and to create an environment that gives undergraduates the best chance to learn and grow at Harvard," Hammonds wrote.
In the midst of current attempts to standardize alcohol policy across the Houses, House Committee chairs have said that the way each House interprets the alcohol policy seems to be in flux. For example, Kirkland House HoCo chair Juan P. Munoz ’12 said that the Office of Student Life indicated to him that Kirkland would be permitted to serve hard alcohol at its off-campus spring formal at the Boston Aquarium on April 30. 
Munoz said that he received an email this morning indicating that there would be changes in the alcohol policy at this month’s formal.
"It’s a big surprise," he said.
HoCo chairs said that the decision to require more oversight of alcohol distribution at House events is likely to have a larger impact on House life than the decision to ban hard alcohol from House off-campus events.
HoCo chairs have said that policy at House events like Stein Clubs that regularly allow HoCos to serve their peers may have to change because of the new policy.
During the meeting, Nelson said that the CSL would form a committee of House Masters, students, and other members of the College community to further review the alcohol policy.
She said that the policy may change further once the committee finishes its evaluation.

Grendel’s Den, a Harvard Square mainstay, celebrates its 40th birthday today.
Founded by Sue and Herbert Kuelzer in 1971, the restaurant has withstood an upstairs expansion, a Supreme Court battle over Massachusetts’ liquor license policy, and was originally home to Harvard’s Pi Eta Club, a now defunct final club.
When Grendel’s originally opened, it was barred from selling liquor by a Massachusetts law stating that a church or school had the ability to block any liquor license of an establishment within 500 feet.
Harvard Law School Professor Laurence H. Tribe ’62 represented Grendel’s in the case. The Supreme Court voted 8-1 in favor of Grendel’s, ruling that the law violated the First Amendment establishment clause. The case changed existing laws in nine states.
Recently featured in Ben Affleck’s 2010 film The Town, Grendel’s serves casual gourmet food like the Spinach Pie and Greek Salad, which have both been on the menu since its opening.
Grendel’s bartender Emil Kabawat said that a group of loyal customers gives the restaurant a special atmosphere, comparing it to the bar in the television show Cheers, where the bartender knows each regular customer and their drink.
"The students really make the place pop on weekends," he said. "Every Friday night, I see the same 30 or so kids, and everyone has a great time. There’s just no other place that looks like this."
Kari Kuelzer, current Grendel’s owner and daughter of the founders, said that when one-time members of the former Pi Eta club return to the space they say it reminds them of their old club.
"It was still the same vibe somehow as the fun times they used to have here," Kuelzer said.
To celebrate their 40th year, Grendel’s will have food, live music, Grendel’s trivia, raffle prizes, specialty cake, and a photo booth where guests can pose in a Grendel’s costume.
"The cake will show the back wall of the restaurant and the table in the back where the staff hangs out, and it’ll be held up by a frosting version of Grendel," said Nick Ghilardi, Grendel’s employee and professional cake decorator.
The event will begin at 9 p.m. and from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m. new arrivals will be admitted as space permits with no charge.
Proceeds will benefit CitySprouts, a non-profit organization that provides sustainable schoolyard gardens and educational programs for Cambridge public schools.

 At an emotional vigil last night, speakers, some of whom were undocumented immigrants, said that such individuals live in a state of fear and that newcomers to this country—whether undocumented or not—continue to face cultural obstacles upon arrival.
When entering Braun Room of Andover Hall at the Harvard Divinity School, attendees were greeted by flickers of light from the more than 100 candles placed around the windows and tables that dimly illuminated the room.
Mats and pillows were set on the floor along with an altar in the center of the room, on top of which were placed items recovered from a student’s trip to the desert near the U.S.-Mexico border, including a hat and backpack.
"We wanted to create a community which would allow us to discuss these issues in depth," Kye S. Flannery, one of the organizers, said.
During the vigil, a number of people participated in sharing their testimonials, poetry, and other spoken word.
"I’m undocumented, I’m unafraid, and we’re going to do something about it," said one of the speakers. He was one of three speakers that mentioned that they were in the U.S. without legal documentation currently or at some point in the past.
One of the performers, Daily Guerrero ’14, said that "despite pledging allegiance, they face the fear of deportation," in reference to illegal immigrants in the U.S.
Another participant, a woman who immigrated from Iraq a year ago and is currently a volunteer at the Boston Children’s Hospital, said that "the biggest challenge for me today is the cultural barrier" and that in Iraq, her family faced "the risk of being killed by a roadside bomb."
The vigil, organized by the Divinity School’s Borderlinks group, centered around the issue of immigration and the difficulties that follow the introduction into a new culture that in many cases can be hostile to newly arrived immigrants.
Around half of the vigil attendees were students from the Divinity School and surrounding universities. Earlier this year, the students from the Divinity School took a trip over winter break to Nogales and Tuscon, Ariz. near the U.S.-Mexico frontier to hear first-hand the experiences of people who worked at the border and individuals who have made the journey into the U.S.
"During the trip, we had to put everything else aside and reflect on the current situation of these immigrants," said Katherine F. Hagan, one of the Divinity School students that went on the trip.
Organizers said that they chose to hold last night’s vigil out of a desire "to bring these stories and experiences to the Greater Boston area."
Following the main vigil service in the Braun Room, guests at the vigil were asked to carry candles to the chapel on the floor above where they all sang and placed the candles in the center of the room after a moment of quiet reflection.

Because of what they say is a lack of awareness for autism within the Harvard community, a group called Harvard Undergraduates Raising Autism Awareness is launching a campaign this month to bring increased attention to the condition.
HURAA is supported by Harvard Medical School Professor Martha R. Herbert and was founded by three undergraduates: Ariana C. Cernius ’13, Samuel Q. Singer ’13, and Ian G. Roy ’14. They chose to come together to raise awareness of autism because of shared experiences with close family members who have autism spectrum disorders. Currently there is no campus student organization focused on autism.
Cernius has been involved in raising awareness for the condition since high school. She has first-hand experiences dealing with the disorder as her younger brother Andrew was diagnosed with autism at the age of 16 months.
"I always felt the need to stick up for and protect my brother from people who judged him out of ignorance, or treated him differently," she said.
Upon coming to Harvard she aimed to continue raising awareness, but after finding no existing forum to do so, she and a few like-minded individuals decided to start their own.
HURAA aims to counter the stereotypes surrounding autism in popular culture.
April is Autism Awareness Month, and HURAA has launched what they call the light it up yellow campaign. For every $1 pledged by students, HURAA will put up a yellow puzzle piece poster on campus. There will also be bracelets and candy with autism facts available.
Proceeds will go to autism related charities and future autism guest speakers. HURAA plans to begin fundraising outside the Science Center and Annenberg in coming weeks.
Cernius said that movies have perpetuated the idea that autism is associated with savant-like qualities, such as the incredible card counting abilities of Sean Penn’s character in the movie "Rain Man."
Autism is a spectrum disorder, which means that its symptoms can include varying degrees of impaired social interaction and repetitive behavior. Sean Penn’s character represents an exaggerated version of someone afflicted with Asperger’s syndrome, a highly functional subset of the autism spectrum.
The wide range of the autism spectrum can cause confusion for people not familiar with the disease. Most cases of autism fall into the other end of the spectrum and exhibit symptoms some people may confuse with those of mental retardation, a point that often frustrates the loved ones of people dealing with autism.
"When they immediately classify my brother as ‘that retard,’ my blood boils. There are very few things that make me angry, and that is one of them," Singer said.

In a bid to alleviate what they see as a stressful start to the collegiate experience, administrators are strongly encouraging student organizations to postpone application and "comp" deadlines until after the study card day for freshmen.
Postponing the deadlines until after study card day—which, on the Registar’s Office calendar, falls on Sept. 7 during the next academic year—will "ensure that first-year students have the space in which to prepare for the year academically, socially, and personally," according to an email Assistant Dean for Student Life David R. Friedrich said he and Director for Freshman Programming Katie W. Steele sent to student leaders.
This past year, some student organizations required that students submit applications to be a part of their group. But administrators say that is difficult to find a balance between completing applications and focusing on academics.
"Students’ primary reason for being at Harvard is their academic work, and that should not be overshadowed by spending too much time on extracurricular activities," Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson said in a statement. "Balance is important."
In addition, the student activities fair will be held on Sept. 2—two days after the start of classes.
This academic year, the fair was on the first day of classes, which administrators felt was overwhelming for students—especially for first-year students who had not yet acclimated to Harvard academics.
"People were getting all wound up about extracurricular decisions when they should have been focused on their classes," said Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67.
Administrators have long expressed concerns that the workload associated with extracurricular activities detracts from students’ academic experience.
"It’s very intense. It’s very competitive," Nelson had said in October about the Opening Days schedule. "When you’re new to a campus, that can feel very overwhelming."
Olivia A. Abbate ’14 called the shift in the calendar "a productive move."
"Things get crazy with new classes and extracurriculars," she said.
But Kristin I. Barclay ’14 said that she thought the change would have little impact.
"It’s still the same amount of stuff to do in the first week," she said.

With the Major League Baseball season officially starting today, and Harvard’s own baseball team toiling at 3-16, it’s a fair question to ask what—if any—relationship the Crimson and the big leagues have had over the years.
In February, we discussed Frank Hermann ’06 and his foray into the majors, pitching for the Cleveland Indians.
Hermann is the first Harvard baseball player to reach the majors since Jeff Musselman ’85 suited up for the Blue Jays and Mets between 1985 and 1990. But before Musselman, the Crimson had a pretty extensive history of major leaguers.
It all began with Jim Tyng ’76—that’s 1876—who played three games for the Boston Red Caps in 1879, and then returned to play one game for his hometown Philadelphia Phillies in 1888. Needless to say, he was not one of Harvard’s more prolific or successful athletes.
During the deadball era (everything before 1919), the Crimson was a veritable feeder program for the majors, sending six ballplayers to the big leagues. In the 92 years since, Harvard has only managed ten more.
But these were not the glory days of Crimson baseball. Between 1968 and 1974, Harvard went to the College World Series four times, sending two members of those teams to the bigs: pitcher Ray Peters ’68 and catcher Pete Varney ’71.
Peters only played one year, for the Milwaukee Brewers, and ended his career 0-2. Varney lasted five years, playing 69 games for the Chicago White Sox and Atlanta Braves.
The longest tenured Harvard graduate to play in the majors was third baseman Eddie Grant ’05, who was known to fans as “Harvard Eddie.” Grant spent 10 years in the big leagues and batted .249 for the Phillies, Cincinnati Reds and New York Giants. In 1915, Grant retired and joined the Army. He died three years later in the Battle of Meuse-Argonne, France while fighting in World War 1.
With a history of MLB participation and Hermann in the Indians bullpen, perhaps Harvard’s next major leaguer is on the current Crimson roster.

The Harvard men’s heavyweight crew team is the last, but certainly not the least, of the Crimson crews to begin competition this spring. Harvard hopes to start the season off right, as the team faces off against fellow Ancient Eight competitor Cornell. Last year, the two schools renewed their rivalry, competing in a dual race for the first time since 1946.
Although Harvard came out on top last spring, the squads are well matched. The schools’ first varsity eights were selected as 2009-10 Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges Co-Crews of the Year, and the two crews battled for dominance on the water throughout the 2009-10 and the fall seasons.
Last year, Harvard beat the Big Red during the dual season and at Eastern Sprints. The Crimson picked up the Compton Cup, the Adams Cup, the Smith Cup, the Rowe Cup, and a win at the Harvard-Yale Regatta along the way to a 7-1 dual record.
At EARC Sprints, Harvard clinched a 2.5 second victory in the Grand Final, earning the program its 26th Eastern Sprints and 26th Ivy League title.
But Cornell had its way at the Intercollegiate Rowing Association National Championships.
“We ended up beating them in our dual last year and then at sprints,” junior six-seat Nick Jordan said. “But then at IRAs they had a pretty good race in that final and had maybe a little bit favorable lane draw with the winds. They ended up just knitting us at the end which was definitely frustrating for a lot of the guys. So in this race, we’re looking to really have a little payback and to try to make a statement.”
While the Big Red didn’t make the sprints grand final, it managed to beat the Crimson by less than a second at the IRA National Championships. The Crimson finished in fourth place, but the Cornell boat prevented it from medaling.
The Harvard squad recovered in the 2010-2011 fall season. In its first showing at the Head of the Charles, the Crimson came in second, finishing less than two seconds behind Washington. Cornell finished a little over 15 seconds behind to earn the sixth place spot.
While the Crimson handily defeated Cornell in the fall season, the Big Red consistently puts together an impressive boat.
“We beat them at Head of the Charles, but it’s very different race,” Jordan said. “It’s a headrace rather than a side-by-side 2k. And that was a long time ago. So I don’t think we have any expectations or assumptions going into this race. We just have to assume that they’re just as fast as we are, then make our minds up to outrace them.”
Recent Crimson success may have something to do with high membership retention. One rower, captain Blake Pucsek, graduated last spring, and one is injured, but six rowers will be returning. Two sophomores fill the gaps in the boat: three-seat Parker Washburn and bowman James O’Connor.
“Both of them are pretty outstanding rowers and great guys,” junior five-seat Mike DiSanto explained. “They will definitely make a huge positive impact on the boat. You don’t have to worry about either one of the during a race. You just know that they’re going to be giving 110 percent every stroke and pulling as hard as they can all the way down the course.”
These two additions are no strangers to success. Last year, their freshman boat posted an undefeated dual season.
After months of preparation and practice, the Crimson is ready to face some competition. Harvard broke up extensive time on the erg with side-by-side races and sun during a spring break trip in Florida, where the team practiced twice each day. After the break the Crimson returned indoors until March recess when it finally got back on the Charles.
“It’s been a very strong preseason, if you will, leading up to this race,” DiSanto said. “I think it’s probably the strongest team I’ve ever been on.”
In the battle of the burgundies, Harvard will face the Big Red on Saturday morning. As a grudge match and home-opener, this race is sure to make a splash.
“To say that guys are excited for this race is an understatement,” DiSanto said. “I don’t know what’s going to happen on Saturday—[I] can’t predict that—but Cornell’s definitely a very, very fast team and definitely a team to be respected. They’re definitely a worthy crew. It’ll be a great race. We’re going to have to come guns blazing for them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Throughout their time on the gridiron as members of Harvard’s football team, Collin Zych, Gino Gordon, Marco Iannuzzi, Chuks Obi, and Brent Osborne kept their opponents guessing. Now they’re the ones playing a waiting game.
The five athletes recently participated in two NFL Pro Days in hopes of making an NFL team. The league has the next move.
Each participated in a Pro Day on March 23 at Boston College, and four athletes participated in a second one Wednesday at Palmer Dixon and in the Stadium.
“I think it went really well,” Iannuzzi said. “As a group, we really performed well. A few of us had personal bests. We sort of got a little more exposure, definitely got some more eyes on us.”
Originally, the team had planned to participate solely in the Pro Day at BC, but James Frazier, the head of the Crimson’s strength and conditioning program, scheduled one on campus a few weeks ago, according to Osborne.
“They’re going to have every single NFL team in there,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said on Tuesday, March 8. “To have access to every single NFL team…makes perfect sense. It’s nice of BC to let us be part of that and recognize that we have some great talent.”
And the more Pro Days the better for the Crimson’s athletes, who recognize that spots in the NFL will be hard to come by.
“All of them have the potential to play in the NFL, but they all realize that they’re going to have to test well,” Murphy said before the combines.
Of all of the athletes, Iannuzzi might be the one with the best shot at earning a professional contract because he has also been pursuing a career in the CFL. The wide receiver participated in the CFL Combine over the weekend between March 4 and 6.
“For him, it’s natural,” Murphy said of Iannuzzi’s chances in the CFL. “They’re dying for outstanding athletes like that.”
Iannuzzi hasn’t announced which league he would prefer.
Meanwhile, the other four are competing for a spot in a league that may or may not have a season this coming fall.
“I consider myself a guy on the bubble,” Osborne said. “From what I understand, if a lockout is still going on, it would be hard to sign as a free agent.”
Should NFL teams take the field, there is no reason to believe that one of these five wouldn’t be among the ranks. One likely to do so is Zych, captain of the 2010 team. Zych and rising senior Josué Ortiz were the only athletes in the conference to be unanimously named first-team All Ivy.
“He’s a safety with corner speed [and] tremendous instincts, a big play kid,” Murphy said. “I don’t think he would have any problem getting a good look in an NFL camp.”
Senior Gino Gordon, co-recipient of the 2010 Ivy League Player of the Year award, is arguably Harvard’s most recognizable name.
“He’s one of those tremendously elusive backs, an all purpose back,” Murphy said. “He’s an outstanding runner. When we put him in the slot, he’s an outstanding receiver. There’s not a lot of guys who can do it all. He’d also be an excellent third down back because he’s an elusive pick-up guy.”
While the Crimson’s final two competing athletes, Obi and Osborne (known to teammates as “Ozzy”), may not have made as many highlight-reel plays as Gordon, Iannuzzi, and Zych, they have helped Harvard maintain its dominance along the line of scrimmage on both offense and defense.
Fittingly, the pair shared the Joseph E. Wolf award given to the team’s top interior linemen. While both are small for their position—at least by NFL standards—they make up for it with their speed, instincts, and versatility.
“Chuks probably need to get a little bit bigger to play inside at the NFL level, but he’s a big, strong, athletic, physical defensive lineman,” Murphy said. “He may be an end at their level, he was a tackle at our level...Ozzy, kind of the same thing. Ozzy’s a very athletic offensive lineman, was a tight end in high school, probably just a tad light right now.”
The five athletes began training with Frazier just after the Harvard-Yale game to prepare themselves for the tests.
“Training with coach Frazier’s been great,” Zych said. “He’s very good...If you asked any of us, we’d all say coach Frazier did a great job.”
The coming months will reveal whether these five Crimson standouts will be able to continue their football careers. But a love of the game was enough to keep them coming back for another go on the gridiron.
“I think I would be lying to say I came to Harvard expecting to play pro football,” Zych said. “I came to Harvard for the school and to play football...I had a great opportunity, and I’d love to try it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On most days, Tommy Amaker travels from his home in Newton to Harvard’s Lavietes Pavilion, where he works from his office.
But once a month, the fourth-year Harvard men’s basketball coach adds a different element to his routine.
On these days, Amaker pays a visit to Harvard Square restaurant Henrietta’s Table. It is there that Amaker meets with nearly a dozen predominately African-American scholars, doctors, and businessmen from the Boston area for a monthly breakfast that provides an opportunity for the group to share in conversation, laughter, and good-natured trash talking.
“We get there, we eat, we solve the world’s problems, and then we go back out in the world,” Amaker explains with a laugh.
The breakfasts, which began in 2007 when Amaker first arrived at Harvard, offer Amaker and the other attendees a chance to stay connected to the community, develop friendships, and learn from others.
Participants include Harvard Law School professors Charles J. Ogletree Jr. and Ronald S. Sullivan Jr., journalist Howard Manly, surgeon Augustus White III, former Harvard Business School dean John McArthur, and local business owner Richard Taylor, among others.  While the diverse group spends a large share of each breakfast discussing politics, current events, and swapping stories, sports is a regular conversation topic.
With the members supporting a variety of different professional teams, lively debates often ensue.
“I never leave there without having laughed heartily,” says Sullivan, who fondly recalls one conversation when attendees boasted of their past athletic triumphs. “It’s as much fun as we tend to be able to get these days.”
While today the group includes nearly two-dozen members, the group has much more humble beginnings.
It began in 2007 when Ogletree—a lifelong basketball fan—learned that Amaker—a former Duke standout who went on to coach at Seton Hall and Michigan—was taking over the Harvard program.
Excited by the new addition to the Harvard community, Ogletree sought to make the new coach feel welcome, inviting Amaker and his wife, Stephanie Pinder-Amaker, to a concert and dinner.
Before long, Ogletree made plans with Amaker to visit one of his favorite breakfast spots—Henrietta’s Table, a sun-filled, moderately upscale restaurant situated in the Charles Hotel.
The original party consisted of four members: Amaker, Ogletree, Sullivan—Ogletree’s former student at the law school—and Manly, the executive editor of The Bay State Banner. It quickly grew as more people learned of the gathering.
“It’s funny, when some people have found out about it they’ve gotten a little—I won’t use the word jealous—but they’ve asked, ‘How come I don’t get an invite?’” Amaker says. “And it kind of grew like that.”
As the breakfast club has grown, so too has the Harvard basketball program’s fan base among prominent figures in the Boston area.
Today, Ogletree and Sullivan own two sets of season tickets to the Crimson’s game—one located on the  new floor seats and the other a handful of rows behind the Harvard bench.
But some of the breakfast regulars have taken on an even larger role than simply a casual fan. Ogletree has emerged as a mentor figure to some Crimson players, particularly sophomore Kyle Casey.
“It’s definitely been a really good experience,” says Casey of his relationship with the professor. “To have such an important leader on campus that always has an open door for you is good, and it’s a great experience to have time to spend time with him and get to know him.”
According to Amaker, this connection between the Harvard basketball program and the local academic community is another positive product of the monthly breakfasts.
“For these guys to come to our games and then to meet the players—they’ve been incredibly supportive in that way,” Amaker says. “That’s another way that all this is such a positive impact not only just for us or me, but certainly for our players.”
But mentoring isn’t all that Amaker receives from his breakfast peers. According to the coach, he also receives a good deal of coaching advice.
“They have all kinds of advice,” Amaker says. “Believe me, they have all kinds of advice and questions and substitutions. They don’t hold back at all. We have a good time with that too.”
But while the breakfasts serve as a forum to bounce around coaching advice, most members maintain that their primary purpose hasn’t changed since Sullivan, Manly, Ogletree, and Amaker met for the first time—to develop friendships and connections to the community.
“Boston over the years has lost a lot of talented people because they haven’t been comfortable here, so you want to be sure that that doesn’t happen here,” says Taylor of the city’s complicated racial history. “It’s really a very helpful kind of network.”
And at the end of the meal when its time to pick up the check, it is Amaker who often steps up.
“I want to do that,” Amaker says. “I’ve been able to reach out and pick it up. That’s been fun for me to be able to do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was awards season for the Harvard women’s ice hockey team this past Saturday, where the squad’s best were honored at its annual banquet.
After ending the season 17-11-4, the Crimson notched second place in the ECAC standings in 2010-11.
After senior tri-captain Kate Buesser ended her career by receiving the John Dooley Award for sportsmanship, enthusiasm, and devotion to hockey, the reigns were turned over to junior Alisa Baumgartner. The only junior on the team, Baumgartner scored nine points and had six assists during the regular season.
Sophomore goalie Laura Bellamy won both the Joe Bertagna Most Improved Award and the title of assistant captain for the 2011-12 team. She will share the captainship with her classmate, defender Josephine Pucci. Pucci shined this past season, receiving All-Ivy first team and all All-ECAC second team honors, to go with a spot on the New England Hockey Writers Division I All-Stars.
The Most Valuable Player award went to sophomore forward Jillian Dempsey. Gaining spots on the the All-Ivy League and All-ECAC teams, Dempsey scored 22 points over the course of the season, ninth best in the league.
Even with the loss of the team’s seniors, Harvard is looking strong for the year ahead, with 15 players from the sophomore and freshmen classes returning.

Planning to stay for Senior Week and Commencement, but want free housing and something to do? The Reunion babysitter application is now available to undergraduates who wish to hang around after exams and make a little extra cash. Although the HAA offers a number of different temporary commencement jobs, the babysitting position is one of the more flexible options, allowing students to choose preferred age groups and hours.
Julia G. Mason '13, who babysat at Reunions last year, enjoyed working with the six to eight year-olds who were under her care in the "Grape Group." For Mason, exploring Cambridge in the summer without the stress of schoolwork was especially exciting. 
 
 
According to Mason, reunion babysitting, at the rate of $11 an hour, offers a great opportunity to experience Commencement before donning the cap and gown yourself.
