After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Police are currently searching the harbor in Portland, Maine for Nathan G. Bihlmaier, an MBA student at the Harvard Business School set to graduate on Thursday.
Business School spokesperson Brian Kenny said Bihlmaier was in Portland with two friends to celebrate their impending graduation.
Bihlmaier went missing Saturday evening after being asked to leave Ri Ra Irish Pub, a waterfront pub near the Maine State Pier, for being visibly intoxicated, according to the Associated Press.
Authorities have been searching for him since Sunday morning.
Portland Police Chief Michael Sauschuck told the Associated Press that divers are searching harbor waters near where Bihlmaier was last seen, using a  sonar to aid their search.
Monday afternoon, police reported that they had found an article of clothing near the State Pier. Kenny said while it is unclear whether the article of clothing belongs to Bihlmaier, investigators were “focusing their search” on where it was found.
The police intend to renew their search efforts on Tuesday.
Kenny said several students and family members had come to Portland to join the search and comfort Bihlmaier’s wife, who is currently pregnant with the couple’s first child. Business School Dean Nitin Nohria, Associate Dean Youngme E. Moon, and a number of other administrators were among those who traveled from Cambridge to Portland Monday to help with the search effort.
The graduate school hosted a prayer service on Bihlmaier’s behalf Monday afternoon, Business School spokesman James E. Aisner ’68 wrote in an email.
“Needless to say, everyone in this community is very concerned,” Aisner wrote. “We are all hoping and praying for the best.”

On Monday, the Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal of Joel Tenenbaum, a former Boston University student who was ordered to pay $675,000 for downloading and sharing 30 songs.
“I can’t believe the system would uphold a six-figure damages amount for downloading 30 songs on a file-sharing system that everybody used,” Tenenbaum told the Associated Press. “I can’t believe the court would uphold something that ludicrous.”
In 2009, Tenenbaum was sued by the Recording Industry Association of America, or RIAA, and was ordered by a jury to pay $22,500 per song that he shared through peer-to-peer networks.
Although a federal judge initially reduced the fine against Tenenbaum to $67,500 in 2009, the original sum was later reinstated by the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
”We’re pleased with this decision,” said RIAA spokeswoman Cara Duckworth after the Supreme Court passed on the case Monday.
Tenenbaum’s lawyers reportedly argued that federal copyright laws were not originally intended to punish consumers, while lawyers for the RIAA countered, arguing that economic impact of file sharing is greater than the cost of a single song.
Tenenbaum’s defense team was lead by Harvard Law School Professor Charles Nesson ’60, a co-founder of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, who took on the case pro bono in 2008.
“The basic thing is that Joel is being held responsible for what the whole internet did,” said Nesson. “It’s like the death penalty for parking tickets.”
Tenenbaum’s situation is rare since few other file-sharing suits have been as drawn out as Tenebaum’s. According to his website, joelfightsback.com, “more than 30,000 people have settled their cases for between $3,000 - $12,000.”
Yet Tenenbaum has been fighting the RIAA and four record labels, including Sony BMG Music Entertainment and Warner Brothers Records Inc., for years, declining multiple settlements along the way in an attempt to clear his name.
“It costs so much to defend,” said Nesson. “[A prolonged lawsuit] doesn’t happen very often.”
Like many other institutions, Harvard University has an official copyright policy that states that “All Harvard users must respect the copyrights in works that are accessible through computers connected to the Harvard network.”
The policy warns students that “Harvard will terminate the network access of users who are found to have repeatedly infringed the copyrights of others, and may also take disciplinary action.”
Nesson did not think that the Supreme Court’s decision would influence University policies regarding file sharing or compel them to make any changes.
“This didn’t do anything...the Supreme Court just refused to review it,” said Nesson, who emphasized the refusal to hear a case is different than a definitive verdict. “It’s almost like it’s no news.”
In the 2009 case, a jury decided the magnitude of the damage award against Tenenbaum.
“From a law point of view the thing that makes so little sense is the distortion of the American jury,” said Nesson. He noted that the jury arbitrarily set a “number within a range” rather than using facts to determine the true amount of damages.
However, Nesson was not discouraged by the Supreme Court’s refusal, and affirmed that there was much work to be done.
We will “proceed in the district court and try to get a rational decision there,” said Nesson.    Tenenbaum could not be reached for comment.

After being convicted of using a computer webcam to capture his roommate engaging in sexual relations with another man, Dharun Ravi was sentenced to 30 days in jail by a judge in New Brunswick, N.J., yesterday morning. The former Rutgers University student was also sentenced to 300 hours of community service, counseling, and a $10,000 fine.
According to the presiding judge, Ravi had invaded the privacy of his roommate, Tyler Clementi. For his actions, Ravi faced a maximum of ten years in prison.
“I’m still not entirely sure as to what I really think of the length of the sentence,” Sanghyeon Park ’12, a personal friend of Tyler and a Crimson design editor, wrote in an email. “If I were in [Tyler’s] family’s situation, I think I would definitely want more than the thirty days.”
In September 2010, Dharun Ravi installed a webcam in the Rutgers dormitory he shared with his Clementi. With the help of a friend, he recorded Clementi having sex with another man Ravi streamed the video on the Internet and posted about it on his Twitter account. Three days later, Clementi committed suicide by jumping from the George Washington Bridge.
Ravi was indicted by a grand jury in April 2011, facing 15 charges including invasion of privacy, bias intimidation, and tampering with evidence. At the time, Harvard Law Professor and Director of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society John G. Palfrey ’94 wrote in a New York Times Op-Ed, “One challenge associated with these laws is to not criminalize behavior that is ordinary teenager-to-teenager banter while drawing a line well before the kinds of behavior that lead to a teenager’s suicide.”
Ravi’s 30-day sentence was widely viewed as comparatively light, and prosecutors and the Clementi family cancelled their planned statement following the sentencing.
“While no one expected Ravi to receive anything near the maximum provided by law, this is a surprisingly lenient sentence,” said Phil Malone, clinical professor of law at the Harvard Law School and director of the cyberlaw clinic. “Many people are likely to see the 30-day jail term as a slap on the wrist that won’t do enough to deter others from callous and harmful privacy invasions in the future.  This was a difficult case for the judge to find an appropriate sentence—one that reflected the extreme harm that resulted from Ravi’s horribly insensitive actions while not overreacting to a tragic outcome.”
Ben DeVore ’15, Political Co-Chair of the Harvard College Queer Students and Allies, echoed Park’s sentiment.
“I believe that such a lenient verdict cannot and will not erase the enormous pain and suffering that Tyler Clementi endured and that his family still face today,” he said.

At the 50th reunion headquarters in Quincy courtyard, a welcome sign stretches the length of the reception tent. There is a pile straw hats detailed with crimson trim and a large button that says “’62,” which alumni wore throughout the day on Monday as they rediscovered the campus they left 50 years ago.
“I think that, for us, it is just a wonderful experience,” said Robert W. Ashmore ’62.
The 50th reunion brought together alumni from around the world, many of whom have not seen each other in decades.
“I met my freshman roommate, and its been 50 years since I last saw him,” said Robert W. Mitchell ‘62.  “It feels like I just saw him last week.”
Some alumni were conspicuously missing from the reunion, but not forgotten.
“Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, was in our class,” said Gary G. Peterson ‘62.  “It’s funny. He’s more famous than anyone else in our class.”
Others met students who shared the campus 50 years ago for the first time.
“The reunions are a wonderful time to meet people you knew then, people you’ve known in the interim, and more significantly connect with people you never knew and you now have an opportunity to meet,” said Roberta F. Benjamin ’62.
For women who graduated from Radcliffe, this proves to be the case especially frequently. Although the women took many of the same classes as Harvard men, the two institutions were still very distinct when they graduated.
“You have to recall that when we were undergraduates, in Radcliffe as the women’s component of the undergraduate student body, we were about 22 percent of the student body,” Benjamin said. “It was a very different mentality that formed the undergraduate education.”
Yet many remember Harvard as a place to grow as individuals and mature in their points of view.
“It was a very edifying experience,” said John E. Kurnick ’62. “I think a lot of us came here as either committed extreme left-wing or extreme right-wing and after spending a lot of time in the dorms and at the lunch tables hashing things out, the left-wingers didn’t become right-wingers nor vice versa but we all moderated our position towards something that we could defend more easily.”
But Kurnick fondly recalled the Harvard curriculum and the hours he poured into his academics back in 1958, particularly Expository Writing, which he says was then called “Gen Ed A.”
“I came back to the dorm room and said that the name of Gen Ed A has just been changed to Gen Ed C-,” he joked.

Members of the Occupy Harvard movement plan to demonstrate at Commencement on Thursday to protest potential layoffs of Harvard University Library staff, according to a press release distributed by the movement.
Occupiers plan to gather outside the Holyoke Center before making their way into the Yard, where Commencement takes place.
The protest, which is slated to include undergraduates, graduate students, and members of the Harvard Union for Clerical and Technical Workers, comes after 65 library workers took a voluntary early retirement package offer, which the press release called “limited.”
Although the library has not said for certain that it will lay off workers, Occupy Harvard is protesting because “administrators have never lifted their threats to cut even more jobs,” they said in the press release.
The release said that protesters will passing out leaflets to Commencement guests in order to “educate attendees about how much damage further job cuts in the libraries could cause.”
On the Occupy Harvard blog, Occupy leaders wrote that they convened the protest in order to reach people from across the Harvard community “to expose the damage that has been done to the libraries already, and how much more harm further cuts would inflict.”

UPDATED: May 22, 2012, at 5:49 p.m.
Harvard Business School student Nathan G. Bihlmaier was found dead on Tuesday in Portland Harbor after a search by police in Portland, Maine, according to Business School spokesperson Brian Kenny.
Bihlmaier, who was set to graduate from the Business School’s MBA program on Thursday, had not been seen since late Saturday night, when he was asked to leave Ri Ra Irish Pub at around 11:20 p.m.. According to Portland Police Department Lieutenant Gary Rogers, he had been celebrating his upcoming graduation with several classmates at the pub.
After the 31-year-old student did not return to his hotel room that evening, his friends called him on his cell phone at 12:15 a.m. early Sunday morning.
“He indicated to them that he was fine, that he was safe,” said Rogers. “Then his phone stopped taking messages.”
Rogers added that the last indication that Bihlmaier’s cell phone was working was at 12:54 a.m. Sunday morning, after which his friends reported him missing to the police.
“It was out of character for him to not be reaching out to somebody,” said Rogers.
The police searched the harbor near where Bihlmaier was last seen, and divers found an article of clothing belonging to Bihlmaier near the State Pier on Monday afternoon.
Portland Police Chief Michael Sauschuck held a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, during which he reported that Bihlmaier’s body had been recovered, according to Kenny.
“This is obviously a tragic event for [his family] and the Harvard Business School community,” said Kenny. “We would have wished nothing more than to have Nathan there to receive his diploma on Thursday.”
According to Kenny, Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria, who had traveled to Portland on Monday to aid in the search, made a statement at the police press conference expressing the Business School community’s grief and his condolences to Bihlmaier’s family, including his wife, who is pregnant with the couple’s first child.
The police will continue the investigation to determine the cause of death, Kenny said.
Rogers said that though an autopsy is scheduled for Wednesday, there is no evidence at present of foul play.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past week has been Senior Week—the capstone to our senior year and to our four years at Harvard. We danced, we sang, we kissed, and we cried, and it’s hard to believe that it’s all over. Harvard was ours, and we were Harvard’s for one last special week. In hindsight, through the haze of time whizzing by and clocks ticking down, this week has meant a lot, but also taught us a lot, and I thought I’d do my best to revisit some of those highlights.
Finishing Classes
Classes don’t matter. Period. Now before my parents and/or wonderful academic advisor murders me for this one, I’ll qualify that statement by saying that it is relative. Classes don’t matter—but people do. Over senior week, the harsh reality begins to set in that you may no longer be able to casually run into people in the dining hall, or even make plans to grab lunch, because you’ll be on opposite sides of the world. Papers and assignments become irrelevant, as does that episode of Game of Thrones or Revenge, because those will always be online tomorrow, whereas your roommate next door won’t. Harvard teaches those of us who pass through its gates a great deal about how to think critically and engage with theory. But it is that collection of peers who gather after having entered those gates that give this institution’s students a world-class education.
Match 12
This annual web-based crush marathon was strangely appropriate for a group of Harvard seniors. We’ve spent our last four years meeting people in Annenberg, losing touch, rekindling friendships, and sometimes—let’s be honest—just Facebook-stalking. Some of us “crushed” our friends and roommates, others “Bucket List” lovers, but in the end, with more than 7,000 crushes made, it seems like it’s gotten a lot easier to say “Hey, you’re cute” anonymously and over the Internet than it has in person. 
But what about those hundreds of mutual matches? Or even those mystery crushers and unrequited crushees? We have only days if not hours to act on them as we see fit, so why wait for Last Chance Dance? Why wait at all, and not just carpe the hell out of this diem? #YOLO!
Midnight Cruise
My best memories of Senior Week—and of senior year in general—are the ones where the class has been together. Now I’m not talking about all 1,600 members of our class being crammed into the Science Center together during a hurricane— that was so freshman year. I’m talking about friends linking arms with roommates linking arms with complete strangers, singing “Don’t Stop Believing” at the top of our lungs in the rain on the top deck of the Midnight (Booze) Cruise. I’m talking about “finding love in a hopeless place” with a thousand other classmates at Royale when all that matters is being right in the here and now. Those moments have been pure magic, and are a testament to the power of the Class of 2012. So here’s to living every week like it’s senior week.
Bonnie Cao is a senior in Pforzheimer House and the First Class Marshall for the Class of 2012.

When Elizabeth R. Holly ’12 first saw Jeff R. Reynolds ’12, he was staring at the ceiling of Annenberg Hall.
It was a few months into their freshman year and Holly recognized Reynolds as a member of Harvard’s varsity baseball team.
“I was with a friend and I said, ‘Let’s go chat with the baseball boys,’” Holly recalled.
Reynolds said he was with a teammate, “staring up at the ceiling because it was so high.”
“I’m sure she was wondering what the heck we were looking at,” Reynolds added, laughing.
The two became friends and then began dating a few months later. Their first “one-on-one” date, Reynolds said, was at a Christmas a cappella concert in Sanders Theatre.
The couple will marry not far from the site of their first date, in Memorial Church, on September 22, 2012.
Reynolds proposed to Holly in September of 2011, having asked for her parents’ blessing during the summer. He took her to dinner in Boston and had invited her family, his family, and six of their friends. The group hid while Reynolds asked Holly to marry him and then surprised her, leading to what Reynolds described as “an impromptu engagement party.”
Next year, Holly, a government concentrator, will be living in Tulsa, Okla., as a corps member of Teach for America. Reynolds, an economics concentrator, hopes to play professional baseball but said he will be living with Holly part-time.
The couple plans to take a honeymoon in the near future and are considering, Holly said, Vietnam and Australia as possible destinations.
But the two say they are looking forward to holding their wedding at Harvard, where they first met and fell in love.
“It’s been really cool to get to meet her here and go through college with her,” Reynolds said. “I’m excited to go through everything else. Going to Harvard with her has been an absolute blast.”

The 128th playing of The Game quickly became all about The Proposal.
After the Harvard football team trounced Yale, 45-7, defensive tackle Josue Ortiz ’12 still had one last play to make. As the crowd flooded the field, Ortiz found his longtime girlfriend, Kayci Baldwin ’14, and without wasting any time got down on his knee.
“It took a while to find her, but when I found her, she was completely flabbergasted,” Ortiz said. “She was shocked—it was awesome. It went perfectly.
Baldwin was so shocked that she doesn’t remember what Ortiz said, but his intention was clear. With friends and family surrounding the couple, Baldwin said yes, and she hugged her soon-to-be husband.
“It was such a rush, such a surprise,” Baldwin recalls. “Then a lot of things afterwards made sense. Throughout the day, my mom kept fixing my hair, and I would be like, ‘Mom, we’re at a football game, what’s the big deal?’... I don’t understand why everyone was trying to get me to look cute for this game, but then afterwards, I was like, ‘oh, now it makes sense.’”
The video of the proposal went viral, with media outlets like ESPN featuring the surprise engagement. It was a fairy tale ending for Ortiz’s football career, which culminated in a lopsided victory over rival Yale and the Ivy League trophy.
The love story began three years ago when Ortiz and Baldwin met at a church conference in Virginia Beach. The normally reserved Ortiz was not exactly sociable during their first encounter.
“I went to introduce myself to him and tried to talk to him, but he was completely not having it at all,” Baldwin remembers. “He was nice, but he wasn’t interested in talking—he was reading the news on his computer.”
A high school senior then, Baldwin friended him on Facebook, and eventually the two started talking more and more, especially as Baldwin was applying to Harvard. She got in, but the two didn’t begin hanging out as soon as Baldwin stepped onto campus.
It took a couple of months, but Ortiz finally reached out to her for a meal at Annenberg. It then became a weekly thing, and after a couple of months of getting to know each other better, the two started dating.
Despite Ortiz’s commitment to football and time spent away from each other—Ortiz took a semester off and spent the past couple of months in New Jersey training for the NFL—the couple has overcome these hurdles during their year-and-a-half-long relationship.
“We’re both very devoted to our faith, and us being in the church made us come together and is something that we grow towards,” Ortiz says. “Our faith helped us overcome all our obstacles and made this relationship happen.”
The couple will be wed on July 7 in Cleveland, Ohio. Baldwin will return to Harvard in the fall, while Ortiz, having graduated in the fall, will continue to pursue his dream of playing in the NFL.
“I’m looking to graduate as quickly as possible,” Baldwin laughs. “So much is up in the air right now … We’re getting married young, but we also would like to start a family young, so we’re definitely just eager to see where life takes us and open to wherever that may be.”

Brooke E. McDowell ’12 was stuck on Mount Washington in New Hampshire and she was desperately trying to text Peter H. Lifland ’10.
The two were friends from chorus—McDowell was a member of the Harvard Radcliffe Collegium Musicum and Lifland was in the Harvard Glee Club—and they had spent the prior evening talking at a party until Lifland walked McDowell home to Pforzheimer House at around 4 a.m.
Now, McDowell, a sophomore at the time, was hiking with her father and had gotten caught in a blizzard. She was worried she would not make it back to campus in time to meet up with Lifland, with whom she was supposed to go to another party.
“I couldn’t feel my fingers,” McDowell said. “My phone was dying. But somehow I managed to communicate to him that I really wanted to see him.”
McDowell made it back to campus later that night, but she had injured her leg and had to go to the party with her knee in an immobilizer and on crutches.
“He [Lifland] was very kind about helping me get around,” McDowell recalled. “Since then we were inseparable,” McDowell added.
McDowell and Lifland will get be married on June 23, 2012, a month after McDowell’s graduation from Harvard, in a Unitarian Church in Seattle, where Lifland lives and works for Microsoft.
The wedding will be small and simple, McDowell said, but there will be a sextet from the men’s glee club performing. The couple says that they wanted music, which brought them together, to be central in the ceremony.
Lifland asked McDowell to marry him in March of 2011, when McDowell was visiting him in Seattle during her spring break.
McDowell could tell something was afoot when she and Lifland went out to dinner. She said he was hardly eating and kept texting people. When the couple went back to his apartment, there were candles everywhere and a giant sunflower in the center of the room. McDowell’s twin sister and her husband “popped out of the guest bedroom,” McDowell recalled, and it was then that Lifland asked her to be his wife.
“After I said yes he got down on one knee and I was like ‘no, no, you missed it,’” McDowell added, laughing.
Next year, McDowell and Lifland will live in Seattle where Lifland will continue working at Microsoft and McDowell, a History and Science concentrator, will apply to Medical School and M.D.-Ph.D. programs.

Almost every day for the past four years, I’ve gone to the Starbucks in the Garage and ordered a Venti nonfat chai, a 20-ounce mix of steamed skim milk and sweet, slightly spicy syrup. As I now plan to move on from Cambridge, I’ve discovered a strange fact about this daily indulgence: I’m pretty sure it can’t be recreated elsewhere. Because the treat, it turns out, hasn’t just been the beverage—it’s also been the place where I’ve purchased it.
There’s something about the Garage Starbucks that just works for me. The location is perfect. Unlike its sibling store at the T Stop, there is almost always a seat available. And the décor—hardwood floors, counter seating, glistening tabletops—lends the place the aura of a childhood kitchen. Even with the latest easy-listening hit streaming over the speaker system, the place feels quiet to me, like a respite, a world away from the craze of classes, problem sets, and extracurriculars.
But I think the thing I’ve appreciated most about the Garage Starbucks is the employees. I’ve seen a few dozen baristas come and go since 2008, but somehow, they always seem to know my order and often prepare it for me as a wait in line. They’re always friendly, and I suspect they really do care when they ask about my day. It’s weird to know that while many of the faces have changed, the store itself has remained aware of me. It gives me a sense of permanence.
Harvard is hard, and in four years of learning, changing, and growing, sometimes it’s nice to have a little consistency, a little piece of peace. The Garage Starbucks has been that for me.

Oh, I remember.
When the student section (capacity: 400) of Lavietes Pavilion had 40, tops.
When a jersey labeled “Lin” didn’t really stand out from anyone else’s.
When the guy wearing that jersey nailed a half-court heave to give his team a triple-overtime victory—and no one I knew was there to see the damn thing.
I remember when it all changed.
When at tipoff, you could look behind your seat at the courtside press table and see an undulating sea of 400 white (or black, depending on the night) t-shirts in the stands.
When the clock was winding down, Harvard had the ball, and you thought the bleachers were about to snap from the pounding feet.
When that press table was moved to the top of the stands to allow room for courtside seats.
When my classmates actually clamored for the chance to trek across the Charles on a cold winter evening.
When The Sports Guy showed up.
When the home crowd believed, above all else, that its squad would win—and it did.
Oh, I’ll remember.

Chelsea D. Barry ’12 and Tyler B. Runge ’12 can thank a number of chance encounters during freshman year for a four-year relationship that culminated in their engagement just over a week ago.
On move-in day, they took their Harvard ID photos next to each other in Boylston Hall. That night, they met again in the Science Center after a power outage in Harvard Yard forced all freshmen from their dorms. Later, they were assigned to the same Expos class, Faith and Doubt.
But first and foremost, they may owe it to Facebook.
“It’s slightly embarrassing—technically we met on Facebook,” Runge said. “We were both members of the Harvard 2012 group we all joined before freshman year. I had gone through and randomly friended a bunch of people and she happened to be one of them. We just started talking online.”
Barry, a mathematics concentrator from Plymouth, Mass., and Runge, a social studies concentrator from Orange County, Calif., had many differences, but during the first weeks of freshman year they were drawn together. They began dating in October 2008 and their academic interests have continued to complement each other over the last four years.
“We both love learning and we love being students,” Barry said. “It’s been cool being in a relationship with someone who’s so passionate about learning and about what we each have been working on.”
Each will continue learning next year, as Barry moves on to the Harvard Graduate School of Education and Runge to Harvard Law School.
“It’s really, really great the way it worked out,” Barry said. “Harvard [graduate school] independently ended up being the best choice for both of us.”
But that first year as Harvard undergraduates continues to resonate with the couple.
When he proposed to Barry at the beginning of Senior Week, Runge invoked their freshman relationship. He returned to Barry a book of short stories, entitled “50 Things that Matter,” that she had given him as a Valentine’s Day gift in 2009. In the margins, Barry had added handwritten notes that described how each of the 50 topics applied to their own relationship.
“There was a short story about courage, and what he wrote about that one was he had needed courage to ask me out at the beginning of freshman year,” Barry said.
But, the story said, he found he didn’t need the courage to ask her to marry him.
“He hands me the book, gets down one knee, and gets out the ring,” said Barry. “On the very next page it said in huge letters, ‘Will you marry me?’”
“I said yes, yes, yes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At some point during the 1960s, The Crimson decided that it was time to finally replace its old linotype machines. These industrial behemoths had become woefully outdated, and the newspaper’s alumni pitched in to pull off a massive fundraising drive to finance the purchase of a set of refurbished Goss Community presses.
But when it came time to install the new presses, no one could figure out how to get the old presses out of the building. They were too large, too bulky to be extracted from the building, and the paper’s staff found itself stumped as to how to get rid of these aging, horribly obsolete machines. Then, someone came up with the ingenious idea of pouring concrete over them, encasing them in the material, raising the basement floor several feet, and installing the new presses on top of the old, now buried, presses.
So when the arctic icecap finally achieves its irredentist return to the eastern seaboard, engulfing this continent in another ice age, those old linotype presses will probably survive as some sort of industrial troglobite. The smell of ink and paper, the bundles of papers ready for delivery, The Crimson’s old pressmen and eager undergraduates will be long gone by then. All the things that once made a cold pressroom feel so alive will have faded, relegated to memories and archives.
But when the archeologists of some coming millennium arrive in what was once Cambridge to excavate a site that they believe once housed a very fancy university, they will find these old presses. Down in the concrete, the linotype machine Model 8, No. 47944 manufactured by the Mergenthaler Linotype Co. will still bear the marks of the anonymous workers, engineers, and draftsmen who once rolled that proud machine off of a factory floor in New York.

I am Jewish, which naturally means that my parents’ prime responsibilities were to feed me excessive amounts of food and foster my neuroticism from a very young age. “Put a coat on, or you’ll catch cold,” they warned me. “Eat yourapple, or you’ll get scurvy,” they warned me. And of course, “Never talk to strangers,” they warned me. I spent my entire childhood heeding the wise words of my parents. But when I was 18 years old, I rebelled.
For the past three years, not only have I been talking to strangers, but I’ve been devoting twelve hours every two weeks waiting for them to knock on the door or give me a call. I work for a peer counseling organization called Room 13 which offers “cookies, condoms, and conversations” to the Harvard undergraduate student body. The service offers anonymous, non-judgmental, confidential peer counseling to anyone who wants to drop in or call us on the phone.
It is impossible to predict what people will drop down to the room to talk about. Some come to talk about the exam next Tuesday that they’re “totally-going-to-fail-why-didn’t-Istart-studying-earlier.” Some come to talk about that guy who won’t text back. Some share dark memories, knowing Room 13 is a safe space where secrets will not prematurely leak to family or friends. Some come to make condom balloon animals or to consume gratuitous amounts of free Oreos. Some come to talk about depression and suicide.
Empathizing and listening to people with so many different issues can be difficult. I cannot always relate to or understand every emotional experience. Despite this, drop-ins and callers still feel comfortable sharing with me, even knowing that I occupy a different life situation.Some drop-ins stay only for a few minutes, but others stay for a few hours. I ask questions, they provide answers. Sometimes we don’t say anything at all. Silences are often more powerful than words.

Just over two-thirds of Harvard seniors plan on joining the workforce  after graduation, a level consistent with percentages from the past two  years but still lower than figures prior to the start of the financial  crisis.
Among those members of the Class of 2012 who plan on working next  year, 68.4 percent have a job lined up, according to The Crimson’s sixth  annual senior survey. In 2007 prior to the financial crisis, 73 percent  of work-bound seniors had secured jobs by Commencement, according to a  similar survey of that class.
The consulting industry will be the top destination for seniors next  year, drawing 12.4 percent of the graduating class, a one percentage  point increase from seniors last year. Education, which attracted the  greatest share of students last year following a recruitment surge by  Teach for America and similar organizations, is bringing in 11.4 percent  of seniors, a percentage roughly equal to that of last year.
Perhaps most notably, the financial sector, which has begun to  recover since jobs were slashed during the financial crisis, will  nonetheless see fewer graduates entering the industry. While 10.5  percent of the Class of 2011 headed to finance, 8.8 percent of this  year’s Harvard graduates will be working in the sector.
The Crimson’s survey of the Class of 2012 was conducted through a  secure website that ensured only one response per senior. It drew 420  responses between May 8 and May 14, 2012.
While the consulting industry is the single most popular sector among  graduates, if salary were not a concern, 11 percent of respondents  would engage in public service, 13.9 percent would work in education,  and 17.7 percent said they would pursue the arts. However, only 4.1  percent of respondents said that they are actually entering the arts  next year, and 5 percent said they were entering public service.
Slightly less than half of future consultants said they would stick  to consulting if salary were not a concern, and just one-third of future  bankers would stay in finance if they did not have to worry about pay.
Among the one-third of seniors who do not plan on working next fall,  the vast majority—24 percent of the class—plan on heading to graduate  school, with medical school taking the lead with 6.4 percent of  graduating seniors.
The Crimson’s yearly survey asks questions ranging from employment  prospects to personal health, tracking changes in the student body over  time.
Nearly three-quarters of the senior class considers themselves more  liberal than the average American. With a U.S. presidential election  pitting two Harvard alumni against each other, the Class of 2012, unlike  the nation, is hardly divided. President Barack Obama raked in 69.5  percent of student support, while a mere 13.3 percent of seniors said  they support Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican challenger.
Boston, which typically attracts the greatest share of graduating  seniors, is once more this year’s most popular post-graduate  destination, with 21.4 percent of respondents saying they will stay in  Beantown next year. New York will see 19.5 percent of graduates, and  14.3 percent of seniors will head to California.
Around 17 percent of seniors will be living outside of the United  States next year, with 9.1 percent headed to Europe, 4.3 percent headed  to Asia, 1.9 percent headed to Africa.
But despite divergent destinations, futures, and interests, Harvard  seniors overwhelmingly said they enjoyed their time in Cambridge: 91.7  percent of the Class of 2012 said they were satisfied or very satisfied  with their Harvard experience, and when presented with the option of  deciding on college again, 94.5 percent of graduates said they would  again choose Harvard.

Thanksgiving of freshman year is a time when long-distance high-school relationships traditionally come to a close during the annual Turkey Dump.
But when Amy Chen ’12 and Dylan A. Kotliar returned home to Princeton, N.J. during their freshman year, they rekindled their high-school romance over turkey and stuffing.
Originally afraid of the distance—Kotliar graduated from Columbia University last week—the two committed to chatting for an hour a day if possible, and the pair quickly became experts of bus lines.
By senior year, it became clear to both that the relationship was meant to last. The two plan to marry in May of 2013, after their first year at Harvard Medical School.
In January, after a day of ice-skating—the venue of their first date in senior year of high school—Kotliar proposed at Top of the Hub.
“We’d always been talking about medical school, applying together, and living together,” Chen said. “It wasn’t surprising for either of us.”
The couple supported each other as they prepared for the MCATs, wrote their applications, and practiced for interviews. The applications quickly became a group effort, as the two agreed to only attend medical schools where both were accepted.
“We applied everywhere together,” Kotliar said. “We got into Cornell, Stanford, Harvard, and Yale.”
“We didn’t get into Yale, did we?” Chen cut in.
“Yes, we did.”
The application process also had added perks, as the two used medical school interviews as excuses for weekend getaways. But their most romantic vacation was a week-long trip to Paris during spring break of their freshman year.
On one afternoon, the two were separated on the platform of the Paris metro, when only Kotliar successfully caught the train. When he took the train one stop, reversed direction, and returned to the platform, Chen had disappeared.
Knowing that Chen doesn’t speak French, Kotliar desperately found the metro manager—after riding the subway to the end of the line—and begged to make an announcement in English over all the metro speakers.
Although thousands of Parisians heard Kotliar’s announcement, Chen did not—she had already returned to their apartment.
In September, the two will settle down in an apartment in Boston and begin medical school.
Finally, they can look forward to studying together without the need for Skype.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: May 26
An earlier version of this article listed the middle initial Z for Amy Chen ’12. In fact, Chen does not have a middle initial.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I noticed the little garden between Lamont and the University gates, across the street from the Kong, unseeable unless from above, one afternoon while I was studying in the library for exams. Freshman year, I couldn’t conceive of not studying for exams in Lamont library. Projecting forward, I imagined long satisfying weeks of working in the pleasant, heated third floor of Lamont, studying more and more advanced material. It was late on a Thursday. The lights were coming on up and down Mass. Ave. I was looking out the window at Bartley’s, where I was meeting roommates for a burger in an hour, and I noticed the garden, sequestered against the library wall, green and unlit, a sundial in the middle. Satisfied, I thought about all the times I’d probably sit in that sundial garden in the three years ahead—reading, perhaps, or sitting. Looking at the sun. I’d go while I took breaks from studying for exams in Lamont.
The little garden nook reminded me of a hidden garden in Central Park in New York, where I used to go for track practice in high school. We ran all the loops in the park, the coach just saying get lost for seven miles, so we did. One day we found a garden up in Harlem, on 104th, that was manicured like a cloister although no one was inside it. Huh, we said, and kept going.
I did get to the Lamont garden once. I’d just come out of an exam, last term, in the winter. I had another one the next day, but I didn’t want to study yet. I did a lap of the Yard and thought to go sit in the Lamont garden for a minute. I did: I pushed the metal gate, I took the gravel path, I sat down. I looked at the sundial. Then I took my phone out and called home, because I’d have to do it later anyway, because I didn’t want to waste time. Sitting seemed so decadent. I talked on the phone while I sat in the garden, and maybe that counts.

They say to keep your friends close but your enemies closer—advice that Matthew R. Gibbons ’12 and Renee Roberts have taken to heart.
The couple first crossed paths when they competed against each other for the position of Associated Student Body president in their senior year at the Orange Lutheran High School in Orange County, Calif. Roberts was the victor in a close race that came down to “something like three votes,” according to Gibbons, who came in second. Both cite their close collaboration as ASB president and vice president as the first step in their relationship.
“I think what kind of attracted me the most to him was he was totally—and still is—his own person,” Roberts said. “Especially in high school, I think that stands out a lot because everyone is trying to fit in.”
Some residual rivalry may have persisted in their relationship at the beginning: Roberts laughingly joked about how Gibbons accidentally elbowed her in the nose during one of their earlier dates. But there was nothing but love between the two when Gibbons got on one knee last December to propose to Roberts at Sunset Beach—where the couple shared their first kiss during high school.
“I’m not the best with surprises ... everyday he was home [that winter break] I was like ‘Okay, it’s happening today,’” confessed Roberts. “But it was just perfect.”
Their engagement came after nearly four years of dating long-distance while Gibbons attended Harvard and Roberts attended California State Polytechnic University in Pomona.
“Our faith is definitely a big thing that ties us together. [And] communication—making sure that youre still staying a part of each other’s daily lives—is a big factor,” Gibbons said.
“It was hard, but it was also a blessing for us too in a lot of ways,” said Roberts of their long-distance relationship. “Since we were at different universities, we were able to grow and learn things on our own. Sometimes when you’re a couple ... your identity is your relationship, but we got to try new things and do things that we love as young people in college.”
The couple plans to marry on June 23, 2012 in the backyard of Gibbons’ parents’ home in Yorba Linda before moving to Los Angeles together.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s a stretch of land, no longer than one tenth of a mile long, that I know better than any other. With a little hustle I can make the distance in less than a minute flat. I’ve traveled between my dorm room in Lowell House at 10 Holyoke Place and the red front door of The Harvard Crimson on 14 Plympton Street more than 1,000 times. It can be a quick journey, but it’s enough time to give my mother a call and short enough to preempt any extensive discussion of my drinking habits.
As someone with an attention span befitting our over stimulated generation, I oftenfind the necessity of foot travel irksome. I just want to be where I need to be. So it should be unsurprising that most days, this fleeting journey between my life in Lowell, clamoring bell tower and all, and my life spent inserting Oxford commas goes underappreciated.
There’s something eye opening, though, about the euphoric delirium induced by sleep deprivation. Emerging from The Crimson’s inhospitable florescent lights at 5 a.m., thenewspaper finally safely put to bed, I approach Plympton Street with a newfound awareness. For one, at this hour there are no people mulling about to clutter the scene; it’s just the brickside walks, the chirping of birds, and me.
Backpack on my shoulders, I plod down the middle of the empty, canted street, turning the corner when I get to the Lampoon castle.The castle itself, home to self-satisfied, angsty poonsters, is of little interest to me. But I do stare up, longing for something else: the ibis, the Lampoon’s pride and joy, their mascot. I’ve ventured inside the Lampoon’s walls and walked away arms full and unscathed, but that ibis affixed atop their tower sits so proudly out of reach.
Just as I begin to the feel the pangs of regret for this never-to-be-completed conquest, my eyes and my feet move on to the final stanza of my journey home: Lowell. I approach Lowell’s grand blue bell tower, proudly emblazoned with its gold-painted crest. Neither the Fly nor the community garden distracts me from my awe. My eyes rise up the belltower as I approach, sizing up my auspicious home as the tower begins to consume the entirety of my field of vision.
I will never live somewhere as perfect as Lowell. Maybe its rooms could be cushier, but its elegance is unmatched. I will miss taking this journey home next year, and I will regret the many times I undertook it with my eyes buried in my iPhone. I hope someone would steal that gloating, haughty ibis of a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine—but I guess I won’t be forced to look at it for much longer.

When a co-worker, close friend, or family member goes through chemotherapy, some people shave their heads in solidarity. When my childhood friend broke up with her boyfriend last winter, we both joined OKCupid.
Actually, she made an account first, mostly because her ex-boyfriend already had one. It was free. It was all the rage among 20-somethings, or that’s what The New York Times said. It was fun. (And it was free.)
Her success was immediate. She went on five dates in five days. She had five free dinners. She got a free movie ticket to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (not an ideal first-date movie, but whatever). Who needed a meal plan when you had OKCupid? There was an endless trove of men willing to wine and dine her.
It turns out it’s pretty gratifying to have a deflated ego stroked by men with nice abs posing shirtless on beaches. When dozens of strangers tell you how pretty you are—in OKCupid-ese: five stars out of five!—eating a tub of ice cream on the sofa is child’s play.
Clearly, your ex-boyfriend is a terrible person who’s intimidated by your brilliance and attractiveness.
My friend was an OKCupid genius. She was a master of the carefully crafted flirty sentence. She was witty and friendly and didn’t sound creepy. She knew to talk about sports. She even wore a sports jersey in one of her photos. There was a photo of her walking pensively on the beach. I told her she was the OKCupid poster girl.
One night in my basement over winter break, we spent an hour (okay, hours) going over her prospects. When, in my typically pessimistic tone, I remarked that this is what our Saturday night life had come to, our third friend said, with a shrug, at least it isn’t Facebook stalking your roommate’s friend’s older brother’s former roommate. This, at least, could lead to something. Then my friend started making me a profile.
She picked two of my best “I am not a serial killer” photos and left the rest to me.
Taking cues from her scintillating conversations with bros about sports, I followed suit. Under “tell us about yourself,” I wrote “Rooting for the Redskins growing up involved a lot of face palming.” Of course, my knowledge of football was based on my dad’s mood during Chinese dinner on Sundays. But they would never know. Drop a Jeremy Lin reference, and I was golden.
Under “the most personal thing you’re willing to admit,” I wrote about my unapologetic adoration of the show Teen Mom (My exact words were, “I’m addicted to Teen Mom. Sorry, I’m not sorry.”). Referencing teen pregnancy clearly was going to win me major points. Perhaps people would see it as a thinly-veiled reference to my toddler ... or my maternal qualities.
And yet, OKCupid never matched me with the 6’8” heavyweight rower of my dreams. I was a 93 percent match with a 23-year-old straight male from Cambridge, who was balancing a purple platypus Beanie Baby on his head in his profile picture. What did that say about me?
Maybe you should retake your personality survey, one friend suggested.
I was an 85 percent match with a friend from elementary school. We had gone to the same Hebrew school. But I was a jerk, and when his mom called my mom to see if we could carpool to the local synagogue on Wednesdays, I told her I’d rather become a Christian. Or gouge out my eyes.
Forced to live vicariously through my friend, I kept tabs on her progress with Derrick, the law student; John, the short Ph.D. student; and a nondescript man named Ryan.
But then things got complicated. She didn’t actually like most of the guys, and they were all too short. It reminded her how awesome (and tall) her ex-boyfriend was in comparison. Suddenly, she was juggling five different guys, blowing one off for another, courting new ones while casting off the rejects.
Should she go on a date with a guy who admitted he couldn’t remember the names of everyone he had slept with? It turned out she liked him the best—next to an ex-Mormon from Utah and a military pilot. Should she accept a Facebook friend request of a guy she’d been messaging with? It was a mess—an extracurricular activity that had spun out of control.
One of my more promising prospects (investment banker, ka-ching!) gave me some sagely advice. Or mostly a warning. “Stay in college forever. Never. Leave.” If OKCupid was a taste of what life would be like after college, it made me want to have nothing to do with it.
Maybe college was my last chance to bask in my love of Teen Mom and naps. Maybe I wasn’t ready for OKCupid or other adult things, like going to museums and adopting puppies. Maybe it wasn’t so bad to watch Clueless for the hundredth time and think about getting with my ex-step brother. And there was always Hillel. 
My friend ended up finding her next boyfriend the old fashioned way: at Shabbat dinner at Chabad (the most shameless Jewish courtship ritual, next to an Israeli dancing singles event). Reportedly, he is “smitten” with her. His words to her, not mine.
As for me, I recently walked around Harvard Square with a wad of toilet paper draping down my leg. A benevolent stranger called it to my attention. My come hither face is still a work in progress. Maybe it will be better next year.
Laura G. Mirviss ’12 is a senior in Pforzheimer House. She plans to join JDate next year, as all her mother’s friends have found their second husbands that way. It is not free.

Sarah C. Godfrey first met J. Michael Beckham ’12 in the fourth  grade.that day she went home from school and told her grandmother, “I’m  going to marry Michael Beckham.”
Godfrey’s prediction is about to come true as the two are set to marry in August.
“He was really nerdy and sweet. I just knew in my heart,” Godfrey said.
The couple grew up together in Abilene, a small town in western Texas  and dated in high school, but they broke it off during their freshman  year of college.
Godfrey left Abilene to study musical theater performance and child  and adolescent mental health and development at NYU, and Beckham  decamped for Cambridge where he has studied philosophy, though after  graduation he will be taking courses to complete his pre-med  requirements.
During the spring of their freshman year, finding themselves far from  Abilene, the friends decided to meet in New York, ice skating and going  to the top of Rockefeller Center. On their way down from the Rock, they  found an empty room where Godfrey performed some musical numbers,  luring him “like a siren,” she quips. In an abandoned Columbus Circle,  they found a lone, late-night jazz musician, and Beckham taught Godfrey  how to swing dance. In the morning, they rose early to watch the sunrise  from the Brooklyn Bridge.
When Beckham left New York, the couple was not certain they wanted to  pick up their relationship once more. But both were back in Abilene for  the summer, and they decided to get back together. For the past three  years, they have worked to navigate a long-distance relationship between  New York and Cambridge, a challenge they say has required effort,  sacrifice, and some clear-eyed assessments of their mutual day-to-day.
“We both wanted to make sure that we were going to do it in a way so  we could have full lives in our respective worlds,” Beckham says.
So when the time came to propose, Beckham’s mind drifted back to that  weekend in New York when the two had reconnected. Bringing with him  photos and little mementos, Beckham took Godfrey on what he calls “a  trip down memory lane” after the two had gone out to dinner that night.  Godfrey says she had a nagging feeling that Beckham might propose, but  when the night seemed to come to a close without Beckham popping the  question, she convinced herself that now wasn’t the time.
The next morning, Beckham and Godfrey woke for another early morning  trip to Brooklyn Bridge to catch the sunrise. As they walked up on the  bridge, Godfrey, thinking that Beckham had decided not to propose,  decided to tell him the story of a man she had seen propose on the  bridge to his girlfriend. The man had fumbled the ring, and it had  fallen into the water below. Distraught, the man had vaulted over the  bridge’s railings of the walkway in search of the lost ring. Meanwhile,  the woman stood on the bridge sobbing.
As she told him this story, Beckham was fingering the ring in his pocket.
“If my hand wasn’t shaking already then it certainly was after that,” Beckham says.
Nonetheless he mustered some courage, proposed, and managed to hold on to the ring—she said yes.
The two will be married at Andrew Jackson’s estate on Aug. 16 outside Nashville, Tenn., where Godfrey has family.

Anita J. Joseph: Take me back to the moment when you found out you were one of the 15 hottest freshmen.
Joseph B. Morcos: I was obviously overjoyed. The number of girlfriends I’ve had since has been a testimony to this achievement I think.
Kelly B. Salazar: I received an email and first thought it was a joke, and then I didn’t tell anyone about it because I was weirded out by the whole thing.
AJJ: What are some challenges to staying hot at Harvard University?
Edith Jordan Taylor: I row, afterward my hair is wet sometimes.
JBM: When you have it, you don’t face challenges. I am recorded on the Internet as this incredible thing. But you have to mix it up, like this beard.
Jonathan R. Mason: I work out.
Crystal Y. Coser: First of all, this weather. I don’t think I’ve ever been so pasty. I also really like tater tots, golden nuggets, so that’s tough. I also really like my bed and TV, so that’s tough when it comes to going to the gym.
Stefan F. Botarelli: I feel like there’s no way to answer this question without sounding pretentious.
AJJ: Best or worst lie you’ve ever told
EJT: “I’m almost there.”JRM: I told everyone that I was a Baby Gap model, and everyone believed me, I was so happy.
CYC: “I’m a half-Asian sensation.”
AJJ: Describe yourself in three words.
EJT: Not as hot.
AJJ: Three years ago you described yourself in three words as, “outgoing, fun, ambitious.” Would you still say that?
Elizabeth C. Ahern: I would add, “Energetic.” I’m working for Red Bull next year, so energy has become a big word in my vocabulary.
AJJ: Do you regret any of your answers?
CYC: I definitely do because I have not been able to live some of them down.
AJJ: Crystal, you said about your hottest trait, “I’m really not one to say, but I do love my booty.”
CYC: That was definitely a joke! The hottest trait of my body is my ears.
AJJ: Did you put this on your resume?
EJT: No! Definitely not!
CYC: I don’t have to because it’s the first thing that comes up on Google.
JBM: I definitely put this on my resume especially for my application to the Boston sperm donation center. I make more money than Goldman summer interns.
AJJ: Did you get any special perks for being one of the 15 hottest freshmen? Do people recognize you?
Liinus J. Hietaniemi: There’s been a couple of weird instances where someone in Finland who I don’t know has come up to me and said, “hey I saw you on the 15 hottest freshman list.” There was also a period where Chinese people started adding me on Facebook.
ECA: My dad was so mad because when you Google my name it’s one of the first or second things that come up.
JBM: Last week I got in the same week from three different freshman, “Oh my god you were one of the 15 hottest.” It’s great, it brings people together.
AJJ: Talk to me about hair products. Do you do anything special for your skin, any moisturizers?
JBM: I’m a big couch surfer and I always steal products from the people I couch surf at, and then I just try new things all the time. I think if I use the same thing for too long it won’t work, my hair will develop a genetic immunity.
SFB: My roommate had this stuff called Moving Rubber. It sounds really strange. It’s a hair gel.
AJJ: Any advice for Class of 2016-ers hoping to make it into the 15 hottest freshman?
ECA: Don’t ever read on Barstool what people write about you.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University rarely plays the role of underdog, but when the Crimson softball squad traveled across the country to compete in the Regional round of the 2012 NCAA tournament, the odds were stacked against it as the lowest ranked team in its bracket.
So when Harvard topped the higher-seeded No. 50 Maryland Terrapins and No. 23 Texas Tech Red Raiders to advance to the Regional Final, it cemented the team as one of the best in Ivy softball history. An Ancient Eight team had not won a game in the tournament since 2005. For the Crimson, it had been twice as long. The last time an Ivy squad made it as far as this year’s Harvard team was 1996, when the game was played completely differently.
When Princeton won the Ivy League and advanced to the 1996 tournament, the regional rounds were actually regional, meaning that they did not have to face the traditionally stronger southern and western teams.
By 1998, the setup of the tournament was altered as the top eight ranked teams were each sent to different regions. That meant that in Harvard coach Jenny Allard’s first trip to the tournament, her Crimson squad would have to beat a top-tier Oklahoma squad twice to advance past the regional stage. That proved impossible, as Harvard fell to the Sooners, 8-0 and 3-0, despite besting Boston College.
Harvard made it back to the tournament two years later but was summarily sent home by the Sooners and Northwestern. The Crimson went without victory in its next two NCAA trips in 2007 and 2011.
In 2012, Harvard would have to beat much tougher competition to match the 1998 team’s tournament performance. The NCAA tournament is now configured in such a way to make each region similarly competitive from top to bottom, eliminating the regional aspect of competition all together.
The Crimson proved up to the task, though, thanks in large part to the play of co-captain pitcher Rachel E. Brown ’12. In the team’s four tournament games, Brown threw every pitch for Harvard while posting a 2.17 ERA.
Offensively, the 2012 team proved stronger than the previous year’s team that was shut out in both of its tournament contests. Led by Jane E. Alexander ’12, Ashley K. Heritage ’13, and Kasey L. Lange ’14, the Crimson bats provided enough offense to avoid elimination in back-to-back games Saturday.
That depth was not the result of a season of hard work or an influx of talent; it was the product of years of training.
“You look at the season, and for coaches this isn’t about working hard for one year,” Allard said. “These are years of development that culminate in one great season. It’s not like you worked hard from September to May, it’s a four-year process.”
For Allard though, the process has been even longer. Since taking over a middling program in the mid-1990s, the former Michigan standout has transformed the program into a perennial contender, within the Ivy League and now on a national level. The 2012 year culminated her most successful four-year run and sets the stage for even more success in the coming years.
“She’s made them better at Harvard,” said Cindy Cohen, who led Princeton to the College World Series in 1996. “I knew she would do a great job. She’s a really good coach.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Co-captain Brogan Berry may not have led the Harvard women’s basketball team in scoring, but she seemed to lead the team in nearly every time of need. Whether it was sealing an upset win at the free throw line, shutting down one of the Ivy League’s top scorers in a crucial conference match, or scoring a season-high 26 points to help the team pull out a historic tournament win, Berry seemed to do it all for the Crimson during the 2011-12 season.
“Senior year, it’s always in the back of your mind that you always have to go out and do whatever is possible to get the win,” Berry says.
Time and time again, she followed through on that desire. In a February matchup with Penn, Harvard entered the locker room at halftime in a battle. Quaker Alyssa Baron, the second-leading scorer in the conference, had scored 18 points in the first half. Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith knew an adjustment had to be made. So she had Berry guard Baron.
In the second half, the prolific scorer was held scoreless. On the other end of the court, it was Berry’s turn to light up the competition, as she netted 18 points of her own in the second half on six-of-six shooting from the field and four-of-four shooting from the charity stripe. More impressively, the point guard was doing it all with a bandage covering her damaged wrist.
After coming up short in the race for the Ivy title once again, Berry and the team quickly refocused for a road WNIT bout with Hofstra.
Berry asserted herself in the game, sinking four three-pointers in the first eight minutes.
That early outburst wasn’t enough though, as the team had to rely on her again in the final minute.
Up three, Berry blocked a three-point attempt. It was her only rejection of the year, and it came at the biggest of times.
On the following possession, the co-captain nailed two free throws to put the game out of reach. The win was the first ever for an Ivy League team in the WNIT.
“Against Hofstra she couldn’t miss; that was the thing, she just couldn’t miss,” junior Miriam Rutzen says. “She could’ve taken every shot—it was just so exciting and so entertaining to play with that. She just played with the utmost confidence and positivity. It was a beautiful thing.”
