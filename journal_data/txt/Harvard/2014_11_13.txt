After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Gilbert and Sullivan Players’ production of “The Gondoliers; or, The King of Bartaria,” which ran from Oct. 30 to Nov. 9 at the Agassiz Theater, was an innovative rendition of the classic Gilbert and Sullivan comedy. The musical was bound to entertain anyone looking for a two-hour treat of impeccable acting and singing accompanied by a sensational set design and a live orchestra.
First performed in 1889, “The Gondoliers” is a comedy with a zest for romance and mystery that takes place in Venice as well as the fictional country of Barataria: a duke’s daughter, Casilda (Camille L. Crossot ’16), sets on a journey to find her long-lost husband she married as an infant, while she is in fact in love with the family’s drummer boy, Luiz (Rahul Kulka). Her husband is supposed to be one of the Venetian gondolier twins, Marco (Matthew Hennek) and Giuseppe Palmieri (Charlie V. Caplan ’15), who were brought up in secrecy. Not knowing their own identities as the heirs to the throne, they get married to other women within the first 15 minutes of the show. In the fast-paced cob web of comedic love triangles and mysteries surrounding birth, every second of “The Gondoliers” proves to be a surprise.
Among the exceptionally talented cast of actors, three deserved particular attention. Crossot, with a penetrating yet rich soprano voice and equally captivating acting skills, conveyed the dramatic yet innocent personality of Casilda. She also had great chemistry with Asia T. Stewart ’18 (who plays her mother, the Duchess of Plaza-Toro) and Jack F. Weyen ’16 (who plays her father, the Duke of Plaza-Toro). Moreover, Weyen always brimmed with energy and expertly handled slapstick acting as well as Rossini-style parlante, providing invaluable comic relief. Acknowledgement should also be given to C. E. Chiemeka Ezie ’15 as Don Alhambra del Bolero, whose wide range of acting added much sass as well as needed tension and weight to the show. The two gondolier couples (Katie Norchi, Alice F. Berenson ‘16, Hennek, and Caplan) also formed a great quartet and became a solid backbone of for the musical. The balance between Norchi’s soprano and Berenson’s alto was superb. The immaculate collaboration between Hennek and Caplan is another gem of the show; they even sang a song (“Replying we sing”) in turn by measure, musically conveying their identity as twins.
The stage design by Evan R. Schueckler ’15 was exquisite and immediately placed the audience in quattrocento Venice. There were no superfluous props, and everything was smartly designed. In Act I, two Venetian palazzi receded on both sides to form a one-point perspective, representing the spatial depth very effectively. Using the first arch on each building as the exit for the actors was a practical yet witty decision. The landscape view of Venice at the very back of the stage harkened back to Canaletto’s Venetian paintings. Also impressive was the movable gondola, almost reminiscent of the one in Broadway production of “The Phantom of the Opera.” Act II provided even more depth to the stage and creative possibilities for blocking by placing four rows of the expertly painted gothic columns so that they recede as a viewer looks down the stage. The transition from the bright, neon colors of Act I to the muted tones of Act II helped significantly in differentiating the atmosphere of the two halves.
Another nod goes to the orchestra, conducted by music director Samantha K. Heinle ’16, which was in harmony with the actors’ singing on an emotional level. The orchestra’s incredible mastery in dynamics, from the barely audible pianissimo to the roaring fortissimo, was particularly impressive. The musicians’ expertise could best be felt at dramatic moments like the arrival of Luiz’s mother, who holds the key to the identity of the King; during this scene, the strings’ escalating notes through sautillé bowings created great suspense. Although the play itself did not present great variety in terms of musical genre, the orchestra more than made up for this by enlivening it with diverse textures.
“The Gondoliers” may be a solid 19th-century comedy, but G&S leapt across the time gap and brought the work alive with great expertise in multiple areas. It entertained and captivated, so that many probably left the doors of Agassiz Theater whistling the tune of the gondoliers.

Wallace Roney, a talented and worldly jazz trumpeter, is currently on campus as part of an Office for the Arts Fall Jazz Residency. Roney, who has performed with his own band on and off since the late 1980s, has worked with a varied medley of collaborators since he first began learning the trumpet at age six. He is the only trumpet player that music legend Miles Davis ever personally mentored.
Roney has been collaborating with the Harvard Jazz Bands to celebrate the legacy of Miles Davis. Their joint performance, “A Tribute To Miles Davis,” was held on Nov. 8 in Lowell Lecture Hall. Before the show, The Crimson sat down with Roney to discuss his work and influences.
The Harvard Crimson: Tell us about “A Tribute to Miles Davis.”
Wallace Roney: I’m going to be playing with the Harvard Jazz Band—the Sunday band and the Monday band. So they’re going to be playing selections and compositions associated with Miles Davis.
THC: Will you be improvising alongside them?
WR: Jazz solo is improvisation. We don’t read our solos, we read the melodies or we read the compositions. Then we develop our own themes. If you’re reading someone else’s solos, you’re not playing jazz, you’re reading the compositional part of the music. Unless you’re quoting a great solo—you might want to quote something from John Coltrane or Charlie Parker. That’s still a part of improvising, though.
THC: Tell us about the trumpet in particular. Was there a reason why you chose this instrument at such a young age?
WR: My father and his friends—and a lot of people in Philadelphia—were very much into jazz. And different households would have friends come over on weekends to listen to music. My father’s household was one of those. The guys would come over—every Friday, they would buy the latest records and come to my father’s house to sit and listen…. My father also loved the trumpet; he started to take lessons, and he bought one. I saw him play, and it was amazing. And that’s what I wanted to do when I heard the sound off the records. I heard Miles’s records, I heard Lee Morgan with Art Blakey, "Cannonball" Adderley, and all these guys, Blue Mitchell with Horace Silver. And the sound just spoke to me.
THC: How do you walk the line between innovation and tradition?
WR: Innovation is the tradition. What you’re trying to do is create music. Eventually, the music forms itself and changes. Or evolves. That’s the innovation right there. If someone has an idea that jumpstarts it, then that is what has been happening all along. So innovation is the tradition.
THC: A lot of creativity comes from daily experience. Where do you find creativity in your daily life?
WR: Creativity is the art of doing something you need. If you’re going to drink coffee on a daily basis, what if you drink coffee and add something special to it? Or take something away? Creativity is something that changes the way you think. Making the ordinary better, trying to make the daily routine better.
THC: Excellent musicianship is often enhanced by great collaboration. You’ve worked, for example, with some of the best drummers in contemporary jazz. Who are your favorite people to work with and why?
WR: First of all, they always say I’ve worked with the best drummers in jazz. I’ve also worked with some of the best piano players! I’ve played with all the greatest artists, and all of them have been special. Because that’s what you do—you find the beauty in everything.
THC: What do you think is most important when teaching the art of music?
WR: I think teaching the art of music is an art. It has been taught for the last 1000 or more years in a systematic way in Europe and in Africa, both performing and watching the masters. In jazz, you have both. You learn in a systematic approach, in a classical approach, and you learn from a master…. Probably, when you’re becoming a doctor, you learn both from the surgeon and [from the book]. And watching things that are not in the book that will be part of the book someday.
As far as my teaching, I had some very great teachers, classical and jazz. Dizzy Gillespie and Clark Terry were ones who really taught me a lot. Art Blakey was probably one of the greatest teachers of all time, as well as being one of the greatest innovators on the drums. And then of course we have Miles Davis, who was one of the most innovative musicians in the last 200 years. I learned a lot from Herbie [Hancock] and Wayne Shorter. I don’t consider myself a teacher, per se, but when I do clinics and workshops, it’s easier for me because I can talk about what I learned from these guys…. Performers are still the geniuses, but the teachers are the administrators, and they’re to be respected.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This semester, I was elected to the Undergraduate Council. After I had been on the UC for several months, my roommate one day casually remarked in passing: “The UC is so lame.” I was very much taken aback. Here was someone who was aware of the many hours I devote to UC meetings and various UC projects, yet her perception of the UC still remained unchanged. It made me realize how ingrained this notion is in our school's psyche. Our default view is that the UC is a joke.
You know what I mean. You’ve heard your friends call the Undergraduate Council self-interested and egocentric. You’ve heard them make jokes about its inefficacy, about how its members join not to change things on campus but to pad their resumes and boost their soon-to-be fledgling political careers.
And honestly, I used to think the UC was lame, too.
But now I strongly object. The UC is not a joke, and it's a shame if we let it be one.
The main issue is that many students simply don't know what the UC does. UC reps gather every Sunday for two hours to debate legislation. Many more hours are spent in committees, sub-committees, and meetings with deans and student groups. This past semester, the UC brought table numbers back to Annenberg, piloted a CharlieCard integration, increased funding for club sports, provided tickets for students to see Jason Derulo and the Dalai Lama, and took stances on Q Guide difficulty scores, unwarranted video-monitoring, and smaller section sizes. I may be biased, but this is substantial progress for a group that not only must work in line with Harvard’s administration but also suffers from a lack of stable institutional memory, as the council is wiped clean and reelected every year.
We may have our fair share of egotists (after all, we are representatives of the Harvard student body). But the majority of reps I know actively enjoy devoting their time to improving their immediate community. The lively debate I witness every Sunday night is testimony to how much reps care about thoughtfully speaking out for their peers.
Perhaps I've gone over to the dark side and let all the power and hot air fill my head. Fair enough. But I would like to point out that the notion of the UC as a joke is not an isolated trend. It’s exemplary of a larger cultural and political problem. In the recent midterm election, only 36.4 percent of eligible American voters actually voted—the lowest voter turnout in 72 years. I shudder to imagine what the voting percentage was among Harvard students, and the myriad of excuses that go along with non-voting.
Voter apathy and disengagement are broader institutional problems that I can’t tackle here. Instead, I urge students to think deeply about the dangers of political alienation, especially as the UC presidential race gets underway. Let’s ditch the pervasive idea that “my vote does not matter” or “whoever wins does not matter.” It matters. It matters because the UC is responsible for allocating a budget of about $450,000, which students pay into via their term-bills. It affects the way meetings are run, how agendas are set, and what stances are taken. It affects whether well-intentioned reps are given the support they need to pursue their projects. Most importantly, it affects the type of person who might run in the future.
In the coming week, you will be bombarded by slogans and attempts at humor (a byproduct of the Sam and Gus era). You will walk by tacky flyers plastered throughout your entryway and the Science Center. You will see a rebirth of Facebook profile pictures as they're edited to match campaign color schemes. This is all simply a reflection of the media manipulation and marketing already rampant in American politics. Don’t fall for it.
Instead, demand more out of your candidates. Attend the IOP and Crimson debates. Grill them with the hard questions, make them squirm. Ask yourself: Who would be the best student voice at a board meeting chaired by President Faust and other deans? Whom can I rely on to be the face of Harvard College, representing me and my fellow students?
Then vote. And after voting, keep applying the pressure. Ask your elected reps: “What are you doing for me today?” and keep pressing until you get a satisfactory response.
If being at Harvard is about learning to be a citizen and an active participant in your community, then it shouldn't start when you enter the real world. It starts here, and it starts now.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the head of the Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorney General should uphold law and order. He or she should fight for the weak and keep the powerful in check. United States Attorney Loretta E. Lynch ’81, President Barack Obama’s nominee to replace Eric Holder as Attorney General, embodies these qualities. She is a strong and reasonable candidate for Attorney General, and her confirmation should occur with all due speed.
Lynch has a strong record as a U.S. Attorney operating in the Eastern District of New York. She has been praised for her stance on civil rights: One of her most famous cases as a U.S. Attorney involved the prosecution of NYPD officers for the assault and sodomy of civilian Abner Louima. Lynch has also worked in the corporate sector in white-collar criminal defense. Her diverse legal background should earn her bipartisan support as a nominee.
If confirmed, Lynch would be the first black female Attorney General—only the second woman and only the second African American. The importance of this step cannot be overstated. America continues to struggle with race, and especially with regards to the intersection between race and justice. Appointing a black woman to head the Department of Justice sends a strong message that, while this country is not perfect, the government is trying to take steps in the right direction.
Given the Senate’s current state, it is unlikely that Lynch’s confirmation hearings will happen until next year. The current Democrat majority has other measures it wants to pass while it still has control over the Senate, including a defense bill and judicial nominations. These measures deserve to be resolved; however, the Department of Justice needs a leader, sooner rather than later. The Senate should make every effort to confirm Lynch as swiftly as possible.
The Senate has every right under the Advice and Consent Clause of the Constitution to conduct a strenuous hearings process before confirmation. These hearings should focus on Lynch’s record and her qualifications for the job. Instead, some Republican senators have voiced plans to steer the conversation away from Lynch and her accomplishments, focusing instead on President Barack H. Obama’s immigration reform agenda.
If Republicans want to convince the nation that they are a strong party worthy of leadership, they should attract the growing base of young and Latino voters—two groups that currently swing blue. The Republicans should work with Democrats to achieve bipartisan, compassionate immigration reform. By instead polarizing the issue to obstruct the Lynch’s nomination, Republicans do no favors to themselves or the country.
Loretta Lynch is an exceptional candidate for Attorney General, one the Senate should quickly confirm. Pragmatism should prevail over politics, and Lynch should quickly begin her much-needed work.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yet again, in a revelation that comes as a shock to exactly no one, we were recently informed that Harvard has been spying on us. Last week, Vice Provost for Advances in Learning Peter K. Bol admitted to secretly installing cameras in select classrooms without the prior consent of either the students or the faculty members, in order to conduct a “research effort” to study student attendance. Which naturally makes me wonder just what kinds of “research efforts” I can get approved if I ask nicely enough.
I know this might be a revolutionary concept to the administration, but if in the future they want to monitor class attendance, they can … take attendance. My middle school used to do it. Essentially, in the beginning of lecture, the teacher reads off a list of every name in the class. Each student will say “here.” Others might answer “present” if they’re smart-asses, and the teacher will mark him off as having attended that particular lecture.
Now I know what you’re thinking. This was an experiment, not an incredibly stupid way to take attendance, so I really should be talking about the ethical ramifications of experimenting on unknowing human subjects. That’s almost beside the point. First of all, secretly taking attendance is the dumbest experiment I have ever heard of, and I took Stat 104, where everyone has to come up with a dumb experiment to pass the course. One kid did a statistical analysis to see if different brands of hot dog bounced different heights when dropped, and even that was a more interesting experiment.
Second of all, if attendance doesn’t matter, but they monitor it anyway, does it still make a sound?
In an email sent after the news was leaked, Vice Provost Bol wrote that he would, “in short order, work to inform all of the students in the courses involved in the study about the fact that their images may have been taken, but were subsequently destroyed” Which is a lot like the NSA saying that they are happy to inform us that they will, at some point in the indeterminate future, let us know that have been monitoring all our online activity ever since Al Gore invented the damn thing. “This was a gap in procedures that is being resolved,” Bol further told us. Hah. I’ll say.
Astute observers will begin to notice the ever-so-subtle trend that the administration does not trust the students or the faculty. Many of us are reminded of those dark, sordid days when news broke that the administration monitored resident dean emails in the aftermath of the Gov 1310 cheating scandal. Perhaps former Dean of the College Evelyn Hammonds is behind the attendance experiment as well?
The lack of trust hardly stops at cyber spying. The administration adamantly refuses to allow the students to spend some more of their own tuition money on student initiatives and clubs, instead spending the money itself. Even the Undergraduate Council can’t swing a measly $250,000 from President Drew G. Faust. Back in February, according UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15, Faust explained that she didn’t find it realistic that the UC should expect the money to fall from the sky, apparently confusing the sky with the rounding error of Harvard’s endowment. Of course, that very week, Faust accidentally stumbled upon a $150 million donation from Citadel manager Ken Griffin.
But no matter; the $150 million pales in comparison to Harvard’s campaign to raise $6.5 billion. What, you may ask, will be done with those oodles of money for the students? A new campus center! So while the administration won’t let us spend a measly fraction of a percent of a percent of that money, at least they’re taking some of it to build a sparkling new center for us. Of course, we are then informed that the center will not actually be a student center, and Comrade Mayopoulos is the only student who sat on the planning group. All of which makes the less informed of us wonder exactly whom the campus center will serve. Could be the NSA.
Which brings me back to the complete inability of Faust’s administration to even pretend to put a modicum of trust in the student body it ostensibly serves. I frankly wouldn’t be surprised to learn that Faust has personally selected the brand of toilet paper distributed to students. She seems too busy to do that, though; she’s booked solidly between raising funds and penning op-eds in USA Today which detail all the ways in which college lets students learn from their environments.
If only our environment wasn’t so circumscribed by email searches and hidden cameras, funding restrictions and a near complete lack of student input. Because it probably takes more than bouncing hot dogs to truly explore and learn.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the night of last week’s midterm elections, the Institute of Politics down on Kennedy Street was not a pleasant place to be if you were a Democrat. Sure, the atmosphere was fun—balloons, Coke, crowds, and conference calls with political operatives, and so forth—but during a night when the Senate was supposed to flip solidly to the GOP, the result was even more decisive than anticipated.
Though the Harvard Republicans occupied a couple of booths at most—and maybe were one eighth of the attendees—they cheered as loudly as the Dems, which was oddly symbolic of political discourse at Harvard. And they had plenty to cheer about. How did Kay Hagan, a popular Democrat, lose to Thom Tillis in North Carolina? Who’s Larry Hogan, and how’d he win the governorship of deep-blue Maryland? Who, on earth, is Scott Milne, and how’d he come out of nowhere to force the gubernatorial race in progressive Vermont into a runoff of sorts? And, by the way, so much for Colorado being a blue state.
While a student, it’s often difficult to understand the political mood of a nation. (I have no idea what the archetypal American worker is thinking about, as I’m not a member of the workforce and I don’t leave Cambridge.) But the unanimous word among the punditocracy is that voters are angry, angry about the economy. And, this in and of itself is befuddling because, in abstract, the economy seems healthy and vital.
Overall, the unemployment rate is down to a very normal 5.8 percent. Under President Reagan, by contrast, the unemployment rate never dropped below 6.5 percent until 1988, his last year. And in states like Virginia and Vermont, where popular Democratic incubents came within a razor’s edge of going down in epic upsets, the employment picture is downright rosy.
As for the economy overall, pure throughput is booming. American GDP rose by an annualized 4.6 percent and 3.5 percent in the previous two quarters, beating predictions. And Wall Street, by the way, is through the roof.
Yet, we can’t get around the fact that Americans are feeling economically choked—a full 70 percent of voters were economically dissatisfied at the exit polls. So what’s the deal?
Basically, it comes down to two figures. Corporate profits are at a record high, amounting, after taxes, to nearly 11 percent of total GDP, the largest proportion since the 1940s, while real median personal income has actually shrunk—by over $4,000—since 2007. The portion of income going to the labor force, to get a bit jargon-y, is also at rock bottom.
Hand-in-hand with the growing prosperity of the corporation has been the growing prosperity of the uber-rich. The growth in the household income of the highest percentile rocketed up 20 percent in 2012 alone, and 95 percent of all income gains since 2009 have gone to the so-called “one percent.” By contrast, this portion was only 45 percent during the economic expansion of the ‘90s.
So, on the whole, the economy is growing quickly, and all the gains are accruing to the actors—corporations and their overseers—who more or less caused thenonsensical, leveraged-up financial mess of 2008-9, which in turn caused the current economic malaise that plagues us.
It’d be unfair for me to claim to know with certainty the reasons for this divergence. But most experts, including those at the Federal Reserve, put the blame largely on the decline of organized labor, and the country’s loophole-laden tax structure. One should also put blame on financial deregulation, which ignited this latest economic turndown in the first place.
Unfortunately, the politicians who’ve enabled all the policies that have led to the accrual of wealth to very rich humans and nonhuman entities altogether, i.e. corporations, and those who opposed or severely watered down common sense measures like Dodd-Frank, are the ones benefiting from the broken world they’ve created.
So, yes, the GOP won this time around. But if the new Congress can’t come up with a new, positive vision for addressing our economic woes, this victory may well be pyrrhic come 2016.
A rising tide, it turns out, does not float all boats.

Parents: Liisa Anselmi and Clark Stith
Home state: Wyoming
Worst lie you’ve ever told to your kid:
Clark Stith: That would take a lot of reflection.
Liisa Anselmi: She’s kind of on to my lies now. She knows when I’m doing the pretend-sad face when I’m not really sad. She’s caught on to that game I guess.
CS: I’ve repressed all of those.
LA: We try to believe we’ve done an excellent job with parenting and that’s why she’s here!
Worst lie she’s ever told to you:
LA: She did try putting out the pregnancy test and pretending she was pregnant, but that didn’t really work out. (Laughter) I knew she wasn’t.
What’s your child’s best physical trait and which side did it come from?
LA: She has, I think, really pretty curly blonde hair, and the curly came from her father’s side when she turned 13. It went straight to curly! I like it; she doesn’t. I think it’s really pretty.
Where is your kid on a Saturday night?
LA: She is having fun with her roommates, usually. She’ll go to the movies. Last night she was at the Comedy Club, so I think she’s doing activities with her House mates.
Describe your child in three words:
CS: Energetic.
LA: Fun and fashionable.
State of your child’s dorm room:
LA: Clean today, dirty tomorrow. They cleaned it for us, right?
Most embarrassing childhood memory:
LA: She had to do a book report for her fourth grade class, so I told her to do commercials and I made her wear a hot dog hat on her head and sing “I wish I was an Oscar Mayer hot dog.” And she denied it to people! Someone came up to her in seventh grade and said, “Didn’t you do that video with that hot dog hat on your head?” and she said “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Any Parents’ Weekend surprises?
LA: I was surprised at the comedy show last night. It was…
CS: Better than expected!
LA: Great, funny. But, boy, they take no prisoners! They’re not afraid to go in the gutter.
Your desired concentration vs your child’s:
LA: She won’t say what she wants to do...maybe she’ll enter the Secret Service. Maybe she’ll be a spy! She’s taking weird classes like Arabic and Government classes, so…
The majority of your child’s spending money goes to:
CS: If we only knew!
LA: I think it’s mostly on food.
Why did your kid get into Harvard?
LA: She’s very organized; she does a lot of activities. She’s a true leader.
CS: She is a natural leader, isn’t she?
What words of advice are you going to give your kid before you leave?
LA: Don’t have too much fun! (Laughter) It seems like you’re having a good time.
In 15 minutes, your child is:
CS: In the shower!
LA: Hopefully in the Yard, but probably in the shower.
In 15 years, your child is:
LA: I think she’ll be working somewhere. Maybe in D.C., or a foreign country.
CS: Public service, I think, is what she wants to do.

“Oh, I’m definitely going out tonight,” a guy in a tucked-in shirt says to a friend as they enter the Institute of Politics at 8 p.m. “It’s election night.”
In spite of its sterile floors and perfectly grained wood panels, the IOP has done its best to give itself a party atmosphere for the election. Campaign yard signs hang from the ceiling like colored shirts from clotheslines. Star shaped balloons and American flags deck the stairwells.
Nonetheless, the scene still looks more like a networking event than a party. Kids stand around in clusters, chatting over cups of punch and sometimes mingling with the adults in khakis who, for some unknown reason, are making an appearance at this "student" watch party.
Not all that interested in pursuing that Senate internship, we instead make a beeline for the food table. The drink selection is impressive: a bright red punch with sliced fruit, water with mint, and hot cider. Red and blue cupcakes aside (“I’m taking a BLUE one,” a woman boasts nearby), the food selection looks a bit like Brain Break: Chex Mix and popcorn. A woman wearing a star antenna headband twirls by with a bottle of Stella Artois, but, after some purely journalistic sleuthing, we find out that the night’s beer selection is a plastic punch cup of Yuengling available for purchase for two dollars. Great party, IOP. Do you mind if we hop over to Kirkland real quick?
The main viewing floor is situated beneath the wall-size TV mounted on the ceiling. Clusters of students sit cafeteria-style at tables below the screen, chatting more than paying attention. Some, however, do the IOP proud—a line of men in button-downs sit, staring fixed at the TV, laptops out at the ready. The dress code leans conventional, but there are a few exceptions. One of the many guys wearing a tie and collared shirt steps out from behind a table to reveal some fetching star-spangled swim trunks.  Another guy sits down next to us and strikes up a conversation, asking, “Hey, what team are you on?”
Half an hour later, the night’s MC makes his first appearance. It’s Rick Berke, who we learn is an important National Political Correspondent at the New York Times. He cracks a few jokes, then points up at the gigantic screen, which is tuned to CNN. “If you want to watch Fox News for a… different perspective,” he informs us, “go to the FDR room down the hall.” Nobody moves.
The party forges on. A massive cake bearing the IOP logo is brought out and cut ceremonially. It’s half vanilla and half chocolate, which we suppose is meant to symbolize bipartisan compromise. This isn’t reflected in the night’s attendees. Most of the Republicans have tucked themselves away in the bird’s-nest balconies on the second floor as we discover by listening to their booming cheers at their party’s victories from above. The second floor also seems to be the seat of choice for those trying simultaneously to do their homework, watch the TV, and refresh maps on POLITICO while actually just stalking that guy from section on Facebook.
Though every moment of political spectating is, of course, riveting, we tear ourselves away from the screen for a minute to visit the Fox News room. It’s in the back, and is also being used by the catering team to store their food. One student stands defiantly among giant sacks of popcorn, watching the screen.
Other Republicans choose to express their pride in different ways. When David Axelrod, Obama’s chief campaign advisor in 2008, takes questions from the main room in a phone interview, a student bounds down from the GOP section. “What’s your name and serial number?” MC Berke cracks. “My name is Cameron,” the student answers, “and my serial number is GOP.” There isn’t much for Axelrod to say after that.
As the last polls close on the East Coast at 10, the atmosphere in the room changes. People set down their punch and $2 Yuengling and stare at the glowing expanse of CNN hanging overhead. Napkins and Chex Mix cups litter the floor. There are cheers and boos as CNN flashes us with various percentage points. The headband woman's antennae quiver with anxiety.
Suspenseful rock music blares. Then, the TV cuts to a commercial for a sexy-looking political drama called “State of Affairs.” Everyone groans.
The night is drawing closer to an end, and the Harvard Democrats are looking glum. One of them tells her friends, “If this gets too depressing, there’s a statue of JFK in the bathroom we can go look at.” CNN calls the Virginia race for Democrat Mark Warner, and the floor rallies briefly with a ragged cheer. But then, several more states get called for the GOP, and the mood dies completely. Downcast Democrats file out of the IOP one by one with plastic stars occasionally stuck to a shoe or two like the toilet paper of a political dream, dead. The Republican booth is still packed and whooping.

This week in the oral surgery industry, I get my wisdom teeth taken out. This was never supposed to happen; my dentist originally justified the ordeal as medically necessary because a “rite of passage,” which just didn’t seem to cut it as a reason for a surgical procedure. Then the teeth actually grew in, and I stopped being able to eat tortilla chips. The upside to removal: A parentally, medically, and school-sanctioned drug experience! The downside: “Reina,” my father says on the phone. “You realize that if you’re on painkillers, you can’t drink cheap wine.” So this time, four dollar wine is about my wisdom teeth.
Laughing Gas
($160, insurance; Oral Surgeon)
The oral surgeon says that I will feel the laughing gas soon, and that I should not be nervous. I am zero nervous, considering that someone is about to use a large metal instrument to pull bones out of my head. The air coming from the nose mask is cool and tastes vaguely of plastic, with notes of holy shit my head is buzzing somewhere near the ceiling, who even am I anymore. Lights blinking. The oral surgeon says, “You will feel a lot of pressure; keep breathing!” I’m breathing like I’ve climbed six flights of stairs, or had an orgasm, or had an orgasm after climbing six flights of stairs. There is a pulling sensation—holy fuck—and (keep breathing) (oh my god keep breathing) I think my teeth are being—holy fuck. “Keep breathing!” the oral surgeon repeats, cheerful as all hell. Breathing! I’m breathing! Jesus, drugs are cool. The grownups tell you not to use drugs, but what they really mean is you should only use drugs when grownups tell you to use them, and if you don’t have health insurance, you’re shit out of luck. Drug laws are a tool of social control that oppress disparately along race and class lines. Nancy Reagan lied. “All done!” the oral surgeon is saying, standing over me with my teeth clutched in her gloved hands.
Vicodin
($6.50, insurance; Walgreens in Central) 
There is no place on this earth bleaker than the Central Square Walgreens. Except maybe the Harvard Square CVS, which was a shining beacon of light until the very kind pharmacist informed me they were not currently carrying Vicodin, and that I could try walking to Central instead. I wept. I then fast-walked to Central. The goddess pharmacist at Walgreens glows in the industrial light/tail end of nitrous, and I thank her with genuine love. I’m walking back to Harvard Square when a suit-clad man on the side of the road decides it is a good idea to catcall me. It is not a good idea. “Hey, baby,” he says, a strange epithet considering that my stature, swollen cheeks, and obvious secondary sex characteristics indicate I am not a small child, but rather a cranky, nitrous-addled bitch you do not want to mess with right now. I give him a big, sweet, open-mouthed smile. I hope he sees the gauze. I don’t actually take any of the Vicodin.
Chocolate Milk
(About $4; CVS)
Five fun tips to make your wisdom teeth recovery fabulous!
1. Having difficulty talking? That’s great. Women should be seen, not heard.
2. Don’t think of your inability to eat solid food as a hindrance; think of it as a diet! Because it’s totally not fucked up that people always tell me I look better after I’ve lost a few pounds due to illness.
3. Prevent boys from even gazing upon your swollen face by telling them beforehand that you’ll be out of commission for menstrual reasons. They’ll run!
4. There’s nothing painting your nails can’t fix, including the fact that you can’t fucking close your mouth, Jesus Christ my jaw.
5. If you’re going to subsist exclusively on chocolate milk for the next three days, drink it out of a wine glass.

When we walk up the steps of Harvard's newest towering edifice, it's clear that everyone is highly aware that "this event will be filmed and photographed." The attendees are slinky and aggressive. Cheek-kissers. Quiet patter-clappers. My friend and I lose count after about 12 tight black turtlenecks.
We are not at a gallery in New York. We are at the student opening of the newly renovated Harvard Art Museums. Whoever is in charge of the event has gone all out. An art museum employee clips on a cleverly crafted paper bow adorned with Harvard H's as we enter. Swirly dance music pulses. I ask a caterer what the vision was for the event.
"This is like a bar mitzvah on crack," she says. She's holding a bounteous tray of tomato basil mozzarella "tartlets,"  which are quickly scooped up by cruising amateur patrons of the beaux arts. The crowd is directed downstairs towards a coat check and, promisingly, "free drinks."
The drinks are non-alcoholic, but nobody seems to mind. Suited bartenders make the mocktails to order. They're standing behind a bar stacked ceiling-tall with illuminated pickle jars filled with riotously colored, surely noxious liquid. I order a "prickly pear lemonade," and sip on a foot-tall pink beverage. My friend gets a uranium-green ginger limeade, and we sashay out to mix and mingle.
The crowd flows up the stairs to the sheer glassed cloister-cum-atrium-cum-dance floor. As with all Harvard events of this scale, the music cuts and the head student tour guide walks onstage to deliver "a few remarks before you get back to the fun."
Thomas W. Lentz, the director of Harvard Art Museums, does his best to reel in the crowd after a student introduction.
"Nothing says party like a few words from the art museum director," he says.
Our companions at the event, ever artily blasé, politely smirk and applaud. Everyone keeps whispering.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana steps on stage and, as always, delivers a mixed message about the space's "reflective role," and impactful changes to the "real lives of students."
A boy walks in to join a group standing behind me. There's lots of cheek kissing. His friend whispers, "Why are you here?"
"I feel like I should love art, you know. I mean, I have a Tumblr," he responds, before making a beeline for the macadamia nut encrusted chicken fingers.
As soon as Dean Khurana concludes exhorting the values of the liberal arts, DJ duo AndrewAndrew of "Girls" fame takes over. The two are a performance art piece unto themselves. They refuse to identify anything about their pre-collective Andrew identity. Their friends and family are rumored to have signed lengthy non-disclosures. They're dressed identically, down to glasses and cufflinks. My friend goes up later so we can grab a picture with them. When she approaches, they unbutton their shirts. They're wearing matching undershirts, emblazoned with a crimson Veritas.
Their advice? "Stay in school. It's like so worth it. And look at the art."
We do. As we walk up the stairs, a strident harp trio starts plucking. The three women are fixated on their conductor. They vengefully, viciously pluck and pull. An exhausted looking male dressed like the Platonic ideal of a Barker Center TF (corduroy jacket, Moleskine, etc.) walks down the stairs. He's had enough.
"I'm incredibly weary of the Baroque."
We aren't yet, and keep walking. The gallery space is almost impossibly capacious. Six floors, dozens of guides and guards, even a "Marguerite Steed Hoffman Reception Area." The "area" consists of a clearly visible desk.
We check out the Western classics, from Rothko to Renoir, before heading to the Islamic art gallery. It's quieter, more studious. A girl with Cleopatra eye makeup is holding court for two of her friends in front of a beautiful Persian miniature.
"Check it out. In the Islamic world, the atelier is incredibly rarified," she philosophizes. Her comrades nod along, no doubt perplexed, but with the smug transcendent air of a Zen master who can hold a koan fully in his head.
My friend talks about print culture with people from her VES class. I speak in French to a friend about a Cezanne. It feels like an elaborately staged caricature of the Harvard "creative people" world.
There are a few individuals clinging to the outside. A girl walks around handing out fliers.
"Oh my god. Check it out. This is the app me and my boyfriend are gonna drop out for."
A nervous-looking bunch in suits cluster around an iPhone.
"They don't understand parliamentary procedure. And they're trying to run the IOP."
Before we know it, it's time to walk back down to coat check. There's a 20 minute line. We double down on mocktails and chatter about a wall-sized series of black lines being continuously sprayed on by a robotic arm. A Harvard Art Museums employee silently and expertly swoops in with help.
"This is a site-specific installation piece. It's being constructed as we watch." She points at home alarm style sensors. "Your movements are triggering the paint. You're just as much the artist here, is what the artist is trying to say."
Before we finish our mocktails, we stand in the atrium and, like so many others around us, take a selfie. Straight to Instagram. "Not art," my friend sighs, and we walk out into the rain.

IN WINTHROP HOUSE, November 12, 2014.
The unanimous Declaration of one very unsure sophomore,
When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for a sophomore to commit to a concentration, mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the concentration.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal, and that all concentrations are not—That sophomores are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of a High GPA—That to secure these rights, departments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the deadline-focused consent of the departmentalized—That whenever any Plan of Study becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the Sophomores to fill it out anyway.
The history of the present Dean Khurana of Harvard College is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these sophomores. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
He has refused a joint concentration in History and Literature and Folklore and Human Evolutionary Biology, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions for a Comparative Dog and Cat Studies concentration have been answered only by repeated injury.
We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, and hold other sophomores, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in different concentrations, in same concentration Friends.
We, therefore, the Representatives of Ambiguously Decided Sophomores, in the Dining Hall, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme FAS standing committee in Special Concentrations for the rectitude of our intentions, do solemnly publish and declare, That we are, and of Right ought to be, Economics concentrators; and that as Free and Independent Economics concentrators, we have full Power to talk about War, discuss Peace, chat about Alliances, establish Commerce, show off how much we know about Commerce to our friends, and to do all other Acts and Things which Economics concentrators may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor and Collaboration Policies.

“Our mission, as we state in our website, is the enhancement of human existence through the advancement of the field of social engineering,” Cengiz Cemaloğlu ’18 says. He’s talking about Reality Theatre Co., a Hong Kong-based company of which he was the director last year. During his senior year of high school, he says that Reality Theatre Co. netted $110,000, completed 34 out of its 35 projects successfully, and received 120 proposals.
At Reality Theatre Co., the potential services vary wildly. Cemaloğlu lists examples. Want a wedding featuring “a swimming pool with people dressed in Indian garments”? Check. How about a dream re-enactment where you’re kidnapped—safely? Double check. Need a fake girlfriend? That can be arranged. How about influencing the relationship of two feuding employees so that they sing kumbaya, without them knowing of your involvement? They may have just the right actor, and plan, to make that a reality.
Could it be engineered so that your neglectful son calls you more often? Cemaloğlu explains that they’ve done it already: After several days of “shadowing” a woman’s son, Reality Theatre Co. paid old women to bump into him in his most frequented haunts. These women told sob stories about their own made-up families. “At the end of the week the guy thinks, is this a godly coincidence?” Cemaloğlu says. He claims that the son called his mother to set up a dinner that Friday.
If this is starting to sound like a screenplay or science-fiction, Cemaloğlu understands. But he assures us that it’s real. With him, though, it’s hard to really know.
***
Cemaloğlu wears a green sweater and a black leather jacket when we sit down in the Harvard Foundation’s office, where he works as an intern. He draws our attention to the desk in the room, the binders on the wall, the white cinderblock; “You never think of changing it, right? You’re not pushing the desk, but I could,” he says.
Cemaloğlu’s life has been peripatetic. Born in Azerbaijan, his family moved to Turkey when he was four years old. He grew up in Istanbul, mostly, though he also spent stretches of time in a host of other countries. He lists his native languages as Azeri and Russian, though he also says he speaks Turkish, French, Spanish, Chinese, English, and Indonesian with varying levels of fluency.
For high school, he moved again to attend Hong Kong’s United World College, which enrolls students from every country in the world. “The idea is that you get over your stereotypes of any nation, any religion, any language, and you see how similar you all are,” Cemaloğlu says.
Gabriel Otoya was one of Cemaloğlu’s peers at United World College. He describes himself, Cemaloğlu, and one other peer as the primary coordinators of Reality Theatre Co.. He explains that Cemaloğlu explored ideas about theatre and reality’s convergence during his time at United World College. Otoya relates an anecdote: For a final project, Cemaloğlu staged a production that began as a “cheesy, romantic play,” until an alarm went off. It was all planned, though most of the spectators didn’t know it. The audience was hurriedly evacuated.
Once outside, they saw that one of the actors in the play—another student—had been injured. Next, more actors joined the scene, adding in fantastical elements like one that Otoya describes as “zombie”-like. The performance “engaged the observers and created this active reflection process,” Otoya says.
Another example of blurring acting and reality involves a student group called Initiative For Peace, where Cemaloğlu created an activity in which students simulated conflicts. The exercise required that Christian students pretend to lose their wallets and then blame Muslim students. Each time it lasted hours. The goal of the exercise was to make the students feel “real emotions,” he says.
So when exactly did his services become for-profit? Cemaloğlu laughs when he tells the story. He attended a dinner party at one of the highest points in Hong Kong, home to expensive real estate prices and incredible views, where the conversations turned to dreams. The hostess explained that she wished her husband could also see a recent dream she had had. He and others offered to re-enact the dream and she offered payment. This relationship later helped garner connections with Hong Kong’s elite as she recommended Reality Theatre Co.’s services to her friends.
The company’s website poses the question: “Is there anything you would like to change in your life or in others' lives?” Then it elaborates, “We would be glad to utilize our social engineering methods with you.” These methods include employing actors, sociologists, anthropologists, psychologists, and more to determine a way to change a person’s life.
Just because a project was possible to execute, didn't mean that Reality Theater Co. would take it on. Projects were vetted based on two criteria: “meaning” and “impact.” Cemaloğlu and a team of peers voted on whether a proposal met both. He says that it was extremely important that each project made everyone involved better off.
You can imagine that the responses have not always been positive. For example, two weeks into freshman year, he told an actress at Boston University about Reality Theatre Co., thinking she would be a good fit for the company. Instead of being flattered, she thought it was creepy. Reality Theatre Co., after all, deals in solving problems in “taboo” areas. “This is the one last bit of peace that is not commercialized in our life, our social life. Our friendships, our loves, except prostitution,” he adds, “are not commercialized.” He elaborates, though, that commercializing these aspects of life is not his goal.
This relates to his biggest dilemma: using the company’s potential for good. “It’s like an atomic bomb,” he says. “It can be used for good; it can be used for extremely dangerous purposes.”
He speaks grandly about the stakes without a hint of humor. “If these tools get into the wrong hands to be used for the wrong purposes, it can really distort the human existence,” he says.
With its previous team members dispersed to different colleges, Reality Theatre Co. is on hold for the moment. Cemaloğlu says his choice of Harvard was a “game breaker” since he wouldn’t be staying in Hong Kong. Nonetheless, he says he thinks about Reality Theatre Co. “24 hours a day,” and has big plans for it in the future.
His long-term hope is to transition to the United States and have three hubs in New York, London, and Hong Kong. First, he’s looking for a co-founder in the United States, which will be critical to starting up in America.
In the interim, he expects to concentrate in psychology at Harvard and is focusing on classes, comps, and meeting at least one new person a day. He explains the impetus: “I know that every single person...is going to help me in the future.”
As we leave, he imparts a bit of philosophical wisdom, quoting a proverb. “The one who never takes risks, never gets to drink champagne.” And then he calls in a troupe of actors to serve us champagne out of a golden tub. Well, not really—but maybe he could have.

Sex: college students are pretty much always thinking, talking about, and (sometimes) doing it. That hasn’t always been the case. Recently journalist Jonathan Eig spoke at the Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine at Harvard Medical School about his new book, “The Birth of the Pill.” The story of the birth control pill’s invention is riddled with twists, turns, dashing characters, and plenty of sexual activity. FM’s conversation with Eig was less salacious, but no less salty or stimulating.
Q: Reviewers have made much of the lack of apparent links between your past projects and newest book. What made you want to write a book about the Pill?
A: My journalistic history is one of looking for the best stories you can find. You jump around a lot. I went to some baseball books and then to a book about some gangsters then to a book about the people who invented the Pill. It doesn’t seem like such a leap. It’s such a great story. I’m drawn to stories about rebels. All my books have that in common.
Q: For many college students, the Pill is a daily fact of social and medical life. What made its invention such a revolution?
A: In the 1950’s, being a woman meant being a mother. Anyone who dared differently dared being labeled an outcast. The Pill had this amazing, huge, almost instant impact on society. You would not have had so many women in graduate school. It’s completely changed women’s opportunity. They could decide when they wanted to get pregnant. That’s something we take for granted now.
Q: You’re a man writing what many interpret as a feminist history. Has that posed any challenges or even opportunity throughout the tour [or] during the writing process?
A: It’s sad that men don’t talk about birth control more. We’re at least a 50 percent partner in this process. The fact that we just sort of punt and let women have all the responsibility and worry for it is wrong. I think as a man I had some advantages. I didn’t have any baggage or any agenda. I wanted to figure out the story and tell it as best I could. Maybe that objectivity allowed me to see things that others would have missed.
Q: What can socially driven entrepreneurs and inventors learn from these rebels today?
A: The lesson for innovators today is that you have to take risks. You have to think big. But it’s also a lot easier to take those risks when you know you’re doing something that’s good for the universe as opposed to something that’s just going to make money. None of these rebels made any money, and none of them really cared.
Q: Since the invention and first use of the Pill, what’s changed about how people use or think about it?
A: The Pill has done a lot of good, but it hasn’t been improved upon the way many thought it would have been. We need to see more and better birth control options, especially for women in developing countries and poor communities. And for men, too. There’s still a responsibility for inventors to look for better approaches.
Q: Why has there been no Pill for men?
A: Men don’t get pregnant, so they don’t care. They should, but they don’t.
Q: What shapes the evolution of that care and investment in these important decisions?
A: It’s a lot of things. It’s driven in part by sexism, the idea that women should have the responsibility of making babies and men can act as innocent bystanders.
Q: The media in the past few years has made much of that disparity in responsibility. Do the “having it all” narrative and Pill fit together?
A: I think the Pill created opportunities and gave women more choices. I don’t think it created the problem of women wanting to have it all. Men have been wanting it all forever, and nobody criticizes them for it.
Q: Conservative cultural critics sometimes decry the Pill for promoting promiscuity. Has the Pill promoted promiscuity? What does that word even mean in a world with the Pill?
A: Yes. The Pill has contributed to more casual sex and more premarital sex. It was inhibited before by the fear of becoming pregnant, and now there’s more fear in some ways. I think that’s a good thing for the most part. People should enjoy having sex, as long as they’re safe about it. Contraception gives people more tools to be safe.
Q: That could be interpreted as a political or religious stance. How do you see your book in a political and/or religious context?
A: I tried to write the book objectively and to let the story speak for itself. I do have my own prejudices, every writer does, and it would be naïve to pretend that any writer truly is objective and impartial. I think birth control has done far more good than harm to society. I think we need more and easier access to contraception. The efforts of some conservative politicians to brand women as sluts because they want to have sex is completely unfair. Nobody’s getting angry at men for making Viagra ads and promoting promiscuity.
Q: A lot of drug companies have been lobbying for faster review periods. Was the quick approval of the Pill historically contingent? Would it be as easy to approve a Pill-sized invention today?
A: The regulatory process has made it much tougher, but the fear of litigation is the biggest problem. Drug companies are wary of dumping tons of money into research when there are a troop of lawyers ready to file class action lawsuits.
Q: Your book covers recent social and scientific history. Who’s still around as a primary source?
A: There were still a fair number of people who knew these scientific players. Their children were often still alive. Some of the women who were among the first to take the pill are still around today. I was able to do a lot of firsthand interviews. The other amazing thing is that scientists write down all of their records. While researching my previous books, I learned that gangsters do not. That was a huge advantage.
Q: There are serious and evolving concerns related to birth control. Innovations like IVF, artificial insemination, the Pill, etc. have led many to wonder if there’s such a thing as too much control over birth. Is there?
A: Look, if governments assert control over these personal choices, yes. It’s possible to have too much control. I don’t think that it’s possible for a woman to have too much control over her body. She should have as much as she possibly can.
Q: The Pill’s invention fueled so many popular movements and sentiments. Why have researchers and journalists ignored this history?
A: It may have something to do [with] that it’s still fairly recent. We might still be getting our arms around what it all meant. It’s also a function of sexism. We view this product as something really only for women.
Q: The incredibly annoying elevator-pitch question—what’s at the core of your book?
A: For thousands of years, women were seen as nothing but vessels for babies. These four brave rebels decided that they could do something about it and give women control over their own bodies. It should have been impossible, but they pulled it off.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Vice Provost for Advances in Learning Peter K. Bol, who authorized a now-controversial lecture attendance study that involved photographing students without their knowledge last spring, notified the students who took the affected courses by email on Wednesday.
The message did not specify which courses researchers monitored as part of the study. The study involved 10 courses and roughly 2,000 students, according to an October presentation on the study’s findings.
Students in Physical Science 3: “Electromagnetism, Circuits, Waves, Optics, and Imaging,” Statistics 104: “Introduction to Quantitative Methods for Economics,” and Economics 1010b: “Macroeconomic Theory,” were all photographed as part of the study, according to their respective course instructors, Physics lecturer Logan S. McCarty, senior Statistics lecturer Michael I. Parzen, and Economics professor of the practice Christopher L. Foote.
The Crimson first identified those courses as potential subjects of the study through an analysis that involved cross-referencing enrollment data and syllabi from dozens of lecture courses with the October presentation on the study’s findings. When presented with a list of 10 courses that The Crimson identified through the analysis, Bol declined to confirm any of them, writing in an email that he only had permission to identify courses in the study for “research purposes where having the course identity would make further research possible.”
While it did not offer more information on the courses involved, Bol’s email to affected students Wednesday provided details on how cameras were used in classrooms.
“The methods of the study involved photographs of lecture halls and a computer algorithm to differentiate filled from empty seats with no identification of any individual student, and subsequent destruction of the underlying images,” Bol wrote to students, according to a copy of the email shared with The Crimson. “The researchers involved in this study do not know who was enrolled in the courses that were photographed.”
Bol’s notification email arrived in students’ inboxes amid ongoing controversy surrounding the study, news of which broke at the most recent meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences last week. Both students and faculty members have called on the University to provide more information on the study, and at least one law firm is currently looking into possible legal action against the University.
Kyros Law in Hingham, Mass. is actively seeking faculty and students to take part in a potential class action lawsuit against the University for allegedly violating privacy and breaking state and federal laws through the attendance study.
Some professors, though, questioned the purpose of such a lawsuit this week.
“A lawsuit is an awful way to sort out a situation like this one,” Computer Science and Law Professor Jonathan L. Zittrain wrote in an email Monday to The Crimson, adding that “there may be reasons to rethink how studies of this sort are done—who approves them, and who's informed about it before, during, and after —but I don't see any useful role for a lawsuit here, and I suspect the plaintiff's firm is rather hoping to simply settle, banking on the University not wishing ongoing bad publicity.”
In an interview Monday, Konstantine Kyros, an attorney for the firm exploring the possibility of the class action lawsuit, said that he hopes to speak with students while also exploring the technicalities of the Institutional Review Board approval process for human subjects, ultimately deciding in the coming weeks whether to bring a case against the University.
HarvardX spokesperson Michael P. Rutter declined to comment on the record about the potential lawsuit.

The Committee on the Study of Religion endorsed a 12-student cap on section sizes Tuesday, becoming the sixth department or committee to extend its support of the Harvard Teaching Campaign, a group of teaching fellows and students calling for smaller sections.
According to Committee Chair Michael J. Puett, members unanimously endorsed the motion to limit sections to 12 students. The motion does not necessarily mean that courses under the committee’s supervision will see smaller section sizes.
Puett, who teaches Ethical Reasoning 18: “Classical Chinese Ethical and Political Theory,” said on Wednesday that he believes oversized sections can have a significant negative impact on the degree of active learning that takes place in the classroom.
Puett said that financial concerns pose a major barrier to reducing section sizes, but that Harvard’s educational mission justifies the investment.
“It costs money to do this, but we are an educational institution, and this is a great place for us to put our money to make a statement that we really care about education,” Puett said. “Hopefully we’ll make a large argument to the universities throughout America that this is something we think is important.”
So far, the departments that have endorsed the section cap are all in the humanities or the social sciences. Luis A. Perez ’16, an organizer of the Teaching Campaign, said undergraduate members of the group are ramping up outreach to the faculty of departments in the sciences.
A referendum question on reducing section sizes to 12 has been placed on the upcoming Undergraduate Council election ballot, after a petition to submit the question for referendum vote garnered 1,374 undergraduate signatures. Puett sent an email last week to students enrolled in Ethical Reasoning 18, about 700 in total according to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar’s Office, to make them aware of the ballot question.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students, faculty, and administrators debated how to improve the Q Guide’s difficulty rating, an online metric on Harvard’s course evaluation tool that has been a recent source of tension between students and administrators, at the semester’s final Committee on Undergraduate Education meeting on Wednesday.
Following a Faculty Council decision made last year, students will no longer have access to their peers’ responses to the course difficulty rating question on the Q beginning next semester. The data will still be made available to faculty members.
On Wednesday, CUE members discussed how best the Q could clearly convey information about the relative difficulty of a course and whether it should ask students to comment on a course’s difficulty at all.
At the end of the meeting, committee members agreed that the four undergraduates who attended should compile a list of three or four questions related to course difficulty—such as course organization, workload, and time commitment—that they would like to see administered with the Q survey at the end of each semester. The committee tasked the students with compiling those questions by the group’s next meeting in February, but Brett M. Biebelberg ’16, an Undergraduate Council representative who is on the CUE, said he would like “some movement” sooner.
“We want to move as quickly as possible because we don’t want to give the impression that the administration can sit on this and wait it out,” Biebelberg said after the meeting.
Already, half a year has transpired since Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris announced that the Q guide would no longer publicly display difficulty scores. More than a year has passed since the Faculty Council officially approved the changes in September 2o13.
Despite student backlash at the decision, the Faculty Council has not formally discussed additional changes to the Q this semester, according to Computer Science lecturer Henry H. Leitner, who sits on the Council and CUE.
At their meeting Wednesday, committee members questioned the discrepancy between the Q data that is available to students and faculty members. Administrators pulled up a page on the Q Guide from biological sciences professor Daniel E. Lieberman’s spring 2014 course Life Sciences 2: “Evolutionary Human Physiology and Anatomy” to show what faculty members see when they log in to the Q.
Faculty members, unlike students, can view the individual comments students write in response to the Q’s many short answer questions. Students can see their peers’ responses to just one such question: “What would you like to tell future students about this class?” Faculty members can also sort comments according to various course rating data.
At their meeting Wednesday, a plurality of CUE members agreed that administrators should give students access to most, if not all, of the data that faculty members can see.
According to Biebelberg, the UC may consider polling students over the next three months about what kind of questions they want to see asked on the Q. There will also be a referendum question on the UC’s upcoming presidential election ballot about the difficulty score.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 11, 2014, at 6:40 p.m.
Harvard’s computer science faculty will grow by 50 percent, or 12 professorships, following a gift from former Microsoft CEO Steven A. Ballmer ’77. Ballmer did not specify the size of the gift.
“I believe in Harvard,” Ballmer said in an interview on Wednesday. “I went to school here and I love the place, and I believe in the power of technology to make a difference.”
Ballmer said that he is “all in” with his support for the faculty expansion, but he declined to specify the value of the donation. Generally, Harvard professorships cost about $5 million to endow, and when prompted as to whether a $60 million gift was an appropriate ballpark figure, Ballmer said that the arithmetic was “pretty good.”
The money, whatever the exact amount, comes with a clear and explicit ambition.
“Right now I think everybody would agree that MIT, Stanford, and Carnegie Mellon are the top places [for computer science],” Ballmer said, adding that some would also include the University of California at Berkeley. “I want Harvard on that list.”
At an event celebrating the gift hosted at the Harvard Innovation Lab Thursday afternoon, Ballmer told a crowd of hundreds of students, administrators, and nearly every member of the Computer Science faculty that the University’s leadership in computer science is “fundamental” to its continued leadership in higher education.
“Steve likes to win,” University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, who referred to Balmer as an “old friend,” said after the event.
The gift comes during a period of rapid growth for computer science at Harvard. Now the fifth largest undergraduate concentration, computer science has tripled its number of concentrators in the past five years, and Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I” stands as the largest class offered at the College this semester with 780 undergraduates.
School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Dean Cherry A. Murray said in 2013 that she expected the School’s faculty to grow roughly 30 percent in coming years as significant portions of the school, including computer science, move to Allston. The computer science division currently counts 24 professors.
“The field is at an inflection point. We’ve been working on problems that are in a sense about what computers are—how to code computers, how to get them to work well,” said David C. Parkes, area dean for Computer Science. “We’re at a point now where the field is affecting every other field. This is what we mean by the outward-facing aspect of what computer science is.”
Faced with increasing numbers of instructors and concentrators, administrators and faculty members at SEAS have said they are concerned about space availability in the years before the Allston move. Parkes said that space constraints will limit the department’s hiring timeline following the gift.
Still, at the Thursday celebration, Ballmer urged University members to “get moving” in the expansion and called on other donors to join the effort.
“Things around Harvard move at a Harvard pace. That’s not glacially, but not exactly as I said the speed of the technology industry either,” Ballmer said. “There’s still a lot of money to be raised. I don’t want any buildings to be the constraint for the growth of computer science. Gotta move, gotta get Allston built.... This can’t be mañana, mañana, mañana.”
Still, on Wednesday, the notoriously energetic Ballmer could not contain his excitement, pounding the arm of an armchair for emphasis and jumping out of his seat in enthusiasm at least once.
“When I was a senior, they asked four of us to run the fundraising efforts for the class of ’77,” he said. “I’ve been on my class committee since 1977, continuous service. I’ve been a friend of Harvard since the day I graduated.”
It has been a busy year for Ballmer, who recently spent $2 billion to buy the Los Angeles Clippers basketball franchise, but this donation has long been in the works, he said Wednesday. Ballmer said that he met with University President Drew G. Faust and Harvard Corporation member James F. Rothenberg ’68 the day he retired from Microsoft this February. Ballmer came to Cambridge that same month at the invitation of Faust and Rothenberg, touring Allston with University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 and meeting with a number of faculty members.
Ballmer, who was a Crimson business editor during his time at Harvard, also had breakfast during the trip with Parkes. That meal, as well as a conversation with Murray, served as the primary impetus for the eventual gift, Ballmer said. He and Parkes agreed that the expansion aims to achieve “excellence in scale.”
“With quantity comes the ability to span new areas and not abandon all areas that are currently of interest,” Ballmer said. “I became convinced talking to David [Parkes] and Cherry [A. Murray] that scale was part of excellence. Harvard really did have the will and the determination, and Drew [Faust] had the will and determination.”
Ballmer added that even Maxwell Dworkin, the engineering building that he and Microsoft founder Bill Gates funded with a $25 million gift in 1996, is now overcrowded and dated, indicating the field’s rapid expansion.
“It is a little bizarre. It’s pretty new, and yet full and a little out of date,” Ballmer said of Maxwell Dworkin during Wednesday’s interview. “It’s just a huge demand whether it’s at Harvard or the rest of the nation that we’re seeing.”
“Steve’s energy in this challenge will really galvanize us to do what he has set forth, which is to deepen, widen, and grow the computer science department in ways that can make it a leader for Harvard and a leader in the world,” Faust said.
Harvard communications official Patrick S. McKiernan also attended the interview, which was granted on the condition that The Crimson not publish its contents until Nov. 13.

Students will vote on three referendum questions concerning course difficulty ratings, section size caps, and nap spaces in the Undergraduate Council presidential election next week.
Brett M. Biebelberg ’16, the Council's Rules Committee chair, confirmed that all three questions will be on the ballot when it opens for voting, though the exact wording of the questions may be modified after the Institute of Politics’ Harvard Public Opinion Project reviews them for neutrality.
Every semester, the Council allows students to submit questions to appear on the ballots of its regularly scheduled elections. Supporters of every potential question must garner 670 petition signatures for the question to make the ballot. If a majority of undergraduates cast their ballots in the election, the Council must accept the winning responses to referendum questions as its official stance.
The push to cap section sizes at 12 students has gained momentum in recent weeks, as more departments and committees continue to endorse the goal and the Harvard Teaching Campaign, the graduate student group behind the effort, began organizing an undergraduate wing to rally for support.
Although the Council endorsed the section size cap last spring, the UC required the Teaching Campaign to garner the necessary 670 signatures, rather than unilaterally pushing the question on the ballot. With the help of the UC’s education committee, organizers gathered about 1,400 signatures, more than two times the requirement, according to Biebelberg.
Last week, the Council approved automatically placing a question on whether the College should introduce student nap spaces to campus. At that time, the Council had already placed a question on the ballot about the Q Guide’s difficulty rating. The Faculty Council voted last fall to restrict student access to their peers’ responses to the difficulty-related question, prompting student outcry.
At least two potential questions failed to garner the requisite signatures or submit necessary documents in time. One involved making lab courses’ dissection requirements optional and the other called for reform of the UC’s structure.
Voting in the election will open online on Nov. 17 and run until Nov. 20 at noon.

Nearly 30 teaching fellows from across multiple academic disciplines shared their qualms about teaching for the Program in General Education at a town hall meeting Wednesday in Dudley House, the only meeting of its kind to help a committee charged with reviewing the program.
The meeting, which drew graduate students with varying levels of experience from departments as widespread as History and Astronomy, was the fifth in a series of town halls intended to gather feedback about Gen Ed from a variety of perspectives, according to committee chair and Philosophy professor Sean D. Kelly. The committee met with students four times during October and plans to meet with faculty members in similar meetings this semester.
Prompted by questions from Kelly and Maya R. Jasanoff ’96, a History professor and a member of the reviewing committee, TFs discussed the purpose of the current General Education program, section sizes, and TF assignment, among other topics.
The issue of section size in particular spurred heated discussion among the TFs, many of whom said they could not provide adequate feedback and time for students in sections of 18 or more students. TFs unanimously said that “a lot” would be solved if section sizes were smaller.
“Structurally, Gen Ed does not give me the opportunity to give these students the time they deserve,” said Taylor H. Cowdery, a doctoral candidate in the English department who has taught in departmental courses as well as in Gen Ed areas.
He added that unlike in the Program in General Education, department section sizes tend to be smaller, and level of interest among students tends to be greater.
Ryan Loomis, an Astronomy graduate student who teaches a course in the Science of the Physical Universe category of Gen Ed, agreed, suggesting that administrators lower the section size in Gen Ed courses before making other changes to see how that might improve the program.
“This is one place where it’s one change in one dimension,” he said. “You can use that as a scientific measure to see if this actually did change something.”
TFs also argued that having students with differing levels of background knowledge in these Gen Ed courses tended to exacerbate grade inflation and makes it difficult for the TFs to gauge at which level to teach their students.
Raymond W. Coderre III, an assistant dean for faculty affairs who helps facilitate the town hall style meetings, said that the undergraduate and TF meetings touched upon overlapping themes, like the purpose of the program and the level of difficulty in these courses.
Once the committee finishes a report on its findings in the spring, it will then give it to Dean of Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith for further review, according to Kelly. After Smith reviews it, he may then green-light the report for discussion among the faculty in the FAS.

Asian and Asian American students face unique mental health challenges as a byproduct of both ethnic stereotypes and cultural attitudes towards emotional vulnerability, panelists at the Harvard Graduate School of Education said Wednesday.
“We know that a disproportionate number of Asian Americans and Asians are impacted by mental illness and mental health,” said Josephine M. H. Kim, a professor at the Education School, in her opening remarks.
The panel discussion, sponsored by the Asian Coalition for Education, featured two students at the Education School, an alumna of the school, an associate professor of social research, and Ed K.S. Wang, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School who holds a board position on the National Asian American Pacific Islander Mental Health Association. Cindy Liu, director of multicultural research at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, moderated the discussion.
The event was part of “Fulfilling the Promise of Diversity,” a yearlong effort at GSE to conduct discussions about diversity. The audience, which included Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, filled the conference center at the Monroe C. Gutman Library.
The panelists discussed how a closer look at statistics indicates that Asians and Asian Americans have a particularly high rate of mental illness.
“Asian American girls have the highest depression rate [among ethnic groups],” said Hyeouk “Chris” Hahm, an associate professor of social research at Boston University.
Members of the panel shared their personal experiences with mental illness and how their Asian and Asian American identities influenced their recovery processes.
Sunny Zhang, a student at GSE, cited her father’s cultural standards as a precedent for dealing with emotional and mental vulnerability.
“For him, culturally, you don’t air dirty laundry,” she said. “You always put on your best face when you go out the door in the morning.”
This kind of veiling of difficult emotions is typical for those raised in Asian and Asian American households, said some of the panelists and event organizers.
“Asian Americans have a lot of mental health issues, but we have a hard time surfacing [these issues] for a variety of cultural reasons,” said Ivy Lee, a student who helped organize the event.
But the panelists said that an open dialogue about mental health issues will help combat the stigma all students affected by mental illness—Asian American or not—feel.
“Something is happening [where] we can actually openly talk about mental health and mental issues,” Wang said.

The Committee on Degrees in Social Studies will relocate to William James Hall from its current offices at the Student Organization Center at Hilles in the Radcliffe Quad.
The move will officially take place on Jan. 5, 2015, in preparation for the start of the spring semester.
Space became available in Williams James Hall after the Anthropology department moved out of the building and centralized its offices in the recently reopened Tozzer Library, according to Anya B. Bassett, director of undergraduate studies in Social Studies.
“We're excited to be closer to other social science programs, and we're excited that it will be easier for students to reach our offices,” Bassett wrote in an email.
Bassett wrote that the design of the new location provides gathering space for the concentration’s affiliates.
“Our new space includes a student-faculty lounge which, we hope, will be a place for our concentrators to stop by between classes. We also look forward to hosting social events for members of our community,” she wrote.
Students who dwell in the River Houses said they welcome the committee’s impending move.
“I love that we’re going to have somewhere to hang out in William James. The Social Studies staff is amazing—they’re what make Social Studies the best concentration at Harvard in my opinion. I’d love to be able to see the staff more easily,” said Zak P. Lutz '16, a Social Studies concentrator and peer concentration advisor.
The move to William James Hall will place the committee closer to many buildings where undergraduate classes are typically held.
“There is easier access to a variety of classrooms from the William James Hall area. That might be easier for the junior seminars and junior tutorials that Social Studies offers,” said Kevin Caffery, course director and lecturer on Social Studies.
While the move will make the committee’s offices more convenient for students living in River Houses, concentrators living in the Quad will now have farther to travel, Caffery said, adding that the relocation will not have a major effect on faculty members.
“I don’t think [the move] will bring any big impact in any real sense. I don’t think there will be a dramatic change,” he said.
Caffery also said he did not anticipate a dramatic change in the number of Social Studies concentrators, which he expects to "maintain itself for several years."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senior Wesley Saunders just wants you to know he cares. Understand where he has come from and you will come to believe him. You’ll also see why he never shows it.
Take the NCAA tournament game on March 22 against Michigan State, for example. Watch the highlights and look at Saunders walking to his bench as his teammates jump around. Spartans coach Tom Izzo has just called a timeout after his team’s lead was cut to two, but you wouldn’t be able to tell that from Saunders’ face.
Saunders registers another steal a couple minutes later and puts in a dunk. The game is tied. The crowd goes crazy. Former co-captain Oliver McNally ’12 goes even crazier. Saunders gives a Spartan a tap on the butt and heads back on defense.
Next, watch the postgame press conference (Saunders had 22 points in the 80-73 third round loss) and try to figure out if Saunders’ portion is from the season-ending game or a mid-February shootaround.
When ESPN ranked Saunders the 46th best collegiate player in the country, it described him as “[o]ne of those guys who always looks sleepy at tipoff.”
But step into the locker room and see if you can find that stone-faced machine. Good luck. Off the court, Saunders transforms. He’s a character—a goofy one.
“Wes and his jokes,” junior co-captain Siyani Chambers said.
Usually, the split is flipped: athletes are reserved off the field and emotional on it. Not Saunders. He’s managed to become the class of the Ivy League on the court while still being a class clown everywhere else.
Saunders says his demeanor stems from a simple phrase his mother drilled into him growing up.
***
Before we get to that, consider Saunders as a young player. He was a basketball purist long before he entered Harvard coach Tommy Amaker’s motion system.
“That’s not basketball,” he would yell at teammates messing around on the court.
Still, coaches questioned his attitude. Saunders never appeared to be giving maximum effort, and his mother, Ramona Robinson, got used to talking to them about it.
“OK, but he’s got the highest score, the most assists, and the most rebounds,” she remembered telling many of them. “People perceive it as him not putting the effort out, but the results speak for themselves.”
Actually, let’s quickly take another step back, to before Saunders ever picked up a basketball. He was already demonstrating a level head back then.
Robinson remembered her son responding unusually every time she told him “No.”
“[Children] are usually like, ‘Why not?’ [but] he would say, ‘OK,’ she recalled. “That used to shock me…. It’s just an interesting characteristic.”
At the same time, Saunders was demonstrating his physical ability. Whenever people came over to the house, they would invariably jump up to grab six-month-old Saunders as he got near the stairs, but the baby could already handle them adeptly. That motor coordination transferred to the court as Saunders grew up.
He was a good tennis player first, just like his mom. Robinson said Saunders spent the first four years of his life sitting on a tennis court watching his mother and older sister play. Then he joined local recreation leagues and eventually USTA tournaments.
Soon after Saunders discovered basketball, his tennis career was over, but he said his on-court demeanor is a carryover from his mother’s tennis lessons.“My mom always told me to never really let people see you sweat on the court,” Saunders explained. “I’ve always tried to maintain the same balance to never give somebody an advantage.”
The competitive streak has always been there, Saunders added. He just controls it.
Besides being sports-heavy, the Saunders’s family played a lot of board games growing up, with Wesley taking home most of the wins. Monopoly was his favorite, Robinson said, which might have to do with the fact that he almost never lost.
Even when the family advanced to Triopoly, a multi-level version of the game, Saunders handled the extra dimension and continued to dominate.
His dad still beats him in chess, though, Saunders said.
“It’s annoying,” he added after a pause.
But what about his off-the-court persona? Where does that come from?
***
Well, it’s tricky, but its roots can be seen in Saunders’ basketball game, too.
Anticipation—that’s what he says is the strength of his game—always knowing what’s coming next and how to take advantage of it. Others underestimating how calculating Saunders is adds to his effectiveness.
“I just lay back and act like you don’t know what’s up, but you are always one step ahead,” Saunders explained.
That’s where the misconceptions come from, perhaps.
“Everybody always jokes [that] I straddle the line between a genius and an idiot,” Saunders said.
Saunders is fine with others seeing his lack of emotions as a lack of attention. He just makes them pay. On the court, that means jumping passing lanes and taking advantage of lax defenders. Elsewhere, that mentality leads to his joking nature.
Saunders talked with Amaker last year about potentially becoming a captain, but the pair decided it would be better if Saunders focused on basketball. That meant he could keep his goofy locker room personality, too.
There are times when Saunders plays things too cool, like when he decided to stay up all night before the team’s trip to the Bahamas in 2011 only to be woken up by former assistant coach Yanni Hufnagel after dozing off at some point in the night.
But generally, Saunders is in control and ready to pounce at a moment’s notice, whether it looks like it or not. In the locker room, those moments come when players go to the bathroom. They have come to expect an occasional water bottle being dumped on their heads, courtesy of the prankster.
But they better get retribution against him fast, because once the game starts, that Saunders is gone.

When Harvard women’s basketball takes the court at Lavietes Pavilion on Nov. 15, it will be the first time in four years that the team will be without No. 22. Christine Clark ’14, who ended her senior season in fourth place on Harvard’s all-time scoring list, hung up her crimson and white jersey for the final time last spring, and now dons the blue and yellow of Lavezzini Parma in Italy’s Serie A1.
Losing Clark, a three-time All-Ivy League first team selection who averaged 16.5 points and 5.4 rebounds in conference play last year, leaves an obvious hole in the Crimson backcourt. With the loss of defensive specialist and fellow guard Jasmine Evans ’14 to graduation as well, the current guards on the Harvard roster will need to step into bigger roles this year.
“I think this is a very different team than last year,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “We graduated a very strong senior class, starting with Christine Clark. Jasmine Evans and Missy Mullins were also dominant in their defensive ability, so for us, we had to figure out how to fill those shoes.”
Leading this charge will be senior point guard Ali Curtis, who started alongside Clark last season, averaging 5.3 points and 2.4 assists per game over 24 minutes of action.
Curtis, who played the role of a game-managing point guard this past year, will likely be first in line to see an increased role in the backcourt as the only returning starting guard.
“Obviously, losing Christine Clark and Jasmine Evans, they were a major part of the backcourt both offensively and defensively [last year],” Curtis said. “It is my job as a senior and as a point guard to step up and assume that role. It is my responsibility to maintain the tempo of the game and to maintain the intensity.”
While the pressure may be on Curtis to lead the offense this campaign, fellow returning guard, junior Kit Metoyer, provided she remains healthy, will also likely receive more minutes this year along with an increased role in the offense.
Metoyer averaged 3.9 points per game last year in just 13.2 minutes a game and provided instant offense off the bench with her deep range from behind the arc, sometimes attempting treys from 30 feet out. Though Metoyer and Curtis are both considered point guards, expect them to share the court a fair bit in some versatile double point guard lineups that could see either player bringing up the rock or playing off the ball.
“I think Kit is both a great point guard and a great shooter,” Curtis said. “Kit and I are the only point guards at this point. As an offense, there are times that Kit and I will play together. It is a totally different system this year, so it is going to be interesting to see how it all works out.”
The loss of Clark coupled with the positional interchangeability of Curtis and Metoyer are not the only driving forces behind a revamped and more versatile offense for the Delaney-Smith-led Crimson, however.
Both point guards, two of the few guards left on the roster that have played heavy minutes for the Crimson previously, were sidelined with injuries for much of the summer and preseason.
While both are expected to be back to full strength by the start of the season, the injuries forced Delaney-Smith to experiment with new lineups, and gave extended minutes to other guards such as Shilpa Tummala, a junior who has been benched on-and-off during her first two years at Harvard with injuries herself.
“We have a lot of flexibility [in our backcourt],” Delaney-Smith said. “We started preseason with no point guard, so we have a lot of flexibility in our system. This is probably the deepest team I have had in a long time, and there are a lot of starting spots that are open right now.”
With possible lineups featuring two point guards and no point guards, the Crimson is counting on depth and versatility on the wing to make up for the offensive firepower and defensive steadiness that the Crimson lost with Clark and Evan’s graduation last spring.
With the likes of sophomores Maggie Hartman and Destiny Nunley, and the aforementioned Tummala, all returners who missed significant time last season due to injury, bolstering the wing alongside steady point guard play from Curtis and Metoyer, depth is certainly a strength of this year’s team.
“This team worked really hard in the preseason, as hard if not harder than any team I can remember,” Delaney-Smith said. “I am very pleased with [what I have seen out of] Shilpa, Destiny, and Maggie [this year].”

­“My legs are coming.”
Donning the familiar Harvard Hoops pinny, sophomore Corbin Miller said these four words to men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker. Miller had stopped Amaker after the final whistle of practice blew, and repeated the sentiment for emphasis.
My legs. They’re coming along.
Miller was in the final stages of a rehabilitation process of sorts, a seven-month conditioning drill in which, in Amaker’s words, the guard “broke down and built up” his body strength.
It was the third week of official practices, and, for Miller, the first time in three years that he was training for a full season of collegiate basketball. Miller, known on the team and around the Ivy League as a lethal shooter from deep, had spent the previous two years on a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He had taken a leave of absence from Harvard following his freshman year and spent close to 24 months training for and serving on his mission in various states in East-Central Mexico.
So while his team forged its way onto the national basketball scene, Miller was immersed in a culture that prized fútbol over free throws. And when, in an ironic twist of fate, Harvard drew Salt Lake City as its second-round destination for the 2013 NCAA Tournament—a location just 25 minutes from Miller’s hometown of Sandy, Utah—Miller was 2,056 miles away, leading a training session for other missionaries in San Lorenzo, Almecatla.
One year later, in March 2014, Miller’s flight home must have nearly crossed paths with the Crimson’s plane to Spokane, Wash. As his team prepared to play in its third consecutive NCAA Tournament on March 20, Miller ended his mission and flew back to Utah on March 19, timing that enabled him to watch his team upset the No. 5-seeded Cincinnati Bearcats in the second round of the Big Dance.
Now, as Harvard looks to win its fifth straight Ancient Eight crown, Miller is back on the hardwood alongside his teammates. The faces on the court beside him have changed as two years have come and gone, but, for Miller, the most important thing has stayed the same.
He was recruited to shoot. And that’s what he plans to do.
“A VITAL ROLE”
The average basketball jump shot is released at about a 45-degree angle, with just enough air under the ball to cushion it as it falls through the net. For Miller, however, 45 degrees just isn’t enough.
His shot is unconventional in the amount of arc he puts on every jumper. On a given play, Miller will swing the rock up to face level, hesitating for a split moment before cocking the ball back and releasing it in quick, successive motions. While the ball often starts off at knee level, with Miller’s arms extended—creating space in front of him—it nearly touches the bridge of his nose before he lets it go, a high-flying shot whose arc must be closer to 60 degrees than 45.
“His [form] is beautiful,” sophomore forward Zena Edosomwan said. “Watching him shoot—even when he misses, it’s pretty.”
“He just has a special ability to shoot the ball,” said Jeff Gardner, the current head basketball coach at Brighton High School, which Miller attended from 2007 through 2011.
During his freshman year with the Crimson, Miller shot a cool 45.6 percent from deep, knocking down 26 of the 57 three-pointers he attempted—a season-long conversion rate higher than any of those of Laurent Rivard ’14, Harvard’s all-time leader in three-pointers made in a year and in a career. Miller’s biggest moment as a rookie came in a conference win over Penn in which he carried the team with 17 points, stepping up when Rivard had a cold shooting night.
So with Rivard graduated, the logical step seems to be to pencil Miller into the lineup where Rivard was just one season ago. Even the national media—including the likes of NBC Sports and CBS Sports—have pegged Miller as the “replacement” sharpshooter, as Rivard 2.0.
But Miller doesn’t see it that way.
“Laurent was an incredible shooter, an incredible player…[and] I hope to be able to shoot it as well as Laurent,” Miller said. “But I think my game is a little bit different [than his], I take it off the dribble a bit more.”
Amaker echoed the sophomore’s sentiments, citing Miller’s ball-handling capabilities as a key difference between the two marksmen.
“[He’s] not going to be Laurent, though everyone [thinks so]—they’re just not the same player,” Amaker said. “Corbin can put the ball down, and he’s more of a true guard: he can do things off the dribble [and] can play point guard for us.”
While Rivard would often wait a foot or so behind the three-point line with his hands up, ready to catch and shoot, Miller has added to his repertoire a sharp dribble to his left or right, in an attempt to shake a defender and create a better look at the basket. And while Rivard rarely drove to the hoop, Miller’s ability to penetrate will enable him to create opportunities for others as well, finding them on the drive.
But Miller’s central asset for the team will be his ability to stretch the floor. With a stacked frontline as well as a talented pair of ball-handlers in senior wing Wesley Saunders and junior point guard and co-captain Siyani Chambers—whose strengths are most evident when they penetrate the paint—Miller’s shooting will force the defense to the perimeter, opening up the inside game for his teammates.
While just over two months ago Miller and Chambers had never met or spoken with one another, the guards have said that their transition to playing together has been seamless. And with the two most frequent recipients of Chambers’s perimeter swings—Rivard and Brandyn Curry ’14—graduated, Miller will likely step in as the go-to gunner receiving the junior’s bullet passes, a role that both Miller and Amaker say he is more than ready to take on.
“Corbin’s going to be a key guy,” Amaker explained. “We need him to be a terrific shooter. He’s going to play a vital role for our team, without a doubt.” “BUILDING BACK”
When Miller arrived back on U.S. soil in March 2014, he had barely picked up a basketball in almost two years and, according to Amaker, was 20 pounds lighter than he had been the last time he had stepped on the hardwood.
Miller’s roommate Nathan Wall, a linebacker on the football team who went on his mission at the same time as Miller, described just how difficult it is for athletes to keep their conditioning while on service trips. While they get 30 minutes to exercise every morning, there is no equipment to train with, rendering it difficult for them to maintain their body strength.
“You get out of shape really fast,” Wall explained.
So now, back on the floor of Lavietes Pavilion, Miller is working—every practice, every conditioning session—to get back into the rhythm he was in his freshman year, when he tallied those 17 points against Penn.
“He’s building back up,” Amaker said. “He’s worked hard to get to this point and so far so good.”
For Miller’s teammates, his marksmanship remains unquestioned. Despite the many months away from the court, his shot “looks exactly the same” according to co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi, and regaining his stroke has simply been a matter of “muscle memory” according to senior center Kenyatta Smith.
The main difference between the freshman of 2011 and the sophomore of 2014 is, instead, the leadership he gained when he stepped away from the gym and put the ball down, when Miller says he immersed himself in an attempt to “really just help people.”
“[I’ve had] a change in perspective,” he said. “I feel a lot more mature, a lot more comfortable playing, there’s an even more enhanced purpose to why I’m playing.”
With the start of the season right around the corner, Miller says he is back where he wants to be: steps away from the familiar red three-point arc on the Lavietes floor and ready to shoot that high-arcing jumper once more.
“I missed it—I missed it a lot,” Miller said. “I think [my mission] rekindled my fire and my hunger to come back and play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
High highs and low lows might be the right way to characterize the 2013-2014 Harvard women’s basketball season.
One day after snapping a four-year losing streak at Jadwin Gymnasium by defeating Princeton, 78-68, the squad played “one of the worst shooting games” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said she has ever seen, scoring just 38 points en route to a 29-point loss at Penn. High high, low low.
But the Crimson bounced back, and heading into late February, was tied atop conference standings, looking poised to take home the Ivy League title for the first time since 2008, with just the loss to the Quakers marring its resume. Then came the Penn-Princeton weekend at home.
This time, Harvard shot 30.8 percent against the Quakers, better than the 18.3 percent in Philly, but not good enough. The team lost, 63-50, ending a 21-game home winning streak. Though Harvard had already beaten the Tigers in Princeton’s home gym, repeating the effort was ultimately too much for the Crimson, which got its second loss of the weekend at Lavietes Pavilion.
Delaney-Smith’s team did receive an at-large bid to the Women’s National Invitational Tournament, at which it advanced past Iona on a buzzer-beating layup before falling to Rutgers in the second round.
The postseason run matched Harvard’s previous two outings in the WNIT, but this year’s hungry Harvard squad, driven by last season’s shortcomings, is ready to make another title run.
“I think that feeling of devastation, and that all of our hard work sort of took a turn for the worse on that [Penn-Princeton] weekend, is sort of a motivation,” said senior point guard Ali Curtis. “We all know how it feels to have everything taken away from us and we can’t do that again, we can’t drop two games in a row, we can’t let up. We can’t have that happen again.”
If Delaney-Smith’s new system works as the Crimson coach plans, there will be no déjà vu. Following the graduation of a strong senior class—including shooting guard Christine Clark ’14—the team has revamped its offensive and defensive strategies to implement transition-based schemes that will feature a more fast-paced, up-tempo style of basketball.
“We share the ball a whole lot in our new system right now,” Delaney-Smith said. “It’s a different offense that appears a little harder to scout.”
After ending last season tied for second with Princeton, the squad is ready to break the streak. Harvard last won the conference title in the 2007-2008 season, and the Crimson has come in second in the league every year since then.But if Harvard hopes to end its streak of second-place finishes, it will have to fight past the Killer P’s once again.
Princeton returns four of last year’s starters, including guard Blake Dietrick, who averaged 14.3 points per game and was named to the All-Ivy first team. Penn brings back Rookie of the Year guard Sydney Stipanovich, who scored 28 points over the two matchups against Harvard last year.
The Crimson will get a chance to avenge the losses when it takes on the Tigers and the Quakers in Cambridge at the end of January, but first it must get through a nonconference slate that features a matchup against preseason-No. 3 Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind., at the Basketball Hall of Fame Tournament.
“We are looking at our nonconference [schedule] as [though] we’re playing every game to win, and no matter who the opponent is,” Curtis said. “Even if it’s Notre Dame, we’re gonna have a chance, and we’re gonna crush them, that’s what we have to believe.”
With four talented freshmen, many of whom Delaney-Smith says will likely see significant playing time, a summer of training under its belt, and the new system implemented, Harvard may finally find its way back to March Madness.
“We have a motto of excellence, and I think it’s our challenge to sort of embody that in everything we do,” Curtis said. “If we’re able to do that, I think we’re going to do very well in the Ivy League.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four seniors may have graduated from the Harvard women’s basketball team and hung up their Crimson jerseys for good, but four rookies will have the chance to step into their spots during the 2014-2015 season.
To replace the departed group, Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith has brought in a class of four freshmen that includes a center who had 500 blocks in high school, a world-class rower, a four-time state champion, and a lock-down defender. On a team Delaney-Smith describes as the deepest she’s had in “a long time,” the rookies are expected to shoulder big roles for the Crimson this season.
“I’ve been really impressed with their class so far,” co-captain Kaitlyn Dinkins said. “They don’t really act like freshmen. Basketball-wise, they’re really mature and have stepped up to the level of some of the upperclassmen.”
The team, which finished tied with Princeton for second in the Ancient Eight in 2013-2014 season, was picked to finish third in this season’s Ivy League Preseason Media Poll, behind the Tigers and the Quakers—the defending conference champion. Harvard lost to Rutgers in the second round of last year’s Women’s National Invitational Tournament.
The freshman expected to make the most immediate impact for the Crimson is 6’4” Anna Lachenauer, a center from Weston, Mass. In practice, Lachenauer has been going up against senior Temi Fagbenle, the 6’4” All-Ivy first team forward expected to anchor the Crimson’s attack this year.
“This young freshman Anna is unstoppable,” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s just not playing like a freshman. She’s an incredibly hard worker, [and] she learns the game really quickly.”
Lachenauer, Milton Academy’s all-time leading shot blocker, nearly averaged a triple-double in her senior season, posting a stat line of 15.4 points, 11.6 rebounds, and 8.0 blocks per game. The center led her team to the semifinals of the New England Preparatory School Athletic Council Tournament and was named Independent School League MVP during her senior campaign.
According to co-captain Erin McDonnell, Lachenauer’s height and athleticism should put her in a position to be an elite collegiate defensive player.
“She is an unreal shot blocker,” McDonnell said. “She has long arms and very good timing for her blocks for practices. Especially because we have Temi, there’s a battle in the paint between those two at practice, which only makes [the] other better.”
Lachenauer joins a frontcourt featuring Fagbenle, McDonnell, and junior forward AnnMarie Healy, each of whom saw significant playing time last season. Joining the trio will be sophomores Maggie Hartman and Destiny Nunley, who both sat out last season due to injury.
Joining Lachenauer as another 6’4” newcomer to the Crimson frontcourt will be Maddy Tessier-Kay. Unlike her fellow recruits, Tessier-Kay was not necessarily known for basketball in high school.
Following her sophomore year at Conestoga High School, Tessier-Kay rowed for the Pioneers at the 2012 Henley Women’s Regatta, one of the world’s most prestigious rowing races, held annually on the River Thames in England.
“There was just something special about her potential,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think she is very agile and mobile for her height. She’s coming here with a little less experience than typical, and we just are astounded by how quickly she learns the game.”
While Tessier-Kay may be less polished than Lachenauer, the Harvard coaching staff and upperclassmen are excited to see the duo grow into Harvard’s frontcourt of the future.
Harvard’s other two freshmen, 6’1” wing Cameron Nieters and 6’1” guard Kirby Porter, are both currently sidelined with injuries but are expected to contribute when they return. Nieters, a Winston-Salem, N.C. native, was a four-time state champion at Bishop McGuinness Catholic High School and was invited to try out for the USA U16 National Team in 2011.
Porter hails from Chevy Chase, Md., and was recruited for her athleticism and aptitude on defense. Delaney-Smith envisions Porter developing into the team’s defensive stopper, taking on the role vacated by recently-graduated guard Jasmine Evans ’14.
This year’s freshmen are already making an impression on their teammates.
“Their class has become a part of our team a lot earlier than some of the other classes that I’ve experienced,” Dinkins said. “Our team is very close, both on and off the court, and so them being close with each other and therefore meshing with the team has allowed all of us to be very close [and to help the] unselfish team basketball that we play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­Harvard coach Tommy Amaker hates the word “expectations.” Expectations are synonymous with bluster, the outside noise that ramps up annually in mid-fall as Amaker’s team becomes an increasingly large national presence.
This kind of bluster is Cincinnati coach Mick Cronin noting—fresh off a 61-57 tournament loss to Amaker’s Crimson in March—that “if not for two slip-ups, you’re talking about a team that would have been 30-0.”
This kind of bluster is the Associated Press placing Harvard in its preseason Top 25 for the first time ever, right behind Michigan. This kind of bluster is ESPN ranking two members of the Crimson’s backcourt—senior Wesley Saunders and junior co-captain Siyani Chambers—amongst the top 50 players in the nation.
For most teams, the bluster shapes the narrative. For the Crimson, it is barely a footnote. The team’s internal word for expectations, as Amaker will gleefully interject, is standards.
“We are completely insistent on focusing on our internal standards and our identity,” Amaker said. “That’s what made us who we are, and there is no interest or feeling whatsoever [as to] who says we’re good, we’re bad, this or that.”
“When the season gets started, we block all that stuff out and get right to work,” Chambers added. “We’re not worrying about...what other people are saying.”
Instead, the Crimson refuses to let others shape its destiny. Talking to the team is an exercise in clichés, if only because the players have internalized Amaker’s self-belief. The indifference to public opinion is a manifestation of confidence; in their three Harvard seasons, this year’s seniors have only been blown out by 15 points or more three times in 93 games—if they say they can play with anyone, it’s because they have.
Sophomore forward Zena Edosomwan may as well have spoken for the team when he noted, “If I play hard consistently…everything will take care of itself.”
On the court, Edosomwan will be part of a deep and balanced Crimson front line that features co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi and senior Kenyatta Smith. Smith, who exploded down the stretch of the 2012-2013 campaign, will provide the interior defense the team lost with the graduation of Kyle Casey ’14. The depth is an embarrassment of riches; freshman Chris Egi may be the first backup four-star recruit in Ivy League history.
The frontcourt is deep, but the backcourt is top-heavy. In their third year playing together, Chambers and Saunders are expected to be the best backcourt in the conference, and potentially one of the best in the country. Only two other backcourts—Kentucky and Wichita State—had a duo ranked among ESPN’s Top 50 college players. It is hard to outshine the pair’s stat line of 25.3 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 8.4 assists per game.
Although they lead in different ways, both are instrumental to the team’s success.
“It’s a very unique dynamic,” Smith said. “Siyani is a more vocal general on the court and Wes leads more through his actions. It’s really good to have them both on the court because whenever we have slippage in one person, the other is there to help.”
Helping matters is the disarray of the rest of the conference. As the team starts its quest for a fifth straight Ivy League championship, the Ancient Eight is there for the taking.
After having lost guard T.J. Bray to graduation, Princeton is a shell of its former self. Columbia, the up-and-comer that pushed Harvard to double overtime in New York last winter, is wracked with injuries.
After the unexpected departure of guard Meiko Lyles, the Lions lost All-Ivy first-teamer Alex Rosenberg to a foot fracture in late October; when Rosenberg withdrew to preserve his eligibility, he took the team’s title hopes with him. Yale, the toughest foe on paper, has yet to shed its little brother label, having beaten Harvard just twice in the last eight matchups.
The cards appear to be in place, but Amaker is reserved. The departures of Casey, Laurent Rivard ’14, and Brandyn Curry ’14 leave the Crimson thinner in the backcourt. With the exception of Smith, the team has largely avoided injuries to its key players during its four-year run, but there is no guarantee that lasts.
It’s why Amaker has such disregard for expectations. A twisted ankle could change everything. A one-bid conference leaves the Crimson with little room for error. As a rival coach noted to ESPN’s Jeff Goodman, “[Harvard] barely won the league last season, and the same can be said the year before [sic].” The team’s status as the favorite comes with a target on its back; three straight outright championships comes with potential for complacency.
“Coming into this year, I was anxious to gauge the hunger of this team,” Amaker said. “One of the things that drove us last year was Kyle and Brandyn. They brought a hunger because they weren’t a part of the year before.”
Smith talks about the same thing—having a purpose and leaving an indelible mark on the program. As the Crimson tries to live up to its internal standards, Amaker stresses that the season will hinge on the team’s hunger.
“That senior class has to have a purpose about finishing off their careers in a way that’s unprecedented,” Amaker said. “I think if we bring those elements to this group with that kind of talent, I like where this team can go.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HARVARD
Having come in second in the league for the past six years, this Crimson squad is itching to return to the top. Though Harvard graduated its top scorer in guard Christine Clark ’14, the team welcomes four talented rookies and returns senior forward Temi Fagbenle, who averaged 13 points per game last season.
Player To Watch: Temi Fagbenle, senior forward
Fagbenle will be one of three 6’4” women on the Crimson’s squad, but the most experienced of the bunch.
BROWN
After finishing last season 4-10 in the Ivy League and 10-18 overall during longtime coach Jean Burr’s last season at the helm, the Bears will turn to first-year coach Sarah Behn. Behn has big shoes to fill, as Burr retired as the winningest coach in Brown women’s basketball history after 26 years. Senior guard Sophie Bikofsky should lead the Bears’ offense again this year.
Player To Watch: Sophie Bikofsky, senior guard
Bikofsky led the nation in shooting from deep last season and will be crucial to Brown’s offense again.
COLUMBIA
Columbia hasn’t had a winning record since the 2009-2010 season when the Lions went 18-10 overall. Last year was no different, as first-year coach Stephanie Glance led Columbia to a 6-22 record that saw the team go 3-11 in conference play. Columbia finished tied for sixth in the conference preseason poll with Dartmouth, despite returning many of its top players from a season ago.
Player To Watch: Tori Oliver, sophomore forward
Oliver should be featured heavily alongside senior guard Miwa Tachibana on this veteran squad.
CORNELL
The Big Red, which finished fifth in the conference last season, looks destined to remain in the middle of the pack again, as it was picked to return to that fifth-place spot in the preseason poll. Cornell lost its leading scorer and rebounder from last season to graduation in Allyson DiMagno, who led the team in scoring last season and was the first Big Red player to score over 1300 points and grab 900 rebounds for the program.
Player To Watch: Nia Marshall, sophomore forward
The Big Red will likely rely on Marshall, who was named Ivy Rookie of the Week five times last season.
DARTMOUTH
The Big Green look to improve upon last season’s finish at the bottom of the Ivy League and last season’s offense, which had the lowest scoring output conference wide. To do so, Dartmouth’s second-year coach Belle Koclanes will lean heavily on sophomore Fanni Szabo on the offensive side of the ball.
Player To Watch: Fanni Szabo, sophomore wing
Szabo put up 13.2 points per game last year as a rookie, good enough for eighth overall in the Ivy League.
PENN
The reigning Ancient Eight champion returns this season without guard Alyssa Baron, who averaged 14.9 points per game last year. But don’t count the Quakers out—they’ll be more than equipped to defend their title with center Sydney Stipanovich, the reigning Defensive Player of the Year and Rookie of the Year. Penn will have a chance to show off its talent early on with its season opener against No. 4 Tennessee.
Player To Watch: Sydney Stipanovich, sophomore center
The sophomore, who recorded 99 blocks last season, will be huge on both sides of the ball for Penn.
PRINCETON
After winning the Ivy League title every year since 2009, the Tigers conceded their crown to Penn last year. With four of five starters returning, Princeton should be in a good position to reclaim its familiar position atop the conference. The team tied with Penn for first in the media preseason poll and will likely rely on the play of top-scoring guards Blake Dietrick and Michelle Miller.
Player To Watch: Blake Dietrick, senior guard
Dietrick led Princeton’s long-range scoring attack, netting 40 percent of her trey attempts.
YALE
If Yale, picked fourth in the preseason poll—where the team finished last year—wants to crack into the top three, it’ll have to fare better in two three-game stretches that feature Harvard, Penn, and Princeton in consecutive games. The Bulldogs went 0-6 against the big three last year. This young Yale team will look to senior guard Sarah Halejian to make plays down the stretch.
Player To Watch: Sarah Halejian, senior guard
Last year’s Ivy leader in assists, Halejian will be Yale’s only senior on the team this season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HARVARD
Harvard is the unanimous favorite to win the Ivy League. Junior co-captain Siyani Chambers and reigning Ivy League Player of the Year Wesley Saunders are no longer stars—they are superstars. The dynamic backcourt is one of the most dangerous in the nation, and the return of senior center Kenyatta Smith will bring size to an already-loaded frontcourt. Ranked No. 25 in the AP preseason poll, the Crimson will surprise nobody this year as it looks poised to make a fourth straight NCAA Tournament appearance.
Player To Watch: Siyani Chambers, junior guard
Chambers is the team’s steadiest ballhandler on the floor and will take on a larger scoring role this year.
BROWN
After losing Sean McGonagill, the team’s starting point guard  and leading scorer at 17.4 points per game last year, Brown will rely on its stout defense in 2014-2015. Reigning conference defensive player of the year Cedric Kuakumensah anchors a tough, gritty Brown squad that will have a hard time creating offense without McGonagill running the point.
Player To Watch: Leland King, sophomore forward
For Brown to move into the league’s top half, King must build upon a noteworthy first season.
COLUMBIA
Only a couple of months ago, Columbia was the consensus sleeper pick to win the Ivy League. The Lions had all of the assets to make a run, with marksmen on the perimeters and size in the frontcourt. But things changed rapidly for Columbia when first-team All-Ivy senior forward Alex Rosenberg withdrew from school after injury, putting the Lions’ conference title hopes on hold for now.
Player To Watch: Maodo Lo, junior guard
With Rosenberg sidelined, Lo will need to take on leading scorer responsibilities for the Lions.
CORNELL
After going 2-26 last year and seeing leading scorer Nolan Cressler (16.8 ppg) transfer to Vanderbilt, there wasn’t much to be smiling about at the end of the season for Cornell. Nonetheless, there is a glimmer of hope for the Big Red: Shonn Miller. Miller missed the 2013-2014 season, but the senior forward and former first team All-Ivy selection can stuff the stat sheet (11.5 ppg, 6.8 rpg, 1.9 spg, 1.9 bpg in 2012-2013).
Player To Watch: Shonn Miller, senior forward
After a year off, the senior forward will do it all for the Big Red in 2014-2015.
DARTMOUTH
The return of three of last years’ four top scorers, including its leader, junior guard Alex Mitola, should provide some offensive balance for Dartmouth. Last season, Mitola torched Cornell for 33 points and went eight-for-nine from beyond the arc. Junior  Malik Gill is the other half of this speedy, feisty backcourt.
Player To Watch: Gabas Maldunas, senior forward
Maldunas comes back from injury as the centerpiece of Dartmouth’s dark horse conference title hopes.
PENN
There isn’t much about this Penn team that is reminiscent of a year ago. In fact, eight players from last year’s roster are no longer with the Quakers and six freshmen have joined the squad. Both of its senior captains, Cam Crocker and Patrick Lucas-Perry, were non-factors last season after suffering leg injuries that kept them off the court. As a result, a young Penn team has an opportunity to forge an entirely new identity in Philadelphia.
Player To Watch: Tony Hicks, junior guard
With the departure of Miles Cartwright, Hicks will need to be a leader for this young Penn squad.
PRINCETON
It seems that every year, Princeton loses another star player. After the graduation of star forward Ian Hummer two years ago, the Tigers suffered the biggest loss in the Ivy League this year with the departure of guard T.J. Bray. The unanimous first-team All-Ivy selection from last year did everything for the Tigers, meaning that Princeton’s success this year will hinge on being able to replace his production.
Player To Watch: Spencer Weicz, senior guard
The Tigers have a large void to fill with Bray’s departure, making Weisz a smart breakout candidate.
YALE
The Bulldogs boast arguably the best big man in the Ancient Eight in sophomore forward Justin Sears. Sears, a first-team All-Ivy selection, led the Bulldogs in scoring with 16.9 points and 6.8 rebounds per game last year. Those numbers should only go up. Yale will return seven of its top eight scorers, including captain Greg Kelley, who can spread the floor with his three-point shooting ability.
Player To Watch: Justin Sears, junior forward
A year after bursting onto the scene, Sears should be a strong contender for Ivy League Player of the Year.

Preseason is almost over, jump shots and free throws have been perfected, and set pieces have been practiced rigorously. The Harvard women’s basketball team is ready to play ball.
For the returning players, this Saturday will represent their first chance to demonstrate how much they have improved since last year. For the new players, it is a dream finally being realized.
“Our expectation is to achieve excellence in every practice and every game,” co-captain Kaitlyn Dinkins said. “This means pushing each other in practice and maintaining a championship level of discipline in everything we do. We have a challenging nonconference schedule which will prepare us for winning an Ivy League championship.”
The team will face Colgate in its season opener at Lavietes Pavilion. Harvard looks to build on last year’s successful season, where it reached the second round of the WNIT before falling to Rutgers, 63-52.
“We’ve definitely grown in our own personal accountability and taking practice to the next level, which helps us in games,” Dinkins said. “Every day in practice is all-out competition.”
Not only are both teams seeking to start off their seasons on the right foot, but they also have the pressure that comes with a sibling rivalry. Saturday’s game will be the second time that Harvard senior point guard Ali Curtis and her younger sister Katie, Colgate’s sophomore guard, face off.
Last year, the elder sister’s team was the victor, so the younger will now have her chance for revenge.
“There is definitely some smack talk between those two point guards,” co-captain Erin McDonnell said.
The two teams have a short history, with last year representing their first meeting since the 2005-2006 season. The Crimson previously captured both meetings in 2001 and 2002, and it will look to keep the streak alive on Saturday.
When the two squads faced off last season, Harvard’s Christine Clark ’14 and Colgate’s Lauryn Kobiela dominated the game with 21 and 27 points, respectively. Clark’s efforts helped the Crimson take the lead early in the game. Though the Raiders were able to trim the deficit multiple times, the Crimson held onto its lead for the entire game before emerging victorious, 91-76, in Hamilton, N.Y.
With the win last season over Colgate, Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith joined the group of 28 other active Division I coaches with 500 or more career wins.
“We don’t look in terms of what we want to improve on, because we have a different team, different personnel,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think we’re going to look a lot different.”
That difference will come from losing four players, including its top scorer for the past few years in Clark. The recent graduate, who now plays professionally overseas, is the fourth highest all-time Harvard scorer.
“We lost great seniors who were threats offensively and defensively,” McDonnell said. “Having said that, this presents opportunities for our underclassmen to step up and contribute.”
The Crimson enters the season with four new freshmen: center Anna Lachenauer, point guard Kirby Porter, forward Maddy Tessier-Kay, and forward Cameron Nieters.
“The freshmen have transitioned extremely well into our system because of their high court IQ,” McDonnell said. “They add a lot of size and athleticism to our team, and we are confident in their hard work this past preseason.”
“I think we have great height, so we want to be a consistently dominant rebounding team,” Delaney-Smith added.
Colgate has also lost three of its most valuable players to graduation, most notably Kobiela, who led the team with assists with 131 last season.
Though this matchup will not have implications for the Ivy title, it will give the squad its first shot at working out any kinks in Delaney-Smith’s system.
“We’re really focusing on our team tightening up or defense and focusing on things we need to work on,” Dinkins said. “We’ll go over some of their stuff, but it’s really about us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Yale skates onto the ice of the Bright-Landry Hockey Center, there is always an intense aura in the air. But this time around, the Harvard men’s ice hockey team may skate with even more of an edge.
Last March, the Bulldogs ended the Crimson’s 2013-2014 campaign with a two-game sweep in the first round of the ECAC tournament. At home this weekend, Harvard has a chance to strike back on Saturday after hosting Brown on Friday.
“There’s still definitely a sour taste in our mouth from last year,” junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo said. “Regardless, when you’re playing Yale and you’re playing for Harvard, there’s always going to be a chip on your shoulder. You’re definitely going to want to come out strong against those guys.”
Coming off a 6-3 win on Tuesday against No. 8 Boston College (4-5-0, 1-3-0 HEA), Harvard enters the weekend with confidence. With four conference points up for grabs, the early season match-ups could go a long way in determining the team’s postseason seed.
“These games are some of the biggest of the year, especially early on,” Criscuolo said. “You realize at the end of the season, every point really matters in the ECAC standings.”
The Crimson (2-0-2, 1-0-2 ECAC) aims to build on early momentum. Only two other Division I teams—No. 5 Michigan Tech (8-0, 6-0 WCHA) and No. 17 Robert Morris (7-0-1, 5-0-1 AH)—have yet to lose a game in 2014.
“We had a lot of confidence and momentum throughout preseason,” senior forward Tommy O’Regan said. “There’s been a really good atmosphere and a really good attitude over the last few months. That’s definitely contributed to the success we’ve been having.”
On Friday, Harvard will have to contend with its conference’s top-rated recruiting class. Brown (1-2-0, 0-2-0) brings in three drafted freshman forwards in Sam Lafferty, Max Willman, and Tyler Bird. The trio has already made an impact, combining for three points in the Bears’ 4-2 win over Army on Oct. 31.
Harvard will return to the rink on Saturday to face Yale (1-1-2, 0-1-1), which won the national title in 2013. While he wasn’t on the national championship team, sophomore forward John Hayden has been one of the Bulldogs’ most consistent offensive threats this season and was particularly effective against the Crimson in last year’s conference tournament.
“We’re just going to stick to our game plan,” O’Regan said. “There’s been a lot of energy and everyone’s been executing really well. We just keep playing the way we are and have the natural passing that we do against teams like Yale and Brown, [and] then we should be all right.”
Not only does the game mark another meeting of the two rival teams, this Saturday represents the first presentation of the Tim Taylor Cup, an award given to the most outstanding player of the Harvard-Yale men’s hockey game. The award is named for the late Tim Taylor, a Harvard hockey alumnus and longtime Yale coach who died from cancer in 2013.
In addition to the individual teams, rivalries, and traditions, another challenge facing the Crimson lies in having to play two conference games back-to-back.
“[We have to] focus on one game at a time,” Criscuolo said. “Hopefully we play well on Friday so we can take that into Saturday.”
Through four games, Harvard has featured a talented top line and a perfect penalty kill.
“There haven’t been many flaws,” O’Regan said. “All the freshmen and the older guys are continuing to get better and better. The strength’s been the consistency of everyone.”
Even with the team’s hot start, the Crimson continues to focus on improving as a unit.
“We need to keep working on being able to play well while we have a lead,” Criscuolo said. “That’s something we’re definitely going to work on heading into the weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the past decade, no women’s volleyball team in the Ivy League has won the conference championship with more than two Ancient Eight losses. So, when the Harvard women’s volleyball team fell to 1-2 in conference play after a straight-set loss to Brown on Oct. 4, odds at making a run for the title looked bleak. There was seemingly only one option if the team wanted to accomplish its goal of claiming the league: win out.
And that’s just what the Crimson has done thus far.
Riding a nine-game winning streak, Harvard (17-4, 10-2 Ivy) enters this weekend tied with Yale atop the Ancient Eight standings with home games against Columbia and Cornell to round out the regular season schedule. With victories over the Lions and Big Red, the Crimson guarantees at least a one-game playoff with Yale and perhaps, with a Bulldogs loss, outright possession of the Ivy League throne.
“Our entire season comes down to these last two games,” junior libero Sindhu Vegesena said. “After…going to five with both Princeton and Penn, we understand now more than ever that a few points in the fifth set can make or break us.”
While Harvard has been on top of its game over the past five weeks, Columbia (7-14, 3-9) finds itself trending in the opposite direction. After a 3-1 start on the season, the Lions have lost their last eight, including a 3-2 defeat to the Crimson to begin the streak.
Despite the lack of recent success, the Lions still trot out one of the best attackers in the Ivy League in junior outside hitter Bailey Springer. The junior ranks third in the conference in kills per set with 3.4. Fellow junior Katarina Jovicic headlines the defense for Columbia, leading the Ancient Eight with 1.09 blocks per set.
The Crimson hopes its balanced attack will break through the defense of Jovicic and others. The Harvard offense is led by two of the four most efficient attackers in the league in junior Caroline Holte and co-captain Caroline Walters, who ranks first in the Ivy League with a .41 kill percentage.
“Across the board [Ivy League] teams have the talent and volleyball IQ,” Vegesena said. “But the team that comes out on top is the one that wants it more. And that’s been our defining advantage this season.”
While upperclassmen have dominated playing time this year, Crimson freshman Paige Kebe was the star of the night in the season’s first matchup between the squads. Kebe recorded a team-high 22 kills, her first and only time cracking double-digits since her arrival on campus this year.
Cornell (5-17, 2-10) will also enter Cambridge on a losing streak, albeit one of a lesser magnitude, three games. In the team’s last three contests against Penn, Princeton, and Yale, the Big Red has only won one set.
But Cornell still poses a threat to Harvard’s title hopes. In her first year with the team, freshman Maddy Sroufe ranks among the top ten in the Ivy League in kills per set with 2.9. The Big Red also sends out senior libero Natasha Rowland, who leads the conference with 5.5 digs per set.
The Crimson managed to dispel the Big Red in quick fashion earlier this season in Ithaca, defeating Cornell in straight sets. Sophomore Corinne Bain was the only player to record double-digit kills in the game with 11 of the 37 total for Harvard. Freshman Emily Wemhoff led the Lions with eight kills.
Despite the combined 11-game losing streak that the two New York teams bring to Cambridge this weekend, the message for Harvard remains the same: one game at a time.
“It’s easy to get overwhelmed by the idea of winning the Ivy League title,” junior Caroline Holte said. “Keeping [our mentality] in one point and one game increments…is what is going to be most important for us going forward.”

Sophomores are finally breathing a sigh of relief now they have officially declared their concentrations and have completed their Plan of Study. This endeavour not only means that students must choose a course of study that will affect the rest of their college career and ultimately their life, but also that they must navigate the most confusing website ever in order to do so.
Filling out the notoriously clunky worksheet, which even comes with its own video tutorial, is one of the great struggles of a Harvard student. Here are seven things that are easier, more intuitive, and less time consuming to do than filling out the Plan of Study.
1. Keeping a dorm room clean It may be hard with all the running around Harvard students do, but doing laundry, organizing your room and common room, and taking out the trash is kind of manageable (kind of).
2. Catching the Harvard Square Turkey This is much easier said than done: wild turkeys are not very friendly. And who knows what diseases they carry!
3. Running a marathonMonths of preparation for 26.2 miles of happiness, and only four hours of pain! At least you get to look at the entertaining signs to cheer you on.
4. Finding Atlantis No, not the Bahamian getaway, the fabled underwater island. If it helps, it's rumored to be somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
5. Getting Kanye West to smileIs it physically possible for him to smile in front of a camera? What is behind that stony glare? Perhaps he’s cooking up his next album and does not want to betray himself via his facial expressions. Maybe he saves all of his smiles for Kim (#allday).
6. Convincing Jessica Simpson that Chicken of the Sea is, in fact, tunaShe could argue false advertising, but everyone (except her) knows it's tuna.
7. Applying and getting into YaleRemember the age old saying? The only thing that Yale and Harvard students have in common is that they were both admitted to Yale.

1) Eye candy: Taylor Swift’s new music video, “Blank Space,” features a gorgeous Tswift in beautiful gowns, a ridiculously good-looking mystery man, and only the prettiest mansion ever.
2) Convo starter: Stuck in a mildly awkward lunch date with nothing to say? “Stillman Infirmary” and “attendance survey” seem to be buzzwords….
3) Sugar rush/cute way of asking someone out casually: Starbucks is bringing back its “Buy one holiday drink, get one free” offer between 2 to 5 p.m. from now until Sunday. Yay for 60 grams of sugar in one sitting!

2) Are Taylor Swift and Spotify Never, Ever, Ever Getting Back Together?: Tswift is really abusing our unconditional love for her by making us actually *buy* music.
IN THE NEWS
1) Computer Science Faculty To Increase by 50 Percent with Ballmer Gift: “Harvard’s computer science faculty will grow by 50 percent, or 12 professorships, following a gift from former Microsoft CEO Steven A. Ballmer ’77. Ballmer did not specify the size of the gift.”
2) Undergrad Ed Group Debates Accessibility of Q Difficulty Scores: “Students, faculty, and administrators debated how to improve the Q Guide’s difficulty rating, an online metric on Harvard’s course evaluation tool that has been a recent source of tension between students and administrators, at the semester’s final Committee on Undergraduate Education meeting on Wednesday.”
3) Committee on Study of Religion Endorses Section Cap: “The Committee on the Study of Religion endorsed a 12-student cap on section sizes Tuesday, becoming the sixth department or committee to extend its support of the Harvard Teaching Campaign, a group of teaching fellows and students calling for smaller sections.”
4) Bol Notifies Students Affected by Controversial Attendance Study: “Vice Provost for Advances in Learning Peter K. Bol, who authorized a now-controversial lecture attendance study that involved photographing students without their knowledge last spring, notified the students who took the affected courses by email on Wednesday.”

In case you missed it, Harvard University Health Services is planning to shutter the Stillman Infirmary, ending its overnight services beginning next semester. Stillman is perhaps better known as the place you’ve had to bring your out-of-control roommate at least once (or maybe the place you’ve woken up a couple Sunday mornings, too). While the university is in the business of closing seemingly essential services in order to improve efficiency, here are some other things they might do away with:
The YardThe Yard is everything that is wrong with Harvard—it’s full of old, historical buildings and is constantly swarmed by a mixture of tourists and freshman. It’s really just a glorified shortcut between the Houses and classes. Who needs it?
LamontIf relocating all of Lamont’s books and other resources is too costly, maybe instead they should just reduce Lamont’s Monday-Thursday hours to 8am to 10pm, and offer overnight phone consultations instead.
The D-hallsIf your hunger is that much of an emergency, you can go eat somewhere where you pay for it. But honestly, how much do students really need to eat? Most of them don’t even finish their plates every night, so they must not need food at all.
StudentsIf there is one threat to university efficiency, it is definitely students. We come here and live in University housing, eat University food, and take up the precious office hours of University professors. If the school really wants to restructure and save some dough, it should really just get rid of students.
The Amnesty PolicyOh wait, closing Stillman means they’re already halfway there.
