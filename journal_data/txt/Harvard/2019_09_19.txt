After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hating Harvard is not discouraged, not questioned, but embraced. Standing in a dining hall inevitably means overhearing something along the lines of “Why does the College do this?” “Why don’t they put endowment money to good use?” and the like. As former Undergraduate Council President Rohit Chopra ’04 put it in 2003, we “love to hate Harvard.” We run on the fumes of communal commiseration.
And why do we hate? The perennial arguments include legacy status, social exclusivity, general inequality, and excessive competitive pressure. Hating Harvard is a vehicle for changing these “inequalities;” or at least that is what many students would have us believe.
So how have we fared? The results are certainly mixed and certainly up to individual interpretation. Many, for example, would argue that the sanctioning of single-gender organizations was a great social equalizer on campus. Others, however, see this step as highly detrimental for female spaces while others protest the infringement of their so-called right to assemble as they choose. And in the end, final clubs persist while former fraternities and sororities slip through loopholes. The only major change seems to be increased frustration toward the College.
When I applied to Harvard, I was told horror story upon horror story from jaded students. My impression was that perhaps this journey would not be worth it. Perhaps my sanity was more valuable. Perhaps a more accepting space and a more collaborative environment would be preferable. So the day I got my acceptance, it was with a heavy heart that I submitted my confirmation. Looking back, I feel ungrateful. But most of all, I fell right into the trap: the trap of communal hate.
I believe that on the surface, many students are so needlessly critical of their Harvard experience that they are ungrateful. Ungratefulness is something we have all fallen prey to time and time again. There’s no need to emphasize the academic preeminence of the institution, but sometimes we forget how extraordinary this place is. The summer before my freshman year, I was met with the news that more than half of my class would be non-white. More than half — the most diverse class in 380 years of Harvard. As for wealth inequality, more than half of the graduating class of 2017 was earning at least $70,000 in their upcoming jobs. No — not all Harvard students come in with the same — but many leave with substantial earnings in sight.
As a junior, my Harvard experience has had its shares of highs and lows, but has constantly been a journey of growth, and a positive one at that. Have I met snobby students? Have I been denied access to certain spaces on a seemingly arbitrary basis? Have I witnessed inequality of opportunity on the basis of race, sexual orientation, and socio-economic background? And finally, have I been stressed out of my mind? Yes, yes, yes, and yes.
But while these lows persist and will always persist anywhere in an imperfect world, I have also seen a much brighter alternative. I go to school in one of the most diverse institutions on earth. I hear from the greatest minds in and out of the classroom. And I am supported by some of the most intelligent and charismatic friends. How can I hate such a place?
Yes, I have been challenged. And yes, I have experienced College-wide changes that regularly perplex and frustrate me. But for every frustration, I attend various lectures with world-renowned professors. For every mistake the College makes, I see a tenfold effort at rectifying and addressing injustices. Most of all, for every administrative shortcoming, I see students leaping at the chance to fill in the gaps. Watching the intelligent, dynamic friends we have at Harvard excel as leaders, addressing the issues that matter to them, is likely one of the greatest joys the institution grants its students. And yes, it is cliché, but most clichés are true.
Perhaps the hatred we often share is a product of the privilege we have. Many have grown far too used to the singular experiences at Harvard. Where else can we express ourselves this way? Will your investment bank allow you to openly insult its CEO? Presumably not.
On a more practical note, like my dad always says, “You’ll never have it this good again.” The proverbial “real world” is not this diverse in the workplace nor is it as socially conscious. Nor does it have oodles of money to spend on travel and research or a myriad of renown speakers visiting campus. Harvard is flawed, but Harvard is also special.
I extend this challenge to Harvard students: Be critical in a grateful way. By this I mean eliciting change from a place of love — love of learning, love of school, and love of each other.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It seems as if the Harvard administration has a solution for every problem.
The General Education program was “failing on a variety of fronts”? The joint concentration program has “concerns”? Shopping week is too complicated and removing it would improve the “academic experience” of students? Never fear — for Harvard’s administrators are here, ready to institute a solution or convene a committee to fix seemingly any problem at hand, even if it involves massive, wide-ranging changes which aren’t always successful.
We saw how many such changes simultaneously inconvenienced the College during this term’s shopping week, during which students had to balance a new Gen Ed system, course caps which frustrated students and instructors alike, an incredibly inefficient and byzantine lottery system, and an improved yet inaccessible my.harvard. Add to that the overhaul of the Bureau of Study Counsel and a new, but flawed direction for the freshman advising program, and it doesn’t take long to wonder how so much led by so few went so wrong.
After years of debate and discussion meant to ease the transition to the new Gen Ed system, and to consider the best way to roll the program out — including a year-long deferral — the frustrations surrounding this shopping week prove it all a spectacular mess.
And it’s not as if we haven’t seen this story before. Last year, after similarly interminable debate, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences debuted a new course schedule, which removed our celebrated seven-minute Harvard Time — alongside many students’ lunch hours.
Now, it’s apparent that any one committee or office or person isn’t entirely to blame for all this mess. The College has an Office of Undergraduate Education, an Advising Programs Office, a Program in General Education, and many other obscure groups besides who ultimately decided how to implement the litany of changes I’ve listed. And FAS itself, in conjunction with various deans, ultimately has the final say on larger matters like course schedules and shopping week.
Yet it really makes you wonder — how are Harvard’s brightest minds able to ineffectively institute their own policies? If anything, it only proves the late and great Yalie commentator William F. Buckley Jr.’s point that he’d rather have been governed by the first 2,000 people in the phone book than by the Harvard faculty. When the latter’s taking away my lunch hour, I’ll gladly take the former.
It’s all a double-edged sword. On one hand, Harvard is an incredibly large institution, with multiple schools and faculties and student and affiliate populations. As an institutionalist, I have to respect the complex — if confusing — machinery that makes this place run on a daily basis. Yes, we have multiple deans and offices and liaisons to administer to everything, even if it is so complex that I can’t say I know a single individual in the Dean of Students’ Office, for instance — a point I find particularly ironic as a student. And I do believe that in the end, everyone has the University’s best interests at heart — even if we all disagree over how to arrive there.
On the other hand, students, such as the Editorial Board I am a part of, regularly ask for specific administrative solutions to remedy Harvard’s biggest problems, and usually requesting the creation of committees or forums or investigations to solve whatever problem is at hand. After all, change, especially on large scales, must often necessarily be slow and not always linear. For critical issues such as the Gen Ed program, or shopping week, or even the role of social organizations on campus, it’s important to properly consider ideas and hold substantive debate before making decisions, particularly the impactful ones I’ve mentioned.
But that shouldn’t mean those decisions can’t be efficient and effective once rolled out, especially if there’s a year-long deferral for them. How is it that some faculty members were left just as confused and helpless as their students during this shopping week with respect to who could enroll in their courses, when the faculty voted for the changes to Gen Ed in the first place?
I understand many new policies are well-intentioned, especially with regards to the student experience. But we all know where good intentions lead, and I wouldn’t say many new policies meant to improve student life have been all that successful. Take Community Night, which has prevented me from eating at Adams House on Thursdays when I have a late class and am unable to return to my own House in the Quad, or the Gen Ed program, which I fiercely criticized in its earlier form and which I fiercely criticize now (if for different reasons).
It seems we just can’t accept the status quo, or at least the administration can’t, as many things seem to be changed for the sake of change. I’m sure it’s only a matter of time until this newspaper’s pages report the creation of a new Dean of Deans to resolve all of these messes. (Let’s face it, though: Who wouldn’t want that title?)

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a statement to Harvard affiliates last week, University President Lawrence S. Bacow addressed the University’s ties to deceased convicted sex offender Jeffrey E. Epstein. Stating he “profoundly regret[s] Harvard’s past association” with the disgraced donor, Bacow pledged to donate the sum of Epstein’s donations not yet spent by the University to charities that support victims of sex trafficking and sexual violence.
We applaud Bacow for this response. Following MIT’s lead in donating the remaining sum of Epstein’s donations was the moral thing to do, as we’ve opined previously, despite how small this sum may be in comparison to the total Harvard received. In articulating his response to Harvard’s ties to Epstein, Bacow’s leadership has notably exceeded the very low bar set by MIT’s president, L. Rafael Reif.
Reif’s dissembling statements — claiming he did “not recall” signing a thank you letter addressed to Epstein for gifts awarded to MIT well after Epstein’s 2008 conviction — and the intense backlash they have spurred highlight how vital clear, honest communication can be in navigating situations such as this one. We therefore appreciate Bacow’s efforts to reckon with the heinous nature of Epstein’s crimes and the troubling extent of his relationship with Harvard.
While we appreciate Bacow’s actions now, it bears mentioning that there is no reason such a statement couldn’t have been released in 2008, when Epstein pleaded guilty to procuring prostitution from underage girls. This was just as despicable and just as widely known then as it is now. While we recognize Bacow is not personally responsible for a decision made at a time he was not the president of Harvard, the fact that the University did not address its association with Epstein until 11 years after this conviction — allowing Epstein to continue to tout his ties to Harvard throughout this time — is hugely disappointing. We hope individuals in key positions of power, including Bacow, take this opportunity to reflect on the processes that led to the University’s more than decade long, and that, in the future, the University move more quickly to clarify its moral stance on similar issues.
Going forward, we are curious to see how this precedent of donating money from disgraced donors will inform similar future circumstances. Epstein is not the first character to raise concerns over the ethics of University donations. Mothers of opioid victims, local demonstrators, and various Massachusetts-based opioid grief groups have called for the refusal of donations from the Sackler family for the role some say the family played in spurring the nationwide opioid crisis. Bacow has said that it would be “inappropriate” for Harvard to return any past donations from the family. He has also made a point of noting that donating the remainder of Epstein’s gifts was an “unusual step for the University.” Still, it has been done. This begs the question: What is the coherent logical and moral distinction between these two cases?
Bacow has stated he is initiating a review of the process by which potential University donors are vetted, to ideally prevent having to address questions like this in the future. We’re hopeful that this review will lead to meaningful change. At least in this case, the University has fittingly, and finally, responded. We hope administrators draw a lesson from this incident and act more decisively in the future.

Like many life-altering moments, this one was born out of deep boredom. Summer in Taiwan was sweltering, and ample hours of free time were beginning to weigh on the shoulders of Joshua Y. Chiang ’22. Opening his phone, he began a new chapter.
Chiang is a sophomore who has rapidly accumulated close to 5,000 followers on the video sharing app TikTok. On his profile, you’ll find an array of hyper-emotive selfie-camera videos, filled with self-deprecating humor and overtly collegiate content. His bio describes him as a “14th grader at Harvard.”
Return to TikTok’s home screen and you’ll find a page called “For You” with an infinite scroll of short videos to scratch the procrastination-itch that sent you here in the first place. The selection is determined by an algorithm that, like most social media algorithms, privileges content that gets viewed over and over again, shared and liked and showered with comments. Generally speaking, this type of content skews slapstick, shock-provoking and plainly weird.
Scrolling through TikTok, I feel like I’m on a rickety wooden roller-coaster built too many decades ago. I didn’t realize I could be overstimulated in under 10 seconds. There are middle schoolers gyrating to Lizzo. A man with a bandana ranting about Margaret Thatcher. The eboys and egirls, semi-goth Internet personas whose aesthetics dovetail “random” 90s nostalgia and blasé Gen Z malaise. A grandma drumming on her granddaughter’s Lululemon-encased ass.
In a national culture so devoid of inherent meaning, so absurd and referential, the rising tide of eboys, lightning-fast nonsensical skits, and endless lip sync videos almost feels inevitable.
And apparently this entertainment grab bag called TikTok, delivered at YouTube-compilation-friendly whiplash speed, is a great lingua franca if you need to relate to kids.
“If you go to a middle school or maybe a high school and reference a famous TikTok, a lot of people would know the reference,” Luca M. Hinrichs ’22, a TikTok consumer, tells me. Hinrichs compares TikTok to Vine, the defunct 6-second video platform that fostered millions of instant inside jokes among youngsters from 2013 to 2016. “It’s kind of a social thing.”
TikTok was developed by Beijing-based startup ByteDance in an effort to market a version of the Chinese app Douyin to other countries. Maintaining two different versions of the same app has allowed the company to become “borderless,” fostering content outside the regulation of the Chinese government.
A huge chunk of this content is lip sync videos. ByteDance bought DIY music video app musical.ly in 2017 as part of its foray into the western social media sphere. (It later attempted to buy a big stake in Reddit, too.) Since the musical.ly acquisition, TikTok has skyrocketed in popularity, with downloads rivaling apps like Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Messenger. And, in the wake of Vine’s demise, the niche for a short comedic video platform was once again filled.
TikTok has come under scrutiny for its influence on children. Earlier this year, the FTC required that it pay a $5.7 million fine for violating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, which requires children under the age of 13 to gain parental consent before handing over their personal information to online services. In India, home to a whopping 25 percent of TikTok users, the app was briefly banned for facilitating “cultural degradation” among the youth. Despite these controversies, the app continues to create spaces for young people to make things, even if they’re just 10-second comedy skits or choreographed lip sync videos. The ban in India lasted all of two days.
TikTok users are overwhelmingly young — only a third are older than 30. It seems that kids can sniff out the next viral cultural phenomenon better than anyone.
SO YOU THINK YOU CAN BE A TIKTOK AMBASSADOR?
Evidently, the teenyboppers are not sufficient: TikTok has taken to college campuses in an attempt to expand its user base and suture its presence into the fabric of pop culture.
TikTok seeks to hire social butterflies with marketing experience, creative instinct, and, ideally, followers, “to help build awareness for TikTok” as campus ambassadors. “This isn’t about just handing out swag,” continues the job description, “it’s about bringing TikTok’s message to other students on your campus in fun and creative ways.”
The listing for Harvard’s position is down, and Chiang is bummed. He would have liked to apply.
He says he imagines the future of the app to hold more comedy-oriented content. “A lot of young people got famous on musical.ly, so now this [lip syncing children] is the reputation [TikTok] has,” he says. “I think having campus reps, who can potentially make funny videos to spread around, could change that reputation.”
Perusing the #harvard content wormhole on TikTok, you’ll find many things that are a bit hard to watch: students flexing their Harvard Summer School participation, people of all ages wearing Harvard sweatsuits and tagging the University despite posting completely unrelated content, and users performing a seemingly endless supply of “What, like it’s hard?” Elle Woods impersonations.
Diffused among this mess of posers and e-children are videos by a handful of real Harvard students. Their videos tend to show dorm room tours, Yard walkthroughs, Lamont study session laments — elements of the College that people all over the world might be curious about.
All of this, however, is filtered through the lens of the TikTok video style: hard cuts, short takes, and a continuous sense of motion (the sense of rhythm extends beyond the lip sync videos, evidently). Some fall into other archetypes of the app’s videos, like the transformation video — where the video’s subject jumps into another frame, another outfit and, most likely, a song — adjusted to include the #harvard room glow up.
Thus far, no one on the app claims to be a Harvard campus ambassador, so it’s possible we will see the infancy of this campaign blossom over the course of the coming semesters. Maybe TikTok will become as mainstream for adults as apps like Instagram, even while current discourse about the platform tends to conjure words like “cringe,” “absurd,” and “ironic.”
The element of performance, more subtle on other forms of social media, is brought to the forefront with TikTok.
“When you’re filming yourself and you’re alone, you can exaggerate your emotions and be meme-y,” Chiang says.
This public-facing pretense, paired with the autonomy of a smartphone, creates fodder for self-caricature and antics of all kinds. It also adds an element of self-awareness: layers of irony building up to the doomsday-induced shrug of the shoulders that is Gen Z humor. When you’re facing the end of the world, the threshold for laughter seems to dip down slightly.
Could such a thing have a future at Harvard? How could it not?
As we part ways, Chiang is already planning a TikTok to post when this article is published.

I spent countless elementary school afternoons visiting or hosting my paternal grandparents. From our many meetings, I cannot recall any specific anecdotes; each episode curves into the same current, a shallow stream buoying hollow memories of Nai Nai and Gong Gong.
My father opens our door and I carry in Nai Nai’s unasked-for groceries, keeping my gaze fixed on the red “Hong Kong supermarket” plastic bags. After setting the dark green gai lan and red lychee on our kitchen counter, I shuffle down the corridor and back toward my grandparents. Their Fukienese reminds me of a chorus of woodpeckers.
Halfway between the kitchen and the still-open front door is my room. I hesitate, longing to retreat into a comforting barricade of bookshelves and action figures.
My eyes rest on my father’s flat, round face, waiting for his signal. He used to linger as Nai Nai and Gong Gong walked to the kitchen, making sure they were at a safe distance before nudging me forward and whispering, “Go hug your grandparents.” Now, faintly gesturing toward them with his head of graying hair is sufficient to remind me of my grand-filial obligations.
I continue shuffling across the frayed, flaxen-yellow carpet with sagging shoulders and a flat expression. First, I hug Gong Gong, glimpsing his thinning black hair and worn face. Then Nai Nai, her fuzzy sweater rubbing against my nose. Our arms are stiff, and the embrace is momentary.
Walking back to my room, I hear an utterance which, due to its familiar timbre and cadence, no longer requires translation: “When will he learn Chinese?”
I must have watched and heard Nai Nai and Gong Gong for longer than a few moments at the door. But without language I couldn’t — or was too embarrassed to — see and listen. I would like to write that I’m uncomfortable distilling years of interactions with my grandparents into so few words, but there was nothing to “distill”. These impressions, little more than fleshed-out stereotypes, were all I had before this summer.
Each visit trapped me in a positive-feedback loop of shame. Unable to speak with Nai Nai and Gong Gong, I avoided their eyes; the shame of not looking up caused me to flee to my room; guilt from hiding meant I couldn’t look their way during dinner. The shame always returned: five, ten, eighteen years of silence recurrently compounded into a single afternoon.
Most vividly, I remember imagining Nai Nai and Gong Gong’s thoughts and comments: “Why won’t he look up at us?” “Why is his smile so artificial?” “How is this our grandson?”
***
My father had a series of logical reasons for not having me learn Chinese. I would likely learn Mandarin instead of Fukienese, and my grandparents’ Mandarin isn’t great; Chinese afterschool classes are misery-inducing; what Nai Nai and Gong Gong have to say isn’t worth my time.
I can, however, communicate with my maternal grandparents in Italian. I know what it is like for another language to reveal your grandparents’ hobbies, stories, and aspirations. My relationship with my maternal grandparents suggests I should love Nai Nai and Gong Gong dearly, yet in the near-vacuum of communication between us were only guilt, shame, self-disgust — emotions directed entirely toward myself.
Upon coming to Harvard, the decision to study Chinese was finally mine. On the first day of Chinese class, under “Why do you want to learn Chinese?” on the new student questionnaire, I marked, “To speak with family/relatives.”
***
“They’re here!” my father shouted as the doorbell rang. I leapt up and tumbled down the stairs, freshly polished for Thanksgiving. After only 10 weeks of studying Chinese, I hoped to impress.
I grabbed the red grocery bags and hurried back up the stairs. When Nai Nai and Gong Gong entered the living room, my father gave me his familiar signal. Stiff, awkward hugs ensued. I offered to take their jackets — more accurately, I made a series of muddled gestures and mumbled “jacket” until they understood and handed me their coats.
Before I could leave, my mother walked over. “Say something to them.”
I had imagined my first conversation with Nai Nai and Gong Gong dozens of times: Greetings, ask how they’re doing, say that I’m happy at Harvard. It would be slow and awkward; I’d stumble and ask them to repeat themselves; we’d all wear broad grins.
Mired in the inertia of shame, I could not speak at the door as we hugged or while I took their jackets.
Doubts turned my voice into a whisper: I’d only studied Chinese for two months — what if my heavy, tripped-up tongue upset them even more? Could I overcome 18 years of silence with a few words, or would speaking with them be an exercise in self-indulgent repentance?
“你好,” I managed. Hello. My shoulders straightened and my eyes brightened. Neither Nai Nai or Gong Gong seemed to hear.
“Louder,” my mother encouraged. “They’re old.” I shook my head, thankful to have their coats as an excuse to walk to the closet and find at least minimal respite from my cowardice. My feeble attempt was sufficient to temporarily assuage my guilt and not whole-hearted enough to trigger my fears.
That afternoon, I discovered a different kind of shame. Before, I felt guilty for not being able to connect with Nai Nai and Gong Gong; now, I was guilty of refusing to speak with them.
Until I began learning Chinese, it was easy to imagine Nai Nai’s scornful thoughts and assign myself blame. She was an object, totally malleable to my imagination.
If I were to have real conversations with them, the dam between us would break, releasing a deluge: my voice in Nai Nai and Gong Gong’s ears, and theirs in mine. Instead of self-indulgent guilt, I’d have to deal with their words and disappointments, their love and my betrayal, their longings and my failures — not as they existed in my head, but as they existed in theirs. I’d be translated from a simulated neglectful grandson into an actual one.
Throughout the day, I was able to understand snippets — “Matteo needs to eat more,” “The weather is so cold”. Each was an opportunity to jump in, to show I hadn’t checked that box in September for nothing. I remained silent.
***
I spent nine weeks this summer studying Mandarin in Beijing. Each day we learned the equivalent of one week of Chinese at Harvard. I had told myself that not speaking with Nai Nai and Gong Gong was a confidence issue, and that two months of immersive Chinese would be an effective remedy.
We arrived at their house in Flushing, Queens on a Thursday afternoon. Gong Gong answered the door, wearing a wrinkled t-shirt tucked into old shorts. Once again, I mumbled “你好” to no effect.
My father walked away, ignoring my effort. My mother, who studied Mandarin in college, saved me.
“他会说国语,” she said. He can speak Mandarin. Gong Gong raised his sparsely-populated eyebrows and chortled, then turned to ask her if this were true — the language barrier was so ingrained in our relationship that asking me didn’t register as an option.
She told him it was true, that I had studied earnestly in Beijing, and that he should ask me about my time there. Before we could begin talking, Nai Nai came down the stairs. My mother repeated herself and backed away; Nai Nai, Gong Gong, and I began to speak.
The conversation marked a literal transformation in how I interact with my grandparents, yet it would be misleading to write that it felt like a dramatic break with the past — perhaps because there were no trembling words or touching gestures to denote whether our relationship had, indeed, reached a turning point.
We stood in an equilateral triangle, several feet apart from each other. My hands were in my front pockets, their arms at their sides; all were unmoving. They asked me how long I’d been in China; about the climate; about the food. They spent the rest of the afternoon mostly speaking with my father in Fukienese.
Our conversations were fact-oriented. I asked no questions, and few emotions were shared. I’m not sure they fully believed I could speak Mandarin; I’m not sure I fully understood I could speak with them. I had been unable or unwilling to initiate conversation on my own, and even with my mother’s help was unable to bring the conversation anywhere meaningful — or perhaps I was unsure of where to find meaning.
I expected a dam bursting into a cascade; after 18 years of drought, the river ran shallow.
But it was not dry. During high school, I had seen Nai Nai and Gong Gong perhaps once a season; during my first year of college, twice in total. They visited us twice more before I returned to college, averaging to one-and-a-half meetings per week. I remember each occasion and embrace: tight yet delicate, long and deep and suddenly, unlike the hundred hugs before, too brief.

While most athletes prepare for big competitions by staying well-rested, eating well, and keeping calm, Adam Adatto Sandel ’08 has added an unconventional practice to his pre-competition ritual: reading ancient philosophy.
Sandel, a lecturer in Social Studies who sometimes goes by “Professor Pull-Ups”, took back the Guinness World Record title last December for the most pull ups in one minute. This is his fourth time holding the title; he clocked 68 pull ups most recently. Philosophy is integral to his performance: Plato and Socrates, according to Sandel, have a “very strong sense of the fragility of life — not only the possibility of failure,” but also the “difficulty of making a victory last.” In other words, philosophy helps answer a question that’s increasingly relevant to Sandel: “What do you do if you win?”
When I met Sandel in the lobby of the Malkin Athletic Center, he emanated a confident yet approachable vibe, and ushered me around the gym, which is still familiar to him from his days of college training.
Sandel worked out in college to stay fit for baseball, but he didn’t become serious about fitness competitions until after college. In the summer of 2015, the headline on the front page of the Boston Globe — “Marblehead man breaks multiple strength world records” — caught his attention. Marblehead man, otherwise known as Ron Cooper, had broken the world record in “Most pull ups with a 60 lb (27.2 kg) pack in one minute” — and Sandel, who loved pull ups, wanted to be his gym buddy. Sandel cold-called Cooper, who agreed to train with him. Soon after, Sandel became interested in setting a world record for pull ups himself.
In 2016, after a rigorous two-hour-a-day, six-day-a-week training schedule, Sandel succeeded, setting the record with 51 pull ups in one minute. Though Sandel and several others have gone back and forth in claiming the title, Sandel was determined to continuously up his game. When he achieved 68 pull ups in one minute last winter, he officially reclaimed the title. It has yet to be beaten.
Yet Sandel’s deep intellectual curiosity almost eclipses his athletic ability. Before college, Sandel thought social theory “just sounded so boring,” and had no intention of making it his profession. But his first year, Sandel took a course on justice and political philosophy which “grabbed” him, and by his junior year abroad, he was reading philosophy for his own sake. He packed only two books his junior semester abroad in Seville: Aristotle’s Politics and Thomas Hobbes’ On the Citizen. Sandel went on to pursue a Ph.D. in political philosophy at Oxford.
Sandel developed his interest in philosophy on his own, he explains, but his parents, Harvard Law professor and political philosopher Michael J. Sandel and Social Studies lecturer and scholar-in-resident Kiku Adatto, played an implicit role. “[My father is] a master at leading a dialogue, kind of like in the fashion of Socrates: asking questions, eliciting your viewpoints,” says Sandel. “He would do that all the time with [my brother and I growing up]. So in that sense, he certainly influenced me toward philosophy, in the sense of loving wisdom.”
Sandel returned to Cambridge in 2017 to attend Harvard Law School, where he has continued exploring his interest in philosophy and the law. He also teaches in the Social Studies department.
So what’s next for Sandel?
For fitness, he says it is obvious: “I like nice round numbers, so I want to get 70 pull ups and hold down the record. I hope someone beats it actually because that pushes me to get even better.” He also hopes to set the record for most muscle ups in one minute. (A muscle up is a pull up but one also needs to go over the bar.)
Sandel hopes to continue combining his interest in philosophy with his interests in both law and fitness. “I try to take lessons that I would learn in the gym and apply them to life more generally,” he says. “Your goal is an event in its own right; pour everything you have into that and don’t look at the finish line. That is something you learn from training for these pull up competitions.”
He is writing a book now, “Pull Yourself Up: Philosophy, Fitness, and The Good Life,” about the importance of “meaningful activity” to living a worthwhile life. He blogs about the connection between fitness and philosophy as well.
For Sandel, fitness is more than just a hobby or a path to a world record. “I look to training and fitness as… a powerful example, a personal example, [of] the kind of activity that draws together into various parts of your life into a narrative whole that gives you direction, but is also open ended and inspires you to keep going.”

It was like witnessing a drinking game I didn’t know was happening — but still I wanted to be a part of it.
I’d never been to a party like this before. Gowns, laureates, and orchestral renditions of Bach may be the regularly scheduled programming for Sanders Theater, where I found myself on Thursday night. But tonight, for every gown there was instead a lab coat, and if you replaced the cello in Suite No. 1 with an accordion, then you would have the 29th First Annual Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony.
Organized by the Annals of Improbable Research — a bimonthly scientific humor magazine devoted to “genuine, improbable research” — the ceremony awards 10 Ig Nobel Prizes every year to honor “achievements that make people laugh, then think.” The 2019 Ig Nobel Prize ceremony featured real Nobel Laureates like economist Eric S. Maskin ’72 and physicist Jerome I. Friedman handing out awards to studies that conducted simultaneously groundbreaking and unconventional, research, ranging from the conclusion that “pizza might protect against illness and death, if the pizza is made and eaten in Italy,” to “studying how, and why, wombats make cube-shaped poo.”
The theme of this year’s awards was “Habits,” which inspired endless jokes and a four-part mini-opera, “Creatures of Habit.” Though the event functioned as award shows normally do, with an audience gathered to witness the presentation of trophies to a select group of people on stage, there was a casual ease underlying the night’s proceedings rather than a tense air of competition. Whereas Oscars envelopes are guarded by the Los Angeles Police Department before reaching the stage, Ig Nobel prizes were transported in a brown paper bag from Staples, and at moments the divide between the spectators and the honorees collapsed completely.
Any time someone on stage would say “bad habits,” audience members would woot or excitedly chant “HABITS!” I kept checking the program to see if there was a codified list of rules to this peculiar drinking game; I never found one.
Though Marc A. Abrahams ’78, editor and co-founder of the Annals of Improbable Research, acted as emcee for the awards, the real ringleader of the night was the sequined-tutu-clad Miss Sweetie Poo, an 8-year-old responsible for kicking winners off the stage if their acceptance speeches exceeded one minute. This happened a few times. Winners hastily gathered their papers and their prize — a branded coffee cup glued to a base and stuffed with a toothbrush, lottery tickets, a cigarette butt, and other “habits” — while struggling to maintain composure as a girl dressed like a ballerina yelled: “PLEASE STOP. I’M BORED.”
After the presentation of the final award and the conclusion of the last libretto, Ig Nobel prize winners shook hands with Nobel Prize winners on a stage scattered with paper airplanes. Their faces were lit by flashlights directed by “human spotlights,” covered in silver body paint. Abrahams took to the stage once again to thank the many featured performers and researchers, ending with: “If you didn’t win an Ig Nobel prize this year – and especially if you did – better luck next year.” It was the last of a series of inside jokes that I wished had been explained to me earlier.

The College Events Board has announced a competition in which students can submit proposals for Harvard’s new mascot. Open submission allows for the possibility that Harvard could next be represented by the smell of a loved one or Human Kindness, or another intangible entity that would need to be special-ordered from the mascot costume store. To glimpse the future of Harvard spirit, we deployed a variety of espionage tactics — assassinations, good old-fashioned bribery, winning smiles — in an attempt to secure access to the CEB’s top mascot options. Instead, we found a list of mascots the CEB already nixed.
Urgent Care-sper: The Friendly Ghost of Overnight Healthcare
Bio: In the summer of 2019, we lost an unsung hero — a humble helper who was always there when we were at our lowest. When we had broken bones, he offered band-aids. When we suffered severe allergic reactions, he offered saltines. He has no mouth, but he screams out alternative solutions to our overnight healthcare concerns.
Special Skill(s): Doesn’t exist in the mortal plane but is still more helpful than HUHS during normal hours.
Catchphrase: “When something strange, is going on, who you gonna call? ‘A skilled clinician who will provide you with instantaneous education about your health, home treatment options, and available resources.’”
Reason For Rejection: Who needs healthcare when Lowell has a theater room now?
The Harvard Snakes
Bio: It's tough getting into Harvard, but somehow, we all slithered in. To get to the top, you’ve gotta be a cold-blooded individual who isn’t afraid to wallow in the dirt. Maybe you started off as an idealistic CS nerd who wanted to use their Python skills to end homelessness. But history shows that volunteering won’t help you catch that Canada Goose.
Special Skill(s): Making it rain — acid rain, that is, from illegal chemical runoff.
Catchphrase: “The market will regulate itself!”
Reason For Rejection: Ample supply, not enough demand
Lotso the Lottery Application 
Bio: In life, you win some and you lose some — including your ability to graduate because you didn’t complete your academic requirements. Lotso champions the unfortunate truth that despite your best efforts, and your professor’s guarantee that “seniors get priority,” the arbitrary stipulations imposed on your academic career are really there to force you to grovel for admission to courses.
Special Skill(s): Increases anxiety levels of all participants.
Catchphrase: “Thank you for your application, but we’re sorry to inform you…”
Reason For Rejection: No idea, but I wish I could have known before shopping week ended.
Mt. Auburn Menace
Bio: The Mt. Auburn Menace is the tortured soul of a 300-year-old Harvard student still trying to get into one final club — any final club, really. The Menace isn’t one of the “good guys,” and the more that hateful op-eds are published about it in The Crimson, the stronger it grows. It embodies the Harvard ideal of ignoring anyone who tells you to change because, obviously, you’re right. And even if you aren’t, that’s okay — you have enough money to convince people otherwise.
Special Skill(s): Impunity from Harvard Sanctions.
Catchphrase: “Ain’t no laws when you’re drinking Claws and have hundreds of wealthy alumni to back you up!”
Reason For Rejection: Unpaid dues.
Harvard Scarlet
Bio: Everyone knows Scarlet is the new Crimson. Think about it — there’s no Crimson Johansson, there’s no Crimson Fever, and there’s no Rotten Tomatoes Certified Fresh 2010 teen comedy featuring Emma Stone, Amanda Bynes, and Stanely Tucci inspired by a classic novel The Crimson Letter. Not only is the Wikipedia page for “scarlet” longer than the one for “crimson,” it also represents salacious themes like sin and prositution. That’s especially relevant when your university perfected the prostitution model by selling body and soul to anyone who likes it hot.
Special Skill(s): Brands heretics with a red-hot iron.
Catchphrase: “We changed our mascot but it’s still just a color!”
Reason For Rejection: You can’t market a fucking color.

The concrete expanse of City Hall Plaza has transformed into Boston’s largest outdoor gym.
I have to blink twice before it registers. Punching arms and kicking feet. A white-haired gentleman in New Balance sneakers following each stomp exactly two beats behind. A woman in a bright orange tutu chest-pumping until she needs to pause, mid-song, for water.
Then I notice the sky: Threatening clouds hang over the sea of bouncing ponytails. The idea of dancing in the rain spontaneously is vaguely appealing. Organized mass Zumba under a guaranteed storm? Considerably less so.
***
It’s barely noon on Saturday, and FM has sent me to a dance party in the middle of Boston hosted nominally by Mayor Martin J. Walsh. Part of me wonders if the mayor is partaking in the festivities himself. After all, anyone can benefit from a class hosted by 305 Fitness, a cardio, zumba, and hip hop workout studio whose goal is to “#MakeSweatSexy.”
This 305 popup class is one of the last programs in a full day of activities for the 4th Annual Boston Social Fitness Festival. Its goal is to “get Boston moving!” by sponsoring a free day of exercise-related activities. The day kicked off at 7 a.m. with Daybreaker, a morning dance party with an “Epic 90s Back to School ‘Sunrise Recess’” theme (open to interpretation), and then powered through various fitness classes led by local gyms. Behind the main stage, an open air spin studio sits beside kombucha stands and vendors offering “gluten-free honey vanilla crunch” samples. The programs culminate in the Dance Mile, which is exactly what it sounds like: Participants dance for a mile on closed off city streets behind a massive, bedazzled float blasting music. Think of the parade scene in “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” but with more neon.
The Dance Mile is technically an independent traveling company, but its registration fees have been covered by Martin J. Walsh for Saturday’s event. Similar to the Color Run (though not yet quite as big), the Dance Mile has hit cities from Chicago to Minneapolis to Colorado Springs. It seems relatively new — the website’s earliest reported event is in May 2015 — which tells me it’s a younger sibling in the millennial family of Sweatcoin and Sweetgreen and SoulCycle.
Their website promises “5280 feet of pure awesomeness.” Under the rules section, they insist in all caps to “HAVE THE MOST FUN POSSIBLE.”
***
As the float starts to crawl away from City Hall Plaza, blasting funky Latin pop and streaming bubbles, it seems as if people will be breaking the Dance Mile’s website’s command to “Dance first, think later.” Energy is low as people glance side to side in self-conscious chagrin. We shamble forward to the beat, arms swinging halfheartedly. Each person is trying to gauge exactly how much hype is socially acceptable.
But then from the float, a dancer wearing a backwards orange baseball cap begins to fist pump, raining down pink feathers from the boa around his neck, and we collectively decide to be more hype. Before the chorus even begins, people are itching to jump.
The crowd seems to be mostly women of all ages and sizes, but more men and children are woven between them than I had expected. Nearby, a teenage girl decides her plastic fedora is too much trouble to dance with and stoops low, still bopping, to offer it to a small sullen boy in a chartreuse fleece. A bright blue t-shirt sails through the air from the back of the truck, and a tall man snatches it before the shorter waving arms around him can grasp its fabric. After a second’s pause, he hands it to the girl next to him, who smiles at him with bright, transparent affection.
“We’re about to go past a construction site! Let’s show ’em how to move!”
The front row closest to the speakers is occupied by a group of teenagers in fishnet tights, face glitter, and seashell-adorned headbands, who go absolutely wild when Whitney Houston’s “I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)” blasts forth from the speakers. Two toddlers ride like royalty above the pulsing, throbbing masses on their parents’ shoulders, each sporting an impassive expression; one wears pigtails and a unicorn horn headband while the other chews on the flowers in his lei.
Though the two toddlers remain aloof, the rest of the crowd becomes more euphoric, screaming along with the lyrics and erupting into fist-pumping, gyrating, twerking pandemonium. It’s hard not to be swept up in the contagion when you’re swimming in a stream of bubbles and the bass is loud enough for you to forget the real world. It’s almost a relief to bust down with wild abandon, sober and in the light of day, while passersby on Congress Street take pictures in befuddled, pleasant surprise.
A woman tries to FaceTime her mother in the middle of the crowd, but when her voice fails to carry even after pressing her face to the microphone, she screams, “Love you Mom, bye!” and promptly gives up. After all, how could you not be present when surrounded by such color and sound and joyfully flailing limbs? What is dignity when everyone around you knows all the words to “All Star” and “I Want It That Way”?
As we turn the corner back towards City Hall, one of the event organizers in the front row taps our photographer on the shoulder and hollers, “Here’s a picture for you!” She sashays up to a traffic policeman and shimmies into his space. Before he can even react, another organizer brandishing a neon yellow flag joins them, and three attendees seize their opportunity. He chuckles, resigned but flattered, and starts to step-touch-clap to the Shawn Mendes single closing the parade.
A passing taxi driver honks at the final beat drop and flashes a thumbs up out the window. People clamor toward the float the last song ends, eyes full of hope, grabby fingers reaching for free shirts, and then it’s over. The event organizers try to direct the crowd toward a “post-workout party,” but the masses disintegrate too quickly. Clutching plastic sunglasses and neon leis, people check their phones and hustle away to their real lives.
Men wearing headsets disassemble pop up stands and wheel dollies of merchandise away. Soon, all that is left of the fitness jubilee is a few abandoned fedoras and half-drunk bottles of kombucha rolling like tumbleweeds across the plaza.

One Thursday last January, Felix Brody decided to skip classes at Somerville High School. Instead, he spent the day hopping in and out of about a dozen meetings at the Massachusetts State House.
“We laid out our case,” says Brody. “Which is that 16-year-olds deserve the right to vote.”
Brody is one of the many student activists in Massachusetts who spends his free time advocating for students’ rights. Today, one of the issues he is committed to is lowering the voting age in Massachusetts to 16 for municipal elections.
“My eyes have been opened to the power of youth and how active youth are in their communities,” Brody explains. He has worked with Vote16MA, a subset of Vote16 USA, which is a national campaign to lower the voting age. In addition to that advocacy, he serves as an organizer for March For Our Lives Boston, and he founded the Massachusetts chapter of the gun violence prevention organization 50 Miles More.
“After being involved with youth activism, it’s very hard not to be a full supporter of lowering the voting age,” he reflects.
Brody and his peers make the argument that if 16-year-olds can work, pay taxes, drive a car, and take to the streets to agitate for change, they also deserve the right to vote.
“Sixteen and 17-year-olds pay taxes in a country founded on, in part, frustration from colonists who were taxed without any representation,” Brody explains. “Why are we doing the same to young people today?”
This initiative has achieved some local success. This May, the Somerville City Council unanimously passed a measure to lower the voting age to 16 for municipal elections, solidifying support within the council to submit a proposal to the state legislature.
Somerville’s city council has submitted a home rule petition, a request to the Massachusetts state legislature to change the voting age. Now, they must wait for approval. They’re not alone: Other cities, including Concord, Ashfield, Shelbourne, Northampton, and Wendell also voted to create similar proposals to lower the voting age but still await changes at the state-level.
In July 2018, Northampton City Council unanimously endorsed lowering the voting age to 16 in their municipal elections.
“We first brought the initiative to our city council and mayor, who passed a non-binding resolution supporting it unanimously,” explains Noah Freidman-Kassis, a 17-year-old from Northampton. Like Brody, Kassis has dedicated himself to the fight for youth voting rights.
Then, Kassis and other organizers successfully lobbied for a binding initiative. The measure to lower the voting age was added to the city’s new charter. But Kassis notes that this isn’t the end of the process.
“Change takes time,” explained Kassis. “If it takes three to four years, which is likely, that’s actually really quick. The hard part is what comes next. The hard part will be getting it through the state house. We’re going to start working more closely with state house and state senator.”
On a statewide level, Vote16 MA is pushing for the Empower Act, a bill that would change Massachussetts’s home rule petition system. Under the Empower Act, if a local government uses their own legislative process, that municipality can lower the voting age without state-level approval. In Maryland, four municipalities have already successfully lowered their local voting age, due to the lack of state-level restrictions on municipal action.
In 2013, Takoma Park, Md. became the first city in the US to lower their voting age, permitting 16-year-olds to vote in local elections. Hyattsville, Md. followed Takoma Park by lowering their voting age in 2015. And in the fall of 2018, two more Maryland cities lowered their voting ages as well.
Despite the legislative barriers to full enactment of a lower voting age in Massachusetts, young advocates believe that a lower voting age is key to greater civic engagement in the long term.
“A lower voting age ensures a greater likelihood of voting as a habit,” Una Oljaca, a 17-year-old activist from Concord, Mass., wrote in an email.
“When we entrust younger people with participating in their local political process, we ease them into the responsibility of being able to vote for something as important as the next president of the United States,” Oljaca continued.
The value of habitual voting is a critical argument used by proponents for a lower voting age. In a 2017 essay, Joshua A. Douglas, an associate professor from the University of Pennsylvania Law School, argues that when voters show up to the polls once, they’re more likely to do it again.
To these youth organizers, it’s not just about whether or not they’ll continue to vote when they’re adults. It’s also about acknowledging the kind of civic engagement they’ve already demonstrated.
“The kids I go to school with are the most engaged people I know,” Kassis elaborates. “We’ve hosted town halls for our senator and our congressman about the Green New Deal. We’ve hosted a candidates forum for our state legislators. We walked out in support of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and survivors of sexual assault. We’ve walked out in support of the Parkland survivors.”
And according to CIRCLE, the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts, research by Daniel Hart and Robert Atkins demonstrates that 16-year-olds are about as politically knowledgeable as 21-year-olds.
In 2019, Congressmember Ayanna Pressley introduced an amendment to lower the national voting age to 16. She represents Massachussett’s 7th district, which includes Somerville.
“Across the Massachusetts 7th, young people are leading the way – from gun violence, to climate change, to the future of work – they are organizing, mobilizing, and calling us to action,” Pressley’s office wrote in an emailed statement.
Pressley’s amendment was voted down 305-126 in March. Yet in Massachusetts, youth activists still continue to fight.
“Anything that can give young people power in their own world is valuable,” Freidman-Kassis says. “Above all, I’m incredibly optimistic. Working with my fellow young people for positive change fills me with hope that the sheer refusal of my generation to surrender will help us prevail.”

Harvard University Health Services Director Paul J. Barreira will stay involved at the University as the director of the Graduate Student Mental Health Initiative after he steps down from his current role on Nov. 18.
The initiative is a collaborative effort between Harvard graduate students, faculty, and Barrerira himself. Its goal is to assess the prevalence of mental health issues among graduate students and to identify specific factors that contribute to the general well-being of students.
Working out of the Provost office, Barreira will continue to survey graduate students and analyze the data of mental health surveys he launched two years ago.
“We’ve done — all total — we've surveyed with 3,000 students. These are graduate students and professional students, doctoral students, and master students,” Barriera said. “We’re giving the results to the graduate students and to their departments, even as we speak.”
Currently, Barreira is speaking with various departments regarding the survey results. These departments include Astrophysics, Sociology, Classics, Philosophy, Romance Languages, and Comparative Literature Departments and their respective graduate students at the GSAS. He is also speaking to the Harvard School of Public Health and the Harvard Kennedy School.
Barreira said the public will not have access to the survey results since they are only disclosed to their respective departments.
“We’re giving them out at the department level,” Barreira said in reference to the survey results.
In addition to analyzing student surveys across new departments, Barreira is also revisiting departments and professional schools he previously surveyed. For example, since the initial survey two years ago, the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences implemented changes to improve students’ mental health.
“They've had a workgroup, which never existed before, just graduate student representatives and faculty talking about issues of supporting graduate students,” Barreira said.
The Earth and Planetary Sciences department is also partnering with the Psychology department to launch new programs and workshops, such as one focused on managing stress, anxiety, and depression, according to Barreira.
“Maybe one of the best things that's coming out of this is actually forming working groups that can operate before members of the graduate students and faculty,” Barreira said.
Barreira was set to step down as director on June 30, but following an extended search for his successor, he will remain in his current post until November.
Giang T. Nguyen, who is set to take over the role of executive director on November 18, previously served as the director of Student Health Services at the University of Pennsylvania.
“I don’t know when the next activity is [for HUHS and their workgroups], but everybody’s committed — whether I’m here or not — to figure out a better way to provide health care and education,” Barreira said.
Barreira said in the meantime he has his mind set on the Graduate Student Mental Health Initiative.
“My brain is on graduate students,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow joined hundreds of college and university presidents across the country in signing onto two letters urging legislators to provide permanent protections for undocumented immigrant students and those experiencing visa delays and uncertainty.
Harvard’s decision to sign these letters comes as Bacow has been particularly vocal in his opposition to Trump Administration immigration policies.
“By partnering with others, we join higher education’s collective voice in raising concerns about the current status of Dreamers and those caught up by delays in visa processing,” University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement.
More than 600 college and university presidents signed onto a letter Sept. 16 organized by the American Council of Education at Harvard’s request. The letter comes two years after President Trump threatened to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an Obama Administration-era program that allows undocumented youth to live and work in the United States.
The letter calls on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to pass bipartisan legislation to protect DACA recipients — legislation that the presidents noted is popular among their constituents.
“We believe it is long overdue for Congress to pass bipartisan legislation, in both the House and Senate, to provide permanent protection for Dreamers—young, undocumented, high-achieving individuals brought to our country as children," the letter reads. “We understand the Supreme Court will soon be considering DACA. But regardless of the Court's decision, legislative action will remain necessary."
Separately, Bacow joined 42 Massachusetts college and university presidents in a letter addressed to members of the state’s congressional delegation pertaining to issues international students and scholars face, such as visa delays.
“In 2018, over 68,000 international students enrolled in Massachusetts colleges and universities, contributing over $3 billion to our economy,” the letter reads. “An environment that thwarts the opportunities for and contributions of these individuals is detrimental to the state’s economy, undermines the educational experiences of all Massachusetts college students, and stifles future innovation and business growth.”
The letter specifically addresses delays in visa processing, Optional Practical Training — which allows international students to apply to work for a United States employer in direct relation to their field of study, and requests for additional evidence when international employees seek to teach and work on campus.
Bacow raised similar issues in a July letter sent to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin K. McAleenan in which he said he has a “deep concern” over current immigration policies.
In that letter, he pointed to visa delays, denials, and uncertainty for recipients of both DACA and Temporary Protected Status — a program offering legal protection to those who emigrate from countries plagued by natural disasters or violence.
More than a month after Bacow’s letter to the Cabinet members, Harvard student Ismail B. Ajjawi ’23 made international headlines when U.S. Customs and Border Protection denied his entry to the U.S.
Agents denied Ajjawi, a Palestinian resident of Lebanon, entry into the country after questioning him and looking through his phone and computer. Officials allegedly found anti-American social media posts made by his friends on his feed and then canceled Ajjawi’s visa and refused to let him into the country.
Bacow was directly involved in securing Ajjawi’s eventual travel to campus after he was denied entry into the country, according to Ajjawi’s lawyer. Ajjawi eventually arrived on campus 10 days after he planned, on Sept. 2.
Correction: Sept. 22, 2019
A previous verison of this article incorrectly attributed the statement "By partnering with others, we join higher education’s collective voice in raising concerns about the current status of Dreamers and those caught up by delays in visa processing" to President Lawrence S. Bacow. In fact, the statement comes from University spokesperson Jason A. Newton.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said the process of ensuring international students arrive on campus has become increasingly “unpredictable” in recent years, amid changes to immigration policy under the Trump administration.
“We always have been working with our international office to bring students here. I think in recent years it's become more unpredictable, with respect to immigration and visa issues,” Khurana said in a Wednesday interview.
Harvard recently intervened in one College student’s visa re-application process after United States Customs and Border Protection detained him at Boston Logan Airport and denied him entry to the U.S. That student — Ismail B. Ajjawi ’23, a Palestinian resident of Lebanon — spent eight hours at the airport, where he was subjected to questioning about his religion and a search of his personal electronics.
Ajjawi told The Crimson a CBP officer reviewed his social media accounts for several hours before informing him that she had found anti-American posts by his Facebook friends. She then informed him his visa was canceled and that he would be denied entry into the country.
Asked about Ajjawi’s case, Khurana said he believes an important part of his role is supporting students when they face immigration difficulties, and that he believes international students contribute greatly to Harvard and the United States.
“My primary concern is for our student and their family, and then making sure that they feel supported, that we are able to provide whatever information that is needed from us,” Khurana said. “As an immigrant myself, I believe that this country's strength comes from its continual capacity to renew itself, and that our strength is our diversity.”
During the subsequent 10-day period he spent in Lebanon, Ajjawi received an outpouring of support from Harvard affiliates and student groups. Both Harvard administrators and outside lawyers lobbied government officials, asking them to grant him a visa so he could begin classes alongside the other members of the Class of 2023.
Though Ajjawi arrived in Cambridge on Sept. 2, immigration experts said his case is representative of trends that could imperil international undergraduates in future years. Earlier this year, the State Department announced it would collect visa applicants’ social media information as part of the vetting process, among other changes.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow recently spoke out against facets of current U.S. immigration policy in an email to Harvard affiliates earlier this month. He specifically criticized immigration “disruptions and delays” that students traveling to the United States have increasingly faced. In 2017, four graduate students were temporarily denied entry to the country due to a Trump immigration order, which restricted travel from several majority-Muslim countries.
Khurana praised resources the College offers to support international students during the Wednesday interview. In particular, he cited the Freshman International Program, one of the College’s weeklong pre-orientation programs.
“My understanding is that it’s an incredibly strong student community, where [upperclassmen] who have more familiarity are very robust in terms of not only just supporting those students during that pre-orientation program, but really, my understanding is it really forms friendships that last,” he said.
Khurana said he admires students who travel thousands of miles to attend Harvard.
“These are amazing students,” he said. “The courage that it takes to come to a place that's thousands of miles from where you grew up, where your family is, and to basically open yourself up to an educational system that might be different from your domicile.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Flat Patties — a casual burger eatery in Harvard Square — will exit its Brattle Street location amidst a slew of closings in the area.
The restaurant has operated on Brattle Street since 2014, after migrating from its former locale in the Garage in Harvard Square. Flat Patties’ current retail space is owned by Asana Partners, the North Carolina-based development company that owns several retail storefronts on Brattle St.
The owners of Black Ink, a neighboring stationery store that also occupies an Asana Partners space, alleged that they are being forced to close due to rising rent prices charged by Asana. Black Ink recently launched a campaign that allows customers to offer their opinions on the changing commercial landscape of Harvard Square.
Representatives of Asana Partners did not respond to requests for comment.
Restaurateur Tom J. Brush, who owns Flat Patties, Felipés Taqueria, and Crema Café, which departed the Square last December, said the decision to leave Harvard Square was influenced by rising rent prices and not affected by underwhelming sales.
“While our sales are solid, certainly the landlord, after purchasing this property almost two years ago, they really need to generate more rental revenue from the property,” he said. “There’s demand out there, so certainly they are interested in maximizing their revenue.”
Brush also said that though Flat Patties’s lease will expire on Nov. 1, the store will continue to occupy the space until Asana finds a new tenant. He said that if the current terms of the lease had stayed the same, the store would have remained in the Square.
“I don’t think it was our choice to close,” he said. “If we had been able to continue the lease on the current terms, we would have stayed.”
“I certainly accept and understand their need to find a tenant who will pay that rent and who will have the sales to justify that rent,” he added.
Frequent Flat Patties patrons said they were disappointed to hear about the restaurant’s closing.
Cambridge resident Katie Keane said she is sad to see another inexpensive eatery depart the Square. Chipotle, Qdoba, and Au Bon Pain are some of the restaurants that have closed their doors in 2019.
“I work in Harvard Square, and this was a common place for me to come grab lunch. It’s really one of the best places in Harvard Square because it’s really affordable,” Keane said. “I’m sad to these businesses go.”
Jason Xavier, who works and lives in Cambridge, said he will miss Flat Patties’s convenience.
“It has good service, it has quick service, and it’s right next to the train,” he explained. “I haven’t lived in Cambridge for very long, but I have lived here long enough to see that good things don’t stay that long.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Freshly renovated Lowell House features a new "Dynamic Energy Suite" – a six-bedroom pod of dorm rooms with built-in technological enhancements that monitor power consumption and adjust lighting for better sleep and energy efficiency.
Physics professor Mara Prentiss and Harvard Medical School professor Steven W. Lockley collaborated to design these systems as part of a pilot project. If the systems substantially impact the Lowell residents’ well-being and encourage more sustainable living habits, Harvard may eventually adopt the technologies on a larger scale, according to Prentiss and Lockley.
“We have the opportunity in the Sustainability Suite to pilot this type of lighting for the students’ residences, with the hope that if the pilot goes well, we’ll install the type of lighting across the university, which will help with the quite well-established problems that students have with sleep and alertness, and from that sometimes mood and metabolic problems,” Lockley said.
Brandon P. Geller ’08, assistant director of sustainability and energy management in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, wrote in an emailed statement that the occupants of the Dynamic Energy Suite will eventually be engaged in a study focusing on sleep health and energy consumption.
“Harvard House Renewal and the Office for Sustainability are committed to leveraging the talent of our students and faculty to use our campus as a living laboratory for piloting and proving solutions to the world’s greatest sustainability challenges,” Geller wrote.
Prentiss said that the idea for tracking energy usage in dorm rooms came out of her course Freshman Seminar 27: “Energy Be the Change.” The students in the fall 2016 iteration of her course collectively developed a plan for what she called a “smart dorm” — a suite equipped with technology that would help residents keep track of their energy usage and compare it with average levels of consumption throughout the house. Prentiss pitched it to Harvard’s Sustainability Office and subsequently to a Harvard facilities management team in March 2016.
“I was really pleased that something students did as their class project became a physical reality,” Prentiss said. “Harvard students matter. You guys came up with this and made it happen. And I think that's really valuable.”
More than 15 years ago, Lockley and his team discovered a light-sensitive cell connected to the portion of the human brain that controls the circadian clock, which in part governs sleep patterns. By adjusting the intensity of blue light, the researchers could control the alertness of the brain.
“In the daytime, when we want to be awake and alert, we used a blue-enriched white light. It has a high intensity that provides an alerting response to the brain,” Lockley said.
Conversely, in the evening, systems in the suite remove blue wavelengths, emitting a redder light that encourages the brain to prepare for sleep.
The lights used in the suite are LEDs, or light-emitting diodes, which consume less energy than commonly used incandescent or fluorescent lamps.
“If you, for example, took out the fluorescent lights in your home or factory or school and replaced it with LEDs, you would get about a 50-percent reduction in energy use, so you would be much more energy-efficient,” Lockley said.
The same lighting system that Lockley designed is also being used on the International Space Station to calibrate the astronauts’ biological clocks to when they should be awake and when they should be asleep. NASA funded much of his lab’s basic research on circadian photoreceptors, Lockley said.
“It’s pretty true to say we’ve taken space-age technology and put it into Lowell House,” Lockley said.
Pedro L. Cunha Farias ’20, a Lowell resident who lives in the suite, said he thinks the built-in energy-monitoring systems have “definitely” encouraged him to consume less energy than normal.
“I think it’s honestly awesome that the University is doing this because it’s a great way to increase awareness as to how much energy we’re consuming, because quite frankly sometimes it’s higher than you’d expect,” Farias said.
“I think in some sense there’s a competitive aspect to this. We just recently learned that we can see by room how much energy that they’re spending, so I think that that has driven down some of our consumption,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College’s Dean of Students’ Office added a policy requiring neutral moderators at events with “controversial” speakers to this year’s resource guide for extracurricular organizations.
The new section of the guidebook states that groups bringing high-profile, controversial, or “VIP” guests to campus must notify the DSO at least a month in advance, and that a moderator may need to attend events if the DSO finds it necessary or if a group requests one. In most cases, the moderator will be a DSO employee, but student groups can also request that a member of the Harvard faculty or administration act as the moderator instead.
The moderator policy is listed under the heading “Free Speech and Expression” and is prefaced with a statement advocating for free speech on campus.
“The principles of free speech and the free interchange of ideas are fundamental to the Harvard community,” the resource guide states. “You should align your student organization’s programming with the value of free speech particularly if you are hosting an event where these principles have the potential to be compromised.”
The resource book states that moderators will employ a “two-strike policy” against audience members who disrupt events and will have the power to warn and remove disruptive attendees.
“Members of the audience will learn where they stand; they will know where the line is. If people cross that declared line again, they cannot claim not to have realized they were disruptive,” the section explaining the warning procedure states.
Moderators will also be able to cancel events if they believe there is a “clear threat” of violence or damage to University property.
This is the first year the policy is specifically outlined for student group leaders, Assistant Dean for Student Engagement and Leadership Kate Colleran wrote in an emailed statement Wednesday. Harvard first adopted a moderation policy as part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Free Speech Guidelines in 1990.
Several speakers invited to campus in recent years have inspired controversy and debates over free speech at Harvard. In 2017, the Open Campus Initiative invited controversial sociologist Charles A. Murray ’65 , drawing large groups of both audience members and protesters. Murray’s work — which has been denounced and discredited by many academics — links race to differences in IQ.
Christian group Harvard College Faith and Action invited “ex-gay” speaker Jackie Hill-Perry to campus in 2018, where she was also met by dozens of student and faculty protestors.
Colleran also wrote that the DSO added the free speech policy to the resource book to reduce student confusion about it and reiterate the College’s commitment to free speech.
“Adding it to the Resource Guide demonstrates how important we feel it is for student organizations to know we support them in the ‘free interchange of ideas,’” she wrote.
Several student leaders of clubs that frequently host events with speakers said they agree with the policy broadly but are skeptical of its potential impact.
Chair of the Harvard Political Union Matthew S. Miller ’21 and Harvard Republican Club President Victoria M. Marquez ’20 both said they hope the policy will balance the free speech rights of speakers and protestors. They pointed to an Institute of Politics event last semester during which protestors advocating for divestment from fossil fuels and private prisons interrupted a discussion featuring University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Harvard Graduate School of Education Dean Bridget Terry Long.
“If you're interrupting an event and stopping other people who came to hear that event from hearing those views, maybe those people in the crowd don't agree with the views, they just want to hear what this person has to say,” Marquez said. “I think that's when policies like this can be helpful.”
She added that the policy does present some logistical hurdles, citing the requirement that clubs notify the DSO of potentially controversial or high-profile speakers a month before the event. Marquez said that many speakers with busy schedules may not be able to confirm a month or more in advance.
“It does put an extra burden on the club. It's an extra loop you have to jump through, that probably more of the conservative clubs would have to jump through, I think, than the liberal clubs just because of the protest culture on campus,” she said. “I hope the implementation doesn't put an extra burden on clubs that want to bring high-profile speakers to campus.”
Miller also said he is skeptical of the policy’s ability to prevent disruptions at events. He added that his group uses open question-and-answer sessions in order to give audience members time to share their dissenting views.

Harvard Square staple Out of Town News will officially close its doors at the end of October.
Plans to restore the 64-year-old newsstand, which is located in front of the Harvard Square T stop, have been in the works for almost a year. The upcoming construction will renovate the elevator leading to the underground station and make necessary repairs to the kiosk’s historic structure.
Out of Town News has sold newspapers from around the globe to Cambridge residents, students, and celebrities. Famous patrons included poet Robert Frost, celebrity chef Julia Child, and Microsoft founders Paul Allen and Bill Gates. The Cambridge Historical Commission voted to designate the kiosk a landmark in October 2017. 
The closing comes at a time of extensive commercial turnover in the Square; Urban Outfitters, Crema Cafe, and Chipotle, among others, have all closed their doors in the past year.
Though the structure will remain intact after construction completes, the kiosk will no longer be in operation due to growing competition for customers in Harvard Square and the declining demand for print papers, according to Executive Director of the Harvard Square Business Association Denise A. Jillson.
“I believe what they make is one dime on every paper that you sell,” said Jillson. “The millennial cohort, and many of the... boomer [generation] get their news online. So fewer and fewer newspapers are being sold.”
Out of Town News also sold Harvard-branded clothing and items that Jillson said could be purchased elsewhere.
“They’re selling Harvard insignia or whatever that you can purchase at the Coop and [Harvard] Student Agencies or elsewhere in the Square, and cigarettes, and lottery tickets, and, frankly, pornography,” Jillson said. “Those three things… if people want to buy it, there are other places to buy.”
Out of Town News owner Mike Patel did not respond to a request for comment.
Jillson said she is “really pleased” that Out of Town News’ purpose in Harvard Square has reached its expiration date.
“It’s time to move on,” she said. “It’s going to be wonderful.”
Somerville, Mass. resident Cara J. Giaimo said Out of Town News was the first place she would go if she ever needed a physical newspaper.
“I always think of it as a very communal space,” she said. “When you go inside, you can get so many things from so many different places.”
Lesley University student Joe Hammond said he will miss the newsstand’s unique offerings.
“I’m an illustrator, so I’m really into editorial illustrations,” Hammond said. “Out of Town News is so convenient and iconic for the area.”
Benjamin J. Dreier ’22, a Crimson Technology editor, said he was not shocked to hear of the closing.
“It’s a staple of the Square, but I don’t get my news from there and I don’t know anyone who gets their news from there,” Dreier said. “But, like all other changes in the Square, it’s sad to see all these old businesses go and see the landscape shift.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To close out the 2018 season, the Harvard football team wrapped up a three-game win streak that culminated in a thrashing of Yale in front of a friendly crowd at Fenway Park. But that was 44 weeks ago, and 44 weeks is a long time — one of the largest offseasons in college football. Three weeks longer than the University of San Diego, the team the Crimson will fly across the country to challenge on foreign turf Saturday afternoon.
In that space of time, between the rambunctious victory over it’s perennial rival to the fielding of a new team, Harvard has had nothing but itself as a tackling dummy. And for the last two weeks, while other teams took the field, the Crimson players watched from their common rooms.
“We get a little antsy, we start building that anticipation, we start getting real hungry,” said captain defensive back Wesley Ogsbury. “Everybody else is playing, we’re just sitting and practicing, practicing, practicing. We’re getting hungrier and hungrier.”
That hunger, the desire for live action, is palpable in every player on the team.
“Our team is hungry,” junior quarterback Jake Smith said. “We’ve been pushing for excellence everyday in practice. It’s been a long preseason just practicing against each other and we can’t wait to get out on the field. We’re ready to actually get out there and get some live action.”
The team Harvard will field on Saturday will look very different from the one that exited The Game victorious in November 2018. The team has since graduated 31 seniors.
“We lost some outstanding kids in the offensive and defensive line, those are never easy to replace,” coach Tim Murphy said. “So we’ll be relatively young on both the offensive and defensive side of the line.”
The youth on defense will likely materialize as an all-sophomore defensive front. The coaching staff is specifically eyeing sophomore end Truman Jones, sophomore tackle Jacob Sykes, sophomore tackle Chris Smith, and several other sophomores for the other end.
The youth doesn’t concern the captain.
“We just recruit guys that are hungry,” Ogsbury said. “It doesn't matter how old they are or how much experience they have.”
Inexperience is not endemic across the entirety of the defense. Ogsbury himself leads leads the team, and the defense more closely, as the 146th captain of Harvard football. The defensive back finished third in the nation last season in interceptions, averaging .6 per game. In keeping with tradition, Ogsbury serves as the sole captain for the team.
“The first thing about Wes is you’ve got to lead by example and nobody works harder,” Murphy said. “The second thing is nobody is more competitive. He’s done an outstanding job, our kids really respond to him.”
A definitive strong point for the Crimson entering the season is the special teams unit. Sophomore Jon Sot returns as a punter. As a freshman, Sot led the conference in average punt distance at 41.1 yards.
In case of closer proximity to the endzone, the team returns senior place kicker Jake McIntyre. Harvard fans may remember him as the man who booted the field goal as time expired to secure an exciting victory against the Holy Cross in 2018. The Crimson staticians will remember him for years to come. The veteran is tied for first in program history in two categories — most field goals in a season and career field goals. With a whole season to kick, McIntyre will undoubtedly move into sole possession of these program records, and others for which he already ranks top five.
Three days before the Ivy League teams launch the 2019 season, Harvard football exudes confidence. Ogsbury said the team has the personnel to “take it all the way.” Smith said he’s confident with the guys surrounding him on the offensive front. Only the Ivy League preseason poll voters are doubtful of the Crimson’s capabilities.
In early August, Harvard was vote fourth in the Ivy League Preseason Poll, behind Yale in first, followed by Dartmouth and Princeton. Yale returns senior wide receiver Reed Klubnik, ranked fifth in the FCS last year for yards per game, averaging 114.3. Klubnik also stands as the only player of the league on the Walter Payton Award Watchlist.
Rounding out the bottom half of the preseason poll were Penn, Columbia, Cornell, and Brown, in descending order.
“My message is always we can beat anybody we play,” Murphy said. “Not because we’re entitled to beating anybody, but we work really hard, we’ve got good athletes, and we’re going to compete like hell.”
More salient than anything is the confidence of this Crimson team. The first test of that confidence comes from the West. San Diego, two games into its season, has yet to log a single victory. The goose egg in the win column does not seem to be indicative of the teams strength.
The Toreros’ two losses came from Cal Poly, and No. 4/5 UC Davis. The loss to UC Davis stands out particularly bright on the schedule due in part to the manner in which San Diego lost. A pass to running back Emilio Martinez was knocked out of his hands, in the end zone, with two seconds to play. San Diego athletics described the sequence as, “[i]nches away from one of the biggest wins in program history...”
“[The Toreros] outplayed Cal Davis and Cal Davis is the number four ranked FCS team in the country,” Murphy said.
San Diego is undoubtedly an offensive juggernaut. Quarterback Ried Sinnett already has 655 yards through the air with five touchdowns to match. His main targets are Dalton Kincade and Michael Bandy. The latter of which is a name familiar to the Harvard defensive backs, which ceded to 202 yards on 12 passes to the wideout in 2018. The Toreros averag 34.5 points per game, and 474 yards to match. Last season, the Crimson scored more than 35 points only three times.
“It all starts with defense,” Murphy said. “That’s always been my philosophy. If you can’t play defense, I don’t care how good your offense is, even in the PAC 12, you’re in big trouble. Bottom line is, you’ve got to get off the field. You’ve got to make stops. That’s going to be one of the keys to this game.
On defense, San Diego brings a physicality to their contests. One visible even from the film.
“They’re physical and they play a lot of man-to-man defense and they match pretty well,” Smith said. “I’ll be looking to see how those matchups play out. I’m ready to play some physical football with my boys.”
The two squads have met on the gridiron three times before. Harvard has won each of those contests, and has gone 7-0 against members of the Pioneer League overall. Additionally the Crimson boasts a strong advantage in season openers, winning 15 of the last 18.
“[San Diego has] good players and they’ve won 24 consecutive league games,” Murphy said. “We certainly will have a very tough opponent in our opener, 3000 miles from home.”

Now that we’re a few weeks into the semester, that shopping week “This semester I’ll wake up in time for a leisurely breakfast!” motivation is gone. Unfortunately for Quadlings, this just makes it more likely that your worst fear will come true: missing the shuttle. However, if you’re trying to get to a building north of the Science Center Plaza (hi STEM folks), congratulations! The Quad is deceptively close to the Oxford Street premises. This route is the fastest way to the science buildings, and has the added bonus of taking you through “real people Cambridge” so not everyone you see will be a harried Harvard student. It will also take you via Starbucks, if you are inclined to grab your morning joe to-go.
Step 1: Walk to the Jordans 
Yeah, that’s right, Jordan residents. You have a head start here, by maybe a couple hundred feet! (For the uninitiated, the Jordans are the satellite Pfoho buildings at the corner of Walker and Shepard, separated from the Quad proper by Walker Street) The denizens of Cabot’s I/J island, aka Eliot Hall, also are #winners by 20 seconds with this route.
Step 2: Walk down Shepard Street and turn right onto Massachusetts Ave.
Some tips: You can cross Shepard at the Mass. Ave. light, but Shepard is a one-way with little to no traffic usually. Not that we’d encourage you to jaywalk, but...if you’re running late, keep it in mind. If you want Starbucks, do not cross Shepard until the intersection.
Step 3: Cross Mass. Ave. at the Everett/Chauncy intersection
This is a big intersection that you can’t miss. The general rule is to cross first in whichever direction the light lets you, but this intersection is a bit wack. The Mass. Ave. crossing is a shorter light (around 20-30 seconds) than the Chauncy Street crossing (around 50 seconds), even though Mass. Ave is a much bigger road. Be prepared to walk fast — Boston drivers do not mess around.
Step 4: Cut through the Law School
Y’all are math nerds, so you’ll understand what we mean when we say this is some trigonometry magic. Don’t walk down Everett and Oxford because those are straight lines! The path through the Law School makes the hypotenuse. Ergo, shorter walking distance. Boom.
One potential route is to turn left into the Law School right after Wasserstein Hall (the building with the COOP), but you can also follow Everett and turn right just beyond Wasserstein’s other corner. You should end up in front of the Caspersen Student Center either way, which you can identify by the stressed law students in front of it. Pro tip: walk right through Wasserstein if it’s windy or rainy or generally unpleasant.
Step 5: Surprise! The engineering buildings!
Walk down the path that puts Hauser on your left and the Law School Library on your right. You’re here! Maxwell Dworkin is down to your far left, as is Pierce, and the physics buildings are across the lawn. Follow the path straight down, keeping the library on your immediate right, and you’ll find LISE and Gordon McKay to your left. The Science Center is just beyond, and you can go in through the side entrance to avoid the crowd.
At any point, you can walk left to hit the Oxford Street sidewalk, and cross the road to buildings like Northwest, the Chemistry department, and the Natural History museums. Congratulations, you are energized and ready to take on the day.
N.B.: This route is reversible! What’s more, it’s way faster than taking the shuttle, which will loop all the way around Mem Hall at best and the Yard at worst before getting to the Quad again.
