After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 21, 2015, at 1:12 a.m.
MINNEAPOLIS—It took two goal-line reviews, nine minutes of penalty killing, and 43 saves, but at the end of Friday night’s Frozen Four semifinal against No. 1/2 Boston College, the No. 4/4 Harvard women’s ice hockey team stood alone on the ice.
The players raised their sticks in unison, hugged each other, and then walked into the locker room in a single file, passing beneath a cheering section of Crimson fans.
Harvard (27-5-3, 16-4-2 ECAC), the same squad that lost 10-2 to the Eagles (34-3-2, 21-0-1 Hockey East) earlier this season, exited Ridder Arena as a 2-1 victor over its crosstown foes. The Crimson will return on Sunday afternoon for a national championship matchup against Minnesota, which beat fourth-seeded Wisconsin, 3-1, on the other side of the four-team bracket.
“What a hockey game,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “I’m so proud of our kids for how hard and smart they played together. We weathered a tremendous storm at the end.”
On a night of heroic performances, Crimson junior goalie Emerance Maschmeyer distinguished herself as the game-saver, stopping three shots in the final minute. This sequence included a goalmouth scrum with 19 seconds left that required Maschmeyer to fall to the bottom of the pile to make a save.
However, the defense of Maschmeyer would not have mattered without the offense of senior forward Kalley Armstrong and junior forward Mary Parker, who provided Harvard’s two scores.
Six minutes into the third period, Armstrong put the Crimson on the board with a squib of a shot that squirted beneath freshman net-minder Katie Burt, owner of the lowest goals allowed average in the nation.
“I just tried to throw some junk on the net,” Armstrong said. “I had no idea it went in…. It was a lucky, lucky bounce, and I was fortunate enough to put that away.”
If Armstrong’s score came as a surprise, then Parker’s shorthanded finish arrived after a painstaking period of anticipation. With seven minutes left in the final frame, senior defender Sarah Edney collected the puck after a faceoff in her defensive zone and pushed a shot on net. Then, with the BC defense collapsing around the crease, Parker crashed the net to put away the rebound.
Goal-line judges deliberated for several minutes, which left Harvard waiting in limbo by the team bench. But when the decision came, the team and the nearby Crimson section erupted in cheers.
The review was the second time that a debated call went the Crimson’s way. Just a minute and a half into the game, the Eagles appeared to have taken the lead on a point-blank finish from sophomore forward Kristyn Capizzano, but a review from on high reversed the call.
But the officials did not always side with the Crimson’s case. Harvard faced nine minutes of penalty time throughout the match, including a five-minute whistle on Crimson junior winger Miye D’Oench for a check from behind.
The call ejected D’Oench from the game and sent Harvard scrambling on the penalty kill. Maschmeyer recorded seven stops in the period, including an acrobatic glove save with four minutes left.
“A five-minute penalty…[is] a long penalty,” Maschmeyer said. “For me, my mindset is that it’s one shot at a time, [so] don’t think ahead. Obviously a lot can happen in five minutes.”
The Crimson received some additional help from the right post, which rejected a try from the right side in the final two minutes of the kill.
Yet neither player nor post could block BC’s first goal, which arrived with less than five minutes to play in regulation.  At the end of an offensive set for the Eagles, a rebound slid toward senior forward Emily Field, who one-timed the puck into the top corner to trim the margin to one.
Despite newfound urgency, BC could not find the same open-ice offense that it had employed throughout the game, particularly in the second period. In that frame, play opened up into a series of counterattacks, and the Eagles pinged shot after shot, ending the period with a 26-12 advantage in the statistic.
But Harvard held, even launching some mischief of its own. At 4:11, the Crimson had an apparent breakaway opportunity only to stop dead when an official dinged the team for a mistimed substitution.
At the end of the game, though, a call that hurt Harvard led to perhaps the decisive Crimson offensive sequence of the night. With 12:50 left to play, Harvard freshman forward Haley Mullins skated to the bench to serve time for an interference call. Yet, 10 seconds later, Parker and company were skating in the opposite direction—to celebrate a second goal with the team bench on the shorthanded goal.
“We got the job done,” Stone said. “We are thrilled to be playing in the final game of the season, and we’re looking forward to trying to finish the job.”

Danny Biega ’13 made his NHL debut for the Carolina Hurricanes on Thursday night in Montreal.
The former Harvard defenseman, captain, and third-round draft pick was called up from the Charlotte Checkers to play his first NHL game, in which the Hurricane’s lost, 4-0, to the Montreal Canadiens, Biega’s hometown team.
Biega recorded 14:26 minutes of ice time and a minus-2 rating. He is the third Harvard men’s hockey alum to make an NHL debut this year.
His brother, former Harvard captain and defenseman Alex Biega ’10, played seven games with the Vancouver Canucks in late February and early March, recording the game-winning goal in his first appearance on Feb. 16.
On Feb. 24, former Harvard captain and defenseman Dylan Reese ’07 played in a road game for the Arizona Coyotes.
Biega is the 28th Harvard hockey alum to play in an NHL Game. As a junior, he earned first-team All-America honors while placing second nationally among defensemen in points per game. Since turning professional, he has recorded 32 points in 130 games with Charlotte in the American Hockey League.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Jimmy Vesey's freshman season, he saw the Crimson rank last in goals in the ECAC. The next year, Harvard jumped only one spot.
That changed this season in dramatic fashion, in large part due to the efforts of the junior forward. Those outside of Cambridge have taken notice.
Before taking the ice for the ECAC Men’s Hockey Tournament semifinal matchup against No. 7/7 Quinnipiac, Vesey was named the ECAC Media Association Player of the Year.
The Nashville Predators’ draft pick has been the moving force for the No. 18/- Crimson offense this season. The junior has accounted for 28 goals and 26 assists through the first period of the team’s semifinal matchup against the Bobcats, leading the conference in goals and points. The output of the first-line—which matched him with junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo and, when healthy, sophomore Alexander Kerfoot—is a large reason why Harvard boasts the highest-scoring offense in the conference with an average of more than three-and-a-quarter goals per contest.
The forward started off the year with a 21-game point streak, which was only broken when the Crimson was shut out in its third matchup against No. 19/- Yale. He registered a point in all but three games this season.
Vesey’s output was not only large in quantity, but also timely, providing clutch goals for his team. He notched both game-winners in the ECAC quarterfinals against Yale, including the game-deciding goal in double overtime of the rubber match that sent the Crimson to Lake Placid. He also added six points in the two-game sweep of Brown in the first-round series.
This year’s campaign for the North Reading, Mass. native came after he was named to the All-Ivy League second team his sophomore season where he registered 13 goals and nine assists.
Vesey was earlier named Ivy League Player of the Year and to the All-Ivy first team for his efforts this season.
Vesey was not the only member of the Crimson to garner accolades. Fellow classmates and linemate Kyle Criscuolo was named Student-Athlete of the Year, recognizing his off-the-ice accomplishments in conjunction with his performance on the ice. The co-captain ranks fifth in goals in the conference and third in assists, many of which led to Vesey goals.
Despite his prolonged absence during the season, junior defenseman Patrick McNally was named to the second All-ECAC team for the second consecutive season. The Milton Academy graduate has averaged exactly a point per game in the 18 contests for which he has dressed this year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sports reporters don’t tell the whole truth.
Yes, we relay exact statistics; yes, we transcribe exact quotes. But when it comes to describing exactly what happens on a grassy field, an icy rink, or a hardwood floor, we whisk together a few summary phrases and advertise the product as the whole truth.
In doing so, we betray the backstory. It’s often a choice of expedience: in order to cover what occurs beneath the spotlight, you need to treat the past as periphery. This attitude may be efficient, but it also fails to explain the richness that defines big contests. Before any famous game, after all, there are anonymous hours.
The month of March accentuates this flaw of live sports journalism. You may not know what UAB stands for, but you can confirm that the UAB men’s basketball team beat Iowa State, 60-59, on some late-game heroics. The spotlight jerks from one Cinderella to the next, and sportswriters generate skeleton headlines, not full-bodied explanations.
Tonight the jumpy gazes of many sports fans will come to rest on the Harvard women’s hockey team, as it takes on Boston College in a Frozen Four national semifinal. For an hour or two, thousands of spectators will revel in a contest that feels like a stand-alone moment but is, in fact, the culmination of a long chain of events that stretches back to the beginning of the season in October, if not earlier.
The full backstories behind the event are unknown and unknowable. As a reporter or a fan, you can only caricature the years of preparation that will culminate in tonight’s contest; what we see is only a fraction of what appears on the ice.
Yet we can’t dismiss the invisible forces that have propelled the Eagles and the Crimson to the edge of a national championship. In so many ways, these histories, which are impossible to fully comprehend as outsiders, are the drivers of the intensity of events like the Frozen Four.
Nearly six months—that’s how long the Crimson’s season has lasted. That’s six months of team practices you never attended. Six months of strategy talks you never heard. Six months of private struggle you never saw—but that all still has built up to this singular moment.
Only 26 players in the world know the precise weight of the six-month burden, and these 26 will be in the Harvard locker room tonight.
Although we can’t provide an exact account of what this matchup weighs, we can at least do some guesswork. It helps that in this case, the matchup seems to weigh so much.
For senior forwards Hillary Crowe and Samantha Reber, the Frozen Four means a return home. Reber and Crowe are the only Minnesotans on the Crimson’s roster, and they inevitably must confront the pressure of playing in a familiar place in front of familiar faces.
What does this pressure actually entail? No one except the pair of natives can know for sure, but it seems probable that playing in a home state brings flashbacks of all those private actions—skating sprints, slapping shots, taping sticks—that have led up to this public moment.
“Being in my senior year now, playing for a national title in Minnesota with this group of girls, is a dream come true,” Reber said. “It just means so much more...to be playing this game here.
Crowe and Reber fall into a second category of Harvard players who must think about more than the Eagles as they ready for the semifinal matchup. The two forwards are members of a seven-person senior class, and for this group, Friday could potentially mark the last contest with the team.
This squad of seniors has overseen an impressive four-year era in Crimson hockey, one in which the squad has never finished below 20 wins in a season. One item lacking from this resume, however, is a Frozen Four appearance, and Friday’s game marks new territory for this reason.
“It’s in the back of my mind,” Reber said. “More than anything this weekend, I want to leave everything out on the ice and do everything I can to help our team get to where we want to be.
For Harvard coach Katey Stone, the game against BC means another Frozen Four experience, albeit her first since 2008. That year, the team lost to Wisconsin, 4-1, in the semifinal contest.
Stone has had an impressive run since then, including a stint as the Olympic head coach. But a second national championship would surely prove valuable to the legacy of the coach with the most wins in women’s Division I college hockey history.
“We’ve got to focus on the things that we do well,” Stone said. “If we’re going to play our game, we better remember what we value and what’s gotten us to this point.”
Of course, in order to perform at the highest level, Crimson players will try to push these large-scale thoughts to the sideline as much as possible. That’s no small task given the size of the stage.
Even if Harvard players succeeding in forgetting their various burdens, they can’t cast them off. The intensity of the Frozen Four derives from such emotional storylines, and like the game itself, the emotions belong solely to the players.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the nation stirred over college hoops and brackets, it was in St. Louis at the NCAA Wrestling Championships where another form of madness was going down.
Senior heavyweight David Ng was the lone member of the Crimson to qualify for the national tournament, after capturing 5th place at the EIWA conference championships two weeks prior.
Ng finished with a 1-2 record in St. Louis, falling in his first match to Stanford’s Nathan Butler by a score of 5-1. The loss led him to his first of two win-or-go-home pigtail matches, where the Massapequa, N.Y. native claimed a comeback victory against a familiar opponent in Columbia’s Garrett Ryan, 4-2. That win set up what would be Ng’s final match of the tournament, a 4-0 loss to conference rival Jacob Aiken-Phillips of Cornell.
“David will remember this for the rest of his life,” Crimson coach Jay Weiss said. “He fought, and he was our lone survivor with all the injuries we’ve had this season. He’s been a great wrestler for our team, and this experience is going to help him down the road.”
The senior began the tournament outside the round of 32, needing a victory against Stanford’s Nathan Butler to advance. Butler opened the scoring with an escape in the second period. Although Ng responded with an escape of his own to knot the score at one apiece in the third period, a near fall from Butler secured a late victory for the redshirt sophomore.
The bout marked Ng’s first appearance at the NCAA championships, after finishing seventh at the EIWA championships as a junior and eighth as a sophomore, just missing qualification both times. But the senior said that he was more excited than nervous heading into his first match.
“We work all year to get to this tournament,” Ng said. “It was a little unusual for me to not be anxious, but I was glad to be here and compete with the best in the country.”
The stars aligned in the first round of wrestlebacks for Ng to match up with Columbia’s Garrett Ryan.
The two wrestlers had met three times prior to their bout on Thursday. In their most recent matches, the Ivy League rivals split each bout, both ending in a score of 3-1.
Ng had previously secured qualification for the NCAA tournament by defeating Ryan, 2-0, in the fifth place match of the EIWA championships following a 3-1 loss to Ryan in the quarterfinal stage of the same tournament.
Indeed, the two wrestlers have gotten to know each other pretty well on the mat.
“I’m a smaller heavyweight, and I was able to force the match into a scramble,” Ng said. “I like to create a lot of movement, and the bigger guys have a tough time moving around so much, so I was able to maneuver my way in for a takedown.”
Although Ng trailed his Ancient Eight counterpart by one late in the third period, the senior picked up a point to tie the score at two by executing an escape. Then, with the clock winding down in the final period of regulation, Ng tallied two points from a takedown, locking up his first NCAA tournament victory.
The Ivy League pairings continued, as the senior’s triumph over Ryan led to a second round wrestleback matchup with Cornell’s Jacob Aiken-Phillips.
In Harvard’s regular season meeting with eventual EIWA team champion Cornell, Ng dominated Aiken-Phillips, earning a 6-1 win.
This time, the match would swing in Cornell’s favor. A close battle throughout, the bout remained scoreless until the third period. The Cornell senior broke the scoring drought by earning a point by escape and tallying two more shortly after with a takedown. Four points for Aiken-Phillips in the third sealed the victory for Cornell.
Ng’s swan song ended with a 21-13 season record, and the senior helped continue the 20-year streak of Harvard wrestling making an appearance at the NCAAs. His experience has provided him with valuable advice for younger teammates who will be the leaders of the wrestling squad in the coming years.
“Don’t wait until your senior year to become confident in yourself,” Ng said. “Physically, I’ve been almost the same since my freshman year, but I didn’t have that belief that I had in myself up until now. Don’t wait to be good.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
LAKE PLACID, N.Y.—By the time sophomore forward Tyler Moy split the Quinnipiac defense late in the first period, the No. 17/15 Harvard men’s ice hockey team seemed to have already dotted the i’s and crossed the t’s on its first ECAC championship game berth since 2012.
The fast-skating squad looked all too comfortable on the Olympic sheet in the early going of its 5-2 victory on Friday. A strike from newly-minted ECAC Player of the Year Jimmy Vesey got the Crimson on the board 30 seconds into the game and two goals 33 seconds apart from Moy and fourth-year forward Colin Blackwell propelled Harvard to a three-goal lead.
By the intermission, the Crimson (20-12-3, 11-8-3 ECAC) led, 3-0, and No. 7/7 Quinnipiac (23-11-4, 16-3-3) was fighting against history. Playing without top scorer Sam Anas, the regular season conference champions had not won a game after trailing by three goals since Nov. 6, 1999. The Bobcats came out of the break with a similar lethargy that they displayed in the first 20 minutes as sophomore forward Alexander Kerfoot drew Harvard’s third straight power play of the game at 7:21 in the period.
But a single slip at the blueline changed the shape of the contest. Sophomore forward Sean Malone tripped at the point to set up a shorthanded score from Quinnipiac forward Travis St. Denis, and the Bobcats began to play with renewed vigor.
Only a reversal of fortunes down the stretch would allow Harvard to hang on for its fifth ECAC semifinal win in 12 years. Vesey potted his nation-leading 29th goal into an empty net, and Malone canceled out his turnover with a 6-on-5 marker of his own to set up a Saturday evening date with No. 15/- Colgate for the Whitelaw Cup.
CALL CONTROVERSY
Late in the first period, Blackwell rocketed a top-shelf slap shot that kissed the cross-bar on its way in to give Harvard a two-goal lead. Less than two periods later, he appeared to be out for the tournament.
At 1:47 in the final frame, Quinnipiac sophomore Tim Clifton laid into Colin Blackwell with a powerful open ice hit along the right boards that sent the fourth-year forward face-down on the ice, clutching his head.
Blackwell, who has a known history of head injuries, received attention on the ice from Harvard trainer Chad Krawiec. After undergoing a preliminary health evaluation on the bench, Blackwell left for the locker room, tossing his helmet in disgust. Yet he would return with about 10 minutes left to provide important plays as Harvard clung to a one-goal lead.
“I haven’t seen the tape of it, but live, it looked like [Blackwell] took a head shot, maybe an elbow to the head,” Donato said. “I think our whole bench took a big sigh of relief when he got up, and it seems like he was doing pretty well after the game.”
Clifton, meanwhile, received a five minute major for contact to the head and a game misconduct. While his high shoulder caused Blackwell’s head to snap back, Clifton did not appear to make high contact with his elbow.
Quinnipiac coach Rand Pecknold, who did watch tape of the play after the game, expressed disappointment with the officiating.
“I thought it was a two [minute minor] live, and I thought it was a two on the replay,” Pecknold said.
Harvard’s extended power play failed to score and struggled to mount pressure, yet the stretch stymied the Bobcats’ momentum and taxed their penalty kill, which was without one of its most important assets in Clifton.
A FRESH FINALE
As Harvard closed in on the win, St. Lawrence fans waiting for the second semifinal game began to cheer for the Crimson. The Saints beat Harvard twice this year by matching scores of 5-1, and their supporters were looking for more.
“I guess it’s good we got a couple fans in the stands,” Kerfoot joked.
After a 4-3 overtime thriller in the second semifinal, St. Lawrence will not get its third crack at Kerfoot’s team. Instead, Harvard will face Colgate, a team that the Crimson swept in the regular season with convincing 6-1 and 4-1 wins.
"It's down to one game for all the marbles," Colgate coach Don Vaughan said. "Even though there's a history there, and there's not a very successful one this year against Harvard, for us, we're not going to be thinking about that. We know what we need to do."
Despite Harvard's dominance against the fourth-seeded Raiders, both finalists have experienced similar journeys this season.
In the middle of the year, both Colgate and Harvard suffered important injuries and struggled to meet early-season expectations.
And in the postseason, both teams have received important boosts from stars who suffered potentially season-ending knee injuries: Fourth-year defenseman Patrick McNally, who returned last weekend from a knee injury, anchored the Crimson’s defense in the first semifinal, and junior forward Mike Borkowski, who returned to the Raider lineup in early February after ACL surgery in November, scored the game-winner in the second semifinal.
Colgate was struck with the injury bug again on Friday, as Raider defensemen Spiro Goulakos and Brendan Corcoran left their game early with injuries. Vaughan cycled four defensemen through overtime.
“We’re going to hit the reset button [tomorrow],” Vaughan said. “We’ll probably have to take a hard look at our [defensive] corps and try to get some fresh legs in there—I think we’ll be forced to do that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
LAKE PLACID, N.Y.—Prior to Friday afternoon’s ECAC tournament semifinal game between the No. 17/15 Harvard and No. 7/7 Quinnipiac men’s ice hockey teams, Jimmy Vesey received his trophy as ECAC Player of the Year. Over the ensuing 60 minutes of hockey, the junior forward proved why he deserved the honor.
Carrying the puck behind the goal line on the game’s opening shift, Vesey threw a shot towards goal which skipped off a Bobcat defenseman and into the back of the net to put the Crimson (20-12-3, 11-8-3 ECAC) up by one just 30 seconds in. And in a contest bookended by scores from the Nashville Predators prospect, Vesey added an empty netter in the final stages of the game to send Harvard to its first ECAC championship game since 2012 with a 5-2 victory at Herb Brooks Arena.
Vesey’s goal set the tone for the first period as the Crimson jumped out to an early three-goal lead on scores from fourth-year forward Colin Blackwell and sophomore center Tyler Moy. The lead was one that would stand for the entirety of the game as the Bobcats (23-11-4, 16-3-3) were forced to play from behind for all but the first half-minute of action.
“Our overall play in the first was probably our best,” Vesey said. “That was the start we wanted, and we fed off that.”
Nonetheless, the regular season conference champion never backed down. Fighting off Harvard’s third power play of the game midway through the second, Quinnipiac got itself back into the game by capitalizing on a Crimson miscue.
After sophomore forward Sean Malone tripped over the attacking blue line, Bobcat defenseman Justin Agosta snatched the puck from the sophomore’s feet and skated out to a two-on-one with senior forward Alex Barron. Once Barron entered the lower half of the slot, Agosta dished the puck off, but rather than pulling the trigger, Barron dumped an additional pass off to junior center Travis St. Denis.
The top-liner’s first shot was sent wide, but with Crimson goaltender Steve Michalek out of position, St. Denis went behind the net to retrieve his own rebound and guided it in for Quinnipiac’s first score of the night and his 15th of the season.
Less than six minutes later, the Bobcats were at it again. With Michalek scrambling to get back to his crease after playing a puck behind his own net, junior forward Soren Jonzzon took advantage, ripping a shot through the net-minder’s five-hole to cut the Crimson’s lead to one.
“We just made a couple mistakes, and they capitalized on those,” Vesey said. “It started getting a little bit scary on the bench because they were kind of pressing us, but I think we were all happy when that buzzer went off and [we] could regroup and come back out for the third.”
Following the game, Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 proved to be in agreement with Vesey. But Donato, who will be coaching in his fifth conference championship game on Saturday, also found a way to put his team’s lead at the second intermission into perspective.
“If you had told us that we had a one-goal lead heading into the third period to make it to the championship game of our league a few months ago,” Donato began to claim, “I think we all would have taken it.”
St. Denis nearly found an equalizer multiple times in the third, including a great chance on the edge of the crease after receiving a pass from freshman forward Tanner MacMaster behind the net. Additionally, a power play following a Moy interference penalty with 8:33 remaining provided Quinnipiac with another chance to level the score.
But in accordance with tradition, the famous scoreboard of Herb Brooks Arena, which has been preserved for a number of decades, remained the same once more. The 3-2 scoreline would hold until the final two minutes of play, when Bobcat coach Rand Pecknold opted to pull goaltender Michael Garteig. Despite pressing for the game-tying goal, Quinnipiac could not beat Michalek a third time. Vesey recorded his second goal of the night and seventh of the playoffs on the empty net with 1:36 remaining, and Malone added another in the final minute to secure the win.
“[The score] got a lot closer than any of us probably would have liked,” Donato said. “But we stuck with it, made some big saves, [and] made some key plays at the end of the game to get us out of there and give us a chance to play for the championship tomorrow.”
The Bobcats’ comeback attempt came on the heels of a first period in which they could never find their rhythm. Quinnipiac approached the attacking zone several times in transition, but those chances led to turnovers and blocked shots more often than shots on target. The Bobcats generated just nine shots overall, only four of which came on net (Harvard registered 27 and 14, respectively).
Harvard added to its one-goal lead at the 14:55 mark in the first on the man advantage. After the Crimson’s first power play unit failed to generate much offense, the second unit, backed by Blackwell on the point, took to the ice.
After traffic cleared in front of the net and with the puck on his stick, Blackwell capitalized on the newly acquired space. From the top of the left faceoff circle, the forward lifted his stick and delivered a rocket into the top left corner of the net to double his side’s lead.
Blackwell has four goals in Harvard’s six postseason tilts after missing all but three of the team’s regular season games due to recurring concussion issues—issues that led everyone in attendance at Herb Brooks Arena to hold their collective breath early in the third period.
Positioned along the boards deep in his own zone, Blackwell took a hit from Bobcat forward Tim Clifton that sent the Harvard fourth-year crashing facedown to the ice clutching his head. But to the surprise of everyone in attendance at Herbs Brook Arena, Blackwell returned to the ice midway through the third, providing a constant presence on the forecheck and nearly finding the back of the net on a two-on-one chance late in the game.
“There’s a really tough balance as a coach with Colin,” Donato said. “He’s such a talented guy, and you want to see him do so well, but you also want to see him regain his health and be able to play…. Colin’s a difference-maker for us, and we’re excited that he was able to survive that.”
Moy added the third goal of the period less than a minute after Blackwell after jumping on a breakaway at center ice. Pecknold pulled Garteig following the score, but the junior would return at the start of the second, stopping each of the remaining 15 shots he saw.
But two Harvard goals on Garteig’s vacant net sealed the win in the end, setting up a championship match between the Crimson and No. 15/- Colgate on Saturday. Harvard now ranks 11th in the Pairwise and can lock up an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament with a win.
“[We've] got a great group of guys, and I think we all want [this run] to go as long as it can,” Vesey said.
