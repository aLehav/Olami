After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the Crimson claimed victory this past weekend in the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament and came just shy of earning an Associated Press Top 25 ranking earlier this week, interest in the team is at an all-time high.
Harvard’s big wins in the tournament have raised expectations for the quickly maturing team. Its recent success has raised questions about whether the Crimson (7-0) will be able to maintain this level of success the rest of the way, but it will certainy be fun to watch.
After Harvard took down Vermont on the road Thursday night, Crimson fans will have ample opportunity to cheer the team on throughout the rest of the month.
Harvard faces Seattle (4-2) on Saturday, Dec. 4, at Lavietes and takes to the road to face No. 8 Connecticut (6-1) on Thursday, Dec. 8. The Crimson will return to Boston to face Boston University (3-4) at Agganis Arena on Sunday, Dec. 11.
Tickets for Saturday’s home contest against Seattle are available at the Murr Center and are free for undergraduate students upon presentation of a valid HUID. As with all home games, remaining tickets will also be made available at the entrance of Lavietes an hour before game time.
For fans wishing to travel with the team, the Harvard Athletic Department will be sponsoring a fan bus to next Sunday’s matchup against Boston University. The bus will travel to and from Boston University’s Agganis Arena as well as supply pizza for fan bus passengers. More information can be found on the “Fan Bus to Boston University” facebook event page:
The trip to Storrs is a bit longer, and it is unlikely whether the athletic department will be providing a bus for what may be Harvard’s first game while ranked in the top 25. Tickets for the highly-anticipated game can be purchased online from StubHub.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just a few weeks into the winter sports season, three teams are undefeated and two are nationally ranked. If this is a taste of what is to come, we’ve got an exciting winter ahead of us.
5. Women’s Ice Hockey
The Crimson is 6-4 and ended a three game losing streak by defeating Dartmouth, 2-1, yesterday. The team is 6-2 in conference play and will battle Providence on Dec. 8.
4. Pool Powerhouses
The women’s swimming and diving team dominated Dartmouth and Cornell, winning 12 of 16 matches against the (not so) Big Green and (even less so) Big Red in its first action of the year. The men’s team beat the same two schools in dual meet action and recently took fifth place at the prestigious Nike Cup hosted by UNC.
3. Women’s Fencing
At the Garret Open, hosted by Penn State, the women’s fencing team won two gold medals and one bronze. The medals came in the foil, epee, and saber events, which all sound equally scary.
2. Men’s Basketball
Crimson men’s basketball players were not able to return home for the Thanksgiving break, but don’t pity them. Instead, the team traveled to the Bahamas and won the Battle 4 Atlantis. The team beat No. 20 Florida State and avoided UConn, who lost on the opposite side of the bracket. Harvard will play the No. 8 Huskies on Dec. 8 in what could potentially slide the Crimson into the national top 25 rankings.
1. Squashopolies
I’m not exactly sure how many colleges have squash teams, but national top five rankings for both the (No. 5) men and (No. 1) women are impressive in my book. The teams are a combined 7-0 and have outscored opponents 58-5. You can’t perform much better than that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College will convene a task force of students, staff, and faculty to examine the role of student input on Harvard policies, the Undergraduate Council announced in an email to the student body on Thursday.
The creation of the Task Force on Student Voice follows a series of discussions between UC leadership and the administration on ways of increasing student’s ability to make their opinions heard on campus.
“I think we really got the point across that we needed an overhaul of the way student voice is incorporated, and I think the Deans really heard that message,” outgoing UC President Senan Ebrahim said.
Last month, the Council hosted an unprecedented open meeting with Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, and President Drew G. Faust.
The Task Force will send its recommendations to Hammonds along with Faust and Smith.
“I think the UC can play an important role in facilitating student participation in University governance, with the end result being a significant enhancement of the student voice on campus,” Dean Hammonds wrote in an official letter to Ebrahim on Wednesday.
In addition to creating the Task Force, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds announced the creation of a program to help new UC members understand the structure of the Harvard administration and develop leadership and communication skills.
The Leadership Intensive will involve sessions between new UC members and administration and faculty to familiarize students with the existing channels of student influence.
“Having this intensive outright at the beginning of every term will really give UC leaders and all representatives a head start on being able to dig right into projects,” Ebrahim said.
The Task Force will help address what many students perceive as a lack of participation in official decisions at the College, according to Ebrahim.
“I think its a very commendable effort on the part of the UC to engage students in the administration,” Jonathan L. Newmark ’12, former president of the Harvard College Democrats, said. “It also reflects the progress of the University’s commitment to really reach out to the undergrads.”
Many of the details of the Task Force still have to be worked out, but Ebrahim anticipates that it will consist of around fifteen members and begin making recommendations within a year.
For now, Ebrahim and UC Vice President Bonnie Cao see the Task Force and Leadership Initiative as significant steps in achieving their campaign promise of changing the role of student voice at Harvard.
“We do consider ourselves part of a community, and we do want to be part of the direction and the vision of what the University should look like,” Ebrahim said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As College administrators look to spread class times more evenly throughout the school day, the Government Department is considering rescheduling its undergraduate seminar programs to accommodate the constrained schedules of student athletes.
Right now, almost all Government Department seminars meet once a week in the afternoon—the same time many athletic teams hold their practices.
If the proposal, supported by Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, goes forward, some seminars would meet from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m.
The plan could take effect as early as next fall.
“We have anecdotal evidence (from concentration advisers in the Houses) that conflict with afternoon commitments prevents at least some athletes from taking seminars,” Director of Undergraduates Studies Cheryl B. Welch wrote in an email.
Neither Government 90 nor Government 98, which are respectively the undergraduate seminar program and the junior seminar program in the department, are required courses for concentrators.
But seminars’ small class sizes and specialized focuses make them attractive to students in a large concentration known for its impersonal introductory classes. Approximately 80 percent of concentrators over the past five years have taken one or more seminar in their college careers, Welch wrote.
But this is a number that the department hopes to increase.
“Being flexible in scheduling is one avenue we are pursuing to make it possible for all concentrators to participate in our popular seminar program,” Welch wrote.
The department does not collect data on the number of athletes among its concentrators, according to Welch, but there is evidence to indicate that a substantial portion of the concentration is missing out on the department’s seminars due to schedule constraints.
Justin D. Gest, a college fellow in the department who is teaching an afternoon seminar, said he has seen “a few students who were unable to enroll because of a time conflict with their mandatory training or games.”
Government concentrator Aaron E. Spisak ’12, who just finished his last season as an offensive lineman on the varsity football team, said he hasn’t been able to enroll in the seminars that have interested him because they have conflicted with his practice time.
“The latest class I ever took was from 2 to 3, and I would hustle from that class to football practice,” he said.
Government concentrators on the football team, which holds practices between 3 and 6:30 every weekday afternoon, will find that only six of the more than 30 seminars listed on the departmental website do not conflict with practice.
The issue of the academic conflicts facing athletes came up at the most recent Committee on Undergraduate Education meeting on Nov. 16.
At the meeting, the committee discussed scheduling more 9 a.m. and Friday classes in the future, in order to more evenly distribute classes to give undergraduates, particularly athletes, more options.
“Athletics is something we have to work with, but I don’t think it’s an insurmountable problem,” Harris said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Discovering extraterrestrial life is not a new goal on mankind’s to-do list.
The search, of course, has traditionally played a larger role in popular culture than in the halls of academia.
But over the last 40 years, the question of whether we are alone in the universe has formed a new field in the sciences. Astrobiology, the study of life in space, is no longer relegated to the stuff of science fiction and alien enthusiasts.
“There are a lot of variables involved in knowing if there’s life out there, where it would be, and how prevalent it would be,” says Curtis C. Mead, a graduate student at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences who is involved in the search for extraterrestrials. “We think that life probably does exist.”
INTERSTELLAR RADIO CONTACT
Harvard physics professor and electrical engineer Paul Horowitz ’65 is a leading figure in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI).
The initiative is one of the first academic attempts at finding alien life. Its goal is to find intelligent alien life by using radio telescopes to detect signals emitted by alien technology.
Horowitz, who received his Ph.D in Physics at Harvard in 1970, says SETI began in 1960 with scientist Frank Drake, also a doctoral alum of the Harvard Astronomy Department. At the time, Drake was searching for interstellar radio waves from nearby stars as part of Project Ozma, based in Green Bank, West Virginia.
Horowitz’s own involvement with SETI began in 1978 with his work at the Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico, the world’s biggest single-dish radio telescope.
Today Horowitz, a physics professor by day, has become something of a figurehead for SETI. On Tuesday, he gave a lecture at the MIT Museum on SETI’s research as part of a series on life in the universe.
He says he is constantly looking for new support. NASA had initially funded SETI, but the initiative is now completely private, dependent on prominent donors like the founders of telecommunications company Cisco Systems and the Planetary Society, a space exploration advocacy group.
“For something that could potentially yield the greatest discovery in human history, it isn’t getting very much resources,” Horowitz says.
So far, no signals have been detected by SETI that are strong or long enough to be confirmed as artificial in origin, says Horowitz. But he says the search is far from over.
Though an interstellar conversation could never exist on human time scales due to sheer distance, Horowitz says he hopes to at least detect a one-way signal. Detectors must continue to work simultaneously, he says, to compensate for how short and intermittent the signals can be.
When that signal arrives—and Horowitz says “when” and not “if”—he predicts an immediate frenzy to translate the signal. “I expect it would be on the front page of the newspaper for an entire week ... The new obsession will be the message,” he predicts.
But the time scale, even for Horowitz, is unclear.
“We’ve had this technology for about a century. That’s about zero on the time scale of geologic history,” Horowitz observes.
For now, Horowitz’s graduate student, Mead, is taking up the intergalactic mantle. Mead is now working on improving SETI’s All-Sky Optical Telescope to be 100 times more powerful and extend detection into the infrared.
NAYSAYERS
Not everyone holds such confidence in finding intelligent life on distant planets.
Benjamin M. Zuckerman of the UCLA Astronomy Department represents one of the strongest academic voices in the camp of extraterrestrial naysayers.
Zuckerman, who completed his doctoral thesis in astronomy at Harvard in 1968, recognizes in his book “Extraterrestrials: Where Are They?” that there is no evidence intelligent life exists. And if it did, he says, why haven’t they contacted us yet?
Zuckerman’s path toward skepticism was borne out of unfulfilled aspirations. At Harvard, Zuckerman worked down the hall from Astronomy Department Assistant Professor Carl Sagan, famous for bridging science into popular culture through works such as the Hollywood film “Contact” and his hit TV show “Cosmos.”
The two scientists frequently discussed the prospects of finding extraterrestrial life, and Sagan’s dream of proving that man is not alone among the stars eventually rubbed off on Zuckerman. In the 1970s, Zuckerman canvassed the cosmos for intelligent life using radio telescopes in the hopes that a signal from otherworldly technology could be detected. Today, after years of fruitless searching, Zuckerman says he no longer believes that there are other planets with detectable intelligent life, at least in the Milky Way Galaxy.
He considers himself “agnostic” as to whether planets have lower life forms, such as microbial organisms and what may be comparable to animals and plants on Earth. The existence of these types of life forms, he says, is more difficult to refute because the argument that they would have intentionally contacted earth is irrelevant.
RISE OF THE EXOPLANET
Astronomy professor David Charbonneau, who received his Ph.D. in astronomy from Harvard in 2001, is one of the world’s leading experts on exoplanets, planets that orbits stars outside our own solar system. He is also the director of undergraduate studies for the Harvard Astronomy department and a researcher at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
And Charbonneau says that within three years, man will likely discover habitable planets on which life could thrive.
“What I will tell [my students] in the first lecture is, ‘If you’re a freshman, you will probably be an undergraduate at Harvard when you hear about the discovery of the first habitable exoplanets.’ It’s really going to happen.”
Charbonneau says his research into exoplanets is driven primarily by the question: “Can we find an analogue of the Earth?”
When an exoplanet comes between its star and Charbonneau’s telescopes, it creates an interstellar eclipse that reveals the planet’s potential for life. Based on the amount of light that is blocked by the eclipse and the properties of the incoming light, researchers can calculate the planet’s density and atmospheric composition to check whether it’s habitable. And if the planet is in the so-called “Goldilocks Zone,” the range of orbital distances within which a planet is not too hot or cold, there may just be life.
Charbonneau’s approach is gaining wide-spread support. The Kepler Mission is a NASA-based program with the goal of finding Earth-like exoplanets. The Kepler space observatory was launched in the spring of 2009 and is expected to have results by late 2012. Charbonneau, who is also a member of the Kepler team, is confident that Kepler’s results will be positive. “If they’re out there, Kepler’s going to find them,” he says.
Charbonneau recognizes that his goals are not as ambitious as those of SETI—a confirmed extra-terrestrial radio signal. “They’re sort of in this one quadrant of very high risk, very high return science,” he says.
But he believes that, ultimately, the differing methods are two sides of the same coin.
“SETI and [the exoplanet] approach are very similar in terms of what they want to do, but they’re totally different in terms of underlying assumptions,” he says. “SETI requires intelligent life interested in communicating and interested in radio telescopes. The path we’re advocating is basically that there are inevitable things that life does to the atmosphere.”
He continues, “There was no intent to change the atmosphere on the part of photosynthetic bacteria billions of years ago; it’s just an inevitable consequence of their daily activities.”

Famous musician and philanthropist Lionel Richie will be visiting Harvard on Monday to receive the 2011 Harvard Foundation Peter J. Gomes Award.
The reception, which we be held in Kirkland House, will highlight Richie’s humanitarian efforts over the past few decades.
“Lionel Richie has been very active in humanitarian causes,” said S. Allen Counter, director of the Harvard Foundation. “It is an honor for us to have him here.”
The humanitarian award has been given annually for more than 30 years.
The award honors the life and work of Reverend Peter J. Gomes, who died this past February.
Each year, students and faculty of the Harvard Foundation nominate and vote for the recipient. The Foundation strives to honor individuals whose work has improved the quality of life of others and inspired the world, according to the Harvard Foundation’s press release.
Past years have honored Thorbjørn Jagland, chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, actor James Earl Jones, and Dolores C. Huerta, co-founder of the United Farm Workers of America, among others.
Richie was chosen because of his musical genius and his humanitarian work, according to the release. Some of his accomplishments include co-writing the song “We Are the World” with the late Michael Jackson to benefit hunger victims in Africa. It was later used to raise funds for the victims of the earthquake in Haiti. He has also served as an advocate for breast cancer research.
Richie is expected to arrive on campus Dec. 5. He will visit Memorial Church, where he will speak with students and members of the church staff, Counter said.
Then Richie will head to Kirkland House to attend a reception. Finally, he will attend a dinner and ceremony where he will receive the award.
“The students from the Harvard Foundation will pay tribute to his life’s humanitarian work,” Counter said.
This tribute will include a number of performances by Harvard students.
“I am excited to see the ways in which Mr. Richie appreciates the performances of cultural student groups and what he has to say during the question and answer portion of our dinner,” Abdul A. Ly ’13, co-director of the event and a Harvard Foundation intern, wrote in an email.
Other student interns at the Harvard Foundation said they are excited for Richie’s visit.
“I think it’s a great event. It has been a wonderful opportunity for the Foundation to bring such great individuals to campus,” said Bronwen B. O’Herin ’12, a Harvard Foundation intern. “It is always a great chance to showcase these people.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School Professor Emeritus Abraham Zaleznik, a well-known authority on social psychology and leadership, died Monday. He was 87.
Zaleznik, who had been a faculty member at the Business School for more than four decades, authored over 16 books and 40 articles pertaining to innovation and business leadership.
Professor Joseph L. Bower, a colleague of Zaleznik’s during his years teaching at the Business School, said that Zaleznik’s interest in the psychodynamics of leadership heavily influenced his decision to question the conventional understanding of business management as a formulaic science.
“After training for nearly ten years to become a psychoanalyst, he made a very significant impact on the treatment of management and leadership as a behavioral science through his research,” he said.
Bower added that while Zaleznik’s research was initially received with doubt by other management faculty, it has had a lasting impact on the development of business education.
“Many of his most important contributions were made in the 1950s when he worked on the development of the ideas at the basis of the field that we now call human relations,” Bower said. “Today we have an elective course in the second year that probably two thirds of students take called 'Authentic Leadership,' and many of the ideas that you find in his work show up in that course.”
During his time at the Business School, Zaleznik developed very popular elective courses in “Social Psychology of Management” and “Psychodynamics of Leadership.” Both classes sought to explain the principles of business management through case studies related to the elements of Freudian psychology and human behavior.
Born in Philadelphia in 1924, Zaleznik began his college education by working during the day and taking night classes at the University of Pennsylvania. After enlisting in the U.S. Navy, he was sent via the Navy’s V12 program, a training system for officers, to Alma College in Michigan, where he graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa with a degree in economics.
In 1947, he received his MBA with distinction from Harvard Business School, where he had spent some time during World War II as a member of the Midshipmen-Officers’ program.
Ira H. Zaleznik, Professor Zaleznik’s son, said that his father was well-known for his high personal standards.
“He was always committed to excellence, and he strived for excellence in his own life and wanted the best for his children and grandchildren,” he said.
Zaleznik recalled that his father often took his children along with him on his international journeys.
“He had to work and he had to teach and we got the benefit of it,” he said. There were four summers where we literally went around the world. We went on incredible travels and had incredible experiences.”
Professor Zaleznik was appointed the Business School’s first Cahners-Rabb Professor of the Social Psychology of Management in 1967 after having served as a research assistant while earning his doctorate in commercial science and a certification by the American Psychoanalytic Association in 1971 as a clinical psychoanalyst.
Zaleznik’s wife of 66 years, Elizabeth Aron, a social psychologist as well, died in 2009. He is survived by a daughter, Dori, of Newton, Mass., and a son, Ira, of Lexington, Mass.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
L. Fred Jewett ’57, a longtime Harvard administrator who served as Dean of the College and Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid, died Sunday at age 75.
His decades-long Harvard career took him from earning four degrees to serving as a freshman proctor to eventually filling the highest administrative office at the College. At every stage, Jewett was known for forging strong personal relationships with undergraduates and promoting diversity in the student body.
“Fred Jewett was a pillar of the College for more than a generation,” University President Drew G. Faust said in a statement Thursday. “He profoundly shaped the undergraduate experience and was dedicated to opening Harvard to the most talented students, regardless of background. I’m deeply saddened by his loss.”
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 recalled Jewett’s “blazing intelligence.”
“He was a good person to have on your side if you’re playing Trivial Pursuit,” Fitzsimmons said. “His knowledge really went across the board. Talk about someone who was a polymath=he was it.”
Jewett graduated from the College magna cum laude and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He went on to receive two degrees from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and another from the Business School.
Colleagues recalled that as an administrator, Jewett focused on issues of social justice like expanding admissions to students from disadvantaged backgrounds, integrating women into Harvard, and diversifying the upperclassman Houses.
“Fred’s vision and leadership did much to create today’s Harvard,” Fitzsimmons said.
When Jewett arrived at the College, there were fewer than a hundred students of color per class—a number he sought to increase in his role in the admissions office, according to Harvard Foundation Director S. Allen Counter.
Fitzsimmons said, “He cared deeply about ensuring that Harvard be accessible to outstanding students from all ethnic and economic backgrounds.”
His focus on equality extended to gender as well. He oversaw the integration of Harvard and Radcliffe’s admissions offices, a key step toward equal treatment of men and women at the University, according to former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68.
According to his niece Megan E. Jewett ’86, her uncle’s passion for creating a more egalitarian admissions process was sparked by his personal experience coming to Harvard from what she described as “a very, very modest situation.”
As Dean of the College in the mid-1990s, Jewett played an instrumental role in the randomization of the upperclassmen housing lottery, a move intended to increase diversity in each House.
“His interest was in the welfare of the students,” said neuroscience professor John E. Dowling ’57, who was Master of Leverett House at the time and had known Jewett since their undergraduate days together. “He really understood Harvard and the value of the Houses.”
Jewett was an avid supporter of Harvard athletics, even accompanying teams on road trips.
“We were not just a team he enjoyed watching, but rather we were a bunch of individuals that he knew, admitted, and watched grow over a four-year period,” said Bobby Hackett ’81, an Olympic silver medalist in swimming.
Jewett’s concern for students extended far beyond the playing field.
“At one dinner in his honor, one student recounted how Dean Jewett’s strength was in his small gestures,” recalled Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67. “If one student was wavering in his commitment to Harvard, he would take the student out for a burger at Bartley’s.”
Longtime friend and Harvard Alumni Association leader John P. Reardon Jr. ’60 said that even when Jewett was working in the admissions office, apart from the daily life of the College, he made a point of interacting with undergraduates.
“I doubt that in his time that anybody knew as many college kids as he did,” Reardon said. “In admissions, he’d remember everything. If he met a student for the first time in the Yard, he’d tell them everything they wanted to know about themselves.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Channeling the ideas of his newly-released book, Graduate School of Education professor Howard E. Gardner ’65 stressed that modern education must incorporate “truth, beauty, and goodness.”
Gardner, who published his book “Truth, Beauty, and Goodness Reframed” this spring, spoke Thursday night at a packed Askwith Forum at the Ed School.
“We have to somehow knit together enlightenment for the 21st century,” he said.
Gardner, who is known for his theory of multiple intelligences that describes the different methods in which people process information, applied his theory to teaching in a K-12 setting. He said schools must teach students three primary skills: to discern fact from fiction, hold convictions about beauty, and become moral citizens.
“He said that the world is going to be saved by good people, not smart people,” Ed School Dean Kathleen McCartney said. “I think that’s a very provocative thought that is sure to spur a lot of conversation.”
Gardner said that academics today are concerned that younger generations value morality less than in the past.
“Over and over again we heard a litany that was very troubling,” Gardner said. “What we heard from so-called best and the brightest was, ‘We want to succeed ... and we’re in competition with other people.’”
Gardner added that, in a world in which every career holds ethical dilemmas, answers cannot always be found in books. Instead, he said, answers are best found through shared experiences. Educators today must “help young people develop ethical muscles,” he said.
Gardner also stressed the importance of determining truth. Making his point, he invoked comedian Stephen Colbert’s sarcastic notion of “truthiness” that exists in society today: if an idea is stated with enough conviction or popularity, it becomes truth regardless of the facts.
Instead, Gardner said that each field of study must teach the correct methodology of determining what is truth. In journalism, specifically, he said that students must be taught that certain forms of media, such as blogs, cannot be assumed to be factual.
“More and more of education needs to focus on the methods people use in order to make the assertions that they do,” he said.
McCartney said that she hopes Gardner’s ideas are implemented in the Ed School’s curriculum.
“We work really hard to create a moral community,” she said.

The Harvard men’s basketball team certainly didn’t leave its defense in the Bahamas.
For the fourth straight game, the Crimson held its opponent to fewer than 50 points, picking up a 55-48 win over Vermont Thursday night in front of a full house at Patrick Gymnasium despite a less-than-stellar offensive performance.
In its first game since winning the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament in the Caribbean Saturday, Harvard held the Catamounts over 20 points below their season average and to 35 percent shooting from the field.
The Crimson turned the ball over 15 times and shot 35 percent from the field in the second half.
“Our defense has been able to win games for us—no question about it,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “Our kids have been able to dig in and get stops for us when we need them. Our defense has been outstanding.”
Following a second-half run that pulled the Catamounts within 41-39 with 9:03 left, the Crimson’s defense came up big down the stretch.
Harvard (7-0) held Vermont (4-3) to just nine points on 3-of-15 shooting over the final nine minutes of play.
The Crimson was led offensively by co-captain Keith Wright and sophomore Laurent Rivard, who combined for 25 points, albeit on 9-of-19 shooting.
“We didn’t finish,” said Amaker, whose squad shot 6-of-17 from the field and 1-of-6 from deep in the second half.  “We’re not going to look very good and play very well if we don’t shoot better.” The Crimson fared better offensively in the first half, posting 36 points on 14-of-23 attempts from the field and a deadly 4-of-7 from beyond the arc.
Junior forward Kyle Casey led Harvard’s offense in the early going, posting all of his eight points in the opening frame.Thanks to its hot shooting and stifling defense, the Crimson went into the half up, 36-26.
Coming out of the break, Harvard extended its lead to as many as 13 with 17:34 to play but then hit a cold spell, bricking its next six attempts from the field.
The Catamounts capitalized. After missing its first four field-goal attempts to open the second period, Vermont started to hit. Catamounts’ freshman guard Four McGlynn got the ball rolling for the home team, sticking a triple from the top of the key to pull Vermont within nine with 14:41 to go.
Crimson freshman Jonah Travis was whistled for an offensive foul on the other end, returning the ball to the Catamounts. On the ensuing possession, McGlynn stepped up again, this time driving to the basket and banking it in off the glass.
After a badly missed three-pointer from Casey, McGlynn scored his third basket in 77 seconds, draining a triple from the right wing.
Following a Rivard miss and a Christian Webster turnover, the ball was back in Vermont’s hands. This time, Ben Crenca stepped up for the Catamounts, finishing a put-back layup to put Vermont within two, 39-37.
“We had trouble guarding the ball a little bit,” Rivard said. “They blew by us a couple times. It was a little too easy.”
Harvard’s lead hovered at two for the next three minutes of play, as the teams traded baskets. But after Sandro Carissimo’s jumper made it 41-39 Harvard with 9:03 to go, the Crimson began to get stops and hit shots.
Wright and junior point guard Brandyn Curry scored on the Crimson’s next two possessions, and Wright put Harvard up by seven with a free throw.
After Vermont’s Brian Voelkel turned it over, the Crimson took the ball the other way. Curry skipped a pass to Rivard on the right wing, and the sophomore buried the shot to put Harvard ahead, 49-39, less than three minutes after Carissimo’s shot.
“Kind of vintage Laurent with a big shot, a big dagger,” said Amaker of Rivard, who was playing in front of nearly 50 friends and family who made the two-hour trip from his native Quebec to the game. “Certainly he’s done it again for us.”
The Crimson’s lead never dipped below four the rest of the way, and Harvard delivered Vermont its eighth defeat at Patrick Gymnasium in its past 43 games.
“We knew it was going to be a tough game,” Amaker said. “Very pleased with us to be able to get a win in this environment against a team that we knew had a lot thrown into this one.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduates looking to show their support for the still undefeated Harvard men’s basketball team can take a free bus ride to the game against Boston University on Dec. 10.
Unable to secure enough tickets to justify sending fan buses to the game at the University of Connecticut on Dec. 8, the Athletics Department and the People of the Crimson—an official fan organization—instead plan to sponsor buses to the BU game.
One hundred and fifty tickets to the game will be made available to Harvard undergraduates at the ticket office in the Murr Center beginning 9 a.m. on Dec. 6. The free tickets will cover the cost of food before the game, transportation to and from the game, and entrance into the game at BU’s Case Gymnasium.
“I know there is that inner-city rivalry, so it should be a good game,” People of the Crimson President Hugh D. Archibald ’12 said. “People are really excited to come out and get involved.”
Archibald originally met with Harvard athletics officials on Tuesday to discuss organizing fan buses to the UConn game. However, the Athletics Department discovered that due to the small size of the venue, UConn’s Athletics Department did not reserve a block of tickets for visiting Harvard students and fans.
UConn uses two stadiums for their home games and plans to play Harvard in the smaller stadium on campus, according to Harvard officials.
There is heightened interest about the game against UConn, the defending NCAA national champions, because the Huskies are the only ranked team on Harvard’s schedule this season. It is also likely to be the only game during the regular season in which Harvard is not favored to win.
“That’s a bummer that [Harvard students] won’t be able to come to the UConn game because it’s going to be a pretty big game,” Harvard men’s basketball co-captain Keith A. Wright ’12 said. “Getting the chance to see your team play a team that won a national championship, a team that’s in a big conference—of course, fans would be excited for that.”
But due to the logistical issues presented by the game at UConn, an alternative trip to the BU game was proposed.
“The road trip [to BU] made a lot of sense because the game will be televised on the New England Sports Network, and we can get a block of tickets because they are playing in a big arena,” said Associate Director of Athletics Susan D. Byrne. “It will be a tough match up and the basketball team will appreciate the student support. We will try to take away the home court advantage from BU.”
After their meeting on Tuesday, the Harvard Athletics Department and the People of the Crimson gauged student interest in fan buses to BU, eventually deciding late this week there would be enough interest to justify the initiative.
Although the game against BU is not as highly anticipated as the one against UConn, Archibald is confident students will still be excited for this opportunity.
“With how well the team is playing and the turn out we had for the MIT game—we filled up the student section without any publicity—I think that will hold,” Archibald said. “People were really excited to come out and get involved. I think a lot of people will be interested in this too.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard HIV/AIDS activists, donning bathing suits and carrying an inflatable pool, staged a protest Thursday morning calling on the pharmaceutical company Merck to join the Medicines Patent Pool.
The “pool party,” which coincided with World AIDS Day, urged Merck to join the program that is designed to reduce the costs of AIDS drugs in developing countries.
About 20 members of the Harvard College Global Health and AIDS Coalition, including both undergraduates and medical students, chanted and held signs outside of a pharmaceutical conference held at the Westin Copley Place Hotel starting around 8:30 a.m. A smaller group of students entered the conference earlier that morning to pass out flyers and ribbons to conference attendees and reconvened with the main group after being asked to leave by hotel security.
“This is a less aggressive infiltration,” said Alyssa Yamamoto ’12, an organizer of the demonstration.
“We’re more trying to be informative than invasive,” she added.
Protesters speculated that conference officials seemed to have previous knowledge of the demonstration, as hotel entrances were well-staffed with police officers and security officials. At one point, two officers emerged from the hotel and asked demonstrators to clear the steps in front of the main entrance.
“Merck knows about our campaign,” said Yamamoto, adding that she thought Merck held “internal conversations” about the previous demonstrations carried out by Harvard AIDS activists. Yamamoto added that after sustained pressure from the coalition, Merck agreed to meet with them in January 2012.
Harvard AIDS activists said they hope the meeting will increase pressure on Merck to relinquish patents on several of its HIV/AIDS drugs to the Medicines Patent Pool. The Pool opens up patented drugs to generic producers for sale in developing countries and compensates the original patent holders with royalties.
“We recognize that pharmaceutical companies are not solely responsible for solving the AIDS crisis, but there is a special role for these drug owners because drug prices in the developing world directly impact the availability of critical medicines,” said protester Nathan T. Georgette ’13, who wore swim trunks over his khaki slacks and sports coat.
Organizers planned Thursday’s protest to fall on World Aids Day, observed every year on Dec. 1.
“Typically, World Aids Day is a day of remembrance and mourning,” said Yamamoto. “We want to make sure it also sounds a call for action.”
Protesters maintained that Merck’s participation in the patent pool would have a dramatic impact on reducing AIDS mortality in developing countries.
“Lots of people throw around the term ‘life-saving’, but these medications literally save lives,” said Arjun A. Suri ’08, a Harvard Medical School student who sported a lab coat, stethoscope, and swim trunks. “They turn HIV from a death sentence into a manageable chronic illness.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the outside observer, his lifejacket color and wristwatch appear to be all that separate Harvard freshman sailor Brian Drumm from his identical twin Michael.
But differentiating the two is not as difficult as one might think, given that they compete on separate boats—having done so since high school—and may, at any given moment, excel at a variety of roles for the Crimson.
“They’re both capable of skippering and crew,” Crimson coach Michael O’Connor said, “and we have to place a higher priority on getting as many good skippers on our race course as we can for every practice.”
For the versatile Drumms, spending time apart on the water has, in fact, helped develop a competitive edge.
During practices, the brothers motivate each other to constantly improve. And when they sail at different times during regattas, they take every opportunity to exchange information and give each other advice.
The Drumms are also not afraid to openly express their emotions towards each other—which, after all, might make sailing on the same boat a fairly bad idea.
“We helped push each other when we were on different boats,” Brian said. “We express our opinions more with each other than with other people, so if we get angry at each other—if we get a little frustrated—then we let the other one know that we’re frustrated.”
Whatever the Drumm brothers have been doing, it seems to be working so far, as each has found success in top-level regattas in their freshman fall.
Their accomplishments include a second-place finish for Brian in the A Division at the Atlantic Coast Championship in mid-November, and an eighth-place finish for Michael in the B Division of the Sherman Hoyt Trophy in late October.
Though their personal connection obviously began at birth, it has only been furthered through sailing.
The Drumms first got on the water  at the age of five in Marblehead, Mass., a hotbed for the sport.
During the fall and spring seasons, the Drumm twins sailed on the Marblehead High School sailing team, leading their squad to a state championship as senior co-captains. In the summers, they competed individually as they travelled to regattas throughout the country.
But earlier this year, it had seemed that the twins would finally part ways when they headed off to college. Though both were accepted at Harvard and MIT, Brian was set to join the Crimson, while Michael planned on sailing with the Engineers. A visit to Cambridge in April, however, persuaded Michael to spend another four years on the water with his brother.
“I was actually really set on going to MIT,” Michael said. “I thought I was gonna go to MIT, but then after Visitas, I changed my mind.”
The choice to remain together is likely just one component in the twins’ collegiate success.
“I’m sure that it has helped them in some ways, but I’m also sure that if they had split up they would both be doing just fine,” O’Connor said. “They have made a big impact on our team. Their athleticism has really enabled them to adapt the boat handling to the collegiate style.”
If there is one downside to the presence of the Drumm twins on the sailing team, it might just be the confusion created when people try to tell them apart. Their different-colored lifejackets and Brian’s timepiece have helped to distinguish the two, but there are still mix-ups.
“Now they’re starting to get the hang of it,” Michael said. “But not really.”
“We tried pretty hard early on to find clues to tell them apart and have had pretty good success with it,” O’Connor added. “There are still times where my system doesn’t work, but rarely does that happen on the water.”
The most important similarity between the twins is their mutual satisfaction in deciding to sail for the squad on this end of the Charles.
“I love it,” Michael said. “I definitely think I made the right choice. It’s pretty awesome here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mo-vember, the month-long mustaches-against-prostate-cancer charity event is sadly over for the Harvard men’s hockey team (3-3-2, 2-3-2 ECAC), which means that the team will take to the ice for Friday night’s game against the University of Massachusetts (4-7-3) mustache-less for the first time since October.
“When you walked in the locker room there were just a lot of smiles with handlebar mustaches,” junior forward David Valek said. “It definitely raised the energy in the locker room. Maybe that helped on the ice.”
But even with the shave, Valek said that “the atmosphere definitely hasn’t dropped.”
All ‘mo’nsense aside, the team is focusing in on the game ahead, and the Minutemen are definitely not going to be push-overs.
“They have a very fast team,” Valek said. “They have three or four guys that can really fly, so we have to try and keep them ahead of us at all times.”
In addition to their speed, UMass has also built up a strong home-ice advantage. The Minutemen have yet to lose at home this season, despite welcoming several high ranking opponents to the Mullins Center.
On Nov. 5, they defeated Boston College, 4-2, which was ranked No. 1 at the time. The following week they routed Holy Cross and Northeastern in front of their home crowd.
“We’re going to focus on not getting overexcited,” freshman defenseman Patrick McNally said. “We know [UMass] has a strong home crowd so we’ll just have to keep our composure.”
Valek echoed his teammate’s concerns.
“We have to play smart early on to get the crowd out of the game,” Valek said. “Hopefully we can draw a penalty early to give us the edge on a power play.”
But perhaps the Mullins Center itself may have something to do with their flawless home record.
Beyond the boisterous UMass crowds, the Crimson will also have to worry about the rink itself.
While most rinks in North America are about 200 ft by 85 ft in dimension, the ice at the Mullins center stretches 200 ft by 95 ft. This is because the Mullins Center was designed closer to Olympic standards (200X98) than those of the National Hockey League (200X85). Harvard’s Bright Center is slightly off the mark as well, sitting at 204 ft by 87 ft. But the difference will still be noticeable.
In light of this, the team has set aside some practice time this week to look at how rink size may affect the way the game is played. And how to adapt.
“It’s a little bigger so we’ve been watching a lot of game film,” senior forward Eric Kroshus explained. “We have to figure out how it’s going to affect our game.”
If the Crimson can minimize the role the rink plays, Harvard will be looking at much better odds at coming away with a victory. UMass’s away record stands at 0-7-2, exposing some serious vulnerabilities.
The Crimson, meanwhile, seems to have continued on the scoring streak that kicked in toward the end of last season.
In the final 12 games of the 2010-2011 season, the Crimson scored 39 goals, for an average of 3.25 goals per game, a remarkable improvement over the first part of the season when the team only scored 40 goals in 23 games, just under two per game.
So far Harvard’s 2011-2012 offensive assault has built upon the improvements of last year, tallying a goal-per-game average of just over 3.77 though nine games.
These numbers may be crucial against the Minutemen, as they have lost all six games in which their opponents scored four or more goals.
The match against UMass will also give the Crimson a break from ECAC action and a chance to work on specific aspects of its game that need improvement.
“We’ve kind of struggled so far on the rushes,” Valek said. “We always leave a couple of goals on the table with the 3s on 2s, but hopefully we can get those going.”
Despite the break from league play, the team is determined to win and very aware that the Minutemen will be a tough opponent.
“We’re going to try and play a more physical game, give them the checks a lot,” Valek added. “That should help take away from their speed and ability. Also they like to play an exchange game, kind of going back and forth with goals and we can’t afford to do that.”

A former Harvard fellow and internet activist facing federal charges for allegedly hacking into the MIT network and unlawfully downloading nearly 5 million academic articles pleaded not guilty Wednesday to similar charges brought against him by the Middlesex County District Attorney’s office, according to his attorney Martin G. Weinberg.
Aaron Swartz, a 25-year-old Cambridge resident, was arraigned in Middlesex Superior Court in Woburn, charged with breaking and entering, larceny, and unauthorized access to a computer network, according to a press release by the District Attorney’s Office.
Swartz is accused of creating a fake identity to access the MIT network last September and illegally downloading more than 4.8 million articles from JSTOR, a nonprofit academic database. Swartz allegedly took steps to evade having his network access terminated by MIT and JSTOR, including the use of multiple IP addresses, hard-wiring a computer to the MIT network, and using file grabbing programs designed to circumvent JSTOR’s security system.
Swartz was apprehended on January 6 after initially fleeing from police.
But Weinberg maintains his client’s innocence.
“His conduct cannot be criminalized by any proper and constitutional application of any of the statutes at issue,” Weinberg wrote in an email to The Crimson. “I look forward to defending him.”
Swartz is part of a growing online movement that argues that information on the internet should be shared under open access agreements. Such positions have in recent years brought open access advocates into conflict with industry groups who seek to keep their products protected under copyright.
In July, Swartz was arraigned on federal charges of fraud and unlawfully obtaining information from and damaging a protected computer in a separate case brought by federal authorities that stems from the same alleged incident.
He was indicted by a Middlesex County grand jury on Nov. 17.
A Middlesex Superior Court released Swartz after his arraignment without having to post bail on the condition that the defendant surrender his passport.
Last academic year, Swartz briefly served a stint as a fellow at the Harvard University Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics. According to a University spokesperson, Swartz’s 10-month fellowship ended in June.
Swartz has been active in technology-related and political circles. He founded the start-up Infogami, which was acquired by Reddit, a popular site that aggregates websites. He is also a director of Demand Progress and a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, two liberal political groups.
Swartz is scheduled to return to the Middlesex court for a pretrial conference date on January 3. There is no trial date set for either of the charges, according to Weinberg.
Both Swartz and a spokesperson from MIT declined to comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since my first winter at Harvard, I have been trying to figure out what that thing is. A wintry swirl? A whirlpool? A spiral galaxy? As a freshman, I lived on the first floor of Strauss Hall, where I had a direct view from my bedroom window of the garish, light-up tapestry suspended over Mass. Ave. At first, I couldn’t figure why it was there or what it was for. Perhaps an astronomy convention was in town, and the Square had been accordingly festooned with a luminous, Milky Way mural? Or, perhaps it was there to commemorate the anniversary of some important, astronomical discovery?
I swiftly realized that neither theory could adequately account for the existence of the multicolor maelstrom outside of my window, for it was not alone. Over Brattle St. now dangled, inexplicably, a pair of lopsided stars adjoined to what appeared to be bass clefs, and over JFK St. loomed a fourth-grader’s—or perhaps a precocious four-year-old’s—badly-drawn pentagram.
I soon dared to think the impossible: could these be…Christmas decorations?
I should mention at this point that I do not buy into Fox News’ annual hysteria over the imaginary “War on Christmas.” To begin with, I am not a Christian, and Christmas for me has always been less about gold, frankincense, and myrrh and more about Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Christmas specials. Moreover, while I do see an outrageous double standard in the permissibility of menorahs but not crèches at Christmastime, I understand that as the religion of the historically empowered majority, Christianity, fairly or not, is often held to a different standard from that to which minority faiths are held. And frankly, I would have been shocked far more by the sight of a Nativity scene in Cambridge than that of a menorah or kinara.
However, one would imagine that less controversial would be the more nonreligious trappings of the holiday season, like Santa Claus and snowmen. But even these decidedly secular icons are in short supply in the Square. Granted, if one pursues them doggedly enough, one can stumble upon a Christmas tree here or some Christmas lights there, or perhaps even glimpse the rather meager wreathes and ribbons hidden atop the lampposts. In theory, the comparative scarcity of these things could be defended as the outcome of aesthetic restraint; after all, it would hardly be reasonable of me to complain about the dearth of kitsch in the Square.
But the presence of these solstice curtains—or whatever they are—destroys whatever case could have been made to argue that aesthetic restraint is the guiding principle of Harvard Square’s Yuletide décor; in fact, these lights are just as gaudy—if not gaudier—than elves, reindeer, and boughs of holly. Furthermore, an active decision was made to ornament the Square in this ridiculous way, so while it would be possible to read nothing into the relative absence of traditional, secular ornamentation, it is impossible to make nothing of the presence of this spectacularly nontraditional, secular ornamentation.
Easily the most noticeable characteristic of these lights is that they are not just non-celebratory but aggressively non-celebratory. They certainly have nothing to do with Christmas in either its original, religious manifestation or its modern, commercialized iteration. Nor do they have anything to do with Hanukkah, in spite of the blue and white hues of the vortex over Mass. Ave. Nor do they seem to commemorate any make-believe holidays like Festivus. What is most striking, however, is that they are not even seasonally themed; there is nothing exceptionally wintry about flaccid stars and amorphous swirls.
In fact, unless the misshapen pentacle over JFK St. is actually an upturned Satanic symbol (perhaps an ultimate rebuke of the Christian origins of the holiday season), or all three images somehow pertain to some long-lost winter solstice festival like Saturnalia or Modranect, the lights do not appear to signify anything at all. They are purely abstract, little more than three pieces of bad, contemporary art draped over the city at the expense of its aesthetic appeal. If this is the case, then it begs the question: Why bother putting them up in the first place? No one is demanding that Mass. Ave be adorned instead with a life-size rendition of the Adoration of the Magi, but is even St. Nicholas too sectarian for Harvard   Square?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HEI Hotels and Resorts, owner and operator of dozens of hotels across the country, has faced several protracted labor disputes over the last few years—some are settled, many others remain ongoing. Due to concerns about labor rights, Brown University’s Advisory Committee on Corporate Responsibility in Investment Policies prominently announced its decision to halt investment in HEI last year. University of Pennsylvania later followed suit, claiming that it had “no plans to make future investments in HEI-sponsored funds.” Earlier this week, Yale opted against reinvestment as well, albeit for “purely portfolio reasons.” To many, especially those in the labor movement, these declarations represent the long-overdue public condemnation of a company that engages in anti-union practices and creates sweatshop-like workplaces.
In light of the controversy surrounding HEI’s treatment of its workers, Harvard’s administration should consider halting further investment in HEI. This is especially true if current allegations of labor rights abuses are substantiated. On a broader level, the Harvard Management Company must address the glaring lack of transparency regarding its investment portfolio.
To this end, the administration should publicly disclose the contents of its endowment. Current state laws exempt Harvard by name from disclosure; this unacceptable technicality undermines any sense of corporate social responsibility. A non-transparent endowment denies access to information related to Harvard’s portfolio to not only the public, but also the Harvard community. This almost offensive level of opacity, coupled with Harvard Corporation Chair Robert D. Reischauer’s ’63 admission that students would likely take issue with many of HMC’s portfolio items were they disclosed, runs contrary to Harvard’s values.
Presently, the HMC has not disclosed any mechanism to review the ethics of the companies that comprise its portfolio. Despite the presence of an Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility  and a Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility, we still do not know of any internal committee that exists to review the social impact of investing in the undisclosed assets in Harvard’s portfolio. The administration should establish a body with this purpose if it does not exist already.
Harvard has a rare opportunity to affirm its commitment to social responsibility. It goes without saying that an institution like Harvard leads by example. University officials that speak of public service and social good are remiss if they openly refuse to practice what they preach. Therefore, Harvard should show that its regard for social responsibility goes beyond adding courses or hiring administrators by voting with its wallet, and at least pledging to review the ethical practices of firms in which it invests.
On a final note, insofar that Harvard does reevaluate its relationship with HEI, any investment decision should not be made because of the visibility of Occupy Harvard. A decision or declination to reinvest should instead be the product of a review process that fairly and empirically evaluates the facts surrounding a case, not a desire to relieve public tension; to do otherwise undercuts institutional legitimacy and makes public sentiment the only litmus test for administrative action. Ultimately, HMC should have the capability and conviction to find HEI responsible for unethical practices whether there are ten tents in the Yard or ten thousand.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The nominees for Literary Review’s annual Bad Sex in Fiction Award have been announced. The Bad Sex in Fiction award was established in 1993 by the magazine’s then editor, Auberon A. Waugh, in order to "draw attention to the crude, tasteless, often perfunctory use of redundant passages of sexual description in the modern novel, and to discourage it.”
The 2011 shortlist includes some big names: Haruki Murakami, nominated for “1Q84,” Stephen King for “11.22.63,” James Frey for “The Final Testament of the Holy Bible,” and Chris Adrian for “The Great Night,” among others. Previous nominees include Jonathan Franzen, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Tom Wolfe, Joyce Carol Oates, and Philip Roth, who—surprisingly—has only been nominated once. John Updike holds the distinction of possessing the sole Lifetime Achievement award.
Literary Review has begun posting excerpts from the nominated works on Twitter. Recent posts include “Now he realised that he was inside her, ejaculating toward her uterus” (from Haruki Murakami’s “1Q84”) and "at the end she began to gasp 'oh dear, oh my dear, oh my dear dear god, oh sugar!'" (from Stephen King’s “11.22.63”).
The award is about bad prose, not bad sex (although the two are certainly not mutually exclusive). In a recent article for the Financial Times, Jonathan Beckman, senior editor of Literary Review, explains, “ ‘[B]ad refers to the quality of the writing rather than the nature of intercourse. Unsuccessful, unpleasurable or abortive sex does not qualify per se; nor does kinky, brutal or unwanted sex, however unpalatable that may be.”
An incredible number of literary heavyweights have been insulted with spots on the Bad Sex shortlist over the course of the past 19 years. Which begs the question: Has sufficient attention been paid to the art of writing sex scenes? Are authors unaware of the wealth of writing tips to be gleaned from Cosmopolitan magazine’s monthly Red Hot Reads?
I suspect not. With this in mind, I would like to offer the following advice to writers who want to craft good sex scenes:
“Penis” is not a sexy word. Use “member” instead. Or “package.” Or, better yet, use both. Said members should be described in terms of length and rigidity. You should take care to include the word “throbbing” at least once. The appropriate female euphemism is “mound.”
All participants must orgasm. Preferably simultaneously. And preferably multiple times. You are encouraged to use words typically associated with liquids when describing orgasms. A few strong examples from stories published in Cosmopolitan: “When he thrust, an unexpected pleasure rippled through her” (Karen Rose, “Scream For Me”); “Tiny waves of pleasure were still undulating through her body” (Eden Bradley, “Forbidden Fruit”); “She cried out his name as tremors rippled throughout her body. It was like an explosion of pleasure inside her, and she gasped at the sensation” (Christie Ridgway, “Must Love Mistletoe”). Other good words include “tsunami,” “flood,” “hail,” and “waterfall.”
The more metaphors, the better. If you use enough metaphors, your prose can become as powerful as an earthquake that registers an eight on the Richter scale. Similarly, I recommend using as many adjectives as possible. You would be well served to keep a thesaurus nearby when writing and consult it regularly.
With the help of these tips, you, too, can write a sex scene that’s worthy of distinction.
Jonathan Beckman acknowledges, “It is easy to dismiss the Literary Review Bad Sex Award as manifesting a peculiarly English attitude to sex that is both prurient and prudish.”
Indeed, in a recent article for The Guardian, Honour Bayes described the award in precisely these terms: “The Literary Review looks down from its lofty position and gets ready to name and shame the author responsible for the worst sex scene of the year. But who are we [the British] really to judge?” Hayes proceeds to transition into a criticism of the dearth of sexiness in British theater, contending that “sexiness is most real on stage when it is unaffected.”
The same is true of fiction. Bayes misses the point of the Bad Sex Award, and, further, her criticism of British theater in fact parallels the ideology behind the award. Good sex writing, Beckman explains, is “clear, precise and…generally unobtrusive and undemonstrative.” This is the kind of writing that Literary Review hopes to encourage.
Submissions for additional nominees for this year’s award are still being accepted, but my bet’s on Chris Adrian’s “The Great Night,” which includes “he rolled himself on her and off her and poked her now from the front and now from the back and now from the side” and  “not actually knowing if it would be triumph or defeat until he came, standing, with both hands thrown high up over his head and his lady lifted to the stars on his impossibly stiff, impossibly eloquent cock. He came and came and came and fell backward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s officially holiday season at Eliot House. And if anyone has any doubts about that, all he needs to do is take a peek at the 14-foot Christmas tree that towers over House residents in the dining hall.
Two dozen Eliot residents spruced up the fir on Thursday night with sparkling streamers and a wide variety of ornaments.
Many more students joined in the merriment, celebrating the opening of the holiday season with food and song, if not with tree-trimming.
Everyone who took time off from studying to enjoy the festivities was treated to a spread of gingerbread men with sprinkles and frosting as well as eggnog, wine, and hot apple cider.
“What’s not to like here? We have music and food,” House Master Gail A. O’Keefe said. “It’s a wonderful event. The spirit makes it special.”
The obvious star of the night was the radiant evergreen. In addition to the store-bought ornaments hanging from every limb, students made handmade decorations during the evening to hang on the tree. In a craft project that perhaps summoned memories of kindergarten Christmastimes, students created diamond-shaped ornaments with two popsicle sticks and an array of yarns.
A student took to the piano to pound out classic Christmas tunes to underscore the festive activities.
Jayshlyn D. Acevedo ’14 was one of several House residents who seized the merry occasion as an opportunity to break out their favorite Christmas sweaters. She sported a blue jacket with a large reindeer stitched on in addition to a set of jingle bells.
Daniel C. Norris ’12 said the residents’ efforts demonstrated their House pride.
“We’ve got obviously the best community on campus,” Norris said. “It’s Thursday night. There are a lot of things people could be doing, but they’re down here because their friends are here—just having a good time making the House look pretty and enjoying cookies and stuff.”
House Master Douglas A. Melton said the Christmas tree would lighten the mood in Eliot during reading and finals period, those trying weeks that students must pass through before the holidays really arrive.
“We are lucky to have a big tree, because students use this dining hall during reading period for studying and it gives the dining hall a softer atmosphere rather than an intense studying spirit,” Melton said. “It smells good too.”

Despite weeks of speculation that Harvard football coach Tim Murphy is a target for the vacancy left by Joe Paterno’s departure as head coach at Pennsylvania State University, Murphy denied that Penn State officials have contacted him. However, he said that he has already received and turned down two offers from other programs since the end of the season.
Murphy would not reveal which schools or conferences had offered him head coaching positions but said that both were in the Football Bowl Subdivision, the largest and most lucrative division in college football.
“Both schools that I was contacted by, I told them that I was very happy here and very politely told them that I was not interested,” Murphy said from Charlotte, N.C., as he returned from a trip geared toward recruiting athletes for Harvard’s team.
Paterno, until a few weeks ago one of the most respected coaches in football, was fired last month for failing to adequately handle alleged child molestation by one of his assistant coaches, Jerry Sandusky. Paterno had been a coach for the Nittany Lions since 1950 and the team’s head coach since 1966.
Though there are a number of likely candidates already for Paterno’s post—in addition to Murphy, Mississippi State head coach Dan Mullen and University of Houston head coach Kevin Sumlin have been rumored as possible replacements—the search committee has not officially revealed its list of candidates.
Jeff Nelson, an assistant athletic director at Penn State, declined to comment on possible early targets in the search but said that acting Athletic Director Dave Joyner hopes to announce a new head coach in the next few weeks.
On Nov. 15, Dennis Dodd of CBSSports.com first reported that Murphy was interested in the coaching vacancy. But Murphy told The Crimson the next day that no one had ever contacted him about the position.
Nevertheless, speculation that Murphy is a potential candidate has grown in the past two weeks. Various Pennsylvania papers and Matt Hayes of Sporting News have all reported that he is a target for the job despite Murphy’s continued claims that he has not spoken to anyone from Penn State.
Murphy said that he declined his two other offers only minutes after the end of each conversation. He received both within a week of the end of Harvard’s season.
Murphy led Harvard to a historic season in 2011. The Crimson finished with a 9-1 record, including an undefeated 7-0 mark in Ivy League play. The team won its 14th league title and set Harvard’s modern-era record for points scored in a season.
He also passed Joe Restic, his predecessor, on the all-time wins list in Harvard coaching history and now sits at 120. This year marked Murphy’s sixth Ivy League Championship.
Since taking over as Harvard’s head coach in 1994, Murphy has turned down a number of high-profile coaching positions, especially after some of his most successful seasons.
After a 9-0 season in 2001, Murphy was reportedly on the short list for the job at Navy. In 2004, the team finished 10-0, and Murphy was offered the top position for the Indiana Hoosiers.
But neither of those jobs would have been nearly as prestigious—or, given the circumstances of his would-be predecessor’s departure, as difficult—as the position at Penn State.
Murphy does have prior experience coaching in the FBS, having served as the head coach at Cincinnati between 1989 and 1993. During his tenure, the team went 17-37-1. But in his last season at the helm, he led the Bearcats to an 8-3 record, their best since 1976.
After that season, citing personal reasons, Murphy took a pay cut and came to coach at Harvard.
Former Harvard quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05—now the starter for the Buffalo Bills—told CBSSports.com that he thought his former coach would be up to the challenge of the Penn State job.
“He’d be a perfect fit. He’s been so successful [at Harvard] not only on the field but with guys graduating, guys behaving off the field,” said Fitzpatrick, who was the captain of the perfect 2004 team. “He possesses all the qualities that I think they would look for.”
Harvard’s head coach has said that he has stayed with the Crimson despite other offers over the years because of his family and other personal reasons. But he does not deny that he would consider a Penn State offer if it came his way.
“You never say never in this business,” Murphy said in an interview two weeks ago. “But to put it simply, we’re very happy here.”

Over 30 students, workers, and union members marched in front of the Holyoke Center Thursday to protest hour cuts for disabled 61-year-old Harvard Yard Mail Center worker Marvin D. Byrd, who wears a brace on his left foot.
Marchers spent over an hour speaking and chanting in support of Byrd, yelling such cheers as “Justice for Marvin,” and “They say cutback, we say fight back.”
Byrd, who has worked in the mail center in the basement of the Science Center since 1995, had his hours decreased from 29 to 25 per week and was switched from a five- to six-day per-week schedule.
William P. Whitham ’14, a member of the Student Labor Action Movement who spoke at Thursday’s rally, said that the cut-backs in Byrd’s hours are part of a “disturbing” trend in the University’s attempts to economize.
“When the University wants to save money, they often take it out of workers’ wallets,” Whitham said. “It’s always older people, women, disabled people, and minorities that get the short end of the stick. [SLAM] is not saying Harvard is full of racists or sexists, but it’s upsetting when these things happen.”
Geoffrey “Geoff” Carens, a representative for the Harvard Union of Technical and Clerical Workers, the union which represents Byrd, said that he believes that Byrd’s disability is the reason he was targeted for a reduced schedule.
“Why Marvin? Why no one else in the unit?” Carens said. “It doesn’t make sense that they’re singling him out unless it’s for a specific reason.”
The University declined to comment.
Byrd filed a suit against the University through the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, but the suit was dismissed by the commission on October 31.
Byrd said the toughest part of his schedule shift is his commute. With his new schedule, he said he drives two and a half hours from his home in Lynn for only four or five hours of work.
“I don’t know why,” Byrd said. “I have a small disability, but I can do all of my work.”
But the decision to take the reduced schedule was the least of three evils, according to Byrd.
“They gave me three choices,” he said. “Either work 25 hours six days a week, 20 hours five days a week, or they were going to lay me off.”
Whitham emphasized the importance of student support in achieving justice for Byrd.
“The University often targets the most vulnerable workers,” he said. “But the workers are much stronger with the students behind them.”
According to Carens, supporters of Byrd will refuse to back down on the issue until Byrd is returned to his previous schedule.
“Byrd’s quality of life has diminished, and what economic security he has is in jeopardy,” Carens said. “We are going to hold the University’s feet to the fire on this issue.”

Esteemed author Jodi L. Picoult advocated greater reproductive rights for gay couples, a theme explored in her latest novel, in an appearance Thursday at Memorial Church.
“To me, it’s one of the last civil rights that we haven’t granted in this country,” Picoult said of gay rights.
She said she has long been interested in writing a novel about homosexuality and religion.
Her 18 novels, including bestsellers like “My Sister’s Keeper” and “Nineteen Minutes,” frequently probe ethical issues through tear-jerking or thrilling narratives.
Her latest book, “Sing You Home,” depicts a lesbian woman who wishes to conceive a child using frozen embryos from her earlier attempts to have a child with her ex-husband.
Gay rights hit close to home for Picoult. Her son came out to her and her husband in his college application essay.
The program on Thursday night, which was organized by the Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard, began with a performance by singer-songwriter John Grant. Grant performed several songs from his album, “Queen of Denmark,” which is about his experience growing up gay in the Midwest and moving to Colorado.
“It had already been imparted to me that [being gay] wasn’t okay,” Grant said of his childhood. “I hoped that it wouldn’t follow me to Colorado. But I’m glad that it did.”
Beyond the discussion of gay rights, Picoult shared aspects of her creative process in a question and answer session. The complex moral themes about which she writes, Picoult said, come from questions which she feels she cannot answer when she starts writing.
By the time she finishes a book, she feels she has made better sense of the topic, she said.
Picoult said that in preparation for “Sing You Home” she interviewed a woman who strongly opposes homosexual relationships. Picoult used portions of the interview verbatim as dialogue in the novel.
The hardest moment of the six-hour conversation, Picoult said, was when she asked the woman about the bullying of gay and lesbian children. Her interviewee responded, “Thank goodness that’s never happened.”
She said that she hopes her novels spur similar tough conversations among her readers.
“I don’t want to be the kind of writer who says, ‘You should believe this.’ I want to be the kind of writer who says, ‘How come you believe that, and have you thought about what the other side has to say?’” Picoult said. “You may never agree, but that’s the beginning of the conversation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A packed auditorium erupted in applause on Thursday evening as the Wu-Tang Clan’s GZA delivered some original rhymes and reflected on his life and career in an event hosted by the Harvard Black Men’s Forum in the Science Center.
Although GZA, born Gary Grice, has spent much of his adult life in front of sold-out venues, the rapper expressed nervousness as he began his monologue.
“This is the first time for me. I should be learning from you all,” GZA said. “I’m actually shaking right now, crazy,” he added with a laugh.
As he took the stage, a lecture hall full of fans greeted him with shouts of the trademark Wu-Tang phrase, “Peace.”
The artist, also known as The Genius, began by taking the audience through his childhood in “Shaolin”—Wu-Tang lingo for Staten Island—where his first encounters with wordplay came from a book of nursery rhymes. By his teenage years, GZA and future group-mates RZA and Ol’ Dirty Bastard were trekking across the boroughs of New York City in search of the best rap battles they could find.
“Everything we did revolved around hip hop,” he said. “I would ask around, ‘Who’s the best?’ and I would go look for them.”
“[It was] just like the flicks,” he added. “One dude would roll up, another dude rolls up, and there’s 40 people waiting outside the building.”
GZA went on to recount the humbling experience of going back to work after his first record deal in the late 1980s didn’t pan out. He had a job as a bicycle messenger just six months before his career took off with the release of Wu-Tang’s first single, “Protect Ya Neck,” in 1992.
He interspersed his discussion of his musical influences and creative process with a cappella verses and witty rhymes.
“To write a story is to create a world of your own,” he said. “I think every being in the universe is connected somehow ... and when I write a song, it’s a lot like building a puzzle.”
During the event, GZA responded to an audience question about his opinion on mainstream hip-hop today.
“I hear songs like [50 Cent’s] ‘Window Shopper,’” he said, quoting lyrics from the 2005 song and suggesting that the lyrics did not meet his own standards.
“Do you think that equates with some of the lyrics that I was kicking?’” he said.
The event attracted fans from beyond the Harvard community.
“I definitely expected him to talk more about music and the group,” said Andrew Lacombe, a sophomore at Dean College who made the trip from Franklin, Mass. “But him talking about life was a lot better.”
GZA closed his lecture with some advice for those that had turned out.
“Live a life full of humility, gratitude, intellectual curiosity, and never stop learning.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This coming January, lively philosophical debates—the hallmark of Professor Michael J. Sandel’s perennially popular class “Ethical Reasoning 22: Justice”—will be uprooted from their usual Sanders Theater setting to reach students on the other side of world. About thirty students who took the class last fall—its most recent offering—will participate in a video chat with students who are taking a Sandel-inspired course at the University of Tokyo.
Harvard students will join their Japanese counterparts in a discussion of equality, citizenship, and democracy led by Sandel and University of Tokyo Philosophy of Law Professor Tatsuo Inoue. In an email Wednesday night, Sandel invited former students to participate in what he called an “exciting experiment in global education.”
“Justice,” which enrolled 805 students last fall, is one of the best-known and most popular courses offered at Harvard. In 2009, Boston public television station WGBH released a series of “Justice” lectures, now available online.
The show was then translated and retitled “Harvard Hakunetsu Kyoshitu,” which means “Harvard’s Heated Discussion Classroom,” and broadcast for audiences in Japan. It immediately attracted millions of viewers and inspired the University of Tokyo to develop its own version of the class.
“The show and the publishing of Sandel’s book was the start of a boom of philosophy in Japan,” said Ryosuke Kobayashi ’13, who took Justice last year and also has friends in the class at the University of Tokyo.
The University of Tokyo’s “Justice” course consists of thirteen sessions and is team-taught.
“I want to have the University of Tokyo students exposed to international dialogue,” said Masako Egawa, executive vice president of the University of Tokyo.
Egawa said she hopes the video conference will add to the initial success of the program in Tokyo.
Typically, universities in Asia place more emphasis on lectures and memorization, while Sandel uses the Socratic method in his participation-based lectures.
“I went to Japan this summer to teach a class and I didn’t get the feeling that any of them were used to having a discussion,” said former “Justice” student Jimmy P. Bohnslav ’13. “Professor Sandel is unique in that he tries to keep this lecture really interactive—he will have to work hard to overcome that kind of culture.”
Former Sandel students expressed their excitement for the opportunity and said they were curious about what the dynamic of the combined group will be.
“Justice is restricted to a bunch of privileged American college students,” says Daniel M. Claridge ’13, who is also a Crimson sports writer. “It’d be interesting to see what people on the other side of the world think of it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Asa Gray and Louis Agassiz started out as friends.
The two frequented the same natural history societies, spoke at the same popular Boston lecture series, and dined together at the Faculty Club in their early days as Harvard professors in the 1840s.
They worked just blocks from each other on campus, pioneering separate institutions that would shape Harvard for generations to come. But in 1859, a revolutionary idea sprouted across the pond—and irrevocably drove them apart.
When Charles Darwin published “On the Origin of Species,” Agassiz staunchly resisted the British scientist’s controversial theory—Gray, however, became one of Darwin’s most ardent proponents in America.
Their diverging opinions influenced the trajectories of each naturalist’s burgeoning project: Gray’s botanical haven on Garden Street sowed the seeds of Harvard’s evolution-oriented herbaria, while Agassiz designed the Museum of Comparative Zoology on Oxford Street with a non-evolutionary viewpoint in mind.
Both institutions have survived and thrived. But while the MCZ is a popular afternoon destination for families toting small children, the herbaria are frequented mainly by researchers. Gray’s role in enduring Harvard traditions—including the Harvard Summer School, which he founded 140 years ago—has faded from popular memory.
But a project digitizing Darwin’s letters has helped draw Gray and the herbaria back into the limelight.
“We think of [Gray] as being a quiet old botanist,” says history of science professor Janet Browne, the general editor of the U.S. branch of the Darwin Correspondence Project. “But actually, he was a tremendous intellectual and activist in getting these ideas out and about.”
Those ideas he espoused bear fruit to this day in the Harvard University Herbaria, where scientists glean new knowledge from centuries-old specimens.
NATURAL RESOURCES
Gray’s herbarium, which relocated from Garden Street to Divinity Avenue in 1954, is today joined by four more Harvard herbaria that together house more than five million specimens—as well as state-of-the-art labs for analyzing them.
In addition, the copious historical documents stored in the herbaria’s libraries are pored over by botanists from institutions all over the world, as well as many historians of science.
Donald H. Pfister, the interim director of the Harvard University Herbaria, oversees the preservation and distribution of all these specimens. His office is a testament to the riches quietly accumulated over the years at the herbaria. A hat made of mushrooms, an enormous framed stamp featuring Gray’s visage (created for the bicentennial anniversary of his birth last year), and field guides with ornate covers all adorn his shelves. Pfister says that not only plants, but also personalities live on in the herbaria.
“We’ve all left little pieces of ourselves in the collections,” he says. “We’ve annotated, made notes, written labels. The ghosts are there, in a way.”
To this day, artist-scientists spend their days drying, mounting, and labeling new additions. In the mounting room, soothing music fills the air, and the tables are strewn with historic newspapers in which specimens were once wrapped. The team has been busy salvaging about 13,000 specimens that were damaged in a flood two years ago, a task which is now nearly complete.
Beyond the mounting rooms are cases upon cases of plant specimens—including an “economic botany” collection cataloging how plants have been used by mankind throughout history.
One of the herbaria’s foremost archival treasures is a first edition copy of “On the Origin of Species,” presented to Gray by Darwin himself and annotated by both of the legendary scientists.
Personal touches like those margin notes make the archives valuable to historians of science, says Rebecca J. H. Woods, an MIT graduate student who recently transcribed a lengthy letter by Jane L. Gray, Asa’s wife.
“When it comes to people’s letters, you get a sense of who they are based on how they write,” says Woods.
In the case of Jane Gray’s letters, they paint a portrait of Gray as a sensitive man with a wonderful sense of humor, says Lisa A. DeCesare, the herbaria’s head of public services and archives.
“He had a talent for picking any flowers by the side of the road, and before you knew it, it would be a lovely bouquet,” DeCesare says, sharing details she gleaned from hours perusing Jane Gray’s correspondence. “You can know the dates and what people studied, but when you read the letters, you really get to know things they didn’t even know they were sharing.”
INCH BY INCH, ROW BY ROW
Long before the herbaria became home to millions of specimens and started loaning items to institutions worldwide, it was a simple garden in Gray’s backyard.
When Gray, originally a medical doctor, became professor of natural history at Harvard in 1842, he set to work soliciting plant specimens from all corners of the globe.
“He saw that the way to start a collection was to get other people to send you things,” Browne says. “He was very skilled at that—very charming. He saw himself as a centerpiece of a wide web.”
After making a few expeditions himself, Gray sent letters to reel in exotic specimens from regions like the South Pacific, Europe, and East Asia. These letters are stored in the Gray Archive at the herbaria—a collection of great interest to the Harvard branch of the Darwin Correspondence Project because it contains Gray’s myriad exchanges with Darwin.
Of particular import to Gray was a series of specimens sent from Asia: when he compared Japanese flora to seemingly unrelated species in North America, he recorded his astonishment at the plants’ striking similarities.
That discovery, Pfister says, “fits into the Darwin story because it makes it easier to argue that life is connected.”
Despite starting his collection nearly from scratch, Gray created a store of botanical knowledge that was one-of-a-kind in North America, according to Pfister.
“He made it terrific,” Browne says of Gray’s garden. “It was an experimental garden, a pleasure garden, a teaching garden, just on the other side of the Quad.”
In the 1940s, the property on which the garden rested was sold. A housing complex, named Botanic Apartments in homage to what once stood there, was built on top of the garden’s remnants.
History of science lecturer Alistair W. Sponsel says he sometimes questions whether Gray’s legacy has been obscured like his once-flourishing garden—especially when compared to Agassiz, whose name is stamped on a theater in Radcliffe Yard.
Pfister partly attributes this disparity to the fact that, “Gray never fit into the Boston social scene quite as easily as Agassiz.” Sponsel wonders instead if the “controversial figures” like biologists E.O. Wilson and Ernst Mayr who have been associated with the MCZ since Agassiz’s time have thrust the museum more prominently into the public eye.
“A lot of exemplary work in natural history—like Linnaeus coming up with his binomial system of classification—was most famously done on plants using herbarium specimens,” Woods reflects. “Plants are still important for a lot of the same reasons, but I’ve wondered whether the public recognizes that as much as they recognize big displays in a museum.”
A BLOSSOMING LEGACY
Competition with Agassiz aside, Gray’s impact lives on in the Harvard Summer School and in one of Harvard’s longest-running courses: the more-than-150-year-old “Plants and Human Affairs,” which is today known as Organismic and Evolutionary Biology 59 and is co-taught by Pfister and professor Charles C. Davis.
The course utilizes the herbaria’s resources to bring to life the relationships humans have had with plants for millennia.
Another of Gray’s classes was significant not so much for its content but for the season in which it was taught: Gray taught the first ever Harvard Summer School course in 1871.
Two years earlier, Charles Eliot had become president of Harvard and inaugurated a wave of curricular reforms, from the introduction of electives to the adoption of a departmental system. Under this more flexible framework, summer courses became a possibility, Pfister says.
While the desirability of studying plants in the summer as opposed to frigid Cambridge winters was likely Gray’s impetus, the Summer School marked an important step for female scholars.
“Summer school from the beginning had women,” Pfister notes. “It was really the first big chance for women to use Harvard facilities.”
‘BREATHING LIFE’ INTO OLD SPECIMENS
All of Gray’s collections, and millions of other herbaria specimens, are accessible to botanists today—but the herbaria staff must work constantly to revise and update plant databases, as names and classification systems shift dramatically over time.
“That’s one real way in which our field is distinguished from most of biology,” says Davis, who in addition to his teaching uses the herbaria collections to study plant phylogenies and trace the effect of climate change on various species. “If you go next door and ask what’s valid, five or ten years out ... it’s obsolete.”
But one researcher’s burden is another’s historical treasure trove: from a history of science perspective, old plant labels are ripe for study.
“It’s the most wonderful sequence of working your way through how scientific knowledge really emerges,” Browne says of studying the layers of annotations on various specimens at the herbaria. “You can re-live the process of science.”
Sometimes current research can even be applied to answer the questions asked by scientists of the past, Davis says. For example, his own research has explored questions about plant diversity initially addressed by Henry David Thoreau, Class of 1837, and scientists have used plant DNA analysis to illuminate the Japan-America plant connections that so intrigued Gray.
“We’ve started to integrate more cutting-edge molecular approaches, but our field of plant diversity and evolution builds much more so on old literature and old research than a lot of the other hard-core molecular disciplines,” Davis explains. “We’re breathing life into these old collections.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tomi J. Adeyemi ’15 was at Eleganza’s date auction at Cambridge Queen’s Head at 8:40 p.m. on Tuesday night when her eyes started to turn red.
“I thought, ‘Okay, this will fade,’” she recalls.
At the time, she figured she was just tired, or at worst, that she had pink eye. She decided that if she woke up the next morning with “crusty” eyes, she would go to CVS to buy some eye drops.
But at 1 a.m., after she had returned to her suite in Grays Hall to go to sleep, her eyes started hurting.
“I thought, ‘Pink eye doesn’t hurt like this. Something’s wrong.’”
By 4 a.m., experiencing “unbearable” pain and “blurry” vision, Adeyemi and her roommate rushed to Harvard University Health Services urgent care.
Adeyemi and her roommate, Laura J. Cheng ’15, went outside into the windy night, and Adeyemi immediately had to close her eyes because the gusts “felt kind of like sharp glass in my eye.”
When Adeyemi and Cheng walked into Urgent Care at 4:15 a.m., the nurses at the front desk appeared to know why Adeyemi had come and asked if she had been in Life and Physical Sciences A: “Foundational Chemistry and Biology” lab that afternoon. She told them yes. The nurses told her that “this had happened to a lot of kids” and that “it had been happening all night.”
Adeyemi was one of about five students who were exposed to ultraviolet light in LPSA lab on Tuesday while not using the proper eye protection. As a result, they suffered from what Adeyemi was told may have been “thermal retinal burn from UV radiation,” a condition that includes symptoms of eye redness, pain, and blurry vision.
On Tuesday afternoon, Adeyemi, whose eyesight has now recovered fully, had walked into Science Center 117 for her last three-hour LPSA lab of the semester.
The roughly 60 students in the lab would be completing the second half of a two-week lab that used polymerase chain reaction analysis to identify genetically modified foods.
Among their tasks for the day would be an electrophoresis procedure in which they would inject a sample of DNA into gel and then run an electric current across the gel. That process would separate DNA strands of different length. And when viewed under a blue light transilluminator, the strands’ differing lengths would become apparent.
The transilluminator emits UV light, but the printed instructions for the lab made no mention of the need to use safety goggles or to view the gel through a clear protective screen. It is unclear whether verbal instructions regarding safety procedures were issued to the students.
Six LPSA professors, preceptors, and teaching fellows, as well as University spokesperson Nanci Martin, did not respond to repeated requests for comment Thursday night. Head teaching fellow Joshua I. Rosenbloom was reached by phone but declined to comment.
On Wednesday, co-course head Gregory Tucci sent an email to the class saying that anyone who experienced “eye discomfort (irritation, redness, tearing, pain)” should contact UHS, adding that “individuals who viewed their gels while using the plastic safety protective shield or while wearing safety glasses should not be experiencing eye problems.”
The course’s “LPSA Introduction and Lab Safety” handout, distributed to students at the start of the semester, declares that “Massachusetts state law requires that goggles, a face shield, or prescription safety glasses be worn by every student at all times while he or she is in the laboratory. No exceptions will be made.”
Although she says the class “never really learned about UV safety,” the lab teaching fellows had “reinforced” the need to always wear safety goggles in the lab throughout the semester, Adeyemi says.
“As soon as you walk in, it’s the rule that you have to put on goggles,” Julia B. Hyman ’15 says.
But that afternoon, three days before the end of fall semester classes, Adeyemi says that “everyone was in a lazy kind of mood.”
“It was last-lab fever,” Hyman adds.
“In my mind, I was like, ‘oh, we’re not working with fire or chemicals, so it should be okay.’” Adeyemi recalls.
But while Cheng and Hyman say that the transilluminator that they were working had the protective screen pressed down on the sample, Adeyemi says that in some stations in her section, the protective screen was not always pushed down.
As a result, she and several other students without goggles gazed at their samples with no barrier to block the ultraviolet light emanating from the transilluminator.
“Our TFs have been really great about lab safety. They’ve been really strict about it,” Adeyemi emphasizes. “It was like the one day they weren’t.”
When Adeyemi transferred to the Eye and Ear Infirmary at 5 a.m. on Wednesday morning she was met there by a man from the Freshman Dean’s Office, who told her that all her schoolwork would be excused. Later that day, she received “really sympathetic and apologetic” emails from her teaching fellow, her two LPSA professors, her proctor and her residential dean.
The Office of the Dean of the College also told Adeyemi that it would reimburse all medical costs accrued as a result of the accident.
While Adeyemi said that her father “was initially a little upset” when she told him about what had happened, she insists that she holds no lasting grudges.
“This is not a situation where blame needs to be assigned,” she says.

CORRECTIONS: December 4, 2011
An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified Harvard University Health Services. Additionally, due to an editing error, that same version featured a headline that reported that students experienced retinal burn after the lab. While one student was told that she may have suffered from a retinal burn, the extent of other students' eye injuries are unclear.

As part of their December Students with Drive contest, Zipcar and Ford are giving out $5,500 worth of Zipcar credits to five different student groups across five categories, and the Harvard Speech and Parliamentary Debate Society has reached the final round.
HSPDS President Coulter P. King '13 said that he fears having to limit the number of students who can attend the approximately 30 tournaments in which HSPDS participates due to limited funds and car space.
As HSPDS, unlike many student organizations, allows any undergraduate who wishes to participate to join their group, the group faces growing travel costs as more students become involved. HSPDS Vice President of Recruitment and Training Madeline R. Zhu '14 said that the prize would help alleviate these costs by providing for about a year and a half of the organization's Zipcar expenses.
"We train everybody, even people who have no experience, and we turn them into national champions," Zhu said.
HSPDS is one of three groups listed under the Academic category in the Students with Drive competition. The group has already won $1,000 as a finalist, but must receive the most votes in its category to win the big $5,500 prize.
Voting through Facebook will continue through Dec. 7.

On most afternoons, Theresa G. Feng ’13 can be found on the fourth floor of the Sherman Fairchild building, home to the Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology (SCRB).
Feng works in the laboratory of Harvard Stem Cell Institute Co-director and Natural Sciences Professor Douglas A. Melton, whose research focuses primarily on the role that stem cells play in the developmental biology of the pancreas.
The Melton Lab’s long-term goal is to find a cure for Type I diabetes.
Feng, a junior in Lowell House, has worked in the Melton Lab since spring of her sophomore year. Her interest in stem cell research grew after taking SCRB 10: "Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology," a course that is co-taught by Professors Kevin C. Eggan, Andrew P. McMahon, and Melton himself.
With aspirations to attend medical school, Feng dedicates roughly 15 to 20 hours per week of her time outside of the classroom to research.
"Theresa is extremely good at the bench," said Jose Rivera-Feliciano, a Post-Doctoral Fellow in Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology who supervises Feng in the lab.
"She has been able to quickly master very difficult techniques and use them to answer important questions in our field," he said.
Currently, Feng is helping to improve the protocol involved in making complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries from the RNA of adult beta cells—the cells in the pancreas that make and release insulin. These "libraries"—which are collections of cDNA fragments—can be used to express human pancreatic genes in the host cells of model organisms like mice or bacteria.
Feng said that the most exciting aspect of her research lies in the possibility of discovering mRNA that code for proteins that increase the production of insulin-producing beta cells for diabetic patients.
But more than the academic and intellectual rewards of research, Feng said that she enjoys the atmosphere of learning that she is exposed to at the Melton Lab.
"There’s a feeling of community in the lab because people are constantly collaborating and making small talk," she said.
This community, she continued, extends beyond the walls of the laboratory. This summer, Melton Lab members participated in the Rhino League volleyball tournament as a bonding experience, playing against teams of other Harvard scientists on campus.
These lab colleagues have also taken an interest in Feng’s life outside of the lab. Her fellow researchers were surprised to find out that ‘T’—as they fondly call her—breakdances and is a member of the Harvard-Radcliffe Christian Fellowship when she isn’t working on beta cells.
Though passionate about her work, Feng is still unsure as to whether she will continue research in the future.
"I think that being a scientist is fun, but I’m still not sure whether I want to dedicate my entire life to it," she said. "But for now, I definitely love it."

Last month, Physics Professor Lisa J. Randall ’84 experienced a thrill unusual for scientists: she saw her name in lights on the marquee of a 2000-person theater. Randall was speaking in Portland, Oregon while on tour for her new book, “Knocking on Heaven’s Door: How Physics and Scientific Thinking Illuminate the Universe and the Modern World.” The book, which was published on Sept. 20, was recently named one of the New York Times’s 100 Notable Books of 2011.
“Knocking on Heaven’s Door” is the second award-winning book that Randall has published in her eleven years of teaching at Harvard. The first, titled “Warped Passages: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe’s Hidden Dimensions,” was one of the Times’s 100 Notable Books of 2005.
“You work very hard on a book, so it’s really nice to know that people appreciate it,” she said of the success of her latest book. “I tried hard to write it well so people could read through it and enjoy the experience—not suffer through it.”
In “Knocking on Heaven’s Door,” Randall weaves together several main topics: the importance and nature of scientific thinking, the relationships between science and religion, the state of particle physics today, the implications and history of the Large Hadron Collider, and the state of cosmology and dark matter searches.
Randall, who was named one of Time Magazine’s 100 Most Influential People in 2007, said she focused on making these topics accessible to the general public.
“I think people who realize that they are allowed to read it as an individual, that they are allowed to skip parts that are too technical for them, really enjoy it,” Randall said.
The book’s accessibility to readers of all fields is exemplified by the diversity of reviewers on the book jacket, who range from former President Bill Clinton to Psychology Professors Daniel T. Gilbert and Steven Pinker to former Harvard President Lawrence H. Summers.
Physics Professor Arthur Jaffe, who taught Randall when she was an undergraduate, said he looks forward to reading her book.
“Randall is a great communicator, as well as a really outstanding physicist. I think that she will motivate many young people to pursue physics,” he said.
“Knocking on Heaven’s Door” has been translated into Spanish, and Randall’s book tour has taken her to cities across the United States as well as Barcelona, London, and “The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.”
Before she considers writing another book, Randall said she plans to focus on her work on dark matter as well as her research on the Large Hadron Collider and model building.
Professor Howard M. Georgi ’68, who taught Randall when she was an undergraduate and later served as her PhD adviser, said that he hopes Randall’s book will generate excitement among the general public for the importance of science. Reading her book, he added, is “a project for winter break.”

Harvard researchers have developed a swarm of inexpensive robots, called Kilobots, that can be used to test collective algorithms on a large scale. These robots, designed by members of the Self-Organizing Systems Research Group at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, can be programmed and controlled as a group rather than individually.
Researchers in a variety of fields may use Kilobots to test algorithms on a greater scale without relying on potentially inaccurate computer simulations.
Dr. Nicholas Hoff, who wrote his doctoral thesis on swarm algorithms and worked on the Kilobot Project, said that while the last 50 years has seen robots in monolithic industrial and commercial applications, multi-robot systems could be used in swarm transportation, collective construction, and to search for environmental contaminants.
“There’s a fairly large gap between what is currently possible and what is envisioned,” Hoff said. “The vision might be a million billion robots flying around, each of which has a little component of some building, and they just swarm around and pretty soon you’d have a building the way ants build an anthill. That’s pretty far away from what’s sitting in any research lab I know about. But the algorithm development is on the way.”
Researcher Michael Rubenstein, a postdoctoral fellow at SEAS, said that multi-robot systems could also be used in educational settings, and that biologists may use them to test theories about swarming behaviors of insects.
Each Kilobot has an infrared receiver and transmitter that allows it to communicate with other Kilobots and to be programmed by an overhead controller.
Rubenstein said the next project is to test algorithms that have only been simulated on the computer on a fleet of 1000 Kilobots. One such algorithm is scalable self-assembly, in which the robots coordinate to form a shape.
Individual Kilobots cost $14 to make. Kilobot researchers lowered costs by replacing a more expensive motor with vibration motors like those in cell phones.
“We tried to make them as simple as possible,” Rubenstein said.
The Kilobots have been licensed commercially to K-Team Corporation and the software and hardware details have been open-sourced. Building Kilobots, though, requires specific experience.
“You need a lot of electronics background to build them and understand what you’re doing,” Rubenstein said. “If you’re a computer scientist and don’t really have any experience in actual hardware, it may be easier to purchase them.”
Christian T. Ahler, a SEAS and Wyss Institute fellow, helped design and develop the Kilobots, the overhead controller, and the Graphical User Interface for the Kilobot system. Ahler said he hoped Kilobots would inspire other researchers to develop commercial products. Exact discoveries that may arise from using Kilobots, though, are undetermined.
“That’s exactly what we don’t know,” Ahler said.

Researchers at Harvard and the University of California, Santa Barbara have discovered the driving force behind the rapid radiation of columbine flowers—the explosive speciation from a single recent floral ancestor.
According to findings published in “Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,” cell elongation—rather than cell proliferation—is responsible for the varying lengths of floral spurs in these species. These nectar-containing spurs, which protrude from the bases of the flower petals, have evolved to attract and fit the tongue of specific pollinator insects.
“In the end, we found that the traditional ideas of how the spurs develop were wrong,” said co-principal investigator Elena M. Kramer.
Kramer, a professor of organismic and evolutionary biology, began studying the Aquilegia genus over 10 years ago.
The young genus has undergone rapid radiation into about 70 columbine flower species in the past 3 million years.
“The petal spurs play an important role in allowing proper evolution,” said Joshua R. Puzey, a graduate student in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology and co-lead author of the study.
For this work, Kramer partnered with co-principal investigator L. Mahadevan, a professor of applied mathematics, organismic and evolutionary biology, and physics at Harvard. While Kramer and Puzey analyzed the problem from an evolutionary standpoint, Mahadevan and co-lead author Sharon Gerbode, a postdoctoral fellow at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, approached the problem through quantitative morphology, the statistical analysis of organism shape.
“We just came at it from completely different angles,” said Puzey.
Until now, most biologists assumed that cells in the spurs divide and proliferate to produce spurs of different lengths. However, the investigators discovered that the spur cells stop dividing when the organ is only 2-20 percent of its final length. From there, the cells change shape and elongate, yielding the final size of the spur.
“You can explain 99 percent of the difference in spur length with difference in cell length,” Kramer said. “It made me appreciate that there were a lot of questions we could answer with simple experiments.”
The scientists plan to further explore the process of diversification in these flowers by examining cell division and expansion in older plant species.
“The best thing about the project was the really rewarding collaboration,” Kramer said. “I think it was a good combination of people willing to speak the same language.”

U.S. Secretary of Energy and Nobel laureate, Steven Chu, entered an auditorium at Northwest Labs to a flurry of applause yesterday afternoon. Chu spoke at this year’s Konrad Bloch Lecture, delivering a talk titled “The Role of Science, Technology and Innovation in Solving the Energy Challenge.”
Chu was introduced to the crowd by Harvard professor Howard C. Berg. Berg described Chu as having an energetic personality.
“It seems appropriate, then, that he is the twelfth U.S. Secretary of the Department of Energy,” said Berg, eliciting laughter from the audience.
The Bloch Lecture, which has been held annually by the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology since 1986, is sponsored by Pfizer and honors former Harvard professor and Nobel laureate Konrad Bloch.
Chu, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997 for his work in cooling and trapping atoms with laser light, began his lecture by highlighting the role that scientific advancements have played throughout history.
Projecting a photograph of an early basic integrated circuit onto the screen, Chu traced the origins of gadgets such as iPods and touchscreens to day-old inventions.
Chu emphasized the simple yet transformative power of science in technology and transportation, citing the creation of fertilizer and airplanes. He then turned his focus towards innovations in energy.
“America has the opportunity to lead the world in clean energy technologies,” said Chu.
Chu predicted that the price of solar energy will decrease in the coming years. More importantly, he mentioned that if the price of solar energy experiences a fourfold decrease, then it could compete with any form of energy, including natural gas. Most current models project a twofold decrease. Though hopeful of the development of green technologies, Chu stressed the importance of lowering energy expenditure.
According to Chu, government subsidies are more necessary when green technologies are just emerging.
“The closer you get to the foundation of research, the less companies are willing to invest because they’re not going to capture all of their investments,” said Chu.
“I was more encouraged [about U.S. energy policies] after hearing Secretary Chu speak,” said Melanie V. Sinche, Director at the FAS Office of Post-Doctoral Affairs. “He’s clearly in touch with key players in the economy for energy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Herman Cain thought he could win—and for a while, America did too. It seems now that this is not so. Scandals, both sexual and intellectual, have eaten away at his candidacy, and it seems clear that his star is sinking back into the depths of the Republican primary firmament. Yet there is an incident from Cain’s campaign, when it seemed he could win, that did not receive enough coverage, an incident that revealed a troubling tendency in contemporary American attitudes toward the unemployed.
I’m referring, of course, to Cain’s “if you don’t have a job, and you’re not rich, blame yourself” remark. Certainly the incident received some coverage. But it didn’t reach the heart of the matter.
With that statement, Cain was telling America’s unemployed that he was leaving them behind. With that single statement, Cain made it clear that finding jobs for those without them would not be a priority if he were elected. If, after all, unemployment is the fault of the unemployed, Cain is not there to help.
That’s nine percent of the workforce Cain gave up, right then and there—almost 14 million potential votes that Cain threw away, in a single sentence. Far more, in fact, if you count the chronically underemployed and those no longer looking for work.
Now, perhaps the unemployed are overwhelmingly Democrats; this is not utterly implausible (It would, however, thoroughly undermine any Republican claim to speak for the real troubles of real Americans). But it’s not just a question of those 14 million Americans. It’s a question of their friends and families; their dependents and those supporting them. The unemployed and their close relations are a tragically huge constituency in today’s America, and Cain gave them up. Yet he—and many others—still thought he could win. That means that Herman Cain believed that employed Americans, fortunate Americans, would vote overwhelmingly for someone who declared his intention to leave their unemployed fellows behind.
Herman Cain is very lucky to be seeking the presidency in this secular age. The fact that a candidate with the name of the first murderer could be facing off against a president whose name means “blessed” is unlikely to sway any notable segment of the electorate. But Cain’s name is surprisingly indicative. The Biblical Cain, shortly after his murder, is confronted by God about his missing brother. Cain replies sarcastically: “Am I my brother’s keeper?” The answer, of course, is yes. Doubly so, as Cain both has an existing obligation to care for his brother, and is responsible for his death.
The parallels here are a God-given gift to the lazy editorialist. Herman Cain is not innocent or uninvolved in the current economic crisis. Herman Cain rose to prominence in the business world through his tenure at Godfather’s Pizza, where he presided over thousands of layoffs. Thousands of layoffs, which he said were necessary for the business to survive—and yet today he has the gall to speak to the nation’s unemployed and laid off and tell them that it’s their own fault. Herman Cain entered the political world by lobbying for a business association. He is intimately familiar with the ugly alliance between business and government; he knows exactly how taxpayer dollars end up, for example, being spent propping up flagging pizza companies—and yet today he declares that if you’re not rich, you should blame yourself.
Herman Cain doesn’t care. He made his fortune and gained his fame through the same system that has increased income inequality for the past three decades, and he doesn’t care about the poor. He rose to power on a wave of layoffs, and he doesn’t care about the unemployed.
Yet Herman Cain still thought he could win. He believes that a marked majority of those Americans who are employed will turn their backs on their unemployed compatriots. Herman Cain believes he can win entirely on the votes of those who refuse to be their brothers’ keepers. I think that a win for Herman Cain would be a bad thing for the U.S. But I think that even more, it would reveal something embarrassing about who we are, and what we stand for as a nation. And, sadly, I see no reason to believe that any of his fellow party members are even better. They may not have spoken so bluntly, but the ideology of the Republican Party speaks clearly enough. “If you don’t have a job, blame yourself—even if we fired you.”
Times are tough. If, instead of pulling together as a nation, we vote for the “tough luck” party, we should be ashamed of ourselves.
