After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Let’s be honest: The University’s opposition to fossil fuels divestment isn’t about money, it’s about politics.
Much to the chagrin of student activists who hoped to see Massachusetts Hall engage in day-to-day issues at the College, from divestment to sexual harassment to ethnic studies, University President Lawrence S. Bacow has had a singular focus since he assumed Harvard’s presidency: defending higher education from the onslaught of the culture wars. Whether through visible commitments to public service, high-profile appearances in the Midwest, or advocacy for clearer immigration policies and the repeal of the endowment tax, President Bacow has expressed consistent fear that Harvard’s ability to fulfill its mission will suffer if it can’t shake the perception that it is an elitist liberal bubble.
All of this is appropriate and even laudable, but it means that divestment is surely a nonstarter. In a 2018 interview with The Crimson, Bacow argued that Harvard’s endowment should not be used “as an instrument of social policy.” Mass. Hall clearly feels that fossil fuels divestment has the potential to be a public relations nightmare — as would any other policy that conspicuously promotes progressive social change — and is too risky a move at a time when the president has studiously avoided issues that would land Harvard on the front page of conservative opinion papers.
In light of this, the push to divest Harvard’s endowment from the fossil fuels industry seems hopelessly stalled, notwithstanding recent major gains in support among both students and faculty. (And it is the support of Bacow and the Harvard Corporation that matters: Though activists had a major victory last month as three pro-divestment candidates won seats on the Board of Overseers, they will be dismayed to learn just how little power their new representatives will have to change investment strategy.)
But divestment is only one of many options on the table. Where should student organizers turn their attention next?
The real prize is a University-wide initiative on climate change research.
From an administrator’s perspective, a new initiative doesn’t risk the culture wars conflagration that divestment would be — while it’s easy to imagine a radio screed arguing that divestment tells middle-class secretaries at ExxonMobil that Harvard hates them and wants to eliminate their jobs, it’s hard to intentionally misconstrue coordinated research investment as being dismissive of people who work in the fossil fuel industry.
Activists should see major, sustained investment in climate change research as a win, too. It pushes Mass. Hall to make concrete its abstract and platitudinous calls for “academic and institutional efforts” on climate change by supercharging the work undertaken by leaders at places like the Center for the Environment. And even the most ardent divestment supporters have to acknowledge the merit of making progress on the underlying environmental issues at a time when national politics makes divestment impossible.
Meanwhile, Harvard should seize the opportunity to cement its position as the American center for climate change scholarship. One of the central arguments for divesting the University endowment from fossil fuels is that Harvard would be setting an example for future schools. While I worry the window has passed for Harvard’s proposed divestment to move the needle on other campuses (not to mention that the current economic crisis in higher education has left few schools with an appetite for non-essential financial tinkering), I am optimistic that a University initiative on climate change would spur other research institutions to step up to the plate on climate research, magnifying the impact of Harvard’s efforts.
Where the initiative would live is an open question. Perhaps it should find a home at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, an institution uniquely positioned to lead interdisciplinary efforts — something that Bacow acknowledged by having Radcliffe serve as the anchor for the brand-new Initiative on Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery. Perhaps it belongs as a separate institute reporting directly to the provost, who oversees inter-school initiatives.
A University-wide initiative on climate change research — from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to the Kennedy School, Graduate School of Design, School of Public Health, and beyond — should be Harvard’s environmental commitment to our community and to our future. Despite early support for the idea among administrators, no serious efforts have materialized. It is the perfect compromise position, promising even more impact than divestment itself.
As climate change rises to become one of the most critical public policy challenges of the modern era, there is no better way for Harvard to embrace its public service mission than by being at the forefront of developing solutions.
President Bacow — when are you announcing Harvard’s University-wide initiative on climate change research?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In late August I spoke with an old Russian woman. I had never met her, and I never will.
I called her to see if she was voting in the Massachusetts Senate Democratic Primary. I spent much of my summer making those campaign cold calls, and I was usually cut off after that initial question.
She and I spoke for over two hours.
I learned that she lives alone, and does not have many people with whom she can discuss politics. She emigrated before the fall of the Soviet Union and still feels grateful for grocery stores.
She told me that she had been a staunch Democrat since she stepped foot in the United States, but was now losing faith. For her, seeing Democratic leaders kneel and side with protesters amid mass looting and anarchy revealed a weakness and hatred for their country that she couldn’t stomach.
After a long pause, she said something I remember viscerally: “Where I come from, your leader kneels only when someone has a gun to his neck.”
This stuck with me but I’m still not sure what she meant. Perhaps she was recalling weak-willed local leaders who were mere puppets of a larger autocracy. Maybe it was a much broader claim, that strength and force — which she felt she could no longer find in the Democratic party — were, in her experience, the ultimate metrics of leadership.
I disagree with her stance on the protests completely: To me, the demonstrations have been a long-fated reckoning, and the Democratic Party’s choice to kneel was distasteful not because of the legitimacy it afforded protesters but because it reeked of performance and accomplished nothing.
Intellectually I was frustrated, even repulsed by this woman, whose arguments sounded like Fox News headlines jammed in a washing machine. But I also felt an unexpectedly acute sympathy for her — she, who grew up without the freedoms offered (ostensibly) by democracy and capitalism, coming to this country and finding leaders ready to give it all away; she, who responded to my decision to skip lunch and continue our conversation with an affectionate disapproval I associate faintly with my grandmother, who always wanted me to eat more.
That nascent but deeply affecting tie I felt to her did not affect my views on the protests. But our conversation unsettled me. I grew reticent and defensive with her. I eventually ended the conversation with a flimsy excuse and hollow guilt. Not only had I failed to convince her of anything — a heavy blow for a college debater — I had cut her off with the knowledge that our conversation might be her only one that day.
In the days after our call I was able to be more reflective. I realized I had let my political ideology circumscribe my empathy. And while this habit is unfortunately common in an era of polarization, it seems particularly pernicious among progressives engaging with immigrants.
We cannot value immigrants’ lived experiences only when those experiences inform politics we like. My surprise at making a connection with the woman I spoke with is itself surprising and frankly disturbing — indicative of both my inability to come to terms with the emotional and embodied nature of political discourse, and the toxic standard of perfect liberalism to which we hold immigrants.
With issues like criminal justice, reparations, and illegal immigration, progressives cannot project uniformly left-of-center ideas onto immigrants.
In 2017, amid uncertainty about the future of DACA and asylum policy, Democratic lawmakers in Maryland tried to create a sanctuary county for undocumented immigrants. Despite the majority Democratic area, the bill failed: It was passionately opposed by legal immigrants, a turn of events that shocked and antagonized progressives. The tacit assumption that immigrants would support liberal immigration reform was homogenizing, erroneous, and fatal.
But Maryland Democrats statewide did not take enough notice. Months later, a similar sanctuary city proposal was made in the state legislature. It also failed despite a two to one Democratic majority, in part because of objections made by some of the same legal immigrants.
I did not hear much about illegal immigration while I phone banked. But people I called frequently brought up reparations, often framing it as a yes-no debate demarcated by a party line. Those who most fervently opposed reparations echoed a sentiment I have heard from friends, parents of friends, and other strangers: They did not feel that they should bear the same guilt for America’s sins as people with centuries of ancestors here.
With race-related issues, immigration necessitates more nuanced analysis than it has tended to receive. Immigrants are subject to the precarity of racial capitalism, with visas determined by market whims and ethnic origin. But they are also settlers on stolen land, who often reap benefits from the vestiges of slavery. And immigrants from “non-shithole countries,” as President Trump would put it, are weaponized as successful American dream stories to mask structural discrimination in education, hiring, wealth, and more.
I don’t know where that leads us, and I had trouble articulating any of it to the woman on the phone. Her decades of life (understandably) mattered more to her than the vaguely Marxist ramblings of a teenager.
But our conversation was meaningful. It reminded me that empathy can coexist with unflinching political demands, and that disagreement should fuel reflection rather than dogma. And I hope that she is a little bit more open to civil disobedience, the way I am now a little bit more grateful for my local supermarket.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amid an ongoing cultural reckoning that’s spotlighted anti-Black racism in the U.S, educators around the country are searching for new ways to teach Black history in their classrooms. To this end, many public school districts are incorporating the New York Times’ “The 1619 Project” into their curriculum. The 1619 Project is an interactive project (originally consisting of essays, poems, fiction, and photos, now adapted into a podcast and free online curriculum) that reexamines U.S history by centering African slavery in our understanding of America’s past and present, beginning in 1619 — the year the first slave ship arrived on America's shores. The effort positions slavery — often woefully mistaught in U.S schools — and its legacy as critical to understanding wide-ranging aspects of American society and history.
The 1619 Project being incorporated into schools has drawn outrage and criticism from Republican lawmakers. In July, Senator Tom Cotton ’98 (R-Ark.), a former Crimson Editorial editor, introduced a bill that would prohibit distributing federal funding to K-12 schools and school districts that teach The 1619 Project. Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich have argued that The 1619 Project is un-American propaganda, and that its incorporation in educational curriculum encourages the revision and politicization of American history.
Ever upping the ante, President Donald Trump tweeted on Sept. 6 that the Department of Justice will investigate whether California public school districts are using the project in their curriculum. He warns such schools will be defunded.
Public school curriculum generally does not adequately cover racial history. As a result, horror stories of teachers instructing students to list the pros of slavery and orchestrating mock slave auctions abound. We oppose any attempts to hinder improving slavery’s teaching in the U.S, recognizing the damage an inadequate racial education can cause. When American history is taught without the nuance racial history provides, educators risk cultivating students with damaged perceptions of the world.
The stakes of understating the impacts of American slavery are high. Educators must intentionally teach students about the formation and development of oppressive institutions and systems in the U.S, because, without understanding their legacies, dismaying statistics and blight in Black communities in the U.S can appear to be matters of personal responsibility, not facets of the long shadow of slavery. The absence of Black history in curriculums hinders the cultivation of empathy and denies students critical context needed to engage with racial issues and racial identity.
To deem centering this history as un-American suggests a dangerous idea of what it means to be American.
Labeling The 1619 Project as such suggests that Black history in the U.S. is not American history. It implies that it is un-American to recognize violence and discrimination against Black people. Ultimately, it suggests that validating the experiences of Black Americans is inherently un-American — a nasty undercurrent likely underpinning the largely white history we are taught in schools.
Examples set by other countries that rigorously teach their ugly racial pasts should dispel fears that projects like The 1619 Project will inspire a decline in patriotism. See Germany, where concentration camps are used as teaching sites to impress upon students the horrors of anti-Semitism, or South Africa, where national pride soars even after the country undertook a national truth-telling initiative to address its long history of institutionalized racism under apartheid. Despite these countries’ pasts and their acknowledgements of horrifying wrongdoing, patriotism lives on. Germany and South Africa signal that America’s students need not be exposed to a solely positive (and consequently, incomplete) version of history to be patriotic.
Trump's reaction to The 1619 Project strikes us as a barefaced attempt to score political points and pander to growing conservative opposition to cultural sensitivity efforts, rather than legitimate historical criticism. His threat to defund California schools who teach The 1619 Project is authoritarian and undemocratic — an attempt to outlaw readings of history that displease him.
This attempt to censor our collective memory is an encroachment upon American freedom: textbook dictator-style. This is not how any normal democratic government would operate, but it has become a trademark of this president: threatening to withhold federal fundings as a political gimmick, as he did earlier this year to pressure K-12 to reopen in person despite the COVID-19 pandemic.
Without rich primary source materials to expose children to the hard truths of slavery in America, indifference to generations of routinized, legally sanctioned murder, sexual violence, and forced labor can run rampant. Politics that denounce the legitimacy of the needs of Black and other marginalized communities, that diminish and seek to control their histories, and that perpetuate their oppression do so on the back of that indifference. Education is the best hope against that indifference, and the cruel policies it sustains.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Massachusetts Department of Public Health announced Thursday four new human cases of West Nile virus in the state this year, bringing the state’s total case count in 2020 to seven. Three of the four cases were exposed to the virus in Middlesex County, while the fourth case originated from Bristol County.
Due to the emergence of these cases, Cambridge, Newton, Somerville, and Watertown have been elevated to “high risk” for West Nile virus. Several other towns in Middlesex County, as well as three in Bristol County, have been elevated to “moderate risk.”
The three Middlesex County cases are all males — one in his 40s, one in his 60s, and one in his 80s. The fourth is a female under the age of 19.
The Cambridge Public Health Department issued its own statement on Friday, reporting that six of the seven human cases from this year were exposed or live in Middlesex County, but none are Cambridge residents.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, West Nile virus is “the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the continental United States.” It is most commonly transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito.
The Commonwealth’s press release also stated that most people infected with the virus do not experience symptoms. If symptoms do manifest, they typically include fever and flu-like illness. People over the age of 50 are at a greater risk of severe illness.
In Cambridge’s press release, Claude A. Jacob, Chief Public Health Officer and director of the Cambridge Public Health Department, said that while mosquito populations are declining at the end of summer, a higher proportion of the populations are infected.
“For this reason, residents should continue to take the precautions to protect themselves from mosquito bites when outside in the evening and early morning hours,” he said.
The Cambridge press release also reported the risk of mosquito-borne disease is present typically until early November, when the first hard frost usually occurs.
In its press release, the Cambridge Department of Public Health also included tips to avoiding mosquito bites, such as applying insect repellent when outdoors, being aware of peak mosquito-biting times, wearing protective clothing, removing mosquito breeding sites from yards, and making sure window and door screens are in good condition.
The press release also advised people to contact a nurse or doctor if they have symptoms of West Nile virus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The American Repertory Theater, led by Artistic Director Diane M. Paulus and Executive Producer Diane Borger, announced initial steps toward establishing its commitment to anti-racism on its website earlier this month. The outlined plan — which was released in response to demands penned by the A.R.T. People of Color Affinity Group in June as well as the national “We See You, White American Theater” campaign — includes implementing staff-wide training on implicit bias, opening channels for staff feedback to ensure accountability, and conducting an audit of institutional culture.
The A.R.T. announcement also stated that the institution will release quarterly summary reports regarding the status of the outlined commitments, the first of which will be published by November 16.
Both Paulus and Borger declined to comment on the new plan. Paulus, who is a member of the Harvard faculty and won a Tony Award in 2013, was accused in June of racism by Griffin Matthews, a black writer and actor who worked on a show at the A.R.T. with Paulus in 2014.
In a statement published online, Paulus and Borger wrote that they hope these commitments will contribute to “centering anti-racism as a core value” at the A.R.T.
“In late June, we implemented a staff-led search process that centered BIPOC employees and included representation from our Boards and external stakeholders to select a consultant to work with the A.R.T moving forward,” the statement reads. “This September, we begin a journey with Lisa Yancey and Yancey Consulting to build anti-racist practices into the A.R.T.’s structure, culture, and governance.”
Anti-Racism Engagement Co-Lead Alexandra B. Daniels, one of the co-writers of the A.R.T. PoC Affinity Group statement, described the group’s letter as having provided “a starting place” for the A.R.T. to implement anti-racist policies following national protests for racial justice.
“Just like we also say in the letter, everything that was discussed had been brought up before with little to no action taken,” Daniels said.
The letter put forth several specific action items which the POC Affinity Group members collectively agreed upon, including hiring more people of color in full-time leadership roles, investing in Boston-area communities of color, and breaking down barriers for diverse audiences to engage with programming.
“In the A.R.T.’s most recent statement about Black Lives Matter, the theater made the claim that this organization is committed to dismantling white supremacy, however many Black and other employees of color have not experienced the safe haven that the A.R.T. is supposed to facilitate,” the June statement reads. “In order for the A.R.T. to make this claim, we demand tangible steps in this process in lieu of vague language.”
“We would not be doing this work if we did not care about the future of the institution,” the statement adds. “This document is the culmination of a lot of labor and a lot more love for the American Repertory Theater, past, current, and future employees of color, and theatre at large.”
A.R.T. Anti-Racism Engagement Co-Lead Julia Schachnik wrote in an email she feels inspired by the “commitment to share power and space” she sees beginning to take place at the A.R.T., yet noted that these institutional changes are “just beginning at the theater.”
“As we work with our consultant, create more opportunities for staff to engage with each other, and have more and more conversations about what anti-racism at our theater can look like, the more the theater will truly become a place where each person connected to it will feel respected and heard,” Schachnik wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From the visa issues that have kept freshmen off campus to the trans-Atlantic time differences that complicate their online coursework, international students have faced significant challenges at the start of the virtual fall semester. Harvard alumni around the globe say they want to help make their experience easier.
With over 370,000 alumni, Harvard boasts more than 195 alumni clubs across the world. The University also has Shared Interest Groups, connecting alumni to particular activities, identity groups, professions, or cultures.
Yoshiko J. “June” Nagao ’96, who serves on the board of the Harvard Club of Japan and previously served as a Harvard Alumni Association Director for Asia-Pacific Alumni Clubs, said alumni can help fill the gaps by providing mentorship and internship advice to students outside of the United States.
“I think where we can really add value is, for instance, one-on-one mentoring,” Nagao said. “A lot of our alumni are willing to either provide mentorship or internship opportunities.”
Though the pandemic poses challenges for all, Theresa S. Cho ’90 — who serves as an HAA Director for Asia-Pacific Alumni Clubs and Shared Interest Groups — said international students face additional layers of “uncertainty.”
In particular, she said she is concerned for freshmen, noting many have never seen Harvard Yard or traveled to Cambridge.
“I think that’s where the local alumni can come in and play a really proactive role in acting as a liaison between Harvard, where they’re going to learn, and the local environment, where they need to continue learning,” Cho said.
She added that alumni can also act in a supportive role closer to home.
“Because we are so much closer to the students themselves, this physical proximity gives us a unique way to help the University,” Cho said.
Robert G. “Bob” Manson, who serves as an HAA Director for Europe Clubs and SIGs, said international alumni are discussing how they can best support students who have either chosen to enroll or defer.
“For those students that have chosen to not defer, how do we support them in their studies, particularly when there are possibly financial challenges to be met?” he said. “Then for those students that have chosen to defer, how do we put them in contact with the international alumni community or the alumni community in their home country?”
He said their conversations are not centered on the need to mobilize alumni but rather “raising awareness” among the existing alumni network and encouraging its members to rally around students at this time.
Santiago Creuheras, a recently elected HAA Director, said alumni are planning activities like office hours and happy hours for international students through Harvard Clubs worldwide.
“We are also trying to provide support for the families of the off campus students,” he said.
Denise A. Silber, who serves as a Vice President of the Harvard Club of France, said her club recently hosted an event about how to spend free time that provided a space for attendees to connect with one another.
Silber also noted concerns about how students will connect with the clubs to receive support. Due to privacy concerns, the University cannot send clubs a list of the students in a given country, she said. As a result, students must opt-in to receive information from the clubs.
“They have to even know this thing exists that they could ask about,” she said.
She called on the University to raise awareness about the existence of the clubs by including their information in initial emails to newly admitted students and offering to connect them with alumni based on their geography or shared interests.
University Spokesperson Christopher M. Hennessy wrote in an email to The Crimson that the alumni association provides “robust infrastructure” for connections between students and alumni.
“The HAA provides a robust infrastructure for all alumni to connect with each other in their home communities and encourages and supports students in building connections with those alumni communities,” Hennessy wrote.
Pavlos P. Photiades ’88, an HAA Director for Europe, said alumni from clubs in his region are “reaching out to offer their advice and help” to freshmen, but he acknowledged that interfacing with alumni is not a replacement for connecting with their peers.
“You can imagine, especially for people who have never set foot on Harvard, and they've started classes, they must be really overwhelmed,” he said. “Older alumni are not in such a good position to help.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
John Della Volpe, who has steered the Harvard Institute of Politics’s polling initiatives for the last 20 years, is taking leave from his main role at the IOP in order to consult for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s presidential campaign.
Della Volpe’s polling company, SocialSphere, has been brought on as one of six public opinion consultants being used by the Biden camp. Della Volpe, whose research has focused on youth political engagement, comes as Biden is working to make inroads with younger voters — a demographic he failed to woo during the Democratic primaries.
Della Volpe wrote in a statement to The Crimson that he will continue to work on strategic planning for the IOP’s Youth Poll, but will step back from the project’s day-to-day operations.
“While I have remained fiercely non-partisan over my years at the IOP, the critical role Gen Z and Millennials can play in the election, and knowing how important a priority the youth vote is to this election has prompted my decision to re-engage in politics and do my part,” Della Volpe wrote.
Biden struggled to win over young voters by large margins, even as he consolidated broad support among other demographic groups in the final spate of primaries, during which he faced off against United States Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Sanders has been lobbying Biden to conduct more outreach to young people and Latinx voters — two groups Sanders won by a landslide in the primaries.
The spring 2020 iteration of the IOP’s Youth Poll, which Della Volpe oversaw, showed Biden with a 23-point lead over Trump among 18- to 29-year-olds. But Biden’s low favorability among young adult voters, shown in other recent surveys, have made focusing on bolstering youth turnout crucial for the campaign.
Chase H. Harrison, the associate director of the Harvard Program on Survey Research and preceptor in survey methods in the Government Department, will step in to oversee the Harvard Public Opinion Project while Della Volpe is on leave.
The Harvard Public Opinion Project, one of 16 programs offered by the IOP, produces a biannual opinion poll of 18- to 29-year-olds nationwide. Harrison, who has taught at Harvard since 2006, said he hopes to integrate HPOP’s work into his and other courses within the Government Department.
“I think that it’s great that he’s taking all this knowledge to the Biden campaign and really making sure that people there are paying attention to the importance of the youth vote in 2020,” K. Cathy Sun ’22 said of Della Volpe. “I think he’s doing great work there to take the contributions of HPOP members over the past two decades and bringing all that institutional knowledge over to the Biden campaign.”
Sun — who chaired the IOP’s Public Opinion Project in the spring semester but is currently on leave from the College — said she thinks the IOP, too, will benefit from Della Volpe returning with insight about how the program “can best engage with political campaigns and operatives and stakeholders” going forward.
“Where prior, I think, presidential campaigns really have not emphasized outreach to young people all that much, I think John has already been able to carve out a space for that and pivot their attention to it,” Sun said.
At the IOP, Della Volpe oversees the administrative aspect of HPOP, but leaves much of the substantive work and day-t0-day operations in the hands of students.
“We’re obviously sad,” said Justin Y. Tseng ’22, who is currently serving as chair of the program. “He’s quite an iconic figure within HPOP.”
“We are super excited for him, though,” Tseng said, adding that working on the Biden campaign is “a great way for him to serve his country.”
Harrison said he isn’t worried about the reputation or content of the poll suffering after Della Volpe returns to the IOP in the spring semester, fresh off working in a partisan manner.
“John has developed this expertise in a non-partisan way,” Harrison said. “And it’s been a rigorously non-partisan poll. I don’t see any reason why it wouldn’t continue to operate with the same non-partisan rigor and approach that it always has. I wouldn’t have any concerns about the nature of this project changing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council unanimously approved a measure Monday evening requesting city personnel to support Black and minority business owners applying for financial assistance from the Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund.
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui and City Manager Louis A. DePasquale activated the Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund in March to provide emergency assistance to residents experiencing financial hardship due to the coronavirus pandemic. The fund also provides grants of up to $10,000 to businesses, which do not need to be repaid.
In an April interview with The Crimson, Siddiqui said the fund was an important resource for helping constituents.
“We want to make sure that people are being housed, are being fed, have their basic needs, and it’s not going to be perfect. We aren't reaching everyone,” Siddiqui said at the time. “It's something that we have to constantly monitor.”
The fund, comprised of donations from residents and local corporations, totaled more than $4.7 million as of Aug. 20. The city has already distributed roughly $3.7 million to individuals, families, and local businesses.
As of July, however, some local small businesses stated “they had not previously heard about this program” and “they had been unfairly left out of consideration for obtaining these critical funds,” per the policy order submitted by City Councilor E. Denise Simmons.
“Day after day, week after week, my office...has been contacted by individuals who are saying: ‘I applied, I didn't get any money,’ ‘I didn't know there was a program,’ or ‘I didn't have a technical support to make it work,’” Simmons said during Monday’s council meeting.
“We have to find ways that are stringent — intentional — to reach out to these groups,” she added.
Simmons’s policy order seeks to ensure all businesses are given “every reasonable opportunity to participate” in the program.
The measure urges the City Manager’s office to direct its outreach methods to the city’s Black and minority-owned small businesses. It also requests the City Manager and the Community Development Department provide technical support to underrepresented business owners seeking funds from the Mayor’s Disaster Relief program, as well as for similar state and federal programs.
Other businesses that the policy order targets are businesses that are not part of neighborhood business associations and businesses that do not rely heavily on electronic communication.
Simmons said the City must conduct outreach to vulnerable businesses to ensure they are not overlooked when it comes to receiving assistance from the fund.
“I have to believe that we want to make sure that we want to reach everyone. That what we love about Cambridge is its cultural diversity,” she said. “But if we are not intentional about how we reach out to those groups, we're going to miss them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A 20-page report on the election and function of Harvard’s Board of Overseers reveals details about how the second-highest governing body leads the University, in addition to issuing recommendations about future Overseer elections.
Members of a special committee of the Board of Overseers’s Election Working Group submitted the report to the Harvard Corporation and Board of Overseers on July 31 and released it to the public Tuesday.
The committee was led by Margaret H. Marshall, the former chief justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, and composed of past Overseers Susan L. Carney ’73 and Tracy P. Palandjian ’93, current Overseer Paul L. Choi ’86, and past Harvard Alumni Association Presidents Walter H. Morris Jr. ’73 and Margaret M. Wang ’09.
The committee issued several recommendations, approved by the Harvard Corporation and Board of Overseers, including limiting the number of members of the Board of Overseers who are petition candidates to six of 30, and “monitoring” future elections to the Board.
Amid its formal recommendations, though, it also contains a trove of information about the University's sometimes-opaque governance structure.
The Harvard Corporation — made up by the president, treasurer, and 11 fellows — is responsible for institutional strategy, the annual budget, the endowment, and appointments of top administrators, including the University President.
Like the Corporation, the role of the 30-member Board of Overseers has at times been ambiguous to the public. The new report outlines some of the Board’s most important functions in the University.
The report states that the “chief responsibility” of the Board of Overseers is the “visitation process,” which it calls the “primary means for periodic external review and assessment” of various parts of the University — including academic departments, the College, graduate and professional schools, the Harvard Library, the Harvard Art Museum, athletics, and information technology.
The Board of Overseers is tasked with directing the visitation process through its standing committees and approximately 50 visiting committees that answer to it, the report states.
Each visiting committee meets on campus for two days to “conduct intensive reviews,” before preparing “detailed reports of their observations and recommendations” for the members of the Board of Overseers’ standing committees to consider.
Those Overseers, then, meet with “relevant deans, department chairs, and visiting committee chairs to discuss key opportunities and challenges facing the visited units."
On top of the visitation process, the report notes that the Board of Overseers provides “confidential counsel” to leaders of the University and has the “power of consent” to some actions of the Harvard Corporation.
The report also emphasizes how University officials envision the ideal member of the Board of Overseers.
"The essence of the Overseers’ role, as members of a university-wide governing body, is not to serve the interests of particular constituencies or to act as advocates for specific policy objectives — however worthy those interests or objectives might be — but to focus on ensuring that Harvard as a whole will continue to thrive in pursuing its expansive and multifaceted mission of education and research in service of the larger society,” the report reads.
It lists a number of characteristics of potential Overseers that members of the nominating committee are asked to consider: “experience in an academic or professional domain”; an interest in higher education; an “understanding of complex organizations”; leadership and consensus-building skills; and “a broad concern for Harvard as a whole.”
Part of its recommendation that the University “monitor” future campaigns for the Board of Overseers centers on the concern that candidates will focus on single issues, rather than the overall University.
“Candidates elected with the benefit of financial and other support from organized issue-driven groups may well come to the role of Overseer feeling a responsibility to promote and achieve the stated objectives of such groups, whereas the role of Overseer entails serving the interests of the University as a whole, not of particular constituencies,” the report reads.
The most recent petition campaigns for the Board of Overseers were issue-driven — in 2015, a slate of five candidates who favored eliminating tuition and affirmative action ran as “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard,” and this year, a slate of five candidates who support divestment the endowment from fossil fuels ran as “Harvard Forward.” Though the former failed to elect any candidates to the Board, the latter succeeded in electing three Overseers earlier this summer.
That sort of special interest proved unappealinf to University officials, per the report.
“We believe the sound governance of the University risks erosion if Overseers elections come to be seen less as a means to consider which individuals would be best suited to perform the Board’s governance role, and more a means for alumni to register their views on contested questions of policy,” the report concludes.

A core component of Harvard’s Fall reopening plan is its high-frequency viral testing for everyone returning to campus, also known as sticking a giant Q-tip up your nose every two to three days. While you know the boy standing exactly 56 feet away from you in the Yard has booger-free nostrils, what happens if your COVID tests come back indeterminate or (gasp) positive?
Testing
For students living in on-campus housing, testing has meant receiving a baseline COVID-19 test in the Science Center upon arrival to campus, then quarantining in two phases, each corresponding to a different level of restrictions. According to the procedure, students will have completed the second phase after their third negative test. Upon completion, they’ll proceed with switching over to unobserved, self-administered tests three times a week (I guess we’re all on the pre-med track now). Students won’t receive testing results until two days later, through the Broad Institute’s online portal system (at least this one doesn’t have Duo login).
Testing Positive
So what if you test positive? According to HUHS’s policies on viral testing, “a medical professional from HUHS will contact you and discuss next steps. You will be required to remain in isolation for at least 14 days.” An invalid or indeterminate test means another nose swab is looming in your future. You’ll also be contacted by a HUHS medical professional and later reached out to by an HUHS contact tracer — an exciting social interaction prospect for freshmen.
Through a 20 to 30 minute interview, the tracer will connect you to additional resources according to your needs and barriers to self-isolation, identify your proximal and close contacts over the past several days, and perform daily check-ins throughout the isolation period. Isolation locations will vary depending on your current housing situation. However, regardless of location, the protocol remains the same: Students will have to stay in their room for around 10 t0 14 days.
If Your Friend Tests Positive 
If you test positive, the people directly exposed to you will have to receive a daily check-in and may be referred to additional testing (see this graphic for an aesthetically pleasing and informative guide). Harvard’s coronavirus policies FAQ adds that the Department of Public Health will only contact students deemed to be at an increased risk for contracting the virus because of close contact with another student who tested positive (it seems like good ol’ Harvard is selective to the end). Since all contact tracing communications through the College fall under a policy of confidentiality, it is up to each student whether, upon receiving a positive test result, they feel comfortable doing additional outreach to individuals they’re been around.
Students Living Off-Campus
Students learning remotely — including those living in the Cambridge/Boston area, deluding themselves that they’re living their regular on-campus lives — likely won’t receive regular screening tests. Only remote learning students with symptoms or close contact to someone who tested positive are allowed to be tested through a HUHS clinic — which may result in asymptomatic cases going unreported. Testing options also vary for remote students who have opted out of the student health insurance plan. Harvard has recommended that these individuals discuss testing options with their personal primary care physicians, especially if they experience COVID-19 or flu-like symptoms.
Academic Concerns
Though Harvard has expressed that a school representative will contact on-campus students daily “regarding academic support, the specifics for supporting your isolation period, and to address any other needed supports,” common practical academic concerns go largely unaddressed in email correspondence and the fall plan. College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email to Flyby that “students should notify their professors in the ordinary way. The processes for requesting extensions are no different this year than in years past. If students require medical intervention off campus, the College will continue to support students via the academic and residential support structures that are in place.”
Furthermore, students testing positive for COVID-19 while learning remotely are on their own in trying to get guidance on these topics, even though procedures for who students should notify and how have yet to be clearly established. In the meantime, with many academic procedures unchanged or not outlined for this fall, we strongly encourage you to reach out to your House deans and professors to clarify any concerns you have sooner rather than later.

With the start of the remote semester, looking at old pictures of Harvard Yard and your friend’s Instagram Stories of campus aren’t cutting it anymore. We all miss Harvard, and even for those on campus, life just isn’t the same. But who says your new life can’t look a bit more like the Harvard of the past?
Room Makeover: Home Edition
You can admit it… you kind of miss your old twin-sized bed and, some nights, maybe even the top bunk. Have no fear: You can buy some bed risers or even make your own so that you can fit your dresser under your bed and get that dorm chic look. While you’re at it, replace your nice comfortable desk chair with one of the many famous Harvard chairs. One option is what the COOP calls the “Original Harvard Chair,” but if you want to bring the outside in, opt for one of those Harvard Yard chairs you’ve been missing a little extra lately.
While you’re redecorating, get yourself a John Harvard replica desk statue or a beautiful print of the iconic tourist attraction — just make sure not to spill any specific liquids on this version. If you want to add a more casual touch, why not store your shower caddy in your off-campus room to remind yourself of your freshman experience? We’ve heard this look really goes well with polaroid photos you took after a long night out with some friends. Corral all your memories together and spotlight your class (or your would-be class, if you’re taking a leave of absence) and finally hang up your class photo next to your Harvard pendant, just to remind the people in your Zoom section that you are, in fact, a Harvard student.
Bring the Dhall Home 
Who says trays are just reserved for Annenberg and upperclassman housing? Swipe into your kitchen (or show your parents your ID card), grab a tray and load up on some HUDS recreations — this way it’s easier to bring your snacks to your room anyway. If you only have a short break in between your classes and are feeling nostalgic for the quick trips to FlyBy, go ahead and pack yourself a PB&J, some carrots, or maybe even some tomato ravioli soup.
Harvard Conversation Starters 
It’s been a while since we’ve heard the perfunctory “Let’s grab a meal sometime” line. Recreate this feeling at home by telling your parents or roommates that you should schedule a time to hangout, and pull out your GCal only to find that you’re too busy this week… maybe next week! If you’re also missing spontaneous run-ins with your friends, FaceTime or Zoom them at random times of the day to make things feel just a bit more natural.
Add some personal Harvard touches to your childhood bedroom, off-campus apartment, or even your dorm to bring yourself back to pre-March 2020 times. But make sure to also create new memories, routines, and habits that you can bring back with you whenever we do return to campus.
